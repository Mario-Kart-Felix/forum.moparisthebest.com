    <title>9/11</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/9-11/46484</link>
    <description>There is a wealth of information freely available on the internet, and hopefully soon, in the televised and newsprint media as well, on what really happened on 9/11. [url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5236492071990669218]Here[/url] [url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6837001821567284154&amp;q=9%2F11+commision]here[/url] and [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKnp6XsCo4]here[/url] are good places to start.


In the mainstream media, in the US, there is no voice of dissent. Make some noise, tell your friends and your enemies, spread the word. Nobody is going to stand up on the evening news and say &quot;I&#39;m sorry...but this is all bullshit. Bush knocked down the towers.&quot; At least, not for a while. Make that day come a little sooner, spread the word.

<p>We should compare it with the only 2 rooms on fire and most of the gas and oil exploding outside the building also. Me personally I believe what I see and I watched the movie, and those that were inside at the time and made it out alive I believe them over what anyone says, picture is proof reading is not and I saw all the picture I need to of changed my mind.</p>

<p>[quote=Mopar]Proof please?</p>

</aside>
<p>Inconsistencies in the 9/11 Commission report.</p>
<p>[quote=David Ray Griffin] 1. The omission of evidence that at least six of the alleged hijackers — including Waleed al-Shehri, said by the Commission probably to have stabbed a flight attendant on Flight 11 before it crashed into the North Tower of the WTC — are still alive (19-20).</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The omission of evidence about Mohamed Atta — such as his reported fondness for alcohol, pork, and lap dances — that is in tension with the Commission’s claim that he had become fanatically religious (20-21).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The obfuscation of the evidence that Hani Hanjour was too poor a pilot to have flown an airliner into the Pentagon (21-22).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the publicly released flight manifests contain no Arab names (23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that fire has never, before or after 9/11, caused steel-frame buildings to collapse (25).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the fires in the Twin Towers were not very big, very hot, or very long-lasting compared with fires in several steel-frame buildings that did not collapse (25-26).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that, given the hypothesis that the collapses were caused by fire, the South Tower, which was struck later than the North Tower and also had smaller fires, should not have collapsed first (26).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>…[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>That list is the biggest bunch of bullshit I have ever seen, obviously someone with absolutely no knowledge of engineering or architecture wrote that up.  Not to mention the other points that are just flat out stupid.</p>
<p>Whoever believes that is an idiot.</p>

Considering the towers were not only being held up by steel but concrete and there was only a few rooms on fire not half the building its kind of funny how that happens… and the empire state building never fell when it got hit about 40 years ago… also im not sure if your aware that MOST OF THE FUEL BLEW UP OUTSIDE THE TOWERS… not on the inside there was firefighters that reported back that they could secure the blaze with just 2 hoses if it was something big that could take down a building they would need more than 2 don’t you think?? i sure do[br][size=1]Posted on: January 11, 2007, 07:41:33 PM[/size][hr][quote=“Gotta Catch Them All, post:6, topic:46484”]<a href="http://69.28.73.17/911ontrial.doc/cdt911.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://69.28.73.17/911ontrial.doc/cdt911.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the WTC towers were designed to withstand the impact from a Boeing 707 (similar to a Boeing 767), and each floor was designed to hold 2,600,000 pounds beyond its own weight. Likewise, the steel used in these structures was rated to hold five-times its normal load. MIT professor Thomas Eager admitted as much when declaring, “The impact of the airplanes would have been insignificant” in toppling the towers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Saying that the towers were designed to withstand the impact from a Boeing 707 does not mean that they are 100% fool proof, there would be a margin for error.</p>
<p>I believe that it was Bin Laden who carried out this attack and not the American government. No government, no matter how corrupt, would trick their own country by killing thousands of innocent people and destroying two famous buildings imo.[/quote]</p>
<p>A good way to go to war to finish off what daddy started right bush is not even looking for him anymore he is finishing what daddy started…</p>
<p>Edit: if you don’t think the government was not behind it please tell me how the black box one of the most indistructable objects ever made BOTH were not found? but a paper book that can light on fire with a cigar was found on the streets not burned scratched stepped on bloody perfect mint condition?<br>
President bush could of had jets scrambled the second he knew the planes were hijacked not shoot them just yet but after the first building was hit he did jack shit after the second one was hit then he scrambled the jets? GTFO you dont scramble jets when there is no more hijacked planes in the air…</p>
<p>Second Edit: When is the last time anyone heard anything on the news about osama?? i have not seen anything since 2 months after the attacks only about suddam and we hung him we had no business to ne there and kill their leader he did jack shit to America but the guy who “blew up the towers” he is not that important huh the guy that did shit to us is more important…</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in the 9/11 Commission report.</p>
<blockquote>1. The omission of evidence that at least six of the alleged hijackers — including Waleed al-Shehri, said by the Commission probably to have stabbed a flight attendant on Flight 11 before it crashed into the North Tower of the WTC — are still alive (19-20).
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The omission of evidence about Mohamed Atta — such as his reported fondness for alcohol, pork, and lap dances — that is in tension with the Commission’s claim that he had become fanatically religious (20-21).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The obfuscation of the evidence that Hani Hanjour was too poor a pilot to have flown an airliner into the Pentagon (21-22).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the publicly released flight manifests contain no Arab names (23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that fire has never, before or after 9/11, caused steel-frame buildings to collapse (25).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the fires in the Twin Towers were not very big, very hot, or very long-lasting compared with fires in several steel-frame buildings that did not collapse (25-26).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that, given the hypothesis that the collapses were caused by fire, the South Tower, which was struck later than the North Tower and also had smaller fires, should not have collapsed first (26).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that WTC 7 (which was not hit by an airplane and which had only small, localized fires) also collapsed — an occurrence that FEMA admitted it could not explain (26).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the collapse of the Twin Towers (like that of Building 7) exemplified at least 10 features suggestive of controlled demolition (26-27).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The claim that the core of each of the Twin Towers was “a hollow steel shaft” — a claim that denied the existence of the 47 massive steel columns that in reality constituted the core of each tower and that, given the “pancake theory” of the collapses, should have still been sticking up many hundreds of feet in the air (27-28).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of Larry Silverstein’s statement that he and the fire department commander decided to “pull” Building 7 (28).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the steel from the WTC buildings was quickly removed from the crime scene and shipped overseas before it could be analyzed for evidence of explosives (30).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that because Building 7 had been evacuated before it collapsed, the official reason for the rapid removal of the steel — that some people might still be alive in the rubble under the steel — made no sense in this case (30).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of Mayor Giuliani’s statement that he had received word that the World Trade Center was going to collapse (30-31).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that President Bush’s brother Marvin and his cousin Wirt Walker III were both principals in the company in charge of security for the WTC (31-32).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that the west wing of the Pentagon would have been the least likely spot to be targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists, for several reasons (33-34).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of any discussion of whether the damage done to the Pentagon was consistent with the impact of a Boeing 757 going several hundred miles per hour (34).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that there are photos showing that the west wing’s façade did not collapse until 30 minutes after the strike and also that the entrance hole appears too small for a Boeing 757 to have entered (34).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of all testimony that has been used to cast doubt on whether remains of a Boeing 757 were visible either inside or outside the Pentagon (34-36).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of any discussion of whether the Pentagon has a anti-missile defense system that would have brought down a commercial airliner — even though the Commission suggested that the al-Qaeda terrorists did not attack a nuclear power plant because they assumed that it would be thus defended (36).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the fact that pictures from various security cameras — including the camera at the gas station across from the Pentagon, the film from which was reportedly confiscated by the FBI immediately after the strike — could presumably answer the question of what really hit the Pentagon (37-38).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld’s reference to “the missile [used] to damage [the Pentagon]” (39).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The apparent endorsement of a wholly unsatisfactory answer to the question of why the Secret Service agents allowed President Bush to remain at the Sarasota school at a time when, given the official story, they should have assumed that a hijacked airliner might be about to crash into the school (41-44).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure to explore why the Secret Service did not summon fighter jets to provide air cover for Air Force One (43-46).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The claims that when the presidential party arrived at the school, no one in the party knew that several planes had been hijacked (47-48).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The omission of the report that Attorney General Ashcroft was warned to stop using commercial airlines prior to 9/11 (50).</p>

<blockquote>...an unnamed CIA briefer who flew to Bush's Texas ranch during the scary summer of 2001, amid a flurry of reports of a pending al-Qaeda attack, to call the president's attention personally to the now-famous Aug. 6, 2001, memo titled "Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in US." Bush reportedly heard the briefer out and replied: "All right. You've covered your ass, now."</blockquote>

<p>Maddox is correct in that if somebody actually knew what really happened on 9/11, the government would shut them up. But all the he proves by that is that the truth hasn’t come out. In fact, the government probably helped distribute Loose Change to make sure the 9/11 truth movement would be thought of as a wild conspiracy.</p>
<p>In fact, the official government version of what happened is just as wild a conspiracy theory as the one presented in Loose Change.[/quote]</p>
<p>Proof please?</p>
<p>It makes much more sense that the government’s version is accurate.</p>
