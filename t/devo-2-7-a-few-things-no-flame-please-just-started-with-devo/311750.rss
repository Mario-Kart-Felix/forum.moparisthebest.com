    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/devo-2-7-a-few-things-no-flame-please-just-started-with-devo/311750</link>
    <description>1. 2012&#39;s weapon interfaces, how do I make them work with the server?
2. Adding Quests, how? 
3. Reducing lag, how?
4. Are there skills already in the server, or do I have to add them?
5. How do I remove thread per client?
6. Is there anything to convert in Event manager to use it with Devo?

Will update as I go.</description>

<p>Which Devo? Because Killamess decided to copy it’s name…which was rediculous, but do youmean Killamess’s combat version or Bakatool’s original Devolution?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He specifically stated Devolution 2.7 in his thread title, therefore we can infer that it is Killamess’s.</p>
<p>Now iTang specifically for numbers; <span class="bbcode-b">1,3,5,6</span> there are tutorials and I encourage you to find them, as you will learn alot when you search these forums. You’ll find other tutorials, other posts, other problems, and you will learn from others experiences.</p>
<p>Now if you look through the server folders, you will see a folder: “skills” that will help you understand what skills are already in the server. And if you look through the folders, you’ll see a folder called “quests” work with that, it will show you how quests are added.</p>
<p>If you need guidance, we are here for you, but we expect you to take some initative first. Need more help, just tell me.</p>

              <p>most of these questions you can easily figure out yourself just by playing it and, only one of those questions is even specific to what this boards requirements meet -.-<br>
try editing this topic after you try and figure these things yourself.<br>
honestly… x.x</p>
