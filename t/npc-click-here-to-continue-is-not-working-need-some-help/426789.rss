    <title>Npc &quot;Click here to continue&quot; is not working, Need some help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-click-here-to-continue-is-not-working-need-some-help/426789</link>
    <description>Alright, You know when your talking to a npc and it says &quot;Click here to continue&quot;? Yeh well mine doesn&#39;t work... It just changes to &quot;Please wait...&quot; and never goes away unless I walk away from the npc. Can anyone help me with this? Or at least point me to where them options are held so I can sort it out?

Its a 508 btw.</description>
