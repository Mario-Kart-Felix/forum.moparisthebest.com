        <p>Think about it this way, I had it, I talked to ruler, he would had been the  likely to be the only one that woudl buy it. If I wanted to sell, and he wanted to buy, it could had been done with noone else ever knowing.</p>
<p>Up until litterally a few minutes before I posted the broken bot, 2? people was even aware I even had it, if I had been trying to sell it as as bad as whoever claims I was, am sure all of you guys would had heard about it before regex realized I had it (after I gave him a huge freaking hint…).</p>
<p>When pd, regex, and ruler was (i assume) messing with each ohter and playing around about buying and selling it, I could had just as easily asked ruler at that point if he was really serious…</p>
<p>Dont know who is sayign what, and what leads them to believe I really was, but they obviously got it wrong.</p>
<p>In fact…</p>
<p>Since the only 2 people I am aware of that knew I did have it are both CM’s here.</p>
<p>If the other one that wasnt ruler, that offered a trade for the updater, for something else would like to say what it was, and what my answer was. Feel free to post it. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>It wasnt freely given, and it wasnt stolen.</p>
<p>Explanation.</p>
<p>Even before Aryan went private, niether of us liked being dependant upon others. So we individually was working on rules and make our own updater. Not working together, but we talked at times.</p>
<p>Later on, he gave me a file, forget what it was now, but it was his work, not your guys, and it happened to have his password.</p>
<p>So he didnt realize he was giving it to me, and I never asked or went out of my way to try to get it. He was unlucky, I was lucky bassiclly.</p>
<p>I never offered to sell it, I never offered to trade it, I never gave it away except what you guys know I posted, and thats it.</p>
<p>I did look at the code, implemented some of the ideas into the private Aryan I used, but never even actually used that bot myself (I did use pd’s mapwalking classes though in mine). IMO, neither bot was better as a whole, While I used the public Aryan as a base to work off of, each of the private ones was better in some respects over the other one in the same area.</p>
<p>My interest was peaked about it before hand. The only time I ever asked about working on it with you guys, was I asked regex one time. He didnt like that I had become mod on autorune, and later on impsoft, so he said no. I had not asked, or been asked on either site, I logged in, and thats whne I knew I had been given mod access.</p>
<p>So it was all cool, but the day he went to talking shit, is the day the broken bot was posted. Even on autorune I had asked to be demodded, but they never would, at one time on impsoft I asked, and was removed. So when he was talking crap for no reason, I pretty much said screw you regex by posting the bot…</p>

<p>I will take shit for what I have done, but dont let people mess with me about something I have no control over or if able I will do something for them to have a reason to btich about.</p>
<p>[br][size=1]Posted at: August 10, 2006, 05:11:51 PM[/size][hr]Actually one day he was trying to talk crap about use the box handler I had made, I posted it, I didnt care. I told him I diddnt care, and that I had his bot, so it was more a unequal stance or whatever in my favor. I knew he would assume I mean the public Aryan, but I alreayd knew before he told me that, as I already it (but didnt say that, just said Aryan and let him think what he wanted, knowing he would not be thikning about what I actually was saying.)</p>
<p>Also, If I had been given access, I would had never posted it. Even if there had been a falling out, but seeing as his only problem with me seemed to be the very reason it got posted in the first place, there wouldnt had been any problems anyway.</p>
<p>I cracked Aryanrune?? (dc3thugs bot) never released it, I also had the fagex bot source that was being made when everything got changed, I never gaive it out etc…</p>

        <p>Nerice had everything hehe. Why? because he is trusted.</p>
<p>The only thing i got before the release was snippits of the output from pd’s refactor.  I posted them in irc convs with the aryan devs and said their from old kait.  They never really caught on…</p>
<p>Buying the bot was a joke, i knew of its abilities. Nerice told me how borked it was.  Also regex was honest with its abilities he even told me i would most likely get scammed hehe.</p>

        <p>I had alot of stuff that noone ever knew I had. Everyone’s stuff except in one case, knew I had it though, at least pretty soon after words.</p>
<p>Like dc3thugs asked me the next day why I had cracked his bot, how I got the strings unecrypted etc… (Note string encryption never works… its a waste of time, as there has to be a way in the program to unencrypt them duh, just use the method/methods that does so and pass all the strings into it…) Using digits to convert to chars is a bit better to hide the strings, but even then, if you look at it hard enough, you realize what the purpose is, and still get the strings anyway.</p>
<p>Never released it, as cracking to post it was not the reason I did so, it was to practice getting around proctection stuff was all. I even cracked rulers stuff for the fun of it lol</p>
<p>Yes, the broken bot was borked, the good branch worked good though, adn teh updater spoke for itself once it got released.</p>

<p>I dont know if you were talking about me or not, I didnt think it was a secret bewtween us anyway, as I recall talking to eXemplar and pd about getting his updater also, but I think I did offer you the moparscape updater for pd’s renamer only because I wanted to see the code, I wouldnt have released it or anything as I told you. (come to think about it that would have been a horrible deal for you, that moparscape updater is pretty crappy :P)</p>

        <p>Yes Mopar, you was the one I was referring too. Wasnt going to say it was you that offered your updater for that one. In effect saying you knew…</p>
<p>Did I do it? lol</p>
<p>Doesnt prove one way or the other, no way for either side, but would tend to help show I wasnt looking to give it out, sell, trade etc…</p>

<p>It will be interesting since I am watching every single one of your posts, better be good now ;)[br][size=1]Posted at: August 11, 2006, 11:44:06 PM[/size][hr]Very strange, I have no idea what the hell happened, I went to look for this topic, and it was gone. So I was getting mad because I knew a mod or admin had deleted it, so I looked in the moderation log to find out that I had removed it <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedc164.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>In the past I have accidentaly clicked remove topic instead of delete posts, so I guess thats what happened, luckily I had a sql backup of right before that, so I grepped (is that a proper verb?) the .sql and restored this topic and all replies. Sorry if this has caused inconvenience for anyone, I have no idea how it happend <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tonguec164.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
