    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xerxess-ban/7991</link>
    <description>Now, most of you will prolly think im on some sort of drug for what im about to say, specialy cause its coming from me, but here goes...

Dont you think banning Xerxes was a tad bit harsh?


Was he just banned for his flamming and spamming, or was there more of a reason behind it?</description>

<p>It will be interesting since I am watching every single one of your posts, better be good now ;)[br][size=1]Posted at: August 11, 2006, 11:44:06 PM[/size][hr]Very strange, I have no idea what the hell happened, I went to look for this topic, and it was gone. So I was getting mad because I knew a mod or admin had deleted it, so I looked in the moderation log to find out that I had removed it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>In the past I have accidentaly clicked remove topic instead of delete posts, so I guess thats what happened, luckily I had a sql backup of right before that, so I grepped (is that a proper verb?) the .sql and restored this topic and all replies. Sorry if this has caused inconvenience for anyone, I have no idea how it happend <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>I dont know if you were talking about me or not, I didnt think it was a secret bewtween us anyway, as I recall talking to eXemplar and pd about getting his updater also, but I think I did offer you the moparscape updater for pd’s renamer only because I wanted to see the code, I wouldnt have released it or anything as I told you. (come to think about it that would have been a horrible deal for you, that moparscape updater is pretty crappy :P)</p>

<p>Never released it, as cracking to post it was not the reason I did so, it was to practice getting around proctection stuff was all. I even cracked rulers stuff for the fun of it lol</p>
<p>Yes, the broken bot was borked, the good branch worked good though, adn teh updater spoke for itself once it got released.</p>

<p>Buying the bot was a joke, i knew of its abilities. Nerice told me how borked it was.  Also regex was honest with its abilities he even told me i would most likely get scammed hehe.</p>

              <p>It wasnt freely given, and it wasnt stolen.</p>
<p>Explanation.</p>
<p>Even before Aryan went private, niether of us liked being dependant upon others. So we individually was working on rules and make our own updater. Not working together, but we talked at times.</p>
<p>Later on, he gave me a file, forget what it was now, but it was his work, not your guys, and it happened to have his password.</p>
<p>So he didnt realize he was giving it to me, and I never asked or went out of my way to try to get it. He was unlucky, I was lucky bassiclly.</p>
<p>I never offered to sell it, I never offered to trade it, I never gave it away except what you guys know I posted, and thats it.</p>
<p>I did look at the code, implemented some of the ideas into the private Aryan I used, but never even actually used that bot myself (I did use pd’s mapwalking classes though in mine). IMO, neither bot was better as a whole, While I used the public Aryan as a base to work off of, each of the private ones was better in some respects over the other one in the same area.</p>
<p>My interest was peaked about it before hand. The only time I ever asked about working on it with you guys, was I asked regex one time. He didnt like that I had become mod on autorune, and later on impsoft, so he said no. I had not asked, or been asked on either site, I logged in, and thats whne I knew I had been given mod access.</p>
<p>So it was all cool, but the day he went to talking shit, is the day the broken bot was posted. Even on autorune I had asked to be demodded, but they never would, at one time on impsoft I asked, and was removed. So when he was talking crap for no reason, I pretty much said screw you regex by posting the bot…</p>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>I will take shit for what I have done, but dont let people mess with me about something I have no control over or if able I will do something for them to have a reason to btich about.</p>
<p>[br][size=1]Posted at: August 10, 2006, 05:11:51 PM[/size][hr]Actually one day he was trying to talk crap about use the box handler I had made, I posted it, I didnt care. I told him I diddnt care, and that I had his bot, so it was more a unequal stance or whatever in my favor. I knew he would assume I mean the public Aryan, but I alreayd knew before he told me that, as I already it (but didnt say that, just said Aryan and let him think what he wanted, knowing he would not be thikning about what I actually was saying.)</p>
<p>Also, If I had been given access, I would had never posted it. Even if there had been a falling out, but seeing as his only problem with me seemed to be the very reason it got posted in the first place, there wouldnt had been any problems anyway.</p>
<p>I cracked Aryanrune?? (dc3thugs bot) never released it, I also had the fagex bot source that was being made when everything got changed, I never gaive it out etc…</p>

              <p>Think about it this way, I had it, I talked to ruler, he would had been the  likely to be the only one that woudl buy it. If I wanted to sell, and he wanted to buy, it could had been done with noone else ever knowing.</p>
<p>Up until litterally a few minutes before I posted the broken bot, 2? people was even aware I even had it, if I had been trying to sell it as as bad as whoever claims I was, am sure all of you guys would had heard about it before regex realized I had it (after I gave him a huge freaking hint…).</p>
<p>When pd, regex, and ruler was (i assume) messing with each ohter and playing around about buying and selling it, I could had just as easily asked ruler at that point if he was really serious…</p>
<p>Dont know who is sayign what, and what leads them to believe I really was, but they obviously got it wrong.</p>
<p>In fact…</p>
<p>Since the only 2 people I am aware of that knew I did have it are both CM’s here.</p>
<p>If the other one that wasnt ruler, that offered a trade for the updater, for something else would like to say what it was, and what my answer was.

<p>You were showboating around and trying to sell off an old aryan branch which you had backstabbed vreely (who trusted you, god knows why). Yeah it wasnt a big deal for you to use the password in the script to get a copy of the branch, but to then try and sell it? Retarded. Give it out for free? No big deal.</p>
<p>Those who attempt to profit via these methods are idiots who I have no respect for.</p>

ummm ya i offered free hosting, i didn’t ask for anything in return.  I stopped after RegeX got the free hosting and thru it go to the main acct and deleted files, released files, and other things.  I still offer it to trusted people and their are people that use it.</p>
<p>As for ripping you are a idiot.</p>

<p>Someone in irc one day said something to me, I asked if I would them under a different name. Was told they was regex, posts on autorune under the same name I knew was made by regex, the same username had posted a cracked sbot. Guess he was sharing the account if it wasnt him… as it was him, or he had to have been sharing the account.</p>
<p>Yeah, I said noone could be trusted around here, never said I was excluded.</p>
<p>As far as Mopar, its no a vendetta, its the truth. People that dont go to school deserve to fail as well.</p>
<p>As far as the updater, I knew it to be your code, I knew you had spent the the time finding and coming up with the names for alot of the classes/methods/variables, so thought it was all yours.</p>
<p>I totally agree with your last paragraph. Jagex gives a good challange to learn/overcome coding wise all the things they throw out to prevent cheating, only reason I even mess with RS at all…</p>
<p>Anyway, I am out of here for another month or two, will come back then to laugh at all some more.</p>

<p>Regarding the complaints about the “community,” I can’t help but giggle. For someone who would like to present themselves as less juvenile, and more rational, “well, I’m an untrustworthy bastard because everyone else is an untrustworthy bastard” is not much of a defense of oneself when amongst those older than eleven. Nor is “I hope you have problems, you deserve it” a statement that makes sense from someone who just implicitly referred to themselves as an “adult professional.” Childish vendettas surrounding internet drama are just that. And those participating in them do not get to come back in a month to reiterate them, and then say, “man, you people are soooo beneath me.” Trivial insults and then empty advice do not jive well in close proximity.</p>
<p>As for the rest:</p>
<p>I have no idea how I was hurt by anything.</p>
<p>When it became obvious that, via Vreely, Nerice had at least the dead branch of aryan, and it was either released or soon-to-be released, we went ahead and made public what we had. Development had long since died, no one but Vreely was using it, and there was simply no reason to keep it closed. No one cared any more. The way this has been phrased is as if it were some ultimate betrayal with the kidnapping of our child, and probably someone molesting our dog. Seriously, it’s a bot for Runescape. We didn’t give that much of a shit. Mainly, we were wondering how Nerice got ahold of it, and even that was obvious.</p>
<p>Though, for all of the “I wouldn’t have wanted to hurt pd,” you did release, with the bot, a library that I and only I had written, and the interface to it for the bot. Very simplistic Dijkstra pathfinding. I have no qualms with it being public (especially since there are a thousand better ones out there), but let’s not sit back and claim altruism when there blatantly is none.</p>
<p>Kamu made the call to release the updater. The syntax I had used for factor’s definitions was based on a much smaller updater that Kamu and joujoujou had, and Kamu gave me the tip about not needing to do anything but edit ConstantUTF8 entries. Kamu was the sole reason factor had the speed and clarity that it did; I just wrote enough code to put the pieces together and make it completely automated. And then the 80 gajillion rules it had.</p>
<p>It was Kamu’s brainchild, I just did the legwork. Which meant it was his decision, and he wanted it private. So it stayed private. The fact that it was a convoluted collection of individual tools that required you to at least sit down and read the shell script … well, that was a significant motivation, too, knowing the people who were going to try and use it if we made a public release. Nor did we want Jagex going out of their way to destroy my elegant little rules.</p>
<p>Everything I write is implicitly BSD licensed. Which means: do whatever the hell you want with this, but mention somewhere that you got it from me. Since I don’t actually expect most people to give credit where credit is due, everything I write is explicitly released into the public domain. Which means: do whatever the hell you want with this.</p>
<p>To conclude, the inane babble and infighting which can surround a group of adults, or soon-to-be adults, involved in cheating in a game designed for 12 year olds humours, amazes and frightens me to no end.</p>
