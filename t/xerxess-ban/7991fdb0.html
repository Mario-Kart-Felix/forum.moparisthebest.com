        <p>The entire RS cheating community is full of a bunch of whining, greedy, selfish assholes.</p>
<p>It has got what it deserves, nothing.</p>
<p>I very much like working with adult professionals alot more. Yeah, we have our disagreements too, but hey, everyone does. Its how its handled that makes a difference.</p>
<p>When Kaitnieks shut down, that was the end of any sort of semblance of any good cheating sites. Noone works together towards a common goal, look around for the general uses, what is there? Same thing there was before Kaitnieks shut down (or dependant on it).</p>
<p>The cheating scene is just like in RS itself, you cant trust a single person. Sure I leaked Regex’s broken bot after it went private,  I had it all for a good long time before I did. I did so because he had cracked/leaked Sbot, then wanted to talk shit about something he knew nothing about, nor that I had anything to do with. I didnt leak the updater because it was PD’s. Mopar, you know yourself I had it for a good long time and wouldn’t give it out.</p>
<p>I had hopes for this site for a while, but Mopar when I pm’ed you about some of Xerxes’'s shit, you didnt do anything, then when I did the same thing, you removed what I did and left his.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes I spammed on threads that I knew was going to be gone, and sometimes I made a smark remark to someone that couldnt read the post before his that answered his question.</p>
<p>Hope he comes back and continues to cause you problems. You deserve it.</p>
<p>So know I come back every now and then to laugh at everyone flaming each ohter in general, and flaming each others work instead of working together to actually get somewhre, while I sit back and enjoy a bot that dont screw up, and dont get banned very often.</p>
<p>All you decent coders should get behind the past, shut the fuck up about it, and work together to improve what you all have individually, so you can all collectively together, have a good bot. Of course you will flame me, keep doing what you do now, and be in the same place you are now and too stupid realize why.</p>

        <p>yes nerice didn’t give it out.  regex leaked pd refactor which was the most valuable piece.</p>
<p>yes xerxes was the root cause of me and nerice getting pissed at mopar.  The reason was xerxes calling me and nerice rippers and flamming in general.  Nerice started calling xerxes a ripper and all of nerices posts got deleted.  Xerxes posts remained untouch.  It took over 4 months to get to the point where action is taken against him.</p>
<p>I don’t have a problem with xerxes i have a problem with double standandards.</p>
<p>As for trust the only person in the community that i have been able to trust always is Nerice, GenoDemon, Freddy and Cruel.  I have trusted others but they backstab after they get what they want.  I use to trust Mopar until he or waffen change my signiture and profile picture.</p>

        <p>PD gave out his updater not regex, I assume once he realized I had it, to pre-empt me from leaking it, which I hadnt, nor would I had done. He didnt know though.</p>
<p>I had got into the svn months before, and he should had realized if I was going to leak it, I would had done so with the bot.</p>
<p>I dont too much care about the double standard Mopar has or at least had. He is paying for it now, and will continue to pay for it. When he wonders why Xerxes and others are so bad, all he needs to do is go look in the mirror to find out. Watching them have thier free for all, and Mopar having to deal with it is good enough for me to be satisfied. Thought about taking action, but they will do more to him then I ever could.</p>
<p>Rules thread might as well be deleted, unless in the last month when I hadnt checked back for sometime something has changed. From the few threads I have looked at, its all the same.</p>

        <p>My opinion on the updater subject:</p>
<p>Pd released the updater after everyone found out you had it because ruler was offering you money for it.  Ruler had already made a ton of money off of aryan, and I’m betting pd didn’t want you to make money off of his updater.</p>
<p>pd can speak for himself if he has a comment.</p>

        <p>Nah, I had no intentions of selling, or giving it away. I was just being a butthead to regex, while at the same time not really helping anyone by leaking the broken bot. It was fixable with work, yeah, but really…</p>
<p>If I had known it would cause pd to feel threatened or worried or whatever to the degree it did, I wouldnt had even done that.</p>
<p>I respect and think pretty highly of his work. I <em>think</em> he is young, one day he is going to be great coder for whatever company he goes to work by looking at what he achieves with no formal education/experience from what I see of it now. (If he goes into a programming career.)</p>

<p>past? I dont give two shits about the past, unless I dont qualify as a ‘good coder’ or wtvr the fuck ruler was talking about.</p>
<p>Trust people in cheating? Sure, ive trusted a few - dosent mean i trust everyone thou. I trust a couple, but im not so brazen as to state their names. Sure there are quite a few trustworthy people abourt, but I dont talk to them, I trust who I know well. and that is it.</p>

        <p>I’ll start with what didn’t address me:</p>
<p>I am not aware of Regex having leaked sbot at any point. I don’t know what he “didn’t know” yet was “talking shit about.” From him:</p>
<blockquote>2152.52       regex: I never had a working copy of sbot3 on my computer, apart from the trial that richyt organised at first
2153.44       regex: the last thing i remember publicly cracking was broken's rs2 bot
2153.47       regex: and that was so fucking long ago</blockquote>
<p>Regarding the complaints about the “community,” I can’t help but giggle. For someone who would like to present themselves as less juvenile, and more rational, “well, I’m an untrustworthy bastard because everyone else is an untrustworthy bastard” is not much of a defense of oneself when amongst those older than eleven. Nor is “I hope you have problems, you deserve it” a statement that makes sense from someone who just implicitly referred to themselves as an “adult professional.” Childish vendettas surrounding internet drama are just that. And those participating in them do not get to come back in a month to reiterate them, and then say, “man, you people are soooo beneath me.” Trivial insults and then empty advice do not jive well in close proximity.</p>
<p>As for the rest:</p>
<p>I have no idea how I was hurt by anything.</p>
<p>When it became obvious that, via Vreely, Nerice had at least the dead branch of aryan, and it was either released or soon-to-be released, we went ahead and made public what we had. Development had long since died, no one but Vreely was using it, and there was simply no reason to keep it closed. No one cared any more. The way this has been phrased is as if it were some ultimate betrayal with the kidnapping of our child, and probably someone molesting our dog. Seriously, it’s a bot for Runescape. We didn’t give that much of a shit. Mainly, we were wondering how Nerice got ahold of it, and even that was obvious.</p>
<p>Though, for all of the “I wouldn’t have wanted to hurt pd,” you did release, with the bot, a library that I and only I had written, and the interface to it for the bot. Very simplistic Dijkstra pathfinding. I have no qualms with it being public (especially since there are a thousand better ones out there), but let’s not sit back and claim altruism when there blatantly is none.</p>
<p>Kamu made the call to release the updater. The syntax I had used for factor’s definitions was based on a much smaller updater that Kamu and joujoujou had, and Kamu gave me the tip about not needing to do anything but edit ConstantUTF8 entries. Kamu was the sole reason factor had the speed and clarity that it did; I just wrote enough code to put the pieces together and make it completely automated. And then the 80 gajillion rules it had.</p>
<p>It was Kamu’s brainchild, I just did the legwork. Which meant it was his decision, and he wanted it private. So it stayed private. The fact that it was a convoluted collection of individual tools that required you to at least sit down and read the shell script … well, that was a significant motivation, too, knowing the people who were going to try and use it if we made a public release. Nor did we want Jagex going out of their way to destroy my elegant little rules.</p>
<p>Everything I write is implicitly BSD licensed. Which means: do whatever the hell you want with this, but mention somewhere that you got it from me. Since I don’t actually expect most people to give credit where credit is due, everything I write is explicitly released into the public domain. Which means: do whatever the hell you want with this.</p>
<p>To conclude, the inane babble and infighting which can surround a group of adults, or soon-to-be adults, involved in cheating in a game designed for 12 year olds humours, amazes and frightens me to no end.</p>

"</p>
<p>Someone in irc one day said something to me, I asked if I would them under a different name. Was told they was regex, posts on autorune under the same name I knew was made by regex, the same username had posted a cracked sbot. Guess he was sharing the account if it wasnt him… as it was him, or he had to have been sharing the account.</p>
<p>Yeah, I said noone could be trusted around here, never said I was excluded.</p>
<p>As far as Mopar, its no a vendetta, its the truth. People that dont go to school deserve to fail as well.</p>
<p>As far as the updater, I knew it to be your code, I knew you had spent the the time finding and coming up with the names for alot of the classes/methods/variables, so thought it was all yours.</p>
<p>I totally agree with your last paragraph. Jagex gives a good challange to learn/overcome coding wise all the things they throw out to prevent cheating, only reason I even mess with RS at all…</p>
<p>Anyway, I am out of here for another month or two, will come back then to laugh at all some more.</p>

ummm ya i offered free hosting, i didn’t ask for anything in return.  I stopped after RegeX got the free hosting and thru it go to the main acct and deleted files, released files, and other things.  I still offer it to trusted people and their are people that use it.</p>

<p>As for Freddy, he works with many parts of the community.</p>
<p>As for freeweed, i never charged him i even adveritsed his site for free.  I even got letters from jagex :).</p>
<p>As for you, what would you host?  I don’t know of stuff you have produced.</p>

<p>You were showboating around and trying to sell off an old aryan branch which you had backstabbed vreely (who trusted you, god knows why). Yeah it wasnt a big deal for you to use the password in the script to get a copy of the branch, but to then try and sell it? Retarded. Give it out for free? No big deal.</p>
<p>Those who attempt to profit via these methods are idiots who I have no respect for.</p>
