    <title>Which Fan/Heatsink is better?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-fan-heatsink-is-better/277668</link>
    <description>Ok, so I&quot;m trying to find the best fan/heatsink for my CPU. I&quot;m thinking of either the Thermaltake SpinQ or V1 Ax, or on of the Zalman ones, but I&quot;m not entireley sure which would be better. Which one would you guys suggest? Since you all would probably have your own suggestions.

I suppose the correct term I&#39;m looking for is which cooler should I get.</description>

<p>The standard fan and heatsink that comes with modern intel cpus are great and will keep your CPU plenty cool even with mild overclocking, if you are going to overclock hardcore or something (no need though) then there is really no reason to get anything else.</p>

              <p>As well as a beast of a fan with an effiecient heatskin you should also consider using proper thermal paste to maxismise heat transfer between the die of the cpu and the bottom of the heat skin. llib example is made by Arctic cooling so i guess it will come with artic silver 5 which imo is the best paste. You should also make sure that the thing will be pararell with the cpu or you’ll face many problems.</p>
<p>Years ago I was a bit stupid and scrapped a lot of thermal paste off my cpu and had several problems after.</p>
