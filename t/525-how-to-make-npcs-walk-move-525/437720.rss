    <description>Tested source/base: Mast3r Pkyz - codeusa - 525
Difficulty: about 2/10 - Got to have knowledge of finding the files in your server. And maybe a little copy and paste knowledge.


Ok so I&#39;m making this tutorial because I had a very hard time finding a legit tutorial on making 525 npcs walk. I searched Google for days and came up with nothing. So finally I requested help here on moparscape and got my answers. Turns out it was easy.


First off you need to know the npc you want to spawn, simply get its id, and then open...
npclist.cfg - should be located at data/npcs

Here is an example on how to setup your npc.
[code]npc	=	1265	13	35	9	0	0	0	30	0	Rock_crab_mid	A_medium_sized_crab_living_in_a_rock.
[ENDOFNPCLIST]
//Format: id, cb lvl, hp, max hit, atk, die, def, spawnt, npc size, name, examine[/code]

Hit save and close after your done setting up your npc, then open...
npcspawn.cfg - should be located at data/npcs
Now you have to get the npcs spawn coords, height, ect.

Here is an example on how to setup your npc.
[code]spawn	=	1265	2102	3849	-8	0	2104	3851	2100	3848	Rock CrabM
[ENDOFSPAWNLIST]
//Format: id, xcord, ycord, direction, height, (max)ne xcord, (max)ne ycord, (min)sw xcord, (min)sw ycord, name
-9 = ne, -8 = e, -7 = sw, -6 = nw, -5 = se[/code]

Notice the 2 sets of coords at the end of the example, near the npc name.
Your ne coords and sw coords may have to be switch around. Depending on your 525 source. (this is important) Now save and close after your done setting up your npc.

Ok now that your npc is spawned and ready to start moving, open NPCMovement.java - should be located at src/net/com/codeusa/npcs/update (If your using a different source, try finding the file as best you can)

Once open, click ctr-f and search for...
[code]int getRandomWalking(NPC n) {[/code]

Under that you should see...
[code]	switch (n.npcType) {

		case 6729:
		case 1265:
			return 2;

		case 6998:
		case 6999:
			return 1;
	}
	return 7;
    }[/code]

Now just add your npc id(s) under case 6729: or above return2; if you don&#39;t have case 6729:
Save, close, compile, enjoy!
