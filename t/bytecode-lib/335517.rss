    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bytecode-lib/335517</link>
    <description>Hmm, a while back I was working on a bytecode library, and I&#39;m going to resume working on it, but I&#39;m thinking of redoing it because I want to implement some features and such I didn&#39;t consider at first. However, I have 1 question...

The library will be used in a scripting environment by people, would it be best to give them direct access to the constant pool like BCEL or keep all data related to certain object with the object like ASM? I was thinking of doing the latter by reading the java files and adding all of the read data to their respective objects, and when saving building a new constantpool, I&#39;d also add methods like hasLDC or something so any need of having access to the constantpool would be averted...</description>

Yeah, FPC was in pretty bad shape, but it has improved a lot, though I wouldn’t quite use it actively yet, it’s getting there. Though I don’t see companies like DevExpress and such supporting it any time soon…</p>
<p>And yeah, Borland was pretty horrible, though Embarcadero is certainly equally ambitious, but their approach to everything is a lot better. Borland always tried to do too much at once in too little time with too little people, Embarcadero gradually takes on problems and makes new things so everything goes a lot more smoothly and they don’t end up with half-assed products. They also realized it was pretty stupid for Borland to try to compete with Microsoft with <a href="http://Delphi.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">Delphi.NET</a>, which was a half-assed cross-breed between Delphi and .NET, they tried to make it as much like the native Delphi as they could, which was a huge mistake and lead to the fact that rly no one used it. Embarcadero has since Delphi 2009 dropped the product and moved on to Delphi Prism, which is a .NET implementation of pascal, but not compatible with Delphi like Borland tried with <a href="http://Delphi.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">Delphi.NET</a>. Also Prism integrates in Visual studio rather than to be integrated into the Delphi IDE like <a href="http://Delphi.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">Delphi.NET</a> was. Which I think is pretty great, since the Delphi IDE was never intended for a .NET language… Prism is powered by the RemObjects Oxygene compiler technology, which is pretty great, it cares somewhat less about being conform with normal pascal syntax to ensure that it doesn’t hold back on language features. Though my license includes it, I don’t use Prism myself, the nice thing is that it does allow you to use Mono, so you can do cross-platform development with it, if you like Pascal/Delphi and .NET, it’s nice to check out. <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi-prism" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi-prism</a></p>

True, open-source does have a lot of advantages… And Delphi certainly has plenty of cons, I won’t argue there, when Embarcadero took over from Borland, they had a lot of damage to fix, by the time Delphi reached version 2007 it had become entirely unstable. There’s still a long way to go before it’s perfect, but they’re getting there…</p>
<p>Well, Lazarus (FPC) is an open-source alternative to Delphi, it’s not all that good though unfortunately, it still needs loads of work, but on the other side, more and more component developers for Delphi are starting to support the platform…</p>
<p>One plus side to Delphi that I think is pretty nice is that Embarcadero is very close to the community, they listen to the needs of their users, trough their community, surveys, etc… They also work very closely with component developers to both make sure that the components are up-to-date with the latest changes to the language and to get good ideas on how to improve the language further. Not the same as open-source, but I think it does help a lot…</p>
<p><span class="mention">@topic</span>, true, this may be the wrong forum, but I just wanted an opinion on how I should structure my library, nothing more, I figured that people in here would have better knowledge about the topic.</p>

Tbh, I still don’t quite get it, you mean that Delphi has a bloated framework? The visual component library is often regarded as rather bloated, if you want to create a small executable file in Delphi, you’re gonna have to go trough a lot of effort, I agree there totally, but I was referring to .NET mainly, the .NET framework, though allowing very fast and easy development, which is great, isn’t all that optimized for performance as you could optimize “unsafe code”, which you can use in .NET, but then you have to go mess with unsafe modes and stuff…</p>
<p>And I don’t speak of how Delphi is going to fix these problems, yes x64 and cross-platform support is not yet available, and will be soon, but thats it, all other features I’ve mentioned are available in Delphi today…</p>

<p>Delphi is quite expensive for non-commercial developers, that’s a fact, but they’re playing with the idea to release Personal versions which are going to be either free or really low-cost, to reach out to hobbyists and such.</p>
<p>And true, I use Delphi because it’s what I know best, but I also know loads about other languages, some very well and though there’s things I like about them that I miss in Delphi, I wouldn’t consider switching, though I agree that some projects are better left to other languages that better fit the profile of the project. But I feel Delphi shouldn’t be just dismissed because for some reason people have a bad image of it, people are still stuck with the image of an old outdated crappy language, while it has developed over the years, with Embarcadero taking over from Borland, the development has sped up a lot, Embarcadero is investing a lot of manpower and money towards improving the product more and more.</p>
<p>And, native language? .NET languages, java, they’re not native at all… They use JIT, they don’t compile into machine code directly…[/quote]I was pointing out the fact that Inc(var, 5) is retarded.</p>

i wish there was a free language implementation that had interfaces, generics and nothing else<br>
[/quote]<br>
Also, Delphi and C/C++ are some of the very few remaining decent native programming languages that don’t use a bloated framework that everyone has to have installed on their pc for it to actually work…[/quote]I’m trying to say, that a native language that has a bloated “framework”…isn’t a native language.</p>

<p>Delphi is quite expensive for non-commercial developers, that’s a fact, but they’re playing with the idea to release Personal versions which are going to be either free or really low-cost, to reach out to hobbyists and such.</p>
<p>And true, I use Delphi because it’s what I know best, but I also know loads about other languages, some very well and though there’s things I like about them that I miss in Delphi, I wouldn’t consider switching, though I agree that some projects are better left to other languages that better fit the profile of the project. But I feel Delphi shouldn’t be just dismissed because for some reason people have a bad image of it, people are still stuck with the image of an old outdated crappy language, while it has developed over the years, with Embarcadero taking over from Borland, the development has sped up a lot, Embarcadero is investing a lot of manpower and money towards improving the product more and more.</p>
<p>And, native language? .NET languages, java, they’re not native at all… They use JIT, they don’t compile into machine code directly…</p>

<p>Delphi is not the worst language, but the financial factor is a huge hit, not to mention there are so many free alternatives that are better.</p>
<p>Freddy, you can argue it all you like, but the fact is the reason you like Delphi is because its the language you know best.  I guarantee if you bothered to explore another language as much as you have Delphi, you would probably prefer it.</p>
<p>Regardless, onto another subject, Visual Studio has Express editions that are FREE.  Not to mention, Visual Studio is not the only program that is good at developing for its respective languages.</p>
<p>Next on the list, a “bloated framework” for a <span class="bbcode-b">native</span> language?  Care to explain this one to me, other than JIT?</p>
<p>Your reactions to Yakman and c|p’s posts was completely immature, and did not show that you are knowledgeable in the subject, instead it showed you act like a 5 year old child.  Grow the fuck up.</p>
<p>In closing, you suck o.0</p>

I wrote a topic about Delphi at <a href="http://cruels.net" rel="nofollow noopener">cruels.net</a> a while back about the modern day Delphi and why it’s a good choice as a programming language. Here’s some of the features I listed:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Language features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive backwards compatibility</li>
<li>Pointers</li>
<li>Inline ASM</li>

<li>Anonymous methods</li>
<li>Deprecated directive (with comment support)</li>
<li>Exit with a value (similar to return in c++)</li>
<li>Overloading</li>
<li>Abstract classes/class members</li>
<li>ToString, Equals, UnitName in objects</li>
<li>Operator overloading</li>
<li>StringBuilder, Readers/Writers, Streams</li>
<li>Advanced error handling</li>
<li>Included Indy library with components for loads of connection protocols with SSL support</li>
<li>ActiveX controls</li>
<li>OLE automation</li>
<li>Linking object files from C++ builder to compile C++ code into Delphi projects to wrap C++ libraries</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">IDE features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactoring</li>
<li>Code folding with regions</li>
<li>Code hints</li>
<li>Code completion</li>
<li>Block completion</li>
<li>Database viewers</li>
<li>Fast search bar rather than dialog with regex support</li>
<li>Searching in project/open files/one or more directories with regex support</li>
<li>Debugging capabilities for individual threads</li>
<li>IDE Insight (Quick access to anything in the IDE)</li>
<li>Open tools API (Allows you to modify the IDE and it’s features)</li>
<li>Block editing (SyncEdit)</li>
<li>Class explorer</li>
<li>Modeling tools</li>
<li>Debugging tools (breakpoints, watches, cpu views, memory views, stacktraces, disassembly view, …)</li>
<li>Live templates</li>
<li>History (basic local version control system)</li>
<li>Visual development with DFM linking (forms are stored in a DFM file instead of code being generated for them)</li>
<li>Line change indicators</li>
<li>Test unit support (DUnit)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view visual representations of a few of the IDE features here, the article is quite old though, it doesn’t show loads of newer features: <a href="http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/34323" rel="nofollow noopener">http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/34323</a></p>
<p>There’s loads of stuff I fail to mention of course. Only thing I miss are lambda expressions…</p>

Read what I wrote, Visual Studio is a lot more expensive and components are just as well sold for other languages as for Delphi, it’s exactly the same… Delphi isn’t pascal, it’s it’s own language just based on Pascal, any additions made like generics are as optimized as they are in any other language.</p>
