True, open-source does have a lot of advantages… And Delphi certainly has plenty of cons, I won’t argue there, when Embarcadero took over from Borland, they had a lot of damage to fix, by the time Delphi reached version 2007 it had become entirely unstable. There’s still a long way to go before it’s perfect, but they’re getting there…</p>
<p>Well, Lazarus (FPC) is an open-source alternative to Delphi, it’s not all that good though unfortunately, it still needs loads of work, but on the other side, more and more component developers for Delphi are starting to support the platform…</p>
<p>One plus side to Delphi that I think is pretty nice is that Embarcadero is very close to the community, they listen to the needs of their users, trough their community, surveys, etc… They also work very closely with component developers to both make sure that the components are up-to-date with the latest changes to the language and to get good ideas on how to improve the language further. Not the same as open-source, but I think it does help a lot…</p>
<p><span class="mention">@topic</span>, true, this may be the wrong forum, but I just wanted an opinion on how I should structure my library, nothing more, I figured that people in here would have better knowledge about the topic.</p>

        <p>I have looked at FPC, but it’s been a few years ago and I remember then it was in really bad condition.

Yeah, FPC was in pretty bad shape, but it has improved a lot, though I wouldn’t quite use it actively yet, it’s getting there. Though I don’t see companies like DevExpress and such supporting it any time soon…</p>
<p>And yeah, Borland was pretty horrible, though Embarcadero is certainly equally ambitious, but their approach to everything is a lot better. Borland always tried to do too much at once in too little time with too little people, Embarcadero gradually takes on problems and makes new things so everything goes a lot more smoothly and they don’t end up with half-assed products. They also realized it was pretty stupid for Borland to try to compete with Microsoft with <a href="http://delphi.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">Delphi.NET</a>, which was a half-assed cross-breed between Delphi and .NET, they tried to make it as much like the native Delphi as they could, which was a huge mistake and lead to the fact that rly no one used it. Embarcadero has since Delphi 2009 dropped the product and moved on to Delphi Prism, which is a .NET implementation of pascal, but not compatible with Delphi like Borland tried with <a href="http://delphi.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">Delphi.NET</a>. Also Prism integrates in Visual studio rather than to be integrated into the Delphi IDE like <a href="http://delphi.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">Delphi.NET</a> was. Which I think is pretty great, since the Delphi IDE was never intended for a .NET language… Prism is powered by the RemObjects Oxygene compiler technology, which is pretty great, it cares somewhat less about being conform with normal pascal syntax to ensure that it doesn’t hold back on language features. Though my license includes it, I don’t use Prism myself, the nice thing is that it does allow you to use Mono, so you can do cross-platform development with it, if you like Pascal/Delphi and .NET, it’s nice to check out. <a href="http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi-prism" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi-prism</a></p>

        <p>My point is once again proven that it’s obviously not possible for some members here to behave correctly and as such ruin every topic. So I’m going to close this, because aside that I got what I needed, there’s no way this topic is ever going back on-topic, and for the sake of some people it might be better because it seems to somehow encourage them to break rules, and I suppose they should be protected from themselves.</p>
