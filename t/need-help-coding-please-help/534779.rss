    <description>I downloaded a blank client and server because i wanted to make the server how i want it, but i have run across a big issue, I am unable to eat any food that i spawn in to heal me.  Some of the food just says nothing interesting happens and some of them say nothing i just click it and just sits there.  I have looked for snippets and other tutorials on how to add this and i have no been able to find one.  If you could please help me i would really appreciate it.

Skype:GrayishSidewayz1  Message me on here.
Thanks.</description>

              <p>Alternatively, you can just go c&amp;p one of the dozens of released eating systems and modifying it slightly so it works with your source (renaming mostly).</p>

              <p>Dude. You downloaded a blank source. Of course eating isn’t added. It’s blank.</p>
<p>So you need to add eating in.</p>
<p>Can’t really help much seeing as you gave 0 info about your source.</p>
