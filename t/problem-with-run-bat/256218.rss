              <p>I didn’t leech it I got it from someone who hates Delta as much as I do. I just decompiled it and it was over 3 months old if I had msn installed I don’t because I got reported for viruses I would show the chat logs. Delta dosent care if I release it. Acutally he might because it has character files but other than that no. I’m not helping you with your problem since you think I leeched. Also why would you pm a leecher saying ‘Izzy help me’?</p>
