    <title>Attack Clipping</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/attack-clipping/422348</link>
    <description>I have npc clipping and player following clipping, but I can&#39;t find out how to clip players when they attack npc&#39;s/other players. They can run through objects and whatnot. If anyone has a fix for this, please show me. I can&#39;t find any tutorials on this.</description>

<p>Bresenham's line algorithm is an algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, subtraction and bit shifting, all of which are very cheap operations in standard computer architectures. It is an incremental error algorithm. It is one of the earliest algorith...</p>
