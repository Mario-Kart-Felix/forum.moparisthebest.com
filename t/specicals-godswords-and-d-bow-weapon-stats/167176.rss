    <title>Specicals, GodSwords and D-Bow!Weapon Stats + -</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/specicals-godswords-and-d-bow-weapon-stats/167176</link>
    <description>Ok I want to be able to have specials in my server.  Like in real rs the dds, whip, god swords etc. specails.  How would I do that?  Is there a tut?

How do you change the stat effects of a weapon?  Like the whip gives u, i think, 300+ Str bonus and how would i edit it so its like 600?  And how would i change the stats for a weapon that gives 0+ everything like a sythe.  Is there a tut for this too?

And how do i make the d-bow shoot arrows instead of hitting someone?  Is there a tut for this also?

If anyone can give me the codes for this I would really appericate that

Thanks!!!!</description>
