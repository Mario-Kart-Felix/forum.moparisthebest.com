    <description>192.210.228.119 is the ip So come alone and join us
The server is a surival pvp
Pixelmon 1.6.2 server!
With great community and staff
aswell as events from time to time and a huge tournament! Gyms

Our Gyms are all level 60 cap to prevent &quot;Where is the first Gym&quot; mentality where over 9000 players are all in line waiting for Pewter City Gym leader to battle them while all the other gym leaders stand idly by.

On our server you can battle gyms in any order, but you also must be serious enough to have your team at least level 60 before bothering the gym leaders. This is to prevent long lines and crowding at gyms and to make sure only the strongest players make their way through the Pokemon League.
We do need staff and gym leaders to so come
and join and become staff or a gym leader
