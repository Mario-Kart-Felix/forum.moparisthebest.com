    <title>Server Errors and Global Objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-errors-and-global-objects/70679</link>
    <description>Shortly after reading -fedexers- guide on global objects I started my server to see if it my ability to follow directions was a success, And as far as I thought, it was. I had 2 perfectly placed portals. Unfortunately my happiness was sucked away as soon as I recieved the Connection Lost - Attempting to re-establish message. At first I thought this was O.K. I mean, it happens to everyone once and a while, But second after second it did it again, And I noticed this message appearing over and over again in the console window.

[code]
Starting [xL] Scape Server.
ClientHandler: Accepted from localhost:2086
Ghost is signing onto server.
Ghost: character file not found.
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 15745
        at client.parseIncomingPackets(client.java:16504)
        at client.packetProcess(client.java:15309)
        at client.process(client.java:15279)
        at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.java:137)
        at server.main(server.java:50)
[xL] Scape [FATAL] - exception
Could not save for Ghost
ClientHandler: Client Ghost disconnected.
[/code]

Frantically. I decided to go back into my client.java and delete anything to do with those damned Global Objects. I compiled and restarted my server. Again with my misfortune I wasnt awarded for my efforts, the problem was still occuring !

Long story short: What can I do to stop this ?

Edit - Im wondering if my question is ever going to be answered? . It always seems like you have the people that help others do things that are the easiest, then when the come upon a message like mine, they decide to back away until another person asks &#39;how i mke rs servr plx&#39; then they jump right on the case. I just hope this time my question isnt flooded out by useless questions again.</description>

              <p>That doesnt make any sense. I’ve deleted the character, and i’ve made new ones as well. It has something to do with the Global Objects… I just dont know what.</p>
<p>Edit - Just to entertain you i’ve copied the console when I tried to connect with a NEW character.</p>
