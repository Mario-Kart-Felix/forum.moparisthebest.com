    <title>Cache Downloading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-downloading/418398</link>
    <description>Hey Everyone, Basically my cache downloads but downloads wrong it downloads it like this.

All the cache files download in the zip file contained in the cache and the main cache files are 0kb but if you open up the zip folder contained in the cache has all the files so people have to extract it which would be too hard for some people as they can be lazy and just quit.

This is how I uploaded it on Dropbox and I did do add to archive before people ask.

That is how I uploaded the files on dropbox basically a zipped archive containing the files.

I don&#39;t know what the problem is.

Please Help.

Thanks, I Rushed You</description>
