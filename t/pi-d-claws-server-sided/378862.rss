    <description>I added d claws client sided using this guide This tutorial will show you how to add Dragon Claws into your Project Insanity client. It&#39;s really easy. Credits to Galkon for the 474 look alike client.

First, download the models, you can find them here.

After downloading that, make a folder in your client, and name it Raw(If you already have this, then just skip this part)

Extract the models, and put them into your Raw folder, now open up ItemDef.java, and search 
Code:
/* Hardcoded items start here */Right under that, add this int

Code:
if(i == 11740) {
                itemDef.actions = new String[5];
                itemDef.actions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
                itemDef.modelID = 44590;
                itemDef.maleEquip1 = 43660;//anInt165
                itemDef.femaleEquip1 = 43660;//anInt200
                itemDef.modelZoom = 789;
                itemDef.modelRotation1 = 240;
                itemDef.modelRotation2 = 60;
                itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
                itemDef.modelOffset2 = -23;
                itemDef.name = &quot;Dragon claws&quot;;
                itemDef.description = &quot;A set of fighting claws.&quot;.getBytes();
                }After adding that int, it should now look like this


Code:
/* Hardcoded items start here */
		/**/
		if(i == 11740) {
                itemDef.actions = new String[5];
                itemDef.actions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
                itemDef.modelID = 44590;
                itemDef.maleEquip1 = 43660;//anInt165
                itemDef.femaleEquip1 = 43660;//anInt200
                itemDef.modelZoom = 789;
                itemDef.modelRotation1 = 240;
                itemDef.modelRotation2 = 60;
                itemDef.modelOffset1 = -1;
                itemDef.modelOffset2 = -23;
                itemDef.name = &quot;Dragon claws&quot;;
                itemDef.description = &quot;A set of fighting claws.&quot;.getBytes();
            }
		return itemDef;
	}Save and Compile, and there you go. Now load up your client, and ingame type in add model, something should pop up asking you the model number, in there type 43660, then do it again, this time type 44590

And i got hem server sided in combat assistant and stuff and bthey still inviseble and they go in helmet slot when i wear them,
