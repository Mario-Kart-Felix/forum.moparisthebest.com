    <description>please i have this client were i changed changed almost everything for it but i need help with 4 things:
1. i need help taking the vote/ forums button off the client and in game click.
2.i need help changing the title of the rsps 317 client name. i tryed right clicking on run under the client and chaging that name but nothing, only the cmd changed not the actual client.
3. i need help fixing my mute/ban notes on my source. because i put a name into the ban or muted notepad then save it and i try logging in to see if it has been muted etc... and it allowed to do anything it did before.
