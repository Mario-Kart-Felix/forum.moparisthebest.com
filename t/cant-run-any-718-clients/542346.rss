    <title>Cant run any 718 clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-run-any-718-clients/542346</link>
    <description>Anytime i download a 718 client i always get a threat pop up and for some reason AVG thinks that Class52_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1.class ia a virus. Any help would be great, thank you.

Also for some reason when i downloaded this client (http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs-503-client-server/downloads/448758-718-client-run-compiler-no-errors.html)
it also tells me i don&#39;t have permission to copy the Class52_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1.class file which is weird.

Thanks again.

FIXED IT THANK YOU

turns out i just needed to turn off my antivirus while extracting and it works fine now.</description>
