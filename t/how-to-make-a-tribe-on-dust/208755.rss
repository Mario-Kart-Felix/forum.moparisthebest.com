If you don&#39;t know what dust is go [URL=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,275089.0.html]here[/URL] and see the topic posted by our games moderator.
Firstly you need to build the land they walk on so do as i have done in this image
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust1.png[/img]
That is done by laying down some water in the left and then quickly laying down powder(and lots of it) on the right. Now we have the basic land lets make a jungle
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust2.png[/img]
Only lay the seeds down in small quantites otherwise they just build up on top of each other, to enhance growth add a sprinkling of water. now we add some tribes people
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust3.png[/img]
They will happily jump around and do whatever the hell they like, they don&#39;t like water too much they sorta jump in and jump out. Now to add some ambience to the scene with a fan in the top left corner
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust4.png[/img]
If you have the wind facing into the corner it is less destructive to your island, if however you are an evil sadastic person put it a hell of a lot closer and watch your men fly away
This is with the wind facing the island
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust5.png[/img]
Now i am going to make some glaciers in the left water deposit
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust6.png[/img]
As you can see the little men are fulmmexed by this icey rock i have removed the wind so that it doesn&#39;t damage the island in this tutorial.
Now to make an atmosphere for the midgets, so they have something up in the sky.
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust7.png[/img]
I&#39;ve just put a load of gas in there and then in centre i put a blast of air to spread it evenly outwards
Now to add a water wheel for fun and decoration, just place it in the water and use the drag tool to spin it
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust8.png[/img]
Now lets say we are bored of our midgets and we want to give them a party before we poison them, simple melt the glacier and replace it with a fire pit full of magma.
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust9.png[/img]
Next ram in some fireworks and let them make a nice show
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust10.png[/img]
now cover the whole thing in virus,C4 and fire and have fun watching them die
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust11.png[/img]
Light the gas on fire
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust12.png[/img]
Finally make a huge fan in the middle and put Gas,Magma and fighters in the mix and watch them get torn apart repeatedly
[IMG]http://i161.photobucket.com/albums/t231/sanga282/Dust13.png[/img]
You have now built a tribe and successfully destroyed it :D</description>
