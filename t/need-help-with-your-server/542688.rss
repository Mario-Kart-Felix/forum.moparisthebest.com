              <p>There are tons of people looking for help in the very section you’re posting this topic in, who woulda guessed?! People generally come here to post their problems so it wouldn’t make sense having a topic where people post their problems for you to reply, that’s some sort of ‘server helpseption.’ But we really do appreciate your help and consideration to aid the community.</p>
<p>If you’re having a bit of trouble understanding the rules or just have questions about them, you can message me. The section rules are posted <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,661564.msg4421952.html#msg4421952" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">above by sk8rdude461 as well as the Global rules</a> that apply to the whole forum.</p>

              <p>This isn’t how the help section works. I say that because I could almost guarantee your “help” would be them paying you to do it.</p>
<p>Everything you listed can be done via tutorial.</p>
<p>And fixing that “100 error problem” all you need is an IDE.</p>
<p>You should take a look at the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,331370.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Section Rules</a> along with the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354311.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Global rules</a> before posting.</p>
