    <title>Help with getting the Server running. (Sorry)</title>

    <description>Hey guys, after following the various guides for setting up a Private server with Moparscape 3.2, I have got the Client and also a server named TestScape Source.

My Compiler is formatted as follows:

@echo off
title Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_13\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
pause

And Runserver as follows:

@echo off
title Runserver
set java=&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_13\bin\java.exe&quot;
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server
pause


I am using SDK 6 update 13. The problem that is occuring is that once running Compile, the follow message displays:
&quot;Note: stream.java uses or overrides a depreciated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:depreciation for details.
Press any key to continue  .  .  .&quot;


Another issue is when running Runserver, the following appears:

&#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program of batch file.
Press any key to continue...

Can someone please help me? Would love to get this server running ^.^</description>
