    <description>[size=6pt][u]DISCLAIMER [Davidi2] - Don&#39;t listen if you find semi-racist humor to be offensive[/u][/size]


http://dl.dropbox.com/u/934145/Musix/BAN.mp3

Largely unfinished because i was interrupted, and the solo was improvised and never finished, and therefore is horrible.

What I do think however is that your projecting your own feelings about being a racist yourself. You also apparently do not know the definition of a racist.</p>
