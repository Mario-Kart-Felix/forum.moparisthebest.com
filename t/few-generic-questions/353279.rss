    <description> *using a 317 server, non delta**I don&#39;t have clickingMost.java!**I don&#39;t have actionButtons.java!*

How do I get it so that when buying from a shop, the maximum I can buy is 50, and not just 10?

How do I get it so that when I trade a npc with a shop, It shows the items? At the moment, I can only buy items from him when I &#39;talk&#39; to him.

How do I set it so that &#39;follow&#39; works when right clicking on other players?

How do I get it so that when using a command such as ::home, it does the animation for teleport, brings me to the coordinates, than finishes the animation for teleport? At the momment, If I do ::home, this teleports my player to the coordinates, then does the animation, but only the beginning, and when my player shrinks to a tiny person. It freezes.

How do I get it so let&#39;s say a &#39;tree&#39; object, will never be cut down, and you can continue to cut from it forever without worrying about switching trees?

Finally, how do I make it so that a stationary NPC like a banker, can face in any direction that I want. At the moment, they all face south.

Thanks guys.</description>

<p>open up your source folder and search for shops.cfg<br>
look for name of shop, and the item i.d should be first, followed up by the amount the npc sells of it[/quote]</p>
<p>I understand that, like I set it so there is a 100 of one item, what i’m wondering is how when you walk into the shop you can buy like 50 runs for your self, instead of buying 10 at a time.</p>
