    <description>Hello,

I don&#39;t really know how I should title this thread but ohwell.

I&#39;ve recently had this idea (Belgium only but that doesn&#39;t mean that i can&#39;t share it with you guys) about a website where people could see Events/Parties (more information below)
I decided to share the progress with you guys as this is about web development and i feel the need to post more on mopar. (Sorry for the lurking)

[u][b]The idea[/b][/u]
Creating a website that will show all parties/music events in Belgium based on your personal info and what not.

[b]But AmmoBandit, you have Facebook and other sites for that stuff, why creat one your own?[/b]
Well, i know that there are a few sites out there that do this. But they are not doing it the way i think it should be done + most of the sites are just ugly in my opinion.
About Facebook; I know that you can create events on FB, invite friends and share it but i find that owners/hosts of a event don&#39;t have alot of freedom this is why we (me and a friend) are doing it different. I&#39;m also aware of the amout of users on FB and that my project can go down the sink but this will also be great for learning.

[u][b]How does it work?[/b][/u]
How will the system work do you ask, here are a few points:

[b]Guests/User/Organisers[/b]

[ul][li]Guests will be able to create a account, if the wish to do not then the homepage will not be customized to their genres/location[/li]
[li]All users will have the option to select what music genre they love, what province they live in, and they will be able to fill in their age[/li]
[li]The option to integrate Facebook will also be possible, this will make it easier to verify the age of users, pull their location date and what music they are into.[/li]
[list]
[li]The Facebook integration will also make it possible to add friends/invite them, post and share an event[/li]
[/list]
[li]Users will be able to upgrade their account to Organiser (They need to be able to show that they host a Event/Party in order for us to promote their account)[/li][/ul]

[b]Organisers[/b]

[ul][li]Organisers will have their own Organiser Page; this will display all their events + contact detail and what not. The thing will be easy to customize[/li]
[li]Organisers will be able to add Events and Promote these event (read more further)[/li][/ul]

[b]The Home Page[/b]
The homepage will be customized to your prefferences and this is how it works:

[ul][li]Only the music genres that the user selected will be shown on the page (these can be edited whenever they feel like)[/li]
[li]Secondly, The page will first load the Parties/Events that are near you and wich the date is the closest. The amount of friends that will attend will also affect this order.[/li]
[li]There will also be a Sponsored Event/Party, this will show up on the top of selected music genre(s). If more are Events are beeing sponsored at the same time then there will a rotation system (proberbly)[/li]
[li]A Search Bar will also be provided just to make sure[/li][/ul]

[b]The &quot;My Feed&quot; Tab[/b]
The &quot;My Feed&quot; Tab will sorta be your social hub what i mean by this is

[ul][li]You will be able to see where your friends are going and you&#39;ll be able to instantly join them[/li]
[li]Suggested Evenst by friends will be shown there[/li]
[li]Organisers that uploaded pictures of the Event/Party/Festival you went to will be shown on that page (not all ofcourse but you&#39;ll be able to see the full album if you click the link or whatever)[/li]
[li]More soon when i get feedback, think about something[/li][/ul]

[b]There will proberbly be a Calendar Tab, just to make sure[/b]

[b]Event Pages[/b]

[ul][li]Event pages will have a customizable top Banner (you&#39;ll see the design below when I finished it, I find it gorgious)[/li]
[li]Users will be able to rate the event afterwards (might reconsider this idea) If this gets implimented then the rating system will only become available when the event has ended to make sure no false ratings are given[/li]
[li]Organisers will be able to promote the event like mentioned before[/li]
[li]Organisers will be able to edit the full page (design will be shown when this is finished)[/li]
[li]Users will be able to invite friends to the event, share it on the &quot;Feed&quot; Tab[/li]
[li]If FB is linked with the account then they will be able to share this through FB aswell[/li][/ul]


More coming soon, This list is not final and changes can and will proberbly be made.

<p>This is all going to be useless without a strong back-end algorithm, have you any idea how it is going to ‘predict’ what events users will want to go to using their music taste?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As i said, users will need to select their music genres they listen to (check them off in their setting). Event hosts will also have to check what genres will be played at their events, parties or what ever. Only the genres that the users selected will be showing up on the home page; e.g Hardstyle.</p>
<p>After that the parties/events where your friends are going to will show up in the genre category, then the nearest location to your city. The date will also push them above the list so that you wont end up seeing events that are in abouth a month when there is one available next week.</p>
<p>We’re still working on the algorithm but it will work out.</p>
<p>This is also just one huge learning project for us but i like the reply <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
