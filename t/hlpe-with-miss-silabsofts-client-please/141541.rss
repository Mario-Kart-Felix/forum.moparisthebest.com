    <title>Hlpe with Miss Silabsoft&#39;s Client please</title>

    <description>This question has not been asked yet, so I decided to post it.

When I try to use Miss Silabsoft&#39;s client, I get this:

What I&#39;ve tried:

I&#39;ve tried so many thing&#39;s, that some of them probably will not be listed.

Downloaded JDK 6u1 Online
Downloaded JDK 6u1 Offline
Downloaded JDK 6u2 Online
Downloaded JDK 6u2 Offline
Checked for JDK folder... wasn&#39;t there
Re-Downloaded above and the client multiple times.
Prayed to God
Manually directed path
There&#39;s probably more...

I&#39;d give reputation, but I don&#39;t know how.... If you want to help me for &quot;rep&quot; or something else, than I can&#39;t help you. I just need someone who knows what to do to FINALLY help me. I&#39;ve been trying to fix this error since the client came out.</description>
