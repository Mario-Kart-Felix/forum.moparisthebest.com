    <title>New ideas for a better bot?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-ideas-for-a-better-bot/2695</link>
    <description>i posted this on theintensity and i wanna see what everyone here thinks of them

&lt;blockquote&gt;i thaught of a new way that bots could be made, it should reduce lag by lots but im not sure if it will work so i thaught i might run it by some people who would know.

Runescape works by someone clicking the screen, this sends messages to the client, which sends messages to the server. Bots work by taking out the first party, and just sending messages from the client to the server by reading the scripts and doing what they tell it to.

my thaught is that possibly someone could make a bot which didnt have the client open on the screen. just put your username and password in and the client loggs in the account but the USER ISNT. then commands can be typed into a box and that sends the messages to the server. that way the screen doesnt show up, thus reducing lag.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
after this i also thaught of an easier but less effective way, which is just having the black command screen and not the window, but your still logged in. but i found out today that its already been done with aryan-rune

and i made this post today

&lt;blockquote&gt;I just thaught of another idea.
scar works by looking for a set colour and clicking it.
but doing this doesnt let you open more than 1 at a time.
maybe a colour clicker could look for the colours in the client, not on the screen. So more than 1 could be used.

also, posted on another site (cant remember which) is another idea which i dont take credit for. (this is in my words)

scar is a good program but can confuse colours and stuff up.
someone could make a client to go with scar, but change it clientside to make scar work better but is still undetectable.
eg: if someone wanted to mine coal, the road could be pitch black with coloured &quot;stepping stones&quot; and the coal rocks pink.
so scar could find the colours easier and it wouldnt mess up.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>SCAR can look in the client if you set the target thing on it.<br>
SCAR doesn’t just work by looking for a set of colors…It can find bitmaps too</p>
