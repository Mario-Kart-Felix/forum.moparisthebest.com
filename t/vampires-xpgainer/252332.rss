    <title>Vampire&#39;s XpGainer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vampires-xpgainer/252332</link>
    <description>This is  XpGainer for a Myspace app. Vampires. Must have done mission for it to pick up.  
I sugest having screen resolution of 1024x768 or higher. Xp gained info is set for &quot;Fight a Sewer Wererat&quot; for start. There is a option for how many times to repeat a misson. 
If you decide to use something other then  &quot;Fight a Sewer Wererat&quot; You can change xp gained status.
Pick how many minutes and seconds between clicks, Have both set for 0 for normal clicking.
This is the first usefull script Iv made.</description>
