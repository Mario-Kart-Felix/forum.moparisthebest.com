    <title>Storage Server Ideas/Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/storage-server-ideas-help/381458</link>
    <description>So in uni we are creating a storage server, a basic one in C.
its split into various steps, first step was to create a simple server that would store data, with a given key. 
Also only 1 client will connect to it, by authentication, and then you would be able to store and retrieve data. (note data is stored in memory)

Now we have to extend to the data being stored on Disk, and it should be able to retrieve the data after the server is crashed by an attack, (now they will be doing various attacks and we have to protect the server against it much as possible, but eventually they will crash the server), after crashing the server, when rebooted it should load the stored info.

Now only thing they though us was C, everything else we have to use google, for all the networking stuff they only commented in the code. basically they teach you nothing and tell you what to do. btw we work in teams of 3.

now they want us to think of a possible usage for the server, and to market it to them (that&#39;s the midterm test)
basically the server can only for now store information with a key, which can be retrieved by supplying the key.

 i though maybe a book store, supermarket, or something in that line, i wana ask if u guys could think of a good/exciting possible use for the server, since it has to be highly marketable.

Thanks for the help,</description>

              <p>well the purpose for the crash is that it, they want to test if its able to reload and back to performance soon as possible. note this is  a design project, we do alot of documentation, weekly meeting with the project manager, etc… they basically want us to get to used how the industry works.</p>
