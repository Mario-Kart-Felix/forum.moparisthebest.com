    <title>A question about timer/player</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-question-about-timer-player/393498</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone would be able to explain to me how to make a timer that is based on players. What I meant is example an area where 1 player would be 2 minutes, but if it&#39;s 2 players the timer is increased to example 4 minutes.

Can anyone please explain this to me.

Thank you</description>
