    <title>Would someone be interested in forming a team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-someone-be-interested-in-forming-a-team/424119</link>
    <description>I was just wondering if anyone would be interested in make a team to make a small 3d game, it would be nice to have a server/client set up, I am average with server-side programming, I want to use this as a learning experience, just wondering if anyone would like to make a game?

Some people we would need for this:

Some who are good with GUI&#39;s and clients.
Some who are good with networking, and other server-type programming.
Some modelers to model some npc&#39;s and buildings and other props.

There are not applications, just if you are interested in doing this, just say below, if we get enough people who are interested, it may just happen :P</description>
