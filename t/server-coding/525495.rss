    <description>Hello, i am making a new server 
I took the &quot;Acheron&quot; source which is a mixture of trisidiax and PI i think
I&#39;ve already made a website and got a vps ready
The server got eco and skilling in it i want to remove all that and convert it into a PvP server
i want to make everyone be able to spawn and then make some certain items unspawnable for regular players.
If you wish to help me out i&#39;d pay you once the server is completed or if you want to help me for free please do add me on skype
