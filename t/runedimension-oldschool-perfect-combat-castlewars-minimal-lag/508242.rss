		Welcome to the official advertisement thread of RuneDimension. 
		
	History:	RuneDimension started out as a project in August 2012 using a Deception Spawn source, turning that into an economy/eco/skill/combat/pking server. 
				The project sadly closed down 2months after it opened. 
				In March &#39;03 we re-opened the project, there were a lot of complications with the source; it being originally spawn and all. 
				I then hired a sleek developer known as Tim/Someone/Truth, who owned/developed/found Divine-Reality. As we were close friends he was happy to help. A few days later we then realised that using
				Deception&#39;s source was just not an option. 
				We then decided to use Tim&#39;s source from Divine-Reality, a flawless server with amazing features and a lot rewritten for better performance.
				
				
[SIZE=5]Back to the Advertisement: PLEASE BARE IN MIND, THIS ADVERTISEMENT WAS FROM THE DIVINE-REALITY ADVERTISEMENT THREAD. &#39;Deception-Pkz&#39; will reply
vouching that he has agreed to us using his source and he is an active developer within the community.[/SIZE]

Yes sir, we are in the middle of developing a minigame called Antax, which the thread I mentioned in the thread I posted above.<br>
This minigame consists of 4 pvp bosses, in which each kill gives a drop and a point(RuneDimensionPoint) Spent in the shop that will be released with the update.</p>
<p>Also, an RD-Token system is underway, the tokens are dropped globally, you save them up and use them in the Tokens Store to obtain items that are in the donators store… And more!</p>

Why is it that I see violationx and Divine-Reality in your pictures, but the title is RuneDimension?<br>

<p>So you have some mystery in your life.[/quote]</p>
<p>Doesn’t matter which other server name’s you see in his advertisement page because they’re all based off of Rune-Legacy… which was an extremely buggy source…oh and did I mention over-used?</p>

The source was given to me with the donator features being the only way to obtain ultra rares, that’s why on that thread it explains what Tim and I are working on for non-donators to earn the ultra-rares with points that will be obtained with points/tokens from skilling/pvm.</p>
<p>Such as a minigame and throughout skilling having points being randomly awarded in an efficient way.</p>

<p>So the phats etc are earned via skills/combat in some fashion/store in other words? Have you took into consideration though that will make it so the donors will make the most profit?</p>

              <p>I know thread hasn’t been updated in a couple of days but I was browsing and decided to give it a go so going to give some “first impression” critique.</p>
<p>The shops look decent but the donor shop pretty much shows that the server is going to be ran by those who donate. Unless those items are able to be gained an alternate way. (Number one rule: make it fair for everyone!)</p>
<p>The skills are decent xp, not too fast and not too slow.</p>
<p>Still testing out stuff but it’s decent the music sort of surprised me actually heh wasn’t expecting that and had my theater system on talking about being blasted.</p>
<p>I can also see now that it is designated more to the “pker/bosser” sort and not the regular economical view. You should instead of a pk point store make a “server point” store. To save items, to make stuff rare even combine vote points to that! “get blah amount of points for voting!”</p>
<p>Keep the points high so items stay rare. Swap the items out on a weekly basis. Make a couple of the items that are high priced stay in for a month and then to not come back for a year (if you stay up that long)</p>
<p>edit: and I liked what zeke said heh. I do sort of like the idea of having a global npc outlook. Spread out shops in more than one city.</p>
<p>edit <span class="hashtag">#2</span> : personally I find the starter to be a little too much. Maybe a basic attack/strength potion for starter training, 2-3 pieces of food for the common noob, but besides that… shouldn’t really get much. Make them work for it!</p>

People are here to find a server to play, not to get to know you.    This is why I said I’m not gonna join, I assume if you’re running a server you understand it’s almost like a job since you’re taking people’s time and possibly money if they donate.  This is why when you work at, let’s say a convenient store, you can’t just insult customers.  I would 100% leave the store if I got shit for being fat or ugly or whatever else from the cashier.  You just don’t do it.</p>
