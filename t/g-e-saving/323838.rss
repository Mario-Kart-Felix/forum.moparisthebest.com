    <title>.G.E. Saving</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/g-e-saving/323838</link>
    <description>Alright, so I&#39;ve developed my own .Grand.Exchange. No it&#39;s not the real one, it&#39;s a custom one.

But, I have all the saving down. I created a saving method to where it&#39;ll save to a directory. Then at login, when the player logins in it&#39;ll load all buy/sell offers that were saved. 

But, if the server were to get restarted, then the sell/buy offers wouldn&#39;t beable to be loaded again, at all. 

This part I need help with :(</description>

              <p>I’m not sure how it’s done, but you can make it load like character files loads and saves.</p>
<p>Basically the idea is that every offer has it’s own ID, if an item is being sold, it occupies the ID it’s given, with a price range.<br>
If an item is being bought, it searches for the ID of the item the person wants to buy, takes the offer ID, removes it from the list (creating a vacant spot for another item to use), and adds the item to the players pack if he met the price range set by the seller.</p>
<p>An example of this is</p>
<p>Sell ID-Item ID-Price-PlayerName</p>
<p><code>
Sell = 1	1050	2000000	+playerName
Sell = 2	1050	2100000	+playerName</code></p>
<p>If a person offers an amount closer to Sell = 1, than Sell = 2, it will take off Sell = 1 from the list, giving the player who bought it an item with the ID of 1050 (Santa Hat).</p>
<p>After removing Sell = 1 from the list, it should look like this now.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Sell = 2	1050	2100000	+playerName</code></pre>
<p>And if someone wants to sell something else, it’ll replace Sell = 1, instead of creating useless spots. And you can probably make an method where you can search for Sell ID’s if people wanna buy from a specific person.</p>
<p>I’m not too skilled at Java, but I’m pretty sure this is possible.</p>
