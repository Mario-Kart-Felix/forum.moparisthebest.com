    <title>Help, (dying and losing items) [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-dying-and-losing-items-508/285429</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, many will think this is a &quot;stupid&quot; question, even though it may be I need some help.
I&#39;m working on a 508 server, and I would like to know how to make people lose their items on death.
Obviously the source creator, my source is &quot;Mithscape V1&quot;, made it so that there were PvP drops.

My question mainly is how do I change back the drops and make players lose there items?
If somebody could post a link to a tutorial or thoroughly explain it for me I&#39;d be very grateful!
thank you :D[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 25, 2009, 07:06:44 pm[/size][hr].</description>
