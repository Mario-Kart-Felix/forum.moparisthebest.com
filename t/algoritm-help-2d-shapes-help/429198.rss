    <description>I am writing a simulation on Reverse Osmosis and I need help with two things. The second thing will be done after the first thing. 

The first thing is I need help defining a Square with boundaries and line segments within that square. The line segments with defined boundaries that have wholes in between them to represent a &quot;permeable membrane.&quot; Then i need help with setting so many circles to represent molecules that flow in between the two sides. Then comes the second part.

The second part is for an algorithm and a method that counts the amount of &quot;molecules&quot; that pass through the permeable membrane and then counts per second. 

What I currently have is a system to tick every second 300 times a given int that = 0 so it says, &quot;1 Second Tick, &quot; + moleculeCount + &quot; have passed through the membrane.&quot; It writes it onto the Command Prompt and a text document. If anyone could help me I would be most greatful.</description>

              <p>I’ve actually been able to set conditions and variables for different scenarios for the simulation to get different sets of data to compare. I actually won a scholarship with it aswell so I amm excited to minor in Computer Science.</p>
