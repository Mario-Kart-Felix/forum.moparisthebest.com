    <description>Me, yet again!, with my loading screen stuck on 0% as usual(seems spelled wrong) I try to fix myself before asking. I tried changing my location of my cache and changing my Cache constants to where is was in source folder.... I also tried changing it to be in just my c:\ or if it was c:\revengescapecache
Yes it is a revengescape cache... I compiled and got 4 errors and 2 errors on my client compiler...
I am running jdk version 1.6.0_25 and my computer is running windows xp
Thanks for your time</description>

A lot of servers just put the new cache in a Refactored client (at least thats what I’ve seen). But if it is coded from blank or an IP changer I wouldn’t know.
