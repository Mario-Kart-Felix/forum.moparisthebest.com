    <description>I portfowarded, went in client.java and gui.java for my client. Do I need to change anything else?</description>

<p>That has NEVER worked for me. Utorrent sucks, it doesn’t do anything at all when it comes to forwarding ports.</p>
<p>OT: Okay, so you forward port 43594 for the TCP and UDP protocol? If so, you’re straight. Now if you’re trying to host your server and/or want your friends to play, make two copies of your client(two folders);</p>
<p>One named private(FOR YOU)<br>
One named public(FOR OTHERS)</p>
<p>In your private folder which contains your client, make sure all of the IP’s in client.java and gui.java’s are 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>Then compile, and save. Use this client to login to your server, and do not distribute that client to anyone. It is only for you to connect.<br>
Finally, in your public folder, change the IP’s in client.java and gui.java to your NO-IP. Or your Hamachi IP/VPS IP.</p>
