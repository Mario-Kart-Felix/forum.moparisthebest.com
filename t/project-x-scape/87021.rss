    <title>Project X Scape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-x-scape/87021</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on a project all by myself, Project X Scape, PXS. It&#39;s been six months since i started working on this project, 30 mins a day not alot. because i was busy with my other servers. so i was wondering if i can YOUR help in making my server better.

- i remade the whole entire autospawn.cfg and shops.cfg. There really isn&#39;t the need for 40+ shops in a server and most of them are just there for no purpose at all. so i have about 13 shops on my server selling alot of stuff. and for the autospawn.cfg i deleted everything and wrote in the monsters and NPCs, one by one, it was a huge hassle lol trust me. 88 lines of code, there are bankers everywhere, walking around, and there isnt any in the banks, but there is at least 1 or 2 bankers in every city, EG: falador, varock, lumbridge, etc.

so any help would be appreciated! =)



those are the two mains points, im trying to do, the rest is done. just need suggestions where to add monsters/shops/ and/or what to add to the server.
