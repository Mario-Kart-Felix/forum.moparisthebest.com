              <p>This is how to do it, this is to download keytool <a href="http://start.ubuntu.com/8.10/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://start.ubuntu.com/8.10/</a><br>
open KeyTool UI.jnlp and sign your new rscd.jar file.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open KeyTool UI!</li>
<li>On the left collumn, find where it says “Create” and double click on it.</li>
<li>Click on “Keystore”</li>
<li>Look to the right, it says “*Keystore File:” with a floppy disk icon beside it.</li>
<li>To the right of that is a list of choices with radio buttons. Choose “JCEKS”</li>
<li>Click on the floppy disk icon</li>
<li>Navigate up to Desktop and type “secret” beside where it says “File Name:” then click “Save file”</li>
<li>Below find where it has the mask icon beside "Keystore password: and click the mask</li>
<li>Enter a password. Repeat it and then click “OK”</li>
<li>Now at the bottom of the program click “OK”</li>
<li>Back to the list on the left, double click on “Keystore’s entry”</li>
<li>Double click on “Private key, with vers. <span class="hashtag">#3</span>”</li>
<li>Double click on “RSA”</li>
<li>On the right, it says “*Keystore File:” with a folder icon beside it.</li>
<li>To the right of that is a list of choices with radio buttons. Choose “JCEKS”</li>
<li>Below find where it has the mask icon beside "Keystore password: and click the mask</li>
<li>Type in the password you used before and click “OK”</li>
<li>Now scroll down to where it says “Common (or domain) name:” and click on the pencil icon</li>
<li>Type in your website URL. If you don’t have one, make one up and press “OK”</li>
<li>Scroll down to where you see “2-letter country code:” and click the pencil icon</li>
<li>If you are in the US, type “US” and press “OK”</li>
<li>Now a window will pop up. It says “Enter new private key entry’s alias:”</li>
<li>Type in an alias of your choice. Type in a password and repeat it. (Use the same as before to avoid problems)</li>
<li>Click “OK” and then get out of those extra windows.</li>
<li>Go back to the list on the left, double click on “Sign file with private key”</li>
<li>Double click on “Embedded signature”</li>
<li>Click on “JAR”</li>
<li>To the right where it says “*Unsigned JAR file:” click the folder icon.</li>
<li>Navigate over to the Open RSCD Webclient folder you have your rscd.jar located and select that file.</li>
<li>Below should be “*Keystore file:” To the right of that are the radio buttons again. Choose JCEKS</li>
<li>Click the folder icon and navigate to your desktop where secret.jce is saved and select that file.</li>
<li>Below should be a mask icon asking for your Keystore password. Type in your password that you have been using.</li>
<li>Below that should be “*Signed JAR file:” with a floppy disk icon to the right. Click that icon!</li>
<li>Navigate over to where the Open RSCD Webclient folder is that has rscd.jar.</li>
<li>This time don’t select rscd.jar! Instead, type “web” in to the “File Name:” box and click “Save file”</li>
<li>At the bottom of the program click “OK”</li>
<li>A window should pop up. Look at the top where it says “Private Key (keypair) &amp; Trusted Certificate Entries:”</li>
<li>You should see an alias of your own making right below. Select that.</li>
<li>Now at the bottom of the window where it says “Enter respective password:” type in your password from before.</li>
<li>Click OK and you’ve done it</li>
</ol>
<p>This is for RSC but im sure its almost same Idea for RS2</p>
