    <description>So I followed this tut [url=http://forums.google.co.uk/index.php?topic=1695.0]http://forums.google.co.uk/index.php?topic=1695.0[/url] on how to make my client a webclient and did everything right i had some troubles with the sprite thing though i couldnt find it in my class9.java..
So I carried on and did the lunar ones and then I made Client.jar the way it says and signed it and everything but when I put the html on a website it gets stuck at &quot;Starting up&quot; 

 I will answer any questions about what I did and what I have to fix this, please help.</description>
