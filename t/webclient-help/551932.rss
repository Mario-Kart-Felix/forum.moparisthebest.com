    <description>Not sure what&#39;s going on, i don&#39;t have an actual domain like &quot;solace.com&quot; its more so like this &quot;www.solace.webs.com&quot;
i don&#39;t know if this has anything to do with why the webclient is not working but it would be nice to get it up soon..

I&#39;m pretty sure everything is done right.. i tried to change the html code a few different times it still keeps doing the same thing.</description>

              <p>There is no way to get around this unless every single player who goes on your web client changes the exceptions on the java security settings. From personal experience, nobody even does it and most of the time it doesn’t even work.</p>
<p>You just got to accept it, only a handful of servers with the funds to pay for the certificate will gave a webclient. And that is only about 6 servers altogether.</p>

<p>Fair enough, but i’m pretty sure nowadays there has gotta at least be some way to do it free…</p>

              <p>[quote=“Welliton_inc, post:2, topic:551932”]Well first of all, let me just say this before I even answer your question:</p>
<p>Even if you are able to get a domain which supports jar files and your client is webclient ready, unless you pay a hefty sum, (usually around $100) you will not be able to have a webclient.</p>
<p>This is because of Java’s new security procedures, in which they made it so any self-signed application would not be able to run unless it had a Java certificate. Before you could atleast set your java security to medium which would sort the problem but they have since removed the option to do so. Your only way would be to get everyone who plays the webclient to add your webclient to the exceptions list, which is irritating and many people won’t understand how to do so (some even say it doesn’t work for them regardless).</p>
<p>Okay very understanding, how would i go about the Java certificate? I can at least try to add it and see if it helps.</p>
<p>So yeah. You can’t really have a webclient unless you pay serious bux.[/quote]</p>
