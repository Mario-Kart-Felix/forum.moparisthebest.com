    <description>I&#39;m trying to create a webclient, and I&#39;m trying to jar an eclipse 639 client. can someone walk me through step by step what to do? I&#39;d prefer not to use skype or Teamviewer, as its late and I&#39;ll probably be checking this in the morning.

I jarred it without a problem, its just that the jar file doesnt open, and I have no idea why. Dont say google is my friend, because, unfortunately, this time google was not a friend. There is so much vagueness around making webclients I couldnt find any information, so it would be nice if someone could give me a step by step tutorial on how to properly make an eclipse 639 jar file.</description>

              <p>Did you Jar it correctly? Open it with a archive program (WinZip, 7Zip, etc) and check to make sure your main class is there. Check the manifest file and check if the main class is set. Otherwise, run the Jar file with a command prompt with the following syntax:</p>
<p>java -jar YourFileName.jar<br>
pause</p>
