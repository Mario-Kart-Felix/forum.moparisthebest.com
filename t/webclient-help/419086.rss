    <title>Webclient help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-help/419086</link>
    <description>Hi. I am trying to make a webclient. My base is hybridpvp/dspk/erasedpkz, put together.. my source is insindiax. No, I am not leeching, I changed a lot of shit, and I can show you before you help me if you like. 

My coder has done the jarsign whatever shit, and we get error click for details at the top.

If someone can help me make a webclient, I&#39;m willing to give a nice little prize.. =)

If you choose to help me, it must be through teamviewer because I want to see what&#39;s going on, plus you could turn off the site after my little prize is in your possession.

I have portforwarded, and have no-ip, so I don&#39;t need hamachi or some shit. Thanks!</description>
