    <description>Hey guys,

I need help making the files from my www/data folder to download onto peoples computers that run the webclient. I have managed to get it to work (signing the jar and others..) and a folder saves onto the pc, but the files don&#39;t save in their at all, and it will disconnect my internet for some reason, I think thats when it tries to download.

I need someones help on here, maybe MSN &amp; teamview, please reply back or add me on j.a.m.e.z@live.com

Thanks!</description>
