    <title>Help finding a download?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-finding-a-download/539087</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure alot of you know what I&#39;m looking for right off the bat and I don&#39;t have internet access for that long. I&#39;m looking for a RSPS client and source I can download and change the run jdk to play offline. Most caches nowadays are online via dropbox URL in which you need internet access to run. I just want to find one I can play offline alone, I do not plan on posting it online, nor do I plan on calling it my own.

If you decide to help, please make sure I can run it offline and new(er) interface.

Thanks.</description>

              <p>to your first question, yes. I play it bymyself almost everyday. Every source should be able to be played offline. just look around and download one you think looks good, and then take your internet off to see if you can play it offline, but 99.999% of the time you should be able to play any server offline if your just by yourself. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> hope i helped ya</p>

              <p>That’s exactly what I want man. I just want to play alone. The rune evo you were talking about has the source and client download and no more internet connection required? I also wanted the 317 revision with a newer interface, like where the emotes have the pictures, not the words. Also no customs.</p>

              <p>what type of server do you want? a older style 317? or a newer revision like 718 and higher? Il just say this now, if you want a newer revision type id get the new rune evo v3, it has alot of content and full jad and kiln and a buncha awesome features.</p>
<p>oh and even if has to download the cache from the internet then you only have to do it once and it will work for ya offline. I also download sources and change stuff around that i want, and i only play them offline by myself or with people that come over to my house or i go to their house.</p>
