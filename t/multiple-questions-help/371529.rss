    <description> :confused: ok i need some help... first of all i am running a delta-based client with bluurs client... ok the mithril dragon is in the right place, drops the right stuff, and blows fire, but it shows up as a lvl 69 troll (fail)... how do i add a donator point system?... and i cant figure out what im doing wrong when i put other peoples customs into my client... i recently added a staff of light, cyan whip, and a royal armor set. the staff of light has everything but the model right... it shows up as a weird dwarf head... the cyan whip is no different than the abyssal whip (same color same everything, just different name)... and the royal armor set freezes the client when i spawn any piece... i added the ints to class8.java in client folder, and added all the models in the models folder. i also added the items to item.cfg to give stats and prices, but it wont work plz help?!?!?
