    <title>Problem getting online. [I Already Portforwarded]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-getting-online-i-already-portforwarded/447061</link>
    <description>I portforwarded correctly, I checked on http://www.canyouseeme.org/ and http://yougetsignal.com/ and they both said the port was open. I setup no-ip correctly, all 3 options have green ticks.

I set the port and IP in my client, and my server. The client works. There&#39;s no errors. 

But whenever I load it up, it always says error connecting to server.

Any help?</description>

              <p>You need 2clients.<br>
One for yourself and one that you are going to upload and let others play on it.<br>
On the one you got go to gui.java and search for serverip, behind that you will find an ip change that to your ipv4 adres, you can find that in cmd by typing ipconfig.<br>
You need to do that because you can’t connect to your own ip adress.<br>
On the client that you are going to upload change that ip in the gui with the no-ip adress.<br>
Hope it helped … <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
