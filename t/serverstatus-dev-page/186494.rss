    <title>ServerStatus Dev Page</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/serverstatus-dev-page/186494</link>
    <description>I am planning on making many changes to the serverstatus page in the near future, and instead of dangerously operating on the existing page, I made a serverstatus dev page so that people could view the progress and comment on it.

http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatusdev.php

Any comments so far? What else should I change (registrations and edits are disabled for now, just in case)  What would you like to see on/in it?

edit: New proposal here:

<p>A census in the clients sounds like a good idea.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Alright, but if you really want to garuntee the safety of your members, then simply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Get each and every client approved by a staff member (most likely MSCP Mods as global moderators cant be bothered.) This might seem like a hassle, but the people requesting approval have to be patient. It <span class="bbcode-b">CAN</span> be done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once approved, that client can be uploaded to a seperate server, or even your own (<a href="http://moparisthebest.com/moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/moparisthebest.com</a>) and kept there. Bandwidth shouldnt be a problem, because just about the same amount will be taken up regardless if they use yours or their own. Space on that server could be a problem, but requirements (since most of the people here wouldnt think of these) could be something like: no cache included, no other files included, just class files etc. But if space IS a problem, then that extra server can come in. There are plenty of free hosts. And, now that I think of it, you can very cheaply direct link a .jar file from Uppit and run it like that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup a quick system linking to those approved clients. There could be a user/pass/email/other credentials needed to get the link to that client and to post it on the server status page, etc. You could also work on a login-system for the status page where the only way to view it is by logging in using your <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> account. Then you can link between accounts and clients easily and efficiently. Not to mention, security-wise that would be a good idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only way a client on that server can be modified is if a staff member uploads over that file/overwrites it. There could be a few ways around this, something like having the link change every upload and disabling the ability to upload over existing clients. Instead, just delete them. That way no harm can be done unintentially by the server owner. And I’m pretty sure the staff here can be trusted enough. Maybe MSCP mods approve, then admins upload if you really do care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To quicken up the pace of approving clients, a quick bytecode scanner can be made. Sounds foolish, but when the task is to look through an entire project like we would have to, its a great idea. I’ve started on one earlier (in attempt to learn and practice regex in Java), and it actually turned out great. It can do something like warn you of dangerous or potentially harmful code. If some is found, then the moderator could quickly check on it, etc. And if speed is an issue, we could switch to BCEL or ASM, or any other bytecode library. (I only used regex because like previously stated, it was to learn and practice it. Turned out quite fun in the end.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, there’s my point of view. I really think its possible, and wouldnt be too hard to fix up.</p>

hey possibly adding a census mod to mine and your client? really see where people are logging in. also the ability to have their server link to a custom client may be in order since many are using their own web clients these days.<br>

              <p>Seems good, the only thing I would think is that people would put in some random name, and not bother restricting it to just your ip, because most people would ignore that. The only way I could see that being implemented: there would have to be a tutorial written on how to do so, otherwise the help sections would be flooded with the same topics numerous times. This is because the majority of the people with servers (the ones that ask me for help anyways) don’t overally know a lot about Java, and only know how to edit names and such.</p>
<p>My idea is that you allow a server ip/port to be edited <span class="bbcode-b">once</span> at least 48 hours after the original posting. That I know can be done. Then, you would need to check to see if the server is online, and if so, you would re-list the uptime at 100%. However this could only be done <span class="bbcode-b">once</span>. One other thing I would think of is that, could you also match the two server ips, and if they are exactly the same, deny them from being changed which would not allow them to be brought to 100%.</p>

              <p>That might be possible, I did allow deletion at first but as Tico said people kept deleting + reposting to get back to 100% uptime, so it was removed.</p>
<p>edit:<br>
Additional proposal:</p>
<p>There is a massive problem with people posting incorrect IPs and/or ports to keep a 100% uptime, this works because all i check is if the port is open or not.  This is unfair to people who have better servers and play by the rules. Therefore I am considering writing code that will actually log into a server with a given username and password to test if it is online or not, this would be much more reliable and less prone to faking, also it would ensure that any servers on the serverstatus page can be logged into with the moparscape client.</p>
<p>I can imagine two potential ways of doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would give a generic username and pass that I would use to log into every server, this would require that each server restrict that login to my specific IP so that it cannot be used by anyone else as everyone would know it.</li>
<li>I can require that each time a server is posted that they provide me with a username and password that I would keep in the database to log into their specific server, then they would just have to keep it a secret themselves, or again they could restrict the login to my specific IP.</li>
</ol>

              <p>The one thing that I think would help a lot is adding an option to delete the server, without waiting for it’s uptime to go below 40%. For example, I added my server about a year ago to the page, when I was using a no-ip domain. Now, I’ve bought a domain name, and would like people to use it (it cost me money).</p>
<p>Normally you would have to leave your server off for the uptime to go down, but luckily I had put in port 2666 (a fake server) so bots that used the page wouldn’t crash my server, so I just shut off the fake server. But, it is taking an extremely long time for the uptime percent to drop, and when I try and add the server with the new domain it says that it is already listed.</p>
<p>So being able to remove your server would help.</p>
