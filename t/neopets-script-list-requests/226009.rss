    <title>Neopets Script list + Requests</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/neopets-script-list-requests/226009</link>
    <description>Well i got bored with coding scripts for Runescape so ive decided that I will help this section, all you have to do is post the name of the game you want a bot for and ill see what i can do, im also going to list some of the currently available ones (with credits!) I will try my best to complete your requests with as much time as i can get

If you wish to have your script removed from the list please tell me. All the instructions for the scripts NOT done by me have them on the original post (links below).
