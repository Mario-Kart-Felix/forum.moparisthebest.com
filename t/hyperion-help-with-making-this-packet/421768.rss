    <title>[Hyperion] Help with making this packet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-help-with-making-this-packet/421768</link>
    <description>I am trying to make a packet to handle clicking an item, and I have gotten pretty far, called the packet in configuration.cfg, Made it, I am trying to make it notice an item Id tho.. I am using this code: 

[code]
private int id = Item.getId();
[/code]
but it says I cannot access Item.getId(); from a static reference, I have been working on this, but cannot quite get it.</description>
