    <description>Hey everyone,

I am looking for a updated version of &quot;Toms cache editor&quot;. Sadly the version i have at the moment is outdated and will not load my cache it just freezes. I have searched for a little while and cannot find a updated one mabey because there is not one or i just suck at searching :L 

If anyone here has a updated version or some similar program i would be extremely greatful if i could get a link

*EDIT*
I decided to run the Jar with CMD and i kept getting this error;

[code]
Badseek - pos:(random number) len:97539058[/code]
I did some further investigating and i believe that the problem is my cache size, the &quot;main_file_cache&quot; is too big, is there anyway to compress it down?

Many Thanks

              <p>Unfortunately, the only way you can edit/remove things from the cache is if you can actually access it with a cache suite. I believe someone released a cache editor that could load bigger caches, but I’m not quite sure where because I can not find the link to it at the moment.</p>
