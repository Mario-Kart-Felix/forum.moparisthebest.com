    <title>[PI] cache help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-cache-help/383823</link>
    <description>hey i have a webclient for my PI based server and it downloads the cache to the c:/ drive as normal, the problem is the cache is named of a different server. i have tried to change this but cannot figure out how to do it. i have changed the cache download link, i have changed the thing in signlink.java, still renames it to the other server in the c:/ drive
if you can help or you think you know where about in my client this is located so i can change it that would be appreciated because i have spent over an hour trying to change this so far and it has not worked
this is important also because i cannot update the cache and i just added stuff to it  :eek:</description>
