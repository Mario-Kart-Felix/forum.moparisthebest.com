              <p>Well, I’ll tell you the story. Although there is alot of “theories”. So about a week ago we get a message saying Bezza is going on vacation, server will be up on monday. Others say he left on monday for vacation, but I think that was made up. But he apparently was logged on mopar while he was on vacation. People have said his friends know his password so they just got on. But not 100% sure. So everyone was spamming his thread about when it would be up, and everyone got pissed at eachother. So atm we are just waiting … To hear something.</p>
