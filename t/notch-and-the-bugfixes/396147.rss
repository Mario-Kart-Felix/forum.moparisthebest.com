              <p>Wow, I guess Notch really was looking through the impressive lists people had of bugs. Glad Notch and (most likely as well) Jeb sat down to get most of this fixed. Although, what bug was possible on creating blocks at top-level?</p>
<p>Now to wait for Single Player Commands, and TooManyItems to be updated <em>sigh</em>.</p>
<p>EDIT - At least when its released.</p>

<p>What’s a hatch? Like a floor door? Awesome.</p>
