    <title>Spawning food in wildy with quest book command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spawning-food-in-wildy-with-quest-book-command/392536</link>
    <description>Hi guys. How do I make this disabled in wildy I still want it when your not in wildy but I want it disabled when your in wildy so you can&#39;t buy food from the quest book command. 

Because I have a command there wich says &quot;Sharks&quot; when you press it your bags fills up with sharks.
I want that to be disabled so you can&#39;t spawn food in wildy from it.</description>
