    <description>Source: Delta                  Problem: heightLevel                             There is no errors upon compiling this also.

Hi all, I got a pretty simple problem, but I fixed it last time I did it but that was about a year ago and I have long forgotten it.

Well, I have tried to add an up and down command so I could work on my Staff HQ, which in-fact has 3 stories.
I just need the code set-up for making stairs, ladders, etc. to go up or down, and the command to go up or down.

So far, I have tried these codes

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;up&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1){
toX = absX;
toY = absY;
heightLevel += 1;
updateRequired = true;
}[/code]

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;up&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1){
toX = absX;
toY = absY;
heightLevel += 1;
updateRequired = true;
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}[/code]

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;up&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1){
toX = absX;
toY = absY;
heightLevel += 1;
}[/code]

And for the object I pretty much did the same thing with the teleports, but didn&#39;t keep the command obviously :P (Added the object ID and all.

So, if anyone has any possible solutions to this please post what you know.

P.S. It kind of works, but at the same time no, I go up the stairs, relog, it&#39;s the 2nd floor but the freaking objects I spawned on the first floor are appearing there to.
