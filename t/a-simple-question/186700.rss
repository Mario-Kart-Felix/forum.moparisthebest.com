    <title>A Simple Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-simple-question/186700</link>
    <description>Well, some of you that post to this may know me since I&#39;ve been actively posting for about an hour now..I&#39;ve decided to actually start helping people and in return, them, helping me. Now, I think it&#39;s safe to say that the Moparscape Server Status Page is fixed. Yet, it still says, for me, that I can only Register one Server. Now either someone knows my password and changed the name, or something is messed up. I&#39;ve looked through the list for the past 5 days now and cannot find &quot;DELETE&quot; or &quot;Scottscapepkz&quot;...anywhere. Help is appreciated guys.</description>
