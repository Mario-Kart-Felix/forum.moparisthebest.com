    <description>on pimpscape source, before you edit stuff you have 135 stats and 253 combat. i changed the max stat to 99 but my combat is now 185. i took out summoning and stuff but it is still 185 combat. does anyone know how to make it so im 99 all and have 126 combat? thank you for your time. if you dont know, please dont spam or anything.. and yes i changed the getlevelforexp public int to return 99 and everything from a tutorial i used, but that does not let me have 126 combat, just 185 combat.</description>
