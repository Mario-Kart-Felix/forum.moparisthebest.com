    <title>I can&#39;t upload pictures without it failing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-upload-pictures-without-it-failing/350877</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had a problem for quite some time now with uploading photos to a sharing site, E.G Tinypic, photobucket, etc. I have tried Firefox and Opera, neither of them will upload. It will just say the upload failed. This has been happening for a few weeks now and I am wondering if anyone had the slightest idea on what&#39;s up, since I never had this problem before.

I can upload other file extensions to sites such as mediashare and megaupload, but anything dealing with pictures for photo sharing sites is a no go. Changing the file extension from bmp to jpeg does not work either.</description>

<p>I was thinking the same thing about IE but he tried more browsers and it didn’t work.</p>

<p>edit: after that go ahead and clear you’re browsers cache, browsing history and everything else.<br>
edit2: try doing this with firefox, it might be more effective</p>
