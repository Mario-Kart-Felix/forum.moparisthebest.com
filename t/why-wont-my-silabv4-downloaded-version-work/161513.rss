    <description>ok look, since silab updated, silabsoft version 5doesn&#39;t work with silabs now, everyone&#39;s saying go to the silabsoft forums and download v4, so i did and i saved to desktop, then extracted and saved the file, i opened it, its starts loading up then the error thing comes up, i have most java updates, could anyone tell me what this is, if you help me with my problem i will go on real rs and pay you 100k :) i really need help with this.
