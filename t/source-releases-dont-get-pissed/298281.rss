    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/source-releases-dont-get-pissed/298281</link>
    <description>Well, I believe Rsc is boring and I&#39;m never here anymore because I am busy.

So I decided to release some sources that might help and piss alot of people off.

Oh &amp; I&#39;ll be explaining how I got them because some are funny on the &quot;fuckups&quot; they did, all the sources will be in one file *50Mb + sources.

Firstly I will not be releasing the RscReloaded source because uhmm.. Yeah I have no clue what happened to it which was over a year of work but eh I don&#39;t care.

First source.
p.r.o.j.e.c.t p.2.p
Features.. 
- Auto detection system - easy fix, messed up.
- Auto catching - sorta fixed.
- Gnome Ball game - lol&#39;d at this.
- K\d Ratio
- Party system ect ect.
- Quest system.. ect.
- Runecrafting

Next Release -
SwagPk (Demonik based)
They will both show dates as there files.
These are fully developed Demonik sources - Most bugs fixed, I know a few more
To fix another bug its the duel yourself, just go to the duel handler and add the code so you can&#39;t duel yourself.
Everything is fixed. it does not come with the client, it comes with the src.
Dueling fully fixed.
Magic fully fixed
everything.
Dropping everything
You won&#39;t be able to just copy code out of it, you will need to go through the processes and add them in if you want everything to work. ect figure it out yourself.

RscF2P (rscd based)
This is another source of mine.
Everythings fixed.
Completly F2P.
Good Exp rate ect ect.
K\D ratio built in client
No member skills work.
Auto catching doesn&#39;t work.
Jailing System ( Detects bots - fixed)
Clan system.
Quest system - Comes with a quest.
Comes with client, database\forums
Good layout ect..

(These forums and database will also work for the google source)

The next source Release will be 
LLSCAPE. ( Demonik Based)
LLSCAPE is the base of SwagPk but improved 100x better.
Everything is fixed
doesn&#39;t come with the client src only.
Pk point system
clan system
dueling fixed
magic hacking fixed
ranging fixed
new mini games
etc etc.
Quest system etc. 

Oh and you will see some files like rscd folder and forums folder (this is the database just play it in the data/mysql part of xxamp then the database will be imported or something like that.

So yeah
have fun with these sources I really don&#39;t care.

Hate\Flame\Comment\Love.

<p>This is not the most updated Rsc Reloaded source. This one is quite old.<br>
When Jessekins took this one it did not have everything fixed, and the most updated RscR source will never be released.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 28, 2009, 04:40:45 pm[/size][hr][quote=“Anc13nts253”][quote author=darscape link=topic=394685.msg2934227#msg2934227 date=1251466642]<br>

<p>Also… Credits to mario\snoopy for my source? Which I worked on for over a year you mean Credits to me and Joe, and Termz. Jessekins coded nothing, Mario\snoopy howd they even get involved on coding my source? No.</p>

Yeah, I’m pretty sure hence you said thanks to him for making the new gnome ball mini game and fixing the auto detection system and accepting him into your coding team after all of that work.<br>
