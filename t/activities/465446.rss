    <description>I am currently a sophomore in high-school and finally decided to get interested in some kind of school activity. However, there is a catch. I have no clue what I want to do! I have spent weeks thinking about an activity that I would enjoy and benefit from and came up with a few ideas :

[ul][li]ROTC (the kids in it now get made fun of)[/li]
[li]Anime (the kids in it now are classified as dorks)[/li]
[li]Football (I am not very coordinated)[/li][/ul]

I know I should do whatever I enjoy no matter what, I just don&#39;t want to get made fun of for the rest of my high-school years.

Moving on. It doesn&#39;t even necessarily have to be an activity within school, it can be something that takes place at home (or both at home and school) So I began to brainstorm a bit more and came up with a few more activities that would take place outside of school:

[ul][li]MMA or Boxing[/li]
[li]Instrument lessons (Such as guitar)[/li]
[li]Volunteer work[/li][/ul]

Those are just a few ideas I came up with that I believe I would enjoy the most. I just don&#39;t want to be the guy that did nothing all through high-school.

So, the point of this thread is to get suggestions on what I should do. You could even criticize my ideas if you wish. So, with all of this being said, I leave you all with a few questions to answer:

[ul][li]Would you participate in an activity knowing you&#39;d get made fun of?[/li]
[li]Have you gone through high-school without participating in some sort of activity?[/li][/ul]

If you&#39;re currently attending high-school, do you plan on being active in a particular activity?

Thanks to those who answer and provide advice!</description>

<p>user “Tutorial” posts, user “Tutorials” posts, the only distinction is an S at the end of the word that isn’t immediately obvious, just like say “Loveandpowder”, the only distinction is a d, it’s still deceptive even if there’s no malicious intent, it’s just like how people with 2, 3 badges often get mistaken, people don’t pay enough attention to the names to notice they’re two different people</p>
<p>he doesn’t HAVE to change his name and there’s NO REQUIREMENT for him to change the name but it’s a bit of a “oh, you might want to change your name as it’s near identical to another use on this website who is also quite active and may lead to some confusion”</p>

              <p>I don’t know much about high school ROTC or ROTC in general, but I know that if you do ROTC in college, your tuition is covered(granted you have to do like 5 years of service or something like that). I guess high school ROTC just preps you.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I used to be like all you faggots on this site. I sat inside all day and had no interest in participating in high school activities. When I was a freshman, unbeknownst to me, my mother had signed me up for football. I decided to try it and enjoyed it. When the season ended, I got involved with other shit and eventually when I went to apply for colleges I had varsity football/track captain, model UN(conferences for debating world problems), 350 volunteer hours, student government, etc. But I also had a shit ton of fun/friends that I wouldn’t of had.</p>
<p>Basically, network and try things out. Don’t be like one of the faggots on this site who just sit around all day. Pick something and just have fun with. I’ve been working on surfing lately, very fun hobby.</p>

<p>Yes, and if you are wandering why, I don’t have the slightest clue. However, I have noticed everyone in ROTC are really good friends, almost family-like. I don’t see why they’re in the “geek” category, my school is just full of inconsiderate know-it-alls who are going nowhere in life.</p>
<p>With this being said, I may speak to my guidance counselor about rearranging my schedule. I do have a few friends in the program and they are extremely nice, they are just looked at the wrong way.</p>

              <p>I am currently a sophomore in high-school and finally decided to get interested in some kind of school activity. However, there is a catch. I have no clue what I want to do! I have spent weeks thinking about an activity that I would enjoy and benefit from and came up with a few ideas :</p>
<p>[ul][li]ROTC (the kids in it now get made fun of)[/li]<br>
[li]Anime (the kids in it now are classified as dorks)[/li]<br>
[li]Football (I am not very coordinated)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I know I should do whatever I enjoy no matter what, I just don’t want to get made fun of for the rest of my high-school years.</p>
<p>Moving on. It doesn’t even necessarily have to be an activity within school, it can be something that takes place at home (or both at home and school) So I began to brainstorm a bit more and came up with a few more activities that would take place outside of school:</p>
<p>[ul][li]MMA or Boxing[/li]<br>
[li]Instrument lessons (Such as guitar)[/li]<br>
[li]Volunteer work[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Those are just a few ideas I came up with that I believe I would enjoy the most. I just don’t want to be the guy that did nothing all through high-school.</p>
<p>So, the point of this thread is to get suggestions on what I should do. You could even criticize my ideas if you wish. So, with all of this being said, I leave you all with a few questions to answer:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Would you participate in an activity knowing you’d get made fun of?[/li]<br>
[li]Have you gone through high-school without participating in some sort of activity?[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>If you’re currently attending high-school, do you plan on being active in a particular activity?</p>
<p>Thanks to those who answer and provide advice!</p>
