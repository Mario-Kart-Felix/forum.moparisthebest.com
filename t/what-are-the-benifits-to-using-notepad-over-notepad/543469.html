<p>How many players you have on a server means EVERYTHING. It doesn’t matter if you are some pretending “pro” coder trying to act like you know anything and still get like 2 active players. It ultimately matters if you have the playerbase as playerbase over-rules all.

<p>Lol are you stupid? Your basing someone’s programming skills on the amount of players they get on their server. Look at some of the servers out there that get 300 people most of them are leeched PI shit. Ask any successful programmer 95% use an IDE to program. Sk8rdude is right the only benefit from notepad to notepad++ is the visual and maybe it shows the line numbers with a few other features also.</p>

No, it means nothing here. We’re not talking about your server. We’re talking about a rich text editor over a standard text editor.<br>
If we were comparing my server to your server, then player count would be a <span class="bbcode-u">factor</span>. You have no knowledge of my previous servers player counts, as most of them were never hosted live. My current team (see my signature) isn’t hosting our server until we add more content.</p>

<p>Because when I see these people trying to act like they are some pro coder who looks down on everyone else is stupid. Most of these fudge-cakes just say a bunch of crap on here but never actually prove their server to be anything. If they actually had a fully sucessful server and being a great coder too then you can’t really question what they say. But I know for a fact that most of these idiots can’t even hold 3 players in 3 weeks. I’m not one to boast but atleast my server is semi-sucessful and actually has 40-50 active players on everyday and its only a Delta which I have heavily edited to my needs. Its just stupid for these idiots to easily judge people like me despite whatever they make to be equivilent to some shiet on the floor.</p>

<p>How many players you have on a server means EVERYTHING. It doesn’t matter if you are some pretending “pro” coder trying to act like you know anything and still get like 2 active players. It ultimately matters if you have the playerbase as playerbase over-rules all.

<p>Because when I see these people trying to act like they are some pro coder who looks down on everyone else is stupid. Most of these fudge-cakes just say a bunch of crap on here but never actually prove their server to be anything. If they actually had a fully sucessful server and being a great coder too then you can’t really question what they say. But I know for a fact that most of these idiots can’t even hold 3 players in 3 weeks. <span class="bbcode-b">I’m not one to boast</span> but atleast my server is semi-sucessful and actually has 40-50 active players on everyday and its only a Delta which I have heavily edited to my needs. Its just stupid for these idiots to easily judge people like me despite whatever they make to be equivilent to some shiet on the floor.</p>

Saying “I’m not one to boast” and then boasting, just goes to show that I was right:</p>

<p>Lol are you stupid? Your basing someone’s programming skills on the amount of players they get on their server. Look at some of the servers out there that get 300 people most of them are leeched PI shit. <span class="bbcode-b">Ask any successful programmer 95% use an IDE to program.</span> Sk8rdude is right the only benefit from notepad to notepad++ is the visual and maybe it shows the line numbers with a few other features also.[/quote]</p>
<p>This thread (and especially your post) is so damn cringe-worthy. OP is a successful troll.</p>
