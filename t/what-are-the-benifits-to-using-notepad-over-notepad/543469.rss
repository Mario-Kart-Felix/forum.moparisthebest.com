    <description>The title says it all. Please don&#39;t say, &quot;Use Eclipse.&quot; I find Eclipse very non-user-friendly and it is very slow in loading up.</description>

<p>Cool story broski. Get back to your fail pre-eoc remakes. I’m sure you’ll pay someone to come and DDoS your server so you feel like somebody even cares about your shiet.</p>

              <p>Why hate on the OP?<br>
You know he’s stupid when he said he finds eclipse not user friendly. We know that leeched a server coding in notepad, paying developers and making help threads.</p>
<p>People should learn to accept that and more on.</p>
<p>OT: The benefits are quiet clear. Notepad is a text editor with like 1 feature which will never be used more then once (changing the font size and type). Notepad++ has a ton of buttons, syntax highlighting, console, tabbed pages and more. Seriously does not take a genius to make a direct visual comparison.</p>
<p>Memory wise Notepad++ is still small in usage and disk space.</p>
<p>I see no point to this thread.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, you’re asking a general programming question that doesn’t have to do with hosting a rsps… So how ever many players I have had on a rsps literally means nothing, and the fact that you brought it up means that you were either defending yourself or trying to show some form of superiority over me.</p>

<p>And you my good sir, are a fagit.</p>
<p>How many players you have on a server means EVERYTHING. It doesn’t matter if you are some pretending “pro” coder trying to act like you know anything and still get like 2 active players. It ultimately matters if you have the playerbase as playerbase over-rules all. If nobody plays your fail server then you HAVE FAILED… So next time you speak, get more than 4 people playing a server you make.</p>

<p>How the hell does playerbase have anything to do with what he said…?</p>

</aside>
<p>Because when I see these people trying to act like they are some pro coder who looks down on everyone else is stupid. Most of these fudge-cakes just say a bunch of crap on here but never actually prove their server to be anything. If they actually had a fully sucessful server and being a great coder too then you can’t really question what they say. But I know for a fact that most of these idiots can’t even hold 3 players in 3 weeks. <span class="bbcode-b">I’m not one to boast</span> but atleast my server is semi-sucessful and actually has 40-50 active players on everyday and its only a Delta which I have heavily edited to my needs. Its just stupid for these idiots to easily judge people like me despite whatever they make to be equivilent to some shiet on the floor.</p>
<p>Rant over, I got the info I need.<br>

Saying “I’m not one to boast” and then boasting, just goes to show that I was right:</p>

<p>Lol are you stupid? Your basing someone’s programming skills on the amount of players they get on their server. Look at some of the servers out there that get 300 people most of them are leeched PI shit. <span class="bbcode-b">Ask any successful programmer 95% use an IDE to program.</span> Sk8rdude is right the only benefit from notepad to notepad++ is the visual and maybe it shows the line numbers with a few other features also.[/quote]</p>
<p>This thread (and especially your post) is so damn cringe-worthy. OP is a successful troll.</p>

No, it means nothing here. We’re not talking about your server. We’re talking about a rich text editor over a standard text editor.<br>
If we were comparing my server to your server, then player count would be a <span class="bbcode-u">factor</span>. You have no knowledge of my previous servers player counts, as most of them were never hosted live. My current team (see my signature) isn’t hosting our server until we add more content.</p>

<p>How many players you have on a server means EVERYTHING. It doesn’t matter if you are some pretending “pro” coder trying to act like you know anything and still get like 2 active players. It ultimately matters if you have the playerbase as playerbase over-rules all. If nobody plays your fail server then you HAVE FAILED… So next time you speak, get more than 4 people playing a server you make.[/quote]<br>
How the hell does playerbase have anything to do with what he said…?</p>

<p>Lol are you stupid? Your basing someone’s programming skills on the amount of players they get on their server. Look at some of the servers out there that get 300 people most of them are leeched PI shit. Ask any successful programmer 95% use an IDE to program. Sk8rdude is right the only benefit from notepad to notepad++ is the visual and maybe it shows the line numbers with a few other features also.</p>

<p>I’m not just saying it to piss you off, I’m talking from experience. I spent pretty much 2010-2012 programming in notepad and it got me nowhere. I spent weeks packaging a server when I could have done it in 5 minutes using eclipse lol</p>
