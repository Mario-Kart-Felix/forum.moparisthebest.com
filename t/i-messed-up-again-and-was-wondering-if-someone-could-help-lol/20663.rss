              <p>actually those errors went away like magic… but I see what you mean. Thank you very much! 1 final question (for this 3 hour period =p). How do i make players on my server need to have either</p>
<p>&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3)</p>
<p>OR</p>
<pre><code>      if (playerRights &gt;= 3)
</code></pre>
<p>Basically how can I limit it to the server owner only?<br>
so that they can use the command ::noclip?</p>
<p>I am sick and tired of my friends finding me in hide and seek so I wanna turn it off lol.<br>
still waiting =(</p>
