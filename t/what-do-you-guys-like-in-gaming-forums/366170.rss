              <p>This is sort of sad. I read this topic. And mostly it was all about an argument on some advice, and not really stating what you like in a gaming community or not.</p>
<p>What I look in a gaming community is the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Good Staff (no oh i don’t like you mute staff)</li>
<li>Good content (choices not just about 1 - 2 games)</li>
<li>UPDATES!!! (what i mean is introduce new things, not just say oh so and so is doing this or that)</li>
<li>Activity. I hate gaming forums that just don’t seem to have a point/future</li>
<li>Lastly some community games/server be a nice thing to include.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is what I look for, I don’t care if your 12, or if you can’t speak good english. As long as you can run the website.</p>

<p>I find it very ignorant you react with such arrogance towards constructive criticism. He’s correct, though. I’ve done it many times myself and I’ve reached 10k posts maximum. The fact you can’t face the truth will be your downfall.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to give my honest opinion, I don’t like the theme I find it incredibly ugly and dissatisfying. I’ve not registered and don’t plan too but you should create an option where you can chose to change the theme to suit peoples variational needs. I once heard a term about starting of with a huge amount of boards can be damaging, people say you should start off with a smaller core selection of boards then slowly develop these core boards into a vast array of boards, they say this maximizes posting etc…</p>
<p>if you don’t want advice and feedback regarding your site then you shouldn’t off posted this topic, Blakeman was correct in what he said.I do hope you take my criticism in a friendly way and remain neutral.[/quote]</p>
<p>I thank you for your opinion and apologize for going off.</p>

<p>Don’t waste your time dude. There are plenty of other, <span class="bbcode-i">good</span>, gaming communities with lots of people in them.<br>
Sorry to say this, but I’m being realistic. There is virtually no chance of your community becoming successful.<br>

<p>I find it very ignorant you react with such arrogance towards constructive criticism. He’s correct, though. I’ve done it many times myself and I’ve reached 10k posts maximum. The fact you can’t face the truth will be your downfall.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to give my honest opinion, I don’t like the theme I find it incredibly ugly and dissatisfying. I’ve not registered and don’t plan too but you should create an option where you can chose to change the theme to suit peoples variational needs. I once heard a term about starting of with a huge amount of boards can be damaging, people say you should start off with a smaller core selection of boards then slowly develop these core boards into a vast array of boards, they say this maximizes posting etc…</p>
<p>if you don’t want advice and feedback regarding your site then you shouldn’t off posted this topic, Blakeman was correct in what he said.I do hope you take my criticism in a friendly way and remain neutral.</p>

Go change your tampon, he’s giving you useful information that can actually help you. Don’t make shitty copies of other forums, there is no chance of it becoming big. If it does become big (which it wont), it will eventually die out in about a week of boredom.[/quote]</p>
<p>To add onto this point as well that you don’t seem to understand the amount of errors that can be generated by running your own community, do you feel you have the experience of web development and common sense to tackle issues alone which you have people relying on you for?</p>
