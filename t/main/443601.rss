    <description>Well.. I&#39;m pretty new to programming.
And I was just wondering do all java projects REQUIRE a main class?
Thanks in advance :P</description>

<p>For the most part, yes. Like Taharok said though, there are many different types of java projects, and one of the only ones that specifically uses main() is the standard java program. The majority do have entry points though, such as applets start and init methods, or anything that runs on its own, like some API’s that you initiate classes and then use the rest (something like LWJGL, where you create a game applet and then it starts the rest of the process on its own). There are some API’s that are completely different though, like some that just perform more complex math calculations where you don’t need to initialize anything.</p>

</aside>
<p>But don’t you need to execute your program first, in order to even reach the API’s entry point?  So in turn, all java programs really do need main().<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Not at all. Some APIs are designed to abstract main(). Although there is a main entry point at some point in the code, your implementation of the API does not include an explicit main function.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the OP did mention java ‘projects.’ I considered that different than a program, wherein libraries do not need to have a main method. There are applets and agents to consider as well, both of which are programs without main() entry points, but rather with other entry points (start(), premain(), etc).[/quote]<br>
Ohh I get what you mean then.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. A java project can achieve multiple purposes, only one of which is an executable program by the JVM (for only those require a main method as an entry point). A non-exhaustive list of other uses for Java projects would include: APIs, mobile developments (dalvik apps have a different entry point than sun jvm apps), applets, java agents, and much more. Don’t think of a Java project as a program. Programs are just a subset of what Java projects can be used for.</p>

<p>Again, Taharok takes it up a whole new perspective. ;D</p>
