              <p>Me and my team are currently working on a 508-614 server that we are trying to get near Runescape-Like quality. We aren’t creating it for a release, though. We are creating it for users to play. If you’d like to keep updated on it and join in maybe for beta testing or something. Private message me and we can talk.</p>
