Things like reflection and byte-code editing are more in the grey area, but they certainly aren’t flat out illegal.</p>

<p>The topic is about “can Jagex sue you?” and you replied to one of my posts “whut”. I have shown material that let’s you all see that breaking the client down and manipulating the game (botting) is against copyright law. The law part is the copyright part, comprende?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I replied to your post because it made no sense.</p>
<p>[quote=“The Outsider, post:50, topic:421115”]I beg to differ. I believe some players will get truly screwed over by Jagex as they won’t know how to properly defend themselves. You must of read the lawsuit document about MITB and this site?</p>
<p>Not everyone will have that knowledge and coolness about them. Especially kids (non-derogatory).[/quote]<br>
So, you’re a lawyer?</p>
<p>[quote=“The Outsider, post:54, topic:421115”]Possibly, but then why announce it like that in front of every one and then back off. To me that is attention seeking, intentional or not.</p>
<p>Jagex are good at announcing something, going back on it, going back on themselves again and then going back AGAIN on themselves…[/quote]<br>
They bluff quite a bit - yes, they can sue a player; they could sue ANYONE for ANYTHING. Whether they WIN or not is a different story.</p>
