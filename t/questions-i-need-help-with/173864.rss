    <description>Im using dodian devolution V7

Here are some questions that ive been trying to figure out for a while, yet no one has helped me.

1.)  How do i change the items a player starts with, and the inventory?

2.) How do i make a portal outside yanyill bank, you need a key to enter, once you get key, you enter and it teles you to varrock center?

3.) How do i change the quest menu with my own pages, in other words, how do i edit the quest content in the quest interface?

4.) how do i add   Mute, Kick, IpBAN  to the right click of a player for admins and mods only?

5.) How do i add the &quot;&quot;follow&quot; option?

6.) Does anyone have the code for the doors and stairs for varrock, or varrock castle? 

7.) My monsters dont hit back? how do i fix this?

8.) how do i add objects to certain areas, like a chair out side yanyill bank?

9.) how do i make a menu pop up when people log in?

who ever can answer any of these questions i would greatly apprecate it, also please tell me how to do it in full detail as i am new to this stuff. my msn is zorronux@hotmail.com

Who ever helps will also receive admin status on my server and may get 10$ via paypal. thanks</description>

              <p>ok to change item players start in inv. search the following in the “player” notepad in your source file.</p>
<p>//Giving the player an unique look</p>
<p>that deosnt work search</p>
<p>playerEquipment[playerHat] = 3751;</p>
<p>the numbers after = are the item ids</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>playerEquipment[playeritem] = id;</p>
<p>(player item is like above playerhat, player chest ect.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2008, 08:44:25 AM[/size][hr]Well to make portal you’d have to find the object id for the portal you want and youd have to put it in. I dont exactly know how or where to but i know thats wut u gotta do.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2008, 08:47:31 AM[/size][hr]To change quest menu to say something like “our scape rox” go to client.java or client notepad in your server source file, and search Sendquest, or look for Welcome or Rules. you Ctrl F to search. it should come up with a list of things with the quest names or what it would say in your quest log.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2008, 08:50:43 AM[/size][hr]Well if u have the kick, mute, ban on right click id take that off accept for kick. Make a ::ban or ::ipban command because if you missclick some1 will get banned. But to give to mods, admins + go into where you have the command and look for something like Playerrights = 1,2,3<br>
(one of those) then 1 ==mod 2 ==admin 3 ==owner so if you put that in where it says playerrights==3 only owners can use it.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2008, 08:51:19 AM[/size][hr]not sure how to add follow button sorry.<br>
[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2008, 08:52:37 AM[/size][hr]if u wanna find out the code go on your server (on silab client only) and right click there should be a number. Thats the id.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2008, 08:55:51 AM[/size][hr]well if your monsters dont hit back its probobly the source that allows you to fight without getting hit. Idk exactly how to make em hit.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2008, 08:57:34 AM[/size][hr]to add objects u gotta use globalobject thing. Idk how to do that well.</p>
<p>You gotta build a menu and have a sendmenu command auto for all when they log in,</p>
<p>Hoped this helped a little bit.</p>
