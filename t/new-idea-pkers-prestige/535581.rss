    <title>New idea - pkers prestige?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-idea-pkers-prestige/535581</link>
    <description>So I was reading a topic in server development and this idea came to me. I&#39;d like to get the c ommunity thoughts on what you would think of a system such as this and if you think it would be efficient/fair. 

How it works:
-player gets experience in a skill 
-player can turn in his experience (up to 200m)
-player would then gain &quot;special supplies&quot; such as food that can heal quarter, half, three quarters, and 100% of your hp back. Perhaps even take it a step further there is a potion that can restore your special in the similar fashion and vise versa? These items can be used in the wilderness as well. 

System rules:
-each skill depending on how hard it is will have different rewards. I.e. an easy coking skill would only give a quarter health food item for the 99 as you can gain the 99 in a couple of hours. But something like let&#39;s say slayer which may take anywhere from 10-15 hours might be able to get a 100% food item and a half special item bundle ( or choose a variety of bundles)
-this system can be used as many times as desired as long as they have the experience to substitute for it. 

Pros:
-would keep highscores constantly changing
-could be a great item to merch/to sale to others/barter with!
-would make pking interesting I believe as elite pkers will train other skills to acquire these products.

Cons:
-haters for losing a pk ( their own fault/risk though)
-im sure there are others?

So yeah let me know what you think/what could be improved upon this.</description>
