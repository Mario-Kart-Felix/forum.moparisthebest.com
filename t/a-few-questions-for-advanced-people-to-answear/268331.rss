              <p>Actually, theUnforgiven, I wouldn’t consider using someone elses code to benefit a server leeching.  I would consider leeching taking a code and claiming it to be all-your-own with little or no change done to them.  Exactly like 93% of the old servers that were run by ‘Moparscapians’ back when I joined.</p>
<p>Anyway, I would say it would be O.K. to use someone elses work, just as long as you are not claiming it O.o.</p>
