    <title>jME - Community Project?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jme-community-project/278539</link>
    <description>I thought it would be sick to do a community project using jME.
For anyone thats never checked jme out: http://www.jmonkeyengine.com
Take a look at the screenshots, its more than powerful enough.
It&#39;s easy to use and theres some good tutorials.

Why don&#39;t we get a project rolling, maybe some sort of 3D viewer? Or a simple game? Maybe something that allows for plugins so it can be extended, idk, throw your ideas around here, let me know if you&#39;re up for it.

<p>When I said I know where to get really good motorcycle models, I was actually talking about Archer from the forums, he is great.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The models that people post in the graphics section really aren’t meant for games. With game models you want to have as low of a poly count as you can get while still looking good. You also want to be careful with textures, it’s not good to use more than 2 textures on one model. I guess it depends on which system specs you are targeting though.</p>
<p>If anything gets started I might be able to contribute a little bit.</p>

If i just said guys lets do this and i sat on the side and waited for some people to get it started, nothing would happen.</p>

<p>Well, only the people who have a clue can write the server…</p>
<p>I do like the sound of something like coke studios (classic)  or habbo hotel style in 3d…</p>

              <p>Instead of trying to start a community project (which will fail, sorry) why don’t you start writing it yourself? Maybe when you have something to show for it, as in, awesome screenshots and a few videos, people will be motivated to help you out.<br>
I’m sure you are well intentioned, but it’s just not going to happen unless you take some initiative beyond pressing the new topic button.</p>

<p>I’ve got an idea, we could come up with a game idea, I could implement it with panda3d and python, and you guys could do it with jME and java and we could turn it into a sort of competition, but one where everyone would win. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (both are open source engines and languages, well actually java isn’t yet, but will be at version 7)</p>

Java, imo, would be better. C++ would be better for ‘bigger’ projects. This can be a simple project. And much easier to play…Look at runescape. Don’t look at moparscape.</p>

<p>If you know Java well enough, you’d be able to look at the documentation and be able to learn the constructors and methods…</p>
<p>I made a simple textured app in about an hour after reading this thread.<br>
[/quote]Of course, but theres alot more to it than reading just the documentation. Without an understanding of jME the application will without doubt fail. jME is a very complex yet very simple easy to use engine, but it does require some effort and understanding.</p>
<p>I do agree though, anyone with a good java knowledge will pick it up within a couple hours.[/quote]</p>
<p>I tried another graphics engine, in C++ I think, last year, and I knew C++ then really well. It was reallly complicated, and hard to use.</p>
<p>With JME I can make a simple game in a day and a nice story game in a few months if I tried hard enough (And had all the renders etc ;))</p>
