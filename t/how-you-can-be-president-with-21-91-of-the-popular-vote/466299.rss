It has only one good effect. It allows you to vote on 3. party candidates in non-swing states without the spoiler effect. But that is sadly not much (Or anything). You can waste your vote because your vote is worthless, what a liberty.</p>

<p>We were also on top of hdi with a budget surplus. Thats long gone with the conservatives in power. What we got with the conservatives was cuts to social programs and cuts on corporation tax, and increase spending 40% probably mostly on war. We don’t act as a peace keeping nation anymore, we are one-with-isreal ready to do anything for them, we shut down the Iranian embassy and gave them 7 days to leave the country, now we can’t have diplomatic relations and solutions with Iran. This is all topped off with a huge deficit.</p>

              <p>Well I agree, but we actually have 3 parties that are about equal in the polls. And the parties have vast differences, unlike the republicans and democrats. Currently we have elected right wing conservatives, but NDP are social democratic party which are doing better than the cons in some polls. Maybe we’ll take back our title as the best country to live in (damn u norway)</p>
<p>which is another sidenote, we lost that title after electing the right wing.</p>

The problem is that you force people to support a party who would vote for something you are against. With more parties you wouldn’t be forced to vote on the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>In Canada this isn’t really a bad thing. It means that 54% voted for the opposition, or in other words, have given the opposition more power than the elected party.</p>
<p>Say for fun(this never happened), conservatives get 40%, liberals 30%, ndp 30%. Obviously the cons win but in the house of commons they only have 40% of the seats. Now say Cons make up this crazy extremist bill that everyone else is against, the libs and ndp could stop it because they have 60% of the seats and voting power.</p>
<p>The problem (if it is a problem?) is when the cons get 51%. Than they have the power to do as they wish, with 49% people unhappy. The opposition is totally powerless.</p>

<p>basically it was relevant when the country was founded but like lots of things in the constitution that were relevant then but the times have changed–and I can guarantee the founding fathers didn’t see all of this happening in the future but idk what they had in mind for the future of america but you know they had a great vision for our future–needs revision and amendments created.</p>

              <p>I also think it’s a bad system.</p>
<p>I didn’t watch the video, but here’s what I think:</p>
<p>It basically removes the reason for anyone to vote if they know they are in a state that usually votes the other party (for example, there’s no reason for a republican to vote on the president in California, or a Texan to vote if they are democratic), because their vote becomes worthless.</p>
<p>Like the title says, it doesn’t actually show who is overall more popular, just who is more popular in the popular states.</p>
<p>So really, does anyone know why we have this system? I don’t, and am too lazy to look it up <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
