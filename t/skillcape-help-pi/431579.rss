              <p>So the process you would need to go through is this:</p>
<p>[ul][li]When the player clicks the Npc[/li]<br>
[li]Check their current level for the skill[/li]<br>
[li]If the skill is 99, then allow the player to buy their cape[/li]<br>
[li]If not, tell the player.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>As for allowing players to wear it at level 1, if you make the items untradeable then no player without level 99 should have it.</p>
