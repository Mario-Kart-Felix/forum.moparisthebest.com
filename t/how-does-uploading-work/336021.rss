    <description>Hey guys I&#39;m new here and learning. I recently downloaded a source and a client. When I go to upload the client so others can join, is there anything i need to do to the client? I&#39;m saying this becuase I think every one downloads same client so me uploading it will do me no good. Please tell me if you don&#39;t under stand, and ty in advanced.</description>

<p>^That is correct sir.</p>
<p>mworld.no-ip.biz = someone elses server<br>
127.0.0.1 = That’s you, if you connect to that, you will connect to your server, but other people can’t connect to your server from that IP.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.no-ip.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">www.no-ip.com</a><br>
<a href="http://www.ipchicken.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">www.ipchicken.com</a></p>
<p>Find ur IP and ipchicken, sign up at <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a>, add new host, type in ur IP, get your no-ip and use it in ur client.</p>
<p>Sorry im in a rush lol</p>

              <p>You should find something like</p>
<p><code>System.out.println("Connecting to update server");
Serverip = "0.0.0.0";
sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName(Serverip));</code></p>
<p>Look for something similar to that.</p>

              <p>Client folder find gui.java. Open it up at press ctrl + f; look for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">serverip="</code></pre>
<p>There will be something inbetween those brackets. Usually 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1 or the person’s old server ip. Change it to the custom IP address that you have made and that will allow the people who downloaded your client to access your server.</p>
