    <title>Dicing Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dicing-problem/552408</link>
    <description>With a server that has about 20-30 constant players. There is an issue when it comes to dicing. It was a mistake to have it in the first place but now players are out of control with it, at least 10 people have quit and 2 or 3 have been banned. It&#39;s become a hassle for team members and the community alike. We can&#39;t just up and remove it because we feel some people will quit because of that, on the other hand if we keep it then people will continue to go all in and get cleaned. What are some solutions to this issue? Like, what would you do?</description>

<p>Do it like those gambling machines you get in a casino then! If the NPC has got 0 gp, the win rate for npc is 100%. The more money the NPC gains, the more chance a player may have of winning. That way you’re not adding no new money into game!</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That’s just evil. Giving the NPC a higher than 50% win rate and a betting cap (Could change dependent on positive gain), you will secure that it will win more in the long run and avoid betting tactics (doubling the bet each time). And I’m pretty sure that having a guaranteed 100% win rate for the machine at 0 money is illegal in real life.</p>
<p>52% win rate (for the house) would match games like roulette iirc.</p>

<p>This is a good idea. You could also make money sinks in the game that give the gp directly to the gambling NPC. If the NPC has no gp left he could say “I have no money left! Please come back later.” or something of that sort.</p>

Add an ip/user limit for number of times you can roll dice per time period? Make the dice degrade and require expensive repair costs (money sink) comparable to Barrows items?<br>
[/quote]<br>
I’d assume this would drive players away. All they need to do is hop to a new server that allows dicing and they can bet their 50b.[/quote]<br>
It would depend how it’s implemented honestly.<br>
Good implementation could mean players will stay.<br>
Bad implementation could mean players will quit because it ruined the point of dicing, or players will stay because it didn’t do anything serious to dicing.</p>

[/quote]<br>
The degrading is actually a good idea, but I’d think it would need to be a bit flexible based on how much the user had bet (Only if they bet over the initial cost).<br>
Ex: The initial cost to repair it would be 50m.<br>
Player A wins 50<span class="bbcode-b">b</span> before the dice degraded fully, so the repair cost increased to 15b.<br>
Player B only won 5m before their dice degraded, so it only cost them  the initial 50m.</p>
<p>Don’t know how you’d track it, since it’s all done via trading on most servers (If you made a custom ‘betting’ interface, it’d be easy to track)[/quote]<br>

              <p>Wrong section, should be general server disc.<br>
But anyways…</p>
<p>What do you mean it’s “become a problem”? Like some examples.<br>
People on RSPS will quit over anything. I have quit a server because they didn’t fix the run orb on their client (It’s literally just renaming a sprite in the cache…). People will also “rage quit” a lot. My source on that is I’ve owned a few servers in the past…<br>
Had a kid BEG to dice me everything he owned. I really, really didn’t want to do it. But he got on my nerves; so I did anyways. He traded it all over, and lost the dice game. I was gonna give most of it back (Considering as an owner I don’t need shit) but he quit. Literally just closed his client and never came back.<br>
Had another kid quit my server because he was losing in dice duels a lot. Not that he lost his bank or anything. He just didn’t as often as he believed he “should have” (Because you know, random numbers).</p>
<p>Ways to “help” it:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Pull a RuneScape - add a trade limit[/li]<br>
[li]Limit dicing to one contained zone - May not reduce the issue, but it will make the server look like it’s less about dicing (I’ve seen people turned off from servers due to everyone dicing and not pvp’ing/bossing).[/li]<br>
[li]Fix your economy by adding a money sink - What happens on servers where dicing gets big (for some fudgeing reason) is that somehow a lot of money just “shows up” into the economy. I played on a server that had like ~2b TOTAL coins, to ~500b in a night… Which only worsens the dicing because now people can make these outrageous bets, and some will rage quit upon losing them - or even scam.[/li]<br>
[li]Limit dicing to old members - This really only works if you saved the account creation date into the player files… But what you could do is make new accounts have a 1 week “Trial period” where dicing is off limits (I would not make players wait for dueling or trading, just dicing and other forms of gambling like it)[/li][/ul]</p>

              <p>With a server that has about 20-30 constant players. There is an issue when it comes to dicing. It was a mistake to have it in the first place but now players are out of control with it, at least 10 people have quit and 2 or 3 have been banned. It’s become a hassle for team members and the community alike. We can’t just up and remove it because we feel some people will quit because of that, on the other hand if we keep it then people will continue to go all in and get cleaned. What are some solutions to this issue? Like, what would you do?</p>
