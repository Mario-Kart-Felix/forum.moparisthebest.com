    <title>The Ultimate Truth of the client size...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-ultimate-truth-of-the-client-size/228007</link>
    <description>This is the ultimate question of truth tbh in so called &#39;coding&#39; so ill ask it.
Does the client.java/.class file really matter for higher efficiency, speed, and performance?
After myself testing, it came inconclusive as ive loaded my processes, filled with junk voids, added random chatblocks, heck even made 2 types of magic for npcs and pvp... Who did make this lie up or is it really true and my comp just owns? :P</description>

              <p>I can’t imagine the lag i was in on a 5 person server &gt;_&gt; crappy ram much? Anyways…<br>
I did test this with a high amount of players 80+ and we all reported ( but 1 ) of no lag and of having such a low ram, how is it possible to have the ‘no lag’?</p>

              <p>Well if that means what I think you’re trying to say, each player that connects creates a new thread, splitting the memory, and giving some to the new player. It will get to a point when the memory required to cycle through each players processing method at the speed required is higher then the memory available pretty quickly, due to the massive amounts of data it goes through each cycle for each player.<br>
So most servers will not take long at all to start lagging drastically when even low amounts of players are logged on.</p>

<p>It does matter. Each variable takes up memory. Each call to the stack takes up memory. In the processing methods, 1000s of calls to the stack are made each process on each player. Each of these takes up memory and CPU. If more of these have to be made, your server will run slower and slower.</p>

</aside>
<p>So when do you think this process of slowing the server will start to happen via amount of players do you think until it lags?</p>
<p>::EDIT:: Also by a standard computer say windows 1 gb ram?</p>
