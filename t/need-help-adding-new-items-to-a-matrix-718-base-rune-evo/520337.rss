    <title>Need help adding new items to a Matrix 718 base (Rune-Evo)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-adding-new-items-to-a-matrix-718-base-rune-evo/520337</link>
    <description>I downloaded this PS https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,600005.0.html

I&#39;ve added about 200 items to a Hybrid PvP source about 2 years ago, but completely forgotten how I did it, and from what I can tell, this 718 base&#39;s files are much different.

I had googled around for hours and can&#39;t find a way to do it.

Just want to know how to add an item, and add stats to it, as well as how to take a current item and recolour it and readd as a new item.

Thanks,
