    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-form-someone-experienced-with-compiling-and-or-jdk-please/304989</link>
    <description>Okay, I have tried numerous things to try get my client running, I have followed advice fomr amny people and spent 14 hours tryin to figure this out. When I try to compile; 

IT says;
Note: Some input files override a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint : deprecation for details.

How do I do that??

Also is there a command I can add to make my compiler find the JDK v6 update16 in my files? 
If so, where do I add it in aswell?

If someone has JDK V6 Update 16   , can you please send me what your &quot;CLASSPATH&quot; and &quot;Path&quot; are set to?
Also could I please have a copy of your compiler to try please? 

Thanks,

I will be greatful for any Information on the matter  :)</description>
