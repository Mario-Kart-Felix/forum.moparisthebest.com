    <description>Ok guys,teleports on my server are seriously screwed.I want to change the name they appear as

currently they are just appearing as normal like &quot;varrock teleport&quot; &quot;camelot teleport&quot;

ive searched all through my server files-nothing is there starting with those
ive searched through all my client files-changed them all-did not work

P.S does anyone have and links to tutorials on 1 connection per ip for delta base? I looked at the tutorial where u make a list but that doesnt seem to work as i cannot find the same things on delta as they have in the tutorial,if u know what i mean.Ty again. :D[br][br][size=1]Posted on: May 22, 2009, 11:48:34 pm[/size][hr]bump</description>
