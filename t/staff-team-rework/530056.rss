    <title>Staff Team Rework?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/staff-team-rework/530056</link>
    <description>So I made this post on Tree&#39;s thread, but it really doesn&#39;t belong there seeing as his is more about overall changes to the forum as a whole and mine is more direct.



[u]The problem:[/u]
   Lack of moderation in some sections. Staff position viewed  (and in some cases actually treated) as an award instead of a volunteer position (for example, there is no reason section moderators in their current state should have a &#39;moparscape moderator&#39; badge. They do not have any power at all in other sections of the forum, and the award is misleading).

[u]My proposed solution:[/u]

[ul]  [li]Migrate to a more sectional moderator based system. No visible award except in section. Able to warn and moderate users[i] for offenses in that section[/i] (the ability to warn/moderate is all debatable, not dependant on whether this actually goes through. I do recognize that ability to warn for only offenses in their section would need a SMF mod and as such probably unrealistic). Much larger number, probably 1-5 [i]per section[/i] depending on the sections activity.[/li]
  [li]Much smaller number of global moderators (I was thinking 5-7). Deal with the occasional forum spammer, people that really need mutes, etc. I personally feel like this number of admins (3-4) is fine.[/li]
   [li]All staff are required to be active or they should step down, but they can easily return if they feel like being active again.[/li]
   [li]Discussions are more open with the community to increase the marketplace of ideas. This works well with the community suggestions board. Sectionals would not have access to &#39;staff&#39; discussions, and have hardly any more weight in the public ones than a normal user. Of course staff (globals/admins) still make the final call and have their own private discussions as well.[/li][/ul]


Sectional moderator can be an opt-in position, much less selective. You remove almost all of the &#39;perks&#39; and it seems more like a volunteer job instead of an award, so the people that apply are the ones that actually want to help, rather than ones that want the awards. 

I&#39;ve always agreed with MITB that having inactive staff doesn&#39;t [i]hurt[/i] the forum, but it does change the whole dynamic of the staff team if it appears like you &#39;earn&#39; a staff position and then you don&#39;t have to actually do anything once you get it (also just applies to those with blasé attitudes). I see nothing wrong with a post saying &quot;Today we say goodbye to ___ from our staff team while s/he takes some time off, but would like to welcome ___ in to help fill the gap!&quot;</description>

<p>It would be great if we had another sectional or two for Server Help and the Advertising sections.</p>

              <p>I agree and disagree with some of this. The idea of lowering the numbers of global’s seems redundant. If they do a fine job, why remove them? If they’re worthy of the role, why ignore this fact due to a larger number of staff? I’m sure that there’s a good amount of reports that need to be handled throughout the day, and I’m sure they rack up even with the amount of staff Mopar has now. This community is large enough to have a large number of staff, but that doesn’t mean go out and promote wildly. I think the number of staff is completely irrelevant to the task at hand.</p>
<p>I agree somewhat with the activity of staff. Staff should be active, or they cannot perform their role. It’s a simple concept. Though, I think that 1 month may be too little - perhaps a half year would be a tad more lenient.</p>
<p>I agree with more sectionals, however. Most of the global mods seem to be inactive enough to let reports rack up quite often. With the increase of sectionals, the problem may dim more. I think that we at least need two sectionals for every section, the ones that are more active at least. With the new promotion of amy, I think that problems with that specific section may no longer be problems, or they’ll at least die off some.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t sectionals be allowed in the staff discussion? They’re apart of the team, yes? They may play a small part in the team, but they’re still in it. I don’t see the logic behind removing them from staff discussions, honestly.</p>

I don’t see any reason for this. Globals are good to have especially for post reports. I can’t think of any reason to demote any of our globals. I think any sectional who does an exceptional job over the test of time should be promoted to global (with their consent)[/quote]The main reason for this is just to have a clear staff decorum and list. IE - You know who the active staff members are at any point in time, and that if you message any of them they will respond relatively quickly. You could increase that number from 7 to 10 or 20, but I honestly think staff being active is fairly important.</p>

<p>[/quote]<br>
Just how active must they be? Do you mean long-term inactive, or just generally not very active?[/quote](Note: when I say active I mean in terms of doing moderator actions, not just posting etc) That would be up for debate. The idea is that if they knew they were going to be long-term (I’d say thats 1+ month) inactive, they would inform the rest of the team and step down (similar to what Ruby did today), and be replaced by someone else. That ‘someone else’ would probably be a sectional, or a global that had stepped down previously and was willing to be active again. Short term inactivity, you’d still want to inform the team, but no other actions would really need to take place unless many of them were going to be inactive at once.</p>

I just don’t feel people are doing it for the badge. Most moderators are long time members and I believe they have love for the community. Everyone wants this place to succeed. But people come people go, some slow down.[/quote]That’s not what I was implying, it’s just that if the team becomes stagnant with staff that are active (in terms of posting) but not so much in doing moderator duties, it can be difficult to decide whether or not you actually need more staff members.</p>

<p>I agree on the visible award unless they have a more descriptive one if it must display all the time. Which is nearly impossible for some boards. I’m all for more sectionals, it’s a good way to start off. Surely in rsps related sites our staff must have the cleanest record and we should keep it that way. They do need real powers in their respective section otherwise it’s pointless.</p>

<p>To use myself for example I don’t spend much time here and when I do its just the general section etc. I may go on some activity sprees however its pretty rare for me to even do post reports but sometimes I do, and if I come in and do 15 reports that’s 15 less that anyone else has to do. Others are like me and those numbers add up.</p>
<p>Even with the long-term inactive there is still no real benefit demoting them. Most actually just resign but if there comes a time to demote inactive staff, I think it should be a good extended period of time something over 1year+ or higher yet. They would be free to return but what was the point in leaving staff in the first place?</p>

what would more mods do?<br>
at first: rule-enforce-rampage (<span class="bbcode-i">like when deathschaos9 became staff</span>)<br>
after a bit of time: same old loop cycle where nobody does anything for 19 hours of the day except skim through general/irc, and then someone like si force hops on an solves a dozen or more reports.<br>
then’d we be in the same boat, or we can just keep repeating until <span class="bbcode-u">everyone</span> is a moderator; then nobody can break rules!!!1</p>

              <p>[quote=“Arcik, post:4, topic:530056”]I think we should have like after a thread gets reported x amount of times for it to automatically be locked then reviewed by a staff member. I guess that would make their lives easier?[/quote]Main problem there is I’ve noticed a lot of the time people just flat out don’t report topics, they just post ‘this isnt allowed’ or something, thinking the mods will find it automatically. It’s an interest idea but I dont think it will really help that much. It also doesn’t help the smaller sections where maybe not as many people will see it to report it anyways.</p>
