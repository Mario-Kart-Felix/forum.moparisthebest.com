<p>[ul]  [li]Migrate to a more sectional moderator based system. No visible award except in section. Able to warn and moderate users<span class="bbcode-i"> for offenses in that section</span> (the ability to warn/moderate is all debatable, not dependant on whether this actually goes through. I do recognize that ability to warn for only offenses in their section would need a SMF mod and as such probably unrealistic). Much larger number, probably 1-5 <span class="bbcode-i">per section</span> depending on the sections activity.[/li][/ul]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I agree on the visible award unless they have a more descriptive one if it must display all the time. Which is nearly impossible for some boards. I’m all for more sectionals, it’s a good way to start off. Surely in rsps related sites our staff must have the cleanest record and we should keep it that way. They do need real powers in their respective section otherwise it’s pointless.</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:1, topic:530056”]<br>
[ul][li]Much smaller number of global moderators (I was thinking 5-7). Deal with the occasional forum spammer, people that really need mutes, etc. I personally feel like this number of admins (3-4) is fine.[/li][/ul][/quote]<br>
I don’t see any reason for this. Globals are good to have especially for post reports. I can’t think of any reason to demote any of our globals. I think any sectional who does an exceptional job over the test of time should be promoted to global (with their consent)</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:1, topic:530056”]<br>
[ul][li]All staff are required to be active or they should step down, but they can easily return if they feel like being active again.[/li][/ul][/quote]<br>
Just how active must they be? Do you mean long-term inactive, or just generally not very active?</p>
<p>To use myself for example I don’t spend much time here and when I do its just the general section etc. I may go on some activity sprees however its pretty rare for me to even do post reports but sometimes I do, and if I come in and do 15 reports that’s 15 less that anyone else has to do. Others are like me and those numbers add up.</p>
<p>Even with the long-term inactive there is still no real benefit demoting them. Most actually just resign but if there comes a time to demote inactive staff, I think it should be a good extended period of time something over 1year+ or higher yet. They would be free to return but what was the point in leaving staff in the first place?</p>

I think any sectional who does an exceptional job over the test of time should be promoted to global (with their consent)[/quote]The main reason for this is just to have a clear staff decorum and list. IE - You know who the active staff members are at any point in time, and that if you message any of them they will respond relatively quickly. You could increase that number from 7 to 10 or 20, but I honestly think staff being active is fairly important.</p>

<p>[/quote]<br>
Just how active must they be? Do you mean long-term inactive, or just generally not very active?[/quote](Note: when I say active I mean in terms of doing moderator actions, not just posting etc) That would be up for debate. The idea is that if they knew they were going to be long-term (I’d say thats 1+ month) inactive, they would inform the rest of the team and step down (similar to what Ruby did today), and be replaced by someone else. That ‘someone else’ would probably be a sectional, or a global that had stepped down previously and was willing to be active again. Short term inactivity, you’d still want to inform the team, but no other actions would really need to take place unless many of them were going to be inactive at once.</p>

This just sounds like a bad idea to me but an interesting concept.[/quote]Perks are just the badge in other sections (already been removed) and being a part of important staff discussions. The idea just being you don’t need to be as selective when it comes to choosing sectionals.</p>

        <p>I agree and disagree with some of this. The idea of lowering the numbers of global’s seems redundant. If they do a fine job, why remove them? If they’re worthy of the role, why ignore this fact due to a larger number of staff? I’m sure that there’s a good amount of reports that need to be handled throughout the day, and I’m sure they rack up even with the amount of staff Mopar has now. This community is large enough to have a large number of staff, but that doesn’t mean go out and promote wildly. I think the number of staff is completely irrelevant to the task at hand.</p>
<p>I agree somewhat with the activity of staff. Staff should be active, or they cannot perform their role. It’s a simple concept. Though, I think that 1 month may be too little - perhaps a half year would be a tad more lenient.</p>
<p>I agree with more sectionals, however. Most of the global mods seem to be inactive enough to let reports rack up quite often. With the increase of sectionals, the problem may dim more. I think that we at least need two sectionals for every section, the ones that are more active at least. With the new promotion of amy, I think that problems with that specific section may no longer be problems, or they’ll at least die off some.</p>
<p>Why wouldn’t sectionals be allowed in the staff discussion? They’re apart of the team, yes? They may play a small part in the team, but they’re still in it. I don’t see the logic behind removing them from staff discussions, honestly.</p>

Right now it’s very selective, which is why we hardly have any. The reason it’s so selective is because of the different things you get out of it, such as being considered part of the ‘staff team’, and the badge (again that was just removed). Lower the requirements, lower the ‘rewards’, make it more of a volunteer job rather for people that want to help get rid of spam</p>

<p>It would be great if we had another sectional or two for Server Help and the Advertising sections.</p>
