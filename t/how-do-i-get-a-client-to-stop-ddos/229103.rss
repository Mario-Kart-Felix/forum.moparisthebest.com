    <title>How do i get a client to stop ddos?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-get-a-client-to-stop-ddos/229103</link>
    <description>I have been DDoS&#39;d too many times today. Is there a way I can still use Allstar scape but, make the players use a client without giving out the ip? This way I can stop DDoS attacks.. 

Summary: I want to download a client that has the IP embedded and then still use my Allstar scape.


Thanks.</description>

              <p>he also needs to close the source after because if not you can just open client.java and search for setserver and they will find the ip.</p>
