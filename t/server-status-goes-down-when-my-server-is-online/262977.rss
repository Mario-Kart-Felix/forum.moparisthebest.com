    <title>Server Status % goes down when my server is online</title>

    <description>[b]I have done this serveral times on different days, so it&#39;s not just a one off:[/b]

I have been playing on my Server for a few hours now, and people were coming and going for a while but then I noticed that people stopped coming on and there were only a few people left. I thought this was weird because it had only restarted a couple of times to reduce lagg. I checked the Server Status page and couldn&#39;t find my server, so I manually typed it in. When it loaded it showed that my server&#39;s uptime was 67% which was [b]highly frustrating[/b] because I know full well it only went off a few times for a split second when it restarted.

I was wondering if there was anyway of making my server stay at 100% on the server status list because otherwise I have to wait for it to drop below 40% and then re-submit it. This means there are hardly any people on my server because no one knows it even exists :/.

It could potentially be a 24/7 server but after a short while it goes below 80%, and no one searches for servers past the second page so I would have no chance of anyone coming on my server, so I would be wasting my time leaving it on 24/7.


Any help please? :(</description>
