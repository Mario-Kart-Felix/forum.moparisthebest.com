    <title>Mouse was controlled by Screen stealer, through SCAR software!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mouse-was-controlled-by-screen-stealer-through-scar-software/20422</link>
    <description>Hey

The 1st time I downloaded SCAR, I downloaded a program called &#39;Fl4x0r&#39; 
Which automatically picks flax while I&#39;m AFK.

As I downloaded SCAR and added the script to it (I downloaded the script via a ZIP file)
The mouse began to move on its own, It seemed as though it was hovering towards &#39;My computer&#39;
I quickly struggled with this screen Hi-jacker over the mouse, and managed to disable the SCAR software;
Thus ending the screen hi-jackers fun.

I wanted to know, Is this the program SCAR&#39;s general way of greetings new users, by Hi-jacking them?
Or was it merely the script which I downloaded?

Could it possibly have been the script working?

Please reply as I am curious to know before I attempt to Re-download SCAR and give it another chance :P

I think it&#39;s also worth mentioning I am sort of a Newbie in the field or Runescape Scripting, So go slow :D</description>
