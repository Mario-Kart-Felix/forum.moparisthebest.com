    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-experienced-person-508-portforwarding-problem/354664</link>
    <description>okay, so i have a netgear router, and everytime i try to portforward i get my friends to try and connect but they never can. i have a Sky Router Netgear DG834GT, and i just cannot get my server online, i have tried alot of things but it&#39;s just not happening. i have tried utorrent, but same thing- doesn&#39;t connect, yes i put the port as 43594, and my no-ip DUC is active but it&#39;s still not working. i can get it online on hamachi, but who wants a hamachi server? if you think you can help me please post below. i have been coding this alot lately and dont feel like making it a waste of time. if it helps, im using a client my friend uses to run his server off (508-ipchanger).

i have teamviewer if u could help or just reply here PLEASE!!, if you like i can give u staff position on my server if you help me fix this problem!!</description>
