    <description>Issue 1:
Upon a NPC dying, it will start to show the death animation and then completely stop and disappear.
[hr]
Issue 2:
When a player kills another player, when the killed player respawns, the player who killed the dead player will face towards the dead player. It should face towards the player it just killed.
[hr]
Issue 3:
When you are in the wilderness and you can see another player (whether the player is in the wilderness or outside of the wilderness does not matter) your hover-over text will start to switch very fast from &#39;Attack PLAYERNAME (level-126) / 3 more options&#39; to &#39;Walk here PLAYERNAME (level-126) / 2 more options&#39;. Here&#39;s a GIF to show you what it looks like and how much of a pest it could be:

How can I fix [i]any[/i] of these? Thanks :)</description>

<p>Issue 1:</p>
<p>Change the respawn timer to something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (isDead()) {

                        hiddenTimer--;

                        if (hiddenTimer &lt;= 0 &amp;&amp; isVisible) {

                                needsRespawn = true;

                                isVisible = false;

                                getUpdateFlags().setUpdateRequired(true);

                        }

                        if (respawnTimer &lt;= 0 &amp;&amp; !isVisible &amp;&amp; needsRespawn) {

                                setPosition(spawnPosition);

                                isVisible = true;

                                setDead(false);</code></pre>
<p>Issue 2: I’m not sure what your asking.</p>
