    <title>I&#39;m coming out of the Broom Closet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-coming-out-of-the-broom-closet/25162</link>
    <description>For those who don&#39;t know what the title means, it means I am coming forward with my true religion, Wicca. I have felt like this since as long as I could remember, but always ignored it. I have converted my religion from Baptist Chrisitanity, and until now have only told my closest friends. I figure, this forum is a big part of my life I should let you all know. I know that I&#39;m in for a lot of hate and critiscism from close minded people, but I think that people should know, and hopefully people will understand. Wicca is the practice of witchcraft, it is NOT at all related with satanism(devil worshipping) I do not believe in forced love spells, hexes, anything that will control people. This isn&#39;t only because it is morally wrong to do so but also because of the Wiccan rede, which I have copied for you

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wiccan Rede
Bide within the Law you must, in perfect Love and perfect Trust.
Live you must and let to live, fairly take and fairly give.

For tread the Circle thrice about to keep unwelcome spirits out.
To bind the spell well every time, let the spell be said in rhyme.

Light of eye and soft of touch, speak you little, listen much.
Honor the Old Ones in deed and name,
let love and light be our guides again.

Deosil go by the waxing moon, chanting out the joyful tune.
Widdershins go when the moon doth wane,
and the werewolf howls by the dread wolfsbane.

When the Lady&#39;s moon is new, kiss the hand to Her times two.
When the moon rides at Her peak then your heart&#39;s desire seek.

Heed the North winds mighty gale, lock the door and trim the sail.
When the Wind blows from the East, expect the new and set the feast.

When the wind comes from the South, love will kiss you on the mouth.
When the wind whispers from the West, all hearts will find peace and rest.

Nine woods in the Cauldron go, burn them fast and burn them slow.
Birch in the fire goes to represent what the Lady knows.

Oak in the forest towers with might, in the fire it brings the God&#39;s
insight.   Rowan is a tree of power causing life and magick to flower.

Willows at the waterside stand ready to help us to the Summerland.
Hawthorn is burned to purify and to draw faerie to your eye.

Hazel-the tree of wisdom and learning adds its strength to the bright fire burning.
White are the flowers of Apple tree that brings us fruits of fertility.

Grapes grow upon the vine giving us both joy and wine.
Fir does mark the evergreen to represent immortality seen.

Elder is the Lady&#39;s tree burn it not or cursed you&#39;ll be.
Four times the Major Sabbats mark in the light and in the dark.

As the old year starts to wane the new begins, it&#39;s now Samhain.
When the time for Imbolc shows watch for flowers through the snows.

When the wheel begins to turn soon the Beltane fires will burn.
As the wheel turns to Lamas night power is brought to magick rite.

Four times the Minor Sabbats fall use the Sun to mark them all.
When the wheel has turned to Yule light the log the Horned One rules.

In the spring, when night equals day time for Ostara to come our way.
When the Sun has reached it&#39;s height time for Oak and Holly to fight.

Harvesting comes to one and all when the Autumn Equinox does fall.
Heed the flower, bush, and tree by the Lady blessed you&#39;ll be.

Where the rippling waters go cast a stone, the truth you&#39;ll know.
When you have and hold a need, harken not to others greed.

With a fool no season spend or be counted as his friend.
Merry Meet and Merry Part bright the cheeks and warm the heart.

Mind the Three-fold Laws you should three times bad and three times good.
When misfortune is enow wear the star upon your brow.

Be true in love this you must do unless your love is false to you.

These Eight words the Rede fulfill:

&quot;An Ye Harm None, Do What Ye Will&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


As you can see, the rede says that whatever you do comes back to you threefold, so to cast something like a pain spell, would not only be morally wrong, but physically dangerous. This doesn&#39;t really change me much in any way, just my faith. Thanks for reading.

<p>Sounds suspicious, I’d better report this to the CIA as a communist neo-nazi threat with a possibility of Donald Trump eating a bannana.</p>
<p>But seriously, this sounds a lot like old norse paganism to me.  Is this some kind of neo-paganism cult?</p>

</aside>
<p>Dreamers incense? <img src="http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/6549/cccmi9.gif" alt width="" height="">[/quote] Ok, I’m not sure what a dreamers incense is but I’m gonna google it.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 16, 2006, 07:30:26 PM[/size][hr]Heres another:</p>
<blockquote>This is a self-esteem building ritual, with a focus on attitudes towards hair (or lack of it), but hair need not be the focus.
<p>I will be using several symbols to represent longer concepts. Here they are:<br>
! an important point</p>
<ul>
<li>optional, but desirable<br>
{ } preferred brand or etc. (my choice, you don’t have to use it)<br>
[ ] a substitute<br>
D deosil or clockwise<br>
" " spoken out loud</li>
</ul>
<p>Supplies (! this is in addition to whatever you need for your normal circle)</p>
<p>Chamomile (health food stores, also in the “tea” section)<br>
*lemon juice<br>
*salt<br>
Shampoo (try to get one with organic herbs)<br>
Oil (olive oil [or hair oil] )<br>
Candle (*beeswax [any candle] )<br>
Brush [washcloth or loofah if hair is short or bald]</p>
<p>TO DO NOW…</p>
<p>Put some chamomile flowers in {olive} oil, in a sealed bottle, and let sit for as long as you can (days). strain out flowers before ritual and put oil in a container for use during the ritual… use this when the ritual calls for Oil. [ you may substitute any vegetable oil, or any hair oil, as needed]</p>
<p>! Make sure you save some chamomile to make tea with (you will need at least one teacup worth per person, or about one tablespoon)</p>
<p>Assemble a good brush [or a rough washcloth, or loofah], all your favorite shower supplies, and some good clothes for the ritual. (Good clothes, meaning clothes that make you feel good about yourself.)</p>
<p>! This is the time to splurge a bit… buy a small bottle of that expensive perfume/cologne, if you like it… get the expensive hair stuff…buy a really indulgent nightie/boxers to wear, whatever…</p>
<p>BEFORE THE RITUAL<br>
Up to one day before… but by preference, do it right before…</p>
<p>Arrange to take a bath or shower in a leisurely fashion<br>
(ok, hire a babysitter if you have to)</p>
<p>Using your favorite shampoo, and a luxurious soap, take a hedonistic bath or shower. Use the loofah, and be comfortable.<br>
*Oil treat your hair, by using the OIL on your hair (slightly warm) and then washing it out. (Save some for anointing the candle.)<br>
*Try to pour chamomile tea, or diluted lemon juice over your head at least once (as a purification).<br>
*Rinse with chamomile tea if possible.<br>
*Dry hair enough to brush.</p>
<p>You should be concentrating on feeling good, and enjoying yourself… try to be positive.</p>
<p>RITUAL<br>
! make sure you read through this, and have all your supplies ready and in place!</p>
<p>Walk around your circle D, [or turn in place], visualizing a pure white light surrounding your sacred space (or cast the circle as you would normally).<br>
“This circle stands outside the world and time,<br>
and brings us to this sacred space sublime.<br>
From whence and where we come withstanding not,<br>
I stand within with my compatriots.<br>
This circle cast that all of us may see,<br>
The power raised within, SO MOTE IT BE!”</p>
<p>Starting in the North or East, as suits your tradition, call the quarters proceeding D. (Make sure you return to the position you started in.)</p>
<p>North<br>
“I call upon the element of Earth,<br>
to heal in me the knowledge of my worth.”</p>
<p>East<br>
“I call upon the element of Air,<br>
the image of my self to thus repair.”</p>
<p>South<br>
“I call upon the element of Fire<br>
to confidence and strength in me inspire.”</p>
<p>West<br>
" I call upon the element of Water,<br>
to let me see things clearly as I ought to."</p>
<p>Center<br>
“I call upon the element unspoken,<br>
that what has healed, shall never more be broken!”</p>
<p>Anoint the candle with Oil, concentrating on your desire.</p>
<p>Light the Ritual Candle<br>
“Sweet the smell of beeswax, [Sacred is the Candle wax]<br>
burning in the flame.<br>
beautiful within the glow,<br>
of fire that is tame.<br>
Like the glowing candleflame,<br>
the light of beauty shine,<br>
and bring to all within your glow,<br>
the peace of the divine.”</p>
<p>*Sit, stand, or walk around D, and use a power raising chant<br>
I suggest:<br>
“She changes everything she touches, and everything she touches changes”<br>
or</p>
<ul>
<li>“We are the flow and we are the ebb, we are the weavers we are the web”</li>
</ul>
<p>Get out your brush [washcloth/ loofah] and sit or stand brushing your hair [rubbing your scalp] (you may use any oil left over to anoint your head).</p>
<p>Make your request. (! be specific)<br>
Here are several variations for different purposes…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>“Earth, and Water, Fire and Air,<br>
grant me long and flowing hair!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Wind and Water, Fire and Earth,<br>
grant me Joy, and Love, and Mirth!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Air and Water, Earth and Fire,<br>
confidence in me inspire!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Earth and Fire, Air and Water,<br>
Look with favor on your daughter!”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat that until you feel you are heard, then:</p>
<p>“I am the child of the Gods,<br>
I am the sister [brother] to the spirits,<br>
Within me are the elements contained.<br>
As there is beauty in the Gods,<br>
As there is beauty in the spirits,<br>
By the power of the elements ordained:<br>
I grow more beautiful within,<br>
I grow more beautiful without,<br>
Until perfection of the spirit is attained!”</p>
<p>Repeat until you are tired of brushing your hair.</p>
<p>You may extinguish the candle, or leave it to burn out (in a fireproof dish!).</p>
<p>Bid the elements farewell:</p>
<p>North<br>
“Depart with thanks the element of Earth,<br>
that healed in me the knowledge of my worth.”</p>
<p>East<br>
“Depart with thanks the element of Air,<br>
whose gentle breeze my wounded self, repaired.”</p>
<p>South<br>
“Depart with thanks the element of Fire<br>
that confidence and strength in me inspired.”</p>
<p>West<br>
“Depart with thanks the element of Water,<br>
that let me see things clearly, as I ought to.”</p>
<p>Center<br>
“Depart with thanks, the element unspoken,<br>
that what has healed, shall never more be broken!”</p>
<p>Open the circle:</p>
<p>“This circle that without the world and time,<br>
has brought us to this sacred space sublime.<br>
From whence and where we come withstanding not,<br>
I stood within with my compatriots,<br>
Is now and shall forever be unbroken,<br>
but now our gath’ring ends, and it is Open!”</p>
<p>Have some food and chamomile tea to ground.</p>

<p>I doubt many of the ignorants who claim to be Wiccan have enough knowledge to make any religious choice at all, especially one that directs them into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_psychology" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Jungian</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tilt/principia/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Discordian</a> view of the world.</p>

<p>ahhaha now no one laugh, but my first spell i did was because all i needed was a bowl of water. It was a money spell which i did because it was so easy. here, ill just post the spell:</p>
<p>Take a dish of water into the Moonlight, catch the Moon’s reflection on the water and dip your hands into the water. Leave this on the hands until they dry and you shall receive money from an unexpected source within 28 days. This spell should be performed during the waxing moon.</p>
<p>I got $5.85 in a check from <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a>, when i did it in july, and got it in nov. 7th when i should have got it in august, it doesnt take two months to mail something from cali to fl, i wasn’t expecting the money at all, then i got it, and was like SWEET!</p>

              <p>I personally don’t believe in magic, or the point in belieiving in it but, meh, you make your own choices and I fully support you.<br>
I have yet to find my religion, so I am currently of no religion, but based on the info on Wicca you gave us, I think that jsut might be my religion too  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I, too like it because of the good nature, lol. But I’m not sure. I’m definitely not Christian, and I’ve yet to try Catholic or Baptist, but there is a good chance that I will turn out to be Wicca   <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Note: I still don’t believe in magic, I need <span class="bbcode-i">proof</span> that magic exists.</p>
