        <p>what people look for in a server varies so try focusing on a particular type of server e.g pvp server, skilling server or a hangout server<br>
noone likes those boring servers that you can just attain items etc in like 2 mins of starting the game so give them a bit of a challenge but not so hard that they will want to quit <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Learn how to make customs and make them available by killing a monster or obtained by a minigame and things like that… be inventive u may suprise yourself <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
hope this helped,</p>

        <p>It probably sucks. If you want heaps of players, make it decent, make it something that people will like and that hasn’t been seen before. The only reason people don’t like to play servers you guys run is because they are all the same, add random mini games that you can think of and make sure it’s a decent mini game so people will actually play it and stay for a while. I’ve also noticed, if you have more players online other people will stay, so of course you won’t get players if there is only a few online. If the server is decent, you might actually get people. Another reason people don’t stay is because most of the servers around are very unstable, which is why you need to remove a lot of stuff and basically rewrite everything that’s needed, like player vs player and NPC combat.</p>
<p>If you’re going to try get a good amount of players you will need a computer that can handle that server and a certain amount of players, which I recommend you use a VPS and not host the server off your computer so you can keep it 24/7. I also recommend you do <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> create custom items or NPCs for your server, this just ruins the whole server, and for the people that it takes 3 hours to download a client and then they find out the server is a pile of junk. Don’t make it so you need a certain client to connect, and if you do then I suggest you use a client that is clean, decent, and less than 10MB, even a 317 deob that JaydenD12 posted would be great to use.</p>
<p>Make skills hard but not too hard to train, so you don’t get 99 in a minute, around 20*skill level EXP per hit or you can even do 100 EXP per damage (1=100, 2=200, 3=300) these type of servers seem to last because people don’t get 99 skills immediately. Another thing people like in servers is skills like thieving, herblore, runecrafting, etc. People also do like servers where it’s easy to get some good items to get started off with, but hard to get dragon armor or party hats, and a Jad mini game where you can get a fire cape is also fun IMO <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’ve tried to create a fun server many times, and this is just about every suggestion I’ve gotten from the players that have stayed at my servers.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’ve always hated customs. I’ll try doing that. I’ll make a decent starter, and make a few NPC’s or minigames that’ll drop something the people will like.</p>
<p>But for the part where people only play servers that have a lot of players, how can I avoid this?</p>

        <p>some customs are alright such as vls and stat hammer, but i wouldn’t add anything else because it ruins the server.</p>
<p>you could make them powerfull but really hard to obtain… tbh, as the other 2 said, think what other servers have and think what your server can have if you think about it. Make it TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</p>
