    <title>I need a few tips on how to get a decent amount of players?</title>

    <description>Lately my server hasn&#39;t seen many players. Since I have no idea why, I&#39;ve decided as a last resort to ask how to get a decent amount of players? Usually if I advertise with all the server-status lists I know, I can only get like 5 people on. No, I&#39;m not going to spam servers with Laz&#39;s flooder etc. Even if that does work, it&#39;s incredibly annoying to the other server and will probably result in them attempting to crash my server.</description>

<p>you could make them powerfull but really hard to obtain… tbh, as the other 2 said, think what other servers have and think what your server can have if you think about it. Make it TOTALLY DIFFERENT.</p>

It probably sucks. If you want heaps of players, make it decent, make it something that people will like and that hasn’t been seen before. The only reason people don’t like to play servers you guys run is because they are all the same, add random mini games that you can think of and make sure it’s a decent mini game so people will actually play it and stay for a while. I’ve also noticed, if you have more players online other people will stay, so of course you won’t get players if there is only a few online. If the server is decent, you might actually get people. Another reason people don’t stay is because most of the servers around are very unstable, which is why you need to remove a lot of stuff and basically rewrite everything that’s needed, like player vs player and NPC combat.</p>
<p>If you’re going to try get a good amount of players you will need a computer that can handle that server and a certain amount of players, which I recommend you use a VPS and not host the server off your computer so you can keep it 24/7. I also recommend you do <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> create custom items or NPCs for your server, this just ruins the whole server, and for the people that it takes 3 hours to download a client and then they find out the server is a pile of junk. Don’t make it so you need a certain client to connect, and if you do then I suggest you use a client that is clean, decent, and less than 10MB, even a 317 deob that JaydenD12 posted would be great to use.</p>
<p>Make skills hard but not too hard to train, so you don’t get 99 in a minute, around 20*skill level EXP per hit or you can even do 100 EXP per damage (1=100, 2=200, 3=300) these type of servers seem to last because people don’t get 99 skills immediately. Another thing people like in servers is skills like thieving, herblore, runecrafting, etc. People also do like servers where it’s easy to get some good items to get started off with, but hard to get dragon armor or party hats, and a Jad mini game where you can get a fire cape is also fun IMO <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’ve tried to create a fun server many times, and this is just about every suggestion I’ve gotten from the players that have stayed at my servers.<br>
