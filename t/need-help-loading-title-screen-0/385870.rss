    <title>Need help- &quot;loading title screen -0%&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-loading-title-screen-0/385870</link>
    <description>Hi, I am currently working on coding a 614 server just for something fun to do in my spare time. I can get the server to run fine, but when I open up the client from run.bat, the client gets stuck on &quot;loading title screen - 0%&quot;.
[URL=http://img695.imageshack.us/i/captureif.png/][IMG]http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/9981/captureif.png[/img][/URL]

 I have tried changing the ip from 127.0.0.1 to localhost or my no-ip server name (for now i do not need to worry about other people playing the server, i just want to be able to play it to test things), just to see if it could be an IP connection problem, but still the same thing happens.
I read on the forums somewhere that this is a cache problem, but it was never really explained how it could be fixed. I renamed the cache folders to what the source seems to be looking for (from cache614 to revengescapecache), and still, the same problem happens. Does anyone know a fix to this problem?

Additional Info:
I do not have a signlink.java file, however its probably just renamed something different.</description>

              <p>Could anyone help? Still not fixed the problem, and I noticed other people are having this probem with 614s, I have the cache in C:/, the source, the client, and the cache auto-installs if it’s not in the correct place. Does the cache possibly have the wrong files? if so, how could this be fixed?</p>

              <p>haha lol i put my words wrong, if there is a folder called Cache click it, after that copy and paste your folder to where your client takes your cache from, in this case where all the caches are located /C: something liek that</p>

              <p>I performed a search for signlink.java and it couldnt find any files. Is this a file for earlier revisions? Also, about half of the source’s files were just decompiled and not given names, so instead of maybe loginmanager.java or something it’s class(random number).java</p>

              <p>yes it is probobly a cache problem, go<br>
into signlink.java and find the cache, sometimes you maybe have to place the cache that you got from your Client into your cache folder</p>
