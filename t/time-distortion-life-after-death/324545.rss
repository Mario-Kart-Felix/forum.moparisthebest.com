    <title>Time Distortion &amp; Life After Death</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/time-distortion-life-after-death/324545</link>
    <description>This is a theory I&#39;ve read about involving the perception of time and reincarnation. I do not take credit for this theory, but simply find it so fascinating that it must be shared. The words below, while comprised from the thoughts of others, are entirely my own.

Let&#39;s begin with the theory of time distortion. What is it? Time distortion is the idea that both our current physical and mental states alter how we perceive the passing of time. During easy and fun activities, an actual hour may feel like only a few minutes, while during strenuous or dull activities that same hour may seem to have lasted for multiple hours. To put things in common terms, &quot;time flies when you&#39;re having fun.&quot;

Another cliché ideology to explain this concept is the fact that as you get older, time seems to go by faster. There are many ways to explain this phenomena, my personal favourite being mathematically. It&#39;s pretty simple, really. When you&#39;re only 10 years old, a year seems to last an eternity. Why? Because at only 10 years of age, a single year accounts for 10% of your entire life span, 25% of which you may not even consciously remember. As you grow older, a year accounts for less and less of your life span, making each measurement of time account for less in the perception of your mind. When you&#39;re 50, a year only accounts for 2% of your entire life. So, in theory, time seems to pass almost 500% faster when you&#39;re 50 years old than it does at the age of 10.

One last example of time distortion before I digress: dreaming. For the biological/psychological nuts out there, dreaming occurs in a stage of sleep called R.E.M. (rapid eye movement) sleep, a stage of sleep that occurs approximately 4 times during the average human sleeping cycle, each occurrence lasting approximately 15 minutes. During R.E.M. sleep your eyes are constantly moving underneath your shut eyelids, you often have minor muscle jolts and it has been shown that electrical activity increases in the brain. It is commonly accepted by psychologists that R.E.M. sleep is used as an aid in forming new neurological bonds, in essence aiding in the creation of memories and associations. This is why it is common that you dream about the most recent thing that was on your mind before you fell asleep or about something out of the ordinary that happened to you that day.

However, I digress from the science behind it and move into the philosophical aspect. To summarize, R.E.M. sleep stages occur an average of 4 times during the average human sleep cycle and last approximately 15 minutes each, this is when dreaming occurs. Now, think about the last dream you had. How long was the plot? How many times did it appear to jump from one random story to another? You know, one moment you&#39;re in bed with the hottest girl on the block and right as you&#39;re about to take her bra off you&#39;re suddenly running from a zombie horde (FFFFFUUUUU!!!!!). The significance behind this is that even though your dreams may have seemed to lasted for hours and hours, you only actually dream for around an hour a night. This hour is split into the 4 R.E.M. cycles lasting approximately 15 minutes each, which is why your dreams may appear to jump around. Your brain has little to no activity during non-R.E.M. sleep, so as soon as you enter a new stage of R.E.M. sleep it&#39;s as if you never exited the last one, thus your remnant dream from the previous cycle appears to jump immediately into something totally unrelated: your new dream.

The point behind all of this is that your brain has the power to perceive time differently depending on the circumstances. When you&#39;re having fun, an hour seems to last for only a minute, but when you&#39;re working or waiting to get out of school that last hour of the day seems to last forever. Time seems to fly by as you get older and your cinema-quality dreams are, in actuality, no longer than some YouTube videos. Now, here comes the twist, so pay attention.

When a living being dies, it&#39;s brain remains active for approximately 10 minutes after death. Similar to the living headless body of a chicken running around in circles in the fact that the limbs of the decapitated poultry are still receiving neurological messages from the brain, when you die your brain is still active, receiving and interpreting stimuli for approximately 10 minutes after your death (roughly how long it takes for your brain to entirely shut down from lack of blood flow).

Now, take into account the aforementioned theory of time distortion and the fact that your brain remains active for a short period of time after death. What if (bear with me here) when you die, your brain warps the perception of those final moments of activity. What if that those 10 minutes of neurological activity are perceived to be an entire lifetime, similar to dreaming. You may only have a &quot;second life&quot; for 10 real minutes, but it could be perceived to last years and years. You could be reincarnated in your own mind and live a fictitious &quot;second life&quot; after death.

I know it&#39;s out there, it took me by surprise when I first read it as well, but as crazy as it is it&#39;s damn interesting and you cannot deny that. :)</description>

In theory, you could have an infinite amount of “second lives” if your brain triggered the “second life” as a unique event, and would thus keep “living” in a million lifetimes. Now, i haven’t read this any where before, but it just occurred to me that this infinite amount of “second lives” could in fact be the scientific explanation for reincarnation. That our brain “lives” until we “learn our lesson” That we were supposed to in that life.</p>

You may only have a “second life” for 10 real minutes, but it could be perceived to last years and years. You could be reincarnated in your own mind and live a fictitious “second life” after death.<br>

<p>Smoking too much salvia divinorum will do this. In 5 minutes, you can live a whole other life.[/quote]This. I’ve had no reaction to it, but my friend said that he thought he was Super Mario for what felt like an hour or so.</p>
<p>The only thing that I wouldn’t believe, if it’s what anyone tries tying into this, is that you are a ghost for another lifetime-- on earth for that 10 minutes… Because in that time, you’d be able to find yourself and time would, logically, not be in order. Your brain would shut down in 10 minutes, yet you have still have a lifetime to watch? To make it physically possible, everything would have to be moving in slow motion; so slow that it would see as if everything was frozen.</p>

              <p>Time is just a value like mass or distance. In our universe time is kept relatively constant, but can be affected by things like speed and gravity. However, like every other value in our environment it can mean anything to us so the rate in change in time we perceive can be changed whenever our brain wants to. That’s why time goes faster when you’re having fun, and all that dreaming stuff you mentioned.</p>
<p>I’ll try to explain my views on the life and death part a bit later, I find it really hard to get my thoughts into words that wont make me look like a dipshit.</p>

<p>For me, if i’m flying a airplane in a dream, I just go numb, I can’t feel anything, or know what the feeling of flying a airplane is like, because my mind (I guess?) doesn’t know what to fill that spot in with.</p>
