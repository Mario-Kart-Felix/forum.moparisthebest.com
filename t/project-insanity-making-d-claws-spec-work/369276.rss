    <title>[Project Insanity] making d claws spec work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-making-d-claws-spec-work/369276</link>
    <description>iv got it all in the claws are in the game with the spec bar on i think i have the right code to make them work but they dont like i click spec and and it doesnt hit the NPC it just turns spec off and hits it  and is there a spot in PI that you need to make it so it hits players also cuz thats how it is in delta you need a code in NPC and on players. im not sure if its the right code or even if i put them in the right spot i put the code in src/server/model/players/packets/clickingbuttons

the code is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;case 14484:
setAnimation(6000);
dclaws = 3;
checkclaws();
specialAmount -= 50;
lastSpecial = System.currentTimeMillis();
actionInterval = getbattleTimer();
lastAction = System.currentTimeMillis();
specOn = false;
usingSpecial = true;
break;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

              <p>There might be a bug, i know that will work, but not to weild it and just have spec there.</p>
<p>weild like a weapon with a special already, then use spec but donâ€™t attack anything, then weild the claws.</p>
