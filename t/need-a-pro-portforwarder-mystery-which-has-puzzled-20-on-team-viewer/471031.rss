    <title>Need A Pro Portforward&#39;er :) Mystery which has Puzzled 20+ On Team Viewer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-pro-portforwarder-mystery-which-has-puzzled-20-on-team-viewer/471031</link>
    <description>Too be honest, I have been trying to portforward for years. In the past I have have been through every kind of port forwarding help guide out there that took me all the way through setting up a static ip to learning about stealth ports. I am running Widows 7, I have S&amp;T internet which I contacted to see if they block any ports by default (which they dont) and I have a linksys e2500 router. I bought this router simply because linksys routers are common. I thought I would find numberous help topics on it. Which I did but none that helped me. I have added exceptions into my windows built in firewall, I have no other Internet Security other than AVG which I disabled completely while testing. If any Pro portforward&#39;er would like to give a stab at fixing this mystery, feel free to team view with me. I have had 20+ people over the past 2 years try to team view only leaving them feeling like they know nothing ;) Would someone please put an end to this already haha. This wouldnt be spoon feeding since I have spent so much of my own time trying to figure it out. I had a minecraft server running once like last year but now I can&#39;t even figure out how to get that forwarded correctly anymore. 

Thanks</description>

              <p>Too be honest, I have been trying to portforward for years. In the past I have have been through every kind of port forwarding help guide out there that took me all the way through setting up a static ip to learning about stealth ports. I am running Widows 7, I have S&amp;T internet which I contacted to see if they block any ports by default (which they dont) and I have a linksys e2500 router. I bought this router simply because linksys routers are common. I thought I would find numberous help topics on it. Which I did but none that helped me. I have added exceptions into my windows built in firewall, I have no other Internet Security other than AVG which I disabled completely while testing. If any Pro portforward’er would like to give a stab at fixing this mystery, feel free to team view with me. I have had 20+ people over the past 2 years try to team view only leaving them feeling like they know nothing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Would someone please put an end to this already haha. This wouldnt be spoon feeding since I have spent so much of my own time trying to figure it out. I had a minecraft server running once like last year but now I can’t even figure out how to get that forwarded correctly anymore.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
