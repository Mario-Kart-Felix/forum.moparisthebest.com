        <p>Well in my opinion RuneScape started to get worse at the 481 revision, I think this is the Bounty Hunter update and maybe the new Summoning skill aswell, but i’m not sure, anyway when i play RuneScape now a days, it seems like it is a whole new game compared to the older versions.</p>

Only about a year ago they were around 150k. Now they’re 1.7m. Ridiculous imo.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I wouldn’t really call that inflation.<br>
Back when Jagex released the Gold D’hide treasure trails was a really good source of gold. Years later new easier ways have been added which has resulted in less people doing clues which means less on the market so the price will increase.[/quote]<br>
Yes but it isn’t just those that have gone up by a significant amount. Things such as the whip which stayed around the 1.6-2m mark for years has increased to around 3m.<br>
Money is so easy to come across on runescape now its lost its value compared to the old days. Maybe the economy isn’t inflated, but it certainly has changed a lot and majority of it isn’t in a good way.</p>

<p>They released bounty hunter and the trade limit soon after that, and bounty hunter had the same aspect as Pking just with a few tweaks.<br>
The update wasn’t just to get rid of gp sellers, it was to get rid of the mass of botters and to stop sweat shops using stolen credit cards to buy membership. Jagex was going to get into a lot of trouble if they didn’t prevent it somehow.</p>

<p>The prices are controlled by the players. Proof of this is merching clans, they buy items at the highest price so the price goes up and then they sell them before they crash again.<br>
Hidden staff? Jagex moderators do have other accounts that they use for their own leisure. Many Jmods have said that they still play runescape on other accounts.<br>
Of course anyone could make the same amount of money, but obviously if you have a higher level in a certain skill than somebody else the chances are you can make more money than them.</p>

        <p>I found I could talk with alot more people in a better community back then then I can now. Obviously YOU didn’t play then. I saw this game change alot. I had been nearly scammed countless times, scammed even a few. Back to my point though, maybe it was just where I was, I found I could talk to alot more people then I could now. Like in 05 I did alot of mining, and I have some good memories of working my way up to the mining guild, fighting with everyone over those few coal ores under Falador.</p>
<p>See, by late 06 JaGeX realized that botting, scamming, real world stuff ect. was getting out of hand. First, it began with that place in Barb village with those retarded boots and new emotes. Also the safety books and the random event dude that would beat the shit out of you if you didn’t take his book. Remember before they actually set the trade limit, the question marks where added. This revolutionized noobs and brought scamming down, but it didn’t stop real world trading. So they took out the wildy, duel arena, added a Grand Exchange, which is pretty much economy control central. The GE wouldn’t be possible without controlled prices.</p>
<p>Even if there was more macroers, most of them would be found cutting trees, picking flax, or other simple quick tasks that required a basic read on a color type.</p>
<p>And Ok, maybe I don’t have proof of 500k, but alot did quit. That was alot of peoples prime source of income.<br>
Even so, why should I have to wait for a fucking circle to fill up and end up getting 1/5th of their stuff vs the full loot. Maybe they just need to increase there watch on trading stuff, and if a pattern is seen in any form of mass amount of traded money to someone in a single day, or the same kill on a person very consecutively, they could just loose the right. There staff is only about 100, maybe they need to increase player mods.</p>

<p>Jagex is trying to increase their player mods.</p>
<p>At the subject of trade, I think they have a fair method now of quest points and how long you’ve been friends with someone to increase trade.<br>
If you have 150 quest points and friends for 2 months you can trade 150k.<br>
I think it’s fair.</p>

        <p>[quote=“the elve age, post:5, topic:336098”]Because, your most likely a player of 2008-to now (don’t lie).</p>
<p>If you played from 2003-2007, you would understand why.</p>
<p>Runescape’s concept of their game is completely different then it once was, and even Zezima said Runescape is way to easy to train and earn money, the concept of the game has change drastically.</p>
<p>Why do we play private servers? To have a customized version of Runescape and play with players who miss the old Runescape (sadly there aren’t many players who played old Runescape, 89% of them are liars, and say they did)[/quote]</p>

        <p>I played runescape in 2003 - 2005 then quit. then came back in 2006-07… then quit in 08…</p>
<p>The only reason i would go back and play runescape would be if they added these:</p>
<p>Wilderness back to olden days.<br>
No Trade limits.<br>
Everything back to it was in 2003. It was better in 2003 then it was ever…</p>

        <p>some of us don’t play rsps instead we create games and use runescape’s client as our base. As you may know most servers are custom built around the client. So if we wanted to we could make a game and no one would ever know it had the runescape base.</p>
