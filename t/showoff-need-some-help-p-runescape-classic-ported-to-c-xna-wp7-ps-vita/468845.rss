    <description>Hey guys!

I wanted to wait until this was all completed before I showed you guys this.
However... Ive ran into a bit of a problem now in the final stages and been working on it the past few days to solve it. Now I can&#39;t be arsed anymore. I might need some help here :)

Before we get there, proof of concept. I have uploaded a video on youtube. ( Only displaying the PC Version of the C#/XNA port right now )

[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9mtT1uFiSs[/youtube]

Im aiming for this to run on PC, xbox360, Windows Phone 7 ( Will probably work a lot better on WP8 but i havnt started developing for it yet ) and Playstation Vita.

All source codes will be released upon completion. That means the Source code for the PC version, WP7 (+Maybe WP8), Playstation Vita, *xbox360

*xbox360 = i havnt started on this port yet, so can&#39;t say for sure when it will be done.



[b]The problem[/b]
As seen in the video, certain areas / or sections. Seem to get stacked roofs and for what I know; which isnt that much tbh. Even though I&#39;ve spent like 2 weeks porting this beast.

My thoughts:
1. the tiles are being loaded incorrectly???     - ive checked this one lots of times already and they seem to load perfectly fine.
2. faulty camera?                                      - when adding a model/the roofs. Doesnt seem to add more than necessary ( i could be wrong, not checked properly. )
3. enginehandle incorrectly rendering the objects?? - heck, ive become so blind of all the coding my head is all smooshy and I cant even remember if this roof bug have been in here from early stages or if it came in later on... What im saying is that I cant think back of things ive done before that could have caused this.


hehe.. Sorry if this is very confusing, I seriously didnt know how to put this up :D
And I totally understand if noone has been through this problem before or similar bug as this related to porting it over to c# ( 99.99% sure its that ) otherwise its something that I have caused or missed to think about when porting it over.


If anyone have any ideas, suggestions, thoughts, anything you got in mind. let me know! :D
But until then! Cheerios and take care!

** Everything is based on MoparScape Classic **

[b]EDIT:[/b]
Aww. I noticed it now.. peterbjornx here on the forums already beat me to it a year ago. (Though, *you* / he ported the #317 RS2 client)
But same thing here, because of the software rendering both clients have in common the gameplay is extremely laggy* slow on any devices.

This I had hopes for solving a bit further on during the development by learning more about how the client is rendering its graphical content. And in my case put the whole rendering on the GPU instead of the CPU.</description>

              <p>It looks like you’re reading the data correctly, i think the underlying problem might be with using the data. If you don’t mind could you PM me the ‘EngineHandle’ class? I would love to see how you have ported it, nonetheless help out.</p>

              <p>[quote=“imthenull, post:2, topic:468845”]Nice work, we’ve never seen anything like this before besides Zilent’s C++ client, but that’s a different story. I would probably check to see when rendering the roofs if it is iterating through the sectors correctly. maybe you are not even iterating through them when rendering the roofs? You should be loading the 3 levels (each a different sector) into memory, and the camera shall iterate through them to render. That’s my conclusion after watching your video.</p>
<p>Edit: are you using RSCD cache? or the original rsc cache for your landscape?[/quote]</p>
<p>thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>I’m using the original rsc cache for the landscape.<br>
I basically ported over the code for MoparScape to get this to work. Which means, java to c#</p>
<p>byte =&gt; sbyte, all data reading, etc. also made by converting the bytes read into sbytes (signed bytes. -128? to +128) c#‘s orginal byte’ is 0-256.<br>
That means at some point i could have missed one or two values that were supposed to be a negative value to become a positive value and then resulting in rendering it in a wrong way.</p>
<p>But again, as I said in the first post. I’ve gotten pretty code-blind and can’t see what faults i’ve made at this point.<br>
If anyone is profecient in c# and java (enough) that would love to help out then i’d be super happy to share the code i’ve got right now. =) Until then i’ll try to figuere it out myself… Which is not completely easy.</p>
<p>All I want to see in the end is this game running on more devices than just the ordinary PC <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
