    <description>Hey guys,  I thought some of you might be interested in this idea.  Basically what you can do is create a script to run over night and make you money.  Since I&#39;m not allowed to tell you the site you can email me at - to find out more (make title be &quot;Money&quot;).  

How you make the money- you sign up through this certain site which allows you to make money every time you search through the site.  (Currently I&#39;m using a free tool called autohotkey to do the clicking and searching for me but I know there are better programs out there)  

You make about 5 cents a search (they are able to pay you this because they get paid like 10 cents for every search you do).  They do have detection software so you would need to be able to create a script to search maybe once every 10 or so mins and problably wouldn&#39;t want to do more then 60 searches a day.  I tested it out and 21 of my searches were only removed from searching within a short period of time.  

This company is through England and pays you in £.  £1=$2 US currency.  They pay through paypal and you have to have a £20 min to do so.   

If you have anymore questions just post it here or email me!</description>
