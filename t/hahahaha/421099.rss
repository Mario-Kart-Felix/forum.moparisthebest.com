              <p>My point of view is that the ToS are designed to prevent people from “damaging” the gaming experience. If people violate the ToS, they are damaging the gaming experience for other players, and ruining the integrity of Jagex’s product. I think this is the only angle they can come from. More importantly, though, they would be able to show that some players, regardless of being banned from breaking the ToS, continue to consciously violate their terms and continue to ruin Jagex’s product.</p>
<p>But even saying “ruin Jagex’s product” is a stretch, like Greeny said. They would need very good lawyers to prove this point. They have no angle where they can correlate ToS violators and loss of profits, unless they somehow consider all the extra bot task forces to be a “loss of profits.” I don’t know.</p>
<p>I don’t think suing players is going anywhere, other than being a good scare tactic to impress upon the RuneScape community. I mean this is surely terrible for business in the short-term, so it’s definitely an extreme for them to take right now. “Have you ever played RuneScape?” “What? No. I hear the company that makes it sues their players, haha.” etc</p>

<p>Terms and conditions are just that, terms and conditions. Jagex’s T&amp;C are not the law, breaking their T&amp;C is not breaking the law. They can get you for trying to cause them monetary loss or whatever it is their suing for now, although it all seems sort of silly, trying to sue players…</p>
