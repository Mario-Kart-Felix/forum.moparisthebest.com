    <title>[recruiting] [developer] PI 317 06 remake</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/recruiting-developer-pi-317-06-remake/534191</link>
    <description>Hi guys, first of all I know there are already a lot of remakes out there trying to get up and going, but I&#39;m quite dedicated to try and make mine one of the best.

I started this server a a bit week ago, with one of my friends I met on another remake server.
He has alright coding skills but is still learning to use pi and a lot of things, but we have spent  time fixing things, to the best of our ability while we have been running. 

My background is more in other private servers, I&#39;ve used a lot of php applications before, ran WoW private servers, and been admins on them which none have succeeded to any point, due to the small amount of players that change on those type of servers, but from what I&#39;ve seen it&#39;s quite different with rsps and what I&#39;ve experience the last week with having this server online, people get attracted quite fast, and try to help. But there are still those few that are the &quot;I&#39;m l33t coder &amp; I&#39;m 15 group&quot; that I&#39;ve seen try push their way into a server, by acting superior, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m after.

I&#39;m looking for a content developer for my server remake of runescape 2006, someone with knowledge in client and or server would be great, I&#39;m really looking for 1-2 people that could join us and help out would be greatly appreciated.

We are currently running from a PI base, which was a released source I can&#39;t quite remember the name but I can find it if you wish to inquire about the server and joining.

I currently have all ready: 
1 year website vps
Domain
Game server VPS ( CentOS6) 

The website is all setup and also forum, and we have had people playing around on the server, with my previous experience with websites and running things, and my other developers experience I think anyone with a good attitude and faith in making something good is what we are looking for. 

Just shoot me a PM if you would like to inquire,

Thanks for your time reading this thread,
Aoro
