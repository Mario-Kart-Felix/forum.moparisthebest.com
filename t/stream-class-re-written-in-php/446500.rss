    <title>Stream class re-written in PHP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stream-class-re-written-in-php/446500</link>
    <description>Me and a buddy are making an RSPS that runs completely in PHP on a webserver, so I converted the Stream class first. All of the methods work except for read/writeLong because PHP doesn&#39;t support 64bit integers and it&#39;s overflowing. Here is a copy of the class if anyone needs it, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been looking all over for it! 

The goal for this work is to eventually run a RSPS from a free webhost :3 

Copy of the Stream.php
[url=http://pastebin.com/B318TVXd][PHP] JaGEx Stream Class - Rewritten in PHP - Pastebin.com[/url] 

Here&#39;s an example of how you would use it for bytes:
[code]
$stream = new Stream();
$i = 255;
$stream-&gt;writeByte($i);
$stream-&gt;setCurrentOffset(0);
echo $stream-&gt;readUnsignedByte();
[/code]

              <p>Well I’m not actually sure how it would actually work. It’s a little late, but I was assuming I could store the current state of the server in the database, (Online players, positions, etc) then pick one of the connected clients at random to initiate the updating. It would definitely be complicated.</p>
<p>EDIT: Cron jobs would allow a central server to run</p>

No, it should only apply to the client performing the action, unless it’s a large database query.<br>
Fast connection is not a problem for paid hosts.</p>

Bad wording. I meant to say PHP didn’t have asynchronous capability. Was hoping you would pick up on it.<br>
I never implied they were slow, just that they can appear slow.<br>
Even then, running it on a shared host is not realistic, as they limit resources, and a lot will just ban you for it.</p>
