    <title>GemMiner (android game) Save Editor!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gemminer-android-game-save-editor/394792</link>
    <description>Well, Currently I am in the process of making a game save editor for one of my favorite Android OS games, &#39;Gem Miner: Dig Deeper&#39;. Currently, this is what it can read:

Output in CMD:
[code]
ID of game: 1
Difficulty: 0
Grid Types: [[I@186db54
Cash: 218
Collection Count: 0
Axe Power: 1
Drill Power: 0
Free Space: 10
[/code]

After I fully get the reading working, I will need to work on re-saving, as the editing ability is the easiest part. If anybody would like to give it a shot, here is the source (I converted the classes.dex into a jar, and then from there, the wonders of JAD).
Download:
http://up.ht/kbeM4R

Before you ask, yes, since you (and I) are using his code (imports mainly, as to load the game, they are needed) you are violating copyright laws. I just figured this would be a neat task for the community to try and do. Such an easy task for me (only started this like 4 minutes ago), and I want to see if anybody else wants to give it a shot. I will be willing to try out game-save edits from people, but please, do not mess with the map, don&#39;t need anything corrupted on me.

EDIT: Alright, I have successfully written a save editor in about 5 minutes or less total time lmfao. Only hard part was deciding what methods are needed, and what to take out/re-write because of JAD. If anybody would like a screenshot, I can get one.

Here is a download for myn: (only adds 999k and saves, but it does not load all of the data atm, the backpack size goes back to small, but easily re-upgraded from new cash)

<p>And have you seen how large and extensive the android api is… You have a learn a lot about the concepts of creating an android app, plus all the classes used to implement it. Yes, you’ll know the syntax of the language, but many trivial tasks are done differently using the api such as opening a file.</p>

<p>i also played with motorola xoom, the both the plain one and the one with nvidia; the one with nvidia did awesome(overall the xoom tablet was awesome) on the 3d tests for quad but my crap intercept did better on the 2d test. one thing i didnt understand is why the database reads and write took a bit for both the nexus s and xoom, when my crap phone passes those tests in a couple seconds(much quicker than both the other devices).</p>
<p>im thinking about looking into android app development, and possible modding. i found app inventor its a pretty neat little app, has some work to do but its still beta. its not for serious development but its fun to mess with, and its quite interesting, with it using the open-block library.</p>

<p>cool. i want a galaxy phone. im debating between epic 4g and nexus s, both the same price with 2 year contract(, but i have seen the epic for $100 less). i tried the nexus today, thats one nice phone the only thing it lacks is a sd card slot, but i dont think u really need one if it comes with 16 gb, i mean i havent even used the the 8 gig card i have.[/quote]<br>
I would personally go with one that has an SD card slot. Mainly because I like to ‘play’ with my phones (install custom ROM) and clockworkmod recovery works alot better if you have an SD lol. That’s just me, but between the Epic and the Nexux-S, the Epic looks like the exact same phone when closed (imo), so if it has an SD card slot, and has a keyboard, I would much rather the Epic lol.</p>
