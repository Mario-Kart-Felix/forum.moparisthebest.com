    <title>Some 525 deob questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-525-deob-questions/367892</link>
    <description>i would like to know some of thse answers, because they are simple and it would make things easier for me.
1. How to change NPC hp
2. How to change/delete/add npcs into the server (like delta autospawn.cfg)
3. Change item prices in stores
4. How to change item stats
5. add objects
6. add coordinates to portals
7. were are commands located
8. Change were magic teleports take you too (e.g varrock teleport on the spellbook), and to require them no runes to use
i found out other things myself like changing login messages, timed messages,interface messages,npc messages,shop stocks etc.
But i cant seem to find these ones out.. could someone point me to them?
