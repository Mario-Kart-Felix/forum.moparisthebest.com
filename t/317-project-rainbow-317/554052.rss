About Project Rainbow:
Project Rainbow is a 317 RSPS that has been around since early 2011.
Some of our modellers have made loads of custom items so now we have over 400+ Custom items for you to enjoy!
Current Owner Jack(Jek) has been applying updates for many months with help from Telenim and Whac so that we can give the players the best experience of an RSPS we can.

----------------------------------------------------------------
New Updates:
[spoiler]
Here is some of the newest updates that we have currently released!
----------------------------------------------------------------
On the 27th of November 2 new zones have been added into Project Rainbow.

-Rainbowian Zone x3:
In PR we have a &quot;Rainbow&quot; themed zone that contains several Npcs that drop good items. After a few months of the Rainbowian x2 Zone being out, we have decided to add a brand new zone with more Npcs. The zone does cost a lot of money with in-game points and money but is really worth the grind! 
If you enjoy working hard to gain access to a zone, you will enjoy this! 

-Luigis&#39; Lair
The zone contains Luigis, yes! Luigis!
We like to ask members of the community what items and Npcs they would like to see that this is what they have chosen. We added a nice drop table of items you can obtain from it with also a small price to pay for the zone.
[/spoiler]

Dive into the small/medium/high player community, it’s had during a few years there is no other community like this. There’s trolls, caring people, mature people you’ll find every kind of person at this servers community.<br>
Many of the players who started years ago like me, find ourself having a hard time to ‘quit’ PR it has something special that keeps you coming back.</p>
<p>Join the server and maybe you’ll feel the PR vibe.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

I’m not trying to trash your thread but. why are you using a czar server? the interface that comes up looks like one from an old figment scape server. the island reminds me of the old server  rune isle even the spawn is the same as well as the old new player has joined login.<br>

Project Rainbow’s been around since 2010. It’s a Delta server. The interface that comes up, I can almost guarantee, is a normal interface found in 317 servers that has custom text and stuff. The newbie spawn area, I’ll admit, isn’t that great, and maybe it should be removed altogether.</p>

<p>How I imagine Lumbridge looks</p>

</aside>
<p>Lumbridge isn’t really a part of the server, there’s a home place though.<br>
The only thing you could find rainbow wise, will be certain items which have multiple colours or change colours.</p>

<p>About Project Rainbow:<br>
Project Rainbow is a 317 RSPS that has been around since early 2011.<br>
Some of our modellers have made loads of custom items so now we have over 400+ Custom items for you to enjoy!<br>
Current Owner Jack(Jek) has been applying updates for many months with help from Telenim and Whac so that we can give the players the best experience of an RSPS we can.</p>
<hr>
<h2>New Updates:<br>
[spoiler]<br>
Here is some of the newest updates that we have currently released!</h2>
<p>On the 27th of November 2 new zones have been added into Project Rainbow.</p>
<p>-Rainbowian Zone x3:<br>
In PR we have a “Rainbow” themed zone that contains several Npcs that drop good items. After a few months of the Rainbowian x2 Zone being out, we have decided to add a brand new zone with more Npcs. The zone does cost a lot of money with in-game points and money but is really worth the grind!<br>
If you enjoy working hard to gain access to a zone, you will enjoy this!</p>
<p>-Luigis’ Lair<br>
The zone contains Luigis, yes! Luigis!<br>
We like to ask members of the community what items and Npcs they would like to see that this is what they have chosen. We added a nice drop table of items you can obtain from it with also a small price to pay for the zone.<br>
