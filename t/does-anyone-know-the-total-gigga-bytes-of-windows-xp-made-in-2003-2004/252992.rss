    <description>Mod please move to the appropriate section if this is in the wrong section.

Well, i&#39;m not sure if this guy has been ripping off my family for repairing my computer. Idk how to check for the software but i know 74.5GB is rip off somehow. If anyone can tell me what the max GB of a windows xp computer made during 2003-2004 please post! I really need this info to be sure he not ripping us off.

And before this guy came we had another computer repairing named Mike who upgraded my computer to vista (first ever version that had no side bar, but vista buttons and stuff), and we payed way less then what we pay for now.

[b]PS[/b]: If your not understanding this, then post so I can try and explain it better.</description>

<p>You are asking if a 74.5gigabyte hard drive is small for one made in 2003-2004, the answer is no really. You can store quite a bit with that. Most computers these days come with 320gb hard drives.</p>
<p>If you manage to fill all of the 74.5gb up with shit then i’d be surprised.</p>
<p>And there isn’t really a max GB hard drive for a computer…</p>
