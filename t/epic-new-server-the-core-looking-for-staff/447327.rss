    <title>EPIC NEW SERVER The Core Looking for Staff</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/epic-new-server-the-core-looking-for-staff/447327</link>
    <description>Welcome to The Core. We have mature Staff members that are all around the world so you will always get help when you need it. All staff members are experienced in the way of running a server from a technical way as well as in-game help. As of right now, the server is very new and is looking for active players to roam/dominate the minecraft world. This server is completely free to play on but there are benefits to donating such as /jumpto, /tp, /tphere, etc. 

Plugins Include: 
1) GroupManager 

2) WorldEdit (used by admins) 

3) Permissions (help organizes the server) 

4) logblock (anti-griefing measures) 

5) Multiverse (Multiple worlds support!) 

6) NoCheat (keep toughs pesky modders in their place!) 

7) LWC (Now you don&#39;t have to worry about people stealing stuff from you) 

8) Essentials (include many commands such as /afk, /me, /ping, /msg, etc) 

9)EssentialsSpawn (include commands such as /spawn, /home, /home set, etc) 

10) EssentialsChat (Helps manage chat) 

11)Iconomy(Added money into the game 

12) Chestshop (A perfect addition to Iconomy, allows you to sell items even when your not on!) 

13) [size=18pt]Towny (epic plugin that let&#39;s you make a city and protect it from anyone person that you don&#39;t want)[/size]

Feel free to leave a Suggestion to the server in the replies.
[size=12pt]Want to see some picture?  Go to the our website (we are changing websites as we speak:) http://thecoremcserver.webs.com/server-pictures[/size]
