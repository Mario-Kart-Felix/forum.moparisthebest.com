    <description>I&#39;m having problems with java. I can&#39;t use anything that has to do with java. For example runescape doesn&#39;t work. And the moparscape downloadable client just immediately closes when I open it. I have tried to completely re-download it, but it still doesn&#39;t work. Does anybody maybe know why?</description>
