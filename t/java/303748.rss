    <description>hello everyone, i need help with a few 508+ sources of mine. First what java do i need? I have jdk 6.0_16 and it compiles 317&#39;s for me, but when i try compiling 508+ sources or clients, it says &quot;You need to have Java files for this compiler to compile. Press any key to continue.&quot; And i also have regular java for like running runescape and stuff. So if any knows a link or the name of it please reply! Thanks.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 22, 2009, 02:40:21 pm[/size][hr]and can somebody give me the stuff i need to put in the compilers? like the code to make it run? Thanks.</description>
