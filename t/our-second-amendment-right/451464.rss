<p>I think we have to consider exactly why guns were used back then honestly. They were used not  only for protection purposes ( random bears walking into your house and stuff ) , but also for hunting down food for your family to eat.</p>

<p>on the other hand the second amendment can be read that the right of a well regulated militia (which the militia is required for a free state), the people of whom shall not be refused the right to bear arms</p>
<p>it’s worth noting that the second amendment says nothing about the right to bear arms for protection for family or homes, it’s the supreme court who says that</p>
<p>and on a third hand (radioactive waste, don’t ask) the second amendment says nothing about keeping nuclear arms either, can I get one fatman please?</p>

Sometimes it can be a horrible thing though…  It could even push some of them to kill others with the guns that they were trained to handle.  Think about it.  If you give people the power to kill another human being and many more and they snap, then all hell breaks loose.  Even little things can snap inside the army veterans that cause them to go on a rampage.</p>

              <p>Using the most repetitive statement about gun control: Guns don’t kill people. People kill people.</p>
<p>Violence via guns is unstoppable. No matter what screenings or regulations are put into place, people will still be able to find ways around. Hell, I’m selling one of my old kayaks and I was offered a glock as a trade for it.</p>
<p>Rather than fund gun regulation, what needs to be done is fund more into finding out more about people with potential psychological problems who may present problems(example: James Holmes sent one of his counselors)-Now I’m not promoting the government go 1984 but allow some interaction to prevent these types of things from happening.</p>
<p>I’ll leave the rest to MITB.</p>

<p>The two purposes I support gun usages is revolution and to fight of occupiers (Real one, not the liberal 99% movement). So I give no support to handguns. As I do not support public use, by making all weapons illegal to carry in public, you can stop people for just bearing arms in public places. (Sorry for that terrible grammar, I’m somewhat tired)</p>
