    <title>Shops Screwed up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shops-screwed-up/226113</link>
    <description>Okay I&#39;m using Allstar scape source and I tried to add more items to a food shop and when I compiled and ran it i had no errors at all. But when i tried to trade with him it lagged me out.   So I deleted the changes I made and it was still screwed up.  Wtf??!!?!?!?!  P.s. - The shop I edited was an already existing shop.</description>
