    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/right-click-menu/550951</link>
    <description>Does anybody have a clue on how to add a staff members crown to the right click menu? E.g when you right click a staff member in-game, they will have a crown next to their name...Literally i&#39;ve tried to many different things, but nothing is working out... 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance.</description>

              <p>I figured out how to do it the other day. <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,668337.msg4480071.html#msg4480071" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">see here</a>.</p>
<p>I had to find the code that draws the text and change it from a RSFont to a TextDrawingArea. It may be different for you, depending on your client.<br>
Note: This is also in my client: <a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/snippets/236030-new-text-engine-like-459-a.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/snippets/236030-new-text-engine-like-459-a.html</a></p>

              <p>Welliton, I’m sure that this is supposed to be handled client side.</p>
<p>The code i’ve tried to use is this</p>
<p><code>s = modIcons[2]+"@or2@" + getRank(player.skill) + "@whi@ " + player.name //CLIQUE DROITE
					+ combatDiffColor(myPlayer.combatLevel, player.combatLevel)
					+ " (level-" + player.combatLevel + ")";</code></p>
<p>No errors or anything, but this is the result <img src="http://i.imgur.com/GQKtAF5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I have tried <span class="mention">@cr2</span>@ but that didn’t do anything (as i expected), do you have any idea how to move forward from here?</p>

              <p>I would think this is both server/client sided. You would first need to have the crown sprites in your cache, and from there you should look to see if you have something along the lines of “<a class="mention" href="/u/cr1">@cr1</a>@” which represents the staff crowns (in this case, the moderator crown).</p>
<p>Then check your client class in your server and find something like: <code>outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);</code><br>
(Depends on your base)</p>
<p>This is where your options such as, “attack” , “follow” etc should be kept. Add an if statement for the playerRights which looks something like the one below, and slot in <a class="mention" href="/u/cr1">@cr1</a>@:<br>
<code>if (playerRights == 1)
			{
				outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
				outStream.writeByteC(2);		
				outStream.writeByteA(0);		
				outStream.writeString("@cr1@@whi@follow");
				outStream.endFrameVarSize();
			}</code></p>
<p>I made this up from the spot, I work with allstar, Delta &amp; Czar but i’ve never used PI so you may have to change accordingly.</p>
