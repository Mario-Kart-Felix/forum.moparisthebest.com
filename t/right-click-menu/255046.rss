    <title>Right-click menu</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/right-click-menu/255046</link>
    <description>When you right click on people in my server its odd because for the admins it says Attack, walk here, ban, Trade with, and kick. But it doesnt do anything. i was hoping that someone could tell me how i can make it so the menu is like this: attack, walk here, follow, trade with, and kick.
But i want the kick to actually work!

please someone help me :O

Thanks -  Maxim</description>
