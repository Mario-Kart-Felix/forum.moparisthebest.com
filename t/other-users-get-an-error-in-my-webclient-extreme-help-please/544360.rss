    <title>Other users get an Error in my Webclient [EXTREME HELP] please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/other-users-get-an-error-in-my-webclient-extreme-help-please/544360</link>
    <description>NOTE: I&#39;m Verisimilitude from r-s and Paramore from runelous. I honestly need help with this. I followed a bunch of tuts and videos for the past 7 hours as of now and no luck.
Been having them do this for too long, and it&#39;s painful seeing them have to use up some of their time because I couldn&#39;t find myself a useful tut that has my desire needs.

[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] I deleted all the [COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;].java[/COLOR] &amp; [COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;].bat[/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] Made sure my signlink is finding the cache in the located folder.
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] Created the Webclient from [COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]JarMaker[/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] Signed the Webclient
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] I open the Webclient and works perfectly with the no-ip
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] I put the Webclient to the [COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]Dropbox[/COLOR] for my cousins and brother to test out if it&#39;ll work for them.
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] They open it 
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] If I don&#39;t sign the Webclient it just says [COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]Unable to load/download &quot;server&quot; cache[/COLOR]
[COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]-[/COLOR] But if I jar sign the Webclient, it then says [COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]connecting to file server[/COLOR] 3 seconds later... [COLOR=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;]Unable to load/download &quot;server&quot; cache[/COLOR]

Is there something i&#39;m suppose to do with the cache within the Client folder becoming a Webclient? Or it&#39;s simply I&#39;m missing something?

For some tuts, when I sign it I get this picture under me. Otherwise others is just the certificate.txt/certificate.exe
