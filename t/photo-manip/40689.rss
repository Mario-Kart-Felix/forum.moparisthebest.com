    <description>I havent been here in a while.  my internet was down for two weeks while I was waiting for verizons fiberoptics, so all I had were some stocks to mess around with.  I just did a bunch of filters and photo filters etc.  I also had to remove some backround stuff that was annoying in the first one.
