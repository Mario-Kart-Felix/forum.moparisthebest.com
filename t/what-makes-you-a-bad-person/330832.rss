    <title>What makes you a bad person?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-makes-you-a-bad-person/330832</link>
    <description>Not all bad people are in jail, and not all people in jail are bad. So, what defines a bad person? Of course we have the degree of murder for the sake of killing someone, but where do you draw the line of good and bad?

There are a number of individuals that believe marijuana and other drugs render you in the category of negative individuals, but what if it were for the sake of experimentation? You only live one life, what&#39;s wrong with trying as much as you possibly can within the small time span we&#39;re given?

There are others that believe steeling opens the door to greed and deficient morals. But what if it were to continue your family&#39;s health? What about the whole man, the family and the bread story? If one were to steel bread in order to save his or her family, is it still considered bad?

There are a number of construed reasons for pending someone to a &quot;bad&quot; list, but among what judgment is someone aloud to pass this test? What do you feel defines a bad person?

<p>No, you’d write it, name it the bible, then people would be like, “Oh, heres a bible, I’ll buy it because I am interested in the content within.” Then they’d read it and say, “Hey, whats this? No bible, you ridda wrong book, gai.”</p>
<p>Name it something else, like The Bible 2.</p>

<p>Really all that would need to happen for that is a couple followers to start, then it would grow. Dont hate me, but im gonna use Charles Manson for an example. He got into many peoples heads because of stuff he said to them.</p>
<p>NOTE THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE, but i do know this is the method he used, not 100%, but a close to one he used in the 70’s because of all the drugs around.</p>
<p>Girl - runs around frantic she just got kicked out of her house<br>
Charles - Stops her and says “Really? Those damn people just don’t like you do they? Come hang out with me and the others who were treated the same way”<br>
Girl - Because she is lost and confused, she follows him in hopes of help.</p>
<p>Its just catching people at the right moment in time that influences them the most. Sure, today, we have the brains to go to one of our friend’s house and see if we can stay there for a short while, until we can make it on our own. Some do get easily influenced by others when they are lost/confused.</p>
<p>I know i could have used allot better of an example, but it was the only thing i could think of.</p>
