    <title>JAVA IS MY BITCH COME BACK :( (doooooooont leave meee)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-is-my-bitch-come-back-doooooooont-leave-meee/168884</link>
    <description>Rofl, aight uhm Java the void you helped me add works and everything but theres just a few tweaks needed.
The initial idea was just to randomize spawn points when someone first logs in to the server.. What the void is doing is once you log out for a period of time, then once you log back in you are teled from your current position back to the graveyard, i.e. my randomize spawning area

Anyway you could help me make it so it doesn&#39;t actually TELEPORT them but rather just have them spawn there?</description>
