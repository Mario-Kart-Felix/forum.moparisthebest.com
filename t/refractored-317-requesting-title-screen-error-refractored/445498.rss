    <title>[Refractored] (317) Requesting Title Screen - Error [Refractored]</title>

    <description>Hello MoparScape,

I&#39;m having trouble getting my client to finish starting up. It&#39;s getting caught relatively early in its startingUp() method, at the point where it tries to load the title screen.

[code=java]titleStreamLoader = streamLoaderForName(1, &quot;title screen&quot;, &quot;title&quot;, expectedCRCs[1], 25);[/code]

Further investigating into the streamLoaderForName method, it proceeds to take some of the parameters to another method:

[code=java]DataInputStream datainputstream = openJagGrabInputStream(s1 + j);[/code]

Which would be the following, in my case:

[code=java]DataInputStream datainputstream = openJagGrabInputStream(title0);[/code]

I added some debugging System.out&#39;s to track exactly what this thing is doing, and it gets to this part:

[code=java]aSocket832 = openSocket(43594);[/code]

In the openSocket method, the return type is Socket, and this all the code within the openSocket() method:

[code=java]return new Socket(InetAddress.getByName(server), port);[/code]

The parameter &#39;server&#39; is set to a no-ip domain, and the port is the standard 43594. But it always gets hung up right at this point. At first, I thought it was an issue loading the background image itself (since I had cache problems before), but now I&#39;m thinking this has nothing to do with an image, and it&#39;s more of a networking related problem, which is definitely not one of my strong areas.

Can anyone give any ideas as to what may be the problem, and how to solve it? One of my ideas is that I shouldn&#39;t use the no-ip domain as the server, but I&#39;m not sure.

Thanks,

Skyro. :)</description>
