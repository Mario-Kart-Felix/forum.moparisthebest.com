    <title>How to limit files in client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-limit-files-in-client/413551</link>
    <description>I downloaded the server &amp; client which was called Corruption X which is 562 I think.

However I am trying to set all up then send the client to friends but I can&#39;t help but think there are too many files compared to what it normally is when you download someone else&#39;s client. How do I make the client just run for everyone else which has all IP and port connection info ready.

Also; where do I change the IP &amp; port info in the client to connect? I can connect atm because it&#39;s 127.0.0.1 but my friend can&#39;t.

Thank you in advance :)</description>

<p>The 562 client has 455 class files (not including the external libs), totaling about 900KB. Which is honestly not very much. The thing that increases the size most frequently is people packaging the client jar with the cache (which can easily reach large sizes, due to all the shit people put in it).</p>
<p>Also, to have your friends connect, they need to put in your No-IP address. 127.0.0.1 is the localhost address, so it tries to connect to a server running on their computer, when in fact there isn’t one.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>I have seen on Deathly Souls server that it only has a few files in their client yet it’s over 500, it takes a good while to download the client and this may put off other potential players.</p>

              <p>thats because its over 500. they have alot of files. to change the ip, look in the Client’s GUI and search ‘server’ it should say ‘SERVER = 127.0.0.1’ change it to ur hosted ip.</p>
