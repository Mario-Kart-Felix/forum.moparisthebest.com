    <description>(First of all: I&#39;m talking very small. No dupes, spawns, or crashing. Or anything like that.)
Second: This is very simple, and I know that. So don&#39;t flame me for posting something that elite coders should know already.
(* = could be this, could be that. It depends.)


[b]Requirements: A client with drop-down menus, possibly the ability to convert small things.
Tested on: Fubergen 2.0, but it should work on any client with drop down menus.
Difficulty: 0/10
Classes modified: Bot.java*, client.java*, Gui.java*, EGUI.java* (Depends on your client.)
[/b]
OK, let&#39;s get started.

Open up the class with drop-down menus available in it, (For Fubergen 2.0 it&#39;s Bot.java, 4.0 it&#39;s Gui.java)
Now find where it lists the menus. (Should say stuff like &quot;File,&quot; &quot;Server,&quot; maybe &quot;Info&quot;)
Find the value of &quot;File.&quot; It&#39;s most likely 1. In the file, it should say something like:
[code]            JMenu jmenu = new JMenu(&quot;File&quot;);[/code]
or maybe it&#39;ll say,
[code]            JMenu jmenu1 = new JMenu(&quot;File&quot;);[/code]
If the first one, it&#39;s just default. If the second, the value is 1. You get it, right?
Now in the client, open the menu up.
Find one of the options there, for me - the main option was &quot;Quit.&quot;
So now search in the file for what you found. I searched for &quot;Quit&quot;
Aha! I found this:
[code]            String as[] = {
                &quot;Quit&quot;
            };[/code]
OK now, if you only have one option - I&#39;m going to shed some light onto you. To make more, you have to make &#39; &quot;Quit&quot; &#39; into, &#39; &quot;Quit&quot;, &quot;Option2&quot;, &quot;Option3&quot; &#39; Et Cetera.
So, we&#39;re going to make it simple: Allow us to noclip without typing ::noclip so we don&#39;t get banned, let us see the frames per second rate, and allow us to zoom out.
So let&#39;s make it...
[code]            String as[] = {
                &quot;Noclip&quot;, &quot;FPS&quot;, &quot;Zoom&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;Quit&quot;
            };[/code]
(You might not want the dash in there - it&#39;s set up in my client to replace the dash with a separator.)
Now search for what you searched for earlier, again. I searched for &quot;Quit&quot; once more. (By the way - if you haven&#39;t gotten it, it&#39;s ctrl + f)
Aha again!
I found this:
[code]            if(s.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Quit&quot;))
            {
                System.exit(-1);
            }[/code]
So now, let&#39;s add the codes for noclip, fps, and the zoom.
Add these right above that:
[code] if(s.equals(&quot;Noclip&quot;))
                        {
                            for(int k1 = 0; k1 &lt; 4; k1++)
                            {
                                for(int i2 = 1; i2 &lt; 103; i2++)
                                {
                                    for(int k2 = 1; k2 &lt; 103; k2++) 
                                        aClass11Array1230[k1].anIntArrayArray294[i2][k2] = 0;

                                }

                            }
			}
if(s.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;FPS&quot;))
            {
                aBoolean1156 = !aBoolean1156;
            }
if(s.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Zoom&quot;))
            {
                cameratoggle = !cameratoggle;
            }[/code]
Save &amp; Compile.
Now open up your client again, open the file menu - and there they are!
The three new &quot;cheating&quot; options that we added in. Now, this may not be the cheat client you want - but hey, you can Noclip into staff areas and things like that now, see if you&#39;re going to lag, and check if any administrators are watching you.
Enjoy!

Good job.<br>
[/quote]<br>
How is it a good job? He simply added a cheat button, and a client sided item change, does nothing good tbh, because server still reads it as something else. Better options are like, a object and npc spawner.[/quote]<br>
it takes allot or sometime and work to ‘make’ (code) a cheat button and its physics onto a client. if you dont appreciate it. please get out of this topic. Thanks.</p>

<p>Well, the hardest part would be making it spawn objects. Spawning a fake item or such, wont do anything because it simple wont work, being its a FAKE item. Only objects and noclip are the available working spawns that can be found, but not many have been able to make a client spawn objects. Also, about that “highest bidder” thing, if they have real brains, why wont they just make one. Because that says its a noob that doesnt need to even crash a server, because he knows nothing about one even. Coding a client is only about 50% diferent from a server. Its the same principals, just diferent methods.</p>

Acually, most people dont like them because they get majorly abused. Also, the small-ness of a cheat client is not what we care about, its how people use the powers that it has. More-or-less, if its a decient cheat client tut, we dont care, but how people will abuse it and stuff, we do care.</p>

<p>Hey Hey Hey I didn’t say we had to release the clients. But I reckon showing them off is fine. If you are good enough to make a cheat client you probably have the common sense to only go and harass the nooby servers and even if you dont its a challenge for the owners to find new ways to block the clients.</p>

Yes i know this, because it does not send the sommand in. It just simply says your noclipping to the client. I was just saying that it needs alot more work for it to have my acceptance.</p>
<p>EDIT: This will also ruin this community more. Since we now have cheatclients we can now ruin servers. Creating server to go down, and then more noobs to try to leech, since they believe they are awsome enough to make the owner shut it down.</p>

<p>How is it a good job? He simply added a cheat button, and a client sided item change, does nothing good tbh, because server still reads it as something else. Better options are like, a object and npc spawner.</p>

              <p>(First of all: I’m talking very small. No dupes, spawns, or crashing. Or anything like that.)<br>
Second: This is very simple, and I know that. So don’t flame me for posting something that elite coders should know already.<br>
(* = could be this, could be that. It depends.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Requirements: A client with drop-down menus, possibly the ability to convert small things.<br>
Tested on: Fubergen 2.0, but it should work on any client with drop down menus.<br>
Difficulty: 0/10<br>
Classes modified: Bot.java*, client.java*, Gui.java*, EGUI.java* (Depends on your client.)<br>
</span><br>
OK, let’s get started.</p>
<p>Open up the class with drop-down menus available in it, (For Fubergen 2.0 it’s Bot.java, 4.0 it’s Gui.java)<br>
Now find where it lists the menus. (Should say stuff like “File,” “Server,” maybe “Info”)<br>
Find the value of “File.” It’s most likely 1. In the file, it should say something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">            JMenu jmenu = new JMenu("File");</code></pre>
<p>or maybe it’ll say,</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">            JMenu jmenu1 = new JMenu("File");</code></pre>
<p>If the first one, it’s just default. If the second, the value is 1. You get it, right?<br>
Now in the client, open the menu up.<br>
Find one of the options there, for me - the main option was “Quit.”<br>
So now search in the file for what you found. I searched for “Quit”<br>
Aha! I found this:</p>
<p><code>            String as[] = {
                "Quit"
            };</code><br>
OK now, if you only have one option - I’m going to shed some light onto you. To make more, you have to make ’ “Quit” ’ into, ’ “Quit”, “Option2”, “Option3” ’ Et Cetera.<br>
So, we’re going to make it simple: Allow us to noclip without typing ::noclip so we don’t get banned, let us see the frames per second rate, and allow us to zoom out.<br>
So let’s make it…</p>
<p><code>            String as[] = {
                "Noclip", "FPS", "Zoom", "-", "Quit"
            };</code><br>
(You might not want the dash in there - it’s set up in my client to replace the dash with a separator.)<br>
Now search for what you searched for earlier, again. I searched for “Quit” once more. (By the way - if you haven’t gotten it, it’s ctrl + f)<br>
Aha again!<br>
I found this:</p>
<p><code>            if(s.equalsIgnoreCase("Quit"))
            {
                System.exit(-1);
            }</code><br>
So now, let’s add the codes for noclip, fps, and the zoom.<br>
Add these right above that:</p>
<p>[code] if(s.equals(“Noclip”))<br>
{<br>
for(int k1 = 0; k1 &lt; 4; k1++)<br>
{<br>
for(int i2 = 1; i2 &lt; 103; i2++)<br>
{<br>
for(int k2 = 1; k2 &lt; 103; k2++)<br>
aClass11Array1230[k1].anIntArrayArray294[i2][k2] = 0;</p>
<pre><code>                            }

                        }
		}
</code></pre>
<p>if(s.equalsIgnoreCase(“FPS”))<br>
{<br>
aBoolean1156 = !aBoolean1156;<br>
}<br>
if(s.equalsIgnoreCase(“Zoom”))<br>
{<br>
cameratoggle = !cameratoggle;<br>
}[/code]<br>
Save &amp; Compile.<br>
Now open up your client again, open the file menu - and there they are!<br>
The three new “cheating” options that we added in. Now, this may not be the cheat client you want - but hey, you can Noclip into staff areas and things like that now, see if you’re going to lag, and check if any administrators are watching you.<br>
Enjoy!<br>
