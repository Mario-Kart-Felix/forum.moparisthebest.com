Grab your tools and go! You can do many things in Terraria: make weapons and fight
off a variety of enemies in numerous biomes, dig deep underground to find
accessories, money, and other useful things, gather wood, stone, ores, and other
resources to create everything you need to make the world your own and defend it.
Build a house, a fort, even a castle, and people will move in to live there and perhaps
even sell you different wares to assist you on your journey. But beware, there are even
more challenges awaiting you... Are you up to the task?
