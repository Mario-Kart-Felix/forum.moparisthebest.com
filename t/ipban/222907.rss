    <title>Ipban?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ipban/222907</link>
    <description>ok, now my ipban used to work on my server, and i got rid of some portals here and there, nothing big. but for some reason, ipban doesnt work anymore. i will add it to banndedclips, or use my command. and it will ban them, and ill watch the command prompt and it will say for there new acc that they cant log in because there ip is banned, and it will say they dissconnect, but then it lets them log on there new account anyways! but if they log out, that account will become banned, but they could just do the samething with the new account. could someone please tell me how to fix it, and make it so no one from the ip can log in. thank you</description>

              <p>looks like you’ve take a chunk of the code out. be carefull deleting stuff because you never know what code is above/below it. i suggest deleting your ip ban. and adding a new one.</p>
<p>this may not fix it, but it’s worth a shot, ay?</p>
