    <description>It&#39;s like living n the past. We managed to consume ourinternet in like 2 days them had to get more. It&#39;s too hot to function it&#39;s constantly 25+, if anything needs to get done it takes forever. People take days off because, well why not it&#39;s sunny! (they genuinely take days off and just don&#39;t turn up if it&#39;s a nice day) there are more fast food places than I&#39;ve ever seen before, it&#39;s horrendously americanised and they all can&#39;t drive, you only need to drive for 25 hours then you get awarded a license in WA and everyone drives automatics because they&#39;re gay. Also this is possibly the only place in the world I&#39;ve been to where they hve signs directing you to places that dont exist yet, and they build roads and then just appear to give up on them and just start building another one</description>

<p>Same for us on the western side. Until recently the days haven’t peaked 35 degrees and Christmas was actually bearable to stay outside for the entire day for once.</p>

Uhm, it depends on what state - it’s normally around 16; though, some hick states have it set to 14.</p>
<p>As for accidents, I think it really depends on the driver/culture. I’ve never had an accident, neither has any of my closest friends or girlfriend - it’s not like I’m a granny driver either; I love going &gt; 160 Kph on major highways during dead hours. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I’ve heard of a few accidents happen from some colleagues, however most of them weren’t paying attention or they’re just plain retarded to begin with.</p>

<p>Technically 16 if you jump on it as fast as possible… Although no minors allowed for a year unless you have a licensed driver over 25 in the vehicle as well</p>

<p>In Queensland you get your learners permit at 16, and you have to complete 100 log book hours, some of which must be with a driving instructor which are worth 3 hours for every 1 hour, and 10 hours night driving. If you complete those hours in the first year you can go for your P1 license at 17. Victoria is much the same just you can go for your P1 at 18 after doing 120 hours and you have to take a hazards test. In Victoria you get your permit for 10 years, in Queensland a learners permit is 3 years and a P1 is an optional up to 5 years.<br>
You can also apply for an exemption of years too in Queensland, and wave them the $40 earlier <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>But what I’m saying is: can’t you just forge it?<br>

<p>You can but they cross check the hours and dates with other log books and the weather and what not. You have to have the book approved before you can book your test.[/quote]<br>

<p>How strict are they with the logs (assuming you don’t wave them for $40 after 2 years)?</p>

</aside>
<p>In Queensland you get your learners permit at 16, and you have to complete 100 log book hours, some of which must be with a driving instructor which are worth 3 hours for every 1 hour, and 10 hours night driving. If you complete those hours in the first year you can go for your P1 license at 17. Victoria is much the same just you can go for your P1 at 18 after doing 120 hours and you have to take a hazards test. In Victoria you get your permit for 10 years, in Queensland a learners permit is 3 years and a P1 is an optional up to 5 years.<br>
You can also apply for an exemption of years too in Queensland, and wave them the $40 earlier <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
But what I’m saying is: can’t you just forge it?[/quote]</p>
<p>You can but they cross check the hours and dates with other log books and the weather and what not. You have to have the book approved before you can book your test.</p>

I think with regards to the motorway limit though it’s pretty irrelevant. A you shouldn’t be there B you’ll probably die at 70 anyway. I know you mean the 40 in a 30 zone ads though<br>

<p>the point is the increased reaction travel time and braking time at higher speeds i think, not how likely you are to die if you hit something</p>

itt that cuz you were on a bike you probably didnt collide with something so you probably slid across the floor at like 70 miles an hour right? with leathers on yeah that’d definitely not tickle but its a lot less strenuous on a body than a collision</p>

needs more speed ! i regularly belted my old motor down the m1 at over 100<br>
Also: more australia news, fed some kangaroos and touched a koala, they are really soft! koalas are the laziest mother fuckers in the world though, sleeping for 20 hours a day and eating for the reamining 4, its immense. Erm went sandboarding too, saw a lobster fishing buildingy place thing. still excited to leave this place though, its too hot and not the sort of place i want to come for a holiday.</p>
