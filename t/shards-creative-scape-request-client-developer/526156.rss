    <title>[Shards] Creative-scape request client developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shards-creative-scape-request-client-developer/526156</link>
    <description>R0cky 0wnz needs a client developer to help him. The source is project no-doze and base is shards.

The server always has 100+ players, max we reached is 210 players and is growing rapidly.

Few problems are
1. Random disconnection happens.
2. Random glitch that makes no sense.

If you are interested, I will pm you the website so you can pm the owner on the forums.</description>

<p>Well said and goodluck with shard.  Shitty to use but whatever.  If anything I sugguest he should of used hyperion or Apollo</p>
