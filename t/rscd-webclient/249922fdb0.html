        <p>I asked for help and even sent you a PM. In return I received “Java well, you should know how to download a file.” Real helpful. Could of at least forwarded me to a java manual referencing such a thing. Jaghetermario can’t get anywhere either.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how many people i’ve been sharing it with” No I don’t because 1.) their websites are not advertised with a webclient, 2.) I have not examined their cache directories to see if they match yours, and 3.) I don’t see any released code on any topics that differs from what was released by someone else. The cache downloader has not been made public and the reason is not because you are afraid that others will obtain it and “call it theirs” but for the sole reason of feeling better than the rest who are not at your level of proficiency in this programming language. When I say get off your high horse, that is what I am referring to. You don’t want me to release the code with a clear guide on how to install it because you are afraid that in my doing so, it will make you look like TX; someone who acts high and mighty but cannot be bothered to help the fledgling members. We are not a part of your elite little clique and so we are left in the dark.</p>

I belive they’re not. And i’m not sitting on a high horse, the cache downloader has been released by nemmy, therefor i saw no reason in releasing mine. And what makes you think i’ve released it in a topic or anywhere on a forum? I’ve personally given them a bit of the code time by time, so people actually learn something and don’t leech it all the way.</p>
<p>Look at the RS2 section for example, their tutorials show exactly how to do it and where to do it, that makes noone learn anything.</p>
<p>And it’s not like i’m looking trough my PM’s everyday, and besides i don’t think i answerd your PM hence i havn’t even opened it.</p>
<p>And you don’t think you acted like an asshole when you forwarded this to me? “Great, I’ll be sure to post it everywhere to speed up the process. &lt;3”, that is one reason for not giving you it, what you would’ve done is just giving everyone the already finished code, and making noone learn anything what it does or how it works.</p>
<p>I have nothing against you and i’m not trying to be better than everyone, a webclient source has been released.</p>

<p>People learn if you make an tutorial on it step by step!<br>
Thats how people learn how to setup a server and thats the way peoples learn new stuff these days!<br>
don’t play almighty, be smart and friendly make a fine looking tutorial if you so want people to learn one or two.</p>

<p>I asked for help and even sent you a PM. In return I received “Java well, you should know how to download a file.” Real helpful. Could of at least forwarded me to a java manual referencing such a thing. Jaghetermario can’t get anywhere either.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how many people i’ve been sharing it with” No I don’t because 1.) their websites are not advertised with a webclient, 2.) I have not examined their cache directories to see if they match yours, and 3.) I don’t see any released code on any topics that differs from what was released by someone else. The cache downloader has not been made public and the reason is not because you are afraid that others will obtain it and “call it theirs” but for the sole reason of feeling better than the rest who are not at your level of proficiency in this programming language. When I say get off your high horse, that is what I am referring to. You don’t want me to release the code with a clear guide on how to install it because you are afraid that in my doing so, it will make you look like TX; someone who acts high and mighty but cannot be bothered to help the fledgling members. We are not a part of your elite little clique and so we are left in the dark.</p>
<p>“Don’t judge me without knowing me or my intentions”<br>
I believe they are quite clear.</p>

</aside>
<p>I belive they’re not. And i’m not sitting on a high horse, the cache downloader has been released by nemmy, therefor i saw no reason in releasing mine. And what makes you think i’ve released it in a topic or anywhere on a forum? I’ve personally given them a bit of the code time by time, so people actually learn something and don’t leech it all the way.</p>
<p>Look at the RS2 section for example, their tutorials show exactly how to do it and where to do it, that makes noone learn anything.</p>
<p>And it’s not like i’m looking trough my PM’s everyday, and besides i don’t think i answerd your PM hence i havn’t even opened it.</p>
<p>And you don’t think you acted like an asshole when you forwarded this to me? “Great, I’ll be sure to post it everywhere to speed up the process. &lt;3”, that is one reason for not giving you it, what you would’ve done is just giving everyone the already finished code, and making noone learn anything what it does or how it works.</p>
<p>I have nothing against you and i’m not trying to be better than everyone, a webclient source has been released.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>People learn if you make an tutorial on it step by step!<br>
Thats how people learn how to setup a server and thats the way peoples learn new stuff these days!<br>
don’t play almighty, be smart and friendly make a fine looking tutorial if you so want people to learn one or two.<br>

<p>No not really, becuase applets dont call the Main method. And it has to be downloaded from somewhere?</p>

<p>GameWindow will load the applet the public void int w/e what then reads the mc for the info</p>
<p>LOL<br>
[/quote]<br>
First of all, you probably dont know what i meant with “Main”, do you know what public static void <span class="bbcode-b">Main</span>(String args[]) is?</p>


<p>Oh and that ^, is completly wrong, the first class you should load is MUDCLIENT, if you know what that is. + the width + height is wrong. GJ[/quote]</p>
<p>FYI: If by ‘Main(String[])’ you are referring to the entry point of an application, then I think you’ll find the actual method is ‘main(String[])’. You must also appreciate the fact that this is, as I said, the entry point for an Application. The entry point for an applet is, as previously pointed out by someone, the method ‘init()’ from class Applet.</p>
