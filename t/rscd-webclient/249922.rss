I asked for help and even sent you a PM. In return I received “Java well, you should know how to download a file.” Real helpful. Could of at least forwarded me to a java manual referencing such a thing. Jaghetermario can’t get anywhere either.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how many people i’ve been sharing it with” No I don’t because 1.) their websites are not advertised with a webclient, 2.) I have not examined their cache directories to see if they match yours, and 3.) I don’t see any released code on any topics that differs from what was released by someone else. The cache downloader has not been made public and the reason is not because you are afraid that others will obtain it and “call it theirs” but for the sole reason of feeling better than the rest who are not at your level of proficiency in this programming language. When I say get off your high horse, that is what I am referring to. You don’t want me to release the code with a clear guide on how to install it because you are afraid that in my doing so, it will make you look like TX; someone who acts high and mighty but cannot be bothered to help the fledgling members. We are not a part of your elite little clique and so we are left in the dark.</p>

<p>How hard was that? Tell you what, once you figure it out you’re more then welcome to post a working cache downloader. Then you’ll run into another problem, and then you’ll try to fix it and maybe even release that.

<p>No not really, becuase applets dont call the Main method. And it has to be downloaded from somewhere?</p>

<p>GameWindow will load the applet the public void int w/e what then reads the mc for the info</p>
<p>LOL<br>
[/quote]<br>
First of all, you probably dont know what i meant with “Main”, do you know what public static void <span class="bbcode-b">Main</span>(String args[]) is?</p>


<p>Oh and that ^, is completly wrong, the first class you should load is MUDCLIENT, if you know what that is. + the width + height is wrong. GJ[/quote]</p>
<p>FYI: If by ‘Main(String[])’ you are referring to the entry point of an application, then I think you’ll find the actual method is ‘main(String[])’. You must also appreciate the fact that this is, as I said, the entry point for an Application. The entry point for an applet is, as previously pointed out by someone, the method ‘init()’ from class Applet.</p>

              <p>I asked for help and even sent you a PM. In return I received “Java well, you should know how to download a file.” Real helpful. Could of at least forwarded me to a java manual referencing such a thing. Jaghetermario can’t get anywhere either.</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea how many people i’ve been sharing it with” No I don’t because 1.) their websites are not advertised with a webclient, 2.) I have not examined their cache directories to see if they match yours, and 3.) I don’t see any released code on any topics that differs from what was released by someone else. The cache downloader has not been made public and the reason is not because you are afraid that others will obtain it and “call it theirs” but for the sole reason of feeling better than the rest who are not at your level of proficiency in this programming language. When I say get off your high horse, that is what I am referring to. You don’t want me to release the code with a clear guide on how to install it because you are afraid that in my doing so, it will make you look like TX; someone who acts high and mighty but cannot be bothered to help the fledgling members. We are not a part of your elite little clique and so we are left in the dark.</p>
<p>“Don’t judge me without knowing me or my intentions”<br>
I believe they are quite clear.</p>

<p>This. And Marwolf, who the hell are you to come here and play hero? This is a development forum, thus people who WISH to share things will at their own discretion. If we wanted to be like RS2, we would have tutorials for nearly everything so everyone and their mom can successfully run a server. Do what most people did, learn for yourself instead of depending on others to help you. Fuck those who support leeching, it’s the reason this forum has gone to shit.</p>

Yes, i could release it. But why can’t you go researching a bit and maybe try to figure it out yourself? I mean cmon, it isn’t that hard if you know Java well, you should know how to download a file.</p>

Pretty nice. I wouldn’t release it.  I mean look at what happened to RS2 Private Servers because everyone released every little thing.<br>
[/quote]<br>
This is not “little thing” nobody havent release RSC webclient yet.[/quote]<br>
You should no what I mean.  If you want to release this in any way, give small sniplets of code but let them figure out how to use it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
