    <description> Failure to follow a few simple rules will result in punishment.
Please also read the [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,274273.0.html]forum rules[/url].


  1) [b]Help topics[/b]:  This is not a section for getting help. Do not use this one to ask for help, your topic will be locked. Instead, post in [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,48.0.html]Server Help[/url].

  2) [b]Advertising[/b]:  This section is for showing off (flaunting) your work, not advertising your server and/or forums. Do so and you will be rewarded with a mute or ban.

  3) [b]Development teams[/b]:  None of these in this section. Post them in [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,125.0.html]Server Development Teams[/url] instead.

  4) [b]New topics[/b]: You must post at least a few pictures of your Development. If you do not, we cannot believe you. You may substitute this with a video. Why pictures/video? So you have proof you did something. Also, topic titles [b]must[/b] follow [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,314359]this[/url].

  5) [b]Projects[/b]: This is not the place to post minor projects, such as, changing spawn locations, adding a few commands then saying you will release. We want something more major than that, seeing as all you do to change spawn locations is change a number and you&#39;re done. We don&#39;t want to see that you can change a number, we want to see that you can create something that will change the server in such a way that it&#39;ll make it funner and more enjoyable for the players, or that you can change the game code to make it more efficient at doing a certain task or to have more stability overall.
   

I&#39;ll leave this open for now, to see your opinions and any other suggestions for different rules.</description>
