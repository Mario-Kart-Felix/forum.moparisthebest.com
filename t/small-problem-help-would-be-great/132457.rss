    <description>[code]Aerocursion Kingdom has started
ClientHandler: Accepted from localhost
Ident: bryan
[client-1-bryan]: playerCommand: noclip
bryan has logged off.
Game saved for player bryan

[/code]

When a person logs in, it will say your account is allready logged in, Then the second time they click they will log in. When it says your acc is allready logged in, They log in as _, then log in as their own guy, But the _ doesnt stay on. So does anyone know whats causing that?</description>
