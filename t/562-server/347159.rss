    <title>562 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-server/347159</link>
    <description>Hi all! My friend just created new 562 server but we have some problems.

1. Need to add good, without bugs monsters(like tormented demons, corporeal beast, GWD monsters)
2. The wild zone doesn&#39;t got wild level marks( the wild I mean like in PvP worlds)
3. Need to fix items stats and hits. its very complicated because hits very frequent are 0. 
4. There is problem with wild pking. When attack the player doesn&#39;t respond to command. 
5. There is problem with prayers when fighting boss e.g. General Graador. The anti-melee prayer doesn&#39;t work. I think all others too :(

I want to please all to somehow fix these problems and write down codes because I&#39; m not a good coder.

Thanks for help :) Anyone?</description>
