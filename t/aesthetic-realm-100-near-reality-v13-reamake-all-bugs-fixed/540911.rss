[COLOR=&quot;#00FF00&quot;]Why you should join Aesthetic Realm[/COLOR]

It is our goal to make your playing experience the best it can be. Our developer is knowledgeable and capable of doing things that most other servers could only dream of. 
We guarantee an unforgettable experience filled with many journeys along the way. Whether you destroy gigantic bosses, drop your opponents in wilderness, establish wealth like never seen before, or skill harder than none other, we look forward to welcoming you to your new home. Have fun playing Aesthetic-Realm!

[COLOR=&quot;#00FF00&quot;]Active Black Market[/COLOR]

Our black market is one of the most unique systems in all the RSPS. You can quickly gain wealth and head straight into game play with our unique black market. We, unlike most, allow our players to sell their hard earned wealth if they choose to. We allow our currency (ARGP) to be traded for virtually anything except for real life cash!


What is BloodLust?

Bloodlust is essentially a wilderness competition between registered teams. Each team can have up to ten players, an official captain, and their own team banner. Each team has a specific rating based on the amount of kills and other factors. The team that has the highest rating at the end of the season wins IRL $ and has exclusive bragging rights to winning that respective season! So what are you waiting for? Bring your clan and see if you can win BloodLust!
