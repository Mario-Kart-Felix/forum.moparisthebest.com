    <title>How to make a WebClient after security update (And Java 8) - DogeSign</title>

As some of you may know, A (fairly) recent Java update has made it extremely awkward for users to play RuneScape Private Server Webclients with self-signed certificates. To allow users to play, you will need to pay sometimes between $150 to $200, be a registered company AND provide your actual information in order to get an overpriced certificate.
At the moment, this may be fixed by simply changing the security level to medium. Whilst this works, Java 8 will remove the capability to run self-signed code fully.
But fear not! Patrick Star has the solution!

DogeSign is a centralized certificate authority, signing certificates for free in order to ensure continuity of webclients for the foreseeable future!
Below is an informative paragraph about how to import CA&#39;s to your Java installation.
[SPOILER=much informative]
[B][SIZE=5]Method 1: Easy Installer[/SIZE][/B]
1) Download [url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45427687/dogesign.jar]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45427687/dogesign.jar[/url]  (Source code available here: [url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45427687/setup-src.zip]https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45427687/setup-src.zip[/url] )
2) Run
3) Input Java&#39;s Keystore Password (defaults to changeit. If you don&#39;t know what this is, you should probably leave it as changeit)
4) Done!
[B][SIZE=5]Method 2: Manually Adding[/SIZE][/B]
1) Download the certificate for the CA. DogeSign&#39;s CRT can be found here: [url=http://puu.sh/7lAeI.crt]http://puu.sh/7lAeI.crt[/url]
2) For Windows users, Open control panel and search for Java

Open the appropriate Java configuration.
3) Go to the security tab

6) Select &quot;Secure Site CA&quot; in the dropdown box, and repeat step 5.

7) Press Close, Apply, OK.
You&#39;ve now added a certificate authority!
[/SPOILER]

If you&#39;re the owner of a private server, and would like to get a signed certificate for your web browser, Follow the instructions below.
[SPOILER=so success]
Create a certificate and private key pair. This can be done using any tool of your choice or the below command line:
[code]
keytool -genkey -dname &quot;CN=SuperFunScape, OU=Uniqueness, O=Old School Remake Super Fun Unique Best Server, ST=Many Server, C=RS&quot; -validity 365 -alias ServerName -keypass XXZZXX -keystore ServerName.ks -storepass XXYYXX
[/code]
It&#39;s important that the country code is set to RS. All of the other fields are irrelevant, and should reflect your server. Validity should only be 365 days.
Create a certificate sign request for the generated certificate / keypair
[code]
keytool -certreq -alias ServerName -file ServerName_csr.pem -keypass XXZZXX -keystore ServerName.ks -storepass XXYYXX
[/code]

And PM me the ServerName_csr.pem file.
When I get around to it, I will sign this and respond with a signed one. You can then use this just like any other self-signed certificate.
Feel free to copy the instructions in the other spoiler to instruct your users how to trust our certificate.
[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER=very responsibility]
If a webclient has a backdoor in any way using one of DogeSign&#39;s signed certificates, Download the jar file and PM me it. I will then verify the backdoor and revoke the certificate. This will block all users from being able to load their client.
[/SPOILER]

[B]What&#39;s the point of this? Why not just get users to add a certificate per server?[/B]

Because that wastes the users time. An application could easily be made to automate this process, but it&#39;s still more effort than adding one certificate one time. Additionally, this provides a level of security for the users, as it allows me to manually block backdoored clients.
