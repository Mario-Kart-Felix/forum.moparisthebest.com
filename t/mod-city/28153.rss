    <title>Mod city?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mod-city/28153</link>
    <description>ok well this is a pic of my mod city bank just the bank and i was wondering if there was a way that i could change the floors that are black to what i choose. so if i wanted it to look brown it would look brown. also if someone knows how to build this into client side instead of using fedexers that would be cool. this is just the bank there is going to be more to the city lol i just want to figure everything out first then ill build the rest.
