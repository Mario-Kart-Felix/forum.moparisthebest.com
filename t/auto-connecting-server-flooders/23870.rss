    <title>Auto Connecting Server Flooders?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/auto-connecting-server-flooders/23870</link>
    <description>I have a bunch of people who connect to my server (but not really connect, meaning they never log in). What they are doing I guess is creating a lot of blank spaces and NULLS in my game to cause it to lag and be come full faster. I banned about over 60 of their almost random IP addresses, and yet more and more just come. I switch my IP to my MAC Ip address and suddenly they are gone (assuming they are just attacking my current IP address). Anyone know any mechanisms to rid of these guys? I mean, I already have it so you need to register at my website before you can log on my server, but now it&#39;s getting even more complicated to rid of these guys.. Anyone can help? Anyone know what what kind of attack this is and what they are doing so I can code against it?

Thanks/</description>

              <p>Its simple to fix yet everyone is too stupid to understand.</p>
<p>Just dispose all those nulls and reuse them for new players connecting lets say playerID 33 disconnected he turns into a null next player to connect should get playerID 33 but he wont… thats why rs2 programming is shit atm people have to learn to delete useless classes in memory or they will stuff up your pc.</p>
