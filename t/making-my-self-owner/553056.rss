Try opening your character file and changing the playerRight…</p>
<p>Usually, it’ll be something like this<br>
0 - player<br>
1 - mod<br>
2 - admin<br>
3 - owner/co-owner<br>
4- donator (if the coder has added that)<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>that’ll work awesome for a 317 lol but if you payed attention he mentioned hes using rune evo, which is like a 718/742 whatever it is, not really sure. but for 718+ I know it’s not like that… i might sound like an ass but im not trying, at all bruh lol<br>
but… to answer your question… navigate to the player.java (99.8% sure its this file, might be wrong… :/) and look for something that looks like this</p>
<p><code>if (username.equalsIgnoreCase("Previous Owner's Username")) 
           {
            rights = 2;
}</code></p>
<p>and just change the according info… like the name and rights.[/quote]</p>
<p>Congrats to you for actually correcting me and helping him!<br>
xD I didn’t realize he was using 700+, and I never have used 700+. I have only used 317-637, and I assumed that source was a 317 or PI. :palm: Thank you haha</p>
