~Hey guys Pvm Santa here,
Lately I&#39;ve been browsing through a lot of the old source threads looking for the old Allstarscape source.
And I just recently found it.
But I&#39;m stuck on which Client I use for the source.
So if someone could point me in the right direction please and thank you!</description>
