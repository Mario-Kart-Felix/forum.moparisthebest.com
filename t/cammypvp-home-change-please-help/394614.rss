    <title>Cammypvp home change please help!</title>

    <description>Hello, I have cammypvp source and its 317, the current safezone is cammy bank and I wanna change the location of the safe spot. Here is where i put it:

public boolean nonWildPvP() {
      if ((absX &gt;= 1234 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 1234 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 1234 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 1234) || (absX &gt;= 1234 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 1234 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 1234 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 1234)) {
            return true;
         } else {
            return true;
      }
   }
Those arent the real location of what I want but I saved and compiled and it didnt work. I am not sure why it didn&#39;t work. Everything compiled correctly too.

Are the locations for the safe spot suppose to be different like i took the locations from cammy bank and replaced them with mine... the cammy bank is pvp now. But my safe spot isnt safe. :/</description>
