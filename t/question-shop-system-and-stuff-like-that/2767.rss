    <title>[question] Shop system and stuff like that</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-shop-system-and-stuff-like-that/2767</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m a little bored so I thought I may as well ask this because I&#39;ve been wondering for a while.

So first of all, one thing I want to do when I&#39;m older is own a large website. I want to own a site similar to turbosquid.com to make a living off of. I basically just want to own my own business in 3d modelling, and general game design. But I dont have much intention on learning php and stuff...

So I need to know how much I would expect to pay someone to make the following:

A very very secure and advanced shop system. There would be two different shops, one where you can simply buy the models and model packs I have made, and another where you can buy other users models. 

Any user could come on, make a profile and their own shop. From there they can upload 3d models and textures, instantly. They would have to select the file type it is(in a drop down menu) and give it a description and stuff(so the search feature can find it). They would also have to say how many polygons, if its animated or not, and all that information, and they could upload screenshots of the models as well. If it was a texture, a watermark would automatically be placed on it. Their shop accounts would also work on the forums so that they dont have to register more then once. In their account they have to specify their paypal account too. So then when a user purchases a model from them, 10% of that money would be sent to me(turbosquid takes 50% :o ) Any user on the site could use a search button to look for the model they want. 
I am not so great at explaining everything, but hopefully you get the general idea of it all. I was wondering how much money that&#39;d cost to hire someone? I was thinking 300-500 dollars?
Take a look at [url=http://turbosquid.com/]Turbosquid[/url]

That is pretty much how it would be set up.</description>

<p>so say</p>
<p>ABC<br>
would become BCDDEFEFG</p>
<p>repeat that 3 times</p>
<p>then that would make a HUGE pass 3 letter pass is 3<em>3</em>3*3 or 81 chars then take the first 64 of that (64 bit pass) and you got a pass that is never reversable unless u mod the source code to retrieve the pass by not cutting the pass to 64 but that would be illegeal</p>
<p>but u wouldnt do that. Also if some1 stole the DB theyd not ahve the whole pass so they could never crack it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> only the web host and site owner could. YOu could always md5 the 64 bit pass making really never bruteforce-able or crackable for more security so they ocould never do anything abut it</p>

<p>Jme if it’s worth 500 dollars and you will make a living off it, then your 500 dollars is junk compared to how much money you would make… if it’s a success. So maybe if you don’t even want to spend 500 dollars try picking up on PHP. It’s really not that hard.</p>

<p>I guess your right.</p>
<p>I dont want to learn php, or any language anymore. As soon as my game is done Im quitting programming, and going to be a 3d modeller <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> It’s a lot more fun and I still love game design.</p>

|-Comment<br>

<p>so the db is really ez the hard part is the secuirty and makeing each person their own shop (not hard, same theory as people own profile)</p>
<p>as for paypal never touched the thing</p>
<p>for registering on forums , mod a register function for ur site to also trigger the phpbb register function (also ez)</p>
<p>i could do this site but my short attention span and school takes up my time</p>
<p>If u still want this done and dont have any one this summer contact me (i dont design pages just write the backend and front end, You can mod my code into your site easily just copy and paste)</p>
