    <description>My idea is Reborn. When you are reborn, you combat stats go back to level 50 but all of your attack and defence stats are increaced by 50. To get raborn you must have all cb stats level 90 and higher, 116 and higher for ones where max is more than 99, and complete a certain quest. Then you become reborn. If anyone has any comments on this idea plz post them. 

If you think this idea is dumb, you can post too, just dont be rude and just state your oppinion.</description>
