    <title>Would this make Hosting better?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-this-make-hosting-better/240848</link>
    <description>I&#39;m so tired, every time the server decides to generate 20 nulls, I get this in my No-Ip and my server crashes.

This is how it looks:

Sorry for the quality, saved as .jpg by accident.

So, if I were to uninstall DUC, would I still be able to host without the IP&#39;s crashing? Or do I need DUC? Cause one time, someone said it was useless... 

Alright, thanks.</description>
