    <description>[center][size=20pt]Welcome to PhobiaScape [Under Development] [/size][/center]

Hey guys, my name is Jared.  I am incredibly new to moparscape as having an account goes, but I do visit it quite often.  Anyways, this is going to be the server development for the server I am creating called PhobiaScape! 

[center][size=20pt] About Phobia in General [/size][/center]

Okay, so Phobia is basically a gaming host type deal that me and my friend Adam have.  Currently we have one dedicated custom server (yes server not a VPS) that is located in NYC in a datacenter.  We currently host:

~CoD 4: Promod
~Minecraft: Survival with and without plugins

and soon to be this server!  

So this is a big leap forward with Phobia seeing as we haven&#39;t added games in a while.  This will be my first time coding RSPS, but don&#39;t worry, I have a inkling of knowledge, and I hate to be spoon-fed almost as much as the people on this forum hate to spoon-feed.   :D

Red = Not Started
Blue = Under Development
Green = Finished *Of course tweaks may still occur*

 ::help command teleports to a location with NPC that have dialogue to help new users out 
 Complete Commands Rewrite:  Reason Being was PlayerRights was being messed up in the pre-written file. 
 Complete Use of Spellbooks:  Lunar is not showing the images of spells for some reason.  Others work fine.  
 Staff Zone and Donor Zone 
 Getting kick to work:  Right now just disconnects then reconnects instantly 
 Ban is created, IPBan is not (Currently just box banning from our dedicated server

 Custom Quests (3) to get Quest Cape 
 Changing the teleports 
 Combat System Rewrite:  Reason Being a Few Factors aren&#39;t working correctly 
 Webclient to be hosted at www.gophobia.com 
 Custom Boss Fights i.e. Banker just before meeting KBD 
 Banker Dialogue 
 Setting a PIN for your Bank 
 Cleaning up Code 
 Better Drop Rates for an ECO server 
 Better EXP Rates *To be Decided On* 
 Making teleports look at Spell book and use correct teleport animation 


Basically I will be adding a ton more RED&#39;s to this list, and hopefully they will be turning green soon!  Please give me support, because even if it doesn&#39;t sound like the best server ever, it is my first time ever trying.  Also leave some tips / tricks if you would like to help me out!

[center][size=20pt] Update Reel [/size][/center]

This will be an area where I will put the newest things added, I will keep the recent 5 items on here:

1. Added New Commands.  Still don&#39;t know if my method is okay, but no one answered my thread on switches :D

2. 

3.

4.

5.

Client: Generic PI Client (sorry for no links =/)

Green = I am working

Red = I am not working

 I am currently not working on the server 
Due to immature DDoSers lol  Dealing with the problem shortly.


Thanks to everyone who replies!
