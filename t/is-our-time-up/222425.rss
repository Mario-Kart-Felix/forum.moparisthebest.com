    <title>Is our &quot;time up&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-our-time-up/222425</link>
    <description>I should have thought a lot more before making this topic...but I think I needed to.

I don&#39;t know about any of you, but my friends(most programmers), are the same. I got really non-sociable being so involved with RuneScape, then Private servers. I stopped skating...Which is what I used to do all the time. This coding shit consumes me...And I noticed more and more are quitting, but this time...it&#39;s all at once. I had and still do have myself convinced I want to get my life back and give this all up when school starts again. But I doubt I will...I wonder if it was just a stupid idea to get involved in private servers. Look at how pathetic we are...Striving to make our on version of a game some think is ruined...But it&#39;s never ending. And we do not really benefit from it at all. I used to think about coding and new methods and new ways to add things new things to improve when I was bored, or wasn&#39;t here basically. I mean, it&#39;s 2:30 AM in the morning and I&#39;m doing this...I don&#39;t even talk to my friends anymore and I barely talked to anyone during the whole school year. Maybe it&#39;s time to give all of this up and move on...Without the crashers and botnetters and DoSers...It&#39;s a waste. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll leave or not, [b] but if you&#39;re new, I suggest you leave now before you waste your time...[/b]
I&#39;m sorry that this is not in the right section, but I needed to say this.

[b]Codeusa is doing, and thinks the same. I guess I am not the only one.</description>

Yeah, but you guys aren’t getting my point, Why are we racing Jagex copying everything they do trying to make our own version…<br>
[/quote]<br>
How are we racing Jagex? We’re not even moving from 317.[/quote]<br>
It doesn’t matter because we are trying to do everything they do, such as moving to a 474, 503, getting something like godsword specs for a 317 or 377. Because we are not moving, does not mean we are not trying.</p>

              <p>We aren’t racing jagex at all. in fact, how can we really? We took this idea from them, well not literaly but i guess if you think about it, we copied it. but it wasnt to screw Jagex or any other private server user over. No one means or wants to have their life consumed by some game programing, and you don’t have to. Like Yz said, take a break bro. Come back if you want, and when you do, it could be like a whole new experience. The reason i think everyone makes private servers is obvious really, we want to customize them to how we would want to play this game. It’s what we want, not that it wants you. the game can’t control you if you control the game, and yourself. We’ve made a comunity, a whole new world away from a world, that doesnt mean you have to dedicate your life to it? and im sure thats not what you meant to come off as Pat, but its a view of it. If you look past the negatives, theres a way to get past what you think of the game and balance your real life and well… programing life? lol. just take a break, i know i would. Actualy i have.</p>
<p>haha, i kinda look at this and realize im in the Help section. i came here to help some poor sap, and hopefully i did ^-^ GL Pat</p>

to improve there server and make it better…people want to pk like they did along time ago be for bounty hunter…so they add the new and yet they keep the old stuff like pking…</p>

Sometimes I go dirtbike with my dad and brother, anyways I’m not worried about the public, or how much time I spend…It’s just that it’s never ending, we’re racing professional programmers…We’re trying to make our own version of the game we like to play, it’s near pointless and as I said, more and more of my friends are quitting and I’m starting to realize why, finally.</p>

              <p>If you’re worried about how much you spend programming or on these forums just take a break, or limit your hours. I’m not that particularly worried about that, as when I’m not on these forums I’m either training/competing or at school. It doesn’t matter, because I race Motocross and do Muay-Thai, so my parents don’t worry about it.</p>
<p>Just my opinion: it’s up to you. If you’re doing this from the thought of what the public sees you as, as I am sure you are one of those outcast of society skateboarders, who wears his hat off to the side… Humor aside, who cares what the public views you as? The public will only go against you. Your friends? So your friends are worried about how unsocial you are… I don’t think they can be that good of mates of yours, then.</p>

              <p>I should have thought a lot more before making this topic…but I think I needed to.</p>
<p>I don’t know about any of you, but my friends(most programmers), are the same. I got really non-sociable being so involved with RuneScape, then Private servers. I stopped skating…Which is what I used to do all the time. This coding shit consumes me…And I noticed more and more are quitting, but this time…it’s all at once. I had and still do have myself convinced I want to get my life back and give this all up when school starts again. But I doubt I will…I wonder if it was just a stupid idea to get involved in private servers. Look at how pathetic we are…Striving to make our on version of a game some think is ruined…But it’s never ending. And we do not really benefit from it at all. I used to think about coding and new methods and new ways to add things new things to improve when I was bored, or wasn’t here basically. I mean, it’s 2:30 AM in the morning and I’m doing this…I don’t even talk to my friends anymore and I barely talked to anyone during the whole school year. Maybe it’s time to give all of this up and move on…Without the crashers and botnetters and DoSers…It’s a waste. I don’t know if I’ll leave or not, <span class="bbcode-b"> but if you’re new, I suggest you leave now before you waste your time…</span><br>
I’m sorry that this is not in the right section, but I needed to say this.</p>
<p>[b]Codeusa is doing, and thinks the same. I guess I am not the only one.</p>
