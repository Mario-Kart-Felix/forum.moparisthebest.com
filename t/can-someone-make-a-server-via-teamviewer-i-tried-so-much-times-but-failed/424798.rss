    <title>Can someone make a server via Teamviewer? (I tried so much times but failed)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-make-a-server-via-teamviewer-i-tried-so-much-times-but-failed/424798</link>
    <description>I failed many, many times trying to make a private server. And I give it up, it never works! I mean, one time it did with hamachi, but I need a better server + client. Maybe someone can make a server for me? 

The editing of the server I will do myself like the gamename and stuff. The only thing I want you to do is downloading a working source and client and then make it so it connects to my no-ip connection. 

Please, this is not because I am lazy, but I just don&#39;t want to try it again and again because I fail everytime. 

The guy who will help me may get admin ranked on the server, if he wants. Or else just honor from me. xD</description>
