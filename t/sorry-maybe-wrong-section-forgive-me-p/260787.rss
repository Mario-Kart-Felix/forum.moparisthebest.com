<p>Being there is no section for it, I would think this section would be considered fine.</p>

              <p>Okay, i can’t walk away from this without informing everyone.</p>
<p>winterLove is a guy first of all, and he wasn’t the “only one” to create “the first source”. He was just one of the only one’s to release the beginning of rs emulation.</p>
<p>You’re completely ignorant if you’re claiming to be able to criticize winterLove’s work. RS emulation was for <span class="bbcode-u">EMULATION</span> not reproduction. People have said before winterLove would be disappointed if he saw what we’ve created with his work. I really don’t even know half of the story on how all of this came about, but I kno he didn’t plan on people mass releasing reproductions of his source on RSPS forums such as mscp.</p>
