    <title>Love gaming? Look here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/love-gaming-look-here/410894</link>
    <description>Hello,

This is going to be a short and simple thread about what me and my friend are planning to do and what we are looking for.

Me and a close friend have been thinking for a long period of time that there is something missing in the gaming market and then one day it suddenly came to us that the entire scene is missing a place where we can all congregate and find reviews on the latest games, meet fellow players of your favourite games, hear all the latest gossip from gaming companies, share a game you are working on and most of all have a truly social place to keep in touch with people and share your personal gaming experiences or learn of other peoples!

So what is it that we are creating? To put it simply, a gaming social network.
Now you may be asking yourself &quot;What use is telling us this&quot; Well I&#39;ll tell you why, we are looking for people to get involved in the creation of the website!


[center][size=14pt]What we are currently looking for[/size][/center]


[ul][*]People with large amounts of experience in designing the graphical end of a website (or have great talent in graphical design).
[*]People with access to decent servers that would be able to host the site/store project data during the building process.
[*]People with experience/power to advertise us when the time comes.
[*]People with real passion in everything they work on.
[*]People with a large amount of experience in ROR.[/ul]



Now the core idea of this entire project would obviously be based around the social network, building up a real network for people to meet, learn and enjoy gaming properly without being restricted to the same old cliche of uninteresting forums full of angry children spamming, flaming and raging but don&#39;t worry all your forum addicts, we would obviously not be getting rid of the good old fashioned forums/boards, but just think of all the additional bonus&#39; you are opening yourself up to by entering the social networking scene.

Since posting this I have had a lot of people going on about how a gaming community is nothing new but I don&#39;t think I originally explained properly what was unique about this project so let me do so now.
This project is not simply a bunch of boards/forums and a little bit of a profile for you to mess about on showing what games you are playing etc... It would be a site where real life friends could communicate about their gaming experiences, new games they have purchased and the such while still having the whole social aspect of still being able to communicate about personal lives and such but not limiting ourselves to that as you may just think &quot;oh what a shitty thing, might as well stay on facebook&quot; we will facilitate the ability to organize large events in gaming via the forums in which you would meet new people to add onto the more social aspect of the site that would allow you to keep in better contact with the members rather than just over a private messaging system as most gaming sites have. I think the key idea here is, having the large community for large scale gaming and sharing but also having a social aspect to the website that would allow it to be a more personal experience that gaming websites are currently missing. 

So now you have an idea what we are about and what we want to do in the future, if you&#39;re interested and want to hear more about this project please fill in the following form.

Or if you don&#39;t feel like doing that you may join us on our IRC channel by clicking [url=http://chat.strictfp.com/?channels=social.gaming]&gt;&gt; here &lt;&lt;[/url]
Please allow 24 hours for me to get back to you, I will try and reply ASAP.

[quote=&quot;SpeedIsMeh&quot;]Hi guys, 
I am working on this project. The idea is to create an entire social network for gamers where they can meet other gamers, plan events, share their own games and discover new games. We&#39;ve decided upon programming the site using ruby on rails and we are merely looking for anyone who is interested to help. We&#39;re not asking for anyone to do all the work for us. We already have a small group of able programmers and we really just need several people who will help out as it is quite a large project. Due to a lack of resources we cannot guarantee any payments currently but we will try to pay anyone who decides to help.
tl;dr we&#39;re not clueless half-wit fucks like many people who would try something like this[/quote]</description>

Didn’t I say that payment cannot be guaranteed and that we’re looking for people that will be interested in the project and passionate about it? We’re not promising payment but we’re not promising nonpayment. Also I doubt many people from this community are good enough programmers to be able to get a paid job that involves programming.<br>
So, I shall clarify once again, we’re not looking for volunteers but for those who would be willing to work alongside our current (very small) development team in creating the front end and helping to program the inner workings of the site with the potential to get paid.</p>

<p>Please don’t get me wrong, we are going to be putting in a massive amount of money/energy/time/work into this, but we simply can not physically do a project this large on our own and we are looking for people with the same kind of passion we share. We in no way want to just hire people out to do all of our work, we wish for people to put in as much work as we will granted, but we will be getting our hands dirty from the word go.</p>

if you had any sense of logic, earnings would be relative to work done. they wouldn’t give you the same amount of money for doing one thing and give someone else the same amount for doing more things just because you’ve both been ‘employed’ for the same amount of time. also, OP is quite the opposite to what you predicted.</p>

I am working on this project. The idea is to create an entire social network for gamers where they can meet other gamers, plan events, share their own games and discover new games. We’ve decided upon programming the site using ruby on rails and we are merely looking for anyone who is interested to help. We’re not asking for anyone to do all the work for us. We already have a small group of able programmers and we really just need several people who will help out as it is quite a large project. Due to a lack of resources we cannot guarantee any payments currently but we will try to pay anyone who decides to help.<br>
tl;dr we’re not clueless half-wit fucks like many people who would try something like this[/quote]List prices for ‘paying’ these people. My guess is your both 14, with no employment or source of income.</p>

<p>Those are not social networking gaming sites, they are simply forums. You don’t seem to understand the idea of this.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>IGN gets interviews with huge gaming companies, they get to be the first to review new games before they’re even released, they are far more than just a forum.  Hell, IGN stands for International Gaming Network.  This idea isn’t original at all.[/quote]</p>
<p>You simply don’t seem to grasp the idea, we are not offering a group of people who review games with some forums, we are looking into creating the first real social networking site based around gaming. I’m not sure how much clearer I can explain this. If you can direct me to a site that actually has a real social networking aspect involved in it that isn’t simply a bunch of posts reviewing games and such and aimed at the <a href="http://xfire.com" rel="nofollow noopener">xfire.com</a> post, that is sort of the idea but not quite what I mean, also Blake you do know me from IRC just not under this alias.</p>

Nobody who is “lots of experience, very good, blahblahblah” is going to help a junior member, they have better things to do. And the thread is titled “love gaming? Look here,” not “Love writing games? Look here.”<br>
And this probably belongs in General Programming, but I could be wrong.<br>

<p>I am looking for people who are interested searching out a project, my status on this community should not effect how people feel about a project (although it may do) also, I have not at any point mentioned writing a game <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Those are not social networking gaming sites, they are simply forums. You don’t seem to understand the idea of this.[/quote]</p>
<p>IGN gets interviews with huge gaming companies, they get to be the first to review new games before they’re even released, they are far more than just a forum.  Hell, IGN stands for International Gaming Network.  This idea isn’t original at all.</p>

<p>What about things like Steam, Newgrounds, BYOND, etc.</p>

<p>I don’t think I clearly got my point across properly.</p>
<p>Yes there are sites that are in a sense a “social network” but there are no true social networking gaming sites, think of it in a sense of google+ or facebook for gamers.</p>
<p>Newgrounds is aimed only at flash games/videos/audio and doesn’t have a real sense of “come here and meet people, organize gaming events on some of the most popular games around” and steam is based around people buying games, not so much a network of friends who play games, share what they love and hate about things and show off their own work (we are planning on working closely with indie gaming as we heavily support it.)</p>

You’re fucking stupid if you just assume that people will “hop on board” <span class="bbcode-i">your</span> project and let you reap all the benefits while they do all of the graphics work and programming.
