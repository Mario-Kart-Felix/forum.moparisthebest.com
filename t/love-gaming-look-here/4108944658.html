if you had any sense of logic, earnings would be relative to work done. they wouldn‚Äôt give you the same amount of money for doing one thing and give someone else the same amount for doing more things just because you‚Äôve both been ‚Äòemployed‚Äô for the same amount of time. also, OP is quite the opposite to what you predicted.</p>

<p>Please don‚Äôt get me wrong, we are going to be putting in a massive amount of money/energy/time/work into this, but we simply can not physically do a project this large on our own and we are looking for people with the same kind of passion we share. We in no way want to just hire people out to do all of our work, we wish for people to put in as much work as we will granted, but we will be getting our hands dirty from the word go.</p>

Hi guys,<br>
I am working on this project. The idea is to create an entire social network for gamers where they can meet other gamers, plan events, share their own games and discover new games. We‚Äôve decided upon programming the site using ruby on rails and we are merely looking for anyone who is interested to help. We‚Äôre not asking for anyone to do all the work for us. We already have a small group of able programmers and we really just need several people who will help out as it is quite a large project. Due to a lack of resources we cannot guarantee any payments currently but we will try to pay anyone who decides to help.<br>
tl;dr we‚Äôre not clueless half-wit fucks like many people who would try something like this<br>
[/quote]List prices for ‚Äòpaying‚Äô these people. My guess is your both 14, with no employment or source of income.[/quote]<br>
Didn‚Äôt I say that payment cannot be guaranteed and that we‚Äôre looking for people that will be interested in the project and passionate about it? We‚Äôre not promising payment but we‚Äôre not promising nonpayment. Also I doubt many people from this community are good enough programmers to be able to get a paid job that involves programming.<br>
So, I shall clarify once again, we‚Äôre not looking for volunteers but for those who would be willing to work alongside our current (very small) development team in creating the front end and helping to program the inner workings of the site with the potential to get paid.</p>
