    <title>Problem with logging on my server PLEASE HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-logging-on-my-server-please-help/106481</link>
    <description>Ok i made my server. I ran it on my compiler thing. It said its running successful blah blah blah. Now in the tut it says to make the IP localhost? So i did that, now it logs me in the server (hybridscape )without a source. i picked satans isle for a source. It logs me in the mining area without a source.



Earlier i had success with this. I was just messing around and i got in satans isle. Now i cant do it again . Anyone please help/.

can someone tell me what ping i should use what ip and port?</description>

<p><code>public static int serverlistenerPort = </code> and the numbers after is the port</p>
