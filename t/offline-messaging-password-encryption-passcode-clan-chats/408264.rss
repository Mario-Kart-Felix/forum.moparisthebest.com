    <title>Offline messaging? Password encryption? Passcode clan chats?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/offline-messaging-password-encryption-passcode-clan-chats/408264</link>
    <description>Hi guys, thanks for looking first of all.

Okay I was wondering if there is a way to bring offline messaging, so if I was to PM a user it would hold all messages until they get online. It sounds to me like a heavy background coding, and I&#39;m still learning how java works (I can do PHP and some C++) so I&#39;m not a complete noob I&#39;ll be programming this myself soon.

I think my server is pi running version 317.

Also is there a way to encrypt the user passwords with MD5 or at least Base64? And is there a way to code-protect clans? I was thinking about making an admin only clan chat.

Thanks loads,
Ste.

You want to make it save offline messages?  Pretty simple if you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Encrypt the passwords? There was a tutorial or a snippet on how to un-Ecrypt the passwords, so just work backwards.</p>
<p>and admin only clans? Add a playerRights check.</p>
