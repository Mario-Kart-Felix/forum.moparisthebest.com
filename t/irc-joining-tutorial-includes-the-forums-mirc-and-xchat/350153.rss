    <description>[center][b][size=36pt]MoparScape IRC![/size][/b]

So lets get started... You may be asking yourself, &quot;What is this &quot;IRC&quot; you speak of?&quot; Well let me explain. Basically IRC is a chat where you can chat with many users of the [url=http://Moparscape.org/smf]Moparscape.org/smf[/url] forums, as well as get server help and advice!

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, here&#39;s some more info.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of real-time Internet chat or synchronous conferencing. It is mainly designed for group (many-to-many) communication in discussion forums called channels, but also allows one-to-one communication via private message and data transfers via Direct Client-to-Client.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So you probably didn&#39;t understand anything mentioned above, but thats okay! IRC is in no way difficult to use!

Lets get started on how to join and start chatting with other forum users! The first part of this will cater to users who already have experience with IRC, but fear not, a newbie tutorial will follow!

[b]IRC Servers as of March 9, 2013:[/b]
irc.moparisthebest.com

[b]Official MoparScape channel:[/b]
#Moparscape

Our IRC network has the same commands as any other network would, so if you use SwiftIRC, Rizon, Freenode, ETC...you&#39;ll be fine with commands.

[b][shadow=blue,left]NEW USER TUTORIAL[/shadow][/b]

So you want to join in on the fun discussion and action that takes part on our IRC. Well first you&#39;ll have to make your big choice of what client you want to use. The two most popular IRC clients are XCHAT and MIRC, or if you don&#39;t wish to download a client you can use the handy IRC Chat option on the Moparscape forums! 

[url=http://www.mirc.com/]mIRC[/url]---&gt;FREE
[url=http://xchat.org/]XCHAT[/url]---&gt; 30 DAY EVALUATION. If you like XCHAT, then try [url=http://www.silverex.org/download/]XCHAT2[/url] for free
[url=https://irc.moparisthebest.xxx:9090/]Browser based chat[/url]---&gt;Free &amp; easy...No download required!

[b][shadow=yellow,left]mIRC[/shadow][/b]
So if you&#39;ve chosen mIRC to be your client, here is a full tutorial on how to get you familiar with it!

After downloading and installing it, you will come to a screen like this:
[IMG]http://i26.tinypic.com/equlap.jpg[/img]

At that screen, you should input all the information requested. When putting in your full name and email, you do not need to use your real information. For nickname, chose your chosen nickname, and the alternative is just a back up name in case your name is taken.

Press ok, than close out of that screen. Your should now see your full mIRC client. Now all you need to do is add the server and click connect(The lightning button at the top left)

After doing so, type /join #Moparscape and have fun chatting. More commands for you to use will be listed at the end of this topic.

[shadow=orange,left][b]XCHAT[/b][/shadow]

So if you&#39;ve chosen XCHAT to be your client, here is a full tutorial on how to get you familiar with it!

After downloading and installing it, you will come to a screen like this:
[IMG]http://i27.tinypic.com/16or41.jpg[/img]

All you need to do is add your usernames, and add a network. Click Add and add &quot;IRC.Moparisthebest.com&quot; You can favorite channels that you wish to join. In this case, it would be #Moparscape. Click connect and welcome to the Moparscape Channel!

[b][shadow=Purple,left]Browser based forum chat[/shadow]
[/b]

So, not interested in all the hassle of downloading clients? No problem! Here&#39;s the easiest way to get on IRC!

First, scroll up to the top of the site. Click &quot;IRC Chat&quot; as highlighted in the picture below:
[IMG]http://i27.tinypic.com/1y9zqw.jpg[/img]

You will be brought to the Moparisthebest IRC network and should be brought into #Moparscape. Now you are free to chat with other Moparscape users!

[b][shadow=brown,left]Commands, What you can expect, Rules, and Channel OPS[/shadow][/b]


Registering your nickname:
[code]/msg nickserv register YourPassword YourEmail[/code]

Identifying your nickname after registering it:
[code]/msg nickserv identify YourPassword[/code]

Join other channels:
[code]/join #channelName[/code]

Leaving a channel:
[code]/part #ChannelName[/code]


======================= What you can expect==========================
Not all IRC users are friendly. Realize some people are there to help you, while some are there to troll and flame. If you find yourself being flamed or insulted, don&#39;t instigate an argument. Just leave and try again later.

Occasionally you will feel left out, but don&#39;t feel bad. Most of us on IRC have been together for years, so a mutual friendship is shown. Respect must be earned, so it might take sometime to be &quot;accepted&quot;


=======================RULES========================
1) No excess flooding of the channel, please type reasonably and don&#39;t put one word per line. If you &quot;sing&quot; and it disrupts the channel it constitutes as flooding.
2) No excessive trolling, the IRC is a relaxed environment where we can all get along while this isn&#39;t going to be strictly enforced if you become a tall flower (a detrimental issue) then you will be removed from the channel.
3) No advertising - You&#39;re not going to get any traffic here, and people don&#39;t come here to find runescape servers or your new life changing website. Use the appropriate functions to attract appropriate people. For example: If you want to advertise your runescape server use our server status page at http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php
4) Realize that nobody has to help you - We have a server help section and alternate IRC channels like #help if nobody helps you now then try again later or try somewhere else. Do not flood the channel and be a fool.

Any updated rules can be found in the channel topic.

==========Channel OPS============
These are people in charge of maintaining order on the channel. They are represented by colors on XCHAT and a symbol on mIRC.

              <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=36pt]MoparScape IRC![/size]</span></p>
<p>So lets get started… You may be asking yourself, “What is this “IRC” you speak of?” Well let me explain. Basically IRC is a chat where you can chat with many users of the <a href="http://Moparscape.org/smf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org/smf</a> forums, as well as get server help and advice!</p>
<p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, here’s some more info.</p>
<blockquote>Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of real-time Internet chat or synchronous conferencing. It is mainly designed for group (many-to-many) communication in discussion forums called channels, but also allows one-to-one communication via private message and data transfers via Direct Client-to-Client.</blockquote>
<p>So you probably didn’t understand anything mentioned above, but thats okay! IRC is in no way difficult to use!</p>
<p>Lets get started on how to join and start chatting with other forum users! The first part of this will cater to users who already have experience with IRC, but fear not, a newbie tutorial will follow!</p>
<p>[shadow=green,left]<span class="bbcode-b">EXPIRENCED USER TUTORIAL</span>[/shadow]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">IRC Servers as of March 9, 2013:</span><br>
<a href="http://irc.moparisthebest.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.moparisthebest.com</a><br>
irc.moparisthebest.xxx</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Official MoparScape channel:</span><br>
<span class="hashtag">#Moparscape</span></p>
<p>Our IRC network has the same commands as any other network would, so if you use SwiftIRC, Rizon, Freenode, ETC…you’ll be fine with commands.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[shadow=blue,left]NEW USER TUTORIAL[/shadow]</span></p>
<p>So you want to join in on the fun discussion and action that takes part on our IRC. Well first you’ll have to make your big choice of what client you want to use. The two most popular IRC clients are XCHAT and MIRC, or if you don’t wish to download a client you can use the handy IRC Chat option on the Moparscape forums!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mirc.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">mIRC</a>—&gt;FREE<br>
<a href="http://xchat.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">XCHAT</a>—&gt; 30 DAY EVALUATION. If you like XCHAT, then try <a href="http://www.silverex.org/download/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">XCHAT2</a> for free<br>
<a href="https://irc.moparisthebest.xxx:9090/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Browser based chat</a>—&gt;Free &amp; easy…No download required!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[shadow=yellow,left]mIRC[/shadow]</span><br>
So if you’ve chosen mIRC to be your client, here is a full tutorial on how to get you familiar with it!</p>
<p>After downloading and installing it, you will come to a screen like this:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i26.tinypic.com/equlap.jpg" title="equlap.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/equlap.jpg" alt width="690" height="325"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">equlap.jpg</span><span class="informations">784×370</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>At that screen, you should input all the information requested. When putting in your full name and email, you do not need to use your real information. For nickname, chose your chosen nickname, and the alternative is just a back up name in case your name is taken.</p>
<p>Press ok, than close out of that screen. Your should now see your full mIRC client. Now all you need to do is add the server and click connect(The lightning button at the top left)<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i30.tinypic.com/do6z5c.jpg" title="do6z5c.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i30.tinypic.com/do6z5c.jpg" alt width="690" height="322"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">do6z5c.jpg</span><span class="informations">789×369</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>After doing so, type /join <span class="hashtag">#Moparscape</span> and have fun chatting. More commands for you to use will be listed at the end of this topic.</p>
<p>[shadow=orange,left]<span class="bbcode-b">XCHAT</span>[/shadow]</p>
<p>So if you’ve chosen XCHAT to be your client, here is a full tutorial on how to get you familiar with it!</p>
<p>After downloading and installing it, you will come to a screen like this:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i27.tinypic.com/16or41.jpg" title="16or41.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i27.tinypic.com/16or41.jpg" alt width="664" height="500"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>All you need to do is add your usernames, and add a network. Click Add and add “<a href="http://IRC.Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">IRC.Moparisthebest.com</a>” You can favorite channels that you wish to join. In this case, it would be <span class="hashtag">#Moparscape</span>. Click connect and welcome to the Moparscape Channel!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[shadow=Purple,left]Browser based forum chat[/shadow]<br>
</span></p>
<p>So, not interested in all the hassle of downloading clients? No problem! Here’s the easiest way to get on IRC!</p>

<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i27.tinypic.com/1y9zqw.jpg" title="1y9zqw.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i27.tinypic.com/1y9zqw.jpg" alt width="690" height="221"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>You will be brought to the Moparisthebest IRC network and should be brought into <span class="hashtag">#Moparscape</span>. Now you are free to chat with other Moparscape users!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[shadow=brown,left]Commands, What you can expect, Rules, and Channel OPS[/shadow]</span></p>
<p>Registering your nickname:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/msg nickserv register YourPassword YourEmail</code></pre>
<p>Identifying your nickname after registering it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/msg nickserv identify YourPassword</code></pre>
<p>Join other channels:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/join #channelName</code></pre>
<p>Leaving a channel:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/part #ChannelName</code></pre>
<p>======================= What you can expect==========================<br>
Not all IRC users are friendly. Realize some people are there to help you, while some are there to troll and flame. If you find yourself being flamed or insulted, don’t instigate an argument. Just leave and try again later.</p>
<p>Occasionally you will feel left out, but don’t feel bad. Most of us on IRC have been together for years, so a mutual friendship is shown. Respect must be earned, so it might take sometime to be “accepted”</p>
<p>=======================RULES========================</p>
<ol>
<li>No excess flooding of the channel, please type reasonably and don’t put one word per line. If you “sing” and it disrupts the channel it constitutes as flooding.</li>
<li>No excessive trolling, the IRC is a relaxed environment where we can all get along while this isn’t going to be strictly enforced if you become a tall flower (a detrimental issue) then you will be removed from the channel.</li>
<li>No advertising - You’re not going to get any traffic here, and people don’t come here to find runescape servers or your new life changing website. Use the appropriate functions to attract appropriate people. For example: If you want to advertise your runescape server use our server status page at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php</a>
</li>
<li>Realize that nobody has to help you - We have a server help section and alternate IRC channels like <span class="hashtag">#help</span> if nobody helps you now then try again later or try somewhere else. Do not flood the channel and be a fool.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any updated rules can be found in the channel topic.</p>
<p>==========Channel OPS============<br>
These are people in charge of maintaining order on the channel. They are represented by colors on XCHAT and a symbol on mIRC.</p>
