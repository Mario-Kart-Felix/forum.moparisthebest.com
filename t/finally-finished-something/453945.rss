    <description>[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/30u48e0.png[/img]

It took me 7 hours to get this done, but I did it. I know its simple but im not the greatest web devo and the most surprising thing is I didn&#39;t ask for help.. until now XD. Someone wanna make me a better looking banner? I&#39;m the worst when it comes to photoshop.

The server mentioned isn&#39;t advertising seeing how it is in BETA and there arent ANY links and im not trying to advert my site.

*a little update*

<p>Little update; Google is being an asshole and I am having trouble getting with their adsense program because they are stating that my information that I’m giving them references past approved accounts. When I found my old account I tried to cancel and have it transferred to my new one and they arent replying.</p>

<p>You singled out his slogan and told him it’d give him legal issues at a later date. You say you’re trying to help him because he’s new and all you’re doing is putting retarded bullshit in his mind.</p>
<p>Every single company that wants to enter legally bonding issues will warn you before taking action, they will not just simply say they’re suing you and taking all of your money.</p>
<p>What he says on his website is HIS opinion, no website can sue him for having a slogan that attracts users and or states his opinion. The only thing that’ll do if he isn’t the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> hosting company will get him badpress for falsifying information or whatever the fuck it is they do these days.</p>
