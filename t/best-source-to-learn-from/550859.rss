    <title>Best source to learn from?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-source-to-learn-from/550859</link>
    <description>Whats the best source to learn from?  Right now it seems like moparscape or easyrsc would be the best.

What I mean by best is both stable and coded in a well organized way.  

Edit:  https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,667904.0.html they talk about darkquest?  And someone there claims moparscape got dirtied up.</description>

The question was ‘What source can i learn from?’, we have answered that &amp; you have then advised him to start from scratch well no, that’s the wrong way, he wants to look a source &amp; learn how it all works &amp; links together, so how do you expect somebody who doesn’t know the ins and outs of rsc to create his own?..</p>
<p>You at least need to know the structure before you delve.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s incorrect, that’s just like saying you to examine an existing bicycle to build one… when really all you need are instructions. There are plenty of resources out there including what I’ve been mentioning (wiki docs located at the top) to understand how each protocol works. Regardless, it looks as though he has chosen the best route for him, all I offered was advice.</p>

              <p>Yeah see that’s the thing, there is no actual design to any of these servers other than just a barely functional “just works” codebase. In fact, RSCD started off as a hack of sorts by Reines (although i won’t bore you with the details) to reverse engineer the game, which ended up being snowballed into the mess you see today. It doesn’t hurt to experiment and find which approach makes sense to you even if it isn’t the most efficient (since you have some experience with event driven programming, you could apply your experience and build upon it), by getting your hands dirty.</p>
<p>Additionally there’s really no point telling you what bugs/exploits exist because its generally source related (i.e MoparClassic can’t do X, while NoobScape100391x100 can do Y). There’s no right or wrong because no one has actually provided factual evidence to what actually works the best, only theoretical mumbo jumbo. Lothy was probably the closest with the Elysium, yet even that codebase is still quite immature. I suppose if you really do not want to attempt this by yourself or lack the time for it, ask Lothy how you could contribute to his codebase and help develop that into something useful.</p>
<p>PROTIP: Avoid any involvement/advice with Rodgerwilco as he has a history of failure.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

              <p>I think you make a good point.  I feel like I should first get to the point where I understand why the current approach done by everyone using a derivative of the rscd source is sucky though (enlighten me if you have the time).  I see it’s tightly coupled.  I get that that’s dirty.  What else though?</p>
<p>I am graduating in a couple of weeks with a degree in Computer Engineering…  so more lower end stuff than your average CS guy (doing embedded design, hard ware design, etc.).  Although I have worked with event driven servers like Twisted/Nodejs a little.</p>

You’re going about this all wrong, you couldn’t of chosen a worse source to “learn from”. Why not look at RSC docs in the RS Wiki and attempt to build your own. It’s nothing more than a basic client/server model using a custom protocol. Use design patterns where necessary and try to modularize components of your project to keep SoC. Follow up with best practices and patch essential security problems (never trusting the client) followed up with writing unit tests to ensure QA and you’ll produce something this forum hasn’t been able to do for years.</p>
<p>inb4 easier said than done. If you really give a flying fudge about producing a quality private server, then you won’t rely on existing community resources that are obsolete and rely on poorly written coupled code.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I would prefer to go that route.  That’s essentially what Esylium is for Lothy isn’t it?  However I feel the learning curve would be a bit too much for me.  I’d loose motivation.  So instead I’m thinking I’ll stick with working on the best sucky source out there, and then once I have my head wrapped around how it works I’ll either refactor it all or just scrap it and restart.[/quote]</p>
<p>That makes no sense. What you’re essentially saying is: I’ll waste time looking at what I shouldn’t do, then choose to fix it or go back to the beginning just to do it all over again when I could of done that from the start. The key issue I always see here is people always want/need instant gratification without actually learning anything, and I guarantee you won’t learn a thing by working on “sucky sources”. I think I read somewhere you’ve studied CS or some related discipline? Take this as a learning experience, start by laying the ground work by listing requirements and creating a game plan. Hell, you could learn a lot just by setting up your environment if you’re brand new and effectively create an efficient workflow to save you time in the future. Work your way up by splitting the project into individual problems then design elegant solutions to solving said issues. Rinse and repeat; it may take time, but its well worth it and best of all you wouldn’t be stuck in a worthless feedback loop.</p>
<p>Edit: Ugh i’m not even sure why I’m bothering, just my 2c</p>

              <p>Okay so I’ve been diving into EasyRsc.  Just a few questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If I wanted to use a database to save/load player data, would I want to keep the player data in memory and save every X minutes like how easyrsc is setup right now?  Or should I have it save things whenever they’re changed?  That would result in a ton of reads/writes… would that be a significant amount to reduce performance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whats the purpose in having seperate login/game servers?  EasyRSC doesn’t have that (so far as I can tell), but MoparClassic does.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So far I’ve… fixed the mining so higher level picks mine multiple times :D.</p>

<p>Runescape classic was written in java with a custom scripting language called runescript for object actions, quests, and general game content. I just recently learned that Rab, the first player to register for runescape who also was the first moderator was given runescript to develop Romeo &amp; Juliet with a few other quests and a lot of runescape 2 misc.

<p>Thank you for correcting me, I had some in-cling as to how it began wasn’t 100% sure, the idea of the community creating the quests in some aspects is not a bad idea, it should be then down to jagex themselves to then agree on the rewards.</p>
<p>Just like most auto-bots, STS, autorune etc create a program and let the users create most of there own scripts. Shame they still have RSC closed down, I would create another account in an instant, I did last time they opened forgot my details though.</p>

              <p>I’m not looking to learn how to program.  I know how to program well enough.  Experienced can mean different things.  I’m graduating in a few days with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering.  I’ve had several internships where I’ve worked with python, javascript, java, c#, c++, and c.  Some would consider that experienced.  Others wouldn’t.  I like to think my toes are wet and I understand what it takes to jump in.  I’m looking for something to work on in spare time.  Something that is structurally set up in a decent way because I don’t have experience with game servers to know how to design them well.  I could work on moparscape, but I would end up being one of those guys who commits code that really doesn’t fit quite right.  I like the idea of Elysium because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It seems like Lothy is a decent programmer with more experience than me.</li>
<li>Lothy won’t simply allow me to commit things if I do ever make changes.  He’ll review what I’ve done, and give feedback (I hope).  From that I’d be able to learn from him whether he realizes it or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>What I don’t like about Elysium is:</p>
<ol>
<li>It might still need a lot of design work done, and since Lothy is somewhat mia that would be left to me.  And I have little experience with designing a game server.</li>
<li>It’s going to be harder to get going than simply using RSCD based source.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll tinker around with it.  If things seem within my grasp I’ll try helping out.</p>

I’d really say you learn from both, and know many people who started out tinkering around with others’ code, as long as he has access to Google it seems plausible this was his goal.  It seems like if he wanted what was easiest to run, he would have asked for it, but maybe I am being a bit naive there.</p>
