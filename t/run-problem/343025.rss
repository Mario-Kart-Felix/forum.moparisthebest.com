    <description>Ok, i just started my server 2 days ago, it was running fine and people we logging on, i had about 12 players online on average and today while i was out, i guess my ports shut off or something and now when i run it doesnt work, it says error connecting to server. i never turned it off but when i got back to my server i had people saying it was offline and my run.bat cmd prompt was still running and everything. if anyone can help me you can have hidden admin and rep++
