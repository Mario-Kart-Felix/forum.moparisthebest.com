    <title>Most Stable Source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/most-stable-source/435620</link>
    <description>Hi, was wondering what the most stable source around is to build on with no/not a lot of customisation and where could I download it from.

Much appreciated :D</description>

Most stable source means nothing around here, as the most stable ones are the most basic ones, with no content. content can create instability.</p>
<p>Lets get real:</p>
<p>RSCD &gt; RSCD v25 &gt;<br>
RSCAngel &gt;<br>
MoparClassic<br>
DarkQuest<br>
RSCEmulation</p>
<pre><code>       google.com
</code></pre>
<p>MoonSpell<br>
RSCDEF<br>
Catalyst<br>
RSCD? (Kryptix version)<br>
&lt;insert frameworks that may be better than original RSCD, but have little to no content here&gt;</p>
<p>this is a basic hierarchy.</p>
<p><a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> was the only one to provide content and get past the ‘framework’ stage of an RSC server emu. it was also based off the original RSCD. The other 3 most popular servers around were all based off RSCD v25 (due to the large amount of content it featured) and then RSCAngel that improved on that, then MoparClassic that improved on that…</p>
<p>DarkQuest contains custom content that you would have to remove, RSCEmulation is not open source.</p>
<p>Your left with MoparClassic, which you could spend a couple of days making the framework a little more like the others, or spend months adding the content into those other frameworks.</p>
<p><a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> may arguably have slightly better performance than RSCD v25, however it only has the content setup for a PK server.</p>
<p>If you use any other server, you need to spend months on content, you need to find hundreds of players to properly bug report &amp; stability testing, your bound to come across dupes that may ruin your server, most of all you’ll need to be dedicated throughout all this to continue it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I really don’t see how you can say RSCDEF or RSCAngel is better than Mopar Classic.  I’d love to see the rationale behind it, especially seeing content wise Mopar Classic is right where Angel was, but has had a shitload of improvements in the code itself.[/quote]</p>
<p>i didn’t say RSCDEF/RSCAngel is better than MoparClassic, lol why would i say that. if i did, i didn’t mean to.</p>

              <p>Ridiculous lol.</p>
<p>Why is this topic continually discussed? No one here has the most “stable” or “close to stable” source, nor will they ever if they continually add new content and don’t have the numbers to scale the length of the problem. How about instead of saying “this source is better than this because of blahblahblabhalbha” show some benchmarks and prove your point. If you complain you don’t have enough players and that it wouldn’t be accurate, you can always gather estimates using bots.</p>

I’ve always been wondering where do you guys get so much negative energy to argue here in every post you write?<br>
It’s silly and makes you all look like complete idiots, stop wasting your time and focus on something that matters.</p>

You’ve succeeded, but however, this will be the last time regardless if you try again.</p>

<p>I don’t take into account you claiming you’re leaving at all, I generally ignore it, unless you come back afterwards (which you do at least once in every single argument).  So, your theory is completely wrong.</p>

That point is irrelevant, because he at least knows things are bad.  If he knows why is irrelevant, because he’s made a valid point, and you’re trying to counter it by saying he doesn’t know why it is.  That does not counter the completely valid, and correct point.[/quote]</p>
<p>It is the point. It’s the point of me coming in here and directing my questions at him. It’s the reason for everything. If you cannot see that then you’re completely retarded (and I don’t mean retarded as in ‘oh he said something stupid’, I mean literally ‘you put your hand up to your chest and yell out random shit’ retarded).</p>
<p>What ‘points’ has he made, other than the correct answer? I asked why it was the correct answer, there was no ‘countering’ done here. You’re an idiot…[/quote]<br>
Learn how to read.  Actually, let me bold this for you:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">That point is irrelevant</span></p>
<p>Now, where did I claim it wasn’t a point in what you quoted?  Oh wait, I didn’t.  You simply can not read.</p>
<p>Also, you’ve gone in a circle now.  I have said multiple times now, that undermining his reason for saying something does not make the statement invalid.  This is very well established logic, and you can’t quite seem to understand this very fundamental part of logic.</p>
<p>You’ve also never even attempted to refute my argument for it being irrelevant, and you’ve just claimed the same thing again.  This is exactly what I was talking about before.</p>

<p>He stopped replying and started agreeing with anything you said, purely because you’re on his side. You’re fighting it for him if you think so or not.

You’ve contradicted yourself in the very same sentence…[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, it would appear that way… <span class="bbcode-i">To people who have a hard time understanding</span>. If he doesn’t understand/know about the subject at hand, he can’t form an opinion of his own. He’d have to turn to someone, and use their logic/opinion/whatever and he goes with that.[/quote]<br>
But there are multiple opinions on these subjects, and he needs to find a reason to pick one.  And most of the time it happens to be the correct choice.  I’d say that he’s taking these opinions, and evaluating them in such a way that he actually learns enough to tell which one is correct.</p>
<p>Oh wait, but that means he needs to have some understanding of the subject at hand to choose the correct opinion.  Man, that completely contradicts your entire theory.</p>

That is just how you work; you come up with some stupid idea, and try to argue it no matter how many times it’s refuted.  Eventually a mod steps in, or the person you’re arguing with gets tired of your constant illogical arguments.</p>

</aside>
<p>I can see by the first sentence (the only sentence I read of this quote) that you’ve tried to twist it in your head and made it about me.  We both know it’s completely wrong (which is why I didn’t bother).[/quote]<br>
It was so wrong, that you just happened to do exactly what I said you would.  Jeez, I muse be losing my edge.  Can you teach me?  Oh ya, I forgot, you’re the one that has no idea how to use logic, or progress in an argument, because you can only go in circles.</p>
<p>[quote=“Outspoken, post:8, topic:435630”]There you go. Now I feel bad because I went against what I said I wouldn’t do. I’ve been trolled into replying :(. Say whatever you want, reply as many times as you want (you will, we both know you can’t control yourself) after I leave, <span class="bbcode-i">it wont matter</span>. At the end of the day, it doesn’t make my reasons invalid, it doesn’t make him less annoying, and it doesn’t make you less of an idiot.</p>
<p>(Y).[/quote]<br>
You must feel very, very bad, as you go against what you say every single time we argue.</p>
<p>Also, I gladly reply, because you and I both know you will read it.  Claiming you will not post again does not mean you win, it just means you’ve quit.  BTW I find it funny how you quit every time you get completely trashed, and then explicitly say you’re not going to reply in hopes that I will back down; you must be pretty stupid to not understand that I do not back down…</p>

<p>That’s not the point. He doesn’t know why it’s bad and he speaks as if he does. <span class="bbcode-i">That</span> is annoying.[/quote]<br>
That point is irrelevant, because he at least knows things are bad.  If he knows why is irrelevant, because he’s made a valid point, and you’re trying to counter it by saying he doesn’t know why it is.  That does not counter the completely valid, and correct point.</p>

3 &amp; 4 are different, as some people just don’t like sharing their work with others.  While he could be willing to share his work with others, just not you.</p>
<p>5 &amp; 2 are different as well.  5 is prevention you from being annoying, while 2 lack of confidence.[/quote]</p>
<p>Considering I’ve (or anyone else that I know) never seen his RSCDef ‘project’ (or heard of it), and no one he associates himself with never mentioned it (here, IRC or otherwise), I think it’s safe for me to say 3 &amp; 4 are the same. Feel free to prove me wrong.</p>
<p>5 &amp; 2 could be looked at either way. However, because of him not being able to explain “well known facts”, I leaned towards them being the same.[/quote]<br>

Anyone with any understanding of logic or common sense would see how your arguments are completely illogical and flawed.  But you’re bombarding Rodgerwilco with an onslaught of retarded questions, and it doesn’t really give him a chance to point out these obvious flaws.  The tactic you use is constantly used by reporters when they try to make people look stupid; sure it’s annoying and childish, but it’s not a valid way to prove it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s really just an opinion. One of which you can already guess doesn’t matter to me. Do go on though.[/quote]<br>
It’s not an opinion, it’s an obvious fact.  You clearly have no understanding of formal logic, otherwise you wouldn’t think it was an opinion.</p>

<p>[quote=“Outspoken, post:7, topic:435630”]Edit- I think you 2 understand by now, so this will probably end up going in circles to see who can last longer (like ever other argument on Mopar).

You’re now trying to win the argument by continually asking him to prove/explain things that are very well know facts.  This not a valid way to prove someone is incompetent, because they will eventually say ‘fuck off’ and look it up, as you’re being a complete moron.</p>
<p>He also has 3, 4, or 5…<br>
3) He just doesn’t want to share his work.<br>
4) He doesn’t want to give you his work because he doesn’t like you.<br>
5) He knows you’re going to examine it with a fine toothed comb to try and make him look bad, no matter what.</p>
<p>Note: These are not the only other options, just some very likely ones.<br>

<p>There is no ‘argument’, I’m merely asking questions. Also if he can’t explain these well known facts, I wont be the one that looks like a moron, he will. I’ll just look like an ass for dragging it along.</p>
<p>3 &amp; 4 are essentially the same thing. 5 &amp; 2 are the same thing.[/quote]<br>
3 &amp; 4 are different, as some people just don’t like sharing their work with others.  While he could be willing to share his work with others, just not you.</p>
<p>5 &amp; 2 are different as well.  5 is prevention you from being annoying, while 2 lack of confidence.</p>
<p>[quote=“Outspoken, post:5, topic:435630”]<a class="mention" href="/u/rodgerwilco">@Rodgerwilco</a>: Feel safe now that someone came to your rescue?[/quote]Implying he needed someone to step in…  Anyone with any understanding of logic or common sense would see how your arguments are completely illogical and flawed.  But you’re bombarding Rodgerwilco with an onslaught of retarded questions, and it doesn’t really give him a chance to point out these obvious flaws.  The tactic you use is constantly used by reporters when they try to make people look stupid; sure it’s annoying and childish, but it’s not a valid way to prove it.</p>

<p>Can’t really debate it because nobody ever took RSCDEF and completed it. There are a lot of issues with the source that would notice if you actually developed with it. A lot of the features you listed were never finished, RSCDEF was just an experiment to do something different and object was one of the first people to implement an area system and explore that route.</p>
<p>You can take moparclassic and with a little bit of work make it event driver using mina.</p>

</aside>
<p>As far as <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> know, no one has ever completed it. Also why do you, every chance you get, jump at the sight of ‘RSCDEF’ when you know absolutely nothing about the source? The only thing I’ve seen you speak about is the ‘thread-per-client’, and you always say the same thing each time, which just so happens to be what xEnt said about it.</p>
<p>Please speak more about the source. I’d love to hear your (original) thoughts…</p>

</aside>
<p>I am the only person (that I know of) that actually picked up the source and did something with it. So yes I know the pros and cons of the source. Talking about it and actually doing something with it are two completely different things, so keep talking. thread-per-client approach is obvious and always has been obvious;therefore, I didn’t bother mentioning it. Lol @ your ent comment.</p>

<p>Once again, RSCDEF was entirely an experiment and proof of concept. More importantly, we should be addressing his latest project, not this bs.</p>

<p>Oh? you fixed up the source? Lets see what you’ve done with it (<em>cough</em> inb4 some excuse <em>cough</em>).</p>

<p>You’re an idiot…</p>
<p>You’ve always said thread-per-client was bad. You’ve never gave your opinion as to why, which makes everyone (not just me, but quite a few people) think you’re blowing smoke and just repeating what others have said.[/quote]Why would anyone explain something so obvious?</p>
<p>Also, who cares if he’s repeating what others have said?  That doesn’t make it any less valid.</p>

<p>I’ve already called you an idiot, so I’m just going to move on.</p>

<p>Well lets see, you’ve brought up that you’ve done something with it, and I asked to see it… There’s only 1 of 2 reasons why you would mention you’ve worked on the source but wont show anyone;</p>
<ol>
<li>You haven’t.</li>
<li>You’re insecure about your own code/It’s not properly done.</li>

<p>“Different containers for different areas, instead of just one container (World.java)”<br>
Not hard to implement/switch.</p>
<p>“None of the memory leaks where objects are not removed when they are no longer needed”<br>
This is covered by the idea of areas.</p>
<p>“Script system better than any public RSCD script implementation”<br>
It looks just like RSCD’s idea of events, but re-factored a bit.</p>
<p>“Extensive documentation”<br>
Agreed.</p>
<p>“Lower latency and response time, actions are processed almost instantly”<br>
Very easy to change RSCD to do this.</p>
<p>Note, when I say RSCD I am talking about the current Mopar Classic source.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s fair, I can’t say that I’ve really taken a look at Mopar Classic. From what I’ve heard you have really been making some progress with improving RSCD, which is good. I would personally rather work on advancing RSCDEF than spend time porting its features and improving RSCD.</p>
