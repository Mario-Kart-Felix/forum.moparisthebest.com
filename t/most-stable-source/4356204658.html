Which is exactly my point‚Ä¶  You‚Äôre just being annoying for absolutely no reason, as proving that he doesn‚Äôt know <span class="bbcode-i">why</span> something is bad doesn‚Äôt prove that it‚Äôs not bad.[/quote]</p>
<p>That‚Äôs not the point. He doesn‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs bad and he speaks as if he does. <span class="bbcode-i">That</span> is annoying.[/quote]<br>
That point is irrelevant, because he at least knows things are bad.  If he knows why is irrelevant, because he‚Äôs made a valid point, and you‚Äôre trying to counter it by saying he doesn‚Äôt know why it is.  That does not counter the completely valid, and correct point.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúOutspoken, post:7, topic:435630‚Äù][quote author=CodeForFame link=topic=538342.msg3939615#msg3939615 date=1331315122]<br>
Okay, so three people.  That is not quite a few, even in this small community.[/quote]</p>
<p>What?[/quote]<br>
Apparently you forgot what you were responding to.  Man, you‚Äôre more idiotic than I thought.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúOutspoken, post:7, topic:435630‚Äù][quote author=CodeForFame link=topic=538342.msg3939615#msg3939615 date=1331315122]<br>
3 &amp; 4 are different, as some people just don‚Äôt like sharing their work with others.  While he could be willing to share his work with others, just not you.</p>
<p>5 &amp; 2 are different as well.  5 is prevention you from being annoying, while 2 lack of confidence.[/quote]</p>
<p>Considering I‚Äôve (or anyone else that I know) never seen his RSCDef ‚Äòproject‚Äô (or heard of it), and no one he associates himself with never mentioned it (here, IRC or otherwise), I think it‚Äôs safe for me to say 3 &amp; 4 are the same. Feel free to prove me wrong.</p>
<p>5 &amp; 2 could be looked at either way. However, because of him not being able to explain ‚Äúwell known facts‚Äù, I leaned towards them being the same.[/quote]<br>
Even if the project doesn‚Äôt exist, that doesn‚Äôt make 3 &amp; 4 the same.  The existence of the project has nothing to do with the differences between the two.  You really need to learn how to think‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Uhh‚Ä¶ Yeah?</p>
<p>You stepped in for him didn‚Äôt you? Clearly you saw he needed some type of help.[/quote]<br>
I didn‚Äôt step in <span class="bbcode-b">for</span> him.  I stepped in because you were bombarding him with completely idiotic posts, that were just going to waste everyone‚Äôs time.</p>

Anyone with any understanding of logic or common sense would see how your arguments are completely illogical and flawed.  But you‚Äôre bombarding Rodgerwilco with an onslaught of retarded questions, and it doesn‚Äôt really give him a chance to point out these obvious flaws.  The tactic you use is constantly used by reporters when they try to make people look stupid; sure it‚Äôs annoying and childish, but it‚Äôs not a valid way to prove it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That‚Äôs really just an opinion. One of which you can already guess doesn‚Äôt matter to me. Do go on though.[/quote]<br>
It‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs an obvious fact.  You clearly have no understanding of formal logic, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt think it was an opinion.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúOutspoken, post:7, topic:435630‚Äù][quote author=Rodgerwilco link=topic=538342.msg3939622#msg3939622 date=1331315839]<br>
I will go with <span class="hashtag">#4</span> and <span class="hashtag">#5</span>. One of the projects you ‚Äúlisted‚Äù was probably me under a different alias <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> and if you want to mention those people with pompano crew trying to do something with it, I lol.

<p>Of course you will go with <span class="hashtag">#4</span> and <span class="hashtag">#5</span>, because that‚Äôs just what you do. <span class="bbcode-b">You don‚Äôt have an opinion of your own</span>, <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> go by what others say and <span class="bbcode-b">pick the best option</span>.[/quote]<br>
You‚Äôve contradicted yourself in the very same sentence‚Ä¶</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúOutspoken, post:7, topic:435630‚Äù]Edit- I think you 2 understand by now, so this will probably end up going in circles to see who can last longer (like ever other argument on Mopar). I guess this is probably where I need to jump off and go back to what I was doing. Happy replying back after I‚Äôve already left the thread alone :)[/quote]Yes, because you will continually make the argument circular seeing you have nothing new to bring to the discussion.  That is just how you work; you come up with some stupid idea, and try to argue it no matter how many times it‚Äôs refuted.  Eventually a mod steps in, or the person you‚Äôre arguing with gets tired of your constant illogical arguments.</p>

<p>Ah ok, you win. I usually don‚Äôt post back after I said I‚Äôm leaving, but you‚Äôve attacked me with this completely (probably intentional, else‚Ä¶ Wow‚Ä¶) retarded post in hopes for me to come back (don‚Äôt argue that you didn‚Äôt, otherwise you would have left it alone like any normal person would). You‚Äôve succeeded, but however, this will be the last time regardless if you try again.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don‚Äôt take into account you claiming you‚Äôre leaving at all, I generally ignore it, unless you come back afterwards (which you do at least once in every single argument).  So, your theory is completely wrong.</p>

That point is irrelevant, because he at least knows things are bad.  If he knows why is irrelevant, because he‚Äôs made a valid point, and you‚Äôre trying to counter it by saying he doesn‚Äôt know why it is.  That does not counter the completely valid, and correct point.[/quote]</p>
<p>It is the point. It‚Äôs the point of me coming in here and directing my questions at him. It‚Äôs the reason for everything. If you cannot see that then you‚Äôre completely retarded (and I don‚Äôt mean retarded as in ‚Äòoh he said something stupid‚Äô, I mean literally ‚Äòyou put your hand up to your chest and yell out random shit‚Äô retarded).</p>
<p>What ‚Äòpoints‚Äô has he made, other than the correct answer? I asked why it was the correct answer, there was no ‚Äòcountering‚Äô done here. You‚Äôre an idiot‚Ä¶[/quote]<br>
Learn how to read.  Actually, let me bold this for you:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">That point is irrelevant</span></p>
<p>Now, where did I claim it wasn‚Äôt a point in what you quoted?  Oh wait, I didn‚Äôt.  You simply can not read.</p>
<p>Also, you‚Äôve gone in a circle now.  I have said multiple times now, that undermining his reason for saying something does not make the statement invalid.  This is very well established logic, and you can‚Äôt quite seem to understand this very fundamental part of logic.</p>
<p>You‚Äôve also never even attempted to refute my argument for it being irrelevant, and you‚Äôve just claimed the same thing again.  This is exactly what I was talking about before.</p>

Also, I wasn‚Äôt wasting ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs‚Äù time, I was wasting <span class="bbcode-b">his</span> time.[/quote]I didn‚Äôt pick sides for any reason other than your argument was completely ridiculous, and you were using underhanded tactics in order to annoy him.  If he were doing it to you, I would have sided with you.</p>

It‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs an obvious fact.  You clearly have no understanding of formal logic, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt think it was an opinion.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just because you think it‚Äôs a fact doesn‚Äôt mean it is.[/quote]<br>
Please learn how to read.  I am not claiming my opinion makes it fact, I am claiming that it is fact due to the logic, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

You‚Äôve contradicted yourself in the very same sentence‚Ä¶[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, it would appear that way‚Ä¶ <span class="bbcode-i">To people who have a hard time understanding</span>. If he doesn‚Äôt understand/know about the subject at hand, he can‚Äôt form an opinion of his own. He‚Äôd have to turn to someone, and use their logic/opinion/whatever and he goes with that.[/quote]<br>
But there are multiple opinions on these subjects, and he needs to find a reason to pick one.  And most of the time it happens to be the correct choice.  I‚Äôd say that he‚Äôs taking these opinions, and evaluating them in such a way that he actually learns enough to tell which one is correct.</p>
<p>Oh wait, but that means he needs to have some understanding of the subject at hand to choose the correct opinion.  Man, that completely contradicts your entire theory.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúOutspoken, post:8, topic:435630‚Äù][quote author=CodeForFame link=topic=538342.msg3939723#msg3939723 date=1331325205]Yes, because you will continually make the argument circular seeing you have nothing new to bring to the discussion.  That is just how you work; you come up with some stupid idea, and try to argue it no matter how many times it‚Äôs refuted.  Eventually a mod steps in, or the person you‚Äôre arguing with gets tired of your constant illogical arguments.</p>

<p>I can see by the first sentence (the only sentence I read of this quote) that you‚Äôve tried to twist it in your head and made it about me.  We both know it‚Äôs completely wrong (which is why I didn‚Äôt bother).[/quote]<br>
It was so wrong, that you just happened to do exactly what I said you would.  Jeez, I muse be losing my edge.  Can you teach me?  Oh ya, I forgot, you‚Äôre the one that has no idea how to use logic, or progress in an argument, because you can only go in circles.</p>
<p>[quote=‚ÄúOutspoken, post:8, topic:435630‚Äù]There you go. Now I feel bad because I went against what I said I wouldn‚Äôt do. I‚Äôve been trolled into replying :(. Say whatever you want, reply as many times as you want (you will, we both know you can‚Äôt control yourself) after I leave, <span class="bbcode-i">it wont matter</span>. At the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt make my reasons invalid, it doesn‚Äôt make him less annoying, and it doesn‚Äôt make you less of an idiot.</p>
<p>(Y).[/quote]<br>
You must feel very, very bad, as you go against what you say every single time we argue.</p>
<p>Also, I gladly reply, because you and I both know you will read it.  Claiming you will not post again does not mean you win, it just means you‚Äôve quit.  BTW I find it funny how you quit every time you get completely trashed, and then explicitly say you‚Äôre not going to reply in hopes that I will back down; you must be pretty stupid to not understand that I do not back down‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>Most stable source means nothing around here, as the most stable ones are the most basic ones, with no content. content can create instability.</p>
<p>Lets get real:</p>
<p>RSCD &gt; RSCD v25 &gt;<br>
RSCAngel &gt;<br>
MoparClassic<br>
DarkQuest<br>
RSCEmulation</p>
<pre><code>       StorkPK

RSCD? (Kryptix version)<br>
&lt;insert frameworks that may be better than original RSCD, but have little to no content here&gt;</p>
<p>this is a basic hierarchy.</p>
<p>StorkPK was the only one to provide content and get past the ‚Äòframework‚Äô stage of an RSC server emu. it was also based off the original RSCD. The other 3 most popular servers around were all based off RSCD v25 (due to the large amount of content it featured) and then RSCAngel that improved on that, then MoparClassic that improved on that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>DarkQuest contains custom content that you would have to remove, RSCEmulation is not open source.</p>
<p>Your left with MoparClassic, which you could spend a couple of days making the framework a little more like the others, or spend months adding the content into those other frameworks.</p>
<p>StorkPK may arguably have slightly better performance than RSCD v25, however it only has the content setup for a PK server.</p>
<p>If you use any other server, you need to spend months on content, you need to find hundreds of players to properly bug report &amp; stability testing, your bound to come across dupes that may ruin your server, most of all you‚Äôll need to be dedicated throughout all this to continue it.</p>

I really don‚Äôt see how you can say RSCDEF or RSCAngel is better than Mopar Classic.  I‚Äôd love to see the rationale behind it, especially seeing content wise Mopar Classic is right where Angel was, but has had a shitload of improvements in the code itself.</p>

        <p>Ridiculous lol.</p>
<p>Why is this topic continually discussed? No one here has the most ‚Äústable‚Äù or ‚Äúclose to stable‚Äù source, nor will they ever if they continually add new content and don‚Äôt have the numbers to scale the length of the problem. How about instead of saying ‚Äúthis source is better than this because of blahblahblabhalbha‚Äù show some benchmarks and prove your point. If you complain you don‚Äôt have enough players and that it wouldn‚Äôt be accurate, you can always gather estimates using bots.</p>

Most stable source means nothing around here, as the most stable ones are the most basic ones, with no content. content can create instability.</p>
<p>Lets get real:</p>
<p>RSCD &gt; RSCD v25 &gt;<br>
RSCAngel &gt;<br>
MoparClassic<br>
DarkQuest<br>
RSCEmulation</p>
<pre><code>       google.com
</code></pre>
<p>MoonSpell<br>
RSCDEF<br>
Catalyst<br>
RSCD? (Kryptix version)<br>
&lt;insert frameworks that may be better than original RSCD, but have little to no content here&gt;</p>
<p>this is a basic hierarchy.</p>
<p><a href="http://google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> was the only one to provide content and get past the ‚Äòframework‚Äô stage of an RSC server emu. it was also based off the original RSCD. The other 3 most popular servers around were all based off RSCD v25 (due to the large amount of content it featured) and then RSCAngel that improved on that, then MoparClassic that improved on that‚Ä¶</p>
<p>DarkQuest contains custom content that you would have to remove, RSCEmulation is not open source.</p>
<p>Your left with MoparClassic, which you could spend a couple of days making the framework a little more like the others, or spend months adding the content into those other frameworks.</p>
<p><a href="http://google.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">google.com</a> may arguably have slightly better performance than RSCD v25, however it only has the content setup for a PK server.</p>
<p>If you use any other server, you need to spend months on content, you need to find hundreds of players to properly bug report &amp; stability testing, your bound to come across dupes that may ruin your server, most of all you‚Äôll need to be dedicated throughout all this to continue it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I really don‚Äôt see how you can say RSCDEF or RSCAngel is better than Mopar Classic.  I‚Äôd love to see the rationale behind it, especially seeing content wise Mopar Classic is right where Angel was, but has had a shitload of improvements in the code itself.[/quote]</p>
<p>i didn‚Äôt say RSCDEF/RSCAngel is better than MoparClassic, lol why would i say that. if i did, i didn‚Äôt mean to.</p>
