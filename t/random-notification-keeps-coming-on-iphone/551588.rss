    <title>Random notification keeps coming on iPhone!</title>

    <description>[s]Hi, 

I keep getting a random notification on my iPhone. It seems as if somebody is able to send me notifications somehow. I haven&#39;t got any weird apps installed and nobody had access to my phone. 

Here&#39;s one of the notifications I got and this is what it looked like:

The notification itself looks weird. Any ideas how this is done? I have a feeling of my friends is pulling a prank on me but it&#39;s really weird. 

Help would be appreciated!

Edit: I forgot to mention, when that screen appears I can&#39;t use the home button to dismiss. I have to press the dismiss button. I have assistive touch turned on and I can&#39;t even double click home to view open apps or even open up notification centre etc. it&#39;s really weird and I need help![/s]

Found out how it was done. There&#39;s an app in the app store that allows you to do this.</description>
