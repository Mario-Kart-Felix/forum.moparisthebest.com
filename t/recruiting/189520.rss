    <description>I just bought a new domain and I have been looking for some people to join and start a community. I have about 30 registered users in 3-4 days so far... Im hoping to get 100-ish soon! The forums are mainly for graphic design and 317 cache/RSPS programming. The reason I posted is because the official server for the site is coming along but we need 2-3 client developers. Its going to be big... Dont post on here unless you want to join... 
the official site is www.dhareauxk.com - check it out and tell us if you want to develop the client(s) with us :D</description>
