    <title>How to make spells? [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-spells-pi/518390</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently trying to add Storm of armadyl and i&#39;m trying to make it use the arma runes, that the staff would make the spell more Op&#39;ed and faster and to make the replacement spell have it&#39;s logo(icon). If anyone knows how to make it without replacing a spell please tell me!
All responses and explanations are greatly appreciated. If you got a tut, snip or you can even spoonfeed me that&#39;s even better!
Thank you :)</description>
