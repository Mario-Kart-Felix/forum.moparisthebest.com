    <description>I am trying to Learn so please only post HELPFUL comments.
Could someone explain this to me, SLOWLY.
[code]		case 13355:
		itemDef.modelid = 62693;
		itemDef.name = &quot;Pernix cowl&quot;;
		itemDef.description = &quot;Pernix cowl&quot;;

Take me step by step what does each part mean?
Please and thank you.</description>

<p>-modelID determines what the item looks like when dropped on the ground and the basis for it’s appearance in your inventory.</p>
<p>-name is the item’s name</p>
<p>-description is the item’s examine info, but for some sources it won’t really matter since examine info is based off your item.cfg or whatever.</p>
<p>-modelZoom is how much the inventory icon is zoomed in. If the zoom is too low, then the item might appear like a grain of rice, or if it’s too high, the item will be cut off by its boundaries and it’ll look really bad on your resume</p>
<p>-modelRotationY is how much the inventory model is rotated along the Y axis. It can be negative<br>
-you can probably guess what rotationX does</p>
<p>offset is used to move stuff up or down, left or right - you can probably tell which each does</p>
<p>-anInt165 is how the item appears when worn by a male character<br>
-anInt200 is for female</p>
<p>-groundActions is how you can interact when the item when it’s dropped on the ground, e.g. taking items or lighting logs on fire. not sure if adding the take option is a billion percent necessary</p>
<p>-itemActions is how you interact when the item is in your inventory and makes it recognize options etc etc.</p>
<p>-the int next to the itemActions in brackets is where each of the actions is placed. Since “Wear” is first, the left click option will be to wear it. check charges is second, so when you right click it it’ll be below Wear</p>
<p>-Not sure if adding the drop action is necessary, you can go try if you want to save some potential space</p>
<p>-anInt175 I think is the model that a male character uses when in dialogue with NPCS, aka chathead<br>
-anInt197 is female</p>
<p>-break; ends the switch case</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s some more itemDef related components than just these, try to figure out how to implement them:<br>
-Original and modified colors (recoloring, in case you want to do something like make a set of torva that looks like this <a href="http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_warrior" rel="nofollow noopener">http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Ancient_warrior</a><br>
-Adding another model to your item, needed for like platebodies and stuff<br>
-Adding three models if you want to add stuff like saradomin plates<br>
-stackable boolean<br>
-Cache packing (not a billion percent sure if cache packing has less lag than itemDef, but it probably does)<br>
-Adding your own custom models</p>
<p>Good luck![/quote][/code] Dude thank you SO much, if I could Rep++.</p>
