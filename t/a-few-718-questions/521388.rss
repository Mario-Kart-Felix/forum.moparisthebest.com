    <title>A few 718 questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-718-questions/521388</link>
    <description>So I want to make a RSPS for me and my friends to screw around on, but I&#39;ve come across some problems. Please don&#39;t hate, I&#39;m new to this :s
(I&#39;ve googled a lot of this and still haven&#39;t come across the answer to all this, so please help me :/)
First: It never connects even after I&#39;ve changed &quot;public static final String IP&quot; I&#39;ve changed it from 127.0.0.1 to my No-IP.org. (for other people )
Second: The cache doesn&#39;t seem to load, how do I change where the cache loads from on 718? All I&#39;ve seen is change it in Signlink.java, but I don&#39;t have that file.
Third: How do I change the SUB_REVISION in the server? I&#39;ve read that it might be causing a problem for people connecting. For the life of me I can&#39;t find it.
Like I said, I&#39;ve tried googling my questions but have had no progress &gt;.&gt; and please don&#39;t say something like &#39; well if you were good you&#39;d know &#39; or something because all I&#39;m doing is trying to learn about RSPS then eventually start coding some stuff.
Thanks.</description>

I actually have. I’ve come across some fixes, but they didn’t work. But thanks anyway… I guess.</p>
