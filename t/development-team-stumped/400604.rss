    <description>Hello moparscape,
I am with microFire development- The future of online gaming, and currently i am stumped,
I have made many webclients before with no problem but do not know what the problem is now,
I have my jar maker, and i select the output directory (where the jar will go to)
and the input directory (folder with applet_sub1.java and client.java) the only two files you need for
a webclient, now it jars and everything but when i double click it the loading circle will appear by my mouse,
but after that nothing happens, the jar doesn&#39;t execute, open, or even give me an error! I have tried many 
different aspects of the maker, and many method&#39;s, and still, nothing if anyone can help that would be great :)

Regards,
