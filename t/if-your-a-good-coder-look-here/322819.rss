    <title>If your a good coder look here!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-your-a-good-coder-look-here/322819</link>
    <description>Ok I need Several things and due to the amount of help i have received previously on this forum i doubt any1 will help i need:

A direct Code for ::noclip that doesnt ban normal players or any of that shit, just kicks them if they are below integer i allow probably &gt;= 3

A Direct Code for a xplock command dont tell me go into files and declare shit etc u gotta give me exact command and tell me exactly what to do, this area of coding isnt my expertise. Sorta need a spoonfeed there.

Some advice on how to edit items that are obtainable in shops,

And finally but least important how to permanantly keep a npc in a location, i use ::npc (id) in server then compile and restart and it is gone used to work on old source how do i do it now?


Thankyou For Taking The Time For Reading This I Hope You Can Help Ill be back in a few hours expecting no replies but maybe someone out there will help  :o</description>

<p>Now its my time to talk:</p>
<p>I suggest you get an old base: take phonescape or cheezscape 80. DO NOT MAKE A BIG SERVER THESE OLD SERVERS ARE GLITCHY!!! Instead read through the code, look at how shops and NPCs are spawned and look all through client.java Start to look at cases, packets e.t.c.</p>

<p>If it’s out of your area of expertise then how about you learn how to do it. What a concept. It’s not our responsibility to “give you the exact command and tell you exactly what to do with it”. Beggars can’t be choosers.</p>
