    <title>Something to work off</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/something-to-work-off/144163</link>
    <description>Hey people; does anyone know of a good source that is pretty clean, and with most skill&#39;s. 
I would really preffer it to be in the Download section.

Thank you;
Omerata.

Sorry about the lack of Info, but there isn&#39;t much more to say.</description>
