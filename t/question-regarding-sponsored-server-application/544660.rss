    <title>Question regarding sponsored server application</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-regarding-sponsored-server-application/544660</link>
    <description>Always when I post my application for my server it tells me to wait atleast 24-48 hours, idk why but it always seems to take longer than 48 hours to get accepted. Last year I got accepted 3 months in a row and the 4th month I didn&#39;t get accepted nor did I get declined for some weird reason. Five days have past since i should have gotten accepted/declined and it still says I need to wait, could someone please explain why this is happening or can someone of the staff help me out? Thanks in advance.</description>
