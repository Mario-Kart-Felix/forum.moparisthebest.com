[b] Well my other base failed  :P. I was about to just quit so I decided to use shard&#39;s its stable and I fixed a bunch of stuff on it. I added some of my codes that were in my other base. I think I made the combat system way better than the old one in the winterlove base.[/b]

 
 [size=20pt]What I have done so far[/size]
-Updated combat system. Its not 20 times better than the old one.
