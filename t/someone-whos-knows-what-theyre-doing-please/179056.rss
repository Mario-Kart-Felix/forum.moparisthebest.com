    <description>I need help. And everyone says the same thing. So i need someone to help me MORE than what everyone says because i&#39;ve done it all. So i wana get my server to work. I compile it, run it, and it works for JUST ME. on 0.0.0.0... I have No-Ip and i have it going to my IP and i dont even have a firewall. So can someone tell me what else could it be thats making my server not work for other people besides myself?</description>

Your server ip is whatever your ip is or your no-ip wich si like <a href="http://whateveryourservernameis.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whateveryourservernameis.no-ip.org</a> or whatever.<br>
