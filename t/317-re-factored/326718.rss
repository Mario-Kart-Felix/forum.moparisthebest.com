    <title>317 Re-factored</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-re-factored/326718</link>
    <description>Hello and welcome,

I have started a project to refactor a 317 client. I&#39;m going to keep this bit short and keep the content in the rest of the thread!

[I][U]Background[/U][/I]
This project started with my love for editing things and seeing the results of your edits. Not to mention my obsession with trying it on the Runescape client :D. I&#39;ve always wanted to do this, to see how it worked and just to be able to actually read the code and be able to know what it does. So I set out to do so in this project and have been working on it slowly for the past week, just doing it in my spare time for fun. I figured why should I keep this to myself and here I am, sharing it with you all. Now I am not only sharing this, I am willing to accept other people into helping me; read below to figure out how to join!

[I][U]Where to get the source[/U][/I]
You can get the source here: [url=https://code.google.com/p/rs2client/]https://code.google.com/p/rs2client/[/url]
The projects SVN is open to the public and will remain that way. I believe strongly in helping out others especially in a community such as this.

[I][U]How to Join[/U][/I]
Joining the project is really as simple as giving me your email that you use for Google code, and I will be happy to add you to the project. (With a little knowledge of seeing your name, so you don&#39;t just join to try and mess things up).



That&#39;s it short and sweet, I&#39;ll likely update this soon!


Thanks for reading!</description>

Alot of things are badly renamed, such as the entire texture class but it’s better than nothing.</p>
<p>Also, it’s source code, there should be alot more comments as to what stuff does, especially the methods.<br>
Good luck, and make daily backups, google will take it down as soon as they get the DMCA notice.</p>

              <p>You basically have to read through every bit of the client to do that.</p>
<p>Peter/Tom (who made Toms cache suite) can’t even fully refractor it.</p>
<p>Its incredibly hard to do it, and takes quite abit of knowledge.</p>

              <p>Hello and welcome,</p>
<p>I have started a project to refactor a 317 client. I’m going to keep this bit short and keep the content in the rest of the thread!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Background</span></span><br>
This project started with my love for editing things and seeing the results of your edits. Not to mention my obsession with trying it on the Runescape client :D. I’ve always wanted to do this, to see how it worked and just to be able to actually read the code and be able to know what it does. So I set out to do so in this project and have been working on it slowly for the past week, just doing it in my spare time for fun. I figured why should I keep this to myself and here I am, sharing it with you all. Now I am not only sharing this, I am willing to accept other people into helping me; read below to figure out how to join!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Where to get the source</span></span><br>
You can get the source here: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rs2client/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://code.google.com/p/rs2client/</a><br>
The projects SVN is open to the public and will remain that way. I believe strongly in helping out others especially in a community such as this.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">How to Join</span></span><br>
Joining the project is really as simple as giving me your email that you use for Google code, and I will be happy to add you to the project. (With a little knowledge of seeing your name, so you don’t just join to try and mess things up).</p>
<p>That’s it short and sweet, I’ll likely update this soon!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
