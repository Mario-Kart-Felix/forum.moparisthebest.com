    <title>Tutorial Island NPC BSH scripts</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-island-npc-bsh-scripts/342792</link>
    <description>Well i wrote these while i was bored, It&#39;s for xEnts bsh scripting system.

The script system isn&#39;t made for quest alike npcs like this, but its fixable.

I will add more when i can.

ID Unknown - Guide.bsh
[code]
NpcTalk(&quot;Welcome to the world of RuneScape&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;my job is to help newcomers find their feet here&quot;);
PlayerTalk(&quot;Ah good, let&#39;s get started&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;when speaking to characters such as myself&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Sometimes options will appear in the top left corner of the screen&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;left click on one of them to continue the conversation&quot;);

options = PickOption(&quot;So what else can you tell me?&quot;, &quot;What other controls do i have?&quot;);
if(options == 1) {
	NpcTalk(&quot;I suggest you to go through the  door now&quot;);
	NpcTalk(&quot;There are several guides and advisors on the island&quot;);
	NpcTalk(&quot;Speak to them&quot;);
	NpcTalk(&quot;They will teach you about the various aspects of the game&quot;);
	SendBoxAlert(&quot;Use the quest history tab at the bottom of the screen to reread things said to you by ingame characters&quot;, false);
}
if(options == 2) {
	NpcTalk(&quot;I suggest you to go through the  door now&quot;);
	NpcTalk(&quot;There are several guides and advisors on the island&quot;);
	NpcTalk(&quot;Speak to them&quot;);
	NpcTalk(&quot;They will teach you about the various aspects of the game&quot;);
	SendBoxAlert(&quot;Use the quest history tab at the bottom of the screen to reread things said to you by ingame characters&quot;, false);
}
[/code]

ID Unknown - controls guide.bsh
[code]
NpcTalk(&quot;Hello I&#39;m here to tell you more about the game&#39;s controls&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Most of your options and character information&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;can be accesed by the menus in the top right corner of the screen&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;moving your mouse over the map icon&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;which is the second icon from the right&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;gives you a view of the area you are in&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;clicking on this map is an effective way of walking around&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;though if the route is blocked, for example by a closed door&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;then your character won&#39;t move&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Also notice the compass on the map which may be of help to you&quot;);
PlayerTalk(&quot;Thankyou for your help&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Now carry on to speak to the combat instructor&quot;);
[/code]

ID Unknown - combat instructor.bsh
[code]
NpcTalk(&quot;Aha a new recruit&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;I&#39;m here to teach you the basics of fighting&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;First of all you need weapons&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;look after these well&quot;);
AddItem(BRONZE_LONGSWORD);
AddItem(WOODEN_SHIELD);
NpcTalk(&quot;These items will now have appeared in your inventory&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;You can access them by selecting the bag icon in the menu bar&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;which can be found in the top right hand corner of the screen&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;To wield your weapon and shield left click on them with your inventory&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;their box will go red to show you are wearing them&quot;);

//When wielding
NpcTalk(&quot;Today we&#39;re going to be killing giant rats&quot;);
NpcTalk(RAT)(&quot;squeek&quot;); //Making methods for this later
NpcTalk(&quot;move your mouse over a rat you will see it is level 7&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;If it is green this means you have a strong chance of killing it&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;creatures with their name in red should probably be avoided&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;As this indicates they are tougher than you&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;left click on the rat to attack it&quot;);

//Killed rat
SendMessage(&quot;Well done, you have killed the rat.&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Well done you&#39;re born fighter&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;As you kill things&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Your combat experience will go up&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;this expereince will slowly cause you to get tougher&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;eventually you will be able to tak on stronger enemies&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Such as those found in dungeons&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Now contine to the building to the northeast&quot;);
[/code]

ID Unknown - cooking instructor.bsh
[code]
NpcTalk(&quot;looks like you&#39;ve been fighting&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;If you get hurt in a fight&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;You will slowly heal&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Eating food will heal you much more quickly&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;I&#39;m here to show you some simple cooking&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;First you need something to cook&quot;);
SendMessage(&quot;cooking instructor hands you piece of beef&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;ok cook it on the range&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;To use an item you are holding&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Open your inventory and click on the item you wish to use&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Then click on whatever you wish to use it on&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;In this case use it on the range&quot;);


//Burnt meat, need some methods here.
PlayerTalk(&quot;I burn&#39;t the meant&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Well I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get the hang of it soon&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Let&#39;s try again&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Here&#39;s another piece of meat to cook.&quot;);

PlayerTalk(&quot;I&#39;ve cooked the meat correctly this time&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Very well done&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Now you can tell whether you need to eat or not&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;look in your stats menu&quot;);
PlayerTalk(&quot;I burn&#39;t the meant&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Well I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get the hang of it soon&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Let&#39;s try again&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Click on bar graph icon in the menu bar&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;Your stats are low right now&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;As you use the various skills, these stats will increase&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;If you look at your hits you will see 2 numbers&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;The number on the right is your hits when you are at full health&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;The number on the left is your current hits&quot;);
NpcTalk(&quot;If the number on the left is lower eat some food to be healed&quot;);
[/code]

If you do the tutorial island on RSC and test all possible situations, as well as walking back to the start, you will see that it’s really strange how it’s done.[/quote]I’m pretty sure adding a few things to script system would be easier.</p>
