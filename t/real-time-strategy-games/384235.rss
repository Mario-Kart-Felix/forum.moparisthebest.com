    <description>If you&#39;ve ever played one, what is your opinion on the gameplay? Can you name some good ones you have found?

Personally I like the concept; it&#39;s a great way to pass smaller amounts of time and then do something else for a while. 

The one I play currently is ok, it&#39;s called War Of Legends (published by Jagex), been playing it for a few months now.</description>

<p>The only reason the computers put up a good fight is at the start of death match they rush. The computer can do multiple things all at once while a player has to rush to every single event. I do not have any of the hot keys down. Might be easier if I choose a different civilization as well. Ottomans are only good for the villagers being auto built.[/quote]</p>
<p>Deathmatch eww. In a regular game ottomans are actually pretty strong, iirc janissaries are a lot stronger than muskets and you can’t easily counter them until age 3 where you get skirmishers, in which case 3 spahi will rape them with minimal janissary support.</p>
<p>Computers can multitask extremely well but late game they tend to neglect their economy and they never micro, at best they have a chance of countering your units if you tend to spam them but they always attack with huge armies and just send everything in letting the game mechanics choose what gets attacked. All you really need to do is defend your base so you have a strong economy then micro your army, even if it’s just something small like sending heavy cavalry to kill skirmishers, skirmishers to kill heavy infantry, heavy infantry to kill cavalry etc.</p>
<p>ps the only hotkeys you need to know are h builds a house, b builds/goes to barracks and v is to build villagers.</p>
