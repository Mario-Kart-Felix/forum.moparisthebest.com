    <title>Question about a &quot;Capturing Outpost&quot; npc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-a-capturing-outpost-npc/334155</link>
    <description>Ok so in my latest project theres 4 outpost your side wants to capture so you can tele there and defend it from the other team aswell as get better supplys from these outposts. The only thing is when you click on the npc to capture the outpost making your team tele to the defender spot not the attacking spot it only chanegs it for you. i want to know how to change it so everyone with [code]hween09 = 0[/code] gets there [code]0[/code] changed to [code]1[/code] and the other teams [code]hween09 = 1[/code] to be changed to [code]hween09 = 0[/code] This is the code i am using right now [code]if(NPCID == 57 &amp;&amp; hween09 &gt; 0) {
hween09 = 1;
sM(&quot;You have Captured this outpost for your faction.&quot;);
} else if(NPCID == 57 &amp;&amp; hween09 &gt; 1) {
hween09 = 0; }[/code]please help if you can  :)</description>

              <p>pulling out on a limb but maybe you could make it into a command so when u talk to the npc the command changes teleport spot for hole team but im not sure srry <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
heres the codes?:</p>
<p><code>if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("command name here")&amp;&amp; hween09 &gt;= 0){
teleportToX = absX;
teleportToY = absY;
isNpc = true;
npcId = 57;
hween09 = 1
} else if(hween09 &gt;= 1){
teleportToX = absX;
teleportToY = absY;
isNpc = true;
npcId = 57;
hween09 = 1
}</code><br>
but tbh im not sure and this is made by a command generator so u might have too tweak it</p>
