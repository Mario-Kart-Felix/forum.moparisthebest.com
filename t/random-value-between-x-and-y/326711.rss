    <title>Random value between X and Y</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/random-value-between-x-and-y/326711</link>
    <description>Hi all :)

It has been about 1,5 years since I&#39;ve typed my last } (on a Runescape server that is.)
And because of this, I became a little rusty on the even the most basic actions.

What I&#39;m trying to do, is have my script generate a random value between 2 values (lets say a value between 5 and 10).
I know about [b]misc.random[/b] but would this also work for generating a value between 2 values?
And if not, then how should i do this?

Regards,
