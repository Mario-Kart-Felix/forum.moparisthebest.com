    <title>Project Insanity Reworked [v1.0]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-reworked-v1-0/543224</link>
    <description>[B][U]Introduction[/U][/B]

Well I was bored so I decided to take a day off and completely rework the original Project Insanity source by Sanity. I had released this on rune-server about a month ago and forgot to release it here as well.




[U][B]What has changed?[/B][/U]

To put it frankly, a lot. If you wanna read a detailed description of everything I&#39;ve changed keep reading.

[SPOILER=&quot;Detailed description&quot;]
[U]- General cleanup[/U]

Removed all minigames and skills because they were horribly done. I also removed debugging messages, garbage collecting, auto saves, shutdown hooks and other stupid useless shit that people like to add into their servers.


[U]- Core design rework[/U]

That while loop in the Server class that ticks the server was pretty retarded, so I completely redesigned it and used a [I]ScheduledExecutorService[/I] to tick the actual logic instead. The benefits of that are if the main game thread ever crashes, as long as the networking thread is still running our executor will simply create a new thread to take the old ones place!


[U]- Reduced overhead[/U]

Cleaned out the process() method a little and removed &#39;object ticks&#39; because they aren&#39;t even used or needed. As a result of this and other modifications I made there should be a noticeable difference in performance when using this.


[U]- Concurrent utility loading[/U]

Similar to Graham&#39;s background loader, I made something to load utilities on startup concurrently. As long as they aren&#39;t conflicting its completely safe and much faster. I left documentation for people who don&#39;t understand what might be going on.


[U]- My own &#39;CycleEvent&#39;(s) implementation[/U]

I basically took the CycleEvent system from a typical PI and reworked it to have less overhead and more functionality. I did this instead of writing my own so you can follow tutorials using CycleEvents.


[U]- Merged the &#39;Client&#39; and &#39;Player&#39; classes[/U]

I merged the two classes together to form a single Player class. No more stupid casting and having to do other redundant shit because of bad design... thank me later.


[U]-  Entity system[/U]

Wrote an entity system! This now allows people to convert their combat to be entity based and write new entity based content! I also noticed how horrible the damage/secondary damage update block was and rewrote it to be better designed and support poison and disease hitmarks. You can now apply damage to either a player or npc (its exactly the same way for both, obviously because of the entity system) like this!

[CODE=java]player.dealDamage(new Hit(10)); // deals 10 damage with a red hitmark
player.dealDamage(new Hit(10, HitType.NORMAL));  // deals 10 damage with a red hitmark
player.dealDamage(new Hit(10, HitType.POISON));  // deals 10 damage with a green poison hitmark
player.dealDamage(new Hit(10, HitType.DISEASE));  // deals 10 damage with a golden-yellow disease hitmark
[/CODE]
[/SPOILER]




[U][B]Some things to keep in mind...[/B][/U]


[U]- DO NOT add 5535325352 task/event systems[/U]

This server already has one located in the [I]server.core.event[/I] package. Literally every Project Insanity I&#39;ve ever seen has like 5 different task systems. STOP! This isn&#39;t boosting performance at all, if anything its actually making your servers slower because they aren&#39;t even being used and instead just sit there idly using up all your resources. Oh and it gets better! There are a lot of task systems people like to add and use that run on their own dedicated thread which causes synchronization issues.


[U]- DO NOT use concurrent locks (&#39;synchronized(...) {&#39;)[/U]

... especially if you don&#39;t even know what they are for or what they do.

Yes they are needed in Project Insanity in [B]some[/B] places, but I see them used literally everywhere for no reason. All its doing is making your code slow and deadlock prone so please just stop.


[U]- DO NOT throw redundant code in the process() method[/U]

Its not for your timers or any other stupid shit, please just use an event or put it somewhere else.


[U]- DO use common sense[/U]

...


[U]- DO write entity based content[/U]

I wrote the system for a reason! An example of not entity based content, and entity based content:


[SPOILER=&quot;Entity based code example&quot;]
NOT entity based
[code=java] // one for players and npcs :( no entity system

public void actAFoolPlayer(Player player) {
     player.forceChat(&quot;ACT A FOOL&quot;); // player says this
     player.dealDamage(new Hit(10)); // player deals damage themself 
     player.animation(1000); // player does animation hitting themself
}

public void actAFoolNpc(Npc npc) {
     npc.forceChat(&quot;ACT A FOOL&quot;); // npc says this
     npc.dealDamage(new Hit(10)); // npc deals damage to itself
     npc.animation(1000); // npc does animation hitting themself
}[
[/code]


THIS is entity based
[code=java] // one method that works for both players and npcs! entity system!

public void actAFoolEntity(Entity entity) {
     entity.forceChat(&quot;ACT A FOOL&quot;); // entity says this
     entity.dealDamage(new Hit(10)); // entity deals damage to itself
     entity.animation(1000); // entity does animation hitting themself
}
[/code]
[/SPOILER]

<p>Because it doesn’t comply with OO programming design. Whilst programming you’re supposed to follow a predefined architecture, which provides an organised, readable system which allowed other people to use it, and makes it relatively similar to other designs. Sticking everything in the same class basically causes organisation / readability issues, doesn’t follow OOP, and looks ugly as f.</p>

<p>Runesource doesn’t have an entity system nor does it have any packaging lol so I didn’t rip code if that’s what you’re implying[/quote]</p>
<p>Nah, not implying anything of that sort. I’m just saying that it’s somewhat similar the way some things are set up, and I like it. Nice work.</p>

              <p>[B][U]Introduction[/U][/B]</p>
<p>Well I was bored so I decided to take a day off and completely rework the original Project Insanity source by Sanity. I had released this on rune-server about a month ago and forgot to release it here as well.</p>
<p>[U][B]What has changed?[/B][/U]</p>
<p>To put it frankly, a lot. If you wanna read a detailed description of everything I’ve changed keep reading.</p>
<p>[SPOILER=“Detailed description”]<br>
[U]- General cleanup[/U]</p>
<p>Removed all minigames and skills because they were horribly done. I also removed debugging messages, garbage collecting, auto saves, shutdown hooks and other stupid useless shit that people like to add into their servers.</p>
<p>[U]- Core design rework[/U]</p>
<p>That while loop in the Server class that ticks the server was pretty retarded, so I completely redesigned it and used a [I]ScheduledExecutorService[/I] to tick the actual logic instead. The benefits of that are if the main game thread ever crashes, as long as the networking thread is still running our executor will simply create a new thread to take the old ones place!</p>
<p>[U]- Reduced overhead[/U]</p>
<p>Cleaned out the process() method a little and removed ‘object ticks’ because they aren’t even used or needed. As a result of this and other modifications I made there should be a noticeable difference in performance when using this.</p>
<p>[U]- Concurrent utility loading[/U]</p>
<p>Similar to Graham’s background loader, I made something to load utilities on startup concurrently. As long as they aren’t conflicting its completely safe and much faster. I left documentation for people who don’t understand what might be going on.</p>
<p>[U]- My own ‘CycleEvent’(s) implementation[/U]</p>
<p>I basically took the CycleEvent system from a typical PI and reworked it to have less overhead and more functionality. I did this instead of writing my own so you can follow tutorials using CycleEvents.</p>
<p>[U]- Merged the ‘Client’ and ‘Player’ classes[/U]</p>
<p>I merged the two classes together to form a single Player class. No more stupid casting and having to do other redundant shit because of bad design… thank me later.</p>
<p>[U]-  Entity system[/U]</p>
<p>Wrote an entity system! This now allows people to convert their combat to be entity based and write new entity based content! I also noticed how horrible the damage/secondary damage update block was and rewrote it to be better designed and support poison and disease hitmarks. You can now apply damage to either a player or npc (its exactly the same way for both, obviously because of the entity system) like this!</p>
<p><code>player.dealDamage(new Hit(10)); // deals 10 damage with a red hitmark
player.dealDamage(new Hit(10, HitType.NORMAL));  // deals 10 damage with a red hitmark
player.dealDamage(new Hit(10, HitType.POISON));  // deals 10 damage with a green poison hitmark
player.dealDamage(new Hit(10, HitType.DISEASE));  // deals 10 damage with a golden-yellow disease hitmark
</code><br>
[/SPOILER]</p>
<p>[U][B]Some things to keep in mind…[/B][/U]</p>
<p>[U]- DO NOT add 5535325352 task/event systems[/U]</p>
<p>This server already has one located in the [I]server.core.event[/I] package. Literally every Project Insanity I’ve ever seen has like 5 different task systems. STOP! This isn’t boosting performance at all, if anything its actually making your servers slower because they aren’t even being used and instead just sit there idly using up all your resources. Oh and it gets better! There are a lot of task systems people like to add and use that run on their own dedicated thread which causes synchronization issues.</p>
<p>[U]- DO NOT use concurrent locks (‘synchronized(…) {’)[/U]</p>
<p>… especially if you don’t even know what they are for or what they do.</p>
<p>Yes they are needed in Project Insanity in [B]some[/B] places, but I see them used literally everywhere for no reason. All its doing is making your code slow and deadlock prone so please just stop.</p>
<p>[U]- DO NOT throw redundant code in the process() method[/U]</p>
<p>Its not for your timers or any other stupid shit, please just use an event or put it somewhere else.</p>
<p>[U]- DO use common sense[/U]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[U]- DO write entity based content[/U]</p>
<p>I wrote the system for a reason! An example of not entity based content, and entity based content:</p>
<p>[SPOILER=“Entity based code example”]<br>
NOT entity based</p>
<p>[code=java] // one for players and npcs <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> no entity system</p>
<p>public void actAFoolPlayer(Player player) {<br>
player.forceChat(“ACT A FOOL”); // player says this<br>
player.dealDamage(new Hit(10)); // player deals damage themself<br>
player.animation(1000); // player does animation hitting themself<br>
}</p>
<p>public void actAFoolNpc(Npc npc) {<br>
npc.forceChat(“ACT A FOOL”); // npc says this<br>
npc.dealDamage(new Hit(10)); // npc deals damage to itself<br>
npc.animation(1000); // npc does animation hitting themself<br>
}[<br>
[/code]</p>
<p>THIS is entity based</p>
<p>[code=java] // one method that works for both players and npcs! entity system!</p>
<p>public void actAFoolEntity(Entity entity) {<br>
entity.forceChat(“ACT A FOOL”); // entity says this<br>
entity.dealDamage(new Hit(10)); // entity deals damage to itself<br>
entity.animation(1000); // entity does animation hitting themself<br>
}<br>
[/code]<br>
