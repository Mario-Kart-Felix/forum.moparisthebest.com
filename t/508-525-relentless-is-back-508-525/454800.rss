[SIZE=&quot;3&quot;][COLOR=&quot;White&quot;]SERVER NEWLY RE-OPENED AND WE NEED STAFF MEMBERS[/COLOR][/SIZE]

Hey everyone - Mikee here letting you know I&#39;m bringing back Relentless.

[B][U]Relentless Past:[/U][/B]
Shahir (Shassan on Rune-Server) started Relentless back in 2008 as a 508 server. I wasn&#39;t with Relentless from the start but I joined a short while after it was created, worked my way up to being the Co Owner. After a while when the &#39;z508 loading 525 cache&#39; servers came out Shahir used that as the base for Relentless. Relentless gradually grew into a big server and one summer we had 200+ on everyday. I still get asked from people after all this time to bring Relentless back so I decided I will.

[B][U]Relentless Future:[/U][/B]
My main focus when making this new server is trying to appeal to the old Relentless players aswell as new players. For example: On the old Relentless people who wanted to be skillers would complain about the lack of skills. Therefore I plan to make Relentless a place for everyone by adding lots of cool content to the game.

[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER=&quot;Relentless Bounty Hunter&quot;][b][u]Relentless Bounty Hunter:[/u][/b]

I&#39;m sure the old Relentless players remember the old Bounty Hunter system which was pretty good but not perfect. Well I&#39;ve made alot of changed/improvements to the system and I&#39;m sure you will find that it&#39;s near flawless. Relentless Bounty Hunter is different from all other Bounty Hunter mini-games because it has [B]all three Bounty Hunter craters[/B] working. In addition to that I have coded [B]viewing orbs and scoreboards[/B] both 100% and fully functional. Our low crater Bounty Hunter only allows players with combat levels ranging bettween 3-55, the med crater 56-95, and high crater 96+(You&#39;ll find that most other servers only have one crater working). The target finder has been recoded to work 100% and no longer assigns targets whom are outside the mini-game(A common glitch on most other servers). In addition the system has also been re-coded so that players may not be piled by large groups of players. Basically the system will not assign more than two people the same target. Theoretically if two players would get the same target then their target would be only be able to be attacked by those two players and a target of their own(If they had been assigned one). This makes the [B]maximum number of players who can attack you at a time three(four if already engaged in combat with non-target related opponent).[/B]
[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER=&quot;Other Stuff(Common Glitches Fixed/Stuff Added)&quot;][b][u]Other Stuff(Common Glitches Fixed/Stuff Added):[/u][/b]

508 and 508/525 servers have come a long way in the past time, but most people complain a lot about some common glitches that most of the 508 servers have in common. I have however fixed most of these major and minor glitches.

[U][B]Item Disappearing([url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXEXQZqLgw0]YouTube - 508/525 100% X Logging Fix and More[/url])[/B][/U]
Say you die at Mage Bank with your FireCape, Bgloves, Rune Defender and all that. You run back to loot it and you find it&#39;s not there. I&#39;ve fixed this glitch 100%

[B][U]X Logging([url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXEXQZqLgw0]YouTube - 508/525 100% X Logging Fix and More[/url])[/U][/B]
Most server have crappy fixes for X Logging, for example when you login with zero hitpoints you die or lose all your items or something along those lines. Those are all good ideas, but I had a better one. I thought, hey why not just have it so when you close the client it doesn&#39;t log you out(how it should be).

[B][U]Wilderness/PvP Timer[/U][/B]
This is the 10 second timer that goes into effect when you leave a PvP Area while in, or recenty in, combat. Most people say that this has already been released, but first of all the coding is crappy and it doesn&#39;t work half the time. I&#39;ve created one that&#39;s totally different coding and works x1000 better than the usual one people use.

[B]Divine/Elysian Effects([url=http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Divine_spirit_shield]Divine spirit shield - The RuneScape Wiki - Skills, quests, guides, items, monsters and more[/url] : [url=http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Elysian_spirit_shield]Elysian spirit shield - The RuneScape Wiki - Skills, quests, guides, items, monsters and more[/url])[/B]
The effects for both Divine and Elysian spirit shields are fully coded. This brings a great balance to the economy so people won&#39;t just want the Arcanes and Spectrals.

[B][U]Dharok&#39;s Glitch[/U][/B]
A popular glitch on 508 and 508/525 servers. This glitch was performed by using your Dharok&#39;s axe, and what you would do it hit someone using the axe, but before the hit splat shows up you quickly would switch to another weapon which would have the effects of the full Dharok&#39;s. This would basically mean that anyone abusing this glitch at a low hit points level would have quite an advantage over the other player.
[/SPOILER]


[B][COLOR=&quot;Yellow&quot;]If you missed it, client and download are at the top.[/COLOR][/B][/CENTER]</description>

<p>[SPOILER=“Relentless Bounty Hunter”]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Relentless Bounty Hunter:</span></span></p>
<p>I’m sure the old Relentless players remember the old Bounty Hunter system which was pretty good but not perfect. Well I’ve made alot of changed/improvements to the system and I’m sure you will find that it’s near flawless. Relentless Bounty Hunter is different from all other Bounty Hunter mini-games because it has <span class="bbcode-b">all three Bounty Hunter craters</span> working. In addition to that I have coded <span class="bbcode-b">viewing orbs and scoreboards</span> both 100% and fully functional. Our low crater Bounty Hunter only allows players with combat levels ranging bettween 3-55, the med crater 56-95, and high crater 96+(You’ll find that most other servers only have one crater working). The target finder has been recoded to work 100% and no longer assigns targets whom are outside the mini-game(A common glitch on most other servers). In addition the system has also been re-coded so that players may not be piled by large groups of players. Basically the system will not assign more than two people the same target. Theoretically if two players would get the same target then their target would be only be able to be attacked by those two players and a target of their own(If they had been assigned one). This makes the <span class="bbcode-b">maximum number of players who can attack you at a time three(four if already engaged in combat with non-target related opponent).</span><br>
[/SPOILER]</p>
<p>[SPOILER=“Other Stuff(Common Glitches Fixed/Stuff Added)”]<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Other Stuff(Common Glitches Fixed/Stuff Added):</span></span></p>
<p>508 and 508/525 servers have come a long way in the past time, but most people complain a lot about some common glitches that most of the 508 servers have in common. I have however fixed most of these major and minor glitches.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Item Disappearing(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXEXQZqLgw0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube - 508/525 100% X Logging Fix and More</a>)</span></span><br>
Say you die at Mage Bank with your FireCape, Bgloves, Rune Defender and all that. You run back to loot it and you find it’s not there. I’ve fixed this glitch 100%</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">X Logging(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXEXQZqLgw0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube - 508/525 100% X Logging Fix and More</a>)</span></span><br>
Most server have crappy fixes for X Logging, for example when you login with zero hitpoints you die or lose all your items or something along those lines. Those are all good ideas, but I had a better one. I thought, hey why not just have it so when you close the client it doesn’t log you out(how it should be).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Wilderness/PvP Timer</span></span><br>
This is the 10 second timer that goes into effect when you leave a PvP Area while in, or recenty in, combat. Most people say that this has already been released, but first of all the coding is crappy and it doesn’t work half the time. I’ve created one that’s totally different coding and works x1000 better than the usual one people use.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Divine/Elysian Effects(<a href="http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Divine_spirit_shield" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Divine spirit shield - The RuneScape Wiki - Skills, quests, guides, items, monsters and more</a> : <a href="http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Elysian_spirit_shield" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Elysian spirit shield - The RuneScape Wiki - Skills, quests, guides, items, monsters and more</a>)</span><br>
The effects for both Divine and Elysian spirit shields are fully coded. This brings a great balance to the economy so people won’t just want the Arcanes and Spectrals.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Dharok’s Glitch</span></span><br>
A popular glitch on 508 and 508/525 servers. This glitch was performed by using your Dharok’s axe, and what you would do it hit someone using the axe, but before the hit splat shows up you quickly would switch to another weapon which would have the effects of the full Dharok’s. This would basically mean that anyone abusing this glitch at a low hit points level would have quite an advantage over the other player.<br>
