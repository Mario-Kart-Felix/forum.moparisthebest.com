    <title>&quot;Client has been updated&quot; Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-has-been-updated-help/441806</link>
    <description>So basically I want to make my PI client to were if I update my server and add new models and such to a new client, I want to be able to make it so that people with older clients can&#39;t log in, because usually it causes alot of problems for them such as not seeing players with new items, and most people don&#39;t know to update the client so I want that message to happen... but

I don&#39;t know how to implement this, if anyone can redirect me to a tutorial or knows the general concept of it, please let me know, your support will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

What my Client.java says for what I am explaining:
[code]if(k == 6)
			{
				loginMessage1 = &quot;Client has been updated!&quot;;
				loginMessage2 = &quot;Please download our updated client.&quot;;
				return;
			}[/code]
I basically just want that to work when I make new clients, not sure how.</description>
