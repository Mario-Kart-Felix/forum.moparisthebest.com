    <title>A file that sets your EV and runs the client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-file-that-sets-your-ev-and-runs-the-client/423379</link>
    <description>How would I go about making a .cmd file that once the person runs, it checks what jdk he has and/or sets his EV for him, then changed the run.bat file to the jdk he has?

eg. he has jdk 1.6.0_22 and in my run.bat it has &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_23\bin\java.exe&quot;, and then he runs and changes it to &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_22\bin\java.exe&quot; ??</description>
