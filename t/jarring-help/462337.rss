    <description>Im using the Eclipse 639 Client, i have jarred it, it all works fine i can log in and everything but the only problem is, its 23MB?

What files do i need for it to work, when i tried only Jarring the .class files the client wouldnt run so i just Jarred the whole client folder and it works..

what are the files i need so it can work, but only be normal size like 1.5MB not 23MB..

Help is appreciated.</description>
