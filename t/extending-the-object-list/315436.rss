    <title>Extending the Object List?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/extending-the-object-list/315436</link>
    <description>Anyone know how to extend the object list? Because I added the bounty hunter object map and I have the objects hardcoded in. When I compile I get no errors, but when it tries to load them I get an outofbounds exception. So, I&#39;m pretty sure if I extend my object list it&#39;ll fix this problem. If anyone knows how please tell me.

                                                                   Thanks, Moose[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 22, 2009, 04:08:50 pm[/size][hr]No one knows how to do this? I figured a lot of people already had extended their object lists...</description>
