    <title>[718] A Coder or Two Needed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-a-coder-or-two-needed/537469</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I am currently needing a coder (MAYBE two), who is fluent in Java to help me with my server. 

Also, I&#39;m sorta new to Java, (not extremely new to coding, as I&#39;m well-oriented with Visual Basic &amp; Python.) But there are a fair amount of things that I&#39;m not the best at when it comes to this language. I can understand the majority of it, but I need a decent amount of knowledge if I&#39;m going to make a successful server.

Now, if you are/have most of the following , than you just might be my guy/girl:


[center]Ability to work WELL with another person (listening to ideas, constructive criticism, etc.)
Able to talk in a little bit more simplistic way with Java (I&#39;m not the smartest guy in the world)
Skype (HIGHLY recommended)
A decent amount of EXPERIENCE with Java, along with the knowledge.
My age or older (15, and this is for maturity reasons)
Dedicated, hard-working, not quitting easily, and the ability to have fun the whole time =)[/center]






[u][b]Notes about the server[/b][/u]:

This server is Citellum 718 loading a 742 cache.

The server is hosted on MY computer (don&#39;t worry, 8 GBs will get it done. =)




If you have any questions, or are interested in joining, feel free to add me on Skype: adamtheman88

Thanks in advance,



[size=18pt]-Moidz[/size]


EDIT: I forgot to mention that I will probably need a Web Dev as well.</description>
