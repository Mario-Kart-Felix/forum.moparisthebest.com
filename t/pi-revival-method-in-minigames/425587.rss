    <title>Pi revival method in minigames?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-revival-method-in-minigames/425587</link>
    <description>Ok so i was remaking the whole pest control for pi with shifters and void knight all i need to know is where is the correct file i can add the dead method like i can do a switch case method or if statement like if player in c.pestcontrol 
If players dies c.moveplayer (coords) and not delete their items on death

So what i tried well i checked the applydead method in playerassistant.java but im not exactly sure where to add it</description>
