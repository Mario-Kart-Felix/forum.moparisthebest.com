    <description>hi apparently my friend cant get on my client but he connect with silabssoft&#39;s client
when i checked the status page for runelocus it came out like this [img]http://www.runelocus.com/tools/statusimg.php?server=taronascape.no-ip.org:43594[/img]
i can connect successfully into my client with my server but my friends or other 3rd party people cant connect 
why cant my client access others to my server but silabsoft can now my friends also tried other clients to access it as well but it still wouldnt connect 
my base server is project czar i really need help on this ive been trying to solve this for about 2 weeks havent got a good solving answer 
thanks for reading this  :)</description>

              <p>Maybe the clients have custom id’s and they are using the silabsoft id, like they’re maybe wearing a skillcape and on the clients id the skillcape is different. That might be it.</p>
