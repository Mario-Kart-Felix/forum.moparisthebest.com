    <title>My friend cant connect to my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-friend-cant-connect-to-my-client/194571</link>
    <description>hi apparently my friend cant get on my client but he connect with silabssoft&#39;s client
when i checked the status page for runelocus it came out like this [img]http://www.runelocus.com/tools/statusimg.php?server=taronascape.no-ip.org:43594[/img]
i can connect successfully into my client with my server but my friends or other 3rd party people cant connect 
why cant my client access others to my server but silabsoft can now my friends also tried other clients to access it as well but it still wouldnt connect 

i have also tried the following like everyone told me to 
 - take out all custom items i had and obtained
 - get someone else to go on the cleint that wasnt a member of my private server
 - use another client to get on my server (that didnt work either)

my base server is project czar i really need help on this ive been trying to solve this for about 2 weeks havent got a good solving answer 
thanks for reading this  :) hopefully i can solve this.... :(</description>
