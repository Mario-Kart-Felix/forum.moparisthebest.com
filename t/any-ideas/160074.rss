    <description>Ok I play this game called Maple Story i&#39;m trying to make a private server I got access to their .WZ files which for them has all of their info on it such as background music, skills, items etc. I was wondering would there be any way that I could make a private server off of all of the information that they give in their .WZ files like I already got some of their map files saved onto my computer. Also I saved some of their info as a html file so that it tells me the X and Y cords of the Portals and it tells me the Hieght and the Width of the map and where all the objects are spawned at.

So my question is if I have all of this information how would I make a server?</description>

              <p>Ok i got most of the important files such as…<br>
Music, Animations, Character looks, Skin color, Weapons, Hitting Animation, All clothes, All Sheilds, And I have all the information on where to put the Ropes, Portals, and etc.<br>
I don’t know if I can get the server files but I’m gonna see if I can make it without the server files.</p>
<p>Questions :<br>
Anyone know a program that I can edit .Dll files and or make .Dll files. Also does anyone know if there is a way to compile all the .Dll files together? Also is there a way that I can make it connect to a server ip so that I can get more then 1 person on it.</p>
<p>Anyone know a program that can open Wz files and paste all the info into a folder.</p>
