    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/css-simple-css-tutorial-css/452967</link>
    <description>Hello, Mopar.

It&#39;s been a short while since I done any kind of tutorial, so I thought I may aswell write another one. Unlike my others, this is based around CSS. This is used in web design. Below is a small introduction to CSS.

This will allow you to take your web designing skills to the next level with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With CSS you will be able to:

- Add new looks to your old HTML
- Completely restyle a web site with only a few changes to your CSS code
- Use the &quot;style&quot; you create on any webpage you wish!

All CSS files end in the extension .css, most commonly in website design you&#39;ll find the file is named &quot;style.css&quot;, this holds the main key to the entire styling of the web page.

All I&#39;m going to show you is the basics of CSS, this will cover:
- Selectors
- Background
- External
- Class
- Font
- Text
- Padding
- Links

Without further ado, here is the beginning of the tutorial:

[b]Selectors[/b]
A lot of people don&#39;t know these as Selectors, as they&#39;re just your regular CSS statement, this consists of:
[code=css]
Selector { 
Property: VALUE; 
}
[/code]

This would be used as:
[code=css]
body {
width: auto;
}
[/code]

[b]Background[/b]
Backgrounds are obviously very important to creating your first web page, otherwise everything looks hideous. That&#39;s why I have included it second, so that if you&#39;re playing with CSS as you&#39;re following this tutorial, you can see how it works.
[code=css]
body {
width: auto;
background-color: #FFFF00;
}
[/code]
If I remember correctly, that will give you a red background. The only thing I doubt is the HEX code.

You could also do this if you had an image, it&#39;d look like this:
[code=css]
body {
width: auto;
background-image: url(pathToYourImage/image.png);
}
[/code]

You could then repeat that image and show what way to repeat it by doing this: 
[code=css]
body {
width: auto;
background-image: url(pathToYourImage/image.png);
background-repeat: repeat-x;
[/code]

If you wanted to repeat it along the Y axis, it would be &quot;repeat-y&quot; if you didn&#39;t want to repeat it &quot;no-repeat&quot;. Simple, right?

[b]External CSS[/b]
External CSS is when you load your CSS from an outside file, such as style.css. This isn&#39;t the only way of loading CSS, however, it is the tidiest so we&#39;ll use that. There&#39;s also internal and inline CSS, but you can Google them if you want to know more. This also allows you to use the same file for another page, instead of copying all the code, you just include it in a line.

So, open up your text editor and put in this code:
[code=css]
body {
width: auto;
background-color: #FFFF00;
}
p {
color: green;
}
[/code]

Save that file as style.css.

Then open up your text editor again and put this in it:
[code=HTML]
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This paragraph has a green font with a red background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

Simple enough, right?

[b]Classes[/b]
You may be wondering if it is possible to give an HTML element multiple looks with CSS. Say for example that sometimes you want the font to be large and white, while other times you would prefer the font to be small and black. CSS would not be very useful if it did not allow you to have many different types of formats for a single HTML tag. Well, you are in luck! CSS allows you to do just that with the use of classes.

Using classes is simple. You just need to add an extension to the typical CSS code and make sure you specify this extension in your HTML. Let&#39;s try this with an example of making two paragraphs that behave differently. First, we begin with the CSS code.
[code=css]
p.first { 
color: blue; 
}
p.second { 
color: red; 
}
[/code]
[code=HTML]
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a normal paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;first&quot;&gt;This is a paragraph that uses the p.first CSS code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;second&quot;&gt;This is a paragraph that uses the p.second CSS code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

NOTE: CSS code in classes will override the general CSS code for that element. p.test1 overrides p!

[b]Font &amp; Text[/b]

Font Color;
Although the color of the text seems like it would be part of CSS Font, it actually is a standalone attribute in CSS. This could be for many reasons, including the fact that it will be used a great deal, so why make the coder type out &quot;font-color&quot;, when they could just type out &quot;color&quot; instead? Here&#39;s an example of changing the color of your font.
[code=css]
h4 { 
color: #FF0000; 
}

h5 { 
color: #FFFF00; 
} 

h6 { 
color: #00FFFF; 
} 
[/code]

Font Family;
Font families can be divided into two groups: serif and sans-serif. A sans-serif font does not include the small lines at the end of characters, while a serif font does include these small lines. When choosing which kind you prefer, remember that studies have shown that sans-serif fonts are much easier to read on a computer monitor than serif fonts.
[code=css]
h4 { 
font-family: sans-serif; 
}

h5 { 
font-family: serif; 
} 

h6 
{ font-family: arial; 
} 
[/code]

Font Size;
You can manipulate the size of your fonts by using values, percentages, or key terms. Using values are useful if you do not want the user to be able to increase the size of the font because your site will look incorrect if they did so. Percentages are great when you want to change the default font, but do not want to set a static value. Note: Some browsers now have a &quot;Zoom&quot; feature, so it will allow users to make your website bigger or smaller and static values will grow larger/smaller as well.
[code=css]
p { 
font-size: 120%; 
} 

ol{ 
font-size: 10px; 
} 

ul{ 
font-size: x-large; 
}
[/code]

Font Style;
CSS Font-Style is where you define if your font will be italic or not. Possible key terms are the following: italic, oblique, and normal.
[code=css]
p { 
font-style: italic; 
}

h4 { 
font-style: oblique; 
}
[/code]

Font Weight;
If you want to control the weight of your font (its thickness), using font weight is the best way to go about it. We suggest that you only use font-weight in multiples of 100 (e.g. 200, 300, etc) because any less and you probably will not see any difference. The values range from 100 (thin)-900 (thick).
[code=css]
p { 
font-weight: 100; 
} 

ul{ 
font-weight: bolder; 
}
[/code]

Font Variant;
CSS Font Variant allows you to convert your font to all small caps. Note: not every font supports CSS Font Variant, so be sure to test before you publish.
[code=css]
p { 
font-variant: small-caps; 
}
[/code]

Simple enough?

[b]Padding[/b]
Four padding values can be declared at once by either specifying two or four values. When only using two values, the first will define the padding on the top and bottom, while the second will define the padding on the left and right.

When using the four value padding specification, the corresponding directions are: top, right, bottom, left. To help you remember what the order is, just remember that it starts at the top and then moves clockwise until it reaches the left. The examples below shows partial (2) and complete (4) padding usage.
[code=css]
p {
    padding: 5px 15px; 
    border: 1px solid black; 
}  
h5{
    padding: 0px 5px 10px 3px; 
    border: 1px solid red;
} 
[/code]

[b]Links[/b]
Probably the coolest thing about CSS is that it gives you the ability to add effects to your anchor tags, otherwise known as links. In HTML, the only way to add this effect would be to use JavaScript, but with the addition of CSS, JavaScript links can be forgotten. You may not know it, but a link has four different states that it can be in. CSS allows you to customize each state. Please refer to the following keywords that each correspond to one specific state:

[b]link [/b]- this is a link that has not been used, nor is a mouse pointer	hovering over it
[b]visited [/b]- this is a link that has been used before, but has no mouse on it
[b]hover [/b]- this is a link currently has a mouse pointer hovering over it/on it
[b]active [/b]- this is a link that is in the process of being clicked

Using CSS you can make a different look for each one of these states.

Here&#39;s some sample CSS code:
[code=css]
a:link { 
color: red; 
text-decoration: 
none; 
}
a:visited {
color: red; 
text-decoration: 
none; 
} 
a:hover { 
color: blue; 
} 
[/code]

I honestly cannot be fucked writing anymore, this took around an hour and half so deal with it. If you want more information, google it or read over some style.css files to get the feel for them.

With utmost regards,
Ruby.</description>

Well yeah, I think they added the alpha channel or something, making it RGBA, it’s weird. The last thing you can do is just do background-color: red;<br>

Honestly, I don’t like hex. When i get tired of it (because the color combinations are just endless), I use RGB format:<br>

<p>I’ve never actually bothered to screw around with the RGB format, it just seems much more confusing than the problems it would solve.</p>

<p>Might also want to change the </p><p> tag to the <span> tag because <span> is more widely used with classes. Either way it works. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></span></span></p>
<p>Edit: Post a link to webkit for CSS3 too. That would also be good.</p>

              <p>Hello, Mopar.</p>
<p>It’s been a short while since I done any kind of tutorial, so I thought I may aswell write another one. Unlike my others, this is based around CSS. This is used in web design. Below is a small introduction to CSS.</p>
<p>This will allow you to take your web designing skills to the next level with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). With CSS you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new looks to your old HTML</li>
<li>Completely restyle a web site with only a few changes to your CSS code</li>
<li>Use the “style” you create on any webpage you wish!</li>
</ul>
<p>All CSS files end in the extension .css, most commonly in website design you’ll find the file is named “style.css”, this holds the main key to the entire styling of the web page.</p>
<p>All I’m going to show you is the basics of CSS, this will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selectors</li>
<li>Background</li>
<li>External</li>
<li>Class</li>
<li>Font</li>
<li>Text</li>
<li>Padding</li>
<li>Links</li>
</ul>
<p>Without further ado, here is the beginning of the tutorial:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Selectors</span><br>
A lot of people don’t know these as Selectors, as they’re just your regular CSS statement, this consists of:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Selector { 
Property: VALUE; 
}</code></pre>
<p>This would be used as:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">body {
width: auto;
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Background</span><br>
Backgrounds are obviously very important to creating your first web page, otherwise everything looks hideous. That’s why I have included it second, so that if you’re playing with CSS as you’re following this tutorial, you can see how it works.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">body {
width: auto;
background-color: #FFFF00;
}</code></pre>
<p>If I remember correctly, that will give you a red background. The only thing I doubt is the HEX code.</p>
<p>You could also do this if you had an image, it’d look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">body {
width: auto;
background-image: url(pathToYourImage/image.png);
}</code></pre>
<p>You could then repeat that image and show what way to repeat it by doing this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">body {
width: auto;
background-image: url(pathToYourImage/image.png);
background-repeat: repeat-x;</code></pre>
<p>If you wanted to repeat it along the Y axis, it would be “repeat-y” if you didn’t want to repeat it “no-repeat”. Simple, right?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">External CSS</span><br>
External CSS is when you load your CSS from an outside file, such as style.css. This isn’t the only way of loading CSS, however, it is the tidiest so we’ll use that. There’s also internal and inline CSS, but you can Google them if you want to know more. This also allows you to use the same file for another page, instead of copying all the code, you just include it in a line.</p>
<p>So, open up your text editor and put in this code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">body {
width: auto;
background-color: #FFFF00;
}
p {
color: green;
}</code></pre>
<p>Save that file as style.css.</p>
<p>Then open up your text editor again and put this in it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This paragraph has a green font with a red background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Simple enough, right?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Classes</span><br>
You may be wondering if it is possible to give an HTML element multiple looks with CSS. Say for example that sometimes you want the font to be large and white, while other times you would prefer the font to be small and black. CSS would not be very useful if it did not allow you to have many different types of formats for a single HTML tag. Well, you are in luck! CSS allows you to do just that with the use of classes.</p>
<p>Using classes is simple. You just need to add an extension to the typical CSS code and make sure you specify this extension in your HTML. Let’s try this with an example of making two paragraphs that behave differently. First, we begin with the CSS code.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p.first { 
color: blue; 
}
p.second { 
color: red; 
}</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a normal paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first"&gt;This is a paragraph that uses the p.first CSS code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="second"&gt;This is a paragraph that uses the p.second CSS code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: CSS code in classes will override the general CSS code for that element. p.test1 overrides p!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Font &amp; Text</span></p>
<p>Font Color;<br>
Although the color of the text seems like it would be part of CSS Font, it actually is a standalone attribute in CSS. This could be for many reasons, including the fact that it will be used a great deal, so why make the coder type out “font-color”, when they could just type out “color” instead? Here’s an example of changing the color of your font.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">h4 { 
color: #FF0000; 
}

h5 { 
color: #FFFF00; 
} 

h6 { 
color: #00FFFF; 
} </code></pre>
<p>Font Family;<br>
Font families can be divided into two groups: serif and sans-serif. A sans-serif font does not include the small lines at the end of characters, while a serif font does include these small lines. When choosing which kind you prefer, remember that studies have shown that sans-serif fonts are much easier to read on a computer monitor than serif fonts.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">h4 { 
font-family: sans-serif; 
}

h5 { 
font-family: serif; 
} 

h6 
{ font-family: arial; 
} </code></pre>
<p>Font Size;<br>
You can manipulate the size of your fonts by using values, percentages, or key terms. Using values are useful if you do not want the user to be able to increase the size of the font because your site will look incorrect if they did so. Percentages are great when you want to change the default font, but do not want to set a static value. Note: Some browsers now have a “Zoom” feature, so it will allow users to make your website bigger or smaller and static values will grow larger/smaller as well.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p { 
font-size: 120%; 
} 

ol{ 
font-size: 10px; 
} 

ul{ 
font-size: x-large; 
}</code></pre>
<p>Font Style;<br>
CSS Font-Style is where you define if your font will be italic or not. Possible key terms are the following: italic, oblique, and normal.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p { 
font-style: italic; 
}

h4 { 
font-style: oblique; 
}</code></pre>
<p>Font Weight;<br>
If you want to control the weight of your font (its thickness), using font weight is the best way to go about it. We suggest that you only use font-weight in multiples of 100 (e.g. 200, 300, etc) because any less and you probably will not see any difference. The values range from 100 (thin)-900 (thick).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p { 
font-weight: 100; 
} 

ul{ 
font-weight: bolder; 
}</code></pre>
<p>Font Variant;<br>
CSS Font Variant allows you to convert your font to all small caps. Note: not every font supports CSS Font Variant, so be sure to test before you publish.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p { 
font-variant: small-caps; 
}</code></pre>
<p>Simple enough?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Padding</span><br>
Four padding values can be declared at once by either specifying two or four values. When only using two values, the first will define the padding on the top and bottom, while the second will define the padding on the left and right.</p>
<p>When using the four value padding specification, the corresponding directions are: top, right, bottom, left. To help you remember what the order is, just remember that it starts at the top and then moves clockwise until it reaches the left. The examples below shows partial (2) and complete (4) padding usage.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p {
    padding: 5px 15px; 
    border: 1px solid black; 
}  
h5{
    padding: 0px 5px 10px 3px; 
    border: 1px solid red;
} </code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Links</span><br>
Probably the coolest thing about CSS is that it gives you the ability to add effects to your anchor tags, otherwise known as links. In HTML, the only way to add this effect would be to use JavaScript, but with the addition of CSS, JavaScript links can be forgotten. You may not know it, but a link has four different states that it can be in. CSS allows you to customize each state. Please refer to the following keywords that each correspond to one specific state:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">link </span>- this is a link that has not been used, nor is a mouse pointer	hovering over it<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">visited </span>- this is a link that has been used before, but has no mouse on it<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">hover </span>- this is a link currently has a mouse pointer hovering over it/on it<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">active </span>- this is a link that is in the process of being clicked</p>
<p>Using CSS you can make a different look for each one of these states.</p>
<p>Here’s some sample CSS code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">a:link { 
color: red; 
text-decoration: 
none; 
}
a:visited {
color: red; 
text-decoration: 
none; 
} 
a:hover { 
color: blue; 
} </code></pre>
<p>I honestly cannot be fucked writing anymore, this took around an hour and half so deal with it. If you want more information, google it or read over some style.css files to get the feel for them.</p>
<p>With utmost regards,<br>
Ruby.</p>
