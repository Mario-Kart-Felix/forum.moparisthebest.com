    <description>I just wanted to know if there is anything i could fix whteher it be downloading a program for typing or something like that.  But often when I want to edit a player or item bonuses etc. it comes up with many leters/figits just being boxes.

Is there anyway I could fix it?

it is usually the files that were written in a program that i don&#39;t have.</description>
