    <description>kk well atm im using d-link dir 628 model router
 i portforwarded it with the ports it had set default and all and i connected to live, it worked,i can talk to ppl, download stuff, but the only thing that doesnt work, is connecting to other players, e.g go to halo3 matchmaking says, info cannot be recieved from the halo 3 server and any other game same thing, says a connection problem. i take it theres a port problem or a firewall, but i made all endpoints indenependant etc, idk what else is the problem, am i missing ports? i tried xbox forums they said its because i have satallite internet, well my belkin router works with it fine, but its slower than my d link and has a bad connection to players, and my d link is ALOT better so obviously that cant be the reason.
im also having the same  damn problem with my rsps, no one else can connect. if anyone needs any pics or info of anything ill gladly send it because i wanna make this 12 month subscription worth the money. :p

thanks,

              <p>i think this might be the solution: you said you have sattalite internet right? if you do well theres your problem! sattalite internet has something called “time lag” or something like that, because it has to travel to sattalites around the world to get to you. well, you cannot play multiplayer because of this lag, and even if it let you, it would be like playing on dial up (you would be playing and you would die for no reason) so the simple solution: get a DSL/cable/ethernet etc. internet service, just as long as its high speed and not sattalite</p>
<p>hope i helped</p>
