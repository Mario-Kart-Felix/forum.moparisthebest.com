    <description>Well i have thought of to bring all those good coders all together to code a server, this server will also needed a cilent, codes, lots of members.
We will need alot of coders for this server as it needs to be perfect, if you wish to join then you may tell us your abilities to code.
If you are not that very good at coding and would like to join the i am very sorry, the server is not yet downloaded but we will need to decide upon pk and non pk.

If you would like to speak to me through msn then add me at : rockyrocks_2@hotmail.co.uk or PM me through the forums.

We do not allow people who are just in the team for the server, we all need a part in this team, therefore we will form together to form teams.
We will include the coding team, the bug team and everything like that.
We will also need to listen and be very patient for the server construction to happen, when the server is up and running i probably will not be hosting, my friend might be doing that.

Just to tell you i will be hosting hamachi whilst constructing, why do i do it hamachi? Because it is less lag and less lag is more time to construct for me, i will check my message box frequently for questions you might be asking.

We badly need your help to code because i feel useless alone, i cannot code like this, i am not very bad at coding as you might have downloaded my zammyscape source which even i thought was fun.
Want a part in the team? Just apply!

[b]Moparscape User name[/b]: [i] [/i]
[b]Coding Ability[/b]: [i] [/i] 
[b]Biggest project done[/b]: [i] [/i]
[b]Applying for the part in team[/b]: [i] [/i][/code]

[center][size=12pt][b]-=Forum Designers and Develepors[/b][/size]

For this part in the team you will be able to need to set up forums, develop the forums through out the weeks and maybe months, you will have to be active quite alot to check out for smf or ph2bb bugs, to be able to get this job you might have to be able to help through out coding in the tutorial sections if it is made by you.

[center][size=12pt][b]-=Server Designers and Develepors[/b][/size]

For this part in the team you need to be active through out the server, we will need this team quite alot because this is the coding team, to be able to join this team you need to be able to code, i will need you to be atleast a rating of 6\10 if you are atleast a 5\10 then you will be accepted rarely.
We need designers for this because of the thoughts for this.

You might see that there will not be alot of people not accepted because i have common sense and know someone good is gonna sign up and then say &quot;Oh i can&#39;t its full&quot; Lol but anyway not going off topic, i hope you join as i really need you!</description>

              <p>Well i have thought of to bring all those good coders all together to code a server, this server will also needed a cilent, codes, lots of members.<br>
We will need alot of coders for this server as it needs to be perfect, if you wish to join then you may tell us your abilities to code.<br>
If you are not that very good at coding and would like to join the i am very sorry, the server is not yet downloaded but we will need to decide upon pk and non pk.</p>
<p>If you would like to speak to me through msn then add me at : <a href="mailto:rockyrocks_2@hotmail.co.uk">rockyrocks_2@hotmail.co.uk</a> or PM me through the forums.</p>
<p>We do not allow people who are just in the team for the server, we all need a part in this team, therefore we will form together to form teams.<br>
We will include the coding team, the bug team and everything like that.<br>
We will also need to listen and be very patient for the server construction to happen, when the server is up and running i probably will not be hosting, my friend might be doing that.</p>
<p>Just to tell you i will be hosting hamachi whilst constructing, why do i do it hamachi? Because it is less lag and less lag is more time to construct for me, i will check my message box frequently for questions you might be asking.</p>
<p>We badly need your help to code because i feel useless alone, i cannot code like this, i am not very bad at coding as you might have downloaded my zammyscape source which even i thought was fun.<br>
Want a part in the team? Just apply!</p>
<p><code>
[b]Moparscape User name[/b]: [i] [/i]
[b]Coding Ability[/b]: [i] [/i] 
[b]Biggest project done[/b]: [i] [/i]
[b]Applying for the part in team[/b]: [i] [/i]</code></p>
<p>[center][size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">-=Forum Designers and Develepors</span>[/size]</p>
<p>For this part in the team you will be able to need to set up forums, develop the forums through out the weeks and maybe months, you will have to be active quite alot to check out for smf or ph2bb bugs, to be able to get this job you might have to be able to help through out coding in the tutorial sections if it is made by you.<br>

<p>[center][size=12pt]<span class="bbcode-b">-=Server Designers and Develepors</span>[/size]</p>
<p>For this part in the team you need to be active through out the server, we will need this team quite alot because this is the coding team, to be able to join this team you need to be able to code, i will need you to be atleast a rating of 6\10 if you are atleast a 5\10 then you will be accepted rarely.<br>
We need designers for this because of the thoughts for this.<br>

<p>You might see that there will not be alot of people not accepted because i have common sense and know someone good is gonna sign up and then say “Oh i can’t its full” Lol but anyway not going off topic, i hope you join as i really need you!</p>
