    <title>Changing Client Background Without Sprite Already There?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-client-background-without-sprite-already-there/358490</link>
    <description>I&#39;m kind of new at this, I was wondering how I would go about changing the background of the client.

It&#39;s a 317 Exion source, and it has the default runescape background. There are no sprites of any backgrounds previously created or anything, and I would really like to add my own.
Any help is appreciated.

ALSO: I would really like to add music to the client, it&#39;s just that my signlink.java doesn&#39;t look anything like the ones in the tutorials for this look like. But I&#39;ll worry about that later I guess</description>
