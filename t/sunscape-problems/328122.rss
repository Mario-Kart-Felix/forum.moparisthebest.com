    <description>Okey so I&#39;ve posted here http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,400718.msg3106954.html#msg3106954 which I thought was a good idea because that&#39;s where the thread for it is,well no one answered me,just kept asking for pictures AFTER I put them up(retards I know).So I also pmed the maker and he didn&#39;t reply.

The Problem:I cannot get any of the .exes to work and if you want pics,go to the site,it will be the first post you see,or if it is a trouble to anyone I&#39;ll put them in this thread.

Also I am running windows vista,x86 bit and quad core 2.4ghz and its AMD with nvidia graphics card.</description>
