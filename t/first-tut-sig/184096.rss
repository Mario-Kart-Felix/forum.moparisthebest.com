    <title>First TuT sig</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-tut-sig/184096</link>
    <description>Okay soo here is my first tutorial sig, It&#39;s from GIMP-tutorials, It&#39;s not great, I just wanted too get the feel of working it out;
[IMG]http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg92/GMAN7/new.png[/img]
As you can see it&#39;s a simplistic background, And colours are... well, not right ;) But it&#39;s just a start, I&#39;m making another one with this TuT, And I know for sure It&#39;ll be better, But just a starting point, K?



This one was from a Tutorial of which I don&#39;t not remember, But, It&#39;s simple and the text really bites. (Soo don&#39;t look at the text) :P

Im sorry i kind of blew up in my last post but its because i thought you where trying to say what i said was false. I wasnt directing any of the bad things towards you or any one else who posts here. I was just giving a generalisation of the people that post in the graphics section. Im sorry if you took it the wrong way m8.</p>
<p>I respect your oppinion and actually try to listen and follow it as best i can (when you do reply to my topics) Same with imortal which has given me an excelent idea on what i should do to my photomanip</p>

</aside>
<p>Don’t speak condescendingly to me. You don’t pull it off well when I can barely understand what you’re saying between the grammatical errors and incorrect spelling. It may have been nothing, but I took it as a personal insult. Mmk?  I wasn’t flaming you. I was defending myself, and my outward appearance. I never asked that you treat me the same as all mighty great and wonderful Exe. I was speaking to Javis for one thing, and not towards you. But by you saying that I don’t give good constructive criticism show you don’t know me. I’ve already said I put more effort into criticism than most people.</p>
<p>As for you Javis, I’m not full of my self, I have no need to ‘get over myself.’ I never said that you did not say I wasn’t one of the six. I was just correcting you. I may have misinterpreted what you posted. I believe at the time of my post I thought you were saying the other 5 people were full of themselves and think they’re the best.</p>
<p>I may have blown this way out of proportion, but a lot of what you were saying in that post characterizes me, for instance the ‘no higher than an 8.’</p>

</aside>
<p>Because Exe has a graphics award, and tells the truth when he rates image he becomes this object of obsession for all the newbies to ogle over? Bullshit, I am one of the ‘6’ people that casually post in here or a regular basis. Did I say I’m an amazing graphics artist? No, but could it be true? Maybe. I’m not full of myself, infact I look for every opportunity possible to better myself. That’s how I set myself apart, I strive for greatness, in every area of my life. And I sure as Hell don’t need some punk ass kid trying to ‘set me straight’.</p>
<p>If you’d like to know, I spend more time rating images in here than most other people here. I’ll use nator as an example, he gave a sentence for each image, littered with incorrect spellings and punctuations. All in all, his post was useless and has done nothing positive. Except add a post to his post count. Which is what quite a few people look for when they run through here posting.</p>
<p>You want to know why most of the 6 people that post in here give no more than 8’s (I don’t give more than 5’s)? It’s an  obvious reason. It’s because they don’t deserve it. “Ooh, they’re a nice person, I should go lenient on them.” Fuck that, if I were afraid to hurt someones feelings, I wouldn’t be so pissed off now. I rate images on a strict rubric I made myself. It works very well, and leaves the topic poster with something to go on. To improve themselves, which is why people should be posting their images, but in reality they post looking for people to commend them on their ‘amazing piece of art.’</p>
<p>I have post after post, after post. Of 4 or 5 paragraph long C&amp;C, sometimes with links to tutorials, others just a list of tutorials they should read. That doesn’t mean other can’t accomplish what I did with a few sentences, but I want the topic poster to feel like they really deserved the rating I gave them. I go into great detail of many aspects of images.</p>
<p>If I don’t give any C&amp;C it’s because I’m tired and I’ll repost later with an explanation of my rating. Or because it’s shit and doesn’t deserve a better explanation. Or if I see no room for improvement. I’m pretty much done with this. I have no reason to continue, I’ve said what has been needed to have been said. If you don’t believe me about my C&amp;C, I’ll list the topics, and you can ask FastBawlz.</p>
<p>Edit: Nator, my bad, it wasn’t ‘littered’ with incorrect spelling.[/quote]</p>
<p>And where did i say you wherent one of the six? you just asume. There really is only a few that ever come in here and we where talking about exe at the time. Im not saying that hes the only one we where just talking about him. Get over your self</p>

Try blur the background and sharpen the focal, it’s the noobiest and easiest thing you can do to bring out depth…<br>
Except you’re on GIMP, which I’ve never used, so get Photoshop and you can do way more, e.g. black to white gradient map on multiply = great depth.</p>

</aside>
<p>Hmmm the TuT is what I followed, No blur was in it…</p>
<p>As for the sig you “made” Omidsan…<br>
You did not make that, I did. I can post the link too it if you’d like? And the link too the RichScape forums topic, I gave you that sig, I didn’t think you would Rip me… Seemingly you are not trustworthy…[/quote]</p>
<p>I have a lot of time that I use for Richscape that i could use for Graphics. And I know i’ll be criticized along the way because no one’s perfect and you can only get better in life. You can’t ever be perfect.</p>
<p>And It was a Joke because there is no way you could ever make a sig like that in Paint. =]. So i thought that you would laugh but I guess not. Sorry.</p>
<p>I’m gonna go search for some TuT’s right now on google and try Gimp out but I really don’t even know how to start…</p>

Try blur the background and sharpen the focal, it’s the noobiest and easiest thing you can do to bring out depth…<br>

Hmmm the TuT is what I followed, No blur was in it…</p>
<p>As for the sig you “made” Omidsan…<br>
You did not make that, I did. I can post the link too it if you’d like? And the link too the RichScape forums topic, I gave you that sig, I didn’t think you would Rip me… Seemingly you are not trustworthy…</p>

<p>On a real note, im just saying that you are bassically one of about 6 people that even come to the graphics section. And most every one else who comes thinks they are the best at graphics and every one else deserves no higher than a 8 rating and half the time gives now C&amp;C at all</p>
