    <title>Handcannon and shot problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/handcannon-and-shot-problem/409093</link>
    <description>Ok so right now on my server when i try to use a hand cannon and the shot it says &quot;you can&#39;t use Handcannon shot with a hand cannon&quot;.
When i go to spawn in hand cannons and handcannon shot the id nubers are one higher then they are suposed to be. Like the acutal hand cannon is 15242 and the shot is 15244. I have tried to change it in my combat assistance file.... but it still says the same thing. :confused: Right now i think the problem section might be this part:
[size=8pt] if(c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == 15242 &amp;&amp; c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows] == 15242) {
c.sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t use &quot;+c.getItems().getItemName(c.playerEquipment[c.playerArrows]).toLowerCase()+&quot;s with a &quot;+c.getItems().getItemName(c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon]).toLowerCase()+&quot;.&quot;);
	c.stopMovement();
	c.npcIndex = 0;
	return;[/size][/size]				
}

This might not be the part but if anyone knows how to fix it or what is wrong with it please let me know . ;)</description>
