    <title>503 Client, thus far</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/503-client-thus-far/219782</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far, based on the deob release by Speljohan (which was partly refactored with Telenubby&#39;s help, iirc).

The client is attached. You just need to get the cache from the main directory that jagex places it on your computer when you load the game (ie, C:/WINDOWS/.jagex... or /.jagex.../ - whatever it is for your OS).</description>

              <p>I’ve identified a few server-to-client packets whilst playing RS, so I might as well post them here. It’s not much but ah, well:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">228 - Repeatedly received by client. According to the client updatePlayerLocations() is called.
40 - Repeatedly received by client. According to the client updateNPCLocations() is called.
30 - Received after three sets of the 228+40 packets.
17 - To do with logging out.
206 - To do with logging out.
253 - To do with logging out.
39 - Received when a message (non-player, more like server message) appeared in chatbox.
229 - Received after clicking on the Clan Chat Tab.
230 - Updates strings on interfaces? Received when prayer points dropped by one.
146 - To do with walking.
34 - To do with walking.
17 - Received when enabled/disabled run by clicking on RUN button. Same with ACCEPT AID. My guess is that it has to do with the given interface (highlight/non-highlight).</code></pre>
<p>P.S. Lothy, that just makes the entire code look like crap, imho. Don’t leave the original method, just assure it works first. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (You can include an entire class backup somewhere if you decide to post a release)</p>

<p>EDIT: If you’re going to more thoroughly deobfuscate it then try to leave the original method in place (as I have done with Stream methods in my version). This will, hopefully, ensure that nothing is broken (again). <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
