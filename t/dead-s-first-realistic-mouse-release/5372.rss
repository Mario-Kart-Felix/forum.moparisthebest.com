    <description>this is still in its infancy, but have a look. A description and instructions are on the script

(* Realistic mouse script by *DEAD*
Ok, this is my first mouse script worthy of releasing, and it looking really good.
Its a different type of mouse script design from all my others and most others
ive seen. It works by &quot;homing&quot; in on a target, which means you can &quot;bump&quot; the mouse
randandomly change its direction, and it would correct itself, much like a real person would.

There are lots of required varables, so ill go through them.

tomouse(targx, targy, speed, square, accuracy, turnspeed :integer finishingtouch :integer);
targx and targy are the x,y coords of the point the mouse is to move to.
speed is the speed at which the mouse moves
Think of square as the randomness of each small mouse movement. Each time the script is given a coordanate to move to, the mouse moves to a coordanate close to that point which is inside a square.
accuracy is how close the cursor has to be to the target before it stops
turnspeed is how fast the mouse can change direction. This is actually a percentage (0 - 100) of the difference between the target angle and the current angle (i recomend 20 - 25) (known glitch, sometimes it will just keep circling around the target, im working on it)
finishingtouch will move the mouse to the target after the main move mouse script stops. With out this, the mouse could stop within &quot;accuracy&quot; pixels from the target
there is one more varable, curangle. This is a global, but when i release the actual script it will be fixed. Curangle is the angle at which the mouse is traveling at any given time. If you change its start value, the mouse will start moving in a different direction. Remember, since on a computer screen the y axis is at the top of the screen and counts up as it goes down, the circle will be inverted. so 90 is downward, 270 is upward, 0 is right, and 180 is left.


The best thing about this script is that its easy to add on to.
Ive included a &quot;bump&quot; procedure which randomly change the mouses direction,
and the the mouse will correct itself all by itself. cool eh. This means
you can do anything from making a quick jolt, to emulating the mouse falling
off the desk.

Enjoy

              <p>thanks for the suggestion, im not gonna work on it any more today, but i do agree, it will probally be tedious to settle out all those little details. I also see i have a few mr squigles to sort out, lol.[br][size=1]Posted at: July 19, 2006, 02:57:05 PM[/size][hr]almost done. Ive improved on the bug where it would occasionally cirlcle the target repetitively, but its not quite there, it still does it rarely. Im also gonna make it curve a bit more by adding a “gravity” point which the cursor will be attracted to as it passes. heres the script for anyone who wants to have a look, and ill save cheese the job of posting a picture of it</p>

<p>[br][size=1]Posted at: July 20, 2006, 05:26:09 AM[/size][hr]ive completed my mouse !!!. In my oppinion, its fantastic. It did take about 400 lines of code, but its as realistic as anything. Ill be posting the script in the runescape scripts section and the useful procedures for srl. Btw, the mouse is independant of any includes, so it will work with anything. (this was one of my original goals). I dont think anyone using my mouse will be banned for mouse movements alone. Remember to include off action mouse movements as well. I think there are some bored human functions lying around.</p>

              <p>progress report, a few glitches fixed, and added acceleration control. Still needs work, but its getting there. Now i just want to make it curve (rather than just rotate until it finds the target and then move in a strait line), which i dont thing will be too too hard. I also want to make it look a bit smoother, but honestly i dont think this matters because rs will only see where the mouse is every so often, not the “smoothness” of a curve that a human would see. Finally, im gonna find a way to make the deceleration decelerate in such a way that it reaches the min speed just as it reaches the target. In short, right now i think i have a script that is almost unbannable, to be banned using it you would have to be caught for something else, such as cyclilic actions and what not. enjoy, but remember, its not done yet, it might have a glitch or two, and if it stuffs up, im not gonna let u blame me. I cant really post a paint drawing showing acceleration, so heres the code as is.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(* Realistic mouse script by *DEAD*
Ok, this is my first mouse script worthy of releasing, and it looking really good.
Its a different type of mouse script design from all my others and most others
ive seen. It works by "homing" in on a target, which means you can "bump" the mouse
randandomly change its direction, and it would correct itself, much like a real person would.

There are lots of required varables, so ill go through them.

tomouse(targx,targy,maxspeed,minspeed,square,accuracy,turnspeed,acceleration,deceleration:integer; finishingtouch:boolean);
targx and targy are the x,y coords of the point the mouse is to move to.
maxspeed is the speed at which the mouse accelerates to.
minspeed is the minimum speed of the mouse, with out it the mouse would stop (i intend to find a work around which will fix this).
Think of square as the randomness of each small mouse movement. Each time the script is given a coordanate to move to, the mouse moves to a coordanate close to that point which is inside a square.
accuracy is how close the cursor has to be to the target before it stops
turnspeed is how fast the mouse can change direction. This is actually a percentage (0 - 100) of the difference between the target angle and the current angle (i recomend 20 - 25) (known glitch, sometimes it will just keep circling around the target, im working on it)
acceleration is the rate at which the mouse accelerates(%)
deceleration is the rate at which the mouse decelerates(%)

finishingtouch will move the mouse to the target after the main move mouse script stops. With out this, the mouse could stop within "accuracy" pixels from the target
there is one more varable, curangle. This is a global, but when i release the actual script it will be fixed. Curangle is the angle at which the mouse is traveling at any given time. If you change its start value, the mouse will start moving in a different direction. Remember, since on a computer screen the y axis is at the top of the screen and counts up as it goes down, the circle will be inverted. so 90 is downward, 270 is upward, 0 is right, and 180 is left.


The best thing about this script is that its easy to add on to.
Ive included a "bump" procedure which randomly change the mouses direction,
and the the mouse will correct itself all by itself. cool eh. This means
you can do anything from making a quick jolt, to emulating the mouse falling
off the desk.

Enjoy

              <p>its still a baby, but if you change turnspeed, you should get a different curve. Now, did you start the mouse at the top both times, or is the second one going from the bottom to the top. It is kinda tricky to get a random curve using my method, because i told the mouse how to find a way, not a way, but im working on it.</p>

<p>Your mosue is pretty good, except it follows the same curve rotation like every time. Maybe sometimes it will curve the other way, or onyl curve once? Because it usually curves twice.</p>

              <p>this is still in its infancy, but have a look. A description and instructions are on the script</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(* Realistic mouse script by *DEAD*
Ok, this is my first mouse script worthy of releasing, and it looking really good.
Its a different type of mouse script design from all my others and most others
ive seen. It works by "homing" in on a target, which means you can "bump" the mouse
randandomly change its direction, and it would correct itself, much like a real person would.

There are lots of required varables, so ill go through them.

tomouse(targx, targy, speed, square, accuracy, turnspeed :integer finishingtouch :integer);
targx and targy are the x,y coords of the point the mouse is to move to.
speed is the speed at which the mouse moves
Think of square as the randomness of each small mouse movement. Each time the script is given a coordanate to move to, the mouse moves to a coordanate close to that point which is inside a square.
accuracy is how close the cursor has to be to the target before it stops
turnspeed is how fast the mouse can change direction. This is actually a percentage (0 - 100) of the difference between the target angle and the current angle (i recomend 20 - 25) (known glitch, sometimes it will just keep circling around the target, im working on it)
finishingtouch will move the mouse to the target after the main move mouse script stops. With out this, the mouse could stop within "accuracy" pixels from the target
there is one more varable, curangle. This is a global, but when i release the actual script it will be fixed. Curangle is the angle at which the mouse is traveling at any given time. If you change its start value, the mouse will start moving in a different direction. Remember, since on a computer screen the y axis is at the top of the screen and counts up as it goes down, the circle will be inverted. so 90 is downward, 270 is upward, 0 is right, and 180 is left.


The best thing about this script is that its easy to add on to.
Ive included a "bump" procedure which randomly change the mouses direction,
and the the mouse will correct itself all by itself. cool eh. This means
you can do anything from making a quick jolt, to emulating the mouse falling
off the desk.

Enjoy
