    <description>
Ok guys, so my game is almost finished and it is pretty serious because I made an Iphone, Blackberry, Android and PC version of it. 
Basicly, yesturday I made a song for the game as the main BGM. Each level is 3 minutes so I made it fit the levels.
I asked my friend (brother from another mother (and father)) what he thought of it and he said that one song of a couple of songs I made for fun last year would match the gamePLAY better.


And to be honest, it does match the gameplay, and so does that song I made for the game.


So now I&#39;m confused, and that is why I am here.


Basicly, It&#39;s a shoot&#39;em up game (in first person) under water. That&#39;s all you need to know.


www.vreg.comli.com ------&gt; there are 2 songs in there, one that&#39;s called DJ Vreg - A Second Chance and the song intented for the game.


Now if you listend to both of those songs and told me wich one was better to match as BGM for a shoot&#39;em up game under water, then I&#39;d be really HAPPY.


Extra info: The song that was ment for the game still needs some tweeks.


That other song needs a lot of tweeks, for example it needs to be in 3 minutes and all the shit in the beginning has to go and stuff like that so when listening to the second be sure to keep in mind that the song you will hear in game will be somewhere in the middle of that song and not the beginning extra shit.


THANK YOU!</description>

I agree with Loveandpower, the 2nd one would definitely fit this kind of game better than the 1st one.<br>
[/quote]So you thought it sounded like porn music as well? o.0[/quote]I understand that the sexyness of the song makes you think about porno.</p>
