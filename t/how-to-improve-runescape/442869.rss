    <title>How to improve Runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-improve-runescape/442869</link>
    <description>Before you post about how there is nothing to improve in Runescape; I beg to differ. Currently there are 128k active accounts playing right now (at 9:43 EST). Obviously players care about the game, and without it these forums would have never been around.

Now my question to you is, without complaining, how do you think Runescape as a game can be improved? 

• Graphics are out of the question, with a web-browser best game it&#39;s harder to implement from what I understand. 
• The company is only there to make money, not care as a whole about the community, so SoF removal is out of the question.
• The economy would never become fixed by Jagex, as the community is [i]way[/i] to dependent on the Grand Exchange.
• Knowing that the rework of Combat has been started, I think this is personally a great change to balance the combat triangle and rework how the game is played.

I’d like to see some opinions on reworking different mechanisms of the game; combat for example is a great thing to be reworked, but what other skills/aspects of the games could be reworked and would be a success?<br>
[/quote]<br>
On the idea of reworking skills it seems like they already are and if I recall correctly from a video by RuneZone I believe they’re planning on doing it for more skills. Reworking runecafting with runespan for example was a great idea. But in the video they brought up agility and mod mark said he’d like to make it less ‘clicky’. They mentioned they’d like to make skills more sociable which would mean making them more afk than grind. I’ll try to find the video but I think making skills less of a grind makes them more enjoyable and that Jagex has the right idea with reworking combat. To me it seems that you can afk combat more than you can skills and I’d like to see that reversed with this combat rework.</p>

<p>EDIT: By afk I mean what mod mark says in the video as less click intensive.[/quote]They’re doing a great job in reworking the skills. An example was Runecrafting, I used to say to myself “this skill will be the last one ill be getting 99 at” and the only skills left for me to max were the hardcore grind ones and I was about to stop playing but they won themselves $5 again :o . Looking forward to the agility rework.</p>

You wont need to relearn anything, just like other games you will still be able to click on the action bar or use the mouse in the same way you did before. If you say you dont want to use it, you may even be able to turn it off (I dont know), you are at a disadvantage, sure, but no more than you are now if you dont use mousekeys or whatever.</p>

I just don’t like it, I like Rs for the main reason of its simplicity. I don’t like all these new armours, potions and so forth but I put up with it and use it. Like I get the things, learn how to do things i…e. I dislike like using hotkeys but I liked the simple mouse orientated game…:. Dunno if I could put up with the action bar, not use it and be at an disadvantage or use it and eventually get used to it.<br>
I hope they don’t add it in, it’ll be like learning the game all over again.</p>

<p>Get rid of the “SOF”, lower memberships, continue their fight against bots. Make these items that have been massively botted/introduced into the game have a real purpose again. J-Mods should interact with the players more often, fairly rare to see one hanging out. Less multi-player mini-games. Less combat based mini-games. More inspiration to skill, no more “Bonus XP weekend”. More incentives to get 99.</p>

Really just stop with the graphical updates.  I like the whole HD type thing, but my computer and my internet can’t stand the newer graphic style.  Just like my friend who plays loves to play rs, but get really low frames and connection issues due to graphics and the anti-bot shit that only increased the lagg.<br>

<p>That’s confusing. Graphical quality does affect graphics lag, but does not affect network lag. :S</p>

<p>They fixed the FPS issue and there is no lag issue so the problem is on his part. I get 35 fps on the highest detail fullscreen etc assuming its not like w2 g.e.</p>

If it aint’ broke, don’t fix it. Jagex may use ideas common in MMO’s (but fuck off saying WoW created them all), but if anything it’s going to improve the game. Anyone that watched the behind the scenes video on the action bar will realize this is a fucking amazing update, it can be used to skill, or do almost anything in the game, not just combat (examples the mods gave were having action buttons set to light fires, eat, etc). Sure, lots of MMO’s have action bars, but this is DEFINITELY going to improve RuneScape immensely.</p>
<p>Not sure what you mean by medieval though, there’s only so much you can add period based before you just run out of content (which is why RuneScape has always been a fantasy game, even though they started out with the basics of normal armor and such)<br>
