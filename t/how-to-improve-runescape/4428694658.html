<li>If <span class="hashtag">#1</span> is done, the average levels will have dropped immensely. Then stop adding continuously top-tier gear to appeal to people that bot all their stats/gold.

<li>Remove the click intensive grind. They are doing this well already with firemaking, runecrafting, and I hope they can do it to the rest of the stats as well. Especially the older more popular skills like fishing and cooking. I’d love to see a cooking update personally. The majority of eaten food is fish, because botters fish the fish and then botters cook the fish, allowing for the mass production and low prices.

<li>MORE QUESTSSSS, expand on the ftp quest series, and other lower level ones. I love quests, and love quest specific items.</li>
<li>More interesting combat. From what I’ve heard the combat update is about an action bar, which is more than just for combat, but hopefully they expand on the idea as well.</li>

<li>Rework the world system. The times have just outgrown tile based in my opinion.</li>
<li>Allow people to redo old events when the time comes again, if they were registered at the time. (so say you registered in 2001, but you were away for the christmas event in 2007, you could redo the 2007 christmas event for the reward whenever the next christmas came (2012 or whatever).

You mentioned graphics: personally I think a way of improving the game would be to <span class="bbcode-i">downgrade</span> them. The models and animations that go with them, usually the players and NPCs, are awful. Ugly.</p>
<p>When a player is standing still, why is he swaying like a complete idiot? Who the hell thought that was a good idea. Doesn’t make sense.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yeah, I miss when the idle animation was bopping up and down :([/quote]<br>
the statue stand was better</p>

        <p>Bring the game together, the older content doesn’t match the newer content. I believe that combat is being reworked which is good as older npcs are underpowered in comparison to new armours etc i.e. jad v gano = no skill and jad was once consider leetcake status;o.<br>
Better customer service. Gf bots and autotalkers… Stop making 99s so fast now, I know the fast xp is good and we all love it but its degrading the game. Rework dungeoneering possibly so solo play is nearly as good as teams… so many crap dungers…<br>
Have a lot more armours and weapons with slight variances but dif requirements etc. Make skilling more appealing and add more things to do in rs combat wise. i.e. something similar to frost dragons same reqs or w.e. but just different so your not constantly doing the same thing again and again.<br>
Maybe start taking Rs away from browser, like yeah keep the browser game up but maybe have like an expansion pack or something… Rs has a lot of limits due to it being a browser game.<br>
Possibly, very possibly if they do all of that a reset assuming they can gf bots as the economy is fucked, far too many high levels etc but the rares would get gfed &lt;/3…</p>
<p>Also, when dupes and big bugs occur for them to temporarily take the game down till it is fixed rather than gf the economy…</p>

<p>If runescape wanted to look like crysis im sure they could, but theyd lose probably 90% of the playerbase for the same reasons RIFT did. Theyd also have to hire new artists that havent been brain washed to model like chinese slave children.</p>

I don’t ignore it, I ignore your posts half of the time that’s why I didn’t see it. Well you learn something new everyday, I didn’t sit here and think about the logic behind it because honestly I don’t really care but yeah your correct I just went with what I was told which is a <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> common thing people do.<br>
You know if you felt like the typing was that much effort you just could have quoted it, nah you clearly overused that one brain cell of yours. I’m kidding, I know you know your stuff but rudeness isn’t nice is it?<br>
Anyways, you are correct argument over.</p>

I have a few things, just from my experience. I’m not saying that these are even possible, just what I think needs to be done.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the bots. Remove stats and gold that were botted. Simple, but probably impossible.</li>
<li>If <span class="hashtag">#1</span> is done, the average levels will have dropped immensely. Then stop adding continuously top-tier gear to appeal to people that bot all their stats/gold. Work more on mid level and low level content, with extentions into higher levels (like the new dungeon that came out with the quest, with the three levels. I like it, but it’s very bland. If that was a more interesting area it would be perfect)</li>
<li>Remove the click intensive grind. They are doing this well already with firemaking, runecrafting, and I hope they can do it to the rest of the stats as well. Especially the older more popular skills like fishing and cooking. I’d love to see a cooking update personally. The majority of eaten food is fish, because botters fish the fish and then botters cook the fish, allowing for the mass production and low prices. I think people having more incentives to make their own food would be great. Add ‘top tier’ foods, that heal massive numbers of lifepoints (cant be used in PvP, or some other limitation) but are complex recipes.</li>
<li>MORE QUESTSSSS, expand on the ftp quest series, and other lower level ones. I love quests, and love quest specific items.</li>
<li>More interesting combat. From what I’ve heard the combat update is about an action bar, which is more than just for combat, but hopefully they expand on the idea as well.</li>
<li>Ban everyone that complains about the graphi- oh wait that one was meant for MoparScape <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
<li>Rework the world system. The times have just outgrown tile based in my opinion.</li>
<li>Allow people to redo old events when the time comes again, if they were registered at the time. (so say you registered in 2001, but you were away for the christmas event in 2007, you could redo the 2007 christmas event for the reward whenever the next christmas came (2012 or whatever). Personally I want this one, because I missed the scarves <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> But it’s not really realistic haha.</li>
</ol>
<p>Few more I’ll think of later…<br>
[/quote]I approve of most of these as well. I also want holiday items tradeable again![/quote]<br>
This is pretty much what I would do to improve the game.  Especially the grind.  Imo, the grind is the number one problem this game has.  It’s the reason I quit (and started botting), and I’m sure the reason that many other people did the same.  If the game wasn’t horribly repetitive, I actually would play it.  Especially the low levels… When a skill is a low level, training is the most god awful thing… I don’t see how people actually manage to get their stats up high enough for the game to be fun (pking, high level minigames, high level quests).</p>

<p>You mentioned graphics: personally I think a way of improving the game would be to <span class="bbcode-i">downgrade</span> them. The models and animations that go with them, usually the players and NPCs, are awful. Ugly.</p>
<p>When a player is standing still, why is he swaying like a complete idiot? Who the hell thought that was a good idea. Doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>Yeah, I miss when the idle animation was bopping up and down <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

shut up noob u dont know what u talk about</p>
<p>Its all about the nice, non computer stressing animations :3</p>
<p>I miss them because they were so easy to run on just about any computer… and were so simple to understand what they’re doing…<br>
And tbh they look a lot cooler than today’s graphics.</p>

<p>I have a few things, just from my experience. I’m not saying that these are even possible, just what I think needs to be done.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the bots. Remove stats and gold that were botted. Simple, but probably impossible.</li>
<li>If <span class="hashtag">#1</span> is done, the average levels will have dropped immensely. Then stop adding continuously top-tier gear to appeal to people that bot all their stats/gold. Work more on mid level and low level content, with extentions into higher levels (like the new dungeon that came out with the quest, with the three levels. I like it, but it’s very bland. If that was a more interesting area it would be perfect)</li>
<li>Remove the click intensive grind. They are doing this well already with firemaking, runecrafting, and I hope they can do it to the rest of the stats as well. Especially the older more popular skills like fishing and cooking. I’d love to see a cooking update personally. The majority of eaten food is fish, because botters fish the fish and then botters cook the fish, allowing for the mass production and low prices. I think people having more incentives to make their own food would be great. Add ‘top tier’ foods, that heal massive numbers of lifepoints (cant be used in PvP, or some other limitation) but are complex recipes.</li>
<li>MORE QUESTSSSS, expand on the ftp quest series, and other lower level ones. I love quests, and love quest specific items.</li>
<li>More interesting combat. From what I’ve heard the combat update is about an action bar, which is more than just for combat, but hopefully they expand on the idea as well.</li>
<li>Ban everyone that complains about the graphi- oh wait that one was meant for MoparScape <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</li>
<li>Rework the world system. The times have just outgrown tile based in my opinion.</li>
<li>Allow people to redo old events when the time comes again, if they were registered at the time. (so say you registered in 2001, but you were away for the christmas event in 2007, you could redo the 2007 christmas event for the reward whenever the next christmas came (2012 or whatever).

I do like how lots of time is required to max many skills though, otherwise the game would get top-heavy far too quickly. Even with skills being as easy as some (Runecrafting), most people aren’t getting 99 simply because of the time it takes, and as such it has a good balance between grind and time investment.</p>
