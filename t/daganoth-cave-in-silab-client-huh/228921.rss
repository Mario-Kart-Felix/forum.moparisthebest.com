              <p>You have to change the ids/ints W-E its called in the client and add that itemsid in order to see/use the recolored item, all clients can white screen due to having corrupted models such as ‘custom servers’ with their ‘custom client’ and people have problems with it since they never heard the word java, classpaths, or a url as they dont wan’t to learn SHIT.</p>
