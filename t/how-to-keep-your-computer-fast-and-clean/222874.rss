    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-keep-your-computer-fast-and-clean/222874</link>
    <description>First of all this will be a guide to people who just got a new computer and suck at keeping it clean and working brand new computer.

[u][b]Anti viruses[/b][/u]
[u][b]Recommended:[/b] - [b]Free[/b][/u]
Avg Anti-virus - http://free.avg.com/ww.download?prd=afe
Avast Anti-virus - http://anti-virus-solution.com/avast2/index_p2.asp
Mc-Afee Anti-virus - http://www.softpedia.com/get/Antivirus/McAfee-VirusScan.shtml

- All are free except McAfee, it&#39;s a very good Anti-Virus. The trial is worth it.

[u][b]Anti viruses[/b][/u]
[u][b]Recommended:[/b] - [b]To buy[/b][/u]
McAfee Anti-virus - http://download.mcafee.com/eval/evaluate2.asp
Kaspersy Anti-virus - http://usa.kaspersky.com/newversion7/?aw=kaspersky&amp;CMP=KNC-DJ2899729106&amp;HBX_PK=kaspersky&amp;HBX_OU=50 (Has a trial if you want to test first)

Thats the only one I recommend you buy. If you want to buy it. The free ones are still very good.

[u][b]Anti viruses[/b][/u]
[u][b]Recommended[/b] - [b]What not to use[/b][/u]
Norton Anti-Virus - Do not use this. If it says, &quot;We have found over 70viruses in your computer&quot; as a free scan run to make you buy it, well don&#39;t. It isn&#39;t true. This goes for all current versions.

[u][b]Now, your virus scanner may be good. But it may not be the best.[/b][/u]
This website will help you alot in the future. Before you download a [b].rar/.zip/.exe[/b] file make sure to scan it at www.virusscan.jotti.org. They have all the best free scanners and theres over 10. This will help insure your computer safety. Make sure to scan it with your anti-virus also.

[u][b]Programs that will help clean your computer[/b][/u]
CCleaner - www.CCleaner.com (Will clean out crap on your computer and other files)
Control panel - This is on your computer. If you download something and don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t just delete it through the recycle bin and not delete through your cp. It&#39;s just a matter of fact of being lasy. 

[u][b]How to fix your computer if attacked by a virus or something screws windows and you can&#39;t re-install.[/b][/u] 
Ok. Some computers have a system restore feature to the very first day before you boot onto your computer. Click on f12 or what ever your computer has and restore to the first day. If you are able to get to your pc then do system restore manually do it to a day before you installed this virus. Another option, you have the abillity to make recovery disks if anything happens to windows. Well make them. It should take like 2 D.V.D disks. Then if you fuck windows, you can reinstall it by booting and inserting the disks.

[u][b]What not to do[/b][/u]
Installing - Do not go around installing random shit especially when it&#39;s supposed to be &#39;safe&#39;. Scan it.
Games - Don&#39;t install to many games, they can slow down your computer.
Upgrading/updating - Don&#39;t update to windows vista (any version) and if you have it, don&#39;t get any un-important updates to it.

[u][b]What to run on your computer[/b][/u]
You shouldn&#39;t run windows vista or any windows as a matter of fact. Use linux. You can go check out Rons guide to dual booting ubuntu. If you must run windows use Windows xp professional or Windows xp media center edition.

[u][b]What kind of computer you want[/b][/u]
If you want a home computer get a computer with Win xp professional including 1-2gigs of ram and an ok video card. A video-game computer you would need 2gigs of ram, Amd athlon procceser 6400+, Nvidia Geforce 8800 graphics card (recommended). DivX 9.0+

[u][b]What kind of browser you need[/b][/u]
Mozilla firefox - http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/   (Both are much better then IE)
Opera - http://www.opera.com/

[u][b]What to have on your pc[/b][/u]
CCleaner
Windows xp professional
Microsoft office word 2003
Avg or Avast ant-virus
Mozzila firefox
Thunder bird email

Thanks for your time and I hope you can use this guide to keep your computer safe.</description>

              <p>What do you recommend for a browser.  I mean I have been using firefox since the start of 2.0, but I heard the new Opera is currently destroying Firefox3.</p>

<ul>
<li>All are free except McAfee, it’s a very good Anti-Virus. The trial is worth it.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Anti viruses</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Recommended:</span> - <span class="bbcode-b">To buy</span></span><br>

<p>Thats the only one I recommend you buy. If you want to buy it. The free ones are still very good.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Anti viruses</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Recommended</span> - <span class="bbcode-b">What not to use</span></span><br>
Norton Anti-Virus - Do not use this. If it says, “We have found over 70viruses in your computer” as a free scan run to make you buy it, well don’t. It isn’t true. This goes for all current versions.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Now, your virus scanner may be good. But it may not be the best.</span></span><br>
This website will help you alot in the future. Before you download a <span class="bbcode-b">.rar/.zip/.exe</span> file make sure to scan it at <a href="http://www.virusscan.jotti.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.virusscan.jotti.org</a>. They have all the best free scanners and theres over 10. This will help insure your computer safety. Make sure to scan it with your anti-virus also.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Programs that will help clean your computer</span></span><br>
CCleaner - <a href="http://www.CCleaner.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.CCleaner.com</a> (Will clean out crap on your computer and other files)<br>
Control panel - This is on your computer. If you download something and don’t like it, don’t just delete it through the recycle bin and not delete through your cp. It’s just a matter of fact of being lasy.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">How to fix your computer if attacked by a virus or something screws windows and you can’t re-install.</span></span><br>
Ok. Some computers have a system restore feature to the very first day before you boot onto your computer. Click on f12 or what ever your computer has and restore to the first day. If you are able to get to your pc then do system restore manually do it to a day before you installed this virus. Another option, you have the abillity to make recovery disks if anything happens to windows. Well make them. It should take like 2 D.V.D disks. Then if you fuck windows, you can reinstall it by booting and inserting the disks.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">What not to do</span></span><br>
Installing - Do not go around installing random shit especially when it’s supposed to be ‘safe’. Scan it.<br>
Games - Don’t install to many games, they can slow down your computer.<br>
Upgrading/updating - Don’t update to windows vista (any version) and if you have it, don’t get any un-important updates to it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">What to run on your computer</span></span><br>
You shouldn’t run windows vista or any windows as a matter of fact. Use linux. You can go check out Rons guide to dual booting ubuntu. If you must run windows use Windows xp professional or Windows xp media center edition.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">What kind of computer you want</span></span><br>
If you want a home computer get a computer with Win xp professional including 1-2gigs of ram and an ok video card. A video-game computer you would need 2gigs of ram, Amd athlon procceser 6400+, Nvidia Geforce 8800 graphics card (recommended). DivX 9.0+</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">What kind of browser you need</span></span><br>
Mozilla firefox - <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/</a>   (Both are much better then IE)<br>
Opera - <a href="http://www.opera.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.opera.com/</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">What to have on your pc</span></span><br>
CCleaner<br>
Windows xp professional<br>
Microsoft office word 2003<br>
Avg or Avast ant-virus<br>
Mozzila firefox<br>
Thunder bird email</p>
