    <title>[URGENT]Customs On A Webclient[URGENT]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/urgent-customs-on-a-webclient-urgent/374284</link>
    <description>Hey, i&#39;m the owner of FrostyScape and very recently my friend made me a Webclient for $10, the point is that my 20 or so customs appear as nulls, now he told me that they have to be loaded through the cache or something, but I don&#39;t know how as he made the Webclient. He did say he would help but he can be very lazy, and it could be months by the time he wants to help me.

So basically I need someone to fix my Webclient so that the customs appear as my server&#39;s economy, pretty much runs on those customs.

I guess I could pay $5 - $10, just my server is fairly new and we tend to have an average of 10-15 players on at all times, and the Webclient will help me get more players and more donations meaning I could pay you, unless of course, you are extremely nice and would do it for free? :)

P.S Sorry for advertisement as this isn&#39;t the correct section, but if you are curious, you can check out my forums @ [url=http://www.FrostyScape.net]FrostyScape[/url]

There are only a few members as they are new forums and most of my members (200+) still use the old free forums @ [url=http://www.frostyscape.omgforum.net]Free forum : FrostyScape[/url] , I am in the middle of transferring them all over to the new forums.

Please don&#39;t flame me for that small section of advertisement, and focus you&#39;re attention on the situation above ;)

PLEASE and THANK YOU</description>

<p>If you have this thing most humans do, called a brain, you would search “how to make a webclient”</p>
<p>After finding a tutorial for that, you would look for something talking about the cache, would you not?</p>
