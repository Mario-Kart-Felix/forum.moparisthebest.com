    <title>Proper way of defining Npc combat behaviors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/proper-way-of-defining-npc-combat-behaviors/401598</link>
    <description>I am having trouble defining how an Npc should behave while in combat. I want to avoid explicitly defining the behavior for each Npc. For a better understanding, let me show you a diagram of my current implementation:

(note: First time using a UML editor. I omitted some unimportant details (npc level, current health, etc))

As you can see, the Npc class implements method [i]attack(Entity target)[/i] from Entity. However, all Npcs don&#39;t attack the same way. For example, a Goblin only attacks with melee, while Jad uses Magic, Ranged, and Melee depending on the conditions of the fight.

One solution that crossed my mind was possibly using a scripting language to define the behaviors. However, this was quickly disregarded when thinking about the implementation.</description>
