In the first image I would like to show you guys is where our home is located &amp; our Teleport Hub which you can use to teleport around, everything goes down here pretty much!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/499b49612302b2c4542751c272acfc32.png[/img]

In the next picture you can see our duel arena which works perfectly, and in this image you can see &quot;The Spoils&quot; from a stake!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/e1c82d14d0ce20b9d958e3cf989d6e62.png[/img]

In this image, I show you another way of teleporting around, you&#39;ll need this especially if your looking to go down to Glacors and pick up yourself some Steads!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/9bcf0481833136532b7ccfd7de43c93d.png[/img]

Talking about Glacors! Here they are, working 100% like runescape, Double HP bars Minions and weak to Fire Spells!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/0e2ad324696170cfcc86e9dd70af3c7d.png[/img]

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/cf599facdeee8325868a5960ade4060b.png[/img]

Whats this we have? A fun minigame Pest Control working fabulously and users enjoy playing it, saving up for that void armour! Heres a few images of it!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/e738439944463b392eba0b414e53a83a.png[/img]

You into bossing? Find it pretty much easy as hell to go boss, what we have choose to do is use the way Runescape do it and make you have to kill 25 Minions before entering past the door to slay Bandos etc!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/762829f9585504e5ad9c4399c8e473de.png[/img]

Currently on BoomScape we have the Construction system of making planks, done much better than most servers but still something we will be working on to upgrade heres a few images!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/f3afdd9912bd55be2944eab6f43c97af.png[/img]

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/b94bb30187782a233550fb094805f0d7.png[/img]

Dungeoneering find it boring and very easy on most servers? Not on BoomScape, our Dung system requires you to go through a series of waves to kill all different NPC&#39;s like Jad, Nomad and much more but don&#39;t worry they don&#39;t come at you until you get onto higher waves!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/df2fc353e7d3cc350330f6640c8b0e02.png[/img]

Completionist Cape Rewards, we have decided not to make them to easy, they have been made like this to keep you guys entertained and work hard towards your goal of getting Comp!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/abd881e01fe01971f34e45fbae578a98.png[/img]

Don&#39;t worry we didn&#39;t forget Completionist Cape Trimmed! To acquire this cape your going to have to do a little more!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/cd4e48d196423a6512bc910938408e44.png[/img]

Donator boxes, what these will do is give you a chance of getting Rare items and Rusty coins, Rusty coins are a currency which allow you to buy Donator, Extreme Donator &amp; VIP ranks from the shop!

Character Customisation! We have long waited fixing this one up, we now have it working just like Runescape, when you login you will be able to style up your character and look cool without armour!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/8f8314b2ef2186be63a0f500b83c2dfc.png[/img]

Even though on BoomScape all Nulls have been fixed, instead of making Mules, we have a Token System currency which are worth 100m each and can be traded around to buy stuff :)

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/11b1179d3f29e6d73be7f1f1417b95a9.png[/img]

Pyramid Plunder minigame, perfect for you thief&#39;s out there! Play this minigame to level up in Thieving!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/1fb3552d27502ae787d9c5839344f586.png[/img]

On BoomScape the Dominion Tower is a great place to get the best gloves on the game! After getting a certain amount of Dominion Factor points you can go and purchase your long waited gloves!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/63c99dbe07e31af0aa493a4125cf31f3.png[/img]

Pvm Points, on most slayer tasks, when killing the NPC&#39;s you will notice you get Pvm points, these are great for earning rewards in the stores!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/a59d934c0e4820d2e3cb46af7b824575.png[/img]

No longer need to have cash in your inventory to Buy &amp; Sell items they go straight from your Money Pouch, Buying &amp; Selling, you still can buy from using Coins in your inventory though!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/5e3a481c4c05f9bd5ae72ee766009a87.png[/img]

Dragonfire shield working just like Runescape &amp; Cools down like Runescape, giving you the ultimate Shield as you can see below!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/e3aadb70b68180cb2ce1529c40a0db3f.png[/img]
[IMG]http://gyazo.com/68816cb4598772aa52eb7bde473094ac.png[/img]

Bank Pins, speak to a banker to get one of these, we are still working on making it so you can use the interface for Bank Pins though!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/bef3eb4d652274868c703afd52cc39ff.png[/img]

Correct Stats Checker in Shops, Select Item Click Stats to see!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/bde36997ce7aaf6bf36a5ef490cc526b.png[/img]

Gambling! At BoomScape we have a great Gambling Community, we allow Extreme Donators + Plant Mithril Seeds &amp; After 150 Votes you can buy a Dice Bag!!

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/b6a58605bcfae819263ef9fe6721b868.png[/img]

&amp; Here you can see you can&#39;t plant ontop of another flower ;)

[IMG]http://gyazo.com/189c098d99c8d2e780b9fd83168ff989.png[/img]

Currently that&#39;s all we have got to show you, we will be back here to update the thread add more images and include much more infortmation about BoomScape, be sure to get this server link around to your friends and family who Play RSPS&#39;s or even RuneScape!
