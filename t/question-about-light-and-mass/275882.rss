    <description>ok, there have been arguments that light does have and does not have mass, but if you think practically light reflects and only something that has mass can be reflected by another object, i am not so sure on this..can any one give their thoughts on this.. and if you want to spam and say something that is not use full please find some other place. thank you</description>

              <p>it seems Newtonian perspective of light provides much better solution to the problem of light having mass…yet the electro magnetic theory of light is rather confusing and to me it does not make sense…yet i might not understand the full aspects of the theory…so far i have scratched the mere surface of the quantum world.</p>
