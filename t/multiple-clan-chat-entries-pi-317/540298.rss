    <title>Multiple clan chat entries? PI 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multiple-clan-chat-entries-pi-317/540298</link>
    <description>Sometimes there will be multiple instances of the same player in the clan chat, but a sort of nulled version. The player will receive double, sometimes triple clan chat messages because of this. The problem is I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s caused because it seems to happen randomly, or when the server disconnects?

I&#39;ve made sure that all players are removed from the chat and the channel is cleaned when the player logs out yet it still happens.

Does anyone know the cause of this so I can fix it?

Much appreciated.</description>
