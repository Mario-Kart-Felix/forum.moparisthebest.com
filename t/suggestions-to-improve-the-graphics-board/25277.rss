    <title>Suggestions to improve the graphics board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestions-to-improve-the-graphics-board/25277</link>
    <description>I have a few simple and easy ideas to improve the graphics section!
Here are a few.

[b]No.1[/b]

A &quot;Request a sig&quot; Child board.

[b]No.2[/b]

SOTM (Sig of the month) Will have more entrys and more chances of winning. More time taken on the sigs.
(Taken from Fastballz idea)

[b]No.3[/b]

Some graphics section rules. * i know we don&#39;t really need them, but! they might just come in handy *

[b]No.4[/b]

MAYBE title tags.

Yes some of them do suck but they are just suggestions, there is no reason to think these will be emplyed.</description>

No.3 says nothing about bringing more activity to the board.<br>
And yes SOTD does seem good, but you would need help to enforce it every day and such.<br>
I would personally say you and Fastaballz for this.<br>
And title tags just to keep things neat =)<br>

<p>And for the prize…Well…If you win you get to go up to the SOTW and from SOTW maybe go to SOTM + the avatar…[/quote]thats a good idea because alot of people will end up having the avatar lol</p>

<p>Not bad… but would have to have a small prize. And would also need sort of a SOTD staff member to help out. because Chris gets busy sometimes.</p>
