    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-webclient-keeps-saying-unexpected-error/177533</link>
    <description>I followed a tut. I am trying to make the Dog Client V6 on web and I upload it all but it keeps saying &quot;Unexpected Error&#39; then it countdowns. I tried everything... I got the cache folder on my webserver, I basicly tried everything. Does anyone know how to fix this? :mad:</description>
