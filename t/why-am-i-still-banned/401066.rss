<p>Precisely. His IP doesn’t match mine because he rarely comes to my house. But I go to his all the time. My IPs(this one) and his, are the only 2 I’ve used. It’s pretty much been this way for years. If you look at our post histories from all the mopar sites, you can tell we’re 2 different people(dating way back to 2006). And I haven’t ban evaded? If you check my forum acc or w/e, I’ve never changed moparcraft usernames before. It’s always been “Extivium”</p>
<p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:16, topic:401066”]Where is this complete crap about him stopping after me telling him to coming from? He has the same IP as you which means he’s either you or your Brother so to be honest I smell a biased post.</p>
<p>I also do not recall you being online, or even present at that area. That would indicate you’re his brother thus backing up the ban evasion statement even more, so either way he’s breaking the rules.</p>
<p>Also, his ability to create a thread and complain on it, while denying all rules he broke just shows that he’s not to be trusted.[/quote]</p>
<p>Of course one of my friends will back me up, just as all of your mod friends are backing you up. Only difference is, all of you have more power on this server/forum than we do. I’m not exactly complaining, you could say I am trying to point out the corruption in some of the staff here. And your failure to admit a wrongful ban.</p>

So a mod banned you because he assumed a rule was implaced for whatever you did?<br>
[/quote]He was banned for spawn killing, when there was a rule that did state (yes I admit that it was a bit outdated, but the concept was the same ) you cannot PVP where people spawn.[/quote]</p>
<p>Why the hell do you and all the other moderators back each other up when you know you are wrong? The rule was so unclear that there was no way for him to know spawn killing was allowed except when Tom told him it wasn’t allowed, however, he stopped after Tom said it wasn’t allowed.</p>
<p>Besides, I am pretty sure Moparisthebest has more authority than you do. Even if the ban stands, why would you ban him any longer? He clearly understands it is against the rules and I am sure he won’t do it again. Banning is used to teach users a lesson, not to rid them of the server because you don’t like them.</p>

<p>Before I got banned it said “no killing spawn city”. That’s EXTREMELY unclear. If you can’t kill someone in their own city how can you raid etc? I was only banned because Tom doesn’t like me. I didn’t damage anything. I also stopped when he said that its apparently a rule.</p>
