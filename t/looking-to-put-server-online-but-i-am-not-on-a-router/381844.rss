              <p>Try the following and see if it worked.</p>
<p>Disable Your firewall, OR add an exception for Java and for the port you’re running your server on.</p>
<p>Check if you certain that you don’t have a router.<br>
Open a command shell and type</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ipconfig /all</code></pre>
<p>Then write down the standard gateway (most likely yours is 192.168.1.254).<br>
Now open a webbrowser and type the standard gateway in the url.</p>
<p>You should also assign a static ip, <a href="http://www.tech-faq.com/how-to-set-a-static-ip-address-in-windows.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.tech-faq.com/how-to-set-a-static-ip-address-in-windows.html</a></p>
