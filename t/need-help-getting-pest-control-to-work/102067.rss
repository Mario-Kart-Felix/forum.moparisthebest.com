Now here are the coords i came up with...
I need to work on the other stuff

x= 2659
y= 2676
Right off ship going on to the Island from the main Island

X= 2657
Y= 2639
Spot before entering the boat (where you wait for the game to begin)

X= 2656-2659
Y= 2614-2609
The spots where you are when the boat lands on the fighting island

x= 2661
y= 2639
right on the boat to enter the Fight

x= 3041
y= 3202

The spot right before you get on the boat to go to the P.C. Island (the one with the bank)
