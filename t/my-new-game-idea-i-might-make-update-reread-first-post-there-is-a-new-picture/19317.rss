    <title>My new game idea I might make. Update: Reread first post, there is a new picture</title>

    <description>I&#39;m hoping such a game does not exist.. But anyways:

I got this idea from reading mopar&#39;s thread about God from a programmer&#39;s view + That episode of south park with the semen cratures + that futurama episode where bender is launched into space and a little community forms onto bender&#39;s body + that epsidoe of the simpsons where a community forms with lisa&#39;s tooth on that brown stuff.. Lol I think you get the point. 

This wouldn&#39;t really be a game, just something you could observe. Basically, this would be a program that you could leave in your desktray. The camera would be birds eye view, looking upon little people. You&#39;d start out with less then 20 people, they could mate and grow larger and larger, etc.. You could throw materials in their world, such as rocks(for minerals), popsicle sticks(for wood). They would send out their own workers to gather these materials to build houses and things like that. The world would be quite large, allowing them to continually build themselves into communities. They may choose to follow gods, or even choose you(the player who gave them life and materials) as a god. They might eventually decide to go to war with each other and wipe themselves off the planet, or just wipe out certain areas of it.  The entire game would be made from AI, so you don&#39;t have much control over their actions other then giving them materials. You could leave it in your desktray and pause the development at anytime you want. There development patterns would be random too, they might build themselves a medi-evil style land, or modern, or futuristic. They might even decide to slaughter each other at the very begginging. It would be fun and interesting to see how they act.

So, still haven&#39;t decided if I will go through with this game because I&#39;m very tired of programming, but I&#39;ll probably start making it eventually. But, what are your views on this idea? Does it sound kinda cool?



edit:
First screenshot. Keep in mind, this is not an actual ingame screenshot, just something I threw together to give you an idea about what it&#39;s gonna look like. keep in mind, I did rip those textures off of google images, and where ever else I could get grass/stones..
To be honest this screenshot looks pretty bad, but think of it this way: It&#39;ll never get any worse then that, they are only going to improve more and more. Basically there is a few people standing around some buildings. It looks pretty plain I know, I&#39;ll build on it more and more as I progress in it. However, I won&#39;t be working on the game for a little while now, so just don&#39;t expect any updates on it for a while.

Yes he did seem kinda of pushy. How he was pulling out memberships like that and the game wasn’t out and how he was asking for money. Looked like a nice game the guy seemed kinda like a scammer like you said.</p>
