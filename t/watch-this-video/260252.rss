It&#39;s an hour and 40 minutes long, and exposes the lies the government has told us about marijuana such as why it was banned, and that it doesn&#39;t really kill brain cells (the test monkeys were suffocated with pure pot smoke, causing a lack of oxygen to their brain cells, thus killing the brain cells.)</description>

<p>What makes you think people will all of a sudden think they are big stoners, from it being legalized? People who are against weed probably won’t suddenly start if it was legal.

I just don’t think it should be and thats that. Its a drug people go around and say there stoners off of. Its pathetic. Some are really cool but others are just argonaut pricks who need to fuck off. Jme, your an example of a cool weed smoker, you smoke weed cause you like the effects. Your not smoking cause it makes you look cool.</p>

<p>Maybe he doesn’t want to get addicted to benzo’s? You realize the addiction is so powerful, it CAN kill you.</p>
<p>As for reaction times, don’t drive stoned then? They can make driving high illegal, it already is here.</p>
<p>I don’t believe legalizing it affects anything. If you want to get high, you’re going to do it regardless of the law. It’s not like everyone will suddenly become a stoner, and blow weed in your face every where you go. It can have many of the same laws that alcohol has. Age limits, doing it in public, etc.</p>
<p>I personally believe it should not be legalized, because I can currently grow gold in my closet. Marijuana being illegal only benefits drug dealers.</p>

              <p>I feel that it missed some great arguments for it, and certain areas were too biased for weed. Some of there facts were a little dodgy, and it’s quite easy to take what Joe Rogan says for truth. Actually most of it was good, one area that caught me is when they said marijuana doesn’t contain any cancerous compounds like cigarettes do. This isn’t quite true as it does contain some known carcinogens. However they are right that there is no proven link between marijuana and cancer. They went on a lot about “the facts they didn’t tell you” but they didn’t quite give the whole side for much. They start off with suffocating monkeys to give you a bad view of them (anti-marijuana studies?) from the beginning.</p>
<p>I thought it was great though, I’m glad they included Marc Emery’s case. That’s still going on, I think his extradition trial is coming up shortly. I liked the whole last half of it really. I think when talking about the health effects at the beginning there was so much more they could have talked about.</p>

<p>It’s an hour and 40 minutes long, and exposes the lies the government has told us about marijuana such as why it was banned, and that it doesn’t really kill brain cells (the test monkeys were suffocated with pure pot smoke, causing a lack of oxygen to their brain cells, thus killing the brain cells.)</p>
