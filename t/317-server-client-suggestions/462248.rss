<p>You’re not going to be able to do this unless you know some about Java, and some about 3D modeling, or get someone to do it for you (If you’re completely going to change the look and what not), also some base knowledge about cache packaging, and other things. I support anyone that’s trying something they’ve never tried before, however, this really should have more information, a couple pictures, and than be posted in the Server Development section.</p>

              <p>Just a server that has everything would be nice, and all other servers will be out of date, but noone has put the time and effort to do this.</p>
<p>but back on topic, for a regular 317 to give yourself owner is in the character folder find your character name and change player rights to 3. and I am going to school for engineering, some of my classes where on java, but I wont know how to mess with the games inner core much.</p>
<p>if you are really serious about it i suggest to make a thread on development teams. and explain to people what your doing and what you need help with and i’m sure just as long as you have a good imagination you will have a few people wanting to help since it will be more unique then any other server since every bases there server off runescape or off player killing…</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

              <p>if you want something unique and something that isnt runescape (using runescape engine but updating it to look nothing like runescape)… but you cant even give yourself owner on a 317… then you have a few years til you accomplish this.</p>
<p>I suggest starting with reading about java.</p>
