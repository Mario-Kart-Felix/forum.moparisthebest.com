    <description>hey, i hosted a server a few months ago but decided to take a break and shut it down. i host my server with no-ip. When i decided to start it back up i could not get it to run. i have made sure all the ips r correct, my host is up to date and my router is still port forwaded. My server works perfectly fine when using the local host but not no-ip. does anyone know how i could fix this or any other sites like no-ip that i could use to host my server?, nvm i got it</description>
