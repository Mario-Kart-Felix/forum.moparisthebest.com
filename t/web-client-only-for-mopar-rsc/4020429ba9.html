<p>It wasn‚Äôt illegal to drop trade on RSC. It was just common sense not to do it around people and there was a risk of losing the items due to disconnect or someone else picking them up. You weren‚Äôt allowed on 2 characters on the same world, but you could be on 2 if each were in a different world. Also players can transfer items from one account to another on real RSC if they knew how to do it right and it wasn‚Äôt in the rules that it wasn‚Äôt allowed.<br>
