<p>It wasn’t illegal to drop trade on RSC. It was just common sense not to do it around people and there was a risk of losing the items due to disconnect or someone else picking them up. You weren’t allowed on 2 characters on the same world, but you could be on 2 if each were in a different world. Also players can transfer items from one account to another on real RSC if they knew how to do it right and it wasn’t in the rules that it wasn’t allowed.</p>

For once I agree with Yoshie. MITB, I have an honest question for you. Have you ever actually played RSC? You don’t seem to have a vast knowledge on how things worked or do work to this day for that matter. I understand youre the head honcho or whatever, but maybe you should let the rule making be handled by someone else.<br>

<p>No, I’ve posted many times I’ve never really played RSC, I used to play RS2 but haven’t done that for a few years either.  But certain rules have always been on RS2, and so probably were on RSC as well, and just because Jagex was to incompetent and/or lazy to enforce those rules, doesn’t mean that I am.  :)[/quote]<br>
It wasn’t illegal to drop trade on RSC. It was just common sense not to do it around people and there was a risk of losing the items due to disconnect or someone else picking them up. You weren’t allowed on 2 characters on the same world, but you could be on 2 if each were in a different world. Also players can transfer items from one account to another on real RSC if they knew how to do it right and it wasn’t in the rules that it wasn’t allowed.</p>

The thing is we don’t want the game Jagex may have originally dreamed of. We want the game we played. If you limit us to one account at a time it will do nothing drive players away. Period then end. With such a low rate we will want to afk, and fish, or train and mine, or mine and fish. There will HAVE to be something for us to pass the time with the slow ass rate or people will get bored and quit.</p>

I was talking about one login per computer, enforced most likely with the client.  Of course the server would monitor multiple connections per IP as well.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t care if people want to cheat at the rules and log in more than one at a time, tough luck.<br>

So in order to create a new pker, one would have to either have two laptops up, or be forced to drop trade?</p>
<p>It just seems a little harsh to limit everyone to one when no one is going to be satisfied with only one account. Not to mention having to log off in order to fish for food for pking, or gather limps+eggs for str pots would get a little tedious.</p>
<p>I also recall that the webclient for the original Runescape (after rune_free.exe stopped being used I believe?) had a dropdown option as to how you were able to connect. By using two separate options, you could log two characters at once on the same computer.</p>
<p>If your goal is to stick to as close to the “original” as possible without making it so unappealing that people won’t play, I don’t really see the harm in extending it to two characters on at once, max.[/quote]</p>
<p>The rule in RSC (as it is in RS2 even now) is you can have multiple accounts, but they can’t interact (trade) with each other or be logged in at the same time, and drop trading is also against the rules, right?  So if this is to be close to ‘original’, then I should enforce all of those as best I can, right?</p>

<p>So, multiple connections are using a single IP address?  That seems a bit odd…</p>
<p>You can’t really enforce things like that with the client, people can easily bypass it.  I mean, it can always be logged rather than outright telling them they can’t log into multiple accounts, but it seems like there isn’t that much benefit.</p>

Took me a year+ to learn about it. Up until then, all my pkers were from drop trades in various locations I thought were “super secret.”</p>
<p>I do admit, from time to time, breaking in on other people’s drop trades and pissing them off. It was part of the appeal back then though. Everything had some sort of risk to it. Even leveling 1 def pkers had a chance of being screwed up due to no fatigue.</p>
