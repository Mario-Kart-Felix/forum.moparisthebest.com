    <title>[NEW] Fixing a laptop Hard drive?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-fixing-a-laptop-hard-drive/518598</link>
    <description>[s]Okay, before the title misleads you, I do not need to pay for windows 8 keys. My teachers is a part of MSDN (Microsoft Developer Network) and can get lists of keys (He gave me the extra&#39;s to the set of win7&#39;s he had). I&#39;ve got 3 computers, all running windows 7 currently. My Career tech school (where ^ teacher is) has already updated to windows 8, we spent 2 weeks doing so, and I don&#39;t like hopping between the two, as 8 is so much different than 7.
The real question is, Software and performance wise, is windows 8 worth the install?

Edit: I&#39;m really bad at asking questions. I get side tracked a lot.. Sorry.[/s]

The above shit is old and worthless.

So my friend did something to her laptop, I have no clue what. She told me she deleted the OS on it while drunk, but I feel there was more done than that. I have a windows 7 boot disc, and some linux ones. I also have a USB that I can put Windows 8, and just about any Linux os on it.
First, I put windows 8 on the USB and tried running it. It got to the after I clicked install (to just re-install a new OS), it froze at &quot;Start up is setting up&quot; or what ever. Okay, so I quit and tried the repair computer option. That froze as well. I decided to try my Ubuntu disc, and it loaded, but it wouldn&#39;t load the installer past where it checks if you have internet, power, and 4.4gbs of hard drive space. Then I tried active@ killdisk. You guessed it; that froze too. I cannot access the physical hard drive because it&#39;s a Dell Inspiron 3520 and the entire bottom is sealed. There&#39;s no panel to open the hard drive.
What do I do in a situation like this? -Aside from tell my friend you&#39;re S.O.L or to go see an expert. I want a solution I could try.</description>

I don’t know what she did. All I was told was it’s broken and she supposedly deleted the OS.<br>
Oh, yeah, she did say she threw it once. There’s also scratches on the top of the laptop, so obvious damage is there.<br>
There’s nothing on the drive and it can’t even be formatted etc.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Honestly I doubt she deleted the OS, it’s pretty bloody hard to do so really, you’d have to either use a command line program such as diskpart and have a decent amount of command line knowledge, or boot into another OS and delete from there, I mean who the hell does that when they’re drunk?!</p>
<p>Much more likely she got angry with it or something (drunken short temperedness) and either hit it or threw it, it’ll have to be a hard drive replacement.[/quote]Maybe she found out about the other lady? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>but as CJ has stated you are better off just getting a new HD. Not much you can do to repair it by the looks of the results.</p>

Nope, you may still be able to use it occasionally as just a large memory stick, but I wouldn’t use it for the OS or anything important[/quote]<br>
It wouldn’t even do that lol. Nothing can write to the drive.<br>
You can lock this though, thanks for the help.</p>

              <p>Okay this is what I got when I did their online test:</p>

Those are sectors that couldn't be properly read and that the hard disk logic is waiting for a write operation to try to remap to a spare sector (if available). According to the Reallocated Sector Count attribute, your hard disk seems to have available spare sectors. A simple disk surface scan won't be enough to force the remap operation. You need a read/write surface scan to remap the sector. The best option should be a tool that knows about what should be read from that sector so that it has some option to apply the best fix to the missing data.

The overall performance for this drive is 98%.</p>

SMART test it, sounds dodgy.  Speedfan has one built in if you haven’t got one handy.<br>
[/quote]<br>
What?[/quote]<br>
S.M.A.R.T. test it, it’s a hard drive test used to determine the health and performance of a hard drive, it’ll tell you if the drive is failing (which seems likely from what you’ve said).</p>
<p>If you download the program ‘Speedfan’ it has a built in tester that’ll help you do this, the program just runs in Windows.</p>

So I took the drive out of the computer, and I ran it via USB on my computer. I looked at it through Windows Disk Management, and it looked fine. I attempted to format and partition the drive (just to see what it’d do) and it said it couldn’t be partitioned. Don’t know why.<br>

and I’ll run Ubuntu here shortly.<br>
EDIT:<br>
Here’s the error for partitioning.<br>
Input/Output error during write on /dev/sda</p>
<p>Edit2:<br>
I plugged the drive back into Windows, and partitioned it to V:<br>
and it gave this error when trying to use windows CMD to change to it via change directory (cd):</p>

<p>Edit3: No, I cannot run chkdsk on windows because apparently the data is RAW.</p>

It’s not my computer. I told the girl that was getting it to have me tag-along.<br>

It’s something with the hard drive, that’s all I can point out right now.</p>

New question.<br>
On top of the post. I think there’s an issue with the WiFi card because when running a live copy of Ubuntu, it couldn’t see a wireless network.<br>

I’ve got a <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">shitty</span></span> (I mean it) video of what happens when ever I run ubuntu, no matter the version (I’ve got 2 discs with different versions, and I tried with 12.10 via usb).<br>
[youtube]<a href="http://youtu.be/m_OKYgUF7Ng%5B/youtube%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://youtu.be/m_OKYgUF7Ng[/youtube]</a><br>
All windows installers freeze at one point.<br>
Ignore the music. I was just covering background noise.</p>
<p>Also:<br>
it says “the creation of swap space in partition failed” and there’s more tech stuff but I didn’t copy it, upon attempt to install Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I don’t like that they made it oriented to touch screens. When ever I plug in a new usb device at my school, a thing pops up in the top right saying “Tap or click to…” Really? You couldn’t have a prompt asking if this was a touchscreen device or not?</p>
