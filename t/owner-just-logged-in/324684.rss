<p>The Runnable interface does indeed create a new Thread, The run method executes any action, in this case the Login Protocol is decoded and at the end of the login-block networking is done on a loop while the player is active. Now my point? Where is the “character login” done? I understand what your saying, you just didn’t explain yourself well and in a community as such, thats almost suicide.</p>
