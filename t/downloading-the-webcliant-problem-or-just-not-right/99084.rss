    <title>Downloading The Webcliant, Problem Or Just Not Right?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/downloading-the-webcliant-problem-or-just-not-right/99084</link>
    <description>I go to Moparscape.org/ and I go to the forums. There is a link that says &#39;Download Moparscape&#39; in BLUE. Everytime I do this, because sometimes I go to the library, I click the link, then I scroll down, and click free (90 day download). I usualy pick (via 3) #3. I put a shortcut on my desktop and when I usually do it, it shows up as a java looking thing. Now I think it might be because my computer was in the shop and hasnt got all the stuff on it yet, but now it shows up as purple books. 

Someone please tell me my problem, thanks! :)</description>
