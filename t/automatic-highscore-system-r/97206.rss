    <description> :D

Ok so I have about 90% of a full, completely automatic, no manual editting necessary Highscore system.

Now for the 10% Part  :|

OK so heres the deal:
I have the highscores writing to 1 common skill.txt file. EX would be attack.txt, which stores all the players on the attack highscores. 

So I bet your wondering what the problem is...
Well, the file functions correctly, but instead of writing over someone thats already in there, it duplicates them. This means that someone is repetitevly in that file. 

My question
How would you (and I mean I&#39;d love to have this code provided) make it so where you could say something like if the string matches one already in the file (starts with), then overwrite that line instead of making a new one.

R++ &amp; Credits in tutorial will be given to the person that gives me the code.</description>
