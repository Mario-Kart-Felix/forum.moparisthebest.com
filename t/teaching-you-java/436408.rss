    <description>[b][u]hey guys and girls! im gunna be putting some java &#39;tutorials&#39; up right here, its not ALL of java, but its a lot, and there will DEFINATLY be more coming! (if y&#39;all like it)[/u][/b]


public static void main(String args[]) {    always start with this under your public class line


System.out.print(&quot;insert words here&quot;); if you add &quot;ln&quot; after print you are able to get multiline print &quot;S&quot; MUST BE CAPITALISED AND THERE MUST BE A &quot;;&quot;
&quot;\t&quot; in a print line in the () is equal to pressing tab (5 spaces)
double tells java working with number (can have decimal) give name after

example: double x; under it put the name (x) and what it equals
if you have many doubles you can write them on same line using commas

example: x = 10

 to import something go over &quot;public class&quot; line

example:
import java.util.Scanner
class apples{

}

to tell java you want to use the scanner use variable &quot;scanner&quot;

example:

Scanner x = new Scanner(System.in); x = name
for user input use the Scanner x with System.out.println

example:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner x = new Scanner(System.in);
      System.out.println(x.nextLine());
   }
}

This will not put anything in console: you must type in console to get result

you can use scanner with double by making the scanner name and double variable names
to state these you use your double variable name = scanner name.nextDouble();
you can add both variables with a third (used for answer)
by doing (answer variable)  = (first number variable) + (second number variable);
to print answer to screen use System.out.println(answer variable);

combining all the above will make a simple addition calculator:

how it should look:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner dan = new Scanner(System.in);
      double fnum, snum, answer;
      System.out.println(&quot;Enter firts num:&quot;);
      fnum = dan.nextDouble();
      System.out.println(&quot;Enter second num:&quot;);
      snum= dan.nextDouble();
      answer = fnum + snum;
      System.out.println(answer);
   }
}

int  whole numbers no decimals or fractions (answer will always be int)
INT IS NOT LIKE DOUBLE, TO STATE AN INT YOU  DO:
INT NAME = NUMBER

example of int:

import java.util.Scanner;

public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner dan = new Scanner(System.in);
      int girls, boys, people;
      girls = 6;
      boys = 3;
      people = girls + boys;
      System.out.println(people);
         
   }
}

when you run this it will add girls (6) and boys (3) making the sum (people) 9 you can also use - * and / if you divide an uneven number with int you will get a whole number no decimals or fractions if you use % for the math sign you will get the &quot;numbers left over&quot;

to quickly add 1 to an int/double variable you do ++variable name you can put this as a new line before you print it or in the print if you put ++ after your variable you will get what your variable means

example:

x = 5
++x = 6
x++= 5

if you print again without any ++you will get your variable + 1

example:

x=5
System.out.println(x++) will give you 5  but if you put the same line under it without the ++ you get 6

System.out.println(x++)
System.out.println(x)
your result will be 
5
6

you can also use -- 

you can also add a number by using

variable name = variable name + number;

you can also make it shorter by doing 

variablename += number;

you can also use -= or *=

to write an if statement you need a variable first

example:

int test = 6;
if (test == 9) {

to write equals in an if statement you can use ==
!= is not equal
&lt; less than
&gt; greater than
&lt;= less than or equal to
&gt;= greater than or equal to

after the if&#39;s } you put else{

how it should look


public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int test = 6;
      if (test == 9) {
         System.out.println(&quot;yes&quot;);
      }else {
         System.out.println(&quot;wrong&quot;);
      }
   }
}

you can do multiple tests in 1 if statement by using double &amp; sign in if statement if one variable in the double test if is used in the &quot;else&quot; it will count them as both in the &quot;Else&quot; variable if both are not in the &quot;else&quot; both will be in the &quot;if&quot; answer

you can use || for &quot;or&quot; if one thing in the || is is good then it gives you a good answer (not the else) only way it wont work is if both are false

switch statements use same as if but its switch (variable name)  { then under cases 
case = value of variable is equal to (number)
used:
case number:   after case statements (after body of case) use break;

example:


public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int age
      age = 3;
      switch (age){
      case 1:
         System.out.println(&quot;You can Crawl&quot;)
         break;
      }
   }
}

when you do cases you need a default at the end (a statement saying if n0on of the values are used this will be)
how it should look:


public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int age;
      age = 3;
      switch (age){
      case 1:
         System.out.println(&quot;You can Crawl&quot;);
         break;
      case 2:
         System.out.println(&quot;you can talk&quot;);
         break;
      case 3:
         System.out.println(&quot;you can get in trouble&quot;);
         break;
      default:
         System.out.println(&quot;i dont know how old you are&quot;);
         break;
      }
   }
}


while loop word &quot;while&quot;
counter will continue printing something or doing a function until something stops it

example:


public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int counter = 0;
      while (counter &lt;10) {
         System.out.println(counter);
         counter++;
      }
   }
}

this means that as-long as there is a number less than 10 being printed the counter will keep printing, since the counter = 0 it would print forever, the only reason it is stopped is the &quot;counter++&quot; at the end which means that everyone printed will show a number 1 higher than the last, without this the &quot;while loop&quot; will keep printing &quot;0&quot; forever&quot; the loop knows to stop before 10 because of it&#39;s statement &quot;while counter&lt;10&quot;

to make a subclass go to source file click on your .java and click new class
do not put main after public void!!

to make both classes work together go back to your main file and type

your subclasses name objectnameObject = new your sublcasses name();
your objects nameObject. your void name();

example:


public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      myfirstprojectsubclass xObject  = new myfirstprojectsubclass();
      xObject.simplemessage();
   }
}

myfirstprojectsubclass is the subclass name and xObject is the object when you run your main class the message or functions written on the subclass will be put there
you can use this with scanner by making a different void in the second class
in the () after void you need String inside first then the name of the argument
any time you input a string in main class use input.nextLine

example:

String name = input.nextLine();

how it should look in the end:

main class:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);
      class2 xObject = new class2 ();
            System.out.println(&quot;Enter name here:&quot;);
            String name = input.nextLine();
            xObject.simplemessage(name);
   }
}

subclass:


public class class2 {
   public void simplemessage(String name){
      System.out.println(&quot;hello &quot; + name);
   }
}

this means that the string &quot;name&quot; in the subclass is  what were using for the input and the print in the class2 is what we want printed
in the mainclass we are just adding the scanner so the user can input their name and then were calling upon the second class

using the variable private before sting makes it so only the class its in can use that variable

printf = imports a string while printing always use %s at end of printf

what it should look like:

main class:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);
      class2 xObject = new class2 ();
            System.out.println(&quot;Enter name of first gf here:&quot;);
            String temp = input.nextLine();
            xObject.setName(temp);
            xObject.saying();
   }
}

class 2:


public class class2 {
   private String girlName;
   public void setName(String name){
      girlName=name;
   }
   public String getName(){
      return girlName;
   }
   public void saying(){
      System.out.printf(&quot;Your first gf was %s&quot;, getName());
   }
}

to make a constructor do the same thing as first public void setName(string name)
but use  public class2(String name){
      girlName=name; 

that is only an example
once you make this (under your private string) you can go back to main class and where you made your object just put &quot;the name you want here&quot; in the ()

else if statements are just like if statements this is how a full  else if file should look:

import java.util.Scanner;
public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int age = 65;
      
      if (age &gt;= 60) {
         System.out.println(&quot;you are a senior citizen&quot;);}
      else if (age &gt;=50){
         System.out.println(&quot;you are in your 50&#39;s&quot;);
      }
      else
         System.out.println(&quot;you are young&quot;);
         
   }
}

you don&#39;t need the import java.util.Scanner;
to make a conditional operator (small if statement)
make a variable, make a print in () put the test then ? then put the correct &quot;&quot; and the else &quot;&quot; separated by a :

how it should look:

int age = 21;
      System.out.println(age &gt; 50 ? &quot;you are old&quot; : &quot;you are young&quot;);

easy average finder:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
      int total = 0;
      int grade;
      int avg;
      int counter = 0;
      while (counter &lt; 10){
         grade = input.nextInt();
         total = total + grade;
         counter++;
      }
      avg = total/10;
      System.out.println(&quot;Your average is &quot; + avg);
   }
}

this uses all the tools we&#39;ve already covered, most of them

to use a for loop use the variable for then () inside the () you need 3 variables 1 to start, 1 to end, 1 to count by

how it should look:

for(int counter=1;counter&lt;=10;counter++){
         System.out.println(counter);

the int counter=1 is where it starts (1), counter&lt;=10 is where it ends (10) counter++ means its counting by 1 &quot;counter&quot; is the variable used for the last counter you can also use += to tell it how much you want to count by (over 1)

to use the do while loop make a variable then do do{} then in the {} do what you want as the body and then at the end of it on the } type while() and when you want it to end

how it should look:

int counter = 0;
      do{
         System.out.println(counter);
         counter++;
      }while(counter &lt;10);


counter is the variable that starts as 0 and all this does is add 1 to the counter (0) and print it until it gets to 10

there are many math methods:

math.abs = absolute value
math.ceil = rounds up 1 whole number
math.floor = rounds down 1 whole number
math.max = uses 2 numbers separated by comma and finds max
math.min = uses 2 numbers separated by comma finds minimum
math.pow = uses 2 numbers separated by comma, first number is base second is exponent
math.sqrt = finds square root

java.util.Random gives an import for a random number generator
you need the &quot;for&quot; loop to keep it going until 10 or however much you want
heres how it should look:

import java.util.Random;
public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Random dice = new Random();
      int number;
      for (int counter=1; counter&lt;=10 ;counter++){
         number = 1+dice.nextInt(6);
         System.out.println(number + &quot; &quot;);
      }
   }
}


the import is at the top and is used on the first line where we make an object &quot;dice&quot; we use the for loop to tell java we want it to repat making random numbers until it gets to 10 we use the number = 1+dice.nextInt(6) to tell java that we want number, the int  we made at the top to be dice.nextint(6) + 1 which means we want the dice to make 6 random numbers, the reason we put 1+ at the beginning is so that there is no &quot;0&quot; in the random number sequence

to make an Array you start with int then you make an obect[]=new int[]; in the second [] you need to write a number value (remember, ints are whole numbers) this shows how many values you will be using in your array

how it should look so far:

int bucky[]=new int[10];

&quot;bucky&quot; is our object name and as you can see it has [] next to it, this tells java its going to be an array then we have =new int [10] the [10] tells java we will be working with 10 values
after this first line you need to state the array values, and remember java starts from 0 so your array will go from 0-9 how you do this is you type your object name (bucky in this case) and then [] inside the [] you type the array number (in this case 0-9) how it will look

bucky[0]=87;
bucky[1]=543;

as you can see the array starts with 0 which we made equal to 87 and it can go all the way up to 9
once you&#39;ve stated these type a basic print statement and inside the () type your object name and the array number you want to use 

System.out.println(bucky[1]);

bucky is our our object name and [1] means we want to use the array bucky[1] which is 543, as seen above

you can also use an array initializer instead of typing out all your array values

int bucky[]={2,4,5,7,9};

bucky is our object name and we know its an array because of the [] as you can see, instead of typing =new int [] we used {} and put numbers in there, these numbers are what our array values will =, 2 would be bucky[0], 4 bucky[1],  5 bucky[2], 7 bucky[3], 9 bucky[4] you would print these the same way as before
if you put your arrayname.length the computer knows exactly what array you are talking about and you can use it

example:

for(int counter=0;counter&lt;bucky.length)


array table:

public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      System.out.println(&quot;Index\tValue&quot;);
      int bucky[]={32,12,18,54,2};
      for(int counter=0;counter&lt;bucky.length;counter++){
         System.out.println(counter + &quot;\t&quot; + bucky[counter]);
      }
   }
}

we created our array initializer then a forward look and used bucky.lenght to talk about our array and we started at 0, thats where the array starts then we outputted on the screen, counter which is the index and bucky[counter] which made it reference all the values  and print them out like this:

Index      Value
0      32
1      12
2      18
3      54
4      2

as you can see the index is the array number and value is what they equal

public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int bucky[]={21,16,86,21,3};
      int sum=0;
      for(int counter=0;counter&lt;bucky.length;counter++){
         sum+=bucky[counter];
         System.out.println(&quot;the sum of these numbers is \t&quot; + sum);
      }
   }
}

                           
how to add all the variables in your array to get their sum  (above) 
                            
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class myfirstproject {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Random rand = new Random();
      int freq[]=new int[7];
      for (int roll=1;roll&lt;1000;roll++){
         ++freq[1+rand.nextInt(6)];</description>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">hey guys and girls! im gunna be putting some java ‘tutorials’ up right here, its not ALL of java, but its a lot, and there will DEFINATLY be more coming! (if y’all like it)</span></span></p>
<p>public static void main(String args[]) {    always start with this under your public class line</p>
<p>System.out.print(“insert words here”); if you add “ln” after print you are able to get multiline print “S” MUST BE CAPITALISED AND THERE MUST BE A “;”<br>
“\t” in a print line in the () is equal to pressing tab (5 spaces)<br>
double tells java working with number (can have decimal) give name after</p>
<p>example: double x; under it put the name (x) and what it equals<br>
if you have many doubles you can write them on same line using commas</p>
<p>example: x = 10</p>
<p>to import something go over “public class” line</p>
<p>example:<br>
import java.util.Scanner<br>
class apples{</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>to tell java you want to use the scanner use variable “scanner”</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>Scanner x = new Scanner(System.in); x = name<br>
for user input use the Scanner x with System.out.println</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>import java.util.Scanner;</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
Scanner x = new Scanner(System.in);<br>
System.out.println(x.nextLine());<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>This will not put anything in console: you must type in console to get result</p>
<p>you can use scanner with double by making the scanner name and double variable names<br>
to state these you use your double variable name = scanner name.nextDouble();<br>
you can add both variables with a third (used for answer)<br>
by doing (answer variable)  = (first number variable) + (second number variable);<br>
to print answer to screen use System.out.println(answer variable);</p>
<p>combining all the above will make a simple addition calculator:</p>
<p>how it should look:</p>
<p>import java.util.Scanner;</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
Scanner dan = new Scanner(System.in);<br>
double fnum, snum, answer;<br>
System.out.println(“Enter firts num:”);<br>
fnum = dan.nextDouble();<br>
System.out.println(“Enter second num:”);<br>
snum= dan.nextDouble();<br>
answer = fnum + snum;<br>
System.out.println(answer);<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>int  whole numbers no decimals or fractions (answer will always be int)<br>
INT IS NOT LIKE DOUBLE, TO STATE AN INT YOU  DO:<br>
INT NAME = NUMBER</p>
<p>example of int:</p>
<p>import java.util.Scanner;</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
Scanner dan = new Scanner(System.in);<br>
int girls, boys, people;<br>
girls = 6;<br>
boys = 3;<br>
people = girls + boys;<br>
System.out.println(people);</p>
<p>}<br>
}</p>
<p>when you run this it will add girls (6) and boys (3) making the sum (people) 9 you can also use - * and / if you divide an uneven number with int you will get a whole number no decimals or fractions if you use % for the math sign you will get the “numbers left over”</p>
<p>to quickly add 1 to an int/double variable you do ++variable name you can put this as a new line before you print it or in the print if you put ++ after your variable you will get what your variable means</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>x = 5<br>
++x = 6<br>
x++= 5</p>
<p>if you print again without any ++you will get your variable + 1</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>x=5<br>
System.out.println(x++) will give you 5  but if you put the same line under it without the ++ you get 6</p>
<p>System.out.println(x++)<br>
System.out.println(x)<br>
your result will be<br>
5<br>
6</p>
<p>you can also use –</p>
<p>you can also add a number by using</p>
<p>variable name = variable name + number;</p>
<p>you can also make it shorter by doing</p>
<p>variablename += number;</p>
<p>you can also use -= or *=</p>
<p>to write an if statement you need a variable first</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>int test = 6;<br>
if (test == 9) {</p>
<p>to write equals in an if statement you can use ==<br>
!= is not equal<br>
&lt; less than</p>
<blockquote>
<p>greater than<br>
&lt;= less than or equal to<br>
= greater than or equal to</p>
</blockquote>
<p>after the if’s } you put else{</p>
<p>how it should look</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
int test = 6;<br>
if (test == 9) {<br>
System.out.println(“yes”);<br>
}else {<br>
System.out.println(“wrong”);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>you can do multiple tests in 1 if statement by using double &amp; sign in if statement if one variable in the double test if is used in the “else” it will count them as both in the “Else” variable if both are not in the “else” both will be in the “if” answer</p>
<p>you can use || for “or” if one thing in the || is is good then it gives you a good answer (not the else) only way it wont work is if both are false</p>
<p>switch statements use same as if but its switch (variable name)  { then under cases<br>
case = value of variable is equal to (number)<br>
used:<br>
case number:   after case statements (after body of case) use break;</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
int age<br>
age = 3;<br>
switch (age){<br>
case 1:<br>
System.out.println(“You can Crawl”)<br>
break;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>when you do cases you need a default at the end (a statement saying if n0on of the values are used this will be)<br>
how it should look:</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
int age;<br>
age = 3;<br>
switch (age){<br>
case 1:<br>
System.out.println(“You can Crawl”);<br>
break;<br>
case 2:<br>
System.out.println(“you can talk”);<br>
break;<br>
case 3:<br>
System.out.println(“you can get in trouble”);<br>
break;<br>
default:<br>
System.out.println(“i dont know how old you are”);<br>
break;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>while loop word “while”<br>
counter will continue printing something or doing a function until something stops it</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
int counter = 0;<br>
while (counter &lt;10) {<br>
System.out.println(counter);<br>
counter++;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>this means that as-long as there is a number less than 10 being printed the counter will keep printing, since the counter = 0 it would print forever, the only reason it is stopped is the “counter++” at the end which means that everyone printed will show a number 1 higher than the last, without this the “while loop” will keep printing “0” forever" the loop knows to stop before 10 because of it’s statement “while counter&lt;10”</p>
<p>to make a subclass go to source file click on your .java and click new class<br>
do not put main after public void!!</p>
<p>to make both classes work together go back to your main file and type</p>
<p>your subclasses name objectnameObject = new your sublcasses name();<br>
your objects nameObject. your void name();</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
myfirstprojectsubclass xObject  = new myfirstprojectsubclass();<br>
xObject.simplemessage();<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>myfirstprojectsubclass is the subclass name and xObject is the object when you run your main class the message or functions written on the subclass will be put there<br>
you can use this with scanner by making a different void in the second class<br>
in the () after void you need String inside first then the name of the argument<br>
any time you input a string in main class use input.nextLine</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>String name = input.nextLine();</p>
<p>how it should look in the end:</p>
<p>main class:</p>
<p>import java.util.Scanner;<br>
public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);<br>
class2 xObject = new class2 ();<br>
System.out.println(“Enter name here:”);<br>
String name = input.nextLine();<br>
xObject.simplemessage(name);<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>subclass:</p>
<p>public class class2 {<br>
public void simplemessage(String name){<br>
System.out.println("hello " + name);<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>this means that the string “name” in the subclass is  what were using for the input and the print in the class2 is what we want printed<br>
in the mainclass we are just adding the scanner so the user can input their name and then were calling upon the second class</p>
<p>using the variable private before sting makes it so only the class its in can use that variable</p>
<p>printf = imports a string while printing always use %s at end of printf</p>
<p>what it should look like:</p>
<p>main class:</p>
<p>import java.util.Scanner;<br>
public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);<br>
class2 xObject = new class2 ();<br>
System.out.println(“Enter name of first gf here:”);<br>
String temp = input.nextLine();<br>
xObject.setName(temp);<br>
xObject.saying();<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>class 2:</p>
<p>public class class2 {<br>
private String girlName;<br>
public void setName(String name){<br>
girlName=name;<br>
}<br>
public String getName(){<br>
return girlName;<br>
}<br>
public void saying(){<br>
System.out.printf(“Your first gf was %s”, getName());<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>to make a constructor do the same thing as first public void setName(string name)<br>
but use  public class2(String name){<br>
girlName=name;</p>
<p>that is only an example<br>
once you make this (under your private string) you can go back to main class and where you made your object just put “the name you want here” in the ()</p>
<p>else if statements are just like if statements this is how a full  else if file should look:</p>
<p>import java.util.Scanner;<br>
public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
int age = 65;</p>
<pre><code>  if (age &gt;= 60) {
     System.out.println("you are a senior citizen");}
  else if (age &gt;=50){
     System.out.println("you are in your 50's");
  }
  else
     System.out.println("you are young");
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
}</p>
<p>you don’t need the import java.util.Scanner;<br>
to make a conditional operator (small if statement)<br>
make a variable, make a print in () put the test then ? then put the correct “” and the else “” separated by a :</p>
<p>how it should look:</p>
<p>int age = 21;<br>
System.out.println(age &gt; 50 ? “you are old” : “you are young”);</p>
<p>easy average finder:<br>
import java.util.Scanner;<br>
public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);<br>
int total = 0;<br>
int grade;<br>
int avg;<br>
int counter = 0;<br>
while (counter &lt; 10){<br>
grade = input.nextInt();<br>
total = total + grade;<br>
counter++;<br>
}<br>
avg = total/10;<br>
System.out.println("Your average is " + avg);<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>this uses all the tools we’ve already covered, most of them</p>
<p>to use a for loop use the variable for then () inside the () you need 3 variables 1 to start, 1 to end, 1 to count by</p>
<p>how it should look:</p>
<p>for(int counter=1;counter&lt;=10;counter++){<br>
System.out.println(counter);</p>
<p>the int counter=1 is where it starts (1), counter&lt;=10 is where it ends (10) counter++ means its counting by 1 “counter” is the variable used for the last counter you can also use += to tell it how much you want to count by (over 1)</p>
<p>to use the do while loop make a variable then do do{} then in the {} do what you want as the body and then at the end of it on the } type while() and when you want it to end</p>
<p>how it should look:</p>
<p>int counter = 0;<br>
do{<br>
System.out.println(counter);<br>
counter++;<br>
}while(counter &lt;10);</p>
<p>counter is the variable that starts as 0 and all this does is add 1 to the counter (0) and print it until it gets to 10</p>
<p>there are many math methods:</p>
<p>math.abs = absolute value<br>
math.ceil = rounds up 1 whole number<br>
math.floor = rounds down 1 whole number<br>
math.max = uses 2 numbers separated by comma and finds max<br>
math.min = uses 2 numbers separated by comma finds minimum<br>
math.pow = uses 2 numbers separated by comma, first number is base second is exponent<br>
math.sqrt = finds square root</p>
<p>java.util.Random gives an import for a random number generator<br>
you need the “for” loop to keep it going until 10 or however much you want<br>
heres how it should look:</p>
<p>import java.util.Random;<br>
public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
Random dice = new Random();<br>
int number;<br>
for (int counter=1; counter&lt;=10 ;counter++){<br>
number = 1+dice.nextInt(6);<br>
System.out.println(number + " ");<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>the import is at the top and is used on the first line where we make an object “dice” we use the for loop to tell java we want it to repat making random numbers until it gets to 10 we use the number = 1+dice.nextInt(6) to tell java that we want number, the int  we made at the top to be dice.nextint(6) + 1 which means we want the dice to make 6 random numbers, the reason we put 1+ at the beginning is so that there is no “0” in the random number sequence</p>
<p>to make an Array you start with int then you make an obect[]=new int[]; in the second [] you need to write a number value (remember, ints are whole numbers) this shows how many values you will be using in your array</p>
<p>how it should look so far:</p>
<p>int bucky[]=new int[10];</p>
<p>“bucky” is our object name and as you can see it has [] next to it, this tells java its going to be an array then we have =new int [10] the [10] tells java we will be working with 10 values<br>
after this first line you need to state the array values, and remember java starts from 0 so your array will go from 0-9 how you do this is you type your object name (bucky in this case) and then [] inside the [] you type the array number (in this case 0-9) how it will look</p>
<p>bucky[0]=87;<br>
bucky[1]=543;</p>
<p>as you can see the array starts with 0 which we made equal to 87 and it can go all the way up to 9<br>
once you’ve stated these type a basic print statement and inside the () type your object name and the array number you want to use</p>
<p>System.out.println(bucky[1]);</p>
<p>bucky is our our object name and [1] means we want to use the array bucky[1] which is 543, as seen above</p>
<p>you can also use an array initializer instead of typing out all your array values</p>
<p>int bucky[]={2,4,5,7,9};</p>
<p>bucky is our object name and we know its an array because of the [] as you can see, instead of typing =new int [] we used {} and put numbers in there, these numbers are what our array values will =, 2 would be bucky[0], 4 bucky[1],  5 bucky[2], 7 bucky[3], 9 bucky[4] you would print these the same way as before<br>
if you put your arrayname.length the computer knows exactly what array you are talking about and you can use it</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>for(int counter=0;counter&lt;bucky.length)</p>
<p>array table:</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
System.out.println(“Index\tValue”);<br>
int bucky[]={32,12,18,54,2};<br>
for(int counter=0;counter&lt;bucky.length;counter++){<br>
System.out.println(counter + “\t” + bucky[counter]);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>we created our array initializer then a forward look and used bucky.lenght to talk about our array and we started at 0, thats where the array starts then we outputted on the screen, counter which is the index and bucky[counter] which made it reference all the values  and print them out like this:</p>
<p>Index      Value<br>
0      32<br>
1      12<br>
2      18<br>
3      54<br>
4      2</p>
<p>as you can see the index is the array number and value is what they equal</p>
<p>public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
int bucky[]={21,16,86,21,3};<br>
int sum=0;<br>
for(int counter=0;counter&lt;bucky.length;counter++){<br>
sum+=bucky[counter];<br>
System.out.println(“the sum of these numbers is \t” + sum);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>how to add all the variables in your array to get their sum  (above)</p>
<p>import java.util.Random;<br>
import java.util.Scanner;<br>
public class myfirstproject {<br>
public static void main(String args[]) {<br>
Random rand = new Random();<br>
int freq[]=new int[7];<br>
for (int roll=1;roll&lt;1000;roll++){<br>
++freq[1+rand.nextInt(6)];</p>
