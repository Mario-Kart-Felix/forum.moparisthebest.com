    <title>Spirit shield models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spirit-shield-models/406612</link>
    <description>My spirit shield models are really old and bland they all pretty much look white.. can someone upload the models and post which model numbers are for which ss. The spirit shield and blessed are ok though, I only need ely, arcane, divine, and spectral. I already have ints. (my ints would work with different models, right?) Thanks &lt;3
Btw heres what my spirit shields look like, i think they ok wielded but just in inventory..
