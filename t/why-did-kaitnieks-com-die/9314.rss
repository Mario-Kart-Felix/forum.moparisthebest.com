              <p>He already didn’t have the time for it.  Then with a baby on the way, he was going to have even less time for it.  He had some great admins/mods (  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) that were taking care of what needed taken care of, but with the legal issue and the family, it was too much for him to worry about.  He did disclose how much he was making with the google ads, and he wasn’t losing money.</p>
<p>Kaitnieks was a leader that wanted to be there.  I have heard complaints from other people on this forum that some staff members do not respond to private messages.  This is something Kaitnieks was very good at.  He would give each member the same amount of attention whether they were a “spammer” or a programmer.  Without having the time to keep up that leadership and then having to deal with legal troubles on top of that, he decided to throw in the towel.  Plus, in order to “beat” the legal issues, he would have had to revamp the forum which would cause lots of complaining and whining.  Go take a look at the private server section here.  Look at the type of posts that are in there.  Look at the attitudes of most of these people.  Then think about how the forum would be if that section was removed entirely.  There would be chaos.  All of a sudden these people couldn’t get what they wanted ( free source code pre-written for them ) and they would complain/spam/post in the wrongs sections/etc to get it back.</p>
<p>Kait’s forum went down when it was at its best.  Yes, it’s sad.  Yes, it had so much to offer.  Yes, I feel sorry for those that were not lucky enough to experience it themselves.</p>

              <p>Jafex was starting to take actions and Kaitnieks was getting a baby, he had a family and he probably ran out of time for this forum. He didn’t want to get in trouble and such with jafex, so he just ended it. It could be other stuff too that none of us never got to know about.</p>
