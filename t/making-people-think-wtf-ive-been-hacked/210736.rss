    <title>Making people think WTF!? Ive been hacked?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-people-think-wtf-ive-been-hacked/210736</link>
    <description>This is a little trick i just thought of.

Ok, first off make a thread on any forums. When there are lots of replies, rename the thread and edit the text inside. So you could make a thread called &#39; hello &#39; and someone could reply saying &#39; hello &#39; then you rename it to like anything and edit it to anything. Then they could easily think they have been hacked, and the person who hacked them said hello =/ 

Should work, havnt tried it myself yet. Only just thought of it, really hungry right now, going to get some breakfast :)</description>

<p>Thread title: Hello!</p>
<p>Threat body: How you doing?!</p>
<p>Response <span class="hashtag">#1:</span> I’m doing good.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>After that response, you edit the thread into something totally different, such as a chat about the economy or something. The first responder will look like a complete idiot, and you can laugh! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
