    <title>Unability to log in after a while</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unability-to-log-in-after-a-while/280079</link>
    <description>on my server players get on simple its ran on a 3GB VPS hosted computer (vpsland $68 a month)

well after a while, players arn&#39;t able to get on so i have to restart the server

i don&#39;t like using an auto restarter since sometimes it doesn&#39;t restart it correctly, it will close it, but won&#39;t open a new 1 (sometimes) and its down til it trys to restart again

so im asking, WAT CAUSES THIS?!
