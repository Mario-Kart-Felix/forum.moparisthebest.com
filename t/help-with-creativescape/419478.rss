              <p>[quote=“CoreVersion, post:3, topic:419478”]Right, i think what you’re trying to say is:</p>
<p>How can i edit Creative-Scape’s character files, to change their player rights? And, what program do i need to use in order to do this. (is it notepad or another program?)<br>
Also, how can i turn off sounds?<br>
Also again, How can i stop my username and password from saving on my client?<br>
And last but not least, (i have no idea what you’re trying to say here…)<br>
Please help!</p>
<p>OKaaaaaayyyy!<br>
Right, first off, you need to go into the folder “characters” in your source files. Then find the player that you want to edit, Eg, “Bob”<br>
Now, (just to be sure) Right click the file, and click “open with”, then look for “notepad”.</p>
<p>You should see a bunch of lines here;<br>
For player rights, you need to look for : character-rights =<br>
Now, there are 3, maybe 4 possibilities here.<br>
If you change the 0 to 1, That payer will become a Moderator (lowest staff position)<br>
If you change the 0 to 2, That player will become an Administrator (second highest, usually)<br>
If you change that 0 to 3, That player will become an ‘Owner’ (Highest, usually)<br>
MAYBE - If you change that 0 to a 4, That player may become a ‘Hidden Admin’ (Doesn’t always work…)</p>
<p>Okay, once you have chosen that, hit file &gt; save and exit out of it.</p>
<p>Great! Recap -<br>
1 = Mod<br>
2 = Admin<br>
3 = Owner/Co Owner<br>
4 = Hidden Admin</p>
<p>Generally, sounds are client-sided (i thought) and there might be an option on the actual client to turn them off. (In game, if you click the spanner tab, it might be there).</p>
<p>Right, for this, you might need to delve a little deeper into your files. &gt;:)  (client-sided)<br>
Try going into your client files, and look for something called usersets.<br>
For me, it’s in my files &gt; files &gt; core &gt; usersets.java and updateconfig.ini<br>
These are the files you may need to change.<br>
Open those up, and change the text:</p>
<p><code>character-username = ####
character-password = @@@@
character-namecolour = 0
character-chatcolour = 255
character-chattextcolour = 0
character-chattexteffect = 0
character-chattextdetail = 1</code></p>
<p>Okay, so, You can either remove or add things here:<br>
Delete #### to stop the client saving your username<br>
Add your username there to make the client save it.</p>
<p>Delete @@@@ to stop the client saving your password<br>
Add your password there to ake the client save it.</p>
<p>HANG ON!<br>
Don’t knock the closest person out if you can’t find those files.<br>
They maybe in your client.java (client sided)<br>
If you want to make it so there is a user and pass saved to the client, try searching (ctrl=f) for username = or something along those lines. Then just add your user and pass into those lines, save, compile and run.</p>
<p>Now, if you get any errors doing this, come back 'ere and we’ll help you out.<br>
Hope i helped :S</p>
