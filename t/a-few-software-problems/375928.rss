    <title>A few software problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-software-problems/375928</link>
    <description>I recently got ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop Edition, and it all installed just fine but it won&#39;t read my CD&#39;s, or my wireless network adapter. Any idea&#39;s why?

I tried to install the adapters files, but it would not work. So I seen the &#39;built in&#39; network adapter, and it did not work either.

I called their support, and they said to call the manufacturer of the wireless network adapter which is Belkin. After an hour of being on the phone with their tech support they finally told me I would have to call the Linux tech support.. I told them I did, and what they said.. But they still insisted that I recall them so I did.. And they both kept redirecting me to call the other company.

I decided to come here and see if any of you know how to fix this? I hate using Windows XP on my desktop.. I am on my laptop atm with Windows 7 which is way better then XP..

So any ideas on what could be wrong, or how to fix it?</description>

<p>Sorry, run them on the command line.  So, from the ubuntu docs:</p>
<p>Starting a Terminal<br>
In Gnome (Ubuntu)<br>
The terminal can be found at Applications menu -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Terminal.</p>
<p>In Xfce (Xubuntu)<br>
The terminal can be found at Applications menu -&gt; System -&gt; Terminal.</p>
<p>In KDE (Kubuntu)<br>
The terminal can be found at KMenu -&gt; System -&gt; Terminal Program (Konsole).</p>
<p>In LXDE (Lubuntu)<br>
The terminal can be found at Menu -&gt; Accessories -&gt; LXTerminal.</p>
<p>For general info regarding that: <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal" rel="nofollow noopener">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal</a></p>
<p>So post the results of those commands now. :)[/quote]<br>
:o What ever I just did made a screen pop up. “Installing driver(s) for Belkin Wireless G Network adapter.” And its loading my network. Thanks Mitb one of those commands or something I clicked made it work. It sucks being a new Linux user lol.</p>
