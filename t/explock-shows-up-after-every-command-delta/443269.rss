    <title>ExpLock shows up after every command [delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/explock-shows-up-after-every-command-delta/443269</link>
    <description>So for some ridiculous reason when ever I type a command e.g. &quot;::players&quot; it says My Exp has been (un)locked to (un)lock do ::lockxp (used the parenthesis because the command locks and unlocks.)
This is my code:
[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(lockxp&quot;)); {
if(expLock = false)
{
expLock = true;
sM(&quot;My Exp has been locked to unlock do ::lockxp&quot;);
}
if(expLock = true)
{
expLock = false;
sM(&quot;My Exp has been unlocked to lock do ::lockxp&quot;);
}
}[/code]
Why is it (un)locking after every command?</description>
