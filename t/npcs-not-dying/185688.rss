              <p>I had exactly the same problem. Its your NPCHandler. Download the ORIGINAL source, copy and paste all of your updates, edited parts of your OLD NPCHandler (That is to say, the one corrupted) into the new clean one. Compile and run = fix <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
