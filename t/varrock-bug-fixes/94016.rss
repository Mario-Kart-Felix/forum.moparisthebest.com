    <title>Varrock bug fixes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/varrock-bug-fixes/94016</link>
    <description>i noticed in testscape not sure about all other sources, that all the stairs object id 1723, 1722 adn some other stairs.
when you go up the stairs on varrock walls, it brings you up on wrong side of stairs, the side you went up, so its like you went on first stair and jumped up and over railing lol.
when you go down you end up about 10 squares (x y) away form the stairs on other side of wall. it happens with stairs at varrock bank west.
and the other stairs, the ladder type, in varrock west bank they put you through the roof, ya can only see half of you too.

anyway the point is is there varrock bug fixes for these bugs?
cause i dont understand how to edit them.
ex: this is object id 1722 stairs
the find option found:
[code]
					} else if (objectID == 1722) {
						stairs = 21;
						skillX = objectX;
						skillY = objectY;
						stairDistance = 2;
						stairDistanceAdd = 2;[/code]
[code]				else if (objectID == 1722)
				{
					heightLevel += 1;
					teleportToX = absX;
					teleportToY = absY;
				}
				break;[/code]

i dunno how to edit it so it goes to the correct side of stairs


cause if you go up stairs facing east you should be oging up on left and hit the top on the right side of stairs.

hope ya understand me

[br][size=1]Posted on: May 13, 2007, 07:08:50 AM[/size][hr]Maybe this would work? at least to make it so that the player doesent go up a floor when theres no flor under them, se there standing n air &lt;_&lt;

[code]				else if (objectID == 1722)
				{
					heightLevel += 1;
					teleportToX = objectX;
					teleportToY = objectY;
				}
				break;[/code]
