    <title>Packet Lost Type?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packet-lost-type/251742</link>
    <description>Well this is sort of a client side error, But i think it has something to do with my server.
The client im using is Bluurrs client, and the server is a Devo source.

This is basically what happens, Its the start to a quest im making.

It disconnects when the NPC dialogue is supposed to come up.
This is basically the code for it all
[code]
public void UpdateNPCChat() {
		/*sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4902);
		sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4903);
		sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4904);
		sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4905);
		sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 4906);*/
		sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;, 976);
		switch (NpcDialogue) {
			case 1:
				playertalk(&quot;Give me a quest!&quot;, 614);
				break;
			case 2:
				talk(&quot;Give me a quest what? &quot;, 706);
				break;
			case 3:
				choice3(&quot;Give me a quest plase.&quot;,&quot;Give me a quest or else!&quot;, &quot;Just stop messing around and give me a quest!&quot;);
				break;
			case 4:
				playertalk(&quot;Give me a quest plase.&quot;, 614);
				break;
			case 5:
				talk2(&quot;Well seeing as you asked nicley... I could do with some&quot;, &quot;help.&quot;, 706, 614);
				break;
			case 6:
				talk2(&quot;The wizard Grayzag next door decided he didin&#39;t like&quot;, &quot;me so he enlisted an army of hundreds of imps.&quot;, 706, 614);
				break;
			case 7:
				talk3(&quot;These imps stole all shorts of my things. Most of these&quot;, &quot;things I don&#39;t really care about, just eggs and balls of.&quot;, &quot;sring and things.&quot;, 706, 614);
				break;
			case 8:
				talk2(&quot;But they stole my four magical beads. There was a red&quot;, &quot;one, a yellow one, a black one, and a white one.&quot;, 706, 614);
				break;
			case 9:
				talk2(&quot;These imps have now spread out all over the knigdom.&quot;, &quot;Could you Get my beads back for me?&quot;, 706, 614);
				break;
			case 10:
				choice(&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;,&quot;I&#39;ve better things to do that chase imps.&quot;);
				break;
			case 11:
				playertalk(&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;, 614);
				break;
			case 12:
				talk(&quot;That&#39;s great, thank you.&quot;, 706);
				q8 = 1;
				sendQuest(&quot;@yel@Imp Catcher&quot;, 7340);
				break;
			case 13:
				playertalk(&quot;Just stop messing around and give me a quest!&quot;, 614);
				break;
			case 14:
				talk(&quot;Ah now you&#39;re assuming I have one to give.&quot;, 706);
				break;
			case 15:
				playertalk(&quot;I&#39;ve better things to do that chase imps.&quot;, 614);
				break;
			case 16:
				talk2(&quot;Well if you&#39;re not interested in the quests I have to&quot;,&quot;give you, don&#39;t waste my time by asking me for them.&quot;, 706, 614);

				playertalk(&quot;I&#39;ve got all four beads. It was hard work I can tell you.&quot;, 614);
				break;
			case 24:
				talk3(&quot;Give them here and I&#39;ll check that they really are MY&quot;, &quot;beads, before I give your reward. You&#39;ll like it it&#39;s&quot;, &quot;an amulet of accuracy.&quot;, 706, 614);
				break;
			case 25:
				playertalk(&quot;I have found some of your beads.&quot;, 614);
				break;
			case 26:
				talk3(&quot;Come back when you have them all. The colour of the&quot;, &quot;four beads that I need are red, yellow, black, and white.&quot;, &quot;Go chase some imps!&quot;, 706, 614);

				break;
			case 28:
				talk2(&quot;Well get on with it. I&#39;ve lost a white bead, a red bead, a&quot;, &quot;black bead, and a yellow bead. Go kill some imps!&quot;, 706, 614);
				break;
