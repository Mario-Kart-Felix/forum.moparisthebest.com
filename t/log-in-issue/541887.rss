    <title>Log-in issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/log-in-issue/541887</link>
    <description>Hello moparians.

Recently on project rainbow, a weird log-in bug popped up.
Sadly enough we got very limited information, on what is actually causing this.
This is what i got told, about the cause of the problem.
The error is because PIDs get fudgeed up when the VNC gets full.

When you try to log-in it says: &#39;Could not complete log-in, try using a different world&#39;.
The owner has been looking into player files, and sometimes they where completely blank.

It&#39;d be really appreciated if anyone knows what the problem causer can be.
Thanks for reading, hopefully you can provide us help.</description>
