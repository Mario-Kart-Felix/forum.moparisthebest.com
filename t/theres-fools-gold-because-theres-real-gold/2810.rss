    <description>If the government does have somethingto hide about the 9/11 attacks, they did a good job of hiding it by deliberately allowing the &quot;No Plane at the Pentagon&quot; theory to gain credibility

I am not going to prove that the plane did hit the pentagon, or didn&#39;t hit the pentagon. I am going to prove that the government wants people to believe that a plane did not hit the pentagon, because it makes it much easier to hide other things about 9/11.





[size=20pt]1[/size]
http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/07/gen.pentagon.pictures/
The government released this footage which proves absolutely nothing, and raises more questions than it answers. What motivation would they have for releasing such footage?


[size=20pt]2[/size]
[img]http://img55.imageshack.us/img55/5602/gasstation6lt.jpg[/img]
Immedietely after the attacks the government confiscated all video evidence that showed the plane flying toward the pentagon or hitting the pentagon, including the footage from security camera at this gas station, which could have cleared things up immedietely. Why confiscate the video and not reveal it to the public?



[size=20pt]3[/size]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It is a truth that a terrorist can attack any time, any place, using any technique and it&#39;s physically impossible to defend at every time and every place against every conceivable technique. Here we&#39;re talking about plastic knives and using an American Airlines flight filed with our citizens, and the [b]missile[/b] to damage this building and similar (inaudible) that damaged the World Trade Center. The only way to deal with this problem is by taking the battle to the terrorists, wherever they are, and dealing with them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumsfeld use of the word missile here is confusing. Some believe it to be a Freudian slip. Why not correct it in the official transcript of the interview:

The lawn of the pentagon was sanded over, for no reason.





In the first example, the government released information deliberately manufactured to raise doubts in peoples minds over what happened to the pentagon on 9/11. In the second example, the government hid information from the public to cause confusion.  In the third example, the government made a seemingly accidental error, which they never bothered to correct, and which supports conspiracy theorists. In the fourth example, the government took unexplainable action to mislead. 


The government deliberately created the model for a false conspiracy, which many people believe. I don&#39;t mind conspiracy theories, in fact, I think that there&#39;s probably a few out there that might be proven right, or partly right, in the future. But if you&#39;re buying into the &quot;Loose change&quot; mentality, you&#39;ve picked the wrong theory.

There are plenty of theories out there, pick one that isn&#39;t manufactured by the government:

Or get educated and make your own.</description>

              <p>I don’t agree with you. I think it is a conspiracy. The government could have easily photoshopped an image equivalent to what they released. There’s just so much evidence that doesn’t support that a plane hit the pentagon. Bystanders say the object flew about 20 feet above their car (If that happened, the jet engines would have blown the car away), discrediting the fact that the object was indeed an airplane.</p>
<p>It’s just funny in loose change when they show a list and pictures of all the supposed hijackers and 13 out of 15 of them are confirmed still alive by family members and various governments around the world:D. Funny how that sort of thing seems to happen, you know, hijaking a plane, crashing it, surviving 1500+ degree flames, and going back to live and work in saudi arabia/uae.</p>
<p>Just watch Loose Change with an open mind. You don’t have to believe it or not, but it is pretty mind-bending once you consider it.</p>

<p>But then what would the govt have to gain from staging 9/11?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They got the US citizens behind the attacking of Afganistan, which other governments was told there would be action against in Oct of 01. Well before 9/11 since an agreement could not be made to run an oil pipeline from the caspian sea region through that country.</p>
<p>By best accounts, 500-700 million in gold disappeared from the WTC4 building vaults.</p>
<p>There was alot of insider trading that gained from 10-15 billion in profits, alot of which was tracked back to people very high up in the CIA. (About 1.5 billion went unclaimed.)</p>
<p>It got the american people to back the war in Iraq. (Due to playing the fear factor brought on by 9/11).</p>
<p>That comes to mind right off.</p>
<p>Several intersting things about those.</p>
<p>The Taliban offered to try (not give up) but to try OBL if the US would give them some proof to take him to court over. We went to war instead. Dont forget we had already told other governments before 9/11 we was going to, so really, no matter what the Taliban did or didnt do we was going to war with them since the American company had stated they would not go forward with any plans on the pipeline until there was a friendlier government in Afganistan. Which at the time prompted Bush to say “this means war” (again BEFORE 9/11 ever happened).</p>
<p>The missing gold and metals from under WTC 4 in the vault… That would be one of the biggest hiests in US history, where was any news stories about that? Dont tell me it vaporized like the steel in the twin towers did too (Which the stories of those buildings failing has way too many problems to beleive as well, just find out the temp at which steel melts, and the highest possible temp the fire could had possibly been… Forget the fact there was molten steel, dont even go to that heat level, just try to get to the heat level that steel plasticates…GL)?</p>
<p>Not going to bother continuing on… Do some research, and you will answer your own question.</p>
<p>Also, a little note about the war with Iraq. If it was all about WMD’s… Why did we not take the offer from the Iraqi’s for our military to come into Iraq and search and look for them, wiht the only stipulation being Saddam be left in power when we left? Yes, our entire military could had walked into Iraq, occupied the country, and done anything they wanted, wherever they wanted to search of WMD’s, without a shot from either side ever being fired. All that had to be agreed to, was if there was no WMD’s found, we leave, and Saddam be left in power. So was it the WMD’s we was all told so much about or was it just the simple fact Bush wanted regime change in Iraq?</p>

<p>And as I mentioned, politics. How do you know what’s going on behind the scene? (if i used the right word now). Thanks to 9/11, the US government can know use the word “Terrorists” everywhere and blame it on them and do whatever they like. Thanks to 9/11, they can now attack countries who always were a threat to US? like Iran or that they don’t even simply like them, or that those countries are stopping the US from doing something. However they haven’t attacked Iran yet.</p>
<p>::</p>
<p>Copied from another 9/11 thread (Xerxes):</p>
<blockquote>For example, Sherton hotel and a gas station was recording when the "Boeing 747" hit Pentagon, so why did FBI come few minutes later and grabbed those records, which never was released to public? Why is for example the Pentagon lawn completely GREEN, without a single scratch? Why do so many people say they heard explostions? Why did the owner of WTC or WTC 7 make a contract that if something happends to them he shall get money or somthing similiar.
<p>Why, days and weeks later alot of training took places, and terrorist campaings.</p>
<p>Here is like a few things people wonder about;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>How did a failed Cessna pilot execute the Pentagon attack?<br>
(The guy they said flied into Pentagon, he couldn’t even fly a one-engine Cessna)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When did Flight 93 crash? Was it shot down? Do cell phones work at 30,000 feet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many hijackings were attempted? How many flights diverted?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What caused the collapse of a third skyscraper, WTC 7, which was not hit by a plane?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the movie they show how other buildings like burn for 24 hours and it never collapsed, how could WTC, who was build so great, to stand against a plane crash and such collapse after 10 seconds?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20041221155307646" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.911truth.org/article.php?story=20041221155307646</a> &lt;- Here you can find a bunch of reasons, if you really don’t think 9/11 was behind it, answer them please?.</p>
<p>Why did security guards get 12 hour shift? (if i am not wrong now), why did the bomb dogs get removed?.</p>
<p>Did you know a plan like this was written for Kennedy by some guy, so he could start a war against Kuba? But he refused the plan, and that may had been the reason for his death.</p>
<p>Bush also needed a new Pearl Harbor to be able to attack countries like Iran, Iraq, Afganhistan, Syria, Korea and who knows who else.</p>
<p>Why did when someone(can’t remember who, but in the movie you can see) say that no planes should be in the air, all the current ones in the air should land and no others could lift, but why were there still a couple planes on the air?</p>
<p>There were no fkn terrorist, how the hell could the Twin towers burn and explode just like that when it gets hit by a plane? Either it had to be bombs in the Twin towers, or it was not a plane. Maybe a missile.</p>
<p>I read about a couple buildings who was on fire for like 24 hours or more, and those buildings was older, and it didnt explode nor fall down or whatever.</p>
<p>And the logic is very clear:<br>
All those leaders have been trained not to give a damn about the people. Atleast thats what I think.<br>
They are ready to kill thousands of people, to accomplish what their want - I have no idea why they could have done it, whoever a couple reasons: War with Iraq, Iran, Afganistan and other countries, even Bush himself said World War 3 has started. A idea like this was brought to Kennedy, and he denied it all. So, why you telling me this wouldn’t happen?</p>

<p>I would write more, just bring on the questions <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>“Sort of related question, where is most of the oil coming from now that half of arabia is blown up? is it usa by any chance?”</p>
<p>How you know half arabia is blown up? You think they have their oil in the city or what? Wow.</p>
