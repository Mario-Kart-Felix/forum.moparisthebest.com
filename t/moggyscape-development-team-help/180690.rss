    <description>[size=10pt]MoggyScape Development Team 2008![/size]

Hi, I Have been getting bored of my old server ( AdScape ) so i have decided to make a whole new one. Thats where you come in, i have been working on the name for ages, it might be a bit bad, but i like it, my mum was walking down the street with me and saw a cat looking like it was gonna kill a bird or rat. And my mum said &quot;that&#39;s a moggy&quot; and i thought it was a good name. and its not taken.

The part where you come in is helping make designs.
specs, highscores page etc.
