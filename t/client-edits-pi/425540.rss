    <description>Hey guys I&#39;m wondering how I can change my client to make it have a fullscreen option, and a faster loading time if possible(it gets stuck at &quot;Unpacking Media - 80%&quot; for a good minute every time you load the client. Lastly I&#39;m trying to add a splash screen and I know how to add it while making a .jar (just adding to the manifest) but is it possible to do it another way so I can specify the time its appears for? Also while the splash screen is up is it possible to make it so during that the client loads so when the splash goes away it will be done loading and at the login screen?

I don&#39;t know if the splash screen and loading time are possible but if they are your help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks, Danny</description>
