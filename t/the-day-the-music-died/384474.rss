&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When asked what &quot;American Pie&quot; meant, McLean replied, &quot;It means I never have to work again.&quot; Later, he more seriously stated, &quot;You will find many interpretations of my lyrics but none of them by me... sorry to leave you all on your own like this but long ago I realized that songwriters should make their statements and move on, maintaining a dignified silence.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;On February 3, 1959, a small-plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, killed three American rock and roll musicians: Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J. P. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; Richardson, as well as the pilot, Roger Peterson.The day was later called The Day the Music Died by Don McLean, in his song &quot;American Pie&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
