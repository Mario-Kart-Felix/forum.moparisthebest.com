    <title>I&#39;ve got a no-ip, and i&#39;ve added the port to my firewall, what next?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ive-got-a-no-ip-and-ive-added-the-port-to-my-firewall-what-next/163186</link>
    <description>Question in topic name says it all really...? I have got a no-ip address and set the port to be excepted in the firewall settings. I don&#39;t have a router im using an adsl speedtouch 330, and I was wondering how I get my server to connect from this no-ip, do I have to make it run from it somehow, because at the moment when I enter the no-ip address and try to connect from it, it fails to connect? Please explain thankyou.

Because atm im loading up my no-ip thingy, typing the address into the mopar client and using the 43594 port but it says error connecting, when I try again connect…? Do I need to create a new account after I’ve been using my old one on the localhost for so long?</p>
