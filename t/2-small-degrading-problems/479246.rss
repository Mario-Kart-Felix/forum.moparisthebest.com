    <title>2 Small Degrading Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-small-degrading-problems/479246</link>
    <description>So i made degrading work, with both those codes in combatassistant

[code]	if (c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == 4888 &amp;&amp; c.dhAxe &gt; 0) {
		c.dhAxe -= 1;
	}

	if (c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] == 4888 &amp;&amp; c.dhAxe == 0) {
        	c.playerEquipment[c.playerWeapon] = -1;
        	c.getItems().addItem(7650, 0);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;@red@Your TEMP Dharok Axe has turned to dust&quot;);
	}[/code]

It makes the axe go -1 every hit, and when it reaches 0 it crumbles to dust.

But here are my 2 problems.

[u][b]1- [/b][/u]When it degrades you will get ashes in your inventory, and your axe will delete... but you still wear the model, so it looks like you wear an axe.
Perhaps if i could make the ashes in the weaponslot it will be normal.
But how would i do that, to what i change this code [code]c.getItems().addItem(7650, 0);[/code]
Instead of Additem, make it go in the weaponslot.


[u][b]2-[/b][/u] I&#39;ve made this for the whole armour set (Helm,Axe,Body,Legs)

So when i Compile it, its all good exept for the body, The compiler says that this isn&#39;t right
[code]	if (c.playerEquipment[c.playerBody] == 4894 &amp;&amp; c.dhBody &gt; 0) {
		c.dhBody -= 1;
	}

	if (c.playerEquipment[c.playerBody] == 4894 &amp;&amp; c.dhBody == 0) {
        	c.playerEquipment[c.playerBody] = -1;
        	c.getItems().addItem(7650, 0);
		c.sendMessage(&quot;@red@Your TEMP Dharok Body has turned to dust&quot;);
	}[/code]
all the c.playerBody are seen as an error
While he has no problems with the Legs helm or Axe
i dont get the problem =/ Perhaps because it is combatassistant??</description>
