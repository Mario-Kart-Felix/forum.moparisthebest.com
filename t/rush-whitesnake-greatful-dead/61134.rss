    <description>Yea well these three bands are like pretty old now but I still love em...

Rush has one of the best drummers in my opinion I mean just check out the songs

-Closer to the Heart
-Time stand still (One of there newer songs which was still a while back)
-Limelight
-Tom sawyer
-Lakeside park
-Fly by night


WhiteSnakes I just really like there style of how they play just check out these songs

-Now you&#39;re gone
-Sweet cherry Pie
-Here I go again on my own
-Is this love (this is just like a slow song)



Well Greatful dead isn&#39;t the best band out there but I enjoy this one song..
-I will get by


Now post some comments of what you think of these bands. Also post other songs that are awesome by these bands. :D</description>
