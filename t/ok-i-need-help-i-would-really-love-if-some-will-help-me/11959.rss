              <p>try these:<br>
shop.cfg<br>
Client.java<br>
for making it harder to level (otherwise know as the exp rate) search “fighttype != 3” in client.java<br>
for adding crystal chest, search “newobjects” in client.java, look at the method above and you should see</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">makeGlobalObject(int, int, int, int, int)</code></pre>
<p>you will need to call makeGlobalObject in the NewObjects method, then replace the ints with the numbers for these in order:<br>
(ObjectID, CoordX, CoordY, Heighth, Type)<br>
hieghth and type might be in the wrong place, if they are, use the search button on these forums.<br>
Oh yeah, and when you post new threads, don’t put the title in all caps, it’s against the rules</p>

              <p>to make a crystalchest, Find the object ID and add a new makeGlobalObject with it,  and then give the object action.</p>
<p>For the shop, go  into Autospawn.cfg and add a npc where you want it. Then go into shops.cfg and add the shop in there.</p>
<p>For the make training harder, either get a harder based source, or you could make a new account, and attack an npc one time, and see how much EXP you get. Go into client.java, and search how much exp you got, and there you go  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
