    <title>Need help with Intern317 (Written from scratch)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-intern317-written-from-scratch/268471</link>
    <description>Though it isn&#39;t very much. I started writing this not long ago and have ran across some
problems. I was wondering if someone more experienced, and by experienced I don&#39;t mean
can rename and recompile a source. If you know anything about server sockets and
setting up a basic listener could you please attempt to help retarded me...

Here is the link to my source: [url=http://uppit.com/I43GW1]http://uppit.com/I43GW1[/url]

It consists of 3 classes:

[ul][li]com.intern.core.Initiate[/li]
[li]com.intern.core.Server[/li]
[li]com.intern.util.Output[/li][/ul]


It&#39;s a very small attempt at a client listener so will take no time to download and look through.

[b]Edit[/b]: I made this using IntelliJ IDEA so the conventions and spacing may be a little distorted in
the everyday text editor.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 20, 2009, 11:04:17 pm[/size][hr]Hmm I&#39;m not surprised no one from this community could help me.</description>
