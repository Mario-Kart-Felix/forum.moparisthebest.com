A 6 year old can do a fair bit of damage actually, also I notice when I restrain people I end up unintentionally causing them pain as you have to exsert force and personally I wouldn’t want to use force on a 6 year old?

<p>Upon the police contacting you they are allowed to ‘detain’ you if investigating a crime. Handcuffs can only be used if the officer feels you might be a threat. Fastening the handcuffs in front actually renders them useless for officer protection.</p>

Another thing to consider is we don’t even have the full story. They could have made multiple attempts to phone the parents, but to no avail. Otherwise, the situation could have been so catastrophic (ie, the child was injuring other peers) that the police were called in emergency. Another perspective, maybe this is common for the particular child. Maybe they have had many instances of dangerous behavior, and the parents have done little or nothing to stop it. The police might have been an attempt at a last resort.</p>
<p>Or many other possibilities…<br>
[/quote]From what the news has stated, the child was  just having  a bad day. We have to remember anyway that the person is SIX. Meaning, that the child will not  know right from wrong at that age anyway. (law or not an eight year or old may not  know  right from wrong to a certain extent. )</p>

A 6 year old can do a fair bit of damage actually, also I notice when I restrain people I end up unintentionally causing them pain as you have to exsert force and personally I wouldn’t want to use force on a 6 year old? Then again it should be very easy to restrain a 6 year old of course but handcuffs are so much easier. The charges were a bit over the top though<br>
[/quote]It still doesn’t  matter. IN the U.S. by law the child has to be eight to even  arrest them. The law also states you can only be handcuffed if your a “threat to others” or “your rights have been taken away  as you are being arrested”</p>

<p>I was handcuffed because I called a police officer a dick once, was he in the right? I was 16.<br>
He didn’t put me in the back of the car or anything he just let me go about 20 minutes later. Jus curious.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>

<p>Thats wrong, just saying.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Upon the police contacting you they are allowed to ‘detain’ you if investigating a crime. Handcuffs can only be used if the officer feels you might be a threat. Fastening the handcuffs in front actually renders them useless for officer protection.</p>

<p>Actually a public/government type of building like that they probably could arrest you lol. I once walked into the local county government building  to assist my dad with something in the IT department and an officer had  tried to stop me  as well.</p>
