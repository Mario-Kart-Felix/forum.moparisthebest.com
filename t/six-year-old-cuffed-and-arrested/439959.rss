<p>Actually a public/government type of building like that they probably could arrest you lol. I once walked into the local county government building  to assist my dad with something in the IT department and an officer had  tried to stop me  as well.</p>

Another thing to consider is we don’t even have the full story. They could have made multiple attempts to phone the parents, but to no avail. Otherwise, the situation could have been so catastrophic (ie, the child was injuring other peers) that the police were called in emergency. Another perspective, maybe this is common for the particular child. Maybe they have had many instances of dangerous behavior, and the parents have done little or nothing to stop it.

Another thing to consider is we don’t even have the full story. They could have made multiple attempts to phone the parents, but to no avail. Otherwise, the situation could have been so catastrophic (ie, the child was injuring other peers) that the police were called in emergency. Another perspective, maybe this is common for the particular child. Maybe they have had many instances of dangerous behavior, and the parents have done little or nothing to stop it. The police might have been an attempt at a last resort.</p>

By what you said if they burned down the school then they’d call the parents before police? What if a kid had a heart attack then i think they would call the ambulance first.<br>
In the UK its not like that (I think, not sure) but I remember back when I was at primary school my mum filled out forms like that saying if something happened injury wise if it’d be okay to call the ambulance etc.</p>

              <p>Either way, the policy wasn’t followed for the school either. The parents are supposed to be called before any law enforcement/hospitalization/etc occurs. That’s in 99% of the school handbooks.</p>

<p>The point is, the police should not have had to restrain and cuff a 6 year old, the parents should have been called. 6 yearolds are still developing mentally, they generally fear their guardians or anyone younger. That 6 year old would have been so scared, imagine you were a 6 year old sitting in the back seat of a police car because you threw a tantrum about not getting your red crayon.</p>

<p>Then our view differs, I was like thefuck till I read what she had done. She had injured someone, as I said six year olds can do a fair bit of damage. What about the other kids? They could have been scared by her actions? Also, the teachers would be in an awkward position as they would want to handle it and they can’t.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/love">@love</a>, and why doesn’t it matter? By saying it doesn’t matter your neglecting my logical thought output as you’ve given no reason ;o.<br>
Tahorak basically summed it up for me but better;p. Ideally the parents would have come and taken her away to calm her down(if they could, doesn’t state what there relationship is like) but they weren’t there and the police were the only ones with the power that you can think of from the top of your head that were accessible at the time</p>

<p>can’t seem to find the legislation in my state <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>From what I have read though there is a lot of red tape on exactly what caused the actions on any child.</p>
<p>In Jacksonville georgia a ten year old had gotten a tatoo. THe mother was jailed cause she allowed it. If it was  just the child and nothing could be pinned on the mother then it wouldn’t be legal though. I am still fairly sure the legal age to go to juvenile hall in the state of Georgia is eight. I’ve heard that age before and  just asked my mom she says it is eight as well.</p>
