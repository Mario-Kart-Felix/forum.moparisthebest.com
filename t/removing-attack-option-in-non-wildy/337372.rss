    <title>Removing &quot;attack&quot; option in non-wildy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/removing-attack-option-in-non-wildy/337372</link>
    <description>Hello everyone I own one of those old silab servers running off of the Allstarscape V2 base.

Players who are in non-wildy still have the attack option visible on other players when they right click on them.  Though, if they select it nothing happens.  I would like it removed if you are in a safe zone.  Can anyone tell me how to do that?

I used the damn search button.  I didn&#39;t find anything that worked for my server.

Just please provide me with a link to a tutorial if I missed it.

Thanks.... any help appreciated.

I have a 317 sendMessage server....</description>
