    <title>Bought a new cell phone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bought-a-new-cell-phone/255537</link>
    <description>Well, on a profit of 200$...I bought an LG Rhythm. It&#39;s really decent for the price of 130$. It has a spinwheel like an ipod, with the choice of arrows if you don&#39;t like it. The spinwheel is pretty sensitive and moves nice and easy, so I use that instead of arrows.

It also has 4 touch buttons on the &#39;corner&#39; parts of the wheel(circles don&#39;t have corners...), which I increased sensitivity to the max and now they go right away and you can barely touch them.

It is built around a 512MB SD card but since I just got it I can&#39;t buy a bigger one nor do I need one.

It holds a lot of songs and is a slide phone, has many tools, customizations, and many things to download on it.

It has a lot more features to it and I would take a picture but unfortunately I have to go to school &gt;.&lt;

See ya mates.</description>
