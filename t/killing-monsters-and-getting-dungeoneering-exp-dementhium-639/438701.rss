    <title>Killing Monsters and Getting Dungeoneering Exp [Dementhium] [639]</title>

    <description>How would i go about making a specific NPC provide dungeoneering experience if it is killed.

Mainly, i really just need to know what file i would need to edit, and the Skill ID/Number of Dungeoneering, if somebody would like to provide me with a snippet of what i have to put that will be more than helpful as well.

Thank you for your time, and seeming consideration.

Have a great day.</description>
