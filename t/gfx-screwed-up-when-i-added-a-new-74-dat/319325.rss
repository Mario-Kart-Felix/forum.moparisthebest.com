    <title>GFX screwed up when i added a new 74.dat</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gfx-screwed-up-when-i-added-a-new-74-dat/319325</link>
    <description>Okay, so i added this 74.dat in the Client Hacking Section.

It included all godsword special attack animations ++ SilentCj&#39;s stances.

I also added the current Runescape whip model at the same time, when i compiled the client it screwed up.

Most gfx numbers increased by 1, therefore my Ice Barrage looks like smth else, Granite maul gfx spell looks like a spell from ancients. I now know that the 98% real godsword specs is the problem. when i added cj&#39;s .dat back, it didnt do anything. it still failed. :\ 

Help?</description>
