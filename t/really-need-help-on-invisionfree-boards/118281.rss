    <title>Really need help on invisionfree boards</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/really-need-help-on-invisionfree-boards/118281</link>
    <description>Okay, so we only have 10 members, now, but i worked hard on the skin and such, and it&#39;s fairly active for number of users. I wanna go and change the Personal Photo for myself, (I&#39;m the administrator) and it said &quot;the board administrator has now allowed your permissions to edit this section&quot; or something like that. My question is, how do I allow Administrators to  change other members/their own personal photo?

Help appreciated!</description>
