    <title>Server Null Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-null-problem/315095</link>
    <description>Hey. For the past days I have been playing my server with friends. I have had no problems until one day my friend wasnt able to log on. This has continued and I cant find any way to fix it.

Source: Pr0digyscape (Based on Delta) , but I edited a lot, made own client etc.

I had tried using the unedited version of pr0digyscape but got the same or similar errors.

This is the error found in runserver.bat :


[code]Servername.
