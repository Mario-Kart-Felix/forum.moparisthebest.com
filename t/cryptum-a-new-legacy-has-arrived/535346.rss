[B]NOTICE: Now that I have a development team, this server will be based on player vs. player until enough content is added for a stable economy. Expect a beta release as soon as server clipping is finished![/B]

[B]What is Cryptum?[/B]

[I]Cryptum is a RuneScape private server based off the 600+ protocol. Our goal is to achieve a fully functional server with plenty of interactions and miscellaneous things for players to do. One thing that most servers lack is social interactions. With out a good player base, a server is nothing and is most likely dull and boring. We don&#39;t want that to happen. We want you to enjoy your time on the game and just flat out have fun with your friends! But you can only do that when you enjoy yourself in the game too. We think that a server with the home location at Edgeville and basic shops and junk is ridiculous. We want to spice things up a bit. How will be do this? By adding events, quests and a butt load of content of course! This project is going to take a while, but we hope that we can achieve this with the little spare time that we have. Anyways, enough of all this blabbering and let&#39;s get to the content.[/I]

[b]Latest plan:[/b]

[i]I want the game to have some sort of story, to make it interesting ya&#39; know? After the Isles of Gielinor, I really thought these concepts were cool. I&#39;m thinking possibly, you start out in the Lumbridge cellar. You have no idea who you are or why you are here. Your whole story is based off you trying to find out who you are by doing quests and missions for clues. (quickly typed-up plot.)[/i]

This server is based off the custom framework called Niobe and was created by Relex Lawl.

<p>No, it’s not a real 600+. It’s a 317 loading 600+ data, but the reason I’m doing this is because it’s another excuse to use the Keldagrim client.</p>
<p>EDIT: I take nearly to none of the credit in this thread so far. It’s mainly Relex’s work.</p>

<p>Sorry! I lost internet for a week. I will make a repository when I have the time to actually get things progressing, you know? I don’t want to upload anything when I haven’t really done any work to it yet.</p>

<p>[B]NOTICE: Now that I have a development team, this server will be based on player vs. player until enough content is added for a stable economy. Expect a beta release as soon as server clipping is finished![/B]</p>
<p>[B]What is Cryptum?[/B]</p>
<p>[I]Cryptum is a RuneScape private server based off the 600+ protocol. Our goal is to achieve a fully functional server with plenty of interactions and miscellaneous things for players to do. One thing that most servers lack is social interactions. With out a good player base, a server is nothing and is most likely dull and boring. We don’t want that to happen. We want you to enjoy your time on the game and just flat out have fun with your friends! But you can only do that when you enjoy yourself in the game too. We think that a server with the home location at Edgeville and basic shops and junk is ridiculous. We want to spice things up a bit. How will be do this? By adding events, quests and a butt load of content of course! This project is going to take a while, but we hope that we can achieve this with the little spare time that we have. Anyways, enough of all this blabbering and let’s get to the content.[/I]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Latest plan:</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">I want the game to have some sort of story, to make it interesting ya’ know? After the Isles of Gielinor, I really thought these concepts were cool. I’m thinking possibly, you start out in the Lumbridge cellar. You have no idea who you are or why you are here. Your whole story is based off you trying to find out who you are by doing quests and missions for clues. (quickly typed-up plot.)</span></p>
<p>This server is based off the custom framework called Niobe and was created by Relex Lawl.</p>
