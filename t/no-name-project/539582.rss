    <description>Hello all,

It&#39;s been a very long time since I have actually done any projects/programming more than a year at least so this will be a little...slow at first. I am not honestly sure what I am aiming for. I have played several rsps in the recent week mostly out of depression and they all seem to lack one thing or another. Below are my aims somewhat:

[u][b]Goals/Aims: [/b][/u]

-Content filled
-As bug free as I can make it I don&#39;t claim to be &quot;pro&quot; but I am not scared of asking for help either!
-At the current time it will not to be hosted however if there is enough desire later much later in the future...we shall see
-I want this to be a learning experience. When I stopped programming I was at the learning curve where everything started to make more and more sense and I fear what stopping at that gap may have or not have done. 

[b][u]Skills:[/u][/b]

As most of you know I am mostly a skiller on RuneScape/private servers purely because just that, I like to skill. I most likely will NOT be focusing on combat. If I ever decide to actually host I will probably have to get somebody to assist me in rewriting combat entirely. 

The skills on the server will be as near to 100% as I can make them and as bug free as I can make them. I may even host a day of testing for specific skills only when the time comes. Please keep in mind that all of this is in future stages as I will first have to clear out my old source and rewrite well... a crap load of stuff xD...

[b][u]Skill that&#39;s are in need/will be done[/u][/b]

*Please note the sprites I downloaded and all are a higher revision and was intentional however I do plan to downgrade the skill interface cause this most likely won&#39;t have dungeonering etc in it. (just the basic stuff from 377 or so) 

Legend: Not started/Currently being worked on/Completed

-Agility (ALL COURSES ON 474!)
-RuneCrafting
-Fletching/Woodcutting/firemaking ( I normally design these all at the same time on purpose as I train them at the same time ) 
-Mining / Smithing ( ^ ) 
-Fishing/Cooking ( ^ ) 
-Farming/herblore ( ^ ) 
-Thieving
-Crafting ( I may or may not do all content for this skill the unreleased version of myth-scape had like 85% of all crafting already in it and I really don&#39;t feel like rewriting it all again as I don&#39;t have my old files so we shall see... ) 

[b][u]Update Log: [/u][/b]

[u]Feb 1, 2014[/u]
-Removed all skills except crafting at the moment(not that this source had many anyway...)
--Repackaged (pretty much to look like PI packaging and that&#39;s only because I actually liked the way it was packaged overall besides a couple of minor path differences ) 
[u]Feb 2, 2014[/u]
-Added basic clipping system (I will consult with a couple of friends on how this system can be improved at a future date) 
[s]-Started work on agility (Ape atoll mostly :)...hopefully I didn&#39;t chew off more than I can chew I can already tell I will have some difficulty  with this but I am up for the challenge! ) [/s] UPDATED see below
-Fixed a couple of nullpointers I was getting in logout/while banking as well
-Totally removed starter cause I don&#39;t believe in having a bunch of crap and probably won&#39;t even have one in the first place....
-found out how to use the camera packet ( thank you arham &lt;3 ) 
-completed adding basic ape atoll data, course is fully functional mostly bug fixes now
-started working on werewolf course...will probably finish around Tuesday I don&#39;t have all the data I need so will have to do some research ;) (where is nolan when I need him :( ) 
-made a strong  attempt  at cleaning out some of client class...yeah.... still a long way to go ...
[u]2/5/14[/u]
-Added grahams event system ( still has a few issues I am working out ) I at least attempted my own system and it just yeah... so yeah... I will attempt it again later however I do not feel at this time I can honestly develop one as it should be. 
-Werewolf course progress ( I still need some animations if anybody wishes to help...)  was unable to get a better picture due to the event system constantly throwing errors whenever an event is done ( I actually got nulled or something right after I took picture...) 
-Started working on my firemaking skill as well but not ready to post picture of it. 
[u]2/7/13[/u]
Nothing too major was done today but here you go
-completed firemaking to the best of my abilities this includes
--log fire that moves with proper clipping
-has proper gfx/timer
-hd client support for the firemaking ( in other words it isn&#39;t like the original crappy firemaking  gfx where it stays still :p ) 
-can&#39;t light in bank/duel arena type of stuff and other minigames not that I have any at the moment!
-can&#39;t light fires on top of each
-added the multi color fire thingies I forget what they are called ( again lol...firestarters~^  ) 
In other news...
-started woodcutting base currently supports chopping trees but nothing else still need to make stumps, timers, proper ax for each level etc etc

              <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>It’s been a very long time since I have actually done any projects/programming more than a year at least so this will be a little…slow at first. I am not honestly sure what I am aiming for. I have played several rsps in the recent week mostly out of depression and they all seem to lack one thing or another. Below are my aims somewhat:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Goals/Aims: </span></span></p>
<p>-Content filled<br>
-As bug free as I can make it I don’t claim to be “pro” but I am not scared of asking for help either!<br>
-At the current time it will not to be hosted however if there is enough desire later much later in the future…we shall see<br>
-I want this to be a learning experience. When I stopped programming I was at the learning curve where everything started to make more and more sense and I fear what stopping at that gap may have or not have done.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Skills:</span></span></p>
<p>As most of you know I am mostly a skiller on RuneScape/private servers purely because just that, I like to skill. I most likely will NOT be focusing on combat. If I ever decide to actually host I will probably have to get somebody to assist me in rewriting combat entirely.</p>
<p>The skills on the server will be as near to 100% as I can make them and as bug free as I can make them. I may even host a day of testing for specific skills only when the time comes. Please keep in mind that all of this is in future stages as I will first have to clear out my old source and rewrite well… a crap load of stuff xD…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Skill that’s are in need/will be done</span></span></p>
<p>*Please note the sprites I downloaded and all are a higher revision and was intentional however I do plan to downgrade the skill interface cause this most likely won’t have dungeonering etc in it. (just the basic stuff from 377 or so)</p>
<p>Legend: Not started/Currently being worked on/Completed</p>
<p>-Agility (ALL COURSES ON 474!)<br>
-RuneCrafting<br>
-Fletching/Woodcutting/firemaking ( I normally design these all at the same time on purpose as I train them at the same time )<br>
-Mining / Smithing ( ^ )<br>
-Fishing/Cooking ( ^ )<br>
-Farming/herblore ( ^ )<br>
-Thieving<br>
-Crafting ( I may or may not do all content for this skill the unreleased version of myth-scape had like 85% of all crafting already in it and I really don’t feel like rewriting it all again as I don’t have my old files so we shall see… )</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Update Log: </span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Feb 1, 2014</span><br>
-Removed all skills except crafting at the moment(not that this source had many anyway…)<br>
–Repackaged (pretty much to look like PI packaging and that’s only because I actually liked the way it was packaged overall besides a couple of minor path differences )<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Feb 2, 2014</span><br>
-Added basic clipping system (I will consult with a couple of friends on how this system can be improved at a future date)<br>
<span class="bbcode-s">-Started work on agility (Ape atoll mostly :)…hopefully I didn’t chew off more than I can chew I can already tell I will have some difficulty  with this but I am up for the challenge! ) </span> UPDATED see below<br>
-Fixed a couple of nullpointers I was getting in logout/while banking as well<br>
-Totally removed starter cause I don’t believe in having a bunch of crap and probably won’t even have one in the first place…<br>
-found out how to use the camera packet ( thank you arham &lt;3 )<br>
-completed adding basic ape atoll data, course is fully functional mostly bug fixes now<br>
-started working on werewolf course…will probably finish around Tuesday I don’t have all the data I need so will have to do some research <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> (where is nolan when I need him <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> )<br>
-made a strong  attempt  at cleaning out some of client class…yeah… still a long way to go …<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">2/5/14</span><br>
-Added grahams event system ( still has a few issues I am working out ) I at least attempted my own system and it just yeah… so yeah… I will attempt it again later however I do not feel at this time I can honestly develop one as it should be.<br>
-Werewolf course progress ( I still need some animations if anybody wishes to help…)  was unable to get a better picture due to the event system constantly throwing errors whenever an event is done ( I actually got nulled or something right after I took picture…)<br>
-Started working on my firemaking skill as well but not ready to post picture of it.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">2/7/13</span><br>
Nothing too major was done today but here you go<br>
-completed firemaking to the best of my abilities this includes<br>
–log fire that moves with proper clipping<br>
-has proper gfx/timer<br>
-hd client support for the firemaking ( in other words it isn’t like the original crappy firemaking  gfx where it stays still <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )<br>
-can’t light in bank/duel arena type of stuff and other minigames not that I have any at the moment!<br>
-can’t light fires on top of each<br>
-added the multi color fire thingies I forget what they are called ( again lol…firestarters~^  )<br>
In other news…<br>
-started woodcutting base currently supports chopping trees but nothing else still need to make stumps, timers, proper ax for each level etc etc</p>
