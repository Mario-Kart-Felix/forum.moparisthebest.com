    <title>At my whits end</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/at-my-whits-end/226173</link>
    <description>The other day my desktop computer, which has been needing a reformat for a while now just to get it back to near-new condition and stop the occasional Blue Screen of Death cropping up, got a virus. I don&#39;t blame it, I mean not installing virus protection isn&#39;t a good idea.

So I got onto my laptop, downloaded me a real fine looking torrent of Windows XP pro. Got that ISO burned to a dvd and shoved [s]my dick[/s] the dvd into the drive.

I set the first boot device to DVD. I pressed any key to boot to the DVD. I created a 20GB/80GB partition on my hard drive and began formatting with NTFS. It got to that point where the wolf howls at the moon and the computer screen reads : &quot;Rebooting in: 14 seconds, press the Enter key to reboot now&quot;.

It was time to boot into Windows for the very first time. 

I got past the boot screen, past the Windows XP loading screen to. The next screen was a one I shall not be telling my grand children about. Nor my children.

It was the BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH. Horrifyingly I fell to the floor next to my computer tower and slapped the front, trying, praying to find the reset button. Luckily my right index finger was exactly on target and the strange drone of my computers fans began again.

Those 14 seconds waiting for my fate to be decided were the worst of my life. Only to be met with the once again same horrifying screen of blue. It was a wall, blocking my way to the internet where all of my wildest dreams come true.

Now I decided to myself, I though, and thunk, and thunk_ some more. 

&quot;I must, to the old installation disk, try once more I must.&quot;

So it was time to find my old XP home installation disk. The one with a valid key that I purchased myself all those years ago. I found it swiftly from my bottom drawer and plugged it in.

This time I didn&#39;t even get so far. Everytime I boot up into the windows xp disk it gets to the screen where it ask if I want to Install, Repair or Exit. It stays on that screen for a few seconds and then my computer switches itself off.


I&#39;ve tried everything it wont work. Just switches itself off. I&#39;ve taken all uneeded hardware out, I&#39;ve switched to a different hard drive, i&#39;ve switched ram. 

The only thing I think it could be is my mother board has some how topped itself.

<p>Also: Yeah pretty sure my computers problem is that the things that attach the heatsink to my board have snapped and it is falling lose. My computer runs fine when i run it on its side though (gravity keeping the heatsink/fan on the processor). So i guess I need to get a new one.</p>

Lol I can’t boot in to safe mode because there is now no OS on my hard drive.</p>

              <p>The other day my desktop computer, which has been needing a reformat for a while now just to get it back to near-new condition and stop the occasional Blue Screen of Death cropping up, got a virus. I don’t blame it, I mean not installing virus protection isn’t a good idea.</p>
<p>So I got onto my laptop, downloaded me a real fine looking torrent of Windows XP pro. Got that ISO burned to a dvd and shoved <span class="bbcode-s">my dick</span> the dvd into the drive.</p>
<p>I set the first boot device to DVD. I pressed any key to boot to the DVD. I created a 20GB/80GB partition on my hard drive and began formatting with NTFS. It got to that point where the wolf howls at the moon and the computer screen reads : “Rebooting in: 14 seconds, press the Enter key to reboot now”.</p>
<p>It was time to boot into Windows for the very first time.</p>
<p>I got past the boot screen, past the Windows XP loading screen to. The next screen was a one I shall not be telling my grand children about. Nor my children.</p>
<p>It was the BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH. Horrifyingly I fell to the floor next to my computer tower and slapped the front, trying, praying to find the reset button. Luckily my right index finger was exactly on target and the strange drone of my computers fans began again.</p>
<p>Those 14 seconds waiting for my fate to be decided were the worst of my life. Only to be met with the once again same horrifying screen of blue. It was a wall, blocking my way to the internet where all of my wildest dreams come true.</p>
<p>Now I decided to myself, I though, and thunk, and thunk_ some more.</p>
<p>“I must, to the old installation disk, try once more I must.”</p>
<p>So it was time to find my old XP home installation disk. The one with a valid key that I purchased myself all those years ago. I found it swiftly from my bottom drawer and plugged it in.</p>
<p>This time I didn’t even get so far. Everytime I boot up into the windows xp disk it gets to the screen where it ask if I want to Install, Repair or Exit. It stays on that screen for a few seconds and then my computer switches itself off.</p>
<p>I’ve tried everything it wont work. Just switches itself off. I’ve taken all uneeded hardware out, I’ve switched to a different hard drive, i’ve switched ram.</p>
<p>The only thing I think it could be is my mother board has some how topped itself.</p>
<p>HALP PLZ</p>
