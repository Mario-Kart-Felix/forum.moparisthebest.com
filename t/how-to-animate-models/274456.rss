    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-animate-models/274456</link>
    <description>First, You will need these plugins. Follow MrPotatoHead&#39;s Tutorial on how to add them.

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354287.0.html

If you dont already, you need a registered version of Metasequoia.
Heres the serial.
Click &#39;Help&#39;, then &#39;Registration&#39;, then enter the serial.

[code]serial 372A39-2132
password j1eT-W2NR-Br04

serial 4C6A3w-699F
password gs31-cCDb-3TdO

serial 7436Bj-50E3
password jxhg-GUDx-wruX

Thanks SilentCJ for serial.

Once you have it registered, and have the plugins in the correct place, open  &#39;chara.mqo&#39; in the sample file. The sample file comes with the plugins.

Make sure you have basic mode off.

Now, in the commands, click the japanese button. and you should see this.

On the bottom of your screen, you will see a &#39;play&#39; button, click it. Pretty cool, but we are going to make it animated how you want it.

Now, on the bottom of your screen, you will see some blue lines, use your arrow keys to move the white rectangle on it, and delete them, delete them by clicking the delete button once on the blue line. (The white rectangle has the number in it, and every time you move it, it increases, or decreases by 1.)
The picture below points to were the blue lines are, and were you see the &#39;3&#39;, thats the white rectangle.

Now, your little character should be in the christ position, and you will see that there are no more blue lines! Put your white rectangle on 0, like shown in the picture below.

Now, heres the fun part, you are going to make it animate how you want it to.
While the white rectangle it on 0, you will see these little squares on the character.

[img]http://img145.imageshack.us/img145/3104/90436700.png[/img]

Click, and hold the square, and move it were you want the piece to be. I moved the arm.

Now, go to the next frame, by presing the right arrow button, and repeat the step were you move the arm.

Do that frame, by frame, and you have your own animation!
Click the play button, and see your work.

Hope this Tutorial helped.</description>
