    <title>How To Guide... Port Fowarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-guide-port-fowarding/92422</link>
    <description>I have noticed that many people need help Port Fowarding.
If you need help, and you don&#39;t know what the hell to do go to
http://portforward.com/ .
                                  [b]Port Foward[/b]
 Internet users have difficulty getting to work through their router or firewall. These guides are provided to help you, but we are in no way responsible for the state of your network. 

                                  [b]Securing Your Wireless Network[/b]
 When setting up a wireless network, it is important to turn on as much security as you can for that network. The security settings in most routers are confusing. You can Mess with you firewall. You can go into your router and make sure eveything is in the correct order that you would like it to be.

                                 [b]Port Fowarding With Linksys[/b]
This is a very easy way to portfoward. Type in your Ip address in your address bar using the Internet.
You will have to have a Username/password. Leave the username blank and type &quot;admin&quot; for the password.
Okay, lets say you don&#39;t know your ip. Go to http://whatismyip.com/.
Okay you have it up, go to Applications &amp; Gaming&gt;Port Range Forward. Your Applaction can be the name of your Server. So let&#39;s put pur3pkscape. Then were it says start to end, put the port of your server.
5555 to 5555. Then your Protocol would be TCP. Then of course, your IP adress should already be in there, to finish it off, check the box and save.

              <p>nohope, what type of westell router do you use? I use a Westell 327W, With at&amp;t/bellsouth.  If you tell me what model it is, I can probably run through with you on how to do it.</p>
