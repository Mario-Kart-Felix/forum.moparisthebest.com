    <title>Need help with Dodian! :P</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-dodian-p/172028</link>
    <description>Ok I have a small problem with ub3r 3.0. I don&#39;t have it :&#39;(. It seems to me like all the download links are dead. I was hoping someone with and unedited ub3r 3.0 (with mysql) might take it upon themselves to upload a new one. Please :)</description>
