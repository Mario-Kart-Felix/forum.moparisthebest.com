    <title>Exploiting parallelism in handling game server simulation logic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exploiting-parallelism-in-handling-game-server-simulation-logic/417535</link>
    <description>i know this problem has existed for quite a while and there have been a few discussions over it but i&#39;ve been thinking more and more about it as i&#39;ve studied code from darkstar, reddwarf, dimdwarf, app engine, and plenty of articles in regards to distributed game server architectures.

in general a server will handle game logic tasks / dispatch game logic events in a single-thread which implicitly locks state during each task. this effectively prevents you from parallelising such tasks because as mentioned before consistency issues become easily apparent if you consider two tasks handling attacking a player executing concurrently and modifying the same data. this is to prevent unintentional concurrency [b]contentions[/b], especially [b]race conditions[/b]. two tasks that modify the same data provide internal inconsistency to the client. this is called [i]pessimistic concurrency control[/i].

as should also be very simple to realize, some tasks *can* be parallelized with no negative effects. example, a task that moves a player can easily be run concurrently with another task that moves another player (well, if you manage them in lists per tile then you&#39;d hope that you aren&#39;t sharing tiles between players). there is no need for parallelism here because they do not share any data and therefore do not have any issues. you could try to run [b]all[/b] tasks in parallel and hope for the best. in case of inconsistencies, one could check for concurrent modification before committing any changes to the shared game state (the domain objects that compose the server-side world model). obviously you incur penalties if an inconsistency is found, however it can perform much better than the pessimistic alternative. this is known as [i]optimistic concurrency control[/i].

the last choice is a hybrid of the two, executing most in a serial, single-thread ordered manner, while concurrently executing tasks which do not cause inconsistency issues in parallel. this is known as [i]semi-optimistic concurrency control[/i]. a popular example suggested originally by blakeman8192 and subsequently implemented by several users here employs parallelism only in the case of preparing client update events. such tasks [b]share nothing[/b] and therefore can be safely run in parallel, while running everything else in a serial single-threaded manner. usually one picks a type of concurrency control for every task when developing it. this may seem to be premature optimization at first although in some situations can provide the benefits of optimistic and pessimistic concurrency controls without their respective pitfalls.

the way to look at accessing the shared game domain objects is as being stored in an in-memory database shared among tasks. modifications are done via transactions which are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable -- that is, they are ACID compliant. in a model where you have a cluster of machines handling game logic tasks, you can keep an object store (in darkstar/reddwarf it&#39;s backed by berkeley databases in high-availability mode that replicate on every node. dimdwarf however uses a custom in-memory shared-nothing object store (think distributed hash tables) which needs no redundant replication) and tasks manage transactions involving the game domain object database.

i realize this post is really long and not particularly organized however i hope i opened a door to community discussion on something useful.</description>

              <p>i know this problem has existed for quite a while and there have been a few discussions over it but i’ve been thinking more and more about it as i’ve studied code from darkstar, reddwarf, dimdwarf, app engine, and plenty of articles in regards to distributed game server architectures.</p>
<p>in general a server will handle game logic tasks / dispatch game logic events in a single-thread which implicitly locks state during each task. this effectively prevents you from parallelising such tasks because as mentioned before consistency issues become easily apparent if you consider two tasks handling attacking a player executing concurrently and modifying the same data. this is to prevent unintentional concurrency <span class="bbcode-b">contentions</span>, especially <span class="bbcode-b">race conditions</span>. two tasks that modify the same data provide internal inconsistency to the client. this is called <span class="bbcode-i">pessimistic concurrency control</span>.</p>
<p>as should also be very simple to realize, some tasks <em>can</em> be parallelized with no negative effects. example, a task that moves a player can easily be run concurrently with another task that moves another player (well, if you manage them in lists per tile then you’d hope that you aren’t sharing tiles between players). there is no need for parallelism here because they do not share any data and therefore do not have any issues. you could try to run <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> tasks in parallel and hope for the best. in case of inconsistencies, one could check for concurrent modification before committing any changes to the shared game state (the domain objects that compose the server-side world model). obviously you incur penalties if an inconsistency is found, however it can perform much better than the pessimistic alternative. this is known as <span class="bbcode-i">optimistic concurrency control</span>.</p>
<p>the last choice is a hybrid of the two, executing most in a serial, single-thread ordered manner, while concurrently executing tasks which do not cause inconsistency issues in parallel. this is known as <span class="bbcode-i">semi-optimistic concurrency control</span>. a popular example suggested originally by blakeman8192 and subsequently implemented by several users here employs parallelism only in the case of preparing client update events. such tasks <span class="bbcode-b">share nothing</span> and therefore can be safely run in parallel, while running everything else in a serial single-threaded manner. usually one picks a type of concurrency control for every task when developing it. this may seem to be premature optimization at first although in some situations can provide the benefits of optimistic and pessimistic concurrency controls without their respective pitfalls.</p>
<p>the way to look at accessing the shared game domain objects is as being stored in an in-memory database shared among tasks. modifications are done via transactions which are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable – that is, they are ACID compliant. in a model where you have a cluster of machines handling game logic tasks, you can keep an object store (in darkstar/reddwarf it’s backed by berkeley databases in high-availability mode that replicate on every node. dimdwarf however uses a custom in-memory shared-nothing object store (think distributed hash tables) which needs no redundant replication) and tasks manage transactions involving the game domain object database.</p>
<p>i realize this post is really long and not particularly organized however i hope i opened a door to community discussion on something useful.</p>
