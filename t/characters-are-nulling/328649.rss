    <title>Characters are nulling</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/characters-are-nulling/328649</link>
    <description>Alright I searched everywhere, but nowhere have I found a solution to this problem. 

Basically, everytime my old players try to login they cant move and the login message spams until they are disconnected. This is including my main owner account. If i create a new account it works fine, but any account that was existing when this problem happened is messed up. 

I also found that if I made a new account that was working fine, but then added one of the nulled accounts to my friends list the new account would start nulling.

I tried saving the character files in a separate folder, deleting all the ones in the server files, then replacing them with the saved ones, but the same thing started happening agian. 


I really have no idea what the hell is going on, and some help here would be GREATLY appreciated.</description>

<p>Make sure they are using the correct client that co-respawns to that source so it doesnt mess up. If it still happens meaby either the source or client has an error/bug. Try compiling and if it has an error fix it.</p>
