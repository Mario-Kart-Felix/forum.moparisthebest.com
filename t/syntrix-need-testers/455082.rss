    <description>[center]Hello,

I am working on my server &quot;Syntrix&quot;,
it has pretty much perfect combat,everything
redone and stuff but just need to work on a 
few things to make it perfect for release.

I am looking for a good developer who can add perfect summoning with specials .

If the server is ready to launch I will be investing
over 500 usd in promotionals &amp; banners . Also
planning to pay the developer good with monthly payments.

Contact me with skype or a pm on here .
