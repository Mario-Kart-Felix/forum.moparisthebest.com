    <title>Yahoo! security questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/yahoo-security-questions/515652</link>
    <description>Every time I try and log into my account, it asks me to answer my security questions which I do not know.  So pretty much I do not know my security questions, I do not have an other email address connected to the account, and I do not have a phone number connected to the account.  Wat do?  I cannot get any help on the Yahoo! site, do they have a support email or some other type of support that actually works, because the ones I tried didn&#39;t?</description>

<p>Just try and find a loop hole around having to answer the question, if it only just started asking for the answers then try deleting your cookies or something. Request a new password and hopefully when you click the activation link it will allow you to have access to the account settings where you can modify the question or something. Other than that I really wouldn’t have much of a clue, so good luck bud, you’re going to need it.</p>

              <p>Guess the answer or contact them for support through a different email or phone if possible. Unless you have some sort of auto fill option that writes down things like that for you then just see if you can find it or something. I cannot stress the importance of having a back-up email or phone number, I’m surprised you didn’t even have a question you knew.</p>
<p>Other than that, there is nothing left to do. Legally</p>
