    <title>Decrypting account .dat files?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decrypting-account-dat-files/282218</link>
    <description>Hi google!

I read on another forum that it is possible to decrypt the account data files that Runescape stores in &quot;C:\WINDOWS\.jagex_cache_32\&quot;.

So, I&#39;ve searched around and can&#39;t seem to find it. Could anyone point me in the right direction?

Thanks!</description>

Sounds very plausible indeed. Storing whether or not the account is flagged client side prevents the overhead of sending unnecessary monitoring information via packets.</p>
<p>I’m going to guess that the routine to decipher this information is stored in the “js5” format and loaded into the virtual machine at runtime. That’s probably why so few people have access to this information. In fact, I’m going to guess even further and say that this is what semaphore was referring to in a previous post saying that he told everyone RS was flagging accounts and nobody believed him. If I were more curious about this, I would intercept the point at which the final bytecode is loaded into the JVM at runtime and output it to a file.</p>
<p>Rather than deleting the .dat, it would be far better to emulate the encryption method, and store an unflagged version. This would effectively disable any enhanced monitoring routines in the client. You could do that, or track each monitoring routine down one by one and disable it… I would go with the former.</p>
<p>Anyway, those are just my guesses, but what do I know? I’m sure the first 4 informative replies to this thread are far more helpful.<br>

Jagex does ‘flag’ certain accounts and has been for a very long time (at least since about version 330 (year 2005) or so).  I’m not sure about what happens now, but back then when you were flagged the client sent all of your mouse move and click information to the server for who knows what kind of analysis, presumably to detect if you are a human or a bot.  I remember when using Aryan that if you botted after you were flagged, you would be banned shortly.  So what that guy said is not complete bullshit, except the ‘report’ stuff, because he is just guessing about all of that.<br>
