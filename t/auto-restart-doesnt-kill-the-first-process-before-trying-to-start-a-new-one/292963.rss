    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/auto-restart-doesnt-kill-the-first-process-before-trying-to-start-a-new-one/292963</link>
    <description>when i use auto restart(used many different varients, tried on a diff computer and it works on there) when it restarts it doesnt stop the first one so it says the ports already in use cause it is. it wont stop the first thing



like the first server stays open the original. when the time comes for it to be restarted it cant close the first server. :/</description>
