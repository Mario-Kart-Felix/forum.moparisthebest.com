<p>When your portfowarding threw your modem, do you have the TCP/UDP on both, or do you have one separate portfoward for each?</p>
<p>Also go to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> and see if it works on your port, and on top of that run your server, and then do it again to see if it opened the port.[/quote]<br>
Never use <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a>. That site only says if a port is open when something is broadcasting on the open port.<br>
Let me find a link real fast.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,590760.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,590760.0.html</a><br>
That should help.</p>

<p>Okay let me brake it down for you:</p>
<p>Have the TCP/UDP on different ports on 43594.<br>
Then dont portfoward using the 192.0.0.1 (Your IP …).<br>
When you go to <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a>, use that given IP to portfoward.<br>
Also <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> will not catch your port, unless you have your server running.<br>
Also when you have all that dealt with, make sure that you allow the port threw your firewall.<br>
Also for that make sure you have 2 different exceptions threw firewall both TCP &amp; UDP.<br>
Have it your server name and put running on port 43594.<br>
Then on <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> should catch everything perfectly.<br>
[/quote] didnt work but i managed to find the problem i just had to enable port triggering … thnx tho</p>

<p>Okay, the ip your to portfoward, is it the 192.0.?.? or are you using the ip that <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> is giving, because I was having the same error with that 192 ip, but then when I switched it to the given ip on canyouseeme my server started working, also if your trying to check on canyouseeme, first try running your server and then run the test on the site.[/quote] idk what you mean at this point … ,</p>

hi, i tried portforwarding and it didn’t work, i tried and i did successfully change my ip to static, so and then i tried enabling DMZ and put my ip in DMZ and saved everything , and also portforwarded to 43594, and tcp and udp both protocols, and start 43594 end 43594, …etc…<br>
and its still not working , whatever i try it just doesn’t seem to work really need help on this<br>
i will be more than happy to give rsgp as a reward if you guys cannot help for free then i understand …</p>
<p>add me on skype: ( mamali.tahamtan ) (canada) or msn: ( <a href="mailto:mamalibbm@hotmail.com">mamalibbm@hotmail.com</a> ) to contact me please or just comment below thankyou very much <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>They Make PortFowarding So hard… but its so easy. look okey …<br>
1st: go To Cmd,<br>
2:Type IpConfig/All<br>
3: Scroll Down To U See Your Ip : EXAMPLE : 192.168.1 Take that Then Go To . 192.1.1 Ur Router Login, Then Scroll down to .<br>
Portfowarding.<br>
All u do from here is take, Port 4359,<br>
and make your own new portfoward by.<br>
typing server name.<br>
then put port 43594 &lt; starting , end so both spots,<br>
then simply go back to ur Ipconfig/all put that ip directly in :)))))[/quote] i have done that … doesn’t work mate</p>
