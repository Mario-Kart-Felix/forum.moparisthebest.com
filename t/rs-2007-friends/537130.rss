    <description>Hey guys whats up, before I go on this is strictly RS 2007, I do not play EoC or the newer version of RS. I&#39;m looking for people who still actually play RS 2007 because I want to get back into it but my problem is I have absoloutly nobody to play it with. And lets face facts, it isn&#39;t like it was in the old days where a lot of people were playing so you could just go out in the world and meet people. It&#39;s hard to find mature people to play the game with so anybody who is interested, just shoot me a PM when im online or something.
