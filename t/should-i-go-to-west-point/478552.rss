<p>WWII is a war with so many mistakes from both the Allies and Axis. If US, USSR, UK and France had worked together we wouldn’t have seen as big of an disaster. But they didn’t. So I won’t really give anyone much praise for the war effort. Everyone just responded when the Axis-force hit them.</p>
<p>But except for WWII, which near everyone except for Switzerland, Sweden and Spain joined, what honourable war did US fight?</p>

You do know the military is a very valid and common career choice? Most people don’t even go in to actually fight (computers/IT, science, engineering, translation, etcetcetc), but when dumbass politicians start shit they endup being sent over there. We support them out of respect, they don’t want to actually be there.</p>

<p>World war II would have eventually landed on us, Hitler had plans for Japan to invade the westcoast and Germany to invade the east coast IIRC, Pearl Harbor was to provoke us into going overseas so the US would have less defense.</p>
<p>Then all the shitty wars against communism</p>
<p>And now its just against extremists but obviously that doesn’t work</p>

It makes you the bad guys when you sign up for it.  You know what the military does, you know that it <span class="bbcode-b">weakens</span> national security in its operations overseas.</p>
<p>casey.:<br>
It is no doubt, you did a good job against the British in 1775 and 1812, do you have any other examples of defending your country from bad guys?</p>

If they don’t want their sons and daughters home in caskets, they should stop sending them into<br>

<p>There is no need for more people into the military. So you cannot argue that you protect your country by joining.</p>

<p>I refuse to let anyone ever insult our military. We can all agree that the US expresses some fascistic commonalities, but at the end of the day, soldiers are still fighting to represent and protect our past and present soldiers and civilians and ideals. Of course you can bring in the argument of “What is the point of pride in nationality” but  the military is still representing our countries roots.</p>
<p>We have members on this site who are currently enlisted and I’m sure everyone has a family or friendship tie to someone in the military and will agree on this. We support the men and women defending and representing the true values of America, not the puppets and puppeteers who tell them what to do.</p>

Granted you have to serve time back to the military for your education, you are guaranteed a job and 2nd level rank upon graduation.</p>
