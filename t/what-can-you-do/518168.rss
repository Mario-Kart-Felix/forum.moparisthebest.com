    <title>What can you do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-can-you-do/518168</link>
    <description>Hey there folks. I haven&#39;t made an moparscape private server in a while. I believe I was missing a few things. So I was just wondering if you guys could link me to a few tutorials and answer some questions of mine. First question, can I make areas in the game? Second, as costumizaton. How far can I go with that, in most part graphics. How far can I upgrade those for MoparScape. Thanks every one for your time and effort.</description>
