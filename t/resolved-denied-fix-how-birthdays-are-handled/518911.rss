    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] Fix how birthdays are handled</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-fix-how-birthdays-are-handled/518911</link>
    <description>Right now, it&#39;s basically if someone has a friend who has an upcoming birthday, or someone (they think is) popular, they will make them a thread. This makes some people feel left out for no apparent reason, but also clutters up the general [u]DISCUSSION[/u] board.

Possible solutions:
1. Have clear boundaries about who can be made a birthday thread. Base it on post count and date last active for example, and everyone who fits the criteria gets one.
2. &quot;Birthdays of the week&quot; or &quot;birthdays of the month&quot;. Consolidate the birthdays in some way. I thought the thread that we had was fine, everyone got their bit of attention in the title when it was their birthday and a bump, but apparently that&#39;s not good enough.
3. Forget the stupid birthday threads altogether and let people that actually care just PM the person.
4. Any other ideas?</description>

[/quote]Or you could give mods less work so they don’t have to keep locking threads when someones birthday is over</p>
<p>None of my ideas involve forced regulation by mods at all, just changes the way the community honors birthdays. Most communities don’t create threads for birthdays, it’s just a habit here that could easily be changed. If we change how it’s done, I see no reason as to why it would create more work for mods?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@eyeown</span> - For <span class="hashtag">#2</span> you would still have some sort of criteria, probably last date active</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re under the impression that if &lt; 0.002% of the population of this forum decide not to have birthday topics anymore, that everyone will magically understand this and stop doing it. Even if we made an announcement and changed the rules, I guarantee it wouldn’t stop anything. I would need to add a regulation to the staff and tell them they must now lock birthday topics mandatorily. Honestly, this is completely ridiculous. You are bringing up a debate about something as minimally important as a topic to celebrate the day someone was born. This has been debated since before you registered here and it hasn’t been changed since. It’s not going to change because there is no outstandingly good reason to do so.[/quote]And &gt; 0.002% of the population of this forum bothers to make (or even reply to) birthday threads. So yes, if they agree to not have birthday topics anymore, I do think people will stop doing it. Again, new people are not used to having birthday topics on forums. Only people that have used the forums for a while would know about the tradition. It’s only active people that bother, and active people would see the change (whatever is decided), and stop doing it. Here’s a list of the users that made others birthday topics in the past year (could be missing a few if they used a strange title):</p>
<p><code>Runewings317
Classic
Lin
Kodiak
Arham 4
Loveandpower
Riipiinftw

</code></p>
<p>Nobody is saying it’s a “big deal”, but you’re also exaggerating your reasoning as to why it would be such a hugeeee inconvenience to the staff team. You can’t “guarentee” anything about veteran (for the most part) users not knowing about the change. Unless we do <span class="hashtag">#3</span>, which may be more difficult to get people to hear about, but eventually would catch on. I never knew something had to be a “big deal” to be handled… <em>cough</em> </p><blockquote>No more “leaving”, “sympathy”, or “coming back” topics</blockquote>

<p>None of my ideas involve forced regulation by mods at all, just changes the way the community honors birthdays. Most communities don’t create threads for birthdays, it’s just a habit here that could easily be changed. If we change how it’s done, I see no reason as to why it would create more work for mods?</p>
<p><span class="mention">@eyeown</span> - For <span class="hashtag">#2</span> you would still have some sort of criteria, probably last date active[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re under the impression that if &lt; 0.002% of the population of this forum decide not to have birthday topics anymore, that everyone will magically understand this and stop doing it. Even if we made an announcement and changed the rules, I guarantee it wouldn’t stop anything. I would need to add a regulation to the staff and tell them they must now lock birthday topics mandatorily. Honestly, this is completely ridiculous. You are bringing up a debate about something as minimally important as a topic to celebrate the day someone was born. This has been debated since before you registered here and it hasn’t been changed since. It’s not going to change because there is no outstandingly good reason to do so.</p>

<p>We never had a problem with birthday threads before (except for about a month ago, where a lot of people had birthdays).  Other than that, there is no problem with making threads for individual people, but creating separate threads for each person is ridiculous.  Although I do admit it gets pretty damn annoying seeing the same person make threads for anyone that has a name that they recognize.</p>

<p>Why would you do this so close to my birthday? I’ve been waiting years for a shout out, and i was sure this year i would get one. The fact that you have to be friends with someone in order to get a birthday thread doesn’t make it seem unfair, it encourages forum relations. If people wanted their birthday acknowledges by members of the community, then they would do something more then just sit around and wait for a thread to be made for them. I believe that having a birthday thread made for you proves you’ve been significant enough to be recognised, be that to the community or two a few select members. I don’t think a cap should be put on birthday threads, or and change in it as it doesn’t harm anyone, at some points people have made their own birthday threads. What stops a person from posting heir own happy birthday? Harry Potter did it, why can’t they? Silly.</p>

<p>Your birthdays not on your profile that’s why you probably haven’t gotten one o.o.</p>
