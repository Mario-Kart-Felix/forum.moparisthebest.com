    <title>People can&#39;t join anymore</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-cant-join-anymore/161294</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t used my No-Ip in a while and I haven&#39;t used my server for a while and now when people try to get on... They can&#39;t. I tried making a new No-Ip using a new E-Mail and a new Port Fowarding address and I also deleted No-Ip and downloaded it again. EVERYTHING ELSE [b]IS[/b] PERFECT but now people can&#39;t join my server and when I try register it on the internet, it says that the server is offline.


[b] I REPEAT, EVERYTHING IS FINE EXCEPT FOR THE NO-IP. [/b]

Any help please? :]</description>
