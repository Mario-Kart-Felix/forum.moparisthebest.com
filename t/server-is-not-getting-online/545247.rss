    <title>Server is not getting online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-is-not-getting-online/545247</link>
    <description>I have this problem and I have no clue whats up. I&#39;m almost 100% sure I did everything right, but whenever I go to check if my server is online, it always saids offline.
I have no-ip , I portforwarded my router with the port 43594, I have the ipv4 correct, but it seems not to work. I even tried to portforward with UTorrent and it didn&#39;t work. So if you have any idea on how to fix this issue, can you please reply or skype me at &quot;lukersps&quot; or even pm me over here.
Thank you .</description>
