              <p>This goes 1 of two ways, <span class="hashtag">#1</span> either you have something in server-side or client-side that’s keeping it there as in it saves ur username and password (like a website for example) so just find where it is and take it off. <span class="hashtag">#2</span> If this is not the case, I’d try looking at your Sprites, etc to see if you’re missing a loginbox or create a new one to see if that gets rid of it.</p>
