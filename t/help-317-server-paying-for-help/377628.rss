    <title>Help 317 Server, Paying £££ For Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-317-server-paying-for-help/377628</link>
    <description>I Downloaded &quot;Denise Pking V5&quot; Recently, I Extracted And Ran Source, Had A Look Around..
I Need Help On The Following Problems:

1. Save User&#39;s Account, I.E (When I Log In And Get 99 Stats And Items, When I Log Out Again It Resets To 1 And Nothing In Bank.)

2. Move NPC&#39;s.

3. Sort The Item Thing Out, E.g ::Item 4561 3 (I Want Only Admin&#39;s To Be Able To Do That)

4. Once An User Logs In They Will Instantly Have 200m Of Items, I Only Want Users To Have 5 Sets Of Everything Which Is Already In Bank

Anyone Who Can Solve The Following Will Be Rewarded, With Auto-Admin + £30

Many Thanks.
