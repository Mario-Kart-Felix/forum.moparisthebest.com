    <description>You&#39;ve decded to look at my project thread. Let me give you a quick run-down on what it is. I am attempting to make a unique, custom, profile site where you can actually be you. With no gimmicks or blocks in the way. It will not be a social site, but meerly a webpage creation site (so to say) that can auto generate your profile for you, with the required data inserted to some text fields. Or you can go and make your own from scratch using any of the avalible web languages.

What is to be done:
Image uploader and Blur maker.
Forums (easy).
Improved logo.
All Webpages (Home[Needs some information and such], Donations [This is a temporary page till the site gets on its feet], Public Profiles [Will be tricky, as it will need auto generated information and a snap shot of the profile], Forums [Will be using SMF till we get a stable income], About [Just explains why we are here and such]).
Sleek looking design.
Auto generation of profile (if you decide to use a pre-made template).
Templates(^^)
Auto-Generated Mobile Profile [If You do not wish to make one yourself](Thanks to Loveandpower for the idea).
Free/Paid system. (Buying a profile page would get you lots more perks)

---------------------

What I need help with:
I really need some help with creating some templates. I don&#39;t know how to organize this, so you might be confused on what it is I need done. If you would like to help, ask or pm me. I&#39;ll try to fill you in as much as possible.
I Also would really like to get the image up-loader working and able to blur, as it will be a key feature for the site.
Any other help/Tips is greatly appreciated.

The &quot;Public Profiles&quot; button is the color it is because it is active, or hovered. I used jQuery and JavaScript to set up the nav bar to my liking. [The logo was made in 5 minutes, and needs to be re-done. If your willing to, please tell me so, I&#39;ll give you dimensions.]

Please No flamming or hatred on this thread. If you support me, woohoo, if not, don&#39;t bash on me. If you have any questions or comments please post below or pm me. I&#39;ll be active mainly on this thread so I&#39;ll get around to it.

<p>English DUHH. Kidding, well it definitely won’t be just one. There is no way HTML5 can auto generate pages. I believe PHP, Javascript, HTML(5), CSS, and maybe Python should do it.</p>
<p>[quote=“Samih1996, post:6, topic:454074”]I think you firstly need to design this site and polish it up all nicely and make sure it is user friendly. Secondly, I think that the list you have made is not really well taught through. You should get a pen and paper and write down all your ideas about how it could be better. Thirdly, If you want to create a system where people can ‘user generate’ own webpages instead of ‘topics’ you will need to know PHP.</p>

You need to understand that this website is in it’s early beta stages. It takes time to improve things. Do you think Apple came out in a day the way it is now? Did Adam and Eve decide to eat the all knowing food in one day? No. Everything takes time.  And I said the topics were for the beginning stages. Not for the end. This site hasn’t even been uploaded yet. How do you even know what I’ve accomplished?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So you’re creating a social networking site?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Nope. I for one hate social networking sites. It’s a website for people to join the forums, to talk normally and discuss features of their profiles and what to do better/change, and to host a 100% custom profile. Take MeetMe, Facebook, Google+, and even Myspace for example. All of them force you to have specific things on your profile. MeetMe, being unique, allows you to edit custom CSS (sarcastic “woo”) which allows you to move or hid elements and change some colors, backgrounds, few other slim things. But you can’t really ADD anything extra, like a banner, or new box, or something like that. The other sites mentioned allow nothing of the sort. Then there is IMVU (I do play it :3). The profile on there allows essentially the most freedom of all, with custom html and css being available. But you get banned for the simplest of things, like not having a couple buttons on there or removing the “block” feature. And you can’t get far on making a profile on there unless you know how to enable the sandbox. This is where my site comes in. You would sign up and upload your index, images, or what ever (limits would be in effect). Then you choose features like “public or private” and the blur image thing and other stuff. Public or private would just be there to ask if you will allow me to show your page link, and a snapshot, on the “Public Profiles” page. If set to private you may link it where ever, and we will not invade your privacy except to check up on photos (we being the staff of the site.).<br>
Does this clear things up?</p>
