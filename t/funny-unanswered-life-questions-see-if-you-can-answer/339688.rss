<li>Because its a dairy product, and will go bad eventually.</li>
<li>Because Chile is derived from a Spanish word, so why should the english definition of a homonym to the word be important at all.</li>
<li>Because Babies have nothing to care about in there simple lives, also i doubt a baby wets itself and cries while asleep. Personally if i had to piss bad i would think id wake up.</li>

<li>There is a difference between sour cream and moldy cream.</li>
<li>It is called that because you use chilli peppers in them, which are then named after the country. But you can eat it cold too.</li>
<li>Because babies after a while tend to sleep a lot and can be quiet.</li>
<li>That is the name they gave it?</li>
<li>Teflon only coats the pan, it does not ‘stick to it’. If you tried hard enough you could also get food to stick to it.</li>
<li>Why are they called “apartments” when they are all bunched together?</li>
<li>There is a difference between ‘wreckless’ and ‘reckless’.</li>
<li>Because people that aren’t effected might want to know about them?</li>
<li>Check <a href="http://dictionary.com">dictionary.com</a>
</li>
<li>It’s the law.</li>
<li>Miss Silabsoft answered this stupid question.</li>
<li>They would probably  stop the performance and call an ambulance?</li>
<li>Because boxers used to brawl in circles drawn on the ground with chalk, called a ‘ring’. The name is still used.</li>
