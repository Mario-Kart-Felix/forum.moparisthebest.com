    <title>Nicked sub cone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nicked-sub-cone/289910</link>
    <description>Ok so me and a friend are building a box for his 18&quot;s and we went to test to see if they would fit and we noticed some how while one was sitting the cone got nicked. about 7 inches from the center of the woofer, it doesn&#39;t go all the way through just like the top layer of the woofer part is scratched or something, is it fucked...? If it is going to harm it to use it, could we put a drop of gorilla glue in the mark? that stuff seems like it could withstand anything and might make the woofer solid again ...

Edit: Well we just tested it, and it looked like it might be ok, still not sure though because half way to circle K the system shut down and the amp went into protection mode... not sure why at the moment, assuming one of the wires is touching inside the box...</description>

That is how rock and roll was discovered, a blues band was driving to sun studios in Memphis, TN, when their amp fell off the top of thier car busting the cone.  They decided to cut a record anyway and propped the cone up with some newspaper, this was the first use of distortion in music and therefore considered by most people to be the first rock and roll song.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the interesting fact haha.</p>
