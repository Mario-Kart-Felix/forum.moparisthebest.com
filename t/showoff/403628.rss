    <description>Wasn&#39;t quite sure where to post this, Moderators please feel free to delete,move or do what ever with this if it&#39;s in the wrong place.
I noticed alot of discussion around the Show-Off Board Vote topic.
Just a suggestion, But couldn&#39;t you just post it in General Discussion with [b][Showoff] Content here [Showoff][/b]. In my opinion it would work for those for and against the idea of the Show-Off Board.</description>

<p>Nothing changes here. It’s the same thing everyday, and anything that does want to get changed needs to be pushed to ridiculous measures to be even considered. Adding a new section isn’t turning this into a different community. It’s offering more opportunities to the people who are in the community.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@MITB</span>, consider the fact that if we take all the people that voted and left feedback, we would be 2/3, but a lot of MITB’s people come here and vote no, and leave. The vote was a stupid idea in the first place, as it wouldn’t matter anyway.</p>

The majority matters in most instances, but not a simple majority, it should be at least 2/3rds or something meaningful.</p>

<p>Yeah, but child-boards get filled up with crap as-well. I still think [Showoff] will be satisfactory[/quote]We could have already done that, without making our new rules. This whole Showoff thing started spam in the General Discussion section.</p>
