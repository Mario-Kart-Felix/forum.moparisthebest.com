This probably isn&#39;t as old school as most of you know, pre-2007. This is pretty old though considering what is now up and running. I use to run this server in 09/10 and it usually had around 300+ online. It was pretty huge on RL&#39;s toplist and had a good thing going until [I]shit just happened.[/I] It averages around 10-20 online and is pretty community oriented. The only people that play right are all vets that played back then. If you&#39;re looking for a new, sorta old, and a close community then this is probably a good choice for you. The newest thing you will find is dragon claws, skillcape emotes, and that&#39;s pretty much it. This won&#39;t always remain old as times goes on, but I won&#39;t add any extremely new content. The only thing that will be added is a fewer newer items, npcs, and just updates on older content. I don&#39;t want this to be known as some shitty, buggy, and poorly ran 600+ server. Thanks for reading and hope you give it a try :p

The owners are Bizerk, Adam, and Ballin. I&#39;m just posting this on here as a member of the server :)

<p>Also, what your server could do to make your self more professional is to have taken this minor argument to pm. I mean, let’s be honest nobody reading this thread wants to see a huge argument about abuse. It can’t be good for the server.</p>

I’m a admin on the server.</p>
<ol>
<li>You were advertising a RS2 remake and had the name of the one you were advertising. I’d post it but its censored to say ‘google’ here.</li>
<li>You tried to act smart and ask why people were calling you names when it was very obvious. Would you like if it if I spammed your server?</li>
</ol>
<p>You were ipbanned because of the advertising because it was obvious that was the only thing you were there for. Don’t try to give the server a bad rep when the owners have logs of this going on.</p>

<p>I believe if you take part of wanting to advertise for another person rather let him do it himself, you attempt to do it correctly and give the community a good-name, from what I can see from your post, I don’t think you’re doing just that, actually I would think it would resemble a “shit” community as you are attempting to say about his “server”.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m not here to do that, good luck again, just learn to respect others when doing something like this.</p>

<p>This probably isn’t as old school as most of you know, pre-2007. This is pretty old though considering what is now up and running. I use to run this server in 09/10 and it usually had around 300+ online. It was pretty huge on RL’s toplist and had a good thing going until <span class="bbcode-i">shit just happened.</span> It averages around 10-20 online and is pretty community oriented. The only people that play right are all vets that played back then. If you’re looking for a new, sorta old, and a close community then this is probably a good choice for you. The newest thing you will find is dragon claws, skillcape emotes, and that’s pretty much it. This won’t always remain old as times goes on, but I won’t add any extremely new content. The only thing that will be added is a fewer newer items, npcs, and just updates on older content. I don’t want this to be known as some shitty, buggy, and poorly ran 600+ server. Thanks for reading and hope you give it a try <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
