    <description>Hey guys , I&#39;m new to the community , but I&#39;m trying to find a team that will make and run a great rsps server. I personally believe its 50% material and 50% community that runs a server, so that being said.

I&#39;m looking for a
-coder (the source and client is a 317)
-1 admin , who can play quite a bit daily. ( to keep everything under control)
-Client/coder Someone whos good with portforwarding and creating a downloadable file
-2 mods who can host events and play more than 4 hours daily

I&#39;m not sure if I wrote in the right format , but I&#39;m hoping to find a successful staff. :)</description>
