    <description>Any of those who need help with....Hamachi

First of all&gt;&gt;&gt;

[center][b]Hamachi[/b][/center]

Right first to get hamachi we need to download it! To download hamachi click[url=http://www.hamachi.cc/download/]Here[/url] this may take a while but now we have it you will start hamachi by looking to the bottem right hand side of your screen on your bottem toolbar, you will see one triangle with 3 circles, right click the triangle and click power on! Now you will find that a box will come up, you can choose a nickname!

Now you will see a grey box with three circle buttons on the bottem of this grey box, Keep your mouse over one until it says &quot;Create or join network&quot; Now you have found this click it and you can either join or create a network, if you want to join a server please click join network, you should know the information  such as what network and what the password is!

Now all you need to do is find the ip for the server, ([i]This will be next to the owner in the hamachi networks name)[/i] ENJOY!

For those who cannot get hamachi back up and if you try to download it says hamachi is already been spotted on your computer, would you like an update? This is an all favourite problem, first to get hamachi back up go to &quot;my computer&quot; in the start panel and hit ctrl+f and it should come up a box on the left hand side, click search all files and folders, type hamachi in both boxes that will come up and what to search? search computer! You will see all these things come up for the search results, click the folder and it will come up stuff like uninstall etc, click on &quot;hamachi&quot; and then it will come up in the middle of your screen, &quot;hamachi starting&quot; or something  ;D

Now do this everytime you can&#39;t find hamachi on the bottem of your screen¬

~~End of Hamachi~~
