    <description>MulahCraft - Get Rich or Die Tryin&#39; - Diamond and comment to receive $250 in-game.
MulahCraft is a survival server that allows a player to join with $250 and make much more money by joining a job and becoming rich. Selling your goods either to the shop or to others. Set your own home where ever you would like by typing /sethome. Privately lock all chest / furnace / doors and signs. Feel Completely safe when you own you land and have all items stored in chest. Killing is allowed, but if you live in the city, killing id disabled, so buying a lot in the city you&#39;ll be away from PvP.

  - MobArena
      - Tag Team Together and make it far in MobArena to make tons of Mulah!
      - Suggest New Ideas to Admins!

  - MineReset
     - This plugin allows you to go to the public mine and find varies of ores anywhere in the area.
      - It is public, so finding ores may be slighlty more difficult than normal

  - Owning/Buying/Rent/Bid Land
     - You can own as much land as you want if you simply have the money to do so.
