    <description>I&#39;ve noticed that for the past 2 years or so, people aren&#39;t judged on their overall stats, but for their banks.  I don&#39;t really get it, how is someone that worked for years to get 10+ 99s worse than a level 70 that diced for 2 months and made 5b?

[/quote]<br>
but you don’t you can irc dice or flower game to make the bank, the reason noone gives a shit about stats anymore is because everyone already has stats.[/quote]</p>
<p>I honestly couldn’t find the game fun having money but having shitty stats. You can get buy able stats sure, but you can’t get combat and others.</p>

I don’t really get it, how is someone that worked for years to get 10+ 99s worse than a level 70 that diced for 2 months and made 5b?</p>
<p>Witch do you think matters more?[/quote]<br>
2 years? a few months? they’re both dirty newfags to me.</p>

I thought this topic was about judging people as RS players, not judging how their stats are beneficial.  If you make 1b mining, you’re a better RS player than if you make 1b staking.  That’s my opinion.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I do agree to this.  My point, though, was that people with all 99s and 100m are called noobs, while people with 99 cooking and a phat set are practically worshiped by ‘lower’ players.[/quote]<br>
Well I hope if you have all 99’s you would’ve made more than 100m.  And yes, that’s wrong unless ofcourse the 99 cooking guy picked flax or filled vials or something for his party hat set.  In which case, he’s better than all 99 guy.</p>
<p>Another thing; This thread is all opinion.  So no one will ever win an argument here.</p>
