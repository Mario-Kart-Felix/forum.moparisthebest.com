    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-type-of-server-someone-should-really-make/226589</link>
    <description>Just a suggestion to anybody creating a server that will have a dedi and WILL STAY UP. this is the server that will get you the most members.
Make a server where all skills are used, like real rsc. no free pots, no free fish. make exp perfect though. not as low as rsca, not as high as some. maybe like 50x. make the economy good and make low level pking come back (like level 30s-60s) where stuff actually counts and it doesnt get boring to pk after an hour. most servers, stuff is so easy to get, you just keep going back and dont care if you die. thats not what pking is about\takes the fun out of it.
flame me if you want, this is just a suggestion to what somebody should put in a server.</description>

people will pk, if you dont think that look at rsc 99% of everyone autoed and more people pked then any of these servers, SHIT ACTUALLY COUNTED, like when you won something it actually meant something and super sets and shit all cost money that took a hit to your pocket.<br>

<p>Offical RSC is now shit. Botting on RSC back before RS2 only worked because a very small proportion of the over-all population did it, and a number of those were caught.[/quote]u do speak the truth. rsc is now shit but thats because everyones banned [including myself] from that one big ban wave like 2 years ago. i know you dont want people autoing on ur server, im just saying its going to happen. i have no idea how this conversation got into this hahaha i just wanted to give someone a suggestion of a type of server to make. and just to let u know autoing still works on rs2, im doing it right now</p>

<p>Yeah, because there were no other alternatives (servers) and it died out slowly. If there were a lot of alternatives just like now, it would have died a lot faster.</p>

              <p>if you have a replica of rsc, with working all skills and low exp rate, autoing will bring back a good healthy economy/pking/ people will play your server.<br>
think about it, imagine RSCD(origonal by reines) how many people played it, but with a lower exp rate and allowing autos.now, dont get me wrong, it would only work if you released a bot along with it because most people here have no idea how to make one.</p>

someone should make a server with a sts built into the client but with really low xp rates like 5x (isnt that what rsca is?).<br>

</aside>
<p>i would hire you but dont wanna buy a dedi and people will cry if there is a database reset and shit its totaly pointless to host a server now a days noone cares about the server all they care about are there stats say if there was a a bug in the sql file and you had to reset it like 99% of the people would quit there just dumbass’s like that</p>
