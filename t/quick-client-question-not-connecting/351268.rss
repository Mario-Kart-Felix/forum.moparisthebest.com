    <title>Quick Client Question - Not Connecting?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-client-question-not-connecting/351268</link>
    <description>I have tried and tried but I cannot figure out why when I try to connect with the CreativeScape Client to the CreativeScape Sourceit says &quot;No response From Loginserver, Please try again in 5 minutes.&quot; This happens after it downloads the Cache and you try and login. There is no connection received by the server.

But I have another source running and the client will connect to the source but log right off, proving it can connect to my IP. What is stopping it from connecting to the server?

Any help is great!! Thanks!!!</description>
