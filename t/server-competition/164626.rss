My Name Is Ashley Denham. Im Looking At Hosting A Server. On A Dedicated. (Probly Host For A Year) Or +. 24/7 Connection.
Should Be A Well Played Server. U Will Get Full Acess To THe Computer Hosting Too, Via Log Me In. Ill Also Have A Program Which You Can Buzz, Which Will Wake Me Up, Just Incase Somthing Bads Happening ^.^
Too Apply Please Reply On The Fourm With These Details!

Type Of Server? : Pk/Non PK/Skillz/Pk
Exp Rate? : E.g. 200% 
Items? : How To Get Them? Store? Rares Are Rare?
Money Making? : How Easy.. 10mill/per 2 hours? 10 seconds?

Anyways. Also Add My Msn Game_Master_Wrinkles@hotmail.com

I Would Like To Test The Servers Out That I Like The Most.  Could I Also Have A Few Pics Posted Of Your Server?
