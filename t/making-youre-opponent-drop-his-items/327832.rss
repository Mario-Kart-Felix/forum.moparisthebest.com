    <title>Making you&#39;re opponent drop his items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-youre-opponent-drop-his-items/327832</link>
    <description>Hey, I&#39;m using a source that has it set up so that every time a player dies he keeps 3 items. I&#39;ve been looking around the youdied() function but all that ive been able to do is make it so that the 3 items arent kept, but i cant seem to make the player DROP those 3 items with the correct amount he had in his inventory. I was able to get him to drop 1 of the item every time, but i found out that if i do that and somebody kills someone with more than 1 of that item in their inventory, they crash.

Can somebody explain to me how to make everybody except admins and above DROP and lose all of their items? It would really help me out.</description>
