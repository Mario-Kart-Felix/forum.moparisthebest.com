If they use reflection why the fuck are they still going through jni overhead just to use a terrible 50 year old programming language<br>
[/quote]I have no fucking idea. Actually, that question came up and people said it was for legacy reasons – learning a new language would be “too hard” or “too much time” or something. Plus, people there have a weird hate toward Java even though THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF THEIR ALMIGHTY SMART IS IN JAVA… ya</p>

Have a read of this thread if you’re interested[/quote]</p>
<p>SRL isn’t thriving to be the most efficient and up-to-date botting community, I guess you could call it vintage botting or something… Most of the scripters do it as some sort of a hobby, they know it takes about 20 lines to make a chicken killer for RSBot that buries bones and cooks the meat, but after all that’s not much fun is it? (Well, someone might argue neither is writing 500 lines for the same thing).</p>
<p>Only difference to the end-user (scripter) is the effort they’re willing to put in for the same results. Also, most of the older scripters can make quite a lot more use of their brain than the new RSBuddy scripters whose main concern is making sure their Frost Dragon killer drinks antifires in order not to get shit on, in comparison to people at SRL solving stuff like the gravedigger random entirely in color…</p>
