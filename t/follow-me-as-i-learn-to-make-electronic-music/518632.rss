    <title>Follow me as I learn to make electronic music</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/follow-me-as-i-learn-to-make-electronic-music/518632</link>
    <description>Outdated post -&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Took a break from all my classical junk and started making trance/dubstep last night

---Note #1: none of these are actual songs yet. I&#39;m approaching this as I would with any other art and dissecting the elements and then start to analyze construction. I&#39;m experimenting and putting together small excerpts for practice before attempting a full song, basically sound doodles.
---Note #2: I suck with dubstep, im more familiar with trance. The friend I&#39;m going to be partnering with will be designing the dubstep parts (I did the ones already there) but I mainly enjoy making the peaks
---Note #3: Some of these wont match up, some of the drops wont make sense but thats because id be making a trance intro and then suddenly decide ill attempt some wubs lol. I just use the project files as my sketch pad.


Please tell me what parts you like more so I can head in the right direction! I really want criticism. If you compare #1 to whatever the most recent one is you&#39;ll see what I do with advice!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>You should try a quiet section as a build up. Sort of like drop your synth and then climax into something similar to what you did at ~2:10</p>

<p>I agree that there needs to be a build up, but the release after the climax (hehe) in trance music needs to “feel” uplifting. It’s hard to explain because I’m not that much into music creation, so I can’t give clear examples or explanations about what I mean.</p>
<p>This is my favorite trance song and since it has various sections, I wonder if this might be a good example of what I mean.</p>

<p>I think the chorus on <span class="hashtag">#9</span> was one of the best ive ever done, my favorite part is 4:25+, but like I said it doesn’t have the uplifting sound I want.

              <p>For some of your synths on <span class="hashtag">#9</span>, you’re using them as really short notes, so it sounds more like house than trance. Like Si Force said, it sounds aggressive. Try to for the sound you had all the way up to ~1:15. I’d like to see what you could do by trying to put softer sounds.</p>

<p>Thanks, I’m being told my “peaks” are my strongest point.</p>
<p>And I’m working more on my instrument layering, I’ve also noticed some don’t have quite the “full” sound I want</p>
<p>I’m working on a real traditional trance song right now while I practice my beats, hoping to practice transitions quite a bit</p>
<p>[quote=“asyo4, post:25, topic:518632”]Here’s a tip: EQ every snare to around 200 HZ, it makes a great hallow-sounding snare great for glitch/dubstep.</p>
<p>“Rebel against anything” is a good example of 200 HZ EQ’ing: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mason-secreti/rebel-against-anything">https://soundcloud.com/mason-secreti/rebel-against-anything</a></p>
<p>edit: if u need any help come to me, been producing for about a year and a half now :p[/quote]<br>
I recently figured out how useful EQing is and now I pretty much do it to every instrument I load. Helps so much with overall quality and separating each instrument instead of letting their frequencies mush together</p>
<p>EDIT: Alright got another one up there, tried alot of new stuff</p>

<p>Although, I feel that you don’t have enough backing instruments to support your main synth instruments. But, they’re experiments so I’ll just leave this here.</p>
