<p>I’d be willing to do that.  I’d prefer to be able to work on the server/client though… just for fun.  But first I’d like to see if anyone else seems to agree with me.  Thanks for at least listening to my reasoning.  That’s more than what some people are able to do.</p>

        <p>The issue (imo) is that a runescape private server should not be afkable. Instead of looking at what bots do and hey they benefit players, you should understand why they are used and work around that. The moment you force the bot script makers to use logic in their script then that removes 99% of them. For example, an AI system where players have to react to wtf is going on with the npc.

<p>Why can’t magic be used to skill? So “logs to longs” spell that converts every log in your inventory automatically to longbows is one example.</p>
<p>Miniquests that give more exp than afking or botting.</p>
<p>An AI system so players actually have a challenge rather than afking npcs all the time. Sitting around for 30 minutes afking hobs is the way of the past.</p>
<p>The reason people turn to bots is due to being bored, make the game fun and you fix the problem. Then there are the assholes who just like to bot to piss people off (pvp bots)</p>

        <p>So I’ve been working on a private server…  I’ve got some spare time for the next month or so.  Here are my thoughts…</p>
<p>The pros to botting:</p>
<p>[ul][li]You can still have a life[/li]<br>
[li]Teaches some people how to program[/li]<br>
[li]The sucky parts of the game that you personally don’t enjoy you can bot.  Play the fun parts.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The cons to botting:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Botters have an unfair advantage over legit players[/li]<br>
[li]Botters ruin the economy[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>My ideas to attempt to solve the cons <span class="hashtag">#1</span> and <span class="hashtag">#2:</span><br>
The bot itself will be built into the regular client.  Everyone will have access to it to use it.  Those who are botting will have a 0.5x less experience <b>multiplier</b> than those who are playing legitly (I’m leaning towards 2-3x multiplier).  You can switch between botting and playing legit whenever you wish.  In order to bot however, you have to have “bot time”.  A new item (Bot time certificate) will be introduced to the game.  The certificate (for now) is worth 20 minutes of bot time.  They can be gained in 1 of 2 ways.</p>
<p>[ul][li]For every 5 minutes of legit play you get 1 bot time certificate.[/li]<br>
[li]You can trade for bot time certificate from other players.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The Bot time certificate can be “redeemed” (used up, consumed), and when that happens 20 minutes is added to your bot time.  Then as your botting, your bot time reduces.  If it hits 0, it’ll stop the script that’s currently running.</p>
<p>This is more of a pet project for me for the next month or so.  I’ve got a month off until I start my full time job.  I’m curious to know what others thoughts are about it.  And would anyone be interested in helping out?  Help could be simply beta testing things, gathering data from rsc, or developing if you have some significant experience.</p>
<p>Bot running around… I still need to work on the interface for selecting the script a bit more.<br>

        <p>Honestly that’d be easy to implement in a day of work, from any working codebase that I am familiar with for RSC gameservers.<br>
So, I’m curious what help you’d like or need.<br>
Also, did you just nab RSCR’s bank screen?  You should implement your own, really.  I can show you the one I’d made when I was writing a new client graphics API and shit, if you want some design ideas if you’re interested in doing that at all…<br>
EDIT: Just watched video of the botting part, you should write server-sided automation, like one automation task per player maybe, or similar, kinda like a followTick but a automationTick task.</p>

        <p>I’ve always liked playing with the idea of using NPCs to do more than just sit there for quests or combat. Why not utilize NPC’s by creating a new skill where you could “train” your NPC to do tasks for you? You could ideally create a new market for this by being able to resell these “trained” NPC’s to execute tasks for people who want them (retrieving/sending supplies to bank, or buying/selling supplies to stores/people, anything thats repetitive boring, etc) and perhaps make the game a bit more interactive this way. There would random failure rates where the NPC is attacked by a player or another NPC.</p>
<p>The main idea would be to expose a public scripting API on the game’s website, where there would be a developer center. Scripters who sign up would be given a certificate used to authenticate with the API’s and to publish their scripts to a public repository. These scripts could be distributed for free or paid (with in-game currency) and executed through the use of a bound/owned NPC (you could introduce a new screen to manage/sell/bid these NPCs). The higher the skill level the more NPC’s are able to successfully complete their tasks on time, giving incentive to people to actually level up this skill. (*You could impose limits of how many NPC’s can be bound depending on level and of course set a maximum)</p>
<p>So how would train these NPCs? Well they need to be able to withstand other NPCs/Players in order to successfully complete their tasks. So part of the idea of making NPCs more interactive would involve you equipping them with armor and weapons that they could actually use. This means you would need to obtain the right scripts to train them for a period of time. You would be in charge of figuring out what NPCs they would be able to fight and when, obviously meaning the more effective your strategy is the faster you can level up your NPC and have them doing your tasks. This would also reward people who are there in the case your NPC keeps getting attacked by other players by suspending your NPC. Each task has a certain completion mark that needs to be achieved in order to gain experience, if it doesn’t then you would get partial or no experience.</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>New uses of NPCs</li>
<li>More training spots</li>
<li>More utilization of an oversized map</li>
<li>People being able to “legit” bot</li>
<li>New market/sink</li>
</ul>
<p>You could go many ways with this, including combat (NPCs that assist in killing opponents). Anyway its just an idea which hasn’t been refined for years, as it was going to be introduced through a new quest. Obviously this all of course this assumes the server is able to run these tasks concurrently without any issues. Good luck anyway <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Edit: Implementing this would be quite a task as you’d need to improve upon the existing approach to NPCs (which currently isn’t smart and at best a “reactive agent in terms of AI”). These NPCs would need to be able to detect entities and attack them based on a probability model to make it more realistic. Another would be an implementation of a one-to-many relationship between the player and its NPCs, which means a more complex model than the current one. NPC weapons/armor are discrete and unable to be used by players, so that’s another thing to be added. Scripting APIs would be the most challenging as you’d need to decide what exactly can be exposed without it being too costly on the server end. The skill implementation is easy, which involves adding a few new packets. I can’t think of anything else at the moment as its late, so if I missed anything oh well haha.</p>
<p>Edit2: In theory it shouldn’t be too hard on the server as these tasks would be accomplished in an asynchronous manner (meaning we aren’t blocking).</p>

        <p>[quote=“tickle me elmo, post:18, topic:551083”]I’ve always liked playing with the idea of using NPCs to do more than just sit there for quests or combat. Why not utilize NPC’s by creating a new skill where you could “train” your NPC to do tasks for you? You could ideally create a new market for this by being able to resell these “trained” NPC’s to execute tasks for people who want them (retrieving/sending supplies to bank, or buying/selling supplies to stores/people, anything thats repetitive boring, etc) and perhaps make the game a bit more interactive this way. There would random failure rates where the NPC is attacked by a player or another NPC.</p>
<p>The main idea would be to expose a public scripting API on the game’s website, where there would be a developer center. Scripters who sign up would be given a certificate used to authenticate with the API’s and to publish their scripts to a public repository. These scripts could be distributed for free or paid (with in-game currency) and executed through the use of a bound/owned NPC (you could introduce a new screen to manage/sell/bid these NPCs). The higher the skill level the more NPC’s are able to successfully complete their tasks on time, giving incentive to people to actually level up this skill. (*You could impose limits of how many NPC’s can be bound depending on level and of course set a maximum)</p>
<p>So how would train these NPCs? Well they need to be able to withstand other NPCs/Players in order to successfully complete their tasks. So part of the idea of making NPCs more interactive would involve you equipping them with armor and weapons that they could actually use. This means you would need to obtain the right scripts to train them for a period of time. You would be in charge of figuring out what NPCs they would be able to fight and when, obviously meaning the more effective your strategy is the faster you can level up your NPC and have them doing your tasks. This would also reward people who are there in the case your NPC keeps getting attacked by other players by suspending your NPC. Each task has a certain completion mark that needs to be achieved in order to gain experience, if it doesn’t then you would get partial or no experience.</p>

When I was working on PKWithME with Mark, he made a pet system that coulda been adapted for shit like this, but AFAIK he had removed it in the latest revisions he made to the codebase.  That’s actually a decent codebase, though.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Zach Knight, post:17, topic:551083”]Honestly that’d be easy to implement in a day of work, from any working codebase that I am familiar with for RSC gameservers.<br>
So, I’m curious what help you’d like or need.<br>
Also, did you just nab RSCR’s bank screen?  You should implement your own, really.  I can show you the one I’d made when I was writing a new client graphics API and shit, if you want some design ideas if you’re interested in doing that at all…<br>
EDIT: Just watched video of the botting part, you should write server-sided automation, like one automation task per player maybe, or similar, kinda like a followTick but a automationTick task.[/quote]<br>
I looked at RSCR’s bank screen and decided I liked it, so I made my own.  So… the idea was stolen.  But code wasn’t.  It’s a bit messy because I’m so used to a more object oriented approach where the client itself seems anything but that.  But if you want it I’d be willing to share it with ya.  When it comes to help… I don’t know just basically someone to work on things with.  It’s more fun that way.  I get what you mean by it only taking a day or two…  I’ve essentially finished my idea already.  I just don’t know if the server itself will hold up at all.  Is there any simple way to load test these things?  I could spin up a dozen bots between the two computers I have and stick them all in the mining guild or somewhere congested…  but a dozen is still tiny haha.  I like that idea of the automationTick task… I’ll keep thinking about it and how it could potentially be incorporated.</p>
<p>tickle me elmo I love those ideas.  Before any sort of implementation they’d need to be more concrete.  Right now I’m still just building off of easyrsc, so it’s somewhat limited.  I’m realizing the code base for it is actually quite simpleish… although when it comes creating a better design I haven’t put the brain power into it yet.  I’ve done a touch of research on mina and netty.  I feel like I need to dive in and start actually playing around with netty some.  If I continue to put the time in to a point that I start seeing all the pieces come together I’ll put more effort into the design of a new server.</p>
