    <title>My experiences with Salvia</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-experiences-with-salvia/206950</link>
    <description>Holy fuck.

Just a summation:
That&#39;s basically what I&#39;ve got to say. I tried 1g of 20x the second time (the first time I did .25g of 40x, but I didn&#39;t trip out as much as this time) and I thought I went psycho. Shit turned all cartoony and I thought everything was fake so I got up and tried running to the door to escape, but ran back to the couch because I thought &quot;what if this is real? I&#39;d look like a fucking retard&quot;... So I sat back down and chilled for a while. A lot of things happened that I can&#39;t quite remember, I thought my friend was on fire and my other friend was having a seizure when he took a hit.

Perhaps I should try sketching some of the things I saw, if I could remember.

The more you talk the more you trip... and I talked the whole time (Which was over 20min)

By the way, I have videos. I&#39;m considering posting them up on the internetz.

(I&#39;ll probably fix up this post/add more to it when I have time)

edit: Ah, my memory hit me... I believe I pictured people looking like some Photoshop feature I liked. (But extended)

<p>His excuse for not doing it was “I would get very very beaten”…[/quote]Yeah, hence why I mentioned ‘some people’, I referred to me there as well. As I’m not posting anything until I get permission from my friend.</p>

              <p>Holy fuck.</p>
<p>Just a summation:<br>
That’s basically what I’ve got to say. I tried 1g of 20x the second time (the first time I did .25g of 40x, but I didn’t trip out as much as this time) and I thought I went psycho. Shit turned all cartoony and I thought everything was fake so I got up and tried running to the door to escape, but ran back to the couch because I thought “what if this is real? I’d look like a fucking retard”… So I sat back down and chilled for a while. A lot of things happened that I can’t quite remember, I thought my friend was on fire and my other friend was having a seizure when he took a hit.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should try sketching some of the things I saw, if I could remember.</p>
<p>The more you talk the more you trip… and I talked the whole time (Which was over 20min)</p>
<p>By the way, I have videos. I’m considering posting them up on the internetz.</p>
<p>(I’ll probably fix up this post/add more to it when I have time)</p>
<p>edit: Ah, my memory hit me… I believe I pictured people looking like some Photoshop feature I liked. (But extended)<br>
