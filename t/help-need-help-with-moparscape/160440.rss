              <p>seriously dude first read the guide on how to make ur own server and dont just start posting pointless threads . i could hardly understand wat u were sayin its not hard wen u actually think and not just click around were ever and hope sompn happns and since ur friend cant get on im guessing u dont even have a clue about getting ur on no-ip and portforwarding so read guides and learn java a lil bit more and wen u have done trial and error and cant get an answer then post in good detail.</p>

              <p>It isn’t just push the button and start new server. It’s quite a lot of work to make everything your own and working. I recomment to you to download a server source e.g. testscape, cheezscape (see toturial page) and start edditing the files.</p>
<p>You can open cfg files with notepad.</p>
<p>an object is an item like a borrel or box, an npc is a monster or ‘computer person’.</p>
<p>Also see the toturial section how to make your own shop, I tought zezimaisme111 made a really good oen about it.</p>
