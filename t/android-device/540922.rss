    <description>got a galaxy s4 with a completely dead screen. have no way to tell if the touch screen is working or not.

trying to get usb debugging enabled, to use droid@screen, but i cannot for the life of me, get it. i tried side-by-side scrolling with another in tact, s4, but to no avail. this is probably due to the fact the broken one has a passcode. now i can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m hitting the wrong numbers (i know the passcode) or if the touch screen is dead as well as the lcd.

anyone know of a program that can view an androids screen, without usb debugging/without downloading applications to the phone?

i cannot get adb to recognize the phone as the setting is off.

rooting is not an answer, nor is flashing the phone. i need all data in tact.


any help is appreciated.</description>

              <p>went out and found one. however, my tv still displays ‘no signal’ perhaps the phone must be unlocked, or a setting must be enabled to do so?</p>
<p>any help is appreciated. really hoping to back up these photos and whatnot.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">should have probably read reviews. bought one not knowing the s4 needed a 7pin</span></p>

Samsung sell a HDMI adapter, but I saw one on Amazon for £25 (official ofc). I’m sure you might be able to get cheaper ones on eBay or something.</p>

              <p>If your monitor has a HDMI port you can get a HDMI adapter that plug into your phone and pc. All you then need to do is view HDMI on your monitor and it should show up on your screen. You don’t need to play with the settings or anything with the phone either.</p>
