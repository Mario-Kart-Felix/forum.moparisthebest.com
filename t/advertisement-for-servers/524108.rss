    <description>Hey Guys, 

Are you looking for a video editor someone to make an advertisement for your server or edit any of your current videos.

I do both, I will work with you 1on1 to make sure you get the best for your money only message me if you&#39;re interested and I will show current work as I am currently working on several products with a few clients.

I work for a low cost and am very fair with my prices as I don&#39;t want to charge a lot.

Details: Advertisements:  The advertisements I do start from 0:30 - 3:00 (Minutes) and depending on the time it takes will be the amount charged this is than again all further details that we will discus.

Pk videos: I can edit all pking clips from EOC - Old school RS usually are around 3-7 Minutes long.

[ I also do any type of videos such as Montages for video games , and In real life videos ]

Other previous work was taken off my old computer as it wasn&#39;t backed up when computer crashed. If you&#39;re interested we will get the right product for you and I will show other projects I am working on.

[B][U]Footage (Video):[/U][/B]Depending on how you would like to do it you can send your videos to me via [U]DropBox[/U] or another source you would like. I can also film the footage myself seen in the video above [U]Vicious Revolution[/U]. We will talk in further details if there is a problem.

All payments are made VIA Paypal and how everything works is I will make your video and show it to you (Will have my details spammed all over) and if you want to purchase it I will remove all the details and send you the raw video that you can than put under your name and directly upload it to any site you please.

Prices from person to person can change all depending on the amount of time and the length I give cheap prices and are roughly working on a handful of videos at a time but always make room for new customers. Best way to contact me is through  [B]SKYPE: XTOMUCHX[/B]
We will than chat into further detail and I will show you examples and get the results you need.

All the best,
