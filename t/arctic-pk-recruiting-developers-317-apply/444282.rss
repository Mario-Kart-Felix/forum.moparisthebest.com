Hmmm. My introduction, I am the owner of The New Arctic-Pk, and I am happy to say that we are looking for a staff and development team. I am looking to bring new people and new ideas in to this small project I have been working on. At this moment we have made it to 11 rank on rune-server toplist and obtaining higher ranks on others. We have a dedicated player base, and we have plenty of room for growth but we need a developer/developers to help out. Apply now or forever wonder what could I have been apart of!

So basically, I once was a rsps addict, after runescape fell apart. Then someone gave me the idea a few years back to start my own but I always disregarded it. Thus Arctic-Pk was born. My whole reason for making this server is because all the people I knew were unsatisfied with the servers they were playing and wishing for a better one. Well the plan grew more and more then it became a reality. All of my mates joined their mates joined then it was running, smooth. Unfortunately alot of things happend to me irl so arctic-pk had to hibernate, now shes up and hungrier than ever.

My goal is to just make a fun place to Pk and have fun with mates, and a place were people can play all day, no down time, no interruptions.

All of the developers, after trust is earned will use my team viewer or my drop box and eventually they will get the files so they can code on their own. Most of our donations will go to our servers vps and all upcoming new things, vbulliten ect. But our developers do in fact get paid if they so request it. 

We need many small things, and yes big updates eventually but as of right now our features include: 
- Working Curses 100%
- All specials 100%
- Non-freezing barrage orbs 100%
- All skills, dung and summoning 100%
- Working dice bag for donors 100%
- All bosses with rare drops 100%
- And many more coming soon with new development help
- Working Nex armours 100%
- Pvp Armors 100%
- Growing community / Active Staff
- Duel arena 100%
- Little to no lag
- Fair exp rates
