    <title>Fox v4.5 - Final release;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fox-v4-5-final-release/327867</link>
    <description>*sigh*, nobody takes the time to search peoples backgrounds.

[b]I am -
[u]Kastro[/u](Rune server)
[u]Jeba[/u](Silab)
[u]`jeba[/u](Mopar)
[u]Firehawk Fox[/u](My own server)
[u]1337Gbz [/u](RSBOT).[/b]

I decided I&#39;m done with 317s - switched to Hyperion #459. I figured I&#39;d let this community have my release. (this is outdated by a few months). I personally (by myself) built this up from an out-dated piece of shit, to something that can be hosted. Of course; with a little work, packaging, packet handling and maybe an event manager added you&#39;d probably do a lot better.


As all of my releases of this keep ending up with people showing interest, [S]I&#39;ll keep working on it until I decide I want to move to Hyperion or turn another under-rated server into something which can be hosted and played for fun.[/S]

Alright, this version&#39;s received some heavy work, I downgraded a little from what I was doing with the equipment as it was fairly pointless.


Information:

Base: wLv3
Economy: started, fairly medium.
Customs: No
Client required?: Any other than MoparScape.
Combat system: Basic WinterLove (I may of released correct range max hits in this version, IDK)
Features: Stuff in updates log.
Minigames: None, I removed Figment&#39;s pathetic P.Czar Barrows.
Clue-scrolls: Yes, I plan to abandon my current clues and turn them into random things rather than story lines.

I love pasting this:

As there&#39;s still a bunch of morons who use Czars and Allstar base, they won&#39;t complain about the combat. This server is intended to be adventure-based meaning you DO NOT HAVE A FUCKING SKILLING AREA. You must walk around the server to gain items and go places.

Recent-ish updates:
[CODE]Enchants re-written.
Superheat re-written, should be near flawless.
EXP multiples are added (I set everything to RS exp and X1)
Some combat bugs fixed
Arrows delete when fired.
TeleTabs removed.
Agility removed.
High amount of other things which aren&#39;t noticed in-game re-written.[/CODE]

If anyone around here says I leeched, you honestly need to stab yourself until you die. Rate me, hate me. This is outdated by far. Off to Hyperion now.</description>

<p>All my progress up until 4.5 has been small, since I released 4.5 - I stopped releasing because nobody will stop using Delta (I was trying to give people options for good economys ect). I was going to host but came across some issues; now I moved onto Hyperion for a <span class="hashtag">#459</span> revision.</p>
<p>If anybody still has doubts of who I am, you go to R-S and you may PM me personally.</p>

Aeterna - (Helped me with a lot of things, corrected multiple things which I posted for oppinions.)
Rs2o - (Normal arrays)
BreakPown (Delta) - (Looked at his servers code to learn how some stuff was done, without looking I'd probably of not discovered timers)
Webber - (I used his client, without it i'd probably be still figuring out object ID's- or using SilabSoft.)
Whoever released the DEOB - (saved me from Webbers', I now debug ingame)
Ian (Not Core) - (His work on wL is a good Guideline)</code></p>
<p>If anyone around here says I leeched, you honestly need to stab yourself until you die. Rate me, hate me. This is outdated by far. Off to Hyperion now.</p>
