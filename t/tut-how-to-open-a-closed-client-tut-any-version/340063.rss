<p>easy as shit to do, and plus most people now password lock and store their client files in different locations, along with that they compile all their java files into .class files. Just because you found out how to unhide folders, doesn’t mean you know anything. You don’t even have to do this! go to the organize button of your folder and press folder options&gt;view, see? easy as anything. now could someone lock this please?</p>
