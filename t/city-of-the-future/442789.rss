    <description>Saw this on a commercial on adult swim, apparently a $1 billion dollar futuristic city is being built in New Mexico for testing purposes.

              <p>Quoting a comment made by Mike Sweitzer in response to that article, which I partially agree with:</p>
<blockquote>this is so dumb... I wonder how homeless people feel about this... biggest waste of a billion $ ever.. this is what innovative thinkers are for.. being able to envision , in ones mind, how all those things without wasting a billions of dollars on models that can be observed... how bout instead we dedicate all that infrastructure to the homeless and THINK about ways to improve then actually make them happen, rather than waste billions of $$ on pretending.</blockquote>
