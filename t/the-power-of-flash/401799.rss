This is the power of Flashes new hardware accelerated 3D (or 2D).
They will release Flash Player 11 PUBLIC in a month or 2. (Everyone can get an incubator build to test out Flash Player 11 programs like the game on the video for example.)


I&#39;m tired of all the pre-judgements of people telling flash sucks.

Also, in the Creative Suite 5, you can make local apps for Android, Iphone, Blackberry,...
So guess what, Flash is just beginning.</description>

In order to port a game written in one of those engines to HTML5, the makers have to rewrite their entire engine. Also, those engines are basicly extentions to Flash, you have to download their API into flash, and the flash compiler compiles the games. CopperCube is a bit different from the other API’s because it has it’s own client, when developing in CopperCube it’s like developing in a completely different platform that can export your project as a swf file. That is why there is compability for HTML5 as well, they wrote their own engine for making 3D applications and they used the core of Flash and HTML5 to export it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/YY7J6xIkt9M" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/v/YY7J6xIkt9M</a>[/quote]The new flash player uses OpenGL and Direct3D (DirectX) also, with the new platform you can develop local applications for almost every platform. They have their own GFX library implementation called Stage3D but they also have teamed up with Alternativa3D, Away3d, CopperCube, Flare3D, Minko, Sophie3D and Yogurt3D wich gives developers huge variation in developing 3D. Flash is better because it has been developed since 1996 and is extremely stable.</p>
<p>The language is ActionScript wich is based on ECMAScript, just like Javascript. And ECMAScript is just awesome, I love to write it.</p>
<p>Flash is better because it is maintained by Adobe. A company with responsibility. How much does it cost? If your a student you can get a copy for 140 dollars.</p>
<p>Also, flash has one of the best text and vector graphics engines.</p>
