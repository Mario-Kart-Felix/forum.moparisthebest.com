    <title>My Introduction- New staff member of Dr. House&#39;s new team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-introduction-new-staff-member-of-dr-houses-new-team/555315</link>
    <description>Good day,

My name is Gander. Some of you may know me. I&#39;ve been involved with the private server scene for several years now. I developed some of the most popular servers in the past and have been asked to develop and manage the new client and server by Dr. House.

A mass email will be sent out when I am finished developing the server which should be in a few days(We will be launching the official website relaunch as well so stay tuned for that).

I recommend everyone try the server. You will have to re-run java on your first time loading as it is a new server. 

As well, I have seen many suggestions regarding a chatbox. Though I&#39;m not great with SMF, I&#39;ve been writing a script custom for the current forums. It will be powered on Java similar to IRC and all you will need to do is click yes and run the java programmer and you will be able to chat with your fellow forum users finally!


I look forward to working with Dr. House and the new team that we will be adding. The future of Moparscape looks exciting!

It makes sense now… they bought the forums to use as a front for a new server that comes with a pre-populated email database to advertise from, and thats why they were willing to spend so much money. Can’t wait to see what amazing items will be for sale on our new MoparMarket! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>I believe I’m at liberty now to release more information about our plan. On Wednesday the current inactive staff members will be removed (Active ones will remain). Our site will be transformed into IPB Forums (hopefully) by the end of the week once our team receives their admin privileges. As some of you have heard already, we will be merging with another prominent RSPS site Rune–Locus. The RL infrastructure and guide database is paramount and contains a plethora of information on creating servers. Of course, Moparscape has the top-list and client structure built. We are combing the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The new domain will be a combination of the names. I will not reveal the name just yet as I want to leave a surprise for everyone.</p>
<p>Our goal is to be transparent with the community. Thank you for your understanding and I know you are all as excited as our team![/quote]<br>

<p>I believe I’m at liberty now to release more information about our plan. On Wednesday the current inactive staff members will be removed (Active ones will remain). Our site will be transformed into IPB Forums (hopefully) by the end of the week once our team receives their admin privileges. As some of you have heard already, we will be merging with another prominent RSPS site Rune–Locus. The RL infrastructure and guide database is paramount and contains a plethora of information on creating servers. Of course, Moparscape has the top-list and client structure built. We are combing the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>The new domain will be a combination of the names. I will not reveal the name just yet as I want to leave a surprise for everyone.</p>
<p>Our goal is to be transparent with the community. Thank you for your understanding and I know you are all as excited as our team![/quote]</p>
