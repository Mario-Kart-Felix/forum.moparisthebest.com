              <p>Who cares if they secede? Who cares what their motives are?</p>
<p>I have no intention to force the people of Louisiana to stay in the Union.</p>
<p>Legality is a silly issue, if they do secede and it is found to be illegal, do we go to war? How many people would die? How many people would die if we just shrugged our shoulders and moved on?</p>
<p>While I don’t always agree with everyone, I do believe in self government. If we claim that our Governments are by the people, of the people, and for the people, why not let them self govern peacefully?</p>
<p>If they end up not being able to support themselves then fine, let them learn a lesson the hard way. If they become prosperous, we should probably take a lesson from them.</p>

[li]insurance companies being forced to pay for people with pre-existing conditions[/li]<br>
[li]force people to get health-insurance or pay a fine so the cost of healthcare for everyone goes down[/li][/ul]</p>

<p>hell the god damn united states can’t even let a country have a civil war when it has an invested interest in that country, what makes you think the states would just forget about texas?</p>
<p>here’s how an invasion by a military force on texas would go down: the texan citizens would fight with the metric shit-ton of guns they have, the international western community will provide military assistance for the texas citizens, the united states would provide military assistance to the texas citizens</p>

<p>You already have the state government, you can keep that or reshape it with a new constitution. If you need allies you can try to join NATO.  Texas already have a border against Mexico, so that isn’t any problem.</p>
<p>European countries did fine with independence. It sounds like you have gotten your arguments from early 19th century.</p>

              <p>Let’s say that Texas, or any other state successfully secedes. At that point, they may no longer have the backing of the United States, or its allies. They would now be their own nation. They would need to create their own infrastructure. Most companies would take advantage of this, by serving the new nation, with increased cost. Companies could monopolize. They would still need a form of government, which may or may not be easy. One person could take over, and turn it into a democratic nation, or communist, or anything else. After that, laws would need to be made, or remade, because the federal government no longer has any leeway. Borders would be put up to protect the United States, so now there’s the whole international issue to deal with. Assuming the drug cartels don’t decimate the ex-state Texas, and they are not allies with anyone (cut ALL ties to US and Mexico) anyone can come in, take down this new weakened government, and claim the territory for themselves.</p>
<p>Assuming they do survive long enough independently, they would need to build diplomatic relations. It might be easier/harder depending on the actions they took to last this long. And if, at some point in the future, the decide they want to join back up with the US, many conditions would need to be met. It wouldn’t be a “Hey, long time no see, welcome back!” type thing. They would need to prove that they are capable of having a peaceful relationship, and compromises would have to be made in terms of laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Over all, at this point in time, it would be an absolute horrible idea to secede from the US, and is not a decision that should be taken lightly.</p>

Eventually it just boils down until total anarchism.</p>
<p>Regardless, these petitions hold no value at all in reality.</p>
<p>&amp; Then, let’s say they do secede. They would almost immediately be taken over by the surronding country’s like Mexico and Canada providing them with tons of new economic resources.</p>
