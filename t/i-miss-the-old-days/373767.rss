    <title>I miss the old days</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-miss-the-old-days/373767</link>
    <description>Do any of you remember when you could host a server, throw it on the server status, and get 10-20 players without even trying?
Back when having over 90% uptime was considered an accomplishment? Back when players trained attack on dummies, strength on doors, and defence on hay bales.

Nowadays, RuneScape emulation has turned into a business. If you have [b]99%[/b] uptime, you&#39;ll be on [b]page 3[/b] of the server status. Everyone has dedicated servers, some people make thousands of dollars, etc. and I feel like RuneScape emulation has lost the &quot;innocent fun&quot; aspect that it used to have, and now it&#39;s a commercial operation where you have to work your ass off just to get some loyal players and spotlight.

What happened to us? Can we ever get back? Maybe I should start over, and make a completely separate website and sever all ties with the current RuneScape community (MoparScape, R-S, etc.). I could make my own source and give it to people to use and build off of. It could be an open-source community based around one server and one central repository, started off properly.

&lt;/rant&gt;</description>

              <p>Glad to see this topic again. When was the last time a server had ::starter and you got 5m to blow?<br>
Hell, I just hate dling clients. Using mopar’s client was great, then I kept getting so confused at what “silabsoft” was. Then finally using it… that was great. Dling clients one day then deleting them the next was a bitch. I haven’t played a p server legitamently since last September or so, and was only with one server.</p>

              <p>[quote=“TOMSCAPE BETA, post:11, topic:373767”]Yep, nowdays people spend thousands on private servers. Golden racks all the players in etc etc, people paying for dedis/vps.</p>
<p>I remember when every server I logged on had players, now it’s a ghost town. I remember when pretty much every server was home hosted, you’d never know if it’d be online or offline. The owners claimed it was 24/7 but it wasn’t really.</p>
<p>Every big server now seems to be based around making profit. I made my first server in like 2007, it was fun, suprising and kept me amazed for months. I found it amazing how thriving the rsps community was, now I find it profit based, boring and lonely.</p>
<p>OFFTOPIC: Is it just me, or does it feel like yesterday when the first 508s where released? I mean wow.[/quote]</p>
<p>I remember when 508’s were released.<br>
I was still using some shitty Czar and deltascape was the best thing going around.<br>
I guess whats happened is that alot of hardcore runescape players quite, and have come to the rsps community and expect to have the ‘runescape’ experience, and server owners are just taking advantage of that.<br>
It does kill the community, because everything is just about money now.</p>

mopar, I think it’d be great if the server status page placed more weighting on the time the server has existed in terms of the default ordering on the status page. The majority of the ones on the top only have 100% uptime because they are 1 week old, whereas there are some that are a year old but have around 95% uptime so don’t appear the top. I’d much rather have those well established servers appearing up there because it shows that whoever owns them is really dedicated towards running it, as opposed to someone who gets a cheap VPS deal for 1 month, slaps some crappy server on it and then shuts their server down after 2 weeks because they don’t have the determination to keep a project going.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I like this idea, but I’m not sure the best way to implement it, and I’m not sure if it would be good to make it the default sorting method.  I could make a link like the ‘Most Popular’ servers at the top of the page, maybe ‘Stable Servers’ or ‘Established Servers’? (help me on the name) And make it only display servers perhaps older than 2 months old with greater than 90% uptime, how would that be?</p>
<p>If this was made the default sort method, it would be even harder for new servers to start up, which was the original complaint in this thread.[/quote]Well why even make a seperate page? why not just make it on the front page under the sponsored servers?<br>
the average player doesn’t take time to look at the sorting options, they just look at the first server they see.</p>

<p>which is what i mean, they have to show it on a special section that should be made were they have to show their development on their server, etc, so we know what kind of person/server it is, and if its good enough, then a mod/admin has the ability to add it onto the server status, were the user can then edit it with his/her user and pass.</p>
