Rune Online is a fast paced remake based in the year 2006 made purely for entertainment. Our goal is to keep anyone interested in this server coming back for more every day and having a great time while online. We accomplish this by running regular polls to ensure the majority is content with our updates, if you guys don&#39;t want it we won&#39;t do it. We also post FAQs and have open discussions about these polls, going over the pros and cons so that everyone gets an idea what&#39;s going on.

As far as updates go, we will try to get in at least one update every day, usually consisting of at least one bug fix or minor change. All of these changes can be found in the patch notes on the forum. For the bigger updates we already have so much content to enjoy that we aren&#39;t in a huge hurry to release more. We&#39;d love to release a quest for you every week or even every month, but these are far too time consuming and I&#39;d rather work out some of the kinks in the content we already have first. This doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t have big updates, we know what we want to add and we&#39;ll get it out there eventually. We still highly encourage all players to let us know what they want so we have an idea of what to get started on first.

Combat has been improved by adding a weakness system and making your stats matter more than ever. Slayer monsters also have the proper special abilities and effects, such as teleporting abyssal demons and smelly aberrent spectres.

[B]Now for the media, where most of you will skip to.[/B]

The current list of content is far too large for an advertisement, and frankly I don&#39;t even remember everything off the top of my head. Just know there&#39;s all sorts of dungeons, towns, islands and more already there for you to explore and we&#39;re not even done yet. You&#39;ll find the essentials and more than enough to keep you busy for awhile.</description>

<p>This is true…it’ll probably never be finished unless someone makes all of their work open for everyone to use, so that it can be finished…Though ‘remakes’ should technically be clean bases for you to start off of &amp; create whichever…</p>

<p>As voted for by our players we will now be having Bonus XP Weekends every weekend started today. This weekend also happens to be our first holiday event, which features discounts in our Loyalty Point shop for all Easter related items. The Bonus XP will be 1.5x for Saturday and 1.2x for Sunday. We will make changes to the rates in the upcoming weeks if necessary, so let us know if it’s necessary.</p>
<p>We’ve also added a new command (::xp), which lets you toggle what experience you gain. You can block combat experience or simply block experience altogether. We can always add more modes but these are the most commonly requested.</p>
<p>Finally we added a Top 10 Voters page. Now you can compete to be the number one supporter of Rune Online! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
