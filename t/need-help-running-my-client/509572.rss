    <title>Need help running my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-running-my-client/509572</link>
    <description>Whenever I download a source, and do the .run, it has some error or something. I&#39;m not really a coder, I&#39;d just like to start a server for my friends and run it, and work my way into coding over time. If anyone can help me, I have teamviewer and skype, please reply and let me know. Thanks.</description>
