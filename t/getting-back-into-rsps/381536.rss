    <title>Getting back into RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-back-into-rsps/381536</link>
    <description>I&#39;m wanting to get back into RSPS, but I&#39;m only going to be in it for the money. What would be some requirements to have a good popular server?
I have 2.5Gb RAM (I ran fine with 1gb in the past)
I know some RSPS stuff (placing items in correct slots, simple commands, etc.)
I&#39;m a deltafag.

I would like to know the recommended sources/clients, types (317, 474, 508....), what the server should contain, you get the gist of it.</description>

Doesn’t matter how good your server is unless you can advertise.<br>

I was told my server was great (features wise) by anyone that logged in, and yet (because I didn’t advertise) I never had more than 15 online (since the sponsored servers)</p>

<p>I’m not sure of any good ones you can download, though.</p>
<p>You should also always spell everything right. And maybe add a few quests (with words spelled correctly…people like me don’t want to be reading “yah n0w u go 2 varrok nd get a chisel!”)</p>
