    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jdk-runserver-issue-plz-help/255114</link>
    <description>Ok so when i first tried to run the server it said &quot;please Compile the server first&quot; so i did,  but when i tried to compile it said &quot;Please Install JDK 05 or 06&quot; so i installed JDK 6 Update 11 but when i tried it again it said i still didnt have it. I thaught i might ste that i was running from the compiler/runserver thing where you have to type in like &quot;c&quot; to compile or &quot;R&quot; to run. then when i tried to do it sepretley like from just the compiler it worked but when i tried the run server it opend for a sec then closed. I know there are diffirent codes for the runserver currently mine has [code]@echo off
color 0a
title ParScape v2 - By Airmax
java -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server[/code]

can some one post a diffirent code or tell me what to do?</description>
