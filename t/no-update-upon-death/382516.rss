    <title>No update upon death?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-update-upon-death/382516</link>
    <description>I&#39;m testing my pk area by using 2 computers and logging into a char on each.

When player A kills player B, player B does the death emote. Then on players B&#39;s screen he is teleported back to home like normal. But player A still views player B sitting right where player B died. When player B moves, he moves from where he died on player A&#39;s screen.

If you can follow that description I&#39;d appreciated a little help here.

EDIT: I have temporarily &quot;fixed&quot; this by applying a kick to the defeated player so they are refreshed, need a permanent fix..</description>
