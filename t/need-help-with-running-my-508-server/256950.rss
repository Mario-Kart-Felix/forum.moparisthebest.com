    <title>Need help with running my 508 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-running-my-508-server/256950</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m trying to figure this whole thing out with 508 servers, and I&#39;m running into nothing but problems.

My ip changer keeps on freezing up on &quot;connecting to update server,&quot; I have my cache in the right place, my server is running, and I have tried downloading new ip changers. Under the cmd window it says, &quot;error_game_js5io.&quot; Reading other topics, people have said that this is caused by not renaming your cache &quot;cache508,&quot; and by not placing your downloaded cache in it; however, looking at many guides I have correctly placed my cache, and still the same problem persists.

Please help me, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong.</description>

<p>My ip changer keeps on freezing up on “connecting to update server,” I have my cache in the right place, my server is running, and I have tried downloading new ip changers. Under the cmd window it says, “error_game_js5io.” Reading other topics, people have said that this is caused by not renaming your cache “cache508,” and by not placing your downloaded cache in it; however, looking at many guides I have correctly placed my cache, and still the same problem persists.</p>
