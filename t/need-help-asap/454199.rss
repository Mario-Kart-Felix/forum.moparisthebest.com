    <description>i am running torvapkz client and want to change the ip to no-ip which i did.. i made a web client and change the ip in the client.java as well as the gui.java and others can still not connect. yes i portforwarded correctly because i checked on canyouseeme.org and there is one thing i don&#39;t get. on client.java there is 2 spots where it says server = one says server = and the other says  public static string server = would i have to change both to my no-ip? 

if anyone one could help me it would be greatly appreciated

also on the sever side the server.java has a place where it has 0.0.0.0 as an ip do i  have to change that too?</description>

              <p>ok if you portforwarded correctly  u need to download the no-ip program called “DUC 3.0” open it and select you no-ip…</p>
<p>go into ur client folder open client.java search for “server =” untill u find either the localhost ip  or your no-ip  if its ur no-ip leave it alone…  compile everything! and you didnt need to  change the gui.java  or ANYTHING in the source file… and if you didnt know… only your friends can connect to the no-ip and only you can connect to the localhost ip[quote=“sandnagger, post:1, topic:454199”]also on the sever side the server.java has a place where it has 0.0.0.0 as an ip do i  have to change that too?[/quote]</p>
