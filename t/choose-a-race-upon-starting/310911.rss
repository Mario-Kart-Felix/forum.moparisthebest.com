    <title>Choose a race upon starting?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/choose-a-race-upon-starting/310911</link>
    <description>K after reading a topic in RSC advertisement it looked like a decent idea for a server, and i need to learn some coding so i thought that it&#39;ll be a nice way to learn.

I want to make a server where there is

Fally : 1 team. Faladorians or whatever
Barb Village : Basically the wildy
Varrock : Other &#39;team&#39;s side
Lumby - start area + quest/skill area i s&#39;pose
Edge - Trading area + shop npc&#39;s.

Going to bar off the rest of the land.

What i want is for when you start, you start next to an npc, alright i can do that, you talk to him and he asks you what side you would like to join

you tell him which one, he says are you sure, you say yes and get tele&#39;d to the starting place + starter (i can do that), and no you go back and choose again, now how would i make it go into the character files so people couldnt go back to lumby and repeat this over and over for starters? And i want to make it so it says like

With the rights etc... jad etc..

Faladorian : 0
Varrockwhatever : 1

depending on the side you choose- 

Thanks for your help, ill elaborate if needed- if you want to help me via msn - jeddac@hotmail.com
