    <title>Anyone else annoyed about SW:TOR?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-else-annoyed-about-sw-tor/426360</link>
    <description>(SW:TOR = Starwars: The Old Republic)
I pre-ordered the game and got 30 days to play, but now 3 days in they require a credit card linked to the account to continue the subscription.
Now, I don&#39;t have a credit card so the 27 remaining days are just going to die off, which now I&#39;m pissed and about to ask for a refund for the game because I was planning on playing it for those 30 days and hopefully have enough fun til I have enough money to round out another 60 subscription.

Anyone else have the game and a little annoyed, or am I just over-reacting?</description>

              <p>But thats the point of MMO, and SWTOR is dynamic, everything you do effects what happens to you on a later date, if you kill someone, things will effect you because that person knew someone who could of given you a quest, but now you cant do that for that person.<br>

Frankly, anything related to star-wars or lord of the rings is just a flat out waste of time period. Saints Row the Third was pretty kick ass, and no fucking subscription to boot.<br>

you’ll regret the entire MMO genre, once you’ve played one you’ve practically played them all. The entire function of an MMO is to release recycled storylines into a false atmosphere of reality in which users do the same quest over and over again. The effect has no lasting potential whatsoever after a few days of playing. WoW vs Runescape i’d say they’re exactly alike, but there are constant wars and split households over the argument of how different and how much better they each are.</p>
