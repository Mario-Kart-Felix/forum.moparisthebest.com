              <p>I think the prices where you modify the prices is the items value i.e. alching it. Their must be a modifier that has been applied somewhere which you’ll need to find (it’ll be in a class that is related to shops ofc…). This post was meant to tell you what is happening rather than how to fix it but if browse around I’m sure you can find the modifier.</p>
