<p>If you host on vps its a lot faster. I would get vps and a better server at the same time. Promote it with ads and youtube videos. It will get popular. Also get your players to spam other popular servers that arent as good as yours. Like GodzHell perfect place to spam it sucks like crazy but it was one of the first RSPS so it is popular. My server base is better than GodzHell. And I just started on it. Lol… I would also get a forums and website for your server. Get a webclient too that helps a lot. You can pay people to make them for you. Make sure the server has decent graphics not too high though coz a lot of people on rsps have slow computers because they are young. Make lots of events and stuff too. Good luck :3</p>
