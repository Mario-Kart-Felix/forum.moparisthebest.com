    <description>Looking for a small server looking to move up to a 24/7 dedicated desktop, the specs are as follows:
Quad Core 2.4gH Xeon Intel Processor 64 Bit
6 GB Ram
60 GB SSD

Internet stats:
100 MB download/ 20 MB upload/ unlimited bandwidth

Operating system:
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Linux

Software:
MYSQL 5.6


If you don&#39;t know how to work Linux, not a problem. It comes with a server manager program that you run from your computer that allows you to update your source and restart your server.

Optional Additions:
Functional database (MYSQL)
Manager program has the following: Ban, Kick, Mute
