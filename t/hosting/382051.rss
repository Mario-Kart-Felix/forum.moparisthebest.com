    <description>okay so heres my problem:
I was able to host private servers for a long time and they all worked fine I had many players on my servers at all times.  Then I got a laptop.  So I had to get a new wireless router.  So I thought to my self &quot;Hey its not big deal ill just reportforward and the server should be back up&quot;  I was wrong -.-;; I have tried portforwarding and all that jazz but still I cannot have others connect to my private servers.  Does anyone have any suggestions please! I will give you a hug :S I really wanna host my server again D=

Possible FAQ&#39;s
Q: Did you portforward?
A: Yes I did but it didnt work still
Q: Do you have a no ip?
A: Yes I do
Q: Can you even get on the server?
A: Yes I can but only when the ip is set to 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 or w.e
If you can help thanks :D</description>

              <p>I dunno if this changes anything but I also have a desktop computer(what I used to use) and even it cannot host servers.  OH! and one other thing when I turned on my laptop one time it said a computer on this connection also has the same ip then somthing else and it said press ok so I did.  Would that have anything to do with it?</p>

              <p>Not sure man but I know a lot of people who think they port forwarded but they didn’t do it correctly. This is probably the case.</p>
