    <description>Ok i&#39;ve been thinking about getting a host for my server, cause my computer is just about out of memory, and it makes my computer freeze up alot. But i would like to know all the details about what a host does, and how to get one and what to do when you get one.
Please help me out! :o

              <p>You need to buy a Windows VPS or a Windows Dedicated Server</p>
<p>VPS is basically a Virtual Server - you can run .EXE’s on it so thats fine.<br>
Dedicated is basically another computer but has a good CPU/RAM. - Better than VPS.</p>
