Of course not its a cookie.<br>
StaticClass.Class74_Sub1_aString2826 = getParameter(“settings”);<br>
They use this parameter in pretty much all of the open new document URLs. More importantly they set a cookie. I haven’t looked too hard but its used elsewhere and I’m pretty certain its sent to the server over the game connection.</p>

They can't but they can call getDeclaredField and getDeclaredMethod on any class they like. Your interface methods would be the logical place to check but I haven't heard reports of that actually happening. That said there should be precautions and at least a way of monitoring it.

To make a few things straight:<br>
Nobody knows (except JaGEx…) exactly how their anti-macro system works. Any assumptions you make a based on rough ideas and not on facts.<br>
I do not agree with the fact that they aren’t strict. There is no reason why they would let you use RSBot to play legit, is there?</p>
<p>There are ways they might detect RSBot, but on the current information I can see. I have a strong believe that they don’t specifically detect it when not running any scripts (so no bad mouse patterns / bad scripts / bad reactions etc).</p>
<p>Anyway I still agree it’s possible that they do, that’s why I’m creating a bot that’s impossible to detect other then bad scripts / weird reactions.</p>

<p>Obviously, that’s one of the reasons I made QBot. But if you compare RSBot with the time of Aryan (later on), you will see a lot less bans unless people bot to much.<br>
So that gives me a valid reason to believe RSBot is less detectable then some people assume.<br>

<p>Any resource gaining activity is bad for players because it provides less for them. You will see less people banned for fletching then for mining.<br>

<p>I’d love to hear some proof of why you think this and what you think causes it…  Otherwise that just sounds like a false rumor floating around to me.<br>

Actually its true. At the very least they don’t parse the applet parameters.[/quote]<br>
What? It contains all needed applet parameters in the BotStub. There’s no need to parse it from the site really.</p>
<p>I never got banned for using RSBot for being logged in, which is something you will when using a deob.<br>
Therefor I can say RSBot might be detectable (if they wanted too), but they don’t really do it.</p>
<p>What they do detect are bad scripts and they heavily rely on reports.</p>
<p>Anyway this kind of discussion shouldn’t be here really, but should be posted on <a href="http://rsbot.org" rel="nofollow noopener">rsbot.org</a> instead.</p>

              <p>There’s no such thing as an unbanable script. There’s too many factors involved in whether you’re selected to be banned or not. If you 100% don’t want to be banned, then cheating is not for you.</p>

              <p>This kind of question doesn’t really belong in this section but I can see why you’ve posted it here. If the account has no prior macroing offenses, go ahead and bot it after upgrading it to members (members get a 10day temp ban before perm ban, nonmembers get permed 1st offense) Once you get temp banned (never happens to some people, depends on how smart you are about botting) you’re done botting on that account or you risk being perm banned.</p>
