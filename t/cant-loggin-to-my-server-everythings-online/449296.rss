    <title>Cant loggin to my server. Everythings Online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-loggin-to-my-server-everythings-online/449296</link>
    <description>I already portfowarded and changed all the IP addresses from local(127.0.0.1) to my no-ip. I even started hosting from dropbox. Everything loads and is online. The webclient loads, im able to make a server on rswebclients, and I can list my rsps on other websites like these. Status says its online and everything looks right but when i try loggin in to play, it says im unable to join, like it&#39;s offline. This happens to me and other people who try playing. It might have something to do with my IP, as i have looked into this before posting, and i hope someone can help me out.

                                                                                                             ---Ishh</description>

              <p>Thanks for the info but i have decided to close my Delta server and start again with PI. Again thank you for your effort, but I feel as if Delta is dying down faster than normal becasue I dont even see anymore youtube videos about it :eek:<br>

              <p>Ishh, The error your getting I think might be your client. You’ve changed the ip address to your no-ip… You have to connect to your server with your client ip set to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) and give other players the no-ip. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
