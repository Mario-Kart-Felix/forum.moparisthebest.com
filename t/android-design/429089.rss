    <description>Google released a website recently dubbed &quot;Android Design&quot; which gives tips and suggestions for how you should design your mobile application. While it articulates specifically towards the mobile operating system, there are certain parts that really give a sense of how a [b]website[/b] should be designed too, to a certain degree. It&#39;s probably the best in-depth website on user interface and design I&#39;ve ever read in my life. Definitely worth looking over. I&#39;ve bookmarked it myself.
