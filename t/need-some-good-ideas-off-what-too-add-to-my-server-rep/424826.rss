              <p>[quote=“Eclipse639, post:2, topic:424826”]A Bounty Master/System.</p>
<p>Basically here’s how it works, Every player would get say a book or just a stored interface that’s handled by the bounty master upon talking to them. Players can put bounty’s/rewards on a players head, If a user chooses to accept the challenge, they would get a ticket or something stating the user’s name they have accepted the bounty for. And if that user is killed by the player who accepted the bounty, they would recieve a ticket/receipt of some sort dropped by the player on the player’s death. Simply bring it back to the bounty master, and exchange it for the stored reward :3[/quote]<br>
i may do something like this thanks for the post</p>
