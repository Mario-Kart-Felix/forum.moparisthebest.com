    <description>Ok, you know you have to PortForward if your a Broadband user...

The problem is.. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TOO!  :mad:

I am a Thompson-acatel SpeedTouch 5x6 Modem.. and i&#39;ve tried everything.

I&#39;ve re-installed No-Ip
I&#39;ve tried to portforward... BUT I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TOO..
I need help Urgently..

Ok, i am Really serious the 1st one who can actually make me portforward successfully and so my server is Public, i will give you the Server name.. and i will make you Admininistrator, i am positive!

[hr]
