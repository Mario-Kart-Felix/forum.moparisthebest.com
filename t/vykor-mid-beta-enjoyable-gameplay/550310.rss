[center][b]About Vykor[/b][/center]
Vykor is a new upcoming server created and founded by, yours truly. Vykor aims to provide the highest quality of gameplay for players to enjoy their time spent online. We aim to create an environment for players to obtain a high total level and a bank load of goodies without ever having to lose their earnings anytime soon. Dedicated hosting, as well as website hosting has been paid for, for a year in advance and by that time will have accumulated enough funding to continue hosting.

[center][b]Vykor status:[/b][/center]
Vykor is currently online and in a mid-beta stage. What does this mean? This means while the server is in a &#39;beta&#39; stage, character accounts will not be reset anytime soon, as all known serious bugs/dupes have been fixed. No reset may be necessary unless serious problems occur.

[center][b]Features[/b][/center]
- Toggle-able features, such as gameframes, in-game aesthetic features (etc.).
- A well set economy. All drop rates and prices have been set at a standard that leaves players with a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day.
- Many bosses to enjoy hours of NPC domination at chances for rare loots! (Godwars, Tormented Demon, etc.)
- Various skills to enjoy endless skilling as well as highscores to show off your in-game accomplishments.
- In-game PK&#39;ing highscores to show off your skills to everyone! Gain the ladders to become #1.
- 100% Bank tabs.

<p>Thank you. I, as well as “Zee” from r-s spent countless hours getting those forums up, I refused to even advertise this without some decent looking forums. It’s a must have. However other website pages as well as a homepage is still in development. We do only have a forum board.</p>
