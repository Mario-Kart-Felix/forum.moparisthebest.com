              <p>I simply love when people take the time to copy some of my work. It might not be a big deal to others and might make me seem big-headed (not to mention what I feel proud about) but I take proud about how I formatted the sections and boards on the communities I’ve help built, and forums I’ve done simply because of how much time I took into consideration of each and every board. From you, the sections and boards were taken from Ikov (or at least another community that I put the sections and boards as such) because of what I took into consideration and how I made them. I also see you’ve copied Ikov’s veteran rank (don’t care for the others as they were not unique).</p>
