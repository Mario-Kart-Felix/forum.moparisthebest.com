    <title>Moral Nihilism</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moral-nihilism/401537</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Moral nihilism, also known as ethical nihilism, is the meta-ethical view that morality does not exist as something inherent to objective reality; therefore no action is necessarily preferable to any other. For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, for whatever reason, is not inherently right or wrong. Other nihilists may argue not that there is no morality at all, but that if it does exist, it is a human and thus artificial construction, wherein any and all meaning is relative for different possible outcomes. As an example, if someone kills someone else, such a nihilist might argue that killing is not inherently a bad thing, bad independently from our moral beliefs, only that because of the way morality is constructed as some rudimentary dichotomy, what is said to be a bad thing is given a higher negative weighting than what is called good: as a result, killing the individual was bad because it did not let the individual live, which was arbitrarily given a positive weighting. In this way a moral nihilist believes that all moral claims are false.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
tl;dr: are there really such things as universal morals and such?

<p>Remember these are just words we have given them so we can communicate with each other. In another language and I wouldn’t be surprised if this was true somewhere they could use the same word for both!</p>
<p>I may have misunderstood what you were asking though, but just remember language, social gestures/actions are all methods of communication we have developed. The universe had no way of telling what was moral or ethical (as these “words” or concepts don’t really exist (imo)) . I’ll leave this post here as I’m going to go off on one but consider what caused humans to develop a conscience. if you were brought up a few hundred years ago as the son of a slave master murderer you wouldn’t care for these things. Especially when murder and pillaging was more common and accepted as part of “life”.</p>

              <p>“Just surviving” would become dull to any intelligent being. Morality would be needed to sustain a more enjoyable existence for the majority. The keyword is <span class="bbcode-b">majority</span> of course, since it’s they who would create morality and its terms. Absolute morality could not exist if it were created by beings (such as humans) with swaying opinions. The majority used to think that the banning of homosexual marriage would make them happier, but people are changing and more people are openly gay… so that’ll soon be changed in many places where it hasn’t already been.<br>
If the majority believed that murder was acceptable, then it’d be considered moral (or rather, <span class="bbcode-i">not immoral</span>). To say murder is inherently immoral it to claim there exists a governing force for everything natural. Even most people who believe in God don’t believe in universal morality. For instance, in Christianity, God <span class="bbcode-b">used</span> to demand punishment absolutely for any breaking of a strict law (basically universal morality), but then that was changed with the advent of Jesus who basically taught how immoral things are judge according to the circumstances. Most believers of God follow those teachings of Jesus rather than the former absolute justice of the old laws.<br>
So whether from a religious perspective or not, I’d definitely say absolute morality is silly.<br>
And if you don’t believe in God, I think believing morality to be anything other than a creation of man is idiotic.</p>

<p>How does the concept of the alpha male exist without the idea of strong vs. weak? I’d say the animal kingdom is BUILT on strong vs. weak, see: animals that puff up when a fight is incoming to appear bigger than they are - when the enemy backs down, is that not them acknowledging that they are not strong enough to overcome them?</p>

              <p>I think that morals only work locally, ie. they only work with certain people depending on what you think. You can have all the morals you want, if the other person does not care about them then he will just proceed to do whatever he wants. Also morals are defined by the culture they are lived by, so if for example person X goes to planet Y, and the people of planet Y have different morals than person X, they will not work.</p>

              <p>Morality is certainly artificial in the sense that it is a social construct of humans alone.</p>
<p>Consider these four dichotomies: good and bad, right and wrong, strong and weak, winning and losing.<br>
Obviously this discussion concerns itself with the first two, but these four dichotomies are ingrained in every member of society from a young age through education and discipline.</p>
<p>In the animal world, none of those exist. Animals merely do what they must to survive.<br>
For example, the lion hunts and kills various wildlife when it needs to eat. But at other times, it doesn’t. It doesn’t hunt them at certain times of day because it’s bad, nor does it demonstrate compassion at other times of day when it leaves other animals in peace – it merely eats when it needs to so that it survives.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, humans weren’t so different. Nowadays we centre our existence around compassion, and so it is natural to teach people that it’s wrong to harm others.<br>
If you hear or say something often enough, you come to believe it.<br>
And that’s what morality is really – a set of ideals that most people come to accept as true through education and the right type of upbringing.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>Moral nihilism, also known as ethical nihilism, is the meta-ethical view that morality does not exist as something inherent to objective reality; therefore no action is necessarily preferable to any other. For example, a moral nihilist would say that killing someone, for whatever reason, is not inherently right or wrong. Other nihilists may argue not that there is no morality at all, but that if it does exist, it is a human and thus artificial construction, wherein any and all meaning is relative for different possible outcomes. As an example, if someone kills someone else, such a nihilist might argue that killing is not inherently a bad thing, bad independently from our moral beliefs, only that because of the way morality is constructed as some rudimentary dichotomy, what is said to be a bad thing is given a higher negative weighting than what is called good: as a result, killing the individual was bad because it did not let the individual live, which was arbitrarily given a positive weighting. In this way a moral nihilist believes that all moral claims are false.</blockquote>
tl;dr: are there really such things as universal morals and such?
