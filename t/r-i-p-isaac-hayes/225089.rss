    <description>On August 10, 2008, Hayes&#39; wife found him on the floor near a treadmill inside his home located just east of Memphis, Tennessee. A Shelby County, Tennessee sheriff&#39;s deputy responded to Hayes&#39; home. He was taken to Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis, where he was pronounced dead at 2:08pm, at the age of 65. The cause of death was not immediately known, though the stroke he suffered in 2006 is considered a factor. At the time of his death, he was preparing his first new studio album since 1995
