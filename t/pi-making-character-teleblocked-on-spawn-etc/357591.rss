    <title>(PI) Making character teleblocked on spawn etc</title>

    <description>I have a npc that you choose an option of which side to go
that being varrock/fally, how would i edit in to make your character teleblocked when it&#39;s created, so they can&#39;t tele off normally without choosing a side, then the npc would set the player as un teleblocked?
is it possible? 

thanks, jeddac :)</description>
