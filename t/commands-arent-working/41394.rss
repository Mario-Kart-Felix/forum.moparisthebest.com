    <title>Commands aren&#39;t working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/commands-arent-working/41394</link>
    <description>The only commands I have that work are the ones that were originally in my client, and I&#39;m using Phonescape V2.0 as my source. I added in my commands, showed them to Sven and she fixed one, but it didn&#39;t work, and I thought it was a problem with my Compiler, so I reinstalled everything, and my compiler worked, I get on, but the commands still don&#39;t work, help please? Also, on the Runserver thing, when it shows the commands I typed, no errors show up, it&#39;ll just say like teh crafterz-playercommand:archer or something, no errors though. :(</description>
