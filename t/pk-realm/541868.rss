    <title>PK Realm</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-realm/541868</link>
    <description>Hey, This is a purely pk server, if you are into that then you will have fun on here. I am just launching so therefore we have no current players. I have made a temporary site and if we get some success I will make a much better paid site. Until then its just gonna have to do. If you must hate/flame go ahead, it makes no difference to me. This also may not be as appealing as all the other advertisements but with my previous server running experience I have never once had a complain that the server was not fun. I urge you to try it out if you actually like pking, if it grows to a decent size it can be very fun. If you don&#39;t want to then its cool too.

I enjoy pking and so do others so I will actively involve myself in the server and interact with community, I have ran servers in the past, some have been successes but some have been failures, I hope to make this a success, nothing too big. Just  decent sized community of people who love to pk.
