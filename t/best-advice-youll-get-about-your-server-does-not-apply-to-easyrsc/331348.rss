    <description>Drop windows+apache combos. I don&#39;t know if people are generally retarded or just too lazy to do their research but it seems too many focus on actual game code for optimizing server performance (*cough* Kryptix), yet still see their web servers load like shit. 

Have you noticed RSCA is the ONLY server that loads quickly on the fly when it&#39;s not under attack? KO9/Pets actually did their research and found ways of improving speed/performance and stability, 1/2 of which can be just as easily as setting it up in the right platform with the right tools. Yes, it&#39;s important to have a decent host, but do you really need to spend $300+ for some shit win32 server to just increase CPU usage until it lags itself out from high loads? Why do you think most if not ALL high end companies use the linux/unix environment to run their shit? 

It&#39;s not hard to learn Linux, for a computer-saavy idiot like myself, I was able to learn simple - medium terminal commands within an hour or so (or you can setup the GUI that&#39;s usually pre-installed like the Ubuntu distro). Once you&#39;ve done this, now drop apache (as it&#39;s proven to be a resource wasting piece of garbage), and download LiteSpeed(litespeedtech.com) (yes it&#39;s faster than you think, tested it myself and can generate pages in less than a few seconds), hell it even has a decent UI if you&#39;re completely retarded and need help with it&#39;s settings. It even offers load balancing (which generally can increase performance up to x3) with high amount of traffic being generated. 

You save money (linux boxes are generally cheaper), improve performance (you can lie and disagree all you want, i&#39;ve seen it for myself), and actually have something over RSCE. AMG!!!1111</description>

              <p>Not bad. With RSCD_v25 on a CENTOS5 VPS I was averaging about a gig of ram usage between a world server and listening server. Xms and xmx had been set properly but the heap space required to run the JVM was far more inflated than it was on Windows. It may have been the virtualization that had been installed by the host though.</p>

              <p>I don’t get why this post was made to “attempt” to flame Kryptix. If someone chooses to use windows because thats the OS that they know how to use rather than using an OS that they aren’t comfortable with, its their decision. There are pros and cons to using the windows OS in his situation, and theres also pros and cons to using linux in his situation. It evens out and is probably better for his server to run a windows system until he learns more about the linux system.</p>

<p>I’ve never once defended Windows or Apache, I’d switch to Linux in a heartbeat if I was 100% comfortable with it but I know full well something will happen that I’m not completely sure about and will take an age for me to fix, and I don’t want to put players through that downtime. You act like I’m in denial and argue that it’s the best option or something… Simply not the case.</p>
