    <description>I finally took some pictures of my tractor while I was taking pictures of my garage progress (click for bigger pics):

It&#39;s a 1951 Ford 8n (the only ford I&#39;ll ever own :P).  It has a flathead in-line 4 cylinder with a ground-pounding 25 horse power and 20 ft-lbs of torque.  :)  It&#39;ll still pull about anything I want it to because it is geared so low, it&#39;s got 4 forward gears and a reverse.  Top speed in 4th gear is about 15 mph.

I bought it from my cousin with a finish mower on the back of it, and it was a mess.  Since then I bought that front-end loader for it, and a bush hog.  I put that on, made that grill myself, replaced the radiator, carb, intake/exhaust manifold (one piece), spark plugs, points and condenser, and converted it from the original 6v system with a generator to 12v with an alternator, rewiring the entire thing.  It&#39;s been fun, and it helps out around here alot, much of the dirt you can see in the garage pictures was dug out with this little tractor.

After the barn is finished and I have a place to store it out of the weather, I&#39;m going to sandblast the rust off and paint it back original colors (sheet metal grey, rest red).

Anyway, there it is. :)</description>
