    <title>Infinite amount of single item in shops? allstar source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/infinite-amount-of-single-item-in-shops-allstar-source/526356</link>
    <description>Hello, i&#39;ve been having trouble trying to add an infinite amount of an item to a shop. For example, Bob&#39;s brilliant axes. I would like to have it so it&#39;s showing 1 in stock but is actually a never ending amount. Is there a way to do that? I know shops.cfg holds that information but not sure how i can do it. I have tried to use &quot;-1&quot; however, it was a failure. Any help would be appreciated.</description>

<p>You edit the code in your shoppingmanager that when in the cfg file you stated - 1, it should display 1 and not substract any items from the shop when an item has been bought.</p>
