    <title>Thought Exercise - Abstracting MoparCoders from the more Esoteric Parad</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thought-exercise-abstracting-moparcoders-from-the-more-esoteric-parad/375660</link>
    <description>Edit:

Consider this more of a thought exerciser 

-------

Every Software Engineer, Computer Scientist, Programmer, Code Monkey, w/e has meet &#39;That Guy&#39;. You know That Guy who just wrote his first web page in HTML and started proclaiming to the world how awesome his Uber programming skillz are, how he could do what you do in a matter of weeks, maybe even days if he has his favorite IDE (Photoshop) by his side. Yes, we all have meet That Guy.

Well, something that may shock you, they won&#39;t be able to do what you do in a matter of days, let alone weeks. Infact, it would take years. Shocked? Of course not. That Guy isn&#39;t a programmer, and chances are never will be. But that is O.K.

Users were not meant to be programmers. Programmers were meant to be programmers. Users tend to have little desire to learn how something works on their own, little desire to try to fix something (or even think about how one would fix it) before asking someone else or making someone else fix it.

I believe you would agree with me in saying that the majority of the people on this site are not meant to be programmers. That makes the majority of the people on this site are Users. 

So, this makes me curious on why exactly we are throwing &quot;all that is programming&quot; at Users. Users don&#39;t care, they just want what they want and they want it now! If it doesn&#39;t work right out of the box it&#39;s broke (so far as not compiled, Java not installed, etc.) and someone needs to help them fix it or fix it for them.

This has caused a lot of butting heads and needs to be fixed. But how?

I was browsing around the forum like I do from time to time just to see whats been going on and I came accross Yz85Racer&#39;s [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,309081.0.htm]317Serv[/url]. And this peticular line in his post caught my attention.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I was a little annoyed with all of the wL bases, and people to lazy to use rsd2v, so I began writing a base which wasn&#39;t hard to use, but still implied full use of correct Java programming procedures.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

IMO that is the most beautiful organization of words I have read on this site. It makes 4 basic points describing the problem.


[ol][li]Users cannot be trusted to program. Who doesn&#39;t die a little inside when they see that 50k line God Object found in client.java?[/li]
[li]Users don&#39;t care about making a correct solution. Why should they bother to learn how rsd2v&#39;s framework is set up? &quot;Thats hard =[, I like client.java it&#39;s soooo easy! Plus I dev faster!!! ^.^&quot;[/li]
[li]I want to attempt to give them a base to work with that isn&#39;t &quot;Hard&quot;. Something they can actually manage[/li]
[li]I still want to maintain my values (Code Quality) when providing them with this &#39;base&#39; that they can work with easily.[/li][/ol]


Perfect! Beautiful! Impossible.... 

Point 3 &amp; 4 cannot co-exist if you still give the User Java. It&#39;s still going to be hard unless you sacrifise your values. And we know you cannot sacrifise your values, how could you live with yourself? (Not Sarcastic at All)

Well, what I suggest to solve this problem (finally-This guy took forever to get to the point) is some form of End-User Development.

VBA is a very good example of End-User Development. Most of us wouldn&#39;t get caught writing VBA, and for the simple fact that the Users on this site don&#39;t understand why we wouldn&#39;t is the same reason why it&#39;s perfect for them.

VBA provides a very narrow library providing ONLY what the User needs, and that is exactly the opposite of what our Users are exposed to [aka, everything].

Perhaps the first question to ask is what is it that Users do [usually]. The majority of servers only vary from location of shops, commands, models in the cache, messages sent at random intervals of gameplay, etc. 

For the most part, I&#39;m against that kind of &quot;Development&quot;. But I have a feeling if there was some &#39;base&#39; that offered that without any Java/XML Files/Txt Files it would greatly reduce the amount of plain crap on this site allowing for something useful to actually be done by the few programmers actually here.

the fact that a plugin defining “staff areas” consists of 100 kb (or 97.7 kb if you were on windows) uncompressed in classes is completely fucking ridiculous and shows how bloated your overall server must be<br>
[/quote]<br>
Its actually 49 KB if you look at the first screenshot, files less then 4 KB appear as 4 KB because of the block size of the hard drive. And also, <span class="bbcode-b">you have no idea what you are talking about</span>. You make up fake arguments like this because you can’t do this yourself. If you honestly do believe that it is my fault for creating “bloated” bytecode or ZIP files, you seriously need a reality check on how programming and Java works. The capacity of hard disks is now in the terabyte range, I doubt that 49 KB for a plugin matters, and the memory usage and performance of the server are well beyond anything you, or anyone else, has shown. Additionally, you seem like love to argue about nothing, because that is essentially what we are doing. As moparisthebest said, this is something completely irrelevant to the server. <span class="bbcode-b">I am the one who has already proved multiple times that my approach has been the most successful so far, and I am not saying that it is the best way, but right now it beats everything else.</span> I have no problem debating real issues with other people, but you are obsessing over a small and irrelevant detail, which just makes you ignorant.</p>
<p>The fact that you try and make these kinds are arguments and obsess over these details demonstrates how unsuccessful you must be at programming things that are actually used.[/quote]its 49 kb… COMPRESSED you fucking retard, note how i explicitly said uncompressed. and regardless, even 49kb is fucking monstrous for such a simple plugin</p>
<p>how the fuck would you know that i cant do this myself? because i havent spent the past three years working on it like you have? there’s a difference between incapability and a lack of devotion</p>
<p>your approach being ‘the most successful so far’ is anything but a feat considering the utter lack of competition</p>
<p>and since you’ve seen to missed the point by a long fucking shot so far, let me reiterate: <span class="bbcode-b">YOUR SHIT IS FUCKING BLOATED</span>. your obnoxiousness provides hilarity as you think your server is the shit for having made a video showing nothing but support for 2000 players – which, again, isn’t a feat</p>
<p>ps considering the atrocity of the little you have shown of your server as far as the internal workings go, it most likely is nothing more but an overrated pile of shit</p>

<p>So you blame me for:</p>
<ol>
<li>The size of the bytecode that javac creates.</li>
<li>The size of the JAR file due to the ZIP compression algorithm.</li>
<li>The fact that Snow Leopard defines a KB as 1000 bytes instead of 1024 bytes.</li>
</ol>
<p>That makes sense. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Do you have any other comments or suggestions about the actual system as opposed to something completely irrelevant?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Currently, the configuration system is very basic. The configuration file for a plugin is read as a every two lines being a key/value pair, and then those values are added to a Map and made available to the plugin. There is also a configuration file for the whole server that works the same way, except the values are accessible to the entire server. If plugins wish to load additional files, they can do so.</p>
<p>As far as the binding to the actual application, the system is mostly event based. On startup, plugins register listeners for events with the server, such as a listener for when the player clicks option one on a certain object ID, or when the player logs in, and so on. There are some slight exceptions to listener model, the main thing being the area system. Plugins can register new areas with the server to change the combat setting there, or change the music, or to be notified when entities enter or leave that area. These are registered along with regular listeners, and the server automatically sorts them out and uses them correctly.</p>
<p>Also, if this is such as non-innvative system, why has everyone here been talking about developing a new server for <span class="bbcode-b">YEARS</span>, yet barely anyone has actually done it and made real progress with such a server? We shouldn’t be having topics about how to develop a new 317 server, we should have a server by now. I’ve provided benchmarks of this servers performance and demonstrated what it can do, and am open to constructive criticism, not flaming.</p>

<p>Thats one of the points I was trying to make. We shouldn’t be having a discussion about designed a server, its been years, there should be an actual server. I have no control over the size of a JAR file created by Netbeans, and no one has actually commented about the plugin system itself besides Lothy.</p>

<p>The file size is first because Mac OS X Snow Leopard uses 1000 bytes as 1 KB instead of 1024 bytes, making every file seem bigger. Second, here is the contents if you are really that curious about it, and please note that 4 KB files are actually &lt; 4 KB, its just their size on the disk:<br>

<p>Plus, the point of putting it in a JAR file is so that you can drag and drop disable it. You can put multiple plugins in one JAR file, but then you need to edit a configuration file to disable only a specific plugin in that JAR file.</p>

<p>I think this would probably be the best solution to our problem, mainly because this is the approach that I have taken, and it actually works extremely well. Basically, it is as you said, you have plugins folder where plugins that are built for that version of the ‘base’ are placed, and the server goes through them on startup and loads them up. Then, it loads configuration files that can set variables to pass to a plugin, and that plugin can change things such as messages or XP rate based on that configuration.<br>

<p>I think this would be the simplest approach to use, because it is an easy drag and drop for the server owner, and then editing configuration files shouldn’t be too hard for them to do with all the .cfg files they have now. Plus, I know that it works.</p>

              <p>Disregard the process of development and just go ahead with a project. Start out with a few developers to write the ‘core’ of the server. By ‘core’ I mean networking, updating etc. These few developers should concentrate on making the server more ‘plugin-oriented’ because a majority of people in the RSPS scene <span class="bbcode-i">still</span> just download a source, stuff code from tutorials into their almighty client.java and run that server. That said, most of the time they copy and paste the code wrongly and face compiling errors which can be easily fixed.</p>
<p>With the idea of plugins, they can instead download a plugin into the plugin folder and run the server with ease. Most importantly, basic configuration for the specific plugin should all be parsed from a file, so they can easily change the messages to send without ruining the plugin with even more errors. RS2 server development will be similar to Minecraft server developments, people write plugins instead of adding onto the original server’s source.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Original developers release a source with an unmodifiable base for plugin developers to write plugins. MoparScapers can download plugins and run their servers with a click!</p>
