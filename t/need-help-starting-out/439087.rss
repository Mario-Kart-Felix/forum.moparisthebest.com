    <title>Need help starting out</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-starting-out/439087</link>
    <description>As you can see from the title I&#39;m looking for a good source to start out on. I&#39;m trying to find a (preferably 317) and learn more about RSPS code and also I&#39;m going to be hosting it for my brother, some friends, and I. If you have any good sources that you think would be good for me to start coding feel free to reply. :)

Also sorry is this is posted in wrong section, I read the sub-forum rules and i&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m in the right place.

<p>Also, there’s no right answer to your question… It’s Java period, there is no right source. If you want a well-programmed framework look at runesource, but it’s a bit bare-bones. That’s typically why people stray over to servers such as PI (Project Insanity) as you typically get burnt out adding  the necessities before you even begin content and so the project dies <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
