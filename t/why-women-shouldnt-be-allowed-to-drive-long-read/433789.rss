    <description>Yea so I finished work yesterday.. going along the road that was full of standstill traffic on the otherside, my side was clear.. was going 30mph and then i saw a car poke its nose out of a junction... So i did the correct thing, lift my foot off the throttle and cover the brakes... Im watching her to see what shes doing and then all of a sudden without even looking into my direction she pulls out leaving me with not enough time to stop and i hit her writing off my car:

[img]http://bit.ly/xAQ0mD[/img]
[IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/crash026.jpg[/img]

So yea... when it happened the airbag went off... i shout at her &quot;WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING&quot; i try opening my door and it wouldnt open so i hard to force it open, I get out ready to go skitz on her but i calm down when someone asks if im alright, i ring the ambulance and police and when i get off the phone im like.. &quot;Wait a minute, where are my glasses???&quot; (They had flown off my face and landed on the dash when the airbag went off) the guy that asked me if i was alright asks her to move her car back out the road.. i ask her if shes alright and she nods her head.

Shortly after that she sneakily gets out her car with her kid that was in the car with her and walks up to her house without me seeing... Her husband comes down, (at this time im thinking he was the guy that got out and asked if i was okay due to shock but it was her husband) He asks my insurance details and then is like.. &quot;Ive got a witness saying you accelerated into her&quot; to which i reply... &quot;Err i dont think i did mate for a start its not the strongest car, (1 nstar rating in safety)&quot; and then he&#39;s like.. &quot;who was the guy who ran from your car&quot; im like... What the fuck mate.. i was on my own... &quot;well my son said he knows the person&quot; i mean what the fuck dude.. anyway police turned up shortly after and hes there saying i was flying (but he said i accelerated into her so that contradicts what he said right there) Police just said its an insurance matter now...

I get home later on, shaken but in one piece, I ring my insurance company and they tell me im never gonna be at fault... Even if i was speeding, They tell me i can also get a hire car provided by her insurance to which im like.. &quot;Oh okay thanks&quot; so they say okay we will arrange it for you, you just need to accept the terms via email, so anyway i ring them this morning at 10:30am saying i havent received the email (I had infact recieved it in my spam DOH) and i accept it and they say they would ring me right back.... Gets to 12:30 and i ring them saying i havent had a call to which they reply and they say Yes its all goen through and i should receive a hire car by 3pm... It comes at 1:20pm, A Brand new hyundai I10 with only 40 miles on the clock to which i have for up to 49 weeks whilst my claim is being sorted at a cost of £50 a day to her insurance (OUCH)... 

Shortly after receiving the car i have a phone call from her insurance saying &quot;Just to let you know we are accepting full liability&quot;, Thats good. by this time all the left side of my body is aching... my chest is killing from the airbag and i have a small cut / burn on my chin from the airbag too.. also had a bruised and cut shin so i shall be claiming for those too. Would have gone easier on her if had just accepted it straight away without sending her husband down trying to blame it on me, Not once did she speak to me or ask if i was okay, So fuck her im taking her for everything i can legally claim for, (And no... I&#39;m not gonna be making injurys up, i will be claiming for just the ones i received)

should hopefully be a quick and easy case.


EDIT: Will post a picture of her car&#39;s damage is requested.. its hardly done anything to it...

Also Ironicly for anyone who have heard the game &quot;Mini punch no return&quot; Me and my friend have been going out for drives alot since i passed my test in october, The past couple times we&#39;ve gone out ive been playing the game with her... and she&#39;s always said &quot;Ill get you back one day&quot; And yea.. It was a bloody mini that pulled out on me,I think i can safely say i got well and truely mini punched!

EDIT2: [IMG]http://i27.photobucket.com/albums/c163/i_kill_muhah/crash033.jpg[/img]

So yea, If you want to be safe from the side, Buy a mini!</description>

              <p>Went to my driving course for speeding. Was actually quite good, the 2 guys doing it were ex police and they were basically telling us how to not get caught and be a safe driver.</p>
<p>They said the bottom line is do not speed between 30-60. If you’re on a motorway with a 70 speed limit the consequences of you going 80 and hitting something is going to have almost the same result as hitting it at 70. Though if you’re in a 30 zone and going 40, hitting someone at 30 80% chance they’ll live, hitting someone at 40 80% chance they’ll die.</p>
<p>I was doing 83 in a 70 so I’m morally good woo.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:26, topic:433789”]What stinks is that it’s still going to go on your record that you were in an accident and your insurance rates will go up.  If you have a chance to lock your brakes up to avoid an accident like this, do it every time.  Sorry for your luck.</p>
<p>Also, get a tougher car next time, that thing folded like a cheap suit, I wouldn’t feel safe driving it around. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Nope, my insurance wont go up as she was at fault… Hers won’t go up too much either if she has protected no claims bonus</p>
<p>And about the car, Yea its 1 star ncap which is the worse for safety, However at £150 for a car that had 5 months MOT and 7 months tax and nothing wrong with it, It was an ideal first car… Just a shame it had to die like it did.</p>
<p>EDIT, rang the guys that came out to write it off… they valued it at £844 so that will be a nice little cheque that comes through in a ocuple weeks… and theres my injury claim yet too <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
