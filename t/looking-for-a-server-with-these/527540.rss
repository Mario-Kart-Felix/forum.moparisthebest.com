    <title>Looking for a server with these</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-server-with-these/527540</link>
    <description>I have been serching all over for a server that meets my criteria and have had bad luck. Here is what I am looking for:


Donators do not get advantages over non donators. Just cosmetic if anything

Fully working construction and able to start said skill

100x or more xp rate

No SOF

A working webclient (I do not want to download a client)

No double xp/item drop/ect for the weekends

Not a pk server (can have a pking area, just not most of the server)

No gambling

No pk ranks

Does not glitch when you click on equipment stats (seems to be a common problem with servers I try)

Shops have correct prices displayed both below the icon and when clicking info/value

No vote for rewards

No forcing players to vote

No account resets


If you do not like this topic, then please leave. I seem to attract a lot of posters who make comments that are off topic.</description>
