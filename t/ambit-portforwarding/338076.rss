              <p>ahh port forwarding, a major pain in the ass. if you have a router figure out the ip by going to cmd(command prompt) and typing in ipgonfig/all you want to look for the default gateway, that is the ip yu want. then go to the internet and type that in, it will prompt yu for a username and pass. if yu havn’t changed it, it should still be admin and password. if yu have a netgear router it will say port forwarding/port triggering on the side, click on that. then yu can figure it out from there keep the default selections, all yu need to do is enter the name, ip, and port.</p>
<p>NOTE: if yu have windows vista yu need to right click on cmd and click on run as administrator or it wont work, and the ipconfig/all will give yu a big list, it will say local, or wireless depending on what type of connection yu are using. MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE RIGHT ONE. and also when imputting the ip while portforwarding make sure it isin’t the router’s ip. i.e. if your ip was 1.2.3.4 you would want to use 1.2.3.5 or something.</p>
