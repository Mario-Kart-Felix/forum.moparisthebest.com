    <title>What Server base should i use...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-server-base-should-i-use/128673</link>
    <description>Hello, i am looking for a Stable source that will be good for my Server. I have already made it, but the server has so many errors in the script, and is really laggy, i have decided to Remake it with a better source.

This is what people have recomended, but i am trying to back it up with what others think, so please, take a look -

- Pimpscape
- Testscape
- Bakascape
- CheezScape

those are the sources people have recommended.

Also, my friend said i should re-build my own server with winterloves base source, But i am not very good with java, so there is no way i am going to code a whole client.java. Please, Give me some ideas :)

[b]my goal in this topic -[/b] My goal is to find a stable source and learn from it, add lots onto it, and than use it as my server. 


Also! It would help if you guys post what server bases you used for your servers.

Thanks --- Chris ----</description>
