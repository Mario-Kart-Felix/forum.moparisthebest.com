Our Server is an Economy Server, Meaning there is no spawning, people skill in order to get items/gold. The economy goes around with players skilling and selling what they get. There are no instant leveling commands, so maxing out is part of the expirence. The exp rate is Enormous, maxing out a skill may take you from 20 minutes to 2 hours depending on the skills. There are plenty of commands! The server is 24/7, and has a very experienced team which has run an RSPS prior to this! there is a working Donation and Voting system, so remember to vote every day!
Notable skills that we have that most other servers dont have is SUMMONING, CONSTRUCTION, and DUNGEONEERING to lvl 120!

<p>Iv’e been on this server for a good few days, and so far it’s been a great experience! It’s regularly updated, and the suggestions you make on the forums are almost always taken into consideration, which in my opinion is very important. Because after all, players are the most important asset to a server, so being heard is quite useful. There’s a great community, and it’s also very easy to get along with all players and staff alike. If you’re interested in a server that will provide you with a great experience, and keep you entertained at the same time, then come join Wyrdscape today!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
