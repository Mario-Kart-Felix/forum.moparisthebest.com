    <description>Alright, well, i followed every possible tutorial that s found in tutorials section, and everywhere else, and something always goes wrong when i try to make my server... MY JDK  :mad: :eek: :confused:!!!  Anyways, i have this in my java folder : jdk1.6.0_03 , jre1.6.0 , jre1.6.0_03 &lt;-- I have all of those folders in my java folder in program files, but for some reason i always have my compiler send a message like this : error....you seem to not have JDK 5 or JDK 6 ..... but as you read above i obviously do. I did a little more research and apparently i need netbeans, or do i ? anyways , if i do , please post me a link to where i can download it, or if i dont need netbeans , then tell me whats wrong

Thanks, Mike :)</description>
