    <title>Computer makes 1 long beep, doesn&#39;t start up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-makes-1-long-beep-doesnt-start-up/536223</link>
    <description>So today I decided to clean my computer&#39;s fan (above the heatsink). I took out the fan, brought it outside, and cleaned it with compressed air. I usually clean it with just a vacuum because I don&#39;t feel like taking out the fan, but I decided I should take out the fan today. When I finished cleaning the fan, I looked at all the shit over the heatsink. I took a vacuum (with a plastic top) and cleaned the heatsink with that. I didn&#39;t blow any compressed air into the heatsink. Then, I put the fan back over the heatsink and snapped everything into place, except I forgot to plug the fan back into the motherboard. I turned on the computer and I got 1 long beep and no visual, then unplugged the computer 2 seconds later. I plugged the fan into the motherboard then turned the computer back on. The long beep was still there. It does require a little bit of effort to put the fan back into place. I contacted Geek Squad about the issue and multiple people told me to bring it in because they can&#39;t see it, so I attached pictures. Why is my computer making a long beep? It&#39;s a Gateway DX4860-UB33P computer, the warranty expired, it has an Intel i5 processor. I took out the CMOS battery for 15 seconds because some website somewhere said that might help (and it didn&#39;t do anything). I haven&#39;t upgraded this computer at all, everything is stock. All the information can be found here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883113202

<p>Yes, I looked at the POST beep codes. I didn’t remove the heatsink, I just stuck a vacuum in there and cleaned it. The computer is working now for whatever reason, I’m actually using it right now. Everything went back to normal when I removed the RAM, blew on it, and re-inserted it.</p>
<p>Is there a free hardware test I can run to make sure everything is working properly and the computer won’t take a shit?</p>
<p>Also my BIOS is American Megatrends Inc. P02-A1 (date 8/1/2011), I wasn’t able to get that information when I had no visual.</p>

<p>Depends on the air compressor, the one I own is a air compressor typically found in car shops with the big tank, I assumed he had the same because he had to take it outside. I also have a small air compressor that just plugs into my car which doesn’t spit out air that fast, regardless it is still a possibility. He didn’t include the specifics. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>No I didn’t, I touched the side of the case while it was plugged in. I’ll buy some anti-static gloves and re-seat the RAM. I unplugged 1 of the sticks and pushed it back in very carefully, and now <span class="bbcode-s">I get 2 beeps</span> it turns on and works. When I turn on the computer, it spins all the fans and gets ready to turn on, then turns off, and turns back on again a few seconds later. I may bring it into a local repair shop just to be safe.</p>

              <p>I’d double check everything is plugged into the motherboard properly. You might have dislodged something trying to get the fan out and back in (like you said it requires a bit of effort to get it back into place)</p>

              <p>So today I decided to clean my computer’s fan (above the heatsink). I took out the fan, brought it outside, and cleaned it with compressed air. I usually clean it with just a vacuum because I don’t feel like taking out the fan, but I decided I should take out the fan today. When I finished cleaning the fan, I looked at all the shit over the heatsink. I took a vacuum (with a plastic top) and cleaned the heatsink with that. I didn’t blow any compressed air into the heatsink. Then, I put the fan back over the heatsink and snapped everything into place, except I forgot to plug the fan back into the motherboard. I turned on the computer and I got 1 long beep and no visual, then unplugged the computer 2 seconds later. I plugged the fan into the motherboard then turned the computer back on. The long beep was still there. It does require a little bit of effort to put the fan back into place. I contacted Geek Squad about the issue and multiple people told me to bring it in because they can’t see it, so I attached pictures. Why is my computer making a long beep? It’s a Gateway DX4860-UB33P computer, the warranty expired, it has an Intel i5 processor. I took out the CMOS battery for 15 seconds because some website somewhere said that might help (and it didn’t do anything). I haven’t upgraded this computer at all, everything is stock.
