    <title>Scape-JAVA/` SJ_ for Server Helper badge</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scape-java-sj--for-server-helper-badge/453960</link>
    <description>Hello, staff team.

I&#39;m writing this post to nominate the user Scape-JAVA for the Server Helper award/badge. I believe he&#39;d be perfect for this position, he is an asset to MoparScape and should be awarded rightfully. I realise he is an ex-moderator, which shows the community think highly of him.

His post count is currently around 5000 and 1750(ish) of those are in the Server Help board. Every time I see him reply to a thread, or the majority of the time, it&#39;s a decent reply with a good logic behind it.

I believe he deserves this, however the decision is yours.

Best Regards,
Ruby.</description>
