<p>… Sorry strayed off topic lets get back to it.</p>
<p>Now, Free will theories are a weird topic for me. Ofc everyone NOW has freewill, but to go back into time sounds like it would be a different story. Time traveling would create an endless loop. Example the Hitler and Holocaust example. When Hitler is killed, the Holocaust wouldn’t have happened. Without Hitler there is no reason to go back into time to kill Hitler even though Hitler is already dead, but since he wont be killed by someone from the future because he is already dead, he lives and the Holocaust survives. See where i’m going?</p>
<p>But I guess the true answer to this is, we won’t know unless Time travel is discovered, although I highly doubt it will be.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s not the kind of free will that I’m talking about, read the OP.</p>

        <p>I guess first you have to define free will. I define free will as the opportunity to do as you please. Whether or not if someone knows what you are doing, as long as you are doing whatever you want to do, you have free will. However, if the person that was following you could mandate what you could do, then you would no longer have free will.</p>
<p>And as far as those people saying time travel will never exist. Never say never. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> They told the Wright brothers they could never fly and guess what? They flew. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> With a scientific mindset, it is impossible to deem anything impossible, for once you do you have omitted a chance. A perpetual motion machine is almost definitely impossible (because of friction), but that does not make it impossible. It is just highly unlikely with our current understandings of physics (which is very rudimentary, mind you) that one could exist. The same goes for time traveling machines.</p>

However it was your choice to do that defined action. Someone knowing the future (or the past in this example) does not eliminate free will. They just know the outcome of free will. Reminds me of in the Matrix when he meets the Oracle. She says to not mind the vase and he spins around saying what vase and he breaks it. Then she says now what will really get you going is would you have broken it if I said anything. She did not control him, rather she manipulated him. She manipulated his free will knowing that if she said something he would break the vase. People manipulate people all the time right now, without knowing exactly what the outcome will be. They just know typically this is a person’s reaction. However they still have free will.</p>
<p>Hopefully that made some sense. I’m not the best with words so hopefully someone can understand what I am saying and articulate it better.</p>
