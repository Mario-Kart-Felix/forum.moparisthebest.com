    <title>Are time travel and free will mutually exclusive?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/are-time-travel-and-free-will-mutually-exclusive/478510</link>
    <description>I&#39;m going to start this off with a hypothetical scenario as it&#39;s the easiest way of doing it.

Imagine that someone, right now, is following me (and has been following me) for my entire life. They have documented my every single action. Also, imagine that in the future time travel will definitely be invented and used. Now, let&#39;s imagine that in the future, the book containing the documentation of my life becomes available. If someone from the future reads that book and then comes back into the present time, they would know what I am going to do tomorrow, right? Surely that means that the action that I am going to complete tomorrow has already been completed as the person who came back from the future would know what I am going to do?
And also, before anyone says that I could simply choose to do a different action, when I did that then the documentation would end up different and the person who came back from the future would still know what I am going to do tomorrow.

So, from the scenario that I&#39;ve posted above, can time travel exist in the same space as free will?</description>

<p>[quote author=The Wanderer link=topic=596733.msg4289864#msg4289864 date=1367043866]I guess first you have to define free will. I define free will as the opportunity to do as you please. Whether or not if someone knows what you are doing, as long as you are doing whatever you want to do, you have free will. However, if the person that was following you could mandate what you could do, then you would no longer have free will.</p>

<p>I meant free will as in the opportunity to entirely decide what you do, however surely if a person from the future knows what you are going to do before you do it, it is not a choice but a defined action?[/quote]<br>
However it was your choice to do that defined action. Someone knowing the future (or the past in this example) does not eliminate free will. They just know the outcome of free will. Reminds me of in the Matrix when he meets the Oracle. She says to not mind the vase and he spins around saying what vase and he breaks it. Then she says now what will really get you going is would you have broken it if I said anything. She did not control him, rather she manipulated him. She manipulated his free will knowing that if she said something he would break the vase. People manipulate people all the time right now, without knowing exactly what the outcome will be. They just know typically this is a person’s reaction. However they still have free will.</p>
<p>Hopefully that made some sense. I’m not the best with words so hopefully someone can understand what I am saying and articulate it better.</p>

<p>And as far as those people saying time travel will never exist. Never say never. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> They told the Wright brothers they could never fly and guess what? They flew. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> With a scientific mindset, it is impossible to deem anything impossible, for once you do you have omitted a chance. A perpetual motion machine is almost definitely impossible (because of friction), but that does not make it impossible. It is just highly unlikely with our current understandings of physics (which is very rudimentary, mind you) that one could exist. The same goes for time traveling machines.</p>

<p>Now, Free will theories are a weird topic for me. Ofc everyone NOW has freewill, but to go back into time sounds like it would be a different story. Time traveling would create an endless loop. Example the Hitler and Holocaust example. When Hitler is killed, the Holocaust wouldn’t have happened. Without Hitler there is no reason to go back into time to kill Hitler even though Hitler is already dead, but since he wont be killed by someone from the future because he is already dead, he lives and the Holocaust survives. See where i’m going?</p>
<p>But I guess the true answer to this is, we won’t know unless Time travel is discovered, although I highly doubt it will be.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s not the kind of free will that I’m talking about, read the OP.</p>

Frell. If someone were to go back in time and change the future that screw love up everything. But since were already here in this time period nothing is gonna change we go on by our normal lives. Unless you are the one going back in time everything stays the same. And there’s that little tiny bit of chance that the person stopping the Holocaust will end up killing himself.</p>
