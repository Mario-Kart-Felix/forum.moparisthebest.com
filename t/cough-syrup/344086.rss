    <title>Cough Syrup</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cough-syrup/344086</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve been curious about it and we have it all in the house, I just mixed some hydro codone cough syrup and some coke and drank it and its been a while and I&#39;m feeling pretty good.

But my question is what if I drank more is the high different are there any visuals or is it just this euphoric feeling?

Also I&#39;m out of the codone syrup so I would just be drinking sildec pe-dm syrup.</description>

              <p>What are the active/medicinal ingredients listed on the label? If there are any listed other than hydrocodone, you just put yourself at risk and don’t shouldn’t consume anymore.</p>
<p>The bottle should also list how much hydrocodone is in it. Usually it will say an amount per 15mL (1 tablespoon). How much did you consume?</p>
<p>Hydrocodone shouldn’t make you hallucinate. It’s just an opiate. Stronger then codeine, weaker then morphine. Smoke some pot with it for a more pleasent effect.</p>
<p>Now: You mentioned running out of the hydrocodone syrup, and taking pe-dm syrup. Just because they both come from syrup doesn’t mean the same drug is inside. pe-dm syrup contains chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, and phenylephrine. chlorpheniramine is a delerient and has strange interactions with DXM. Just look up the dangers of using Coricidin Cold and Cough.</p>
<p>Drinking this syrup in recreational doses, is dangerous and likely to be a horrible experience even if it leaves you unharmed.</p>
<p>In my opinion, you need to just stay away from all that shit and get some half-decent drugs. But if you are as stubborn as I was, you won’t take that warning. Hopefully it doesn’t kill you before you learn your lesson.</p>

              <p>Lol omg I did this like, 2 yrs ago with a cough syrup that had 3mg/ml dxm. I drank the whole bottle and after that I was shitting myself cuz the syrup had 500mg/ml SORBITOL, a sugar that works similarly to a laxative I think. Anyways, it didn’t work: all I felt after drinking was lightness, as in I could jump around and not feel it, useless.</p>
