    <description>I&#39;m am not that great with setting up things to connect to a database via mysql. I&#39;m trying to setup a login system and I&#39;m getting this error:
[code] Access denied for user &#39;root&#39;@&#39;localhost&#39; (using password: NO)[/code]
I have a question though, when it asks for the IP of the database, host, or whatever it&#39;s called, what do I put there? Because I&#39;ve seen most people use &#39;localhost&#39;, then some have said to use the actual website IP, and I&#39;ve also seen some people use a remote mysql IP. 

This is what I&#39;m using to connect to the database on my host:
[code]		$connect = mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;root&quot;, &quot;password?&quot;);
		mysql_select_db(&quot;database name&quot;);[/code]
I know what to put in the second line, but what exactly do I put in the first line? Any help is highly appreciated.

Edit: I already have a database and table setup for this.</description>

              <p>It depends. Is mysqld ran on the same server as the web server?</p>
<p>Your error is because you’re not supplying a password for the account. I would also highly recommend against using root in production code. Create a separate user that only has the permissions required to carry out its task.</p>
