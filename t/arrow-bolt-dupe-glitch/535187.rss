    <title>~~ Arrow/bolt Dupe Glitch ~~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/arrow-bolt-dupe-glitch/535187</link>
    <description>Hey guys, you have probably got this question 1000 times, i was just wondering if you could post me the code to stop the arrow dupe glitch, i have tried so many different alternatives and nothing is working. Incase you are un-aware about what this glitch is then it is, for example.

The player has 2 different types of arrows/bolts, he has one bronze arrow and say 100,001 of dragon bolts (e) 
the player places 1 Dragon bolt (e) in the bank (the bolt he would like to dupe) whilst putting one bronze arrow in the arrow inventory slot in the equipment bar, he then puts the 100,000 dragon bolts (e) into the inventory slot, switching places with the bronze arrow and then withdrawing the dragon bolt (e) from the bank.

Withing the inventory now is 1 bronze arrow and 1 dragon bolt (e) (the playing is wielding the 100k d bolts), Next the player trades a random player and once the dragon bolts goes into the trade screen, it turns into 100k d bolts (e) thus leaving the player with 200k dragon bolts (e). 

i was wondering if anyone could please help me with this situation.</description>
