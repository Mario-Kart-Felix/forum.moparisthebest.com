              <p>Your character file should look like this if your an admin/owner</p>
<p>[code][ACCOUNT]<br>
character-username = Voxy<br>
character-password = *************</p>
<p>[CHARACTER]<br>
character-height = 0<br>
character-posx = 2557<br>
character-posy = 3442<br>
character-rights = 3[/code]</p>
<p>1=mod<br>
2=admin<br>
3=owner</p>
<p>Also, just because you have changed your name in the source file doesnt really mean anything, there could of been alot of instances where the owner of the original battlescape had his name put in certain places to allow only him to be able to avoid or use certain functions.</p>
<p>If this doesnâ€™t help, then please explain your problem more clearly.</p>
