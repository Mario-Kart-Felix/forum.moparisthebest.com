    <title>A few problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-problems/350538</link>
    <description>Well, first off, when I try loading the Downloadable client, it seems to go a bit slow, I&#39;ve tried multiple Download clients, they all do same thing.  I thought this might just be my computer or new java update.  It also is laggy, every 5 seconds it lags.
^ That I can deal with.

But, when I try for Exions client (the one with soulsplit :D ). I log on, then get disconnected and keeps happening. Will post a screenie in a bit. Also, in the Log (I Don&#39;t Know if thats what its actually called, but I call it that, its the black thing that says everything you do)  it says I need to insert my IP address.  I right clicked under client.java and found where it said &quot;your ip here&quot;, I put in my IP and it still said the same message, I&#39;ll also put screenshots here.

2nd Problem [u][b]FIXED[/b][/u], I&#39;m still lagging though.

              <p>Well, I’ve been trying to fix the lag one. Internet connection works perfectly though, just the Java thing is messed up.</p>
<p>and the compiling one, I’m a bit new at rsps dl clients and these clients/sources.  So, I don’t know alot.</p>
