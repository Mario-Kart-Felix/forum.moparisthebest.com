    <title>A few problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-problems/273318</link>
    <description>Hi.. I&#39;m having a few problems with my 508 Server.

- I need to Add Drops to NPC&#39;s (Currently Looking for a Tutorial)
- Banking - It seems the Banking area of the server has completely messed up..
- You can&#39;t withdraw Notes 
- Store - X doesn&#39;t work.
- Store - 0 (Related to Store X) doesn&#39;t work.

Will update if I find further problems.
If anyone can Help with any one of these problems, please send me a PM or post a reply. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Hmm I used to own a few 317 servers… But got bored of them.<br>
So I decided to create a new project (508 server) and so far It’s pretty much perfect except for those problems… - P.S. I found a few shops that work but… can’t find where to edit the shop. I’ll keep looking and thanks for the replys.</p>
