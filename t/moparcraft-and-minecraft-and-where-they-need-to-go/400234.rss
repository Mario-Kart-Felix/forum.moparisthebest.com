    <title>Moparcraft and Minecraft and where they need to go</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparcraft-and-minecraft-and-where-they-need-to-go/400234</link>
    <description>    Obviously resetting the map isn&#39;t a real solution to the problem and I think we can all agree on that. Enabling PvP certainly adds more factors to the game and more levels of difficulty. However it also enables some other not so wanted effects. And neither adding or disabling PvP is going to change griefing. 

    People seem to think making mobs harder wont be enough because of pr-existing structures and I don&#39;t really agree with that. Who&#39;s just going to log in and stay in the same structure for the rest of their virtual life. YOU HAVE to go out and collect resources, build more and explore. Its a fundamental part of the game. 

    However I&#39;m sure if a plugin can be made to change mob health, damage and frequency. Then surely you could modify the spawning conditions under which mobs appear making them even more difficult. Instead of rallying everyone against each other through PvP based activities rally them against something that has no human face. 

    The problem at hand is the game it&#39;s self just isn&#39;t currently difficult enough for most veteran gamers and it is sort of still in its infancy. The only real thing we can do is wait for more updates and hope that it address&#39;s the problem at it&#39;s core.

    As for stealing its my personal belief if you steal from someone its the same as griefing them. It adds up to the same exact thing as destroying their structure and adds potential emotional distress to lower age groups. It directly effects their buildings and the same goes for killing them. Another rule that doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be removed but [b]added[/b] is English only. This is a fairly major rule that isn&#39;t written anywhere on the rules list. Not only do I find the rule its self unfair. I also find not having the rule listed as unfair. It gives people who are foreign to English a possible expectation to being able to use their language freely. And a added effect of removing the rule is we could potentially gain more players.

    Everyone&#39;s pushing towards a closer community and to be honest I don&#39;t believe all of us living together is going to change anything besides make us fight more. Were in a world that can constantly expand to 8 times the surface area of the earth. This could easily be classified as a Super-Earth and there&#39;s no reason we shouldn&#39;t spread out. In-fact breaking up into smaller groups could make the game even more exciting then oppose to everyone living together in utopia.

I didn&#39;t post this in any other topic as it really ties everything together.



Edit: Even if your new to the server or forums or don&#39;t even participate in the sever I would still very much like to see your opinion. So please don&#39;t be afraid to share it.</description>

<p>So what about the Residence plugin as discussed in the other thread?  It seems like it might solve most of the problems people have.  (they could live close to each other as their rather small (64x64) area could be protected from greifing, they could also disable PvP in their area if they wish)</p>

<p>Sounds more like a property plugin, sounds cool.</p>

You could always add a rank where people have to get approved by a mod to build, destory, etc. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>

[/quote]Yeah and staff should get teleporting so they can go to the griefer when he’s busy to see if it’s no lie[/quote]+1, But the idea is the only way a person would be able to grief is when a mod is “online” to approve them, Now I guess when the staff logs out it would do any good if they are approved, But at least no random person can just grief and log <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Then you could always tell them to post on the forums before getting approved, Then forum activity ++ o.o</p>

<p>Not necessarily. It’s only because we don’t have a whitelist. You guys say it would decrease activity and I say why not? Then we can advertise the server for more mature players and add them to the server. It stops griefing and adds a better community. Not only that. We can keep pvp and add the plugin which can enable pvp free zones for people who just want to build. I feel it would be a win win decision.</p>

<p>Before we even had ANY plugins, I had my house burned down before.

<blockquote>I don't see the problem with spreading out. Staying together and living father apart both have their issues but in the long run I think everyone going their own separate way in smaller groups is for the better. Sure living closer together means other people can watch over others structures but it also means everything is closer together which makes it far more easier for the griefer. The problem with living farther apart is there's no one to watch over your structure besides you and your few closest friends to move with you. The upside is your structure is harder to find.</blockquote>

<p>Multiplayer nurtures the community spirit; people work together to build things, and unite in the face of griefers. It is the strong policing of these rooms, powered by a “patriotic” attachment to the game, (or one’s favorite server) that makes the game very hard for griefers. [/quote]</p>

<p>And obviously griefing has a big role in pushing players farther apart but its even more so with pvp and stealing being acceptable. All it does is breed more distrust and push people farther away in a game where people were already feeling pressured to move farther away and distrust each other due to griefing.</p>
