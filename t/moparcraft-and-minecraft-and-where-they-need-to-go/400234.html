        <pre><code>Obviously resetting the map isn't a real solution to the problem and I think we can all agree on that. Enabling PvP certainly adds more factors to the game and more levels of difficulty. However it also enables some other not so wanted effects. And neither adding or disabling PvP is going to change griefing. 

People seem to think making mobs harder wont be enough because of pr-existing structures and I don't really agree with that. Who's just going to log in and stay in the same structure for the rest of their virtual life. YOU HAVE to go out and collect resources, build more and explore. Its a fundamental part of the game. 

However I'm sure if a plugin can be made to change mob health, damage and frequency. Then surely you could modify the spawning conditions under which mobs appear making them even more difficult. Instead of rallying everyone against each other through PvP based activities rally them against something that has no human face. 

The problem at hand is the game it's self just isn't currently difficult enough for most veteran gamers and it is sort of still in its infancy. The only real thing we can do is wait for more updates and hope that it address's the problem at it's core.

As for stealing its my personal belief if you steal from someone its the same as griefing them. It adds up to the same exact thing as destroying their structure and adds potential emotional distress to lower age groups. It directly effects their buildings and the same goes for killing them. Another rule that doesn't necessarily need to be removed but [b]added[/b] is English only. This is a fairly major rule that isn't written anywhere on the rules list. Not only do I find the rule its self unfair. I also find not having the rule listed as unfair. It gives people who are foreign to English a possible expectation to being able to use their language freely. And a added effect of removing the rule is we could potentially gain more players.

Everyone's pushing towards a closer community and to be honest I don't believe all of us living together is going to change anything besides make us fight more. Were in a world that can constantly expand to 8 times the surface area of the earth. This could easily be classified as a Super-Earth and there's no reason we shouldn't spread out. In-fact breaking up into smaller groups could make the game even more exciting then oppose to everyone living together in utopia.

Removing these things makes the game both easy and unfair.[/quote]I don’t want to make mobs harmless I want to make them harder. The problem with ‘no major griefing’ is someone has to define the fine line between what is and isn’t griefing. Its the same as pvp rules. Minecraft isn’t suppose to be anything but what notch wants it to be.</p>
<p>Also on a more personal note towards you. Any mod would have made the same decision I did as it clearly broke the rules. So there’s no need for you to be immature and directly take your frustration out on me. I have nothing against you and I have personally apologized for mixing you up with your brother in the past. If you have a problem with the rules then welcome to my life and the purpose of this topic.</p>

The only rule Moparcraft should have is no major griefing. Other then that, I see no need for other rules. I personally believe that banning other users for stealing, raiding, or collecting resources from an abandoned house doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Minecraft is supposed to be a dog-eat-dog environment. Making mobs harmless is also stupid because they are designed to damage you for a reason. Removing these things makes the game both easy and unfair.<br>
[/quote]I don’t want to make mobs harmless I want to make them harder. The problem with ‘no major griefing’ is someone has to define the fine line between what is and isn’t griefing. Its the same as pvp rules. Minecraft isn’t suppose to be anything but what notch wants it to be.</p>
<p>Also on a more personal note towards you. Any mod would have made the same decision I did as it clearly broke the rules. So there’s no need for you to be immature and directly take your frustration out on me. I have nothing against you and I have personally apologized for mixing you up with your brother in the past. If you have a problem with the rules then welcome to my life and the purpose of this topic.[/quote]</p>
<p>I am not being immature, nor am I tanking out my anger on you. But the fact that I am banned for stealing crops doesn’t seem fair. I just offered to replant them, so what is the big deal?</p>

The big deal is you didn’t replant them and claimed you thought the city was abandoned, when you easily could have checked. Its like if I decided to steal from a store and then decided to give the item back. The rule has already been broken and I’m still going to get in trouble for it.</p>

You all just keep making it easier for griefers really, spreading everyone apart so that we can’t work together and see what’s really going on.[/quote]I don’t see the problem with spreading out. Staying together and living father apart both have their issues but in the long run I think everyone going their own separate way in smaller groups is for the better. Sure living closer together means other people can watch over others structures but it also means everything is closer together which makes it far more easier for the griefer. The problem with living farther apart is there’s no one to watch over your structure besides you and your few closest friends to move with you. The upside is your structure is harder to find.</p>
<p>And regardless you can’t make everyone live together anyway its largely unfair. Not too mention I know a few people who wouldn’t agree to do it, including myself.</p>

<p>And obviously griefing has a big role in pushing players farther apart but its even more so with pvp and stealing being acceptable. All it does is breed more distrust and push people farther away in a game where people were already feeling pressured to move farther away and distrust each other due to griefing.</p>

<blockquote>I don't see the problem with spreading out. Staying together and living father apart both have their issues but in the long run I think everyone going their own separate way in smaller groups is for the better. Sure living closer together means other people can watch over others structures but it also means everything is closer together which makes it far more easier for the griefer. The problem with living farther apart is there's no one to watch over your structure besides you and your few closest friends to move with you. The upside is your structure is harder to find.</blockquote>
<p>Even with everyone living together its not going to change anything.</p>

<p>Yes but if we didn’t have all these new issues we added to the game ourselves, people wouldn’t have to live far away… I remember when everyone lived close together, it was pretty awesome.</p>

<p>But in the end, it just causes fighting and splitting up. At its peak, UE had 15(?) people, but that lasted for a day. When it comes to big cities like that, new players just come in, get a couple of resources, and move out with their friends.</p>

<p>How about when you log in for the first time, you have the option for pvp to be yes or no. Then, you can change it throughout the game, but only every 24 hours.</p>

<p>If we unite in the face of griefers, how come people can’t build wood houses? Griefers are a pain to stop, do you know how easy it is for 1 person to make 5 accounts and endlessly rush your house? This game isn’t hard for griefers, just the opposite. Flint and steel is to easy to make. I think Notch needs to add a minecraft ‘free trial’ kinda thing, where you can play freely anywhere for 14 days, and make cracked clients completely unusable, even with ‘offline mode’ turned on.</p>
