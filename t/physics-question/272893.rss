    <description>A truck of 15 tonnes is driving down a hill at an angle of 45 degrees from the horizontal with a velocity 25m s[sup]-1[/sup]. After 100m the driver realises his brakes do not work and frantically tries to apply the brakes. The driver may also be considered blond. He free rolls down the hill for another 100m until he reaches a gravel bed.

The cab and trailer each have 4 wheels of radius 50cm and tire thickness 20cm. As the truck hits the gravel bed 5cm of gravel covers each of the wheels. Each pebble provides 10N of braking force, and each pebble exerting a force on any wheel has 1x10[sup]-4[/sup]m[sup]2[/sup] of surface area in contact.

Calculate the distance traveled from the point the driver attempts to brake until the truck retards to a halt.

I got 1.12km but that seems a bit big... What did everyone else get?</description>

              <p>Wow thanks a lot for that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I had most trouble with finding the surface area of the wheels. First time I made up my own formula (lol) and calculated the arc circumference by using c=pi.d (3.1416 * 1m = 3.1416m) and them multiplied by the ratio of wheel exposed (0.05 / 1 = 0.05). This give a circumference of 0.05 * 3.1416 = 0.157m.</p>
<p>Then I multiplied by thickness (0.2) and got 0.03m^2 and then halved it because only half each wheel is providing frictional contact. Then multiplied by 8 for each wheel to get 0.25m^2 in contact with all the wheels.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t the right way to do it but we’ve never done mathematical rules any more complicated than this so I just considered my method to be sufficient for AS level physics. I tried to follow your method through using metres and didn’t get what you got - had 0.18m^2 which is relatively close the the value I got with my crappy method.</p>
<p>I did all the rest of the calculation fine (easy bit :P) and using the right value for the pebbles in contact with the truck come to the same answer as you. I also nearly passed out in the middle of that so I’m not going through anything like it again.</p>
<p>I suppose we’re being asked to calculate distance, not displacement. I was going to explain what I did but it’s burning my head again so I might come back later and edit my post…</p>
<p>Thanks again for all the help</p>

              <p>I originally had 58.3 m/s but then I reconsidered and realised that the acceleration due to gravity is going to be equal to the deceleration of friction. So I assumed the velocity would be the same.</p>
<p>Are you suppose to be ignoring friction for the road? If so then the velocity is 58.3 m/s when it hits the gravel bed but, How did you work out the displacement using energy?</p>
<p><img src="http://www.gogeometry.com/circle/sagitta_chord_arc.gif" alt width="372" height="242"><br>
The sagitta of the part of the wheel consumed by pebbles is 5 centimetres, Using the sagitta formulas,<br>
<img src="http://mathtran.org/cgi-bin/mathtran?D=1;tex=s%20%3D%20r%20-%20%5Csqrt%7Br%5E2%20-%20l%5E2%7D" alt width="" height=""><br>
Where l is the length from A to D or D to B<br>
Basing off <img src="http://liutaiomottola.com/formulae/sag_files/image002.gif" alt width="385" height="230"><br>
We can work out l using:<br>
<img src="http://mathtran.org/cgi-bin/mathtran?D=1;tex=l%3D%5Csqrt%7B-(r-s)%5E2%2Br%5E2%7D" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>And then according to the image, l is half of the chord so double it and use that length and the cosine rule to find the angle of the arc.<br>
<img src="http://mathtran.org/cgi-bin/mathtran?D=1;tex=%5Ctheta%20%3D%20%5Ccos%5E-1(%7B%5Cfrac%7B50%5E2%20%2B%2050%5E2-43.6%5E2%7D%7B2*50*50%7D%7D)" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Then we use the Arc Length formula<br>
<img src="http://mathtran.org/cgi-bin/mathtran?D=1;tex=c%20%3D%202*50*%5Cpi*%5Cfrac%7B51.6838655263343%7D%7B360%7D" alt width="" height=""><br>
Which means that 41.1 centimetres of the circumference of the tyre is engulfed by pebbles, then because it’s 3D times it by the depth, 20 cm to get 822, BUT only one half of these will be infront of the tyre, meaning only half will be applying a force against the truck. so divide this by two and you get 411 cm^2</p>
<p>Ah I see where I went wrong now, I didn’t convert my units.</p>
<p>Then if the pebble is 0.0001 m^2 that means it’s 1 square centimetre so…411 pebbles are contacting each tyre. Remember there are 8 tyres so that means there are actually 3288 pebbles against the entire car.</p>
<p>All of these pebbles providing a frictional(I call it frictional because it’s retarding the truck) force of 32888 N, which divided by 15000kg gives us the deceleration of 2.192 m/s/s.</p>
<p>Which when used with v^2 = u^2 + 2as<br>
We get a total displacement for the pebbles as 142.56 metres.<br>
(Keep in mind deceleration is negative acceleration)</p>
<p>So all in all, it took the truck 342.56 metres to stop.</p>
<p>I used 25 m/s as the velocity for the truck because at 45 degrees the frictional deceleration will equal the gravitational acceleration assumed mu of one, If not then yes, use 58.3 m/s which gives a TOTAL(not just pebble) stopping distance of 974.830880987971 metres</p>
<p>In a single formula:<br>
3<em>25^2/(16</em>(pi arcCos(31/50)/180)) = 130m + 200 = 330m which is distance from 25m/s</p>

              <p>My workings a bit crazy and did it a while ago but I think its telling me there are 500 pebbles in contact with all the wheels, that what you got?</p>
<p>The friction of the road can also be considered zezo. I worked out the velocity using energy equations (E=mgh and E[sub]k[/sub]=1/2mv^2) because the question was in the energy section. What velocity did you get before it hit the gravel bed? I got 58.3 m/s.</p>
<p>I’ll try do it again tomorrow I’m about to go, my working is horrible.</p>

<p>How do you work out the circumference of a chord? To get the number of pebbles touching the wheels I used:<br>
((8 * 5 * pi * 20 / 2)/(1*10^-4)) * 10 And I used that as my frictional force when working out the deceleration of the truck in the pebbles</p>
