Everest. After several long weeks of the worse weather conditions in the world Ruby finally caught sight of the tip and decided that today was his day. He summoned all the energy left in his ravished body to make it to the top. Approaching his destination he saw a figure emerging. Ruby was lost in confusion and curiosity lead him to the finish. As he approached the figure he shouted “HEY!” but there was no reply, the figure never even moved. Ruby continued shouting until he finally reached the figure, breathing deeply and out of breath Ruby whispered “Hello.” The figure replied telling him the great job he did and wondered if he was interested in training MMA. Ruby didn’t know what to do, in shock he told the figure “sure”. The figure then told Ruby that he must first survive for several days at the peak of the mountain without eating and suddenly the figure vanished. Just like that! Ruby was shocked, not knowing what to do and interested in MMA… Ruby patiently waited and waited and waited. Several hours passed and Ruby had a train of though that he had died and he must be in heaven. A day passed, then two days and Ruby was starving. Laying on the ground Ruby was beginning to lose interest. He gathered his belongings and decided to head back down the mountain. As he was about to take his first step he heard a voice in the wind telling him that his rs account just got banned by Jagex. Knowing that he had nothing to return to he pushed through and patiently waited. The final day came along and the figure reappeared. Ruby and the figure began training and trained for 30 days without a single bite of food. Since his Mt. Everest Expedition, Ruby has been national champion several times now and Mr. Europe twice. Now gtfo this thread before I summon Rubys epic Falcon Punch with a strength level of 9001.[/quote]Then one day Ruby was training with “The Great One” when PizzaHut came by with a delivery. The delivery boy said, “Hello, sir. I have this meatlovers pizza with extra ham with an order to this address. Please sign here and have a nice day.” So in a rush of speed and hunger Ruby signed his name and watched the delivery boy turn into Sha-Kun the feared Ninja Master of the Eastern Shore. Ruby was then teleported away to the Eastern Shore. After a week of torture and still not giving up Sha-kun knew he was going to have to try a different method. Sha-Kun decided to take Ruby under his wings and teach him the magical arts of Moderation. This training would be gruesome and require himt o venture into depths that he never dreamed of!</p>

        <p>UFC has it’s downsides i’m sure, so does boxing, but doesn’t all come down to the fighter, if someone gets a cramp or not, energy levels, etc, in a fight anything could happened, just like any other moment, you wouldn’t have roy jones vs Anderson silva would you? or Muhammad ali vs GPS, I was thinking, Boxers like roy jones probably can keep a greater amount of strength and mass while cutting, after all they aren’t constantly training, slamming people, doing endurance, cardio, cutting, bulking up, (resting), if your fast-paced you gotta be well conditioned and as a result they probably got a greater chance of injury/strain/overtraining, but it all comes down to the actual fighter, the fight, input, output, etc</p>

        <p>One of the major downsides to UFC is nationality favoritism, especially in Canada. If you put a Canadian fighter against another nationality fighter, if it goes to decision the judges will almost always pick the Canadian. Especially with fighters like Nick Ring, where Court McGee clearly dominated him for the last two rounds but couldn’t finish him and Canadian judges gave Ring an undeserving win.</p>
<p>Not to mention the refs which are garbage (not including Dean). Most of them pick the fighters up as one fighter is  getting into position, or even end matches without a fighter tapping out. UFC has a long way to go staff wise before they can be considered a legitimate sport.</p>
