    <description>If you want a down to earth group of people that want to have fun then this is the server for you. We do not believe in server abuse and make it our responsibility to have everyone play on the same level. No items will be spawned and PvP rules are in place to make sure strong factions cannot push their weight around on the smaller ones. We are looking for mature and talented builders to grow our community. If you enjoy RPG elements in minecraft we have mcmmo and runecraft to fill your needs.
