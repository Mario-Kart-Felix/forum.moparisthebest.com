    <title>Game Storyline</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-storyline/293331</link>
    <description>Hello MoparScape, i&#39;m currently programming a Computer Game, and need some ideas. Right now i&#39;m writing the storyline of how the game is played, and what it&#39;s about, but I need some ideas.

I&#39;ll give what I have so far:


There is an Ancient King in the land of [b]Miscellatamea, Englasia[/b]. The king&#39;s son, [b]Ezekiel[/b] was jealous of his father because his father has more control, and power than him. He wanted to sit on the throne highest of all, a throne apon the sky of his father, a throne that none other can reach but him. His father, [b]Rarru[/b], didn&#39;t approve of his wantings. Ezekiel didn&#39;t like to obey the laws, as he thought he was a King. Ezekiel then went after his father and tried striking at him. Ezekiel took [b]The legendary blade of Evil&#39;s Bane, the Eternal &amp; Nocturnal Darkness Destorying Sword[/b]. The sword was meant for destorying evil, and Rarru was nothing as such. Once he hit Rarru with it, the power of Rarru reflected against the Sword, causing it to hit back at Ezekiel. Since the sword was created for destorying evil, Ezekiel then became weakened. With little thought, he casted a curse apon the town of Miscellatamea, and then left to the Sacred realm of Etceteria, with Miscellatamea.




Any ideas? This is how the game starts.</description>

What language are you making this game with?<br>
[/quote[quote=“n33bz0rpl0x, post:18, topic:293331”]So let me guess, you’re creating a game storyline that steals a region in runescape, and a town, cool, and i guess the sword of   “destorying” Destroys too, right?[/quote]</p>
<p>No, i’m not taking regions of RuneScape out. Noob.</p>

Lol…Long ago, when God was creating Earth, he created an Angel, named <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Satan Lucifer</span></span>. Satan became jealous of God because God was more powerful. Satan gathered up some Angels, and created his own Kingdom called Hell, and became his own God.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Now I’m pretty sure that Satan is the devil and Lucifer was one of God’s Archangels. Besides…this whole plot sounds too much like Zelda. Sacred realm and the name Rarru (Raru is a sage in OoT) are just too closely related, more so the sword of evil’s bane (Master Sword in just about every Zelda game).[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, I took some names from Zelda into my game, but it isn’t like zelda. There are some stuff that is like zelda, but it isn’t really Zelda.</p>

Lol…Long ago, when God was creating Earth, he created an Angel, named <span class="bbcode-b">Satan Lucifer</span>. Satan became jealous of God because God was more powerful. Satan gathered up some Angels, and created his own Kingdom called Hell, and became his own God.<br>

<p>Hmm. how is this “game” going to look show some pics?, maybe that would make the story line more interesting atm. i would use that game as an insult.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m still making the character models, and the game isn’t completed complete. Right now i’m working on the Story of the game, how it’s played, everything people say, etc…</p>

              <p>Hello MoparScape, i’m currently programming a Computer Game, and need some ideas. Right now i’m writing the storyline of how the game is played, and what it’s about, but I need some ideas.</p>
<p>I’ll give what I have so far:</p>
<p>There is an Ancient King in the land of <span class="bbcode-b">Miscellatamea, Englasia</span>. The king’s son, <span class="bbcode-b">Ezekiel</span> was jealous of his father because his father has more control, and power than him. He wanted to sit on the throne highest of all, a throne apon the sky of his father, a throne that none other can reach but him. His father, <span class="bbcode-b">Rarru</span>, didn’t approve of his wantings. Ezekiel didn’t like to obey the laws, as he thought he was a King. Ezekiel then went after his father and tried striking at him. Ezekiel took <span class="bbcode-b">The legendary blade of Evil’s Bane, the Eternal &amp; Nocturnal Darkness Destorying Sword</span>. The sword was meant for destorying evil, and Rarru was nothing as such. Once he hit Rarru with it, the power of Rarru reflected against the Sword, causing it to hit back at Ezekiel. Since the sword was created for destorying evil, Ezekiel then became weakened. With little thought, he casted a curse apon the town of Miscellatamea, and then left to the Sacred realm of Etceteria, with Miscellatamea.</p>
<p>Any ideas? This is how the game starts.</p>
