    <description>No idea why a mod deleted my other post :S.
But anyways my lunars is messed up, originally it crashed when you tried to put lunars on. Managed to make it stop, now it opens up the interface but shows nothing. I have everything correctly placed in the rsinterface etc.. I have spent no word of a lie a good 5+ hours trying to fix this, I keep going round in circles. I managed to once get the interface up and then it&#39;d crash when I hovered over it. I progressed further and it didn&#39;t crash but then veng wouldn&#39;t work so I completely removed it and put it in again and I&#39;m back to square 2.

Also, not to sure why but I can only change spellbook once per login, so everytime i login/out i can repeat. 

I don&#39;t feel the need to post the code because the codes fine, it works for other people and I get no errors.. but if you feel that i need to post the code feel free to say so.
