    <title>I need a timer for woodcutting!</title>

    <description>I am in need of a timer for 4 seconds!
I am using Wolf&#39;s Project16 and woodcutting dosn&#39;t work... or any other objects that need clicking on
So i made a code for when you click on the tree.

if(objectID == 1276) { //Click on a tree

if (IsItemInBag(1351) == true || IsItemInBag(1349) == true || IsItemInBag(1353) == true || IsItemInBag(1355) == true || IsItemInBag(1357) == true || IsItemInBag(1359) == true || IsItemInBag(6739) == true || (playerEquipment[3] == 1351) || (playerEquipment[3] == 1349) || (playerEquipment[3] == 1353) || (playerEquipment[3] == 1355) || (playerEquipment[3] == 1357) || (playerEquipment[3] == 1359) || (playerEquipment[3] == 6739)) {

setAnimation(0x284);
resetAnimation();
sendMessage(&quot;You get some logs.&quot;);
addSkillXP(75, playerWoodcutting);
addItem(2511,1);
} else {
sendMessage(&quot;You dont have an axe!&quot;);
} }

When you click on the tree, it does the cutting animation and gives you xp and logs.
It detects if your axe is in your hand or bag.

It works really well, now i just have to get it so that you have to wait to get the logs.

Please help me! Thanks!</description>
