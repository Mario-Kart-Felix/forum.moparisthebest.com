    <title>Stupid Freaking School *Warning - Arham Mad*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stupid-freaking-school-warning-arham-mad/437920</link>
    <description>So, what my friend did was he messaged the girl that told all the girls about sex, and told them:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I don&#39;t care about your sex shit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later, he got carried away and started saying real bad stuff (Idk, just someone told me started saying bad stuff). Then the school found out that he messaged it (idk how, did they get in the email?) and they punished 2 people. 1 girl and 1 boy (boy = friend, idk why the girl was suspended). 

Seriously, sounds lame lol... 6 days for something like that is just lame. And he&#39;s actually trying to stop them for being embarrassed in life. 

I hate my school for this.
Seriously.

But I still am wondering...

[b]Why the hell would the school care about something outside of school?[/b]</description>
