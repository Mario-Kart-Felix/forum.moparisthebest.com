<p>Proof.<br>
Until then, no.<br>
[/quote]Wise words my friend. There’s no proof about God, only a Bible which proves nothing.</p>

</aside>
<p>“But if there was proof, there would be no faith”, says the religious. I personally don’t believe in any god.[/quote]<br>
Ironic, I could <span class="bbcode-i">never</span> have “faith” without proof.</p>
<p>Religion is pointless, any “loving” god would not wish to be worshiped, and would not punish those who choose to live their lives under their own will. And as such, it is little more than greed. I would hate to be condemned to a reality in which the Christian god exists.</p>
<p>Personally I believe there is some form of higher power which “created” the universe, it’s just too complex to be created spontaneously. Perhaps this higher power is something far beyond what you could comprehend through our own reality, so the word “entity” (implied by “God”) is irrelevant.</p>
<p>And honestly, why post a thread such as this with no discussion involved? “Yes” or “no” doesn’t mean anything.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:35, topic:145018”]I believe in God, that there is a higher power out there that created all that is and is active in our world today.  I don’t see how one could look at the world and not come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>I also am a few years older than most of you, and in that time I have discovered that at the ages most of you are at now, you tend to say you are ‘athiest, agnostic’ or just don’t believe in God to rebel against your parents, and/or convention.  When you get a few more years on you the vast majority will grow out of that stage.  Of course this doesn’t apply to everyone, but it has happened to a vast majority of my friends and acquaintances when growing up, and will undoubtedly happen to you as well. ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>The idea that religion is considered ‘convention’ really saddens me. You make a relatively interesting point though, you seem to infer that parents should have an influence on their child’s belief - I do not agree with that, children should be allowed to make their decision without any influence. Religion scares people into joining and staying, the idea of Hell/Karma scares children/teenagers/adults into adhering even though they see major holes in their beliefs. Children and teenagers also seem to become little minions of their parents simply because they were raised in a religious enviroment.</p>

<p>Why would a God who is omniscient and benevolent create a world, where he knew we would sin. Why would he create this world if he knew that we would sin, and thus, go to Hell? A God with true love would do everything to stop suffering even beginning. A God who is truly omniscient or benevolent would never of created the world.</p>

I believe in God, that there is a higher power out there that created all that is and is active in our world today.  I don’t see how one could look at the world and not come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>I also am a few years older than most of you, and in that time I have discovered that at the ages most of you are at now, you tend to say you are ‘athiest, agnostic’ or just don’t believe in God to rebel against your parents, and/or convention.  When you get a few more years on you the vast majority will grow out of that stage.  Of course this doesn’t apply to everyone, but it has happened to a vast majority of my friends and acquaintances when growing up, and will undoubtedly happen to you as well. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

<p>The idea that religion is considered ‘convention’ really saddens me. You make a relatively interesting point though, you seem to infer that parents should have an influence on their child’s belief - I do not agree with that, children should be allowed to make their decision without any influence. Religion scares people into joining and staying, the idea of Hell/Karma scares children/teenagers/adults into adhering even though they see major holes in their beliefs. Children and teenagers also seem to become little minions of their parents simply because they were raised in a religious enviroment.[/quote]</p>

<p>Even though the idea may sadden you, religion is generally ‘convention’ since the vast majority of people around the world have some type of religion and believe in a ‘higher power’.  Is is coincidence that thousands of different cultures from all around the world, most of which developed in isolation from each other, all believe in a higher power?  Is it an even bigger coincidence that many of their believes coincide with each other?  I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Parents obviously have an influence over their children’s beliefs, that is the job description of a parent.  Children should be allowed to make decisions without any influence or guidance? So if a child believed that drinking bleach would not hurt them, parents should not get involved?  Children are free to make their own decisions when they are of age, hence the basis for my argument.</p>
<p>Children get older to the point where they are capable of making their own decisions, and for one reason or the other feel the need to rebel against the system.  Later in life they make a decision on how they truly feel and follow their own hearts.  In my experience this is generally how it happens.  I can count at least 20 people I know that this exact series of events has happened to that I know personally as good friends.</p>

My mum (Who I live with) didn’t influence me, she said “Believe what you want to believe in” She’s a atheist, but if you are, what can you do to scare them into being atheist? Nothing so your statement is not true most of the time <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Also, about “God” creating the earth, I don’t think that’s true, I believe that a big bang created the earth, but, I guess when the bible was written, god wouldn’t be called a big bang <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Also, I was wondering how you could believe some higher being created you and you’re family? Are you basing this of how your perants created you?</p>

<p>Religions as a whole generally exist to provide an explanation of how life began. Humans always try to find explanations when things are unknown - it is human nature. Most major religions are quite simply outdated, they are no longer valid by what we <span class="bbcode-i">scientifically</span> know(<span class="bbcode-i">I’m proberly going to get burnt for that.</span>). I’m not sure I see too many religions that coincide with each other, the only major ones that I know of are the Abrahamic religions, but, even these have major differences. The fact that most religions believe in a “higher-power” is easily explained, given the understanding of the world at the time of most religions “founding”(anywhere from pre BCE to 1600CE), the Sun could of quite easily been seen as “God”, and, infact it was treated as such by some religions - it is easy to see how these “people who talked to God” may of been confused.</p>
<p>I should of probably said “you seem to infer that parents should have an influence on their child’s <span class="bbcode-b">religious</span> belief”. Parents who force a religion on children is wrong in every possible way, children get fed one side of the “story” and that’s what they grow up believing, they won’t except anything else, or even think about other ideas.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, from your original post you said that the “vast majority will grow out of that stage”, you seem to think that most atheists only choose to be atheists to rebel, while this may be true for very few people, it does not apply to most. Generalisations are bad <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>…, I believe that a big bang created the earth, but, I guess when the bible was written, god wouldn’t be called a big bang <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>No, the big bang did not create earth. The big bang supposedly created all matter in the universe, and the earth was created by gases compressing under their own gravity.</p>

<p>everyone should know jesus was real. because he was. just stories about his are fake, like him rising from the dead and what not.[/quote]<br>
No, Jesus <span class="bbcode-i">is</span> just a theory. Whether this theory is true or false can be debated, how can anyone <span class="bbcode-i">know</span> he was real? How do you know his existence is isn’t just part of another story which is fake?</p>

<p>I voted as “not sure” because, if god created every, who created god(or what)? And how did that thing come to be, when these things are answered I will believe in god.</p>

<p>Let’s say for a minute the Christian God does exist. It is physically impossible for this God to exist in our own reality, so he/it more than likely exists in another “dimension”. Look at it from a quantum physics standpoint, he/it could exist in, for the sake of the discussion, the 6th dimension. He/it could be looking down on the 3rd dimension and see all sides of all objects, quite similarly to how us in the 3rd dimension would look down at a sheet of paper (2 dimensional) and see all sides of the objects respectively.</p>
