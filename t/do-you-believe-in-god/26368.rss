              <p>[quote=“leader, post:16, topic:26368”]I don’t really believe in God. I used to go to church every sunday, but haven’t since I came from England. I’m just curious as to how God came to be. This mean that I am agnostic, because I am trying to figure out how God came to be. How would we know if there is a God or not? Just because someone says there is a God, it doesn’t mean there is. We weren’t there when he, God, had supposedly created the universe. The greeks believed in many gods, why do we believe in only one? I’m not trying to hurt anyone, or make anyone atheist.</p>
<p>Any of you believe in the Big Bang Theory? Science is always changing so we don’t know if that is true.[/quote]<br>
im thinking the exact same as you…</p>

              <p>I kind of agree with you now :P, maby there is a superior life form wich created earth and stuff, but I still dont believe that he, or in this theory them, help you when you pray. And that part is the part I fully disbelieve. Really, there is no god that helps you when you pray for it or when you are in danger and need help. Always when you see christians that got out of a dangerous situation, they say god helped them. That makes me laugh because its imposible.</p>

But then you would have an endless amount of universes, because they had to be created too, and their creators aswell. So there is no real explanation on how it was created, and I dont think it will ever be discovered. Unless we find other forms of life on other planets, and somehow communicate or experiment with them and discover it that way.</p>

<p>Some interesting facts for you…</p>
<p>[ul][li]Our solar system is only 1 star in a single globular star cluster, which typically contain thousands of stars.[/li]<br>
[li]The Milky Way galaxy is estimated to contain several hundred star clusters, not including the galactic halo and nucleus.[/li]<br>
[li]Our Milky Way galaxy is a part of a poor galaxy cluster, containing about 15-25 other galaxies.[/li]<br>
[li]It is estimated that 100 billion galaxies would be <span class="bbcode-b">visible</span> with our current technology were it not for the dust clouds of the Milky Way that surround us.  That doesn’t include the galaxies that are too distant to see.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I don’t believe that God went and just placed life on only certain planets, but I do believe that there is life elsewhere and that God had a part to play in the creation of the universe.  As I mentioned in a previous post in this thread, God does not necessarily have to be some supreme and powerful spirit force.  What if there is a higher level of life unknown to us who, just as we experiment with such tools as particle accelerators, created the universe as an experiment?  God is the abstract representation of a higher power, and from there people believe what they want to.</p>

It can be any god, but because I live in a christian country explain to me why the christian god exists.<br>

However, if you take a look at the world around us, could you really believe that everything we know is a result of pure randomness?  It was mere chance that Earth was formed at such a perfect distance to harbor life?  The perfect combination of elements on Earth that sprang evolution and life was just random?  I’m not saying Earth is special in any way, as I am sure there are other such worlds out there, but I personally don’t see how everything we know was a result of chance.  For that reason, I believe in God.  That may or may not convince you, but I at least, I don’t know about anyone else, am not trying to convince anyone.  As I mentioned before, belief in God is quite a personal idea, and I don’t think anyone should try and force people to change their views.[/quote]</p>
<p>I respect people who believe in any god, but i lose my respect when they do abnormal things. But why should ‘god’ make thousands of planets, and only let a few be populated. I say a few because I also believe that whe dont live on the only planet with live, I agree with you on that point. So say that there are a 100 planets that contain any form of live, and there are millions of planets (because there are many galaxys, I just made that number up lol). That is a bad ratio. I cant explain how the universe existed, but a ‘god’ cant have created it, because how the hell would he do that? First, ‘god’ had to be born from anything, so he couldnt be the creator. Second, if in any magical way he did exist, where did he had to start? Look around, everything starts with something else, like Scar started with Delphi(?), Delphi started with Pascal, Pascal started with something else, and it all started with the invention of a computer. But that computer was ‘started’ with other technical things. At least thats my theory. That way I think mankind started with monkey-alike creatures, then evolved in cave men and eventually became humans like we are now.</p>
<p>Note: I DONT disrespect anyone that believes anything.</p>

<p>people who don’t believe in him think they have everything mapped about the universe.</p>
<p>Talked to this one guy im not going to say who but he posted a full theory about how god doesn’t exist.<br>
How it all started from black plasma and some shit I didn’t really read everything he wrote he types a full book in 5 minutes good coder though :D. After he finished typing I read the first thing about light or something and asked him how did that begin he paused a while and started bullshitting. So ya even if you think you know how it all started there is always a question how did that thing begin.</p>
<p>god exists!<br>

There’s no need to flame man…even if his post wasn’t exactly articulate, he did bring up a good point…no one does know how the universe started…even the Big Bang theory cannot explain for any events prior to about 1 trillionth of a second (which really would explain how everything started…where the original gamma rays came from).</p>

<p>Well in Sikhism we believe in one creator, but don’t believe that every religion has its own separate God.  A religion is simply allows for a different perspective of the unknown.  Anyway, you’re statement asking us to convince you of God will never work.  Faith in God is personal, and people don’t believe because of logical or proven evidence.  So in that sense, you cannot prove that God exists.</p>

<p>I garuntee I know more about your religion than you do. I bet you came to this thread trying to defend your religious figure, yet you’ve done NOTHING to prove that God’s followers are any different from Satanists besides they’re religous activities. I believe in Wicca because magyk is real, and I garuntee that you have used, seen, or participated in it without even knowing it. You know those little horoscopes you look at on <a href="http://www.astrology.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.astrology.com/</a>? That’s an astrological form of Divination(seeing into the future) and is a form of Magyk. Just another uneducated Christian, you give a bad name to your religion.</p>

<p>Talked to this one guy im not going to say who but he posted a full theory about how god doesn’t exist.<br>
How it all started from black plasma and some shit I didn’t really read everything he wrote he types a full book in 5 minutes good coder though :D. After he finished typing I read the first thing about light or something and asked him how did that begin he paused a while and started bullshitting. So ya even if you think you know how it all started there is always a question how did that thing begin.</p>
<p>god exists!</p>

<p>God is real, but not really. He is not a man, he’s a man. Just like a woman. The bible is fake, Moses just wrote down words he heard from a burning bush, which happens all the time. When God said let there be light, all he did was flip on the light switch.</p>
<p>I hope I cleared that up for everybody.</p>
