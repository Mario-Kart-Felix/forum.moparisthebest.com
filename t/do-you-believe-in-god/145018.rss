No, your grammar is wrong. “hes mentioned a bunch of times in books and records from then”?<br>
You’re stating hes mentioned something in books and records, then moronically curving your statement into a question, and then asking “from”?</p>
<p>Again, restate your post, this time intelligently.</p>

<p>Eh yeah, what are you even trying to say? I never said Jesus <span class="bbcode-i">doesnt</span> exist, but honestly what proof does anyone have? Jesus could be a character made up by someone which reflected their own views, or he very well could have existed. The point is theres no way to prove either side of the <span class="bbcode-b">theory</span>.</p>

<p>Let’s say for a minute the Christian God does exist. It is physically impossible for this God to exist in our own reality, so he/it more than likely exists in another “dimension”. Look at it from a quantum physics standpoint, he/it could exist in, for the sake of the discussion, the 6th dimension. He/it could be looking down on the 3rd dimension and see all sides of all objects, quite similarly to how us in the 3rd dimension would look down at a sheet of paper (2 dimensional) and see all sides of the objects respectively.</p>

</aside>
<p>The idea that religion is considered ‘convention’ really saddens me. You make a relatively interesting point though, you seem to infer that parents should have an influence on their child’s belief - I do not agree with that, children should be allowed to make their decision without any influence. Religion scares people into joining and staying, the idea of Hell/Karma scares children/teenagers/adults into adhering even though they see major holes in their beliefs. Children and teenagers also seem to become little minions of their parents simply because they were raised in a religious enviroment.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>[offtopic]I always look forward to juju’s responses to my posts, because he always contradicts me, and he is so articulate with his arguments. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> [/offtopic]</p>
<p>Even though the idea may sadden you, religion is generally ‘convention’ since the vast majority of people around the world have some type of religion and believe in a ‘higher power’.  Is is coincidence that thousands of different cultures from all around the world, most of which developed in isolation from each other, all believe in a higher power?  Is it an even bigger coincidence that many of their believes coincide with each other?  I don’t think so.</p>
<p>Parents obviously have an influence over their children’s beliefs, that is the job description of a parent.  Children should be allowed to make decisions without any influence or guidance? So if a child believed that drinking bleach would not hurt them, parents should not get involved?  Children are free to make their own decisions when they are of age, hence the basis for my argument.</p>
<p>Children get older to the point where they are capable of making their own decisions, and for one reason or the other feel the need to rebel against the system.  Later in life they make a decision on how they truly feel and follow their own hearts.  In my experience this is generally how it happens.  I can count at least 20 people I know that this exact series of events has happened to that I know personally as good friends.[/quote]</p>
<p>Religions as a whole generally exist to provide an explanation of how life began. Humans always try to find explanations when things are unknown - it is human nature. Most major religions are quite simply outdated, they are no longer valid by what we <span class="bbcode-i">scientifically</span> know(<span class="bbcode-i">I’m proberly going to get burnt for that.</span>). I’m not sure I see too many religions that coincide with each other, the only major ones that I know of are the Abrahamic religions, but, even these have major differences. The fact that most religions believe in a “higher-power” is easily explained, given the understanding of the world at the time of most religions “founding”(anywhere from pre BCE to 1600CE), the Sun could of quite easily been seen as “God”, and, infact it was treated as such by some religions - it is easy to see how these “people who talked to God” may of been confused.</p>
<p>I should of probably said “you seem to infer that parents should have an influence on their child’s <span class="bbcode-b">religious</span> belief”. Parents who force a religion on children is wrong in every possible way, children get fed one side of the “story” and that’s what they grow up believing, they won’t except anything else, or even think about other ideas.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, from your original post you said that the “vast majority will grow out of that stage”, you seem to think that most atheists only choose to be atheists to rebel, while this may be true for very few people, it does not apply to most. Generalisations are bad <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
