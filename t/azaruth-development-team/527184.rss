    <description>[center][img]http://azaruth.com/images/logo.png[/img][/center]

Azaruth, formally known as DeathzScape has existed since 2009. I&#39;ve always developed alone but I&#39;ve come to the realization that all the ideas I want to implement will take ages working solo so it is time for me to recruit a development team for Azaruth.

Azaruth already exists as a decent server so the current goal list is short but here it is anyway:
[b]Goals:[/b]

[ul][li][b]Main goal:[/b] Integrate the server and website on a level never seen in RSPS before[/li]
[li]Push the server further away from its RuneScape roots with the implementation of unique features[/li]
[li]Establish a community with the highest possible user-friendly experience[/li]
[li]... More goals will be established when a team starts to form.[/li][/ul]


[b]Development Log:[/b]
[code]Accomplishments before establishing a team:
-Server-
* Two linked worlds with different economies
* Thorough logging system to monitor server and player activity
* Custom skill in the making
* ... A relatively enjoyable server with many features, most development will be in the client and website

-Client-
* 317 refractored client with fullscreen support and multiple gameframes
* Communication with website to download and update cache
* Loading much higher revision animations, graphics, items, etc

-Website-
* Fresh installation of WordPress and Pageline&#39;s DMS
* Databases cleared and ready to be reworked
* Free to use either PHP 4 or 5
* Domain name has long since been purchased
* Website is optimized by CloudFlare[/code]

[b]Current openings and desired prerequisites:[/b]

[ul][li]Web developer[list]
[li]Must be familiar with WordPress and Pagelines DMS[/li]
[li]Extensive knowledge of PHP[/li]
[li]Willingness to work closely with myself to implement server -&gt; website communications[/li]
[/list][/li]
[li]Client developer[list]
[li]Must be familiar with refractored 317 client[/li]
[li]Extensive knowledge of Java[/li]
[li]Animation experience is a bonus[/li]
[li]Troubleshooting flawed code is a strong bonus[/li]
[/list][/li]
[li][s]Animation/Modeler/Graphical designer[/s][list]
[li][s]Must have experience with 3D modeling and or 2D drawing[/s][/li]
[li][s]Is familiar with the 317 client to assist the Client Developer in implementing new models/graphical work[/s][/li]
[li][s]Animation experience is a strong bonus[/s][/li]
[/list][/li][/ul]


I&#39;ll keep the application simple
[code]
[b]Preferred name:[/b]
[b]Position wanted:[/b]
[b]Amount of time that can be dedicated to development weekly:[/b]
[b]List relevant skills that make you qualified for aforementioned position:[/b]

              <p>I wish I had the time, I really do. Azaruth has the chance to go somewhere, really. The most I can offer in the way of help is helping you pick a good enough website developer, if you have anyone you’re not sure about then I’ll be on Skype. I’d like to offer more than just that but at this minute in time I’m pretty busy, I could be free in the near future depending on where the current project I’m with goes (it could go either way right now) so I’ll definitely keep in touch.</p>
