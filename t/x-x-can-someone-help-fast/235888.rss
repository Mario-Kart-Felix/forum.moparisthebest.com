    <description>Geeeeeeeez I don&#39;t seem to get much help when I post this so here is one more detailed!!!! Ok Now hereee we go

[b]BOLD LETTERS ARE A MUST FIX BEFORE I RELEASE MY SERVER[/b]

RED LETTERS ARE A HIGHLY NEED BUT SERVER CAN BE RELEASED WITHOUT THEM RIGHT NOW

 How do you add quests to you&#39;re server? Im not focusing on custom quests... I really more want runescape based quests like Cooks assistant!

 [b]How do you add emote&#39;s to you&#39;re server? I JUST FIGURED OUT HOW TO ADD THEM I JUST NEED THEM TO APPEAR IN MY EMOTES TAB[/b]

[b] Why does my yell command automatically yell stuff like when I do a command say like ::varrock it will say the last couple of letters like it will do ::yell ck along with my command!!! So that is a must fix.. I keep hearing the command is screwed up so can someone give me a good command if that&#39;s the case...[/b]

[b] With my client Galkons Base.. When I do a command that brings up a window let&#39;s say ::bank It will disconnect and connect me back in... It works with Silab but I want it to work with mine... (A person said it&#39;s a client interface problem so if someone could give a tut on how to fix THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!![/b]

 How do you make a bow shoot long range? Cause whenever I shoot it will go up to enemy then shoot. Also how do you make it so arrows are on ground

[b] A GOOD SHOP.CFG THIS IS A MUST NEED FOR MY SERVER!!! JUST A BIG ONE WHATEVER YOU CAN FIND. (Try not to have it so rares are in every shop)[/b]

 MORE WILL BE POSTED AS I SEE/NEED MORE

I know that narrows it down to what really needs to be answered but I really need this quick


Yes I have searched these multiple times

THANKS SO MUCH FOR HELPING!!!!

EDIT
Ok people say it&#39;s my source it&#39;s not... I tried another source it doesn&#39;t work... So don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s my server unless you got proof and you can fix it...

Ok this is what&#39;s up.. Whenever I do the ::bank command OR open up a shop manually it will d/c and then log me back in... This needs to be fixed... Also as i&#39;ve seen in freescapepkz when you change you&#39;re character in the ::char command and log out and back in it would of saved you&#39;re character.. As of my server that does not happen.. So if someone could give me a solution to these.

If it&#39;s command issues and It&#39;s coded wrong please post below a little tut with you&#39;re code and how to add it and how many parts etc... Please help me quick with this I can&#39;t release my server possibly source (would be a great one) 

Thanks SO MUCH,

Check my sig</description>

not sure if the startsWith part is actually what it say, but just change the beginning of the command and BE CAREFUL
yell commands are usually around a lot of commands that will be hard to fix, like ::bank
