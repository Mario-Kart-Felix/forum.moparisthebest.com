              <p>the reason why its probably resetting/changing everythime you login is most likely because you probably tuen your router off everytime you turn your pc off…tourning your routher off for more than 30 sec’s will  reset your ip meaning you have to change ip on your dns…if you dont ever turn your routher off then i dont know what to suggest but i hope i have helped !</p>
