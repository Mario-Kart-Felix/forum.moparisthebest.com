              <p>Ok, umm so what are you saying? That you want to change the / to yell? Then thats easy. But i dont think thats the right code for yell. But change the ("/") to (“yell”) and see if that works if you want a yell system. If it deosnt put it back to the way it was and ill give you my yell system from my server.</p>

              <p>1st of all you put it as a command. You would need to make it as something else. So if you would want that to work you would have to do ::/(text) or ::/’(text). If you wanted it to work in both you would probably need to make 2 separate codes.</p>
