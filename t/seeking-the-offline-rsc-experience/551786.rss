    <description>Hello, (and by the way I&#39;m technically a noob)

so I want to play RSC offline, as in there&#39;s no need for others to connect to it.  I want to be able to log in to a specific account, let&#39;s say get to 10 firemaking, log out.  Then the next day I return and log in to that same account and I&#39;m still at 10 firemaking, it remembers me.  

Now I looked around the web and it seems EasyRSC is the most straightforward &#39;source&#39; (whatever that is), so I found a version of that, has 3 folders: Client, Distributed Client and Server.  Clicked the run_client in the Distributed Client folder and once the RS window had loaded up (graphics said RSCDAEMON in green/white letters with a woman and a bat to the right), I put in any username and password and tried to log in, no dice.  Unable to connect and in the black window alongside there was the Connection refused: connect message.  I went into the settings.ini file in the Distributed Client and the server was 127.0.0.1 and the port was 43594; according to other forum debates I saw around the web apparently that&#39;s what I need for offline play.  So what&#39;s the matter guys?  

Bear in mind two things.  First off I&#39;ve really not done this sort of stuff before so you&#39;re gonna have to hold my hand through all this.  Second, I&#39;ve got the time and the patience.  If this takes a few days and a few pages of posts so be it.  To be able to know that I can always play good old classic even if the best-known servers out there go down... that&#39;s a good feeling.  

Naturally, if it&#39;s the case that one of you guys already has a source that is up and ready for offline play I&#39;ll happily just accept that from you :)

Mark.

PS I&#39;m not after any noticeable additions to the original RSC, e.g. no hits display permanently listed to the left etc.</description>

              <p>Thanks to you both, I shall proceed from there <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Ah err not sure if anybody will see this but here goes.</p>
<p>Three more questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the moment, if I go through the gates to Al Kharid from Lumbridge, I just go through, no dialogue.  Is there a way of adding the text concerning paying 10 coins to pass?  Is there also a way to pay 10 coins?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you adjust the xp you receive for different monsters?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it ok to just edit an xml inside a gz archive, e.g. for shops.xml instead of using a compression tool?  If it’s not okay, could someone provide a link/directions to a compression tool?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>

              <p>a) - You can edit items in a shop from <span class="bbcode-b">Shops.xml</span> file - located in Server folder.</p>
<p>b) - To remove npcs from map you need to find them in <span class="bbcode-b">Npcloc.xml</span> file and remove the code - located in Server folder.</p>
<p>c) - <span class="bbcode-b">Loading.rscd</span> file and <span class="bbcode-b">Sprite.rscd</span> file - located in Client folder.</p>

<p>f) - Xp rates can be modified from <span class="bbcode-b">EasyRSC.cgf</span> file - located in Server folder.</p>
<p>g) - To change the account starting location you need to edit the <span class="bbcode-b">Template</span> file into Server - Players folder.</p>
<p>h) - Yes it’s easy, monsters levels are calculated like players levels, you need to change their atk, def, str and hp lvls from <span class="bbcode-b">NpcDef.xml</span> file from Server part and <span class="bbcode-b">Npcs.rscd</span> file from Client part.</p>
<p>i) - Compression Tools, Java JDK + JRE, Notepad++, Apache Ant, Sprites Editor, Map editor.</p>

              <p>Ah, that sounds a little hard <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  But I shall try.  Ok so here are the key questions I think:</p>
<p>a)How do I modify the items in a shop?  e.g. the shop in Edgeville has strange things like strength pots and gauntlets, where are the tinderboxes and chisels?</p>
<p>b)How do I remove npcs?  e.g. theres a wizard in each major settlement like Varrock who can offer to teleport you places.  What on earth? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>c)How do I change the graphics for the log-in screen?</p>
<p>d)How do I edit the welcome message?  e.g. there’s a mention of Noobscape, would prefer Welcome to Runescape.</p>
<p>e)How do you remove/edit server messages?  e.g. there’s a mention of getting banned for racisim and cheating etc., don’t need those <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>f)How do you modify xp rates?  In this version that I have had success with, the rate seems very fast.  I got something like 4 strength after fighting just one man, I’d prefer the rate it was set to in 2003.</p>
<p>g)How do you modify the spawn point?  When I created new characters a day or so ago, I always started in one of Fally’s banks.  I’d like to start in Lumby (I’m assuming Tutorial Island might be inaccessible given the source’s Pk background).</p>
<p>h)Is it easy-ish to modify monster levels?  e.g. if I was after progressively stronger skeletons in the wilderness, would that be possible?</p>
<p>i)are there any tools I could do with downloading from Moparscape/other sites to aid with these problems?</p>
<p>I’ve attached pictures of the different folders within the ‘source’ I’ve been using, just in case you pros need to know what sort of structure I’m messing with.</p>

<p>I brought out my old computer that I’d been using 12 months ago.  Uninstalled whatever Java was on there and replaced it with Java 6 v 35 jdk.  Set all the variable paths that I’d been told of, installed notepad++ and ant too.  Edited the Run_Server and run client files of noobscape rather than easyrsc as per previous instructions.  Then tried to load the Run_Server of noobscape.</p>
<p>It’s worked! A server control panel thing loaded up and once I’d started the server there and ran the client bat file, Noobscape loaded up and I could log in.  It also seems to remember my characters and their progress after closing/re-opening the server and turning off/restarting the PC <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  So beautiful.</p>
<p>Alas I’ve got other questions now, e.g. could it say Welcome to Runescape instead of Welcome to Noobscape, could all these random server messages be disabled, why is there no iron and steel armour in the Varrock armour store, could the login screen display the original log in screen rather than a woman and a bat… but I’ll not write them all out yet cos there’s quite a few and it’s just nice that it’s coming together now.  Seriously didn’t think we were gonna get past this hurdle <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks again for the help thus far.</p>

              <p>Yeah that sounds right. I suppose you could try adding cmd /k before the ant command, so it reads like this</p>

cmd /k ant runserver
...</code></pre>
<p>or with quotes if that doesn’t work:</p>

              <p>This is very strange.  Neither set /p=, nor cmd /k, nor cmd /k command seem to work.  Erm what I’m doing is just opening the Run_Server with notepad ++, removing whatever was in line 5, putting a new command in and then pressing the floppy disk ‘save’ icon.  Is that the process for editing it or should I be doing something else as well?</p>
<p>Also, what should the path mentioned in line 3 be exactly?  Should it be the path to the jre in Disc C, or jdk, or something else?<br>
On the EasyRSC I have it is by default C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_35;ant\bin.  Now Java for me is on Program Files (x86) rather than just Program Files, and it’s not Java 1.6, it’s Java 1.8 etc, so I’m guessing that has to be changed.  But where does the ‘ant’ fit in?</p>

<p>Try adding “cmd /k” to the end instead of pause. Apparently that keeps it open. If not, have a google for “stop bat file closing windows”. You really need to see that full error to know how to fix it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It does look like you’re on the right track though. Java and Ant appear to be working, you’re just getting an error with rscdaemon.</p>

              <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>Apache Ant is now installed as per your guide, let me know what I should do next and thanks for the help thus far.</p>
<p>Hey xAdyx, I won’t forget your comment and after having a go through this other method, whether it works or not, I shall check out your work.</p>
<p>Oh and now, when I click on Run_Server, even if I add pause to the end of the batch using notepad++, it still won’t pause.  I took two screenies of the box before it disappeared.  I’m also now attaching the screenie of the notepad++ view of the Run_Server file.  I’d edited the Path line because it was linked to a version of Java not on my machine.  I’m guessing maybe that path might be wrong, let me know.</p>
<p>One more thing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I’ve added screenies of the variables.  In the second I’m showing the end of the path that I edited as per your last post’s guide, Justin.</p>

              <p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>If you want to learn, I suggest you to use a little better version of EasyRSC, on it’s name NOOBScape v3, which is a bit more developed and some of major bugs fixed. If you can’t find it i can share mine with you, ive been working on it on my free time, and have plenty bugs fixed. For source and some help with setting it to run offline/online you can mail me or add my skype : <a href="mailto:printz-rsc@hotmail.com">printz-rsc@hotmail.com</a></p>
<p>You will need the following :</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Ant</li>
<li>Java JDK + JRE (i recommand you to use Java 6)</li>
<li>Notepad++ (i use it to edit java and xml files) or Eclipse</li>
</ul>
<p>All the best,<br>
Printz ~</p>
