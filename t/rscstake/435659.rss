<p>rscstake was my server…this is synthetic it was a good server and me and my brother dallas were the ones who brought it up. we are currently working on a server right now with a rsca source. its going to be as legit as the real rsc as it can be. just think u have to work for 3 weeks to get something and when you stake you are going to have to work for it all over again. quests will be working. beta should be up within a month 2 months tops.</p>
