              <p>when that happens it means it is nulled. but to make the shops. you should be able just to make one shop in the shop.cfg then you get 2 of the same npc and place them in diferent places. or you can just get 2 different npcs and shops with the same items just in different places. if that doesnt do anything then posrt a picture on the eror u get when u run it.</p>
