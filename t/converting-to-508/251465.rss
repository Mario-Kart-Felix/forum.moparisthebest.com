    <description>Okay i have decided to switch to a 508 server thing so i download a source (ZuberZoft 508)that some dude had released in the downloads section, and omg how does it work  :confused:? I think i can manage but i have a few questions?

[li]AutoSpawn is npcspawn.cfg[/li][/ul]


Finally i&#39;ve heard that 508 servers are very unstable, if so why is everyone saying they are going to replace the old ones, especially if most everyone i have seen has no idea how they work</description>

<p>No there isn’t, a bunch of files replaced it.</p>
<p>[ul][li]There’s a bin, build, files, src, and Worlds folder please explain (purpose, content, etc)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Bin has the binary, build has the class files, files has the client files, src has the source files.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Important files like NPCHandler, and AutoSpawn where are they at?[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Figure it out yourself.</p>
<p>[ul][li]There are folders, inside folders, inside folders, inside folders wtf?[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>That’s called packaging.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Where is the run.bat?[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The bin folder.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Where is the compiler?[/li][/ul]</p>
