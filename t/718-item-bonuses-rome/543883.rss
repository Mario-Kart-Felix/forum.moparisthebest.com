    <title>718 Item Bonuses (Rome)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-item-bonuses-rome/543883</link>
    <description>Hey guys. Quick question. 

I found an ItemBonusesUnpacker on a different forum, and used it to obviously unpack the item bonuses. After about 15 minutes it had created over 1 million text files at the designated location. I went through and noticed that some of the files actually contained bonuses, but most were just blank text files. I edited the bonuses of the whip file (4151) and re-packed the files. After another 15 minutes I started the server and logged in only to find that all my bonuses were 0.

I have searched Google for about an hour now and haven&#39;t found anything related except for the thread where I discovered the ItemBunosesUnpacker. 

So my question is how do I do this the right way? :)


thanks, bye bye.</description>

<p>The packer included in the server, but I’ve since figured out how to fix it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
