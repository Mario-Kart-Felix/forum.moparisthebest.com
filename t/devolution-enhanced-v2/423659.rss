    <title>Devolution Enhanced V2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/devolution-enhanced-v2/423659</link>
    <description>As several people have been having problems with my first release of Devolution Enhanced, I have decided to release the work I have done so far, as version 2.


[code][VERSION 1]
   [11/23/11]
   * Downloaded Devolution v7 from RageZone
   * Updated Eclipse from the older version I had
   * Started working on fixing Errors/Warnings
   
   [11/24/11]
   * Successfully fixed every Error/Warning showing in Eclipse
   * Began packaging the Server
   * Finished packaging the server
   * Organized the Config folder (Now data)
   
   [11/25 - 11/27]
   * Grounded &gt;.&lt;
   
   [11/27/11]
   * Added a skills package and a couple skill bases
   * Removed Devolution&#39;s Firemaking, in favor of a simpler base
   * Removed Devolutions Premium handlers
   * Added a Constants class, for future quick editing of the server
   * Added Admin and mod String[] &#39;s, loading on login
   * Applied every dupe patch released (Special thanks to shoopdawhoop)
   * Formatted every file, and removed all of the unnecessary notes
         (except Client.java, just too many for now)
   * Began work on an NPCAnimation file, not finished yet (Thanks killamess)
   * Finished NPCAnimations! No file though, went through NPCHandler
   
[VERSION 2]
   [11/28/11]
   * Added Grahams Cycle based Task manager to the server
   
   [11/29/11]
   * Handled Crafting/Firemaking using the Task manager
      (Boy this is wierd, too used to Scu11&#39;s tick system, I guess)
   * Handled Commands 
   * Added a few more variables to the Constants class
   * Fixed up Item.java, removed every item past the 317 revision, and
         listed the items in order of least -&gt; greatest
   
   [11/30/11]
   * Fixed NPC Animation bugs
   * Started work on a Packet handling system, removed it temporarily
         to release what I have as v2
   * Cleaned up Client.java a bit, decided to release as v2 since people
         were experiencing problems[/code]

Like I said in my previous thread, I realize that this will not be popular, and most of you will flame this. But I am releasing it for those who want it.

If anyone experiences problems with this, feel free to PM me.

<p>Edit: I still can’t attack anything, but I’m sure its a problem on my end. I know you said you tested it out, and I do believe you. I still love this source because it truly is an enhanced Devolution. I don’t have a problem with other Devolution bases, it seems to be a problem with my client. Maybe, not sure. Do you have a client that works with this?[/quote]</p>
<p>I included a client with this.</p>
