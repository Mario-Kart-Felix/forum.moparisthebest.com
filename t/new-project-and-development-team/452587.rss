    <title>New project and Development Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-project-and-development-team/452587</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m just here to post an idea of what i&#39;m thinking of doing for my next project and i decided i would like to include some people from the community somehow in this one so if any of you are interested either post or let me know through Pm(:


Well i&#39;m pretty much ready to start a new project and whatnot so i was wondering if any of you guys would like to be part of the development Team and use your skills and implement them into a nice server.

~Programmers/Gfx artist/Forums-website designer~

If you have any of the following skills under your belt or knowledge wise and would like to start a project with me, let me know. 

As of ideas on what the server should be or how it should come out with originality is something that we will talk about once the development team starts to come together.

Reason for this is mentioned before, i want everyone on the Team to be part of the server itself and have there ideas put into it and see them come to life.

Thanks- 4ces!</description>
