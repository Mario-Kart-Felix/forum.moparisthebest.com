    <title>[PI] Make Objects Reload</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-make-objects-reload/437502</link>
    <description>I have a lot of custom objects and such being loaded in one area. However, I have just recently finished making the nearby staircase working in the region, and it moves you  to the same coordinate but it just only changes the height.

I have it set up to load certain objects at a certain height so not every level of the castle has the same objects that are being spawned. However, when you use the staircase it does indeed bring you up in height by 1 but the objects that are supposed to be loading at height 1 don&#39;t load because it&#39;s set to load only if the region changes so all the objects that were loaded at height 0 don&#39;t update or unload.

I&#39;ve tried adding this to each of the staircase cases in ActionHandler,
[code]
		c.getPA().removeObjects();
		Server.objectManager.loadObjects(c);
[/code]
but nothing seems to be really changing. Is there a better way to do this?

Thanks a lot.</description>
