    <description>Hey everyone, I was on here a long time ago but I couldn&#39;t even remember my username so I have a couple of questions about servers.

I read something about a 508 Client or something and I&#39;m just wondering if anyone can tell me and explain to me what it is exactly.

Thanks Tim Jr.</description>
