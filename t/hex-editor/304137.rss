    <title>Hex Editor?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hex-editor/304137</link>
    <description>Today at school, my friend told me that the reason he had so much money on my server was that he used a Hex Editor. Right as he was beginning to tell me how he used it, the teacher interrupted us and I forgot to ask him after class. But when I asked him first how he did it, he said he chose a program that was running, which was my client, and linked it with the hex editor and edited a few files and was able to change the item value. First off, what is a hex editor? I have one downloaded on to my computer, I just don&#39;t know how to use it. Also, how do you use a hex editor. I geuss I&#39;m just going to have to Jar my client files from now on? :P</description>

              <p>You cant hack with hex-editors, because their function is to edit text that is in the .exe not actually editing what the memory stores. Mainly, hex editors are used to leech private servers, for example i know for GunZ servers, people use a hex editor to change the ip the client connects to and also the title. Your friend probably meant a cheat engine. To hack runescape though you would need to hook winsock to force packets to be sent to their server. Anyway, still very hard because Jagex has something that verifies packets.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 30, 2009, 04:57:41 pm[/size][hr][quote=“Kihomura, post:14, topic:304137”]It’s a retarded piece of software like Artmoney and Cheatengine.[/quote]</p>

              <p>People used this so scam people on runescape via youtube videos. It doesn’t really change the value, just the image on the client. What it does, is takes the value that you put into the hex editor, the hex editor reads it, and it manipulates the number on the actual client to a different number. The thing is, if you spend any of it, it doesn’t value to the actual amount you changed it to. It just changes the number, not the actual amount you have.</p>

              <p>Today at school, my friend told me that the reason he had so much money on my server was that he used a Hex Editor. Right as he was beginning to tell me how he used it, the teacher interrupted us and I forgot to ask him after class. But when I asked him first how he did it, he said he chose a program that was running, which was my client, and linked it with the hex editor and edited a few files and was able to change the item value. First off, what is a hex editor? I have one downloaded on to my computer, I just don’t know how to use it. Also, how do you use a hex editor. I geuss I’m just going to have to Jar my client files from now on? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
