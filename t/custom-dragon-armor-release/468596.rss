<p>Thanks for the responses and i didn’t know those are jagex’s wings lol and why do people hate on custom items??? If you look at project rainbow everybody J I Z Z S on custom items, yet when someone else post stuff with customs people hate, so weird.  Now I’m not saying this model or those are other models are the best, just saying I’m sure not all people hate customs…to me they are just for show and character outfits to hangout and socialize and maybe even show off your wealth in that server</p>

<p>I was actually offered a programming position from Project Rainbow. Their Custom features were one of many reasons I turned it down.</p>

              <p>In my humble honest opinion… this looks strange when worn. I’m not saying It’s bad, but I don’t like it. These are the type of Customs that Veteran Players tend to dislike or avoid. I don’t know why the RuneScape Private Server Community like to have black wings on their Characters. I mean, I can understand Administrators having wings of some sort, but they should be there to help Players be able to instantly differentiate Administrative Staffers from others. Something that stands out and looks good. There are already Flight Animations prepared for Player Characters. Perhaps using this Animation + REAL Custom wings? Here’s an example of the type of wings I had in mind:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://www.dragonwings.net/images/2012HugeUprightAngelWingsFront5128dm_small.jpg" title="2012HugeUprightAngelWingsFront5128dm_small.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://www.dragonwings.net/images/2012HugeUprightAngelWingsFront5128dm_small.jpg" alt width="329" height="500"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">2012HugeUprightAngelWingsFront5128dm_small.jpg</span><span class="informations">331×502</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>P.S. The Model you posted has holes in the wings. I don’t think they would be very aerodynamic.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I’m not criticizing this - just giving my feedback.</p>
