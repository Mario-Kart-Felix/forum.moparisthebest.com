    <description>In your opinion do you think they are just god awful compared to wow, or just bad in general... Or do you think they are alright, and getting better.

Post opinions with a friendly comment (no runescape is shit, gtfo this board if you feel this way)

Read this about graphics.

[url=http://services.runescape.com/m=news/behind-the-scenes--september]http://services.runescape.com/m=news/behind-the-scenes--september[/url]

The graphics are going to get better, and better. They are getting more sources to choose how their graphics work.

Notice, they are stopping with the flat squared things (such as 317, those are horrible)

They are smoothening everything out. Full hd, ect.

Also! They had a new clothing update! Clothing now looks real, and legit, instead of plain clothing, they have like 50+ colors, and so many different options.

Post your opinions below!</description>

              <p>WoW graphics are incomparable to Runescape’s really, I find them both completely different.  WoW is somewhat not a whole lot of geometry, and a fuck load of textures, and Runescape graphics are heavily improved via geometry and not a lot of textures, I mean, in 317 Runescape there was less than 50 textures used in the whole game, wonder how many were in WoW at that time? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

I don’t need incredible graphics to enjoy a game. I liked the old RuneScape graphics, not this new HD shit. I am however hoping that the new update will make it easier to see D-claw rushers in the wilderness.</p>
<p>I like the new clothes however I don’t understand why on some outfits they have designs that look like armor you could buy/armor that looks like you’re naked.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why do you like the old graphics better? They are blocks. I like the old gameframe, and old weapons, but the characters/animations were just horrible. Did you like the graphics of the old Runescape, or the gameplay (free trade, ect)</p>
<p>I also agree with you on the new clothing, some of it looks like clothing you can buy (guthix robes, ect)[/quote]<br>
Gives the player a more classic feeling, you know?</p>

<p>Read this about graphics.</p>

<p>The graphics are going to get better, and better. They are getting more sources to choose how their graphics work.</p>
<p>Notice, they are stopping with the flat squared things (such as 317, those are horrible)</p>
<p>They are smoothening everything out. Full hd, ect.</p>
<p>Also! They had a new clothing update! Clothing now looks real, and legit, instead of plain clothing, they have like 50+ colors, and so many different options.</p>
<p>Post your opinions below!</p>
