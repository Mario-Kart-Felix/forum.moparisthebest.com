    <description>Three men walk into a bar. It&#39;s getting close to closing time, and the bartender tries his best to conceal his chagrin that these gentlemen are coming in so late.

One of the men, noting the bartender&#39;s abrupt change in demeanor, walks over to the bar and orders a gin and tonic for himself, slipping the bartender a $100 as payment. &quot;Gee, thanks mister!&quot; The bartender exclaims. He continues to say, &quot;Where&#39;d you get that kind of money that you can just throw cash around like that?&quot; The man replies, &quot;My friends over there and I found a genie in a lamp that granted us each one wish. I simply wished to be the richest man in the world.&quot; The bartender, stunned, simply passes the man his gin and tonic, and the man leaves the bar.

The second man comes up, and immediately, women seem to materialize from nowhere to dote on him. &quot;Red Bull and vodka for me,&quot; the man says. The bartender replies, &quot;I guess you wished to be the most attractive man in the world?&quot; as he passes the man his drink. The man simply nods and winks at the bartender as if confirming his suggestion, and walks back to his booth to join his two other friends.

The third man then approaches the bar, and the bartender wonders how he didn&#39;t notice that the man has an orange for a head. Not wanting to appear too brusque, the bartender asks cautiously, &quot;So, uh... what did you wish for?&quot; The man replied, &quot;I wished to have an orange for a head.&quot;

              <p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy, and this young boy was having<br>
his 10th birthday. His father thinking that it was an important day for<br>
his young lad, said to him, ‘You can have anything that you want for<br>
your birthday’.<br>
The boy thought and thought. Finally, he said to his pop, “Dad, I want a<br>
green golf ball.” The man was surprised a bit, but decided to humour his son.<br>
And so, the boy recieved 1 green golf ball for his 10th birthday.</p>
<p>On this boy’s 13th birthday, when he hit his teens, the father once again<br>
walked up to the boy, and told him what he had before. The boy thought. And<br>
thought. Finally, he said, “Dad, I want 10 green golf balls.” Now, the father<br>
was slightly curious about this, and he almost asked his son why. But then he<br>
decided that it was just youthfulness, and left it at that.</p>
<p>Upon graduating from High School, the boy was once again given that same<br>
offer by his father. He thought and thought and thought. Finally, he went up<br>
to his old man and said, “Dad, I want 100 green golf balls.” Now, the father<br>
was very curious about this, and asked his son, finally, why he wanted the<br>
balls. The boy just said, “Dad! It’s a secret!” The father backed down, and got<br>
the boy his balls.</p>
<p>When the boy graduated from college, his father once again offered him anything<br>
he wanted. Once again, the boy thought. Once again, the boy walked up to his<br>
father. He said, “Dad, I want 1000 green golf balls.” The father decided that<br>
the boy knew how to live his life. But still he asked, “Why, son? Why do you<br>
want these green golf balls?” And once again, the boy said,“It’s a secret,<br>
Dad!”</p>
<p>And then came the war. And the boy volunteered himself for his country. And<br>
when he came back in one piece, his father said, “Son, I will get you anything<br>
that you want!” And the boy thought. And thought. And he said, “Dad, I want<br>
10,000 green golfballs.” And the father could not hold back his question any<br>
longer. “Why? Why, son? Why do you need these green golf balls?” And the son<br>
looked at thim, and he said,“Dad, now, I told you that it was a secret. Please<br>
don’t make me tell you.” And the father backed off.</p>
<p>The boy got married. His father walked up to him, and offered him anything he<br>
would want on this joyous occasion. The boy thought and thought and thought.<br>
And thought. And, finally, he said,“Dad… I want 100,000 green golf balls…”<br>
And the father, keeping calm, asked why. Why the boy wanted so many green golf<br>
balls. And all the boy could do was look at his father, and say,“It’s a<br>
secret.” And the father kept silent.</p>
<p>Then, tragedy struck. There was a car accident. The boy was mortally injured.<br>
And the father went to see the son in his final hour. And he asked his son if<br>
there was anything he could get him. And the son whispered,“Father… Please<br>
get me 1,000,000 green golf balls…” And the father almost wept. He said,“Son,<br>
please tell me why you want these green golf balls…” And the son looked at<br>
his father, and he said, “Alright, dad…”</p>
<p>And then he died.</p>

              <p>Three men walk into a bar. It’s getting close to closing time, and the bartender tries his best to conceal his chagrin that these gentlemen are coming in so late.</p>
<p>One of the men, noting the bartender’s abrupt change in demeanor, walks over to the bar and orders a gin and tonic for himself, slipping the bartender a $100 as payment. “Gee, thanks mister!” The bartender exclaims. He continues to say, “Where’d you get that kind of money that you can just throw cash around like that?” The man replies, “My friends over there and I found a genie in a lamp that granted us each one wish. I simply wished to be the richest man in the world.” The bartender, stunned, simply passes the man his gin and tonic, and the man leaves the bar.</p>
<p>The second man comes up, and immediately, women seem to materialize from nowhere to dote on him. “Red Bull and vodka for me,” the man says. The bartender replies, “I guess you wished to be the most attractive man in the world?” as he passes the man his drink. The man simply nods and winks at the bartender as if confirming his suggestion, and walks back to his booth to join his two other friends.</p>
<p>The third man then approaches the bar, and the bartender wonders how he didn’t notice that the man has an orange for a head. Not wanting to appear too brusque, the bartender asks cautiously, “So, uh… what did you wish for?” The man replied, “I wished to have an orange for a head.”</p>
