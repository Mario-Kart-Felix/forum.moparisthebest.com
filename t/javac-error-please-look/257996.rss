    <title>Javac error - PLEASE LOOK</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/javac-error-please-look/257996</link>
    <description>I have read the stickies. Didn&#39;t find a solution so that is why I&#39;m posting.

This account was registered on Oct 26, 2006 and I have had this error before and fixed it but however, I jsut keep forgetting how... Well this is the problem:

I downloaded a Runescape Classic client, and when I click the .bat file to start playing, I get the classical &quot;[i]&#39;javac&#39; isn&#39;t recognized...[/i]&quot; error. Please, how do I fix this?

The more detailed the better. Thank you for reading.</description>
