    <title>My server has been up, but now people can&#39;t get on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server-has-been-up-but-now-people-cant-get-on/219788</link>
    <description>Anyone have any Ideas to why no one can get on my server? Of course I can still get on it without typing an IP and connecting. But no one is able to connect with my IP... 

I went to sleep and it was running, I woke up and my computer was restarted and when i turned my server on, no one that plays it normally could log on. If there are any pictures someone needs to see, or if i posted this in the wrong area, please let me know.</description>
