    <title>Prayer and Hp orbs not draining</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prayer-and-hp-orbs-not-draining/552594</link>
    <description>So... i&#39;m using a different client but same source and for some reason the prayer orbs and hp orbs are not draining.. but with the source that is for the client they both drain without a problem. So is this in the server side or what could be the cause of this?</description>

              <p>Obviously it’s the source since you’ve changed a variable in this situation.</p>
<p>Your new source possibly doesn’t recognise the different sprites to do with hp draining (could be wrong as I’ve never used hp draining on a server).</p>
