    <title>Deathlypvpz 4.1 Client doesnt start up!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deathlypvpz-4-1-client-doesnt-start-up/544458</link>
    <description>So people i got this problem for 3 days now, and it seems nobody can help me. I got skype and Teamviewer btw. But the problem is i jarred and signed my client, so i got now a &#39;MyClientName.jar&#39; but when i try to start it up nothing starts up. .bat file says : &#39;&#39;Could not find or load main class client.&#39;&#39;

But in my server&#39;s client map there&#39;s a run.bat, if i try to start that up my client loads perfect....

I am getting mad! :palm: Someone help me :( PM me for skype, or we can use teamviewer.

SO THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT THE .jar CLIENT DOESNT START UP, with that error!</description>

<p>DUDE THATS NOT EVEN THE RUN.BAT FILE.</p>
<p>THATS THE FILE THAT GETS GENERATED AFTER YOU MAKE A .JAR CLIENT.</p>
<p>YOU’RE SO SMART!!!</p>
