    <title>Shop Buy/Sell Number Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-buy-sell-number-question/254037</link>
    <description>Alright, so I have a pretty noob question. I just recently added an elf mini-game, but I am having a problem with the shop.

As the shop uses fingernails instead of GP, you can only buy/sell stuff in that shop for fingernails.

Unfortunately, the shop buys ANYTHING, so you could sell a whip for 4M fingernails which would allow you to buy everything in the shop.

Here is my shops.cfg line:

[code]shop = 72	Fingernail_Shop!	2	2	1038	20000	1040	20000	1042	20000	1044	20000	1046	20000	1048	20000	76	100[/code]

Sorry that is all crammed together, the code tags did that. Here it is without code tags:



shop = 72	Fingernail_Shop!	2	2	1038	20000	1040	20000	1042	20000	1044	20000	1046	20000	1048	20000	76	100



The ID 2 and 2 are the buy sell integers.

I want to have:
[ul][li]Only allowed to sell back what is in the shop.[/li]
[li]Not allowed to sell other items to the shop.[/li]
[li]Can buy from the shop, working right now just incase you have to change it[/li][/ul]


Thanks in your return. If you need any further information, please feel free to ask. Thanks.</description>
