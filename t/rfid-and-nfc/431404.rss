    <description>Due to the increasing frequency that I&#39;ve been locking the keys in my car, I&#39;ve decided to make a device that unlocks the driver-side door when the keys are within about 2 meters. That way, I could never lock the keys in the car again. I&#39;m just not sure how I would go about doing this. I know the basics (attach receiver to 12V, attach transmitter to key ring) but there are many different ways of accomplishing it. What would your suggestions be for going about this? I&#39;ve also come up with a few constraints that should limit the implementation.

1. Both the receiver and transmitter should have minimal power consumption.
2. The signal shouldn&#39;t be hindered (greatly) by interference (like the chassis of the car).
3. The transmitter shouldn&#39;t go more than 2-3 meters.

Now, after the first implementation, I might make it more functional (by adding a switch for which doors to open), but for right now, one will do. So what are some things you guys can suggest?</description>

<p>I’d suggest putting a key that will only open the door.</p>
<p>For more suggestions or to get someone to implement these, contact a local locksmith.</p>

<p>How do you lock yourself in?  Forgive me but I just got my first car, and I can’t get my head around how you would lock yourself out…  I mean I’d have to manually lock the door from outside, then slip the keys through the sunroof or window to lock myself out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Usually what happens is I go in to grab something, put the keys on the passenger seat, grab what I went to look for, and lock the door with the switch on the door.</p>
<p>As for the “hacking”, I would use a signal frequency, or transmission packet that only I would know. Besides, if they really wanted to get in, they could just use a rock and break the window.</p>
