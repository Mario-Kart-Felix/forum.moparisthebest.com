    <title>Every Server is Down Almost All the Time!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/every-server-is-down-almost-all-the-time/254751</link>
    <description>When I go to moparisthebest.com, the game loads up fine. Whenever I enter an ip and port number, I get &quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down.&quot; (even when I start my own server). This doesn&#39;t come up all the time though. I usually get to play for a few minutes before it kicks me off. When I do get kicked off, I usually have to wait a day or two before I can play again. 

I have tried the following internet browsers: Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Opera. I have tried getting on on three different computers as well. I made sure that all the browsers and the Java I have installed were up to date. No matter what i try, I get the same problem. I know the servers aren&#39;t down because this happens with every single one even if they are on the server status page. Please help me figure this out.</description>

              <p>If the server isn’t on, then all of them must be off because this problem occurs with every server I try. I even go down the list trying around 30 servers. I am also making absolutely sure that I am using the correct ip and port that I am given. I don’t know about the flooding, but I know I’m not doing anything wrong. My friend has no problems with this, so he came over to my house to give it a shot. We were still having problems even after that.</p>

              <p>The problems are either</p>
<p>1.) The server isnt actually on<br>
2.) When you try to log into your server you leave the ip part blank OR fill in 127.0.0.0 ( i think )<br>
3.) The server is currently is getting flooded and its wL<br>
4.) Your doing something wrong</p>
