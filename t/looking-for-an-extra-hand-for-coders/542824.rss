    <title>Looking for an extra hand for coders</title>

    <description>Looking for an extra hand on deck for my server, VPS and Website are paid for as of now.

Looking for at least a decent amount of experience, someone that can become a friend of us
all (the community) easily, and just someone who will be laid back but work when needed.

PM me for further discussion, thank you.</description>
