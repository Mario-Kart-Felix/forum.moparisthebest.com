    <title>Sync Folders Across Two Computers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sync-folders-across-two-computers/436619</link>
    <description>I had been using Microsoft Sharepoint until recently when I just got fed up with it because of stupid little things that annoyed me.

Right now, I&#39;m using Microsoft Live Mesh.. I didn&#39;t want to replace one microsoft product with another but I couldn&#39;t find anything else that worked the way I needed it to.

Now, I&#39;m noticing that if Live Mesh is running and I&#39;m using one of the files that is in a sync folder, it will constantly try to sync it until it is no longer in use.. This causes Mesh to use 100% of my CPU until it is able to sync.

The computers experiencing this problem are decent computers, yet Mesh manages to bring them to a near standstill if one of the files is in use.

tl;dr, Microsoft products are absolute shit and I need an alternative to keep a folder synced across two computers.

Surely there is something that can do this? :)</description>

<p>However, if you are talking about syncing files between two computers on your network or something, you probably don’t want to upload and then download everything to the internet, so I’d recommend rsync.  I think there are builds for windows as well.</p>
