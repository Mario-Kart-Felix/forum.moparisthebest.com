    <description>Right Everyone, i got a source of Blurr&#39;s Client, Ive still got all credits to him cause hes awesome
ive changed the ip and everything and when i try to connect to my server on the client, it logs me in the straight back out?, my other client works fine, but i was wondering how i would get this client to work with the source

any ideas?

Thanks
