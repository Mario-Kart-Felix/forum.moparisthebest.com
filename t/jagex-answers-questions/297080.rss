    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Subcomfreak asks:
We all know about the game screen random shift to get rid of auto-clickers, and complex macros made by players themselves with a recorder, but how could you detect the most advance auto-fighter, foe example the newest sythe (I don&#39;t use it I just was browsing on a fan site and saw it! Never downloaded it or used it, So don&#39;t look at me like I&#39;m a bad guy ) Which has anti-ban features, logs you out when you run out of hp, eats, and uses a spec atk every 10 monsters!!!! How can you detect stuff like that?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We cannot share information regarding how we detect macros - to do so would compromise the systems we use and make circumvention easier. However, the macro detection systems used by Jagex are among the most complex in the games industry and we can detect any and every form of macroing in the game. Many people seem to believe that with anti-ban features they will never be caught, but that simply isn’t the case. We’ve yet to see a macro that is even partially good at going undetected.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Kevin Aqua asks:
I&#39;m just really curious if someone actually looks over the appeal etc. before sending out automated/ pre-set messages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As to the automated reply issue, it’s been a long held view that a Jagex bot checks offence appeals before denying them and sending an auto reply. That simply isn’t true - at least, I’m not a bot and I check them! :)

What actually occurs is that we see the appeal, we assess it against the evidence and then come to a decision to grant or deny the appeal. In either case, a reply is generated by our systems. Our focus is to clear offence appeals as quickly as possible in order to get people back in game with minimal interruption. It would be simply too time intensive to reply to every appeal with a personal message. Having said that, Mod Kelvin does look a bit like Data from Star Trek; does that count as a Jagex bot? :)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Symeh asks:
What Will Jagex Be Doing About Private Servers, Shutting More Down?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Private servers are illegal. The law is very clear in this area and we will continue to force private server owners to close their operations - through legal action, if necessary. If you know of one, please report it in the ‘Contact us’ section of the forums and we’ll do the rest.

Just thought I&#39;d post the most relevant QAs for anyone who hasn&#39;t read the thread on the RS forums yet.

The answer to #1 is obviously a bluff, but they did indeed notice the utter shittiness of these so called &quot;anti-bans&quot; in rsbot/any other clone of rsbot/ scripts.
It does show that they do take the chance and have a look through rsbot/any other clone of rsbot that is open source/ source code and scripts.

And apparently they do look through ban appeals? Seems like they lied because apparently people supplied totally silly appeals and were unbanned.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We all know about [...], and complex macros made by players themselves with a recorder,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
......what?</description>

<p>Safe bet.</p>
<p>Effectively what you’re saying is that you’ve detected many systems and all of them fail to impress you. Since the only benchmark I have in determining if my system lives up to your standards is noting if any of my bots are banned, I suppose I’ll wait for my armies to be hit with the ban-stick… Although I must say I may be holding my breath… some of these characters are over 3 years old…</p>

<p>I could be wrong… you could be waiting for me to reach 1000 bots. Who knows?</p>

There anti-macro is indeed very complex, I’ve done cheating on different mmorpgs which was fairly easy (2moons/dekaron).<br>
But it definitely doesn’t detect all bots, otherwise they would kick/ban automatically (or after a while). While still many of my bots aren’t banned, even over a year. (not cheated regularly, but even my test accounts survive and they look massively like a bot XD)<br>
Anti-bans which are done by the bot are bad, since it doesn’t know about current state. Anti-ban in scripts are helpful (the reason why we removed it :P) Still doesn’t provide 100% undetectability obviously.</p>
<p>Apeals aren’t read really, as pointed out. We have had multiple threads on rsbot containing the most idiocy accepted appeals <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Private servers aren’t taken down that much, I mean moparscape is still running, they should know about it by know <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>‘complex macros made by recorders’, well basically it’s useless these days but you could record your actions (like fletch/bank) and then repeat it a number of times. I think that’s what he means.</p>

              <blockquote>Subcomfreak asks:
We all know about the game screen random shift to get rid of auto-clickers, and complex macros made by players themselves with a recorder, but how could you detect the most advance auto-fighter, foe example the newest sythe (I don't use it I just was browsing on a fan site and saw it! Never downloaded it or used it, So don't look at me like I'm a bad guy ) Which has anti-ban features, logs you out when you run out of hp, eats, and uses a spec atk every 10 monsters!!!! How can you detect stuff like that?</blockquote>
<p>We cannot share information regarding how we detect macros - to do so would compromise the systems we use and make circumvention easier. However, the macro detection systems used by Jagex are among the most complex in the games industry and we can detect any and every form of macroing in the game. Many people seem to believe that with anti-ban features they will never be caught, but that simply isn’t the case. We’ve yet to see a macro that is even partially good at going undetected.</p>
<blockquote>Kevin Aqua asks:
I'm just really curious if someone actually looks over the appeal etc. before sending out automated/ pre-set messages.</blockquote>
<p>As to the automated reply issue, it’s been a long held view that a Jagex bot checks offence appeals before denying them and sending an auto reply. That simply isn’t true - at least, I’m not a bot and I check them! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>What actually occurs is that we see the appeal, we assess it against the evidence and then come to a decision to grant or deny the appeal. In either case, a reply is generated by our systems. Our focus is to clear offence appeals as quickly as possible in order to get people back in game with minimal interruption. It would be simply too time intensive to reply to every appeal with a personal message. Having said that, Mod Kelvin does look a bit like Data from Star Trek; does that count as a Jagex bot? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<blockquote>Symeh asks:
What Will Jagex Be Doing About Private Servers, Shutting More Down?</blockquote>
<p>Private servers are illegal. The law is very clear in this area and we will continue to force private server owners to close their operations - through legal action, if necessary. If you know of one, please report it in the ‘Contact us’ section of the forums and we’ll do the rest.<br>

<p>Just thought I’d post the most relevant QAs for anyone who hasn’t read the thread on the RS forums yet.</p>
<p>The answer to <span class="hashtag">#1</span> is obviously a bluff, but they did indeed notice the utter shittiness of these so called “anti-bans” in rsbot/any other clone of rsbot/ scripts.<br>
It does show that they do take the chance and have a look through rsbot/any other clone of rsbot that is open source/ source code and scripts.</p>
<p>And apparently they do look through ban appeals? Seems like they lied because apparently people supplied totally silly appeals and were unbanned.</p>

......what?
