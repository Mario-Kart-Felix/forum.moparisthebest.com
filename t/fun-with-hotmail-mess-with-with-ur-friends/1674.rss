    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fun-with-hotmail-mess-with-with-ur-friends/1674</link>
    <description>Yo bro&#39;s, im thinkin of makin another hotmail messer arounder funner thinger, i just need some help from some1 whos good at html.

my first messer was a hotmail cookie cleaner, basicly, sign in to hotmail (not msn) then rite click on &quot;sign out&quot; hit &quot;copy link location&quot;

then hit new message

then add html tags,  a &quot;click here&quot; in javascript (??)  and boom u got an email that says &quot;click here&quot; the person clicks on it and msn.com pops up. they think, oooo, then hit inbox (or etc.) and it asks them to log in again. very nooby.

i wanna make 1 that changes like, there name, there age, there country etc...
im thinkin it aint gonna be hard but i dont know how 2 do it.  i need a partner/ teacher.

Over and Out!</description>

<p>My hotmail account has my paypal password in an email, it has passwords to forums I sign up, etc. he could do a lot of damage this way, there is no difference in making a fake hotmail page or a fake runescape page. How do we know it's only to play around with his friends? And een if it is, if my friend got into my account I'd knock his teeth out, doesnt sound like a good friend to me.</p>

<p>I don't think we'd approve of you stealing hotmail accounts.</p>

<p>Trust me, very important information gets sent through emails, such as passwords. You shouldn't invade other's privacy, it's extremely illegal.</p>
