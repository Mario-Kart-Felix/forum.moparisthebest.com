    <title>Just a small bit of advise</title>

    <description>Ok this is stupid i guess but im bored and havent slept in 72 hours so il post it. My cuz is not that good with runescript or whatever this sub java language is. the first command he saw was .startswith instead of .equalsIgnoreCase. so soon he had commands that crashed the server, because he used startswith when it wasnt nesseasary. 

Story asside heres my advice, from what i know, if you command doesnt use substrings dont use startswith, 

Ex. say you make a command to spawn full guthans, you make it short so you dont have to type much &quot;G&quot; and you use startswith, then you would lag out on entering it because of the &quot;gfx&quot; command because gfx does start with g.

now im gunna go eat more sugar...lol</description>

              <p>derk, i ment that you should use .equalsIgnoreCase whenever the command doesnt use substringsand is fairly short, using startswith alot when you dont need to  might cause a problem. yea with the command fire cape, you wouldnt need to worry because i doubt your gunna make another command like “fire cape now”, but if you did you would probly crash if u typed ::fire cape</p>

              <p>Not true, I never see commands that crash server’s that start with <code>command.startsWith</code><br>
So,<br>
if you wanted a command to spawn a fire cape, it’d be <code>if (command.startsWith("fire cape")) 
{ 
	sendMessage("Free fire cape."); 
	addItem(6570,1); 
} 
 </code></p>
<p>Which means, if you type ::firecape you get 1 fire cape, with the message saying Free fire cape. ^^</p>
