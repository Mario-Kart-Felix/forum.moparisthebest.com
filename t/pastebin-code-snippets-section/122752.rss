    <title>Pastebin / Code snippets section?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pastebin-code-snippets-section/122752</link>
    <description>We could have actual tutorials in the tutorial section, and code snippets, autospawns, errors, and other text files in the pastebin section. I think it&#39;s a good idea because it keeps the quality level in the tutorial section by giving another place to put those types of posts. It could be something like a less formal section, and a useful place to post all of these chat logs from the IRC, errors, and cool stuff that doesn&#39;t merit having its own tutorial.

I got the original idea from Stanyer after it was posted in the tutorials section. Also, there&#39;s really no place for non-vets to post their suggestions. Perhaps we should have a General Discussion section for moparscape?</description>

              <p>That’s what I suggested a while back, a board to post things like that, but no one really supported it or took the time to view is =S</p>

              <p>yar, or just make a paste bin type thing, like sppts paste bin.<br>
Because that lays out like posts, so people can browse through that.<br>
When i first set up <a href="http://javacisnotrecognized.com" rel="nofollow noopener">javacisnotrecognized.com</a>, sppt offered me his paste bin, and im pretty sure if mopar doesn’t have it sppt would let mopar use and adapt it<br>
<a href="http://www.javacisnotrecognized.com/pastebin/index.php?pv=all" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.javacisnotrecognized.com/pastebin/index.php?pv=all</a>.</p>
<p>That would do good for things like autospawns if mopar set one up IE: <a href="http://pb.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">pb.moparisthebest.com</a> or <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/pastebin" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/pastebin</a></p>
