    <title>How exactly does aryan work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-exactly-does-aryan-work/2342</link>
    <description>curious as to what exactly is aryan. is it basically just a client hack that injects code into certain mem addresses, or is it something more? is someone out there can tell me exactly what it is, besides just a &quot;leet ass bot&quot; as others have put it. Also, whats sbot, does it work in the same way.</description>

<p>With flagging however, the mouse position is sent as well but not to control your character. I presume, they calculate could you have performed that action from your mouse click - if not there might be an error threashold untill bannage.</p>

              <p>i still dont quite understand how the mouse works.  i mean you can send “click here” packets to the server, but does it also fake mouse movements. Btw, whilst i could go all through the code, Im not the best java programmer in the world, and I have looked at the code, and most of it is undocumented. So if someone knows could they please save me the time.</p>

              <p>[quote=“RegeX, post:3, topic:2342”]I don’t know whether your question in sincere (sp =)), but thanks for the interest anyway.</p>
<p>It’ll require a bit of coding knowledge, but basically Aryan is the normal RuneScape client, with our own code build on top of it. For the OOP minded, the Aryan base extends the RuneScape client.</p>
<p>As for executing actions, the Aryan you probably has uses our action hijacking system.<br>
Normally in RuneScape, when you click a button, or attack a monster, the following details are set:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Action ID[/li]<br>
[li]Action Name (Attack - Lah, e.g)[/li]<br>
[li]Action Parameters (A list of relevant arguments, for example, the (x,y), or perhaps the NPC id?)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Somewhere during the RuneScape loop, the code interprets these details, and sends the appropriate packet.<br>
This is how RuneScape and actions work.</p>
<p>Now, we add Aryan. This setting of details is the result of an input event, for example, the click of a mouse or a press of a button.<br>
What Aryan does is, create an input event (usually a move &amp; click), to the correct location where possible.<br>
Now, if this was all we did, we would have SCAR…<br>
What happens next is, right before the method that interprets set details is processed, we HIJACK this method, and insert our own little code replacing the details with the correct once.</p>
<p>Hence, we have an action, and is still proven undetectable (not the bot, the way of hijacking an action).<br>
So, we might click for example, and get the following details:</p>
<p>[ul][li]100 - “Walk Here”, 432432423[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>but we can replace it with</p>
<p>[ul][li]120 - “Attack”, 10[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The action is still fired from an input event, and everything works out just dandy.</p>
<p>As for your SBoT question, I am not aware of their current system. I know they used to action force (DIRECTLY INVOKE the action processing method, and used this system at one time)</p>
<p>-RegeX.[/quote]<br>
thats EXACTLY what i was going to say <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>basically runescape works by us clicking the screen, a message is then sent to the client, and then to the server,<br>
eg: if we right click and attack a rat, the server sends an attack message to the client, giving the command, npc id and location. The client then checks that location for the rat, if its there then you attack the rat.<br>
aryan is a modified version of the runescape client, it basically can be modified to look like anything. you can make it so you right click on a cow and it has the option to make out with it.<br>
nothing will happen, but you can still make it appear that way.<br>
aryan reads scripts, and it tells aryan what messages to send to the server.<br>
like sending that attack rat command over and over again, without you actually clicking the screen because its reading and sending the messages from the script your running.</p>

              <p>yea, I’m truly curious as to whether or not Aryan can/does send the password and username information out to a server. Afterall, you do have to allow the javaw and java files out. Although I am unsure if another tunnel can be created in addition to the main (RS servers). I noticed that Aryan does record the un and pass for ease of use, but maybe there’s code to send out that information with malicious intent. Heh, just thought about that. Have to go decompile and check now -.-.</p>

<p>As for you not being convinced, you’re right. Anything that is a truly public work is going to be detectable sooner than later, and is going to be hard to fix. It’s simply because you have the most attention, and that makes you the target for Jagex.<br>
I simply said so because I haven’t seen any evidence to the contrary (exclusively regarding the action hijack), so sorry if you misunderstood.</p>

              <p>neat, but i dont think im quite convinced, infact im sure theyll detect it sooner or later. im sticking with SCAR from the time being, although i do understand pretty much how it works now. Im still under the impression scar will sooner or later be made to an extent where we can fake human mouse movements. im working on some right now. as for the java hijack, i think its absolutely ingenious to exploit the client like that. one thing im not so certain of however is what happens with mouse movements. is the client also hijacked and a corrosponding set of mousemovements sent</p>

              <p>I don’t know whether your question in sincere (sp =)), but thanks for the interest anyway.</p>
<p>It’ll require a bit of coding knowledge, but basically Aryan is the normal RuneScape client, with our own code build on top of it. For the OOP minded, the Aryan base extends the RuneScape client.</p>
<p>As for executing actions, the Aryan you probably has uses our action hijacking system.<br>
Normally in RuneScape, when you click a button, or attack a monster, the following details are set:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Action ID[/li]<br>
[li]Action Name (Attack - Lah, e.g)[/li]<br>
[li]Action Parameters (A list of relevant arguments, for example, the (x,y), or perhaps the NPC id?)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Somewhere during the RuneScape loop, the code interprets these details, and sends the appropriate packet.<br>
This is how RuneScape and actions work.</p>
<p>Now, we add Aryan. This setting of details is the result of an input event, for example, the click of a mouse or a press of a button.<br>
What Aryan does is, create an input event (usually a move &amp; click), to the correct location where possible.<br>
Now, if this was all we did, we would have SCAR…<br>
What happens next is, right before the method that interprets set details is processed, we HIJACK this method, and insert our own little code replacing the details with the correct once.</p>
<p>Hence, we have an action, and is still proven undetectable (not the bot, the way of hijacking an action).<br>
So, we might click for example, and get the following details:</p>
<p>[ul][li]100 - “Walk Here”, 432432423[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>but we can replace it with</p>
<p>[ul][li]120 - “Attack”, 10[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The action is still fired from an input event, and everything works out just dandy.</p>
<p>As for your SBoT question, I am not aware of their current system. I know they used to action force (DIRECTLY INVOKE the action processing method, and used this system at one time)</p>

              <p>I’ll give you my quick nooby answer. Its a java bot that sends commands to the server and interprets information from the server. Problem is that its nothing humanlike, I do believe SBOT3 is somewhat the same cept with less detectability</p>

              <p>curious as to what exactly is aryan. is it basically just a client hack that injects code into certain mem addresses, or is it something more? is someone out there can tell me exactly what it is, besides just a “leet ass bot” as others have put it. Also, whats sbot, does it work in the same way.</p>
