    <title>The only thread to look at for me. connectivity issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-only-thread-to-look-at-for-me-connectivity-issue/509868</link>
    <description>I know I have a few threads here but all of those problems have been dealt with.

My last and final issue is connectivity.  I&#39;ve gotten everything to run and start up t and I am able to connect and log in if the IP&#39;s in the gui and client are set to 127.0.0.1.  Once I change them to my no-ip, I cannot log in anymore (and therefore neither can anyone else).  Here are a few things to note

1) I AM USING A VIRTUAL MACHINE (VMbox - running windows 7.  The host computer is a Mac)
2) My firewall on the VM is OFF.
3) I HAVE a no-ip set up and a no-ip.duc (not sure if the info is correct)
4) I have &quot;tried&quot; to portforward (not sure if the info is correct)

This is most certainly a port forwarding issue, I would think...  Can I not port forward correctly on a VM?

This is getting very frustrating.  I hope someone can help me.  
Thanks</description>
