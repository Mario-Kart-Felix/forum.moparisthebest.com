    <title>Help with adding my own updates to the server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-adding-my-own-updates-to-the-server/217433</link>
    <description>    Ok, I have been changing simple things in Client.java sutch as changing the name of the owners and so on, but when I save it, It is not added to my server. I have had the same problem on all the sources I use, which have I got from the download section here. I change things sutch as names, and commands, and when I am done, I make sure I save, but when I am on my server, nothing is changed. 
    I&#39;m not sure if I missed something in the tutorials, or I just made some nooby mistake, but any helpful advice would be much appreciated.</description>
