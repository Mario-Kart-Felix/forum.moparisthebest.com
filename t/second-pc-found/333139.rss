<p>Lol I know well, the socket 775 lasted a bit don’t you think. But those 1366 processors soon became 1156 processors. Is intel going to make any more 1366 socket processors? Edit I see they have, but what do they plan on doing longer 1366 or 1156?[/quote]</p>
<p>The 1366 is supposed to be the higher end platform, with the 1156 being the mainstream. They still make 1366 processors, infact they released a brand new one last week - the i7 980x - the 6 core,  12 threaded desktop processor. Then a month or so ago, they released the 930.</p>

Don’t get the X4 because they cheapen the cables by using cable netting instead of using black coated wiring which looks fucking great. They are the only one who use modular 24 pin adapters.</p>

<p>Exactly typical PC’s you get like 1 year I believe. Most of the parts that you buy separate are about 2 - 3 years. So if something fucks up in that time frame you are covered. Also I agree with thuglife, picking out the parts for a PC takes awhile for me also. I like looking at scores and benchmark tests on different games. I like picking out the best motherboard that will allow me to upgrade to a better processor in the future if I feel like it, and I also like picking out the motherboard with the best and most features. Recently as I stated I built a computer for my grandparents thought they didn’t need all of this stuff I knew it was the best deal so I got it the motherboard had (hidef audio, 1gb/sec ethernet, one of the few pre i3,i5,i7 motherboards that supported ddr3, and built in hi-def video with hdmi/dvi out incase I decided not to go with a video card. Also when I got the case I spent about 10 non-stop hours cutting holes and painting the case with my father for the best cable management you will see. See below for a picture.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i41.tinypic.com/10elaf8.jpg" title="10elaf8.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/10elaf8.jpg" alt width="666" height="500"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>Also for the record. I’ve built about five pc’s. One for my family first, then myself, then my dad’s friend, then my dad, and then for my grandparents christmas present. THe first one I ever did I reused a processor, ram, and harddrive. I bought a motherboard, cd drive, case, and now it has a replaced CPU. I pretty much did all of that without any research but it turned out to be a good choice. I knew nothing when I first started and everything worked out perfect. I actually bought a 1.6GHZ CPU and I got that over clocked to 2.8…I’d say that is pretty decent. The computer runs all the games I want perfectly, and it is currently used as a hackintosh. (10.5.8). I also spend time finding the best parts that are almost 100% compatiable with a vanilla osx install. This save’s alot of money vs buying a mac and you have the option of switching between osx, windows, and linux for about 700 dollars. Thats with many extra features. I know a mac mini costs $600 dollars but you dont get 4gb, 500gb harddrive, a fast processor, or a good videocard.</p>

<p>I doubt you will notice the difference. If you make it your self you insure quality by putting it together slowly, organizing your wires, inserting parts so they fit snug, and making sure that the thermal compound is applied properly. All of this insures that your computer will be more reliable. Plus you learn more about computers when you take the time to research each part, including the reliability, quietness, and performance. You can also find the best deals this way. You also save alot of money.  I built a computer for my grandparents this christmas dual core 3ghz, gts250, onboard hd video and sound, 4gb of ddr3, 500gb harddrive, and cd/dvd drive. I made sure this was all quality before I bought it, took about 2 weeks and this computer runs great. Guess what! only about $550 excluding Windows 7. Thats about 400 euros, or 358 pounds. This computer ran anything I threw at it (gamewise) at 1680X1050 on a hd monitor. That includes Crysis, GTA4, CODMW, and CODMW2.</p>

<p>hah, for me putting it together myself pretty much insures the quality is going to be crap</p>
<p>id much rather trust an automated process, robot or whatever it might be that puts together a computer with a system designed by a professional engineer than myself. i suppose you can buy better quality parts than would be in a prebuilt computer, but at least if you buy one prebuilt you know its going to work 100%, the psu wont be insufficient, your components wont be incompatible</p>

<p>im on a budget of around £500 inc. 22" screen, i found this one which i think is alright</p>

<p>i know its not the i6 or 7 or anything like that but im only a starter gamer?<br>
does it look good, its only ddr2 also :\</p>
<p>Thanks[/quote]I haven’t checked it out, but i can tell you this: i7 is a future investment, definately not required to play the latest games maxed out etc. DDR2 is not a problem either.</p>
<p>I am on an Amd Phenom 2 x4 920 (2.8ghz quad) and 8gb ddr2 ram, 1066mhz (and a geforce gtx 275 oc). I can max any game out with no problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>On that budget you’ll be able to build a good rig</p>
