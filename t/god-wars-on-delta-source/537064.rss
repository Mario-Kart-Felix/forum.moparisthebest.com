    <title>God wars on delta source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/god-wars-on-delta-source/537064</link>
    <description>I am new to coding and i started with the original delta and im trying to slowing learn and work my way up. but right now i am stuck trying to get rid of the bandos in the stupid Desert treasure dung. and get him into the actual gwd dung.. i been looking all over mopar, runeserver, and google and what i have found so far is that supposibly the gwd dung was not in 317 sources so i was hoping some one would correct me and tell me the coords for it (i hope im wrong cause it would be easier that way) and if that is correct then i&#39;d like to know is it possible to add the gwd dung map into 317 delta source? also the link to a tutorial would be just great if anyone knows of one(:
-thanks guys
