    <title>Where are the dreams?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-are-the-dreams/550401</link>
    <description>I quited rsps but now what I don&#39;t know is why people are still making RuneScape Private Servers,You might wanna tell me that gtfo or something else but I wont argure I loved coding rsps but I think people should have quited coding since ever,I mean no one should have coded.Ikov is good they are getting better(1000 players daily) soulsplit is gone they had 2000 players daily but after Ikov and emps-scape&#39;s relaunching they lost over 1200 players!
Does anyone think that they can top RuneScape?
Why do people still code I know its fun but what is the point of that and I think everyone should go out and get a life lucky for me I&#39;m still 13 I have a life and I&#39;m not gonna ruin that. well tell me why do people still code?</description>

<p>I’m not sure whether to blast you for being so ignorant or to let it slide because you’re 13 and wouldn’t know any better (or a troll). Get a life? Most of the core members have decent enough lives. We’ve spent time here because we enjoy learning or have known each other for almost a decade. Hell, some of us even study computer science or work in software development so we don’t mind the little projects.</p>
<p>We write things because we enjoy the challenge. We enjoy people using something that we’ve created. None of us cares about ‘topping Runescape’ and it hasn’t been the goal. An artist doesn’t paint so they can beat another artist. It’s a form of artistic expression.<br>
If that’s a waste, then I’ve happily wasted my time.</p>

              <p>This is borderline unbearably unreadable but I got the premise of “why do people still code?” A lot of people do it for learning purposes, smaller projects; I can’t think of anyone who creates an RSPS with the intentions of “Topping Runescape,” as you put it. It’s a matter of taking pride in something you created, even if the intention to go public isn’t there. I work on my own miscellaneous projects that no one will ever know about just for the sake of doing something.</p>
