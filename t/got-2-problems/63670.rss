    <description>[b]Problem #1. [/b] 

On my server, I used Ultimate Pk scape as my base. Well, everytime somone dies, and the pker is still standing outside. The person he killed would be outside, yet he would still appear that he is INSIDE the bank.

To make it simpler..  here is an example.

Person A and Person B

Person A and B are both standing outsde the varrock bank, Person A kills Person B.  Person B re-spwns inside the bank, and Person A is still outside.  Person B walks outside, but to Person A it would still look like Person B is in the bank.

I don&#39;t know but that might have made it simpler.

That right there would be a bad stitution for a PK server to be in. People would be getting killed massivly without even knowing it. 

[b]Problem #2[/b] 

EDIT: Ok here is my main problem, I figured out that my server was down. To other people.. 
For me it still lets me get on ok.

Anyone know what I might have done wrong? My firewalls are all dissabled.</description>
