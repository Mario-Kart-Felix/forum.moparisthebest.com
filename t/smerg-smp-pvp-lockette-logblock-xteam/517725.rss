Smerg is a relatively new server stuffed with experience and opportunity. We may be a newer server, but we know what you want. 

[Survival] - [PvP] - Nether - Fun!

We&#39;re proud to say that the direction of the server is organic to its players. Utilizing a variety of plugins, we strive to provide as many avenues of fun as possible. We&#39;ll customize our little corner of the Minecraft universe as our players see fit, using plugins like Multiverse, Lockette, WorldGuard, LogBlock, CombatTag, and so on.

As an initial public theme, our current map features The Wall, a magical border between vastly different worlds!

On the South side of the wall, where players spawn, the world is relatively safe, normal, just as we&#39;re used to. Players can lock their chests and doors and have their builds protected from griefing with powerful tools like LogBlock. By all means, players must still survive the night, but creativity is valued.

In the North, however, things are very different. Mobs are more bloodthirsty, the sound of TnT rocks the night, and teams of players have been known to hunt eachother for fun. The North is a difficult land which knows no master. Will you be the one to rule it?</description>
