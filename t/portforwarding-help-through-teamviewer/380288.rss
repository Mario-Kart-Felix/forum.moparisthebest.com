    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-help-through-teamviewer/380288</link>
    <description>Hello, I have been trying to portforward with my D-Link DSL - 2640B and I haven&#39;t had any luck. I have tried portforward.com and the pictures and everything in their little tutorial are completely different from how my router is set up. it is a router/modem in one. Please reply if you think you can help, my msn is kyleheim@hotmail.com if you would like to add me and try to help, thank you very much.</description>
