    <description>Tip # 1: ALWAYS Lock Your Chests This is a huge problem i see on the server people logging on with all there items stolen Crying to us about it. But do you no who&#39;s fault it really is YOURS Because you did not lock your chests This is huge no matter how fare away your house is ALWAYS Lock your chests. This is the same for furnaces if your going to let someone use your furnace put a password on and never leave your coal in it.
If you are unsure how to do this read over this thread:http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,473012.0.html

Tip # 2:Building closer to the spawn may seem nice every one can look at your huge house And adore it.But really building close to the spawn probably increases your chances of getting griefed ten fold You always want to build as far from the spawn as possible the farther away the less chances of you getting griefed

Tip # 3: Building Above ground is a nice way to show your house but its also a nice way to get griefed if you build under ground or make your house have some sort of secret entrance people wont even be able to see it or be able to get in now of coarse with the secret entrance if they really wanted to grief you they would just break through. saying this its just better to build under ground

Tip # 4: it migh be a good idea to build your (main) base at the bottom of the map
this way you migh even get diamond and you&#39;re house is very hard to accidentally get in

Tip # 5: do not put valuable materials in sight, this way the griefers will have less reason to pick your house
if you have a block of diamond or obsidian in sight you will get griefed

Tip # 6: hide you&#39;re door with something that&#39;s in the area so it does&#39;nt look suspicious (like sand on top of a mountain)

Tip # 7: You can put some airlocks to protect your base agains flooding by water


I will be adding more tips to this list as i think of more if you have any suggestions feel free to post them here

              <p>Tip # 1: ALWAYS Lock Your Chests This is a huge problem i see on the server people logging on with all there items stolen Crying to us about it. But do you no who’s fault it really is YOURS Because you did not lock your chests This is huge no matter how fare away your house is ALWAYS Lock your chests. This is the same for furnaces if your going to let someone use your furnace put a password on and never leave your coal in it.<br>
If you are unsure how to do this read over this thread:<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,473012.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,473012.0.html</a></p>
<p>Tip # 2:Building closer to the spawn may seem nice every one can look at your huge house And adore it.But really building close to the spawn probably increases your chances of getting griefed ten fold You always want to build as far from the spawn as possible the farther away the less chances of you getting griefed</p>
<p>Tip # 3: Building Above ground is a nice way to show your house but its also a nice way to get griefed if you build under ground or make your house have some sort of secret entrance people wont even be able to see it or be able to get in now of coarse with the secret entrance if they really wanted to grief you they would just break through. saying this its just better to build under ground</p>
<p>Tip # 4: it migh be a good idea to build your (main) base at the bottom of the map<br>
this way you migh even get diamond and you’re house is very hard to accidentally get in</p>
<p>Tip # 5: do not put valuable materials in sight, this way the griefers will have less reason to pick your house<br>
if you have a block of diamond or obsidian in sight you will get griefed</p>
<p>Tip # 6: hide you’re door with something that’s in the area so it does’nt look suspicious (like sand on top of a mountain)</p>
<p>Tip # 7: You can put some airlocks to protect your base agains flooding by water</p>
<p>I will be adding more tips to this list as i think of more if you have any suggestions feel free to post them here</p>
