    <description>Ok, I am just making little updates that will make my server good to great. I&#39;ve added most of the little things that a server would need im just kind of touching up on things. But would anyone possibly know how to change the max money of a server? like say you can only get up to 2000m how would I make that to be higher say like 3000m? Thanks if you can help</description>
