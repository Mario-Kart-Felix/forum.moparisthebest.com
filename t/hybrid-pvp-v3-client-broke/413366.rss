    <title>Hybrid pvp v3 client Broke</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hybrid-pvp-v3-client-broke/413366</link>
    <description>I had a hybrid pvp v3 client with a working cache what downloaded automaticly from a website but now for a few weeks i 
have had alot of people complaining about the cache not working so i thought i would have a look myself so i logged onto my other computer and tried to download my own cache and people was right , The Link is now broken from the original hybrid pvp v3 server so now no one can get onto my server im wondering if anyone is able to give me a client with a cache inside? Or a PI client with a working cache link inside what will fit my server please? It would realy help alot if you can help please could u either reply to this post or add my msn?
