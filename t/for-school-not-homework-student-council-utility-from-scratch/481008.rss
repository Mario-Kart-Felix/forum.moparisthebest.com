    <title>[For school, not homework] Student Council Utility [From scratch]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/for-school-not-homework-student-council-utility-from-scratch/481008</link>
    <description>[center][IMG]http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/9636/studentcouncilutilitylo.png[/img][/center]

Well, since I am part of the student council in my school, I decided to make this &#39;utility&#39; for updates of the student council. Thing is, I wanna be &#39;unique&#39; and make a server to client connection, so I gotta learn networking. That&#39;s the challenge. This is fully for my education, and I&#39;m going to try my best to make it happen. Once I learn networking, I could do much more on RSPS than I previously could.

[b]Networking Choice: NIO [i](Not IO, Netty, or MINA)[/i][/b]

Why? Because I find NIO to be the perfect choice for me to do more in RSPS. I&#39;m going to make this open source. Why? Because I&#39;d like [b]YOU[/b] guys to give me advice. I&#39;m very non-native to networking, so maybe you guys could guide me to the right step.

[b]SCU - Student Council Utility: https://github.com/Arham4/SCU[/b]

You guys maybe are thinking,
[quote=&quot;You&quot;]Wow, school thing in mopar.[/quote]
But in all honesty, I don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t want to do this for the school, I want to do this for my own benefit of learning the basics of networking. So please, constructive criticism and advice surely is appreciated.

<p>It’s not really a good or bad habit, it’s just a different workflow. Some projects are developed like this (Rails and Netty are two that I keep an eye on that are like this), others use the workflow of keeping master stable and then doing all development in feature branches.</p>

<p>Well, since I am part of the student council in my school, I decided to make this ‘utility’ for updates of the student council. Thing is, I wanna be ‘unique’ and make a server to client connection, so I gotta learn networking. That’s the challenge. This is fully for my education, and I’m going to try my best to make it happen. Once I learn networking, I could do much more on RSPS than I previously could.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Networking Choice: NIO <span class="bbcode-i">(Not IO, Netty, or MINA)</span></span></p>
<p>Why? Because I find NIO to be the perfect choice for me to do more in RSPS. I’m going to make this open source. Why? Because I’d like <span class="bbcode-b">YOU</span> guys to give me advice. I’m very non-native to networking, so maybe you guys could guide me to the right step.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">SCU - Student Council Utility: <a href="https://github.com/Arham4/SCU" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Arham4/SCU</a></span></p>
<p>You guys maybe are thinking,</p>
<aside class="quote">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 You:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow, school thing in mopar.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>But in all honesty, I don’t care. I don’t want to do this for the school, I want to do this for my own benefit of learning the basics of networking. So please, constructive criticism and advice surely is appreciated.</p>
