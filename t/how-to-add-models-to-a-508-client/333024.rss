    <title>How to add models to a 508 client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-models-to-a-508-client/333024</link>
    <description>Hey guys. 
I just started working on a 508 server and client. No problems so far, other than the fact that I am unable to add models. 

The first problem is that I don&#39;t seem to have a &#39;Models&#39; folder. Is there a specific place for this to be in the 508 client files? If so, where? If not, is it possible for me to add one? If so, how?

The second problem is the integers. Not that I have attempted anything with them yet. 

The third problem is the command for adding models in game. I remember that for 317&#39;s you just had to go ingame and say &quot;add model ####&quot;. But, I&#39;m not sure if it is the same on 508&#39;s. 

If you can answer all my question, I would very much appreciate it. Or, if you have a link to a tutorial that fully covers adding models to a 508 client, I&#39;d appreciate that, as well. 
I have used the search bar and looked all over google for one. But I can&#39;t seem to find any that covers &#39;everything&#39;. 

Thanks a lot.
