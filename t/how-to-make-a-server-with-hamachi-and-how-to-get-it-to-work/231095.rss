    <description>Well alot of people have been having trouble with getting hamachi so heres the actual guide for windows.

First open up an web-browser google perferably, and search &quot;Hamachi&quot;
Click the first link, and if your still having troubles heres a picture.

You will then be on a site called &quot;LogMeIn,&quot; look for the windows platform download, pick your language and click download.

If your half retarted heres a picture....

Once you have Hamachi downloaded a client should appear, click the power button to turn hamachi on. Either if your creating a network or joining one click the little triangle thingy to pick an option. Heres a picture if your a retard....

--------&gt;[IMG]http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm315/xlubedx/hamachi3.jpg[/img]


If your creating a network, just click create a new network or w/e think of a name and password and walla, you have your hamachi server and you must have your source running. You will have to use your hamachi ip which can be found at the very top of your hamachi client or if you click start, then run, then type cmd, then type ipconfig to find it out.

If your joining a network just simply use an existing network name and password to join it, then look at the owners nickname for hamachi, then look for his ip, and use that ip to log into his server, unless he tells you it somewhere else. Heres a picture of joining my server....

Network name - ghostpker (this is the new one dont use ghostpkz)
Password - 123 (same as always)

Once your done that your hamachi ip will be at the very top of your client and there your done, how easy is that? Heres a final picture if your a fucking blind cunt....
