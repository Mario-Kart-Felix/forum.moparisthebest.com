    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hybrid-pvpv2-weblient-need-help/404939</link>
    <description>I have recently downloaded the hybrid pvp v2 source and client. i have had the server up and i want to make a webclient. however im stuck on a huge problem. i zipped my cache and sprites and its 53.5mb. kind of large. i can upload this to x10hosting. i would like to but my client on my webs.com site though. the worst problem is i created my jar and it is 91.5mb!!! i can not find a free host that will hold a upload file that big. if you have any tips or reccomendations it would be greatly apreciated. you can email me at willryang@hotmail.com or msn me. i also have teamviewer so that would help alot to. i really look forward to getting a webclient up but as of now im not sure.</description>
