    <description>[center][size=18pt]Team Alpha. Benefiting you.[/size][/center]
[u][b]
What is Team Alpha?[/b][/u]
Team Alpha is a team of experienced programmers looking to make many improvements and fixes to winterLove. Any base that&#39;s winterLove derived (such as PI and Delta) will be benefited by Team Alpha.

[u][b]
So who&#39;s in Team Alpha?[/b][/u]
&gt;Clawz fury, a very respected member of this community and a good friend who is very capable of rewriting content for winterLove and fulfill many operations required by TA. His dedication will drive the team forward, and his knowledge in Java will improve game code throughout servers.

&gt;Arham 4, another respected member of this community and again a good friend. Arham shows dedication and a good understanding of Java and winterLove, and will be very beneficial to TA and will help to produce code for wL servers.

&gt;the elve age, moderator of MSCP forums and a good friend. Caleb shows a deep understanding of the 317 client and protocol and will be able to help the other programmers in TA with his knowledge.

&gt;Myself, Christmas_tree. What you see is what you get.

[u][b]When should we start to see content?[/b][/u]
Due to IRL commitments such as exams and school, TA will be a gradual process. We expect to be producing code at a steady rate, and code will be written in a tutorial format for users to implement straight into their servers. You should start to see tutorials released within 6-8 weeks.

[u][b]What sort of code can we expect?[/b][/u]
Minor yet unreleased content such as player and NPC clipping shall be released at some point, but TA would like to concentrate on fixing some of the bigger issues within winterLove, such as player and NPC  updating, the login block and packet handling. These are just a few of the things you can expect. We have a list to work through.

[u][b]Can i join?[/b][/u]
Drop me a personal message and i may consider you for the team.</description>

Looks cool, good luck. I will follow.<br>

<ul>
<li>1 question<br>
Why do yous want to help fix wL? Like personally I don’t see a gain in anyway for you. I’m just curious, I’m not saying don’t do it ofc cause that’d suck if yous didn’t continue![/quote]</li>
</ul>
<p>Good question. I guess to us personally there is no gain. But you have to look at what’s best for the community sometimes over what’s best for you as an individual. Releasing fixes will benefit everyone. And what comes around goes around.</p>
<p>Lets face it guys, we’re not moving away from winterLove anytime soon, so we have to make do best with what we’ve got and we’re trying to make that a little better than what it was before.</p>
