Hello, i won&#39;t take a lot of your time making you read this thread but I would like you to represent a 317 private server, which was released not too long ago, I would say about 2 weeks. Don&#39;t get us wrong, our name doesn&#39;t not say that our server is spawn, and its based on pvp. No, this server has good economy, all of your cash earned from mobs count&#39;s. You won&#39;t achieve all of your stats to maxed very fast and I can promise you, it won&#39;t be easy. Well about server?  Our server has unique home I would say, it is Slayer Tower. 

Some information about our server :

- Fun PK
- Dice bag
- Our forum based on Invision power board
- All levels working
- Cursor prayers!
- A lot of updates!
- Active community
- Leveling up is not easy!
- Completionist / Max capes
- Different game settings options.
- Good amount of minigames
- 100+ Working achievements.
- Crystal keys and chests.
- Mystery and legendary mystery boxes.
- Unique spot for pvp - PK BOX
- Owner is making server by players opinions and suggestions.
- Korasi sword with fully working damage and special attack.
- More than 10 working bosses, including nex and nomad.
- Perfect economy.
- And much more...
