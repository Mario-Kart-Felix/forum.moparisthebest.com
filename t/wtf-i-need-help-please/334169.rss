    <description>Ok, i am trying to host my server at my friends house, he has the exact same router, and my no-ip up. i did everything at my house right, and it worked, but when i try it at his house, it doesnt work. i followed this guide http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html so if you need to know what i did it&#39;s there. i also have the same router as the pictures on there so it was wayy easier. ok, so how do i fix it, or can i or what...? please respond. Thanks</description>
