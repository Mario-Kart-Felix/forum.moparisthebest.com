<p>I think it was a typo for muling, where you store your valuable items on a separate account and just transfer them over to your main account when you need them. That way, if you die you still have backup items.</p>

<p>You have some interesting “features” list, I must admit. I’m a strong believer that in some people, their age doesn’t matter and the maturity of that person can very well be different from that of a 21 year old (for example), and even a little more mature than that 21 year old. It shouldn’t be apart of your feature list, that’s a little ridiculous.</p>
<p>And as far as fighting and trading yourself, are you talking about mutli-logging? I’m assuming that’s what, “muiling” means because I’ve never heard of such a word; could be wrong on that one.</p>
<p>Anyway, a little bit of media and an more interesting feature list would do this thread some good. Good luck with the server!</p>
