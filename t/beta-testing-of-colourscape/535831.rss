    <description>Hello people of Moparscape. I am here today to introduce you to Colourscape!

What is colourscape? Colourscape is a new rsps, that is currently in Beta, however i need some players to help me test things, so this is why im releasing it.

Home - The home is custom and contains lots of different things to do. [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/7mUIDBK.png[/img]

Stats - This is a picture of all stats, levelling is slow, making 99&#39;s rare.

Teleports/Portals - 3 of the safe portals, leading to skills, slayer and whole loads of places.

Teleports/Portals - 3 of the dangerous portals, leading to bosses which hit hard.

Godwars interface with teleport and full on custom zones, with amazing drops.

All skills working 100% (come test for yourself).

Perfect economy and skilling (although only 5 players).

Register on our forums @ www.colourscape.boards.net and get the client whilst you&#39;re there.

So much more, kinda short for time will edit this tomorrow. Hope you guys come and give colourscape a try! 

Thanks, Main Owner Purple.</description>
