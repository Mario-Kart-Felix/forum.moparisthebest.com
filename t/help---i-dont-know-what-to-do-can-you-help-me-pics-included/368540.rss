<p>Your users, and ONLY your users connect with your IP address or No-Ip.</p>
<p>Anyone who is on your internet connection and wants to play (Your sibling, friend, etc.) will have to use your IPV4 address.</p>
<p>To mostly all of this info besides localhost(127.0.0.1 which I gave you), use the command “ipconfig” in your CMD(Command Prompt) without quotation marks (" ").</p>
<p>To get your IP address easily, visit <a href="http://whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://whatismyip.com</a></p>
<p>Hope I helped.</p>
