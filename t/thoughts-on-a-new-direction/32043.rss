    <title>Thoughts on a new direction?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thoughts-on-a-new-direction/32043</link>
    <description>Some of you may have heard about this already, but i&#39;ll post what I already did on some other sites:

I have only just began looking into RS Server development... but comming from a background in coding (9 years worth) I&#39;ve already seen that with the huge amounts of unorganized codes that are being put out, the servers have become somewhat... sloppy. The code itself is unnecessarily hard to follow.

I&#39;ve been working for the past 2 days on a server code in C++ and have already got it working somewhat. The client and server exchange RSA keys, reads the login packet and checks the password. That&#39;s as far as I&#39;ve gotten... but my plans are to make the server base engine, then release the APIs for making extensions. This way one could make extensions for it that they could load themselves in Perl, C, C++, or whatever (somewhat like Gaim).

I feel that this would provide an overall more stable server setup, since the base code would be rarely modified. What do you guys thing? Should I persue this further or would no one use it?

I am doing it in wxWidgets so the GUI and socket base would be portable from Linux to Windows and Mac.

And here&#39;s a screen shot if the progress: (Yes, I was running this on ReactOS to make sure the socket code was portable when I decided to screen shot this)

              <p>You see, the server only handles incomming and outgoing packets. I’ve followed the entire connection stream and had it working already. The rest is just telling the client what to display… it has all of the information. So i won’t have to rewrite anything… The client will remain in java (unless someone is brave enough to attempt that… or use GCC’s java compiler to make it into an exe… but that’s rather buggy).</p>
<p>My goal is to have a decient working version within the month <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Definatly persue this because C++ R0({$ and Java suc{$ because of limitations. People would use this just out of ease of an executable and not needing the JDK just to play the servers. I am not sure if it is possible considering all of the Deobs are all in Java and the main connection between a private server and the client is use Java, you would have to rewrite basicly everything. Good-luck with it!</p>
