    <title>Send to all?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/send-to-all/299574</link>
    <description>hey, im not very good at coding but i&#39;m giving it a try.
i tried to make a send to all message that somebody has just logged in, from what i see looking through the files this looks like what would be the logic thing to do.
[code]		getOwner().getActionSender().sendtoall(getOwner(), &quot;p.username Has just signed in!&quot;);[/code]
but i get errors with that.
this is the error;
[code]Compiling all files....
.\net\com\espeon\test\TestWorldLoader.java:35: cannot find symbol
symbol  : method SendToAll(net.com.espeon.model.Player,java.lang.String)
location: class net.com.espeon.io.ActionSender
                getOwner().getActionSender().SendToAll(getOwner(), &quot;p.username H
as just signed in!&quot;);
                                            ^
Note: .\net\com\espeon\net\SocketListener.java uses unchecked or unsafe operatio
ns.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
1 error
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]
i have tried to find one everywhere, and i did give it a go, i just need help on getting the right thing to put.
as you can probably see i don&#39;t really know anything about coding and i&#39;m trying my best.

I have been looking everywhere on how to change home on espeon source could you please post a TUT for me or something?

thanks in advance,

<p>Try that[/quote]<br>
this isnt for a command, it is for when sombody loggs in it sends to the whole server that he has just logged in</p>
