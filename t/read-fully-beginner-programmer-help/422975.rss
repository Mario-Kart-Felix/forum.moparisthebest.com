    <description>Hey guys, well im a beginner programmer, and ive been at learning java for the past month and a half from this guy on youtube. This is his first video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl-zzrqQoSE (Im on number 44, so im really not that experienced) and i really understand how programming works. Its just remembering how to code things that i have trouble with. I understand the concept, and understand what ide have to do to get this certain thign to work, its  just i cant code it out, since im not that experienced. What i would like, is to join a dev team, as a coder and help out, and code minor stuff. I would probably need an experienced person to help me, but after 1-2months ill definately be somewhat competent, so i can right good code by myself.(Ive tried working on my own source and client, but i cant port forward because my isp wont let me)
TY in advance, and also wasnt sure where to put this.</description>
