    <title>Adding Colored Whips. Lime..Lava..Pink. Help Plz!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-colored-whips-lime-lava-pink-help-plz/439391</link>
    <description>OK so im using hybrid pvp and i added the stuff to make a lime whip. everything is absolutely perfect except for the color. In many tutorials they use this to change the items color. 
itemDef.modifiedModelColors[0] = 17350;
itemDef.originalModelColors[0] = 528;
and also
itemDef.modifiedModelColors = new int[1];
itemDef.originalModelColors = new int[1];

the problem is mine is completely different. here are my only codes even close to that.

editedModelColor = null;
newModelColor = null;
and also
editedModelColor = itemDef.editedModelColor;
newModelColor = itemDef.newModelColor;
and also...
public int[] editedModelColor;
public int[] newModelColor;

One of my friends told me that hybrid pvp doesnt support the type of code that changed an items color when there is no model. I was wondering if there is a way to change the items color withought the model id&#39;s with the code i use.
and i cant use models becasue there arent any.. the model id for every colored whip i have seen code for is 5412. and then they just change it&#39;s color with the code. (which i cant do)
if someone could do thsi for me i am willing to pay $10 !!! thats huge.. via paypal.
skype me for the job! and leave a message in this forum. my skype is rhssoccer4.
thanks so much! please help!</description>
