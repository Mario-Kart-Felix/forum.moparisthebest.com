    <description>Ok so i&#39;m trying to get my friend onto my server and i portwarded and made no-ip and all that stuff but when i put in the source what the client is supposed to connect to which i think is:
		/**
		 * Initialise Handlers
		 */
		//VoteForCash.createConnection();
		EventManager.initialize();
		Connection.initialize();
		//PlayerSaving.initialize();
		//MysqlManager.createConnection();
		
		/**
		 * Clipped Following (NPC)
		 */
		
		/**
		 * Server Successfully Loaded 
		 */
		System.out.println(&quot;Server listening on port basedworld.no-ip.org:&quot; + serverlistenerPort);
		/**
		 * Main Server Tick
		 */
		try {

It doesn&#39;t work like i save it and compile and all that but nothing actually happens when i click &#39;run-server&#39; the server itself is that &#39;Team Torva&#39; and me and my friend are starting to think you just can&#39;t use that server.. Can anyone please help? I don&#39;t understand this at all &gt;.&lt;</description>
