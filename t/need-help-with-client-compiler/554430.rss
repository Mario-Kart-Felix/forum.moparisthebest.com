    <title>Need help with Client compiler</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-client-compiler/554430</link>
    <description>hey everyone, i know this is a noob question. but I have tried so many compiler codes and none of them work. and all I need is a compiler so I can compile a client so it&#39;ll update the class files. can anyone help me? this is what I get everytime i go to compile.

[code]&#39;&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_66\bin&quot;&#39; is not recognized as an internal
 or external command,
operable program or batch file.
Press any key to continue . . .
[/code]

this is the compiler i have set up as of now.

[code]@echo off
title compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_66\bin&quot; *.java
pause[/code]

the whole C:\Program files (x86)\Java\jdk.1.8.0_66\bin&quot; is my path and it is set. that&#39;s why i don&#39;t understand why it isn&#39;t working. so close to chunking my computer out the window.</description>

              <p>You gave the compiler a directory. It’s expecting a command, such as an .exe to run.</p>
