    <title>How do I update/ Re install BIOS? (Computer Issue)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-update-re-install-bios-computer-issue/545445</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;ve had this inoperable computer sitting in my closet for the past year or so and the time has come to dust it off and use it once more. I am having an issue as to where, upon start up, the windows 7 login screen (The blue screen with the whatever design on it) appears but the login box, unfortunately, will not. I have reported this problem to Best Buy&#39;s Geek Squad although they want to charge me more than I paid for the laptop, as expected with a commercial brand computer company. I spoke with a nice lady on the phone who helped me to diagnose the problem as an error with my BIOS? I have no clue where to begin in repairing the aforementioned BIOS and so I figured some of the computer wizards within Moparscape could give me their diagnosis of the problem with a possible solution. Many thanks in advance!</description>

<p>I don’t see how it would be a BIOS problem. As suggested earlier, reload the OS. But before doing that, when the screen comes up try hitting CTRL + ALT + DEL + DEL</p>

              <p>To update your bios, you need to download the update, and you need to put it on a blank flash drive. Then turn off your computer and reboot it with the flash drive plugged in, somewhere in the bios setting you will see an update option. Then select the file from your flash drive and it should do the rest.</p>
<p>But, you can also try(long shot) put the windows installation disc in, and try to repair your OS.</p>
<p>Usually no harm can be done updating a bios, but I don’t recommend doing it. Before re-installing your OS try other things first.</p>
