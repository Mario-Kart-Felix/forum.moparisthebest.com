    <description>Hey there :)

I&#39;m having a bit of difficulty with a question involving the use of differentials, and would be grateful if someone could help. The question is as follows:

[i]In a breeder reactor, plutonium-239 is produced from uranium-238 at a constant rate, but it decays at a rate proportional to the amount of plutonium-239 present. The half-life of plutonium-239 is estimated as 24 000 years. If plutonium-239 is produced at a rate of 1 microgram per minute, solve the differential equation to find the amount present at any time after the reactor begins operation[/i]

So pretty much:
Plutonium-239 is produced at a rate of (1/1000000)g min[sup]-1[/sup]
It also has a half life of 24000 years (so in 24000 years, 1g of Plutonium-239 will decay to 0.5 g)

Thanks in advance for any help.

              <p>Heh, well its always fun to at least try these problems -  I just wish I could have been of more help.  Please let me know if you find out the proper solution from your teacher, as I’d certainly be interested in seeing it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Thanks for the effort - I’m fairly certain that if you can’t do it, almost no one else on these forums can.</p>

              <p>Hmm, a toughy indeed.  Well you can start with the general differential equation for radioactive decay:</p>
<p>dN/dt = -λN</p>
<p>Where N is the amount of of the radioactive substance, dN/dt is the number of decays per second, and λ is the decay constant (ln(2) / half life).  The general solution for this differential equation is pretty straight forward (N(t) = N[sub]o[/sub]e[sup]-λt[/sup]), but we need N[sub]o[/sub] to be a function of time, not just constant.</p>
<p>N[sub]o<a>/sub</a> = (6 x 10[sup]-7[/sup] g/s) * t<br>
(Note, I just converted your term a tad)</p>
<p>Forgive me if this is completely wrong…<br>
N(t) = N[sub]o<a>/sub</a>e[sup]-λt[/sup]</p>
<p>dN/dt = (6 x 10-7 g/s)e[sup]-λt[/sup] + ((6 x 10-7 g/s) * t)(-λe[sup]-λt[/sup])<br>
dN/dt = [(6 x 10-7 g/s)e[sup]-λt[/sup]] * (1 + -λt)<br>
dN/dt = (N/t) * (1 + -λt)</p>
<p>That’s as far as I can go with what I remember.  Its been a while since I’ve done differential equations, and I don’t remember anything like this - so chances are I’m completely off.  Typically I don’t post if I’m not really sure about my answer, but perhaps something I did might help.</p>
