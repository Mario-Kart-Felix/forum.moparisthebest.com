    <title>Another stupid &quot;Meaning of the song&quot; thread!</title>

    <description>Alright, so i&#39;m pretty sure sppt will understand the meaning of these lyrics.

I posted this to prove that Death Metal isn&#39;t what the majority of people&#39;s stereotype claims it to be. (and YES, you can actually hear what he sings in the songs, cause he&#39;s not &quot;grunting&quot;, he is using a technique of growl which is pretty clear compared to most bands)

The song is Death - In Human Form

[code]People of the earth beware,
It is here in human form
An atrocity laced with greed.
Filled with evil intentions.
Ready to attack
[Lead: Andy]

Look to the air for stories to choose,
Who will be your next victim
Profitting on visions of others,
dark emotions run through its veins
Its motives are false its mind is insane
A distant planet with no signs of life
To become a home for this alien breed.
Scientists of the world unite,
your services are more than needed
This creature in human form is out of control
[Lead: Chuck]

Looks can be deceiving, see beyond the shell
Flesh and eyes mean nothing.
The truth, time it will tell
Before you think you fool the world.
What comes around goes around.
Shown for what you are, a waste of life
[Lead: Andy][/code]

I am pretty much aware of what it&#39;s about, how about you?</description>

Politics, and to be more specific: america’s politics.<br>
And I’d have to agree with the lyrics &lt;3 chuck</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh woops lol but eh close enough it involved politics[/quote]Yes, as does most of their songs. It’s either about politics or religion. Here’s a another example which is about the greed and power of religion in america.</p>
<p>From the song “Crystal Mountain”:</p>
<p>[code]Built from blind faith<br>
Passed down from self-induced fantasy<br>
Turn a page to justify<br>
Conjuring power - it opens wide<br>
On your seventh day,<br>
is that how it’s done?<br>
Twisting your eyes to perceive<br>
all that you want<br>
To assume from ignorance<br>
Inflicting wounds with your<br>
cross-turned dagger</p>
<p>[Chorus:]<br>
Inside crystal mountain<br>
Evil takes its form<br>
Inside crystal mountain<br>
Commandments are reborn</p>
<p>All the traps are set to confine<br>
All who get in the way of the divine<br>
In sight and in mind of the hypocrite<br>
A slave to the curse forever confined</p>
<p>[Solo: Schuldiner]</p>
<p>Shatter the myth<br>
Don’t cut yourself<br>
On your words against<br>
dreams made of steel<br>
Stronger than any faith<br>
That inflicts pain and fear,<br>
is that how it’s done?<br>
Twisting your eyes to perceive<br>
all that you want<br>
To assume from ignorance<br>
Inflicting wounds with your<br>
cross-turned dagger[/code]</p>
