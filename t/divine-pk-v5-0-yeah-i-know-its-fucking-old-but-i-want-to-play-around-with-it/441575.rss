    <title>Divine pk v5.0. Yeah i know it&#39;s fucking old, but i want to play around with it</title>

    <description>I&#39;ve been messing around with this source because it was the first one i actually could get running considering i&#39;m a noob, tbh i thought i knew more. I personally think it&#39;s easier then EasyRsc, and it has it&#39;s own site etc. And i want to start somewhere.  

I have been playing around with it for the past idk like 2 hours or so and it&#39;s starting to piss me off how i edit NPCShops.xml and just change what the shopkeeper says just to test it and i log out and in and the cunt doesn&#39;t want to even talk to me. Then i try and compile it and what not and it still doesn&#39;t work. Tried extracting the xml file back to the RAR file. Tried closing the server down and re-opening. Then it fucks my wamp up and i have to redo the whole server and wamp and shit, i know it&#39;s probably cause i dunno whats goin on lol. can some1 plz help somehow let me know how to edit xml&#39;s without it erroring if you have any idea about this source. if not ill put it up if ur willing to help me fuck around with it abit. im bored and it actually looks decent. EasyRsc somewhat bugs me because it freezes and shit.

Edit: I have figured out i needed WinGzip which helped me to decompress &amp; compress files :D.
But the problem was when i check my task manager i find the java files are all open even when i close them there open in task manager still so when i update the server the address is bind. How do i fix this??? I have to go into my task manager and manually close them all before it updates my server.. wtf.?</description>
