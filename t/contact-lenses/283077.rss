    <description>I just got my trial pair, and when I&#39;m done with these I&#39;ll go back and pick up what I need for 6 months.  I&#39;m new to contacts, and had a hell of a time trying to get them in/out. 

Anyone have any tips for them or good/terrible experiences that they&#39;d like to share? :P</description>

<p>There a two types I know about, day lenses, and month lenses.<br>
Day lenses you just take on a new one every day and no cleaning, month lenses like 93dcthugs93 said.</p>

              <p>Very. All you do is take each lens one by one, and put it in your hand and squirt some of the cleaner on to it or whatever it’s called. Rub it around a little bit and you’re done.</p>
<p>When you take them out put them in their case and squirt the cleaner in there and leave them like that until you want to put them in again, and keep changing the cleaner every time.</p>

<p>What test did you do??<br>
I thought there was only one standard test? You must identify the number from an array of coloured dots.<br>
When I took it the “female” opticians could see a completly different number to me :s</p>

I can make out 22?[/quote]</p>
<p>I did the same optical test but it seemed fairly easier than that. Is there really a number in there because I cannot tell at all?</p>
<p>Anyway I have been wearing glasses for ages and I was wondering (on average) roughly how expensive contacts are. I’m in need for contacts as I do play quite a few sports such as Football (Soccer) + Cricket (You Americans may not know that one).</p>

<p>EDIT: And cuz I’m worrying I’ll put some dude off contacts now, even if it were possible, Streptococcus pyogenes and the other shit that causes TSS is everywhere anyway, so it’d be no more likely than the chance of you getting TSS from a cut or burn or w/e</p>

<p>The difference in pricing is big enough to make people say no to dailies and yes to monthlies.  Monthlies are designed better, and I’d imagine they are more durable.

And of course the final difference being that you discard dailies after each day, and monthlies after each month.  Either way, you aren’t supposed to sleep in them; if you tell your optometrist you did, they’d probably rage at you.</p>
<p>Just took them out after about 8 hours of wearing them; I found it pretty easy to do so.  Hopefully it’ll take me less time tomorrow then it did this morning. :P[/quote]<br>
You can get “Night &amp; Day” contacts that you can sleep in. I have them</p>

<p>What’s the difference between ‘dailies’ and ‘monthlies’? Are monthly contacts actually designed to be left in the eye while sleeping or something? Or is the real difference in pricing? It’d be great if someone could explain this.</p>

<p>The difference in pricing is big enough to make people say no to dailies and yes to monthlies.  Monthlies are designed better, and I’d imagine they are more durable.  And of course the final difference being that you discard dailies after each day, and monthlies after each month.  Either way, you aren’t supposed to sleep in them; if you tell your optometrist you did, they’d probably rage at you.</p>

<p>And stops you being a sniper :P, actually you can’t be a sniper even if you have laser eye surgery for some wierd reason.</p>
<p>Both of my eyes are short sighted so whenever I go outside with lenses on everything looks so crisp and sharp and it’s great. I’m glad I got lenses because glasses really aren’t my thing, aso lenses are great for playing sports because the only time they could come out are if you got hit in the eye by a fist or a football, whereas glasses can get broken and get dirty so you have to keep wiping them.</p>

<p>What’s the difference between ‘dailies’ and ‘monthlies’? Are monthly contacts actually designed to be left in the eye while sleeping or something? Or is the real difference in pricing? It’d be great if someone could explain this.[/quote]</p>
<p>I definitely suggest getting lenses as they are so convenient, also I get monthlys because for my left eye I need aspheric lenses which, because I have an uncommon stigmatism in my left eye, can only be prescribed monthly. I think dailys are better though if you can get them.</p>

<p>Had a little bit of trouble this morning, one of them kept moving on my eye, so I had to take it out and put it back in in the middle of class.  They’re pretty good now though.  I’ve noticed everything is sooo trippy; normally I don’t wear my glasses everywhere, but wearing contacts everywhere makes you see the world a whole new way. :P[/quote]<br>
It will be easier after a while, had that problem in the start as well. I have been using them for about 1 and a half year now I think, or even 2 years.</p>
<p>My prescription started at 1.5 I think, but it only got worse and worse and suddenly I’m on 5.75 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
