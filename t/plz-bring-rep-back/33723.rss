i asked when will it come back he said
      [quote=&quot;mod taharok&quot;]Well at first moparisthebest was saying he was planning on spliting rep from Moparisthebest.com with the rep from Moparscape.org. But then he disabled it from Moparscape.org and I am not sure if he is working on it anymore. I tried posting a new suggestion to keep rep, but to make people not spam it anymore. He was considering it but I do not think he will be using it =/.[/quote]
