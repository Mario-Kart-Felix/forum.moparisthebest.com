    <title>-NLVL VPS HOSTING IS HORRIBLE THEY GG&#39;D ME PLEASE READ- Updated</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nlvl-vps-hosting-is-horrible-they-ggd-me-please-read-updated/409656</link>
    <description>[i][b]So on the 14th of july, i had purchased a vps bronze package from nlvl.net.

He knows he messed up he tried offering me a 6gb vps package free for 6 months or a 50-100$ compensation...


Request: Send me my password.
Outcome: VPS Operating System Re-Installed And All of my Server Files Deleted.


Wtf....
I worked on this source offline for about 8 months all day, all night, 2-3 days straight sometimes.
I submit a password request, and they delete all my files, say they&#39;ll send me my password... forget to do it..

Everything was going fine than i released i was having all my players dc, there was major lagg, half the time i couldn&#39;t connect to the viewer.php to even connect to the vps itself.

So.. 
I submitted this ticket first:[/b][/i]
[code]Hi, i downloaded a virus attempting to get a gaming server running ended up deleting 2 user accounts on my computer and wiping out my files in attempt to clean up my pc and speed it up not knowing i didn&#39;t have the desktop file &quot;vps info&quot; i had copied out of the email you guys sent me with all the vps info.

Email is techaneena69@yahoo.com

Please, help ALSO!!!!!!!!!

MAYBE you guys can help me half the time i can&#39;t even connect to the vps..
Daily the server disconnects (whichs kicks all my players on my game offline = loose items = refund ON DONATIONS)
this is a on-going issue, all im running is a java.exe process.
Please help...
I feel like i got involved with a shitty vps here.[/code]

[i][b]Andrew V (NLVL STAFF) Replied:[/b][/i]
[code]Gabriel,

Your VPS is a bronze VPS with only 512MB RAM with CPU limitations, we highly suggest that you upgrade. Also I will have to escalate this ticket to technical staff for them to get your VNC details

Thanks,

Andrew V
Chief Marketing Officer &amp; General Support[/code]

[i][b]ALL he told me there was some details about my vps plan, and suggested that i should upgrade, he than followed up by saying&quot;I will escelate this ticket to get your VNC (VPS Connect) Details.

I replied with 2 more tickets:

First Ticket Submit:[/b][/i]
[code]Do you know how long this is going to take, at the moment i have alot of players attempting to connect.
Once my password is back ill go in and remove my services with you guys stop the funds, and than upgrade.
I now understand the lagg i had a computer our in spanaway with about 512mb ram i didn&#39;t know that i will upgrade soon!
In the meantime i need mah password.[/code]

[i][b]Second Ticket Submit:[/b][/i]
[code]Still waiting for a reply, ill submit more tickets, i don&#39;t think this should take more than a day to lookup my password.
Very urgent people are now leaving, asking about refunds.
Please bump this and give me my VPS viewer connect password as soon as possible.[/code]

[i][b]Simply implying that I WILL upgrade my vps if needed.
And please return me my password.
(long story short i lost it on my hard drive during a cleanup)[/b][/i]

Their next reply to my password request was:
(Now.. where in my speaches did i ask &quot;please re-install my vps operating system?&quot;)
[code]Gabriel,

Your VPS is currently being re-installed, I will have your account information emailed out to you within 30 mins - 1 hour.

Thanks,

Andrew V
Chief Marketing Officer &amp; General Support[/code]

[i][b]My reply to that was:[/b][/i]
[code]If i loose my files in the transition or what ever it is you&#39;re doing.
I&#39;m going to be pissed guys seriously, i don&#39;t know if it even involves than but im just mentioning it.[/code]


[i][b](NONE OF THIS IS EDITED ALL I DID WAS SIMPLY SPACE OUT THE MESSAGES AND REMOVE MY PERSONAL INFO)[/b][/i]
(sorry for the link tried submitting it on the post said a max of 2k characters..)
[url=http://elitedemons.org/nlvlchatscript.php]http://elitedemons.org/nlvlchatscript.php[/url]

Please read all this and tell me who is right in this situation, everywhere i&#39;m seeing nlvl is good, now im doing negative research ad finding out that they&#39;re not as professional as they appear, things don&#39;t work on their website, they respond totally off topic with out the info you asked for, all they do is copy and paste you their t.o.s
Please read.</description>

You’re the one to blame for not having backups. How much did you pay for the VPS to begin with? I suggest taking the refund they’re offering you and going out to buy some ice cream for yourself.</p>

So that means that your complaining to us that you were stupid enough to delete a user account storing data without a thought as to what it may contain and then expected customer service to fix it and bring it back while your paying for a 512MB vps that is probably $10 a month. I’m not intending to troll but it’s just rather silly to post something like this, its not the hosts fault.</p>

<p>He knows he messed up he tried offering me a 6gb vps package free for 6 months or a 50-100$ compensation…</p>

Outcome: VPS Operating System Re-Installed And All of my Server Files Deleted.</p>
<p>Wtf…<br>
I worked on this source offline for about 8 months all day, all night, 2-3 days straight sometimes.<br>
I submit a password request, and they delete all my files, say they’ll send me my password… forget to do it…</p>
<p>Everything was going fine than i released i was having all my players dc, there was major lagg, half the time i couldn’t connect to the viewer.php to even connect to the vps itself.</p>
<p>So…<br>
I submitted this ticket first:[/b][/i]</p>
<p>[code]Hi, i downloaded a virus attempting to get a gaming server running ended up deleting 2 user accounts on my computer and wiping out my files in attempt to clean up my pc and speed it up not knowing i didn’t have the desktop file “vps info” i had copied out of the email you guys sent me with all the vps info.</p>
<p>Email is <a href="mailto:techaneena69@yahoo.com">techaneena69@yahoo.com</a></p>
<p>Please, help ALSO!!!</p>
<p>MAYBE you guys can help me half the time i can’t even connect to the vps…<br>
Daily the server disconnects (whichs kicks all my players on my game offline = loose items = refund ON DONATIONS)<br>
this is a on-going issue, all im running is a java.exe process.<br>
Please help…<br>
I feel like i got involved with a shitty vps here.[/code]</p>

<p>[code]Gabriel,</p>
<p>Your VPS is a bronze VPS with only 512MB RAM with CPU limitations, we highly suggest that you upgrade. Also I will have to escalate this ticket to technical staff for them to get your VNC details</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>[i][b]ALL he told me there was some details about my vps plan, and suggested that i should upgrade, he than followed up by saying"I will escelate this ticket to get your VNC (VPS Connect) Details.</p>
<p>I replied with 2 more tickets:</p>
<p>First Ticket Submit:[/b][/i]</p>
<p><code>Do you know how long this is going to take, at the moment i have alot of players attempting to connect.
Once my password is back ill go in and remove my services with you guys stop the funds, and than upgrade.
I now understand the lagg i had a computer our in spanaway with about 512mb ram i didn't know that i will upgrade soon!
In the meantime i need mah password.</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Second Ticket Submit:</span></span></p>
<p><code>Still waiting for a reply, ill submit more tickets, i don't think this should take more than a day to lookup my password.
Very urgent people are now leaving, asking about refunds.
Please bump this and give me my VPS viewer connect password as soon as possible.</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Simply implying that I WILL upgrade my vps if needed.<br>
And please return me my password.<br>
(long story short i lost it on my hard drive during a cleanup)</span></span></p>
<p>Their next reply to my password request was:<br>
(Now… where in my speaches did i ask “please re-install my vps operating system?”)</p>
<p>[code]Gabriel,</p>
<p>Your VPS is currently being re-installed, I will have your account information emailed out to you within 30 mins - 1 hour.</p>
