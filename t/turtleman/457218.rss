    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/turtleman/457218</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not sure if you have seen the episode on discovery channel (I think that&#39;s the channel?), but this guy is simple insane. The show is called Call of the Wildman. He catches all of his nuisance calls bare hand, and is actually very intelligent despite his looks. He is 100% genuine and if you watch some of the earlier shows it is funny how awkward he is on television. He&#39;s quite possibly one of the nicest people that are on this planet. I&#39;ve seen some episodes where he will clean out an entire house just for 3 jars of canned green beans or a homemade sign the family made for him. He said it is those things that touch him the most. One time they rescued a copperhead from a banjo shop, and his friend (who plays the banjo) was given a homemade banjo from the shop that had all of these symbols that everyone knows Turtleman by down in Kentucky. On the show, when he was talking about it he started choking up he was so touched they would do that for his friend. If you haven&#39;t seen it, I highly suggest you watch it, as not only is it quite entertaining, but Turtleman seems to be a great man. There isn&#39;t a fake bone in his single body.

<p>I will agree completely that his actions seem to be genuine. This could also be the mark of a fantastic actor though. I’m actually going to see what I can dig up in regards as to his acting career.</p>

I hate this show with a fiery burning passion. Every time I hear this idiot yell “YEYEYEYEYEYEYE”, I put a newborn kitten into a sack and throw it into a river.</p>
<p>You can’t possibly judge someone’s character based on watching them on T.V. Sure he seems nice and genuine, but Jeffery Dahmer didn’t look like he killed people, had sex with their dead bodies, and then ate them.<br>
[/quote]Yet your judging him now  on his looks?[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m just making the point that you can’t judge a book by It’s cover. Saying It’s a decent show is one thing, but sucking off his character is another. The person everyone sees on the T.V. is The Turtleman. The person nobody sees on T.V. is the man who plays The Turtleman.</p>
