        <p>I’m gonna be honest here. First time posters don’t probably get much attention when it comes to launching a new server.<br>
Lurk around and post your opinions on other topics to get known. People need to know you are capable of running a server.</p>
<p>And I’m sorry if you are a rsc legend on other sites I’m just not aware of ^^.</p>

        <p>you wouldn’t happen to be these 2 people? …</p>
<p>Welcome,</p>
<p>RscEdition is a new server coming to the RSC community. The server is in development and is going to be for about 2-4 months. If anyone remembers RSCStake me and my brother dan are the ones who founded and hosted that server. RSCEdition is going to be 100% legit unlike all these other servers where the economy is flooded with billions of dollars. Our goal for RSCEdition is to get as close as the real rsc as we can. xp rates will be 100% identical to that of the orginal RSC. All F2P/P2P quests and skills will be 100% opperational. there is going to be two worlds. One world will be F2P and the other of course is P2P. you will have to subscribe if you want the membership features. Again like I said, we are trying to get as close to RSC as we possibly can. F2P will only feature that of a non member such as you cant wield dragon, do member quests ect… In the future, if successful we will be opening up two more servers along with the two we will already have. Meaning 2 F2P servers, along with 2 P2P servers. alot of dedication and hard work along with the players such as your selfs will make this server successful. Please give your input on how we should make the server better. pictures will be posted soon on the development of RSCEdition.</p>
<p>Thank you, and hope to see you soon in the community.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
Daniel.<br>
Dallas.</p>

I was pretty damn serious with RSCFusion. I worked 6-8 hours a day or more just to satisfy my community/players, part of the reason why I picked so bad mods was that I needed to have more time to develop rather than administrate the game, another reason is that Crooks really never was there to help.</p>
<p>The decisions I made upon game features were based on how the game was already, ore certer in mining guild etc. immediately I thought that it’s supposed to be somewhat casual gameplay, and balanced the game between the skills, after that, crooks came to me yelling that I made big mistake, I was damn confused, he was the one that left the certer there, and other features that made training skills easier. At this point, snoopy got access to our dedicated server(also crooks fault), and game was down for like 3 days, and I believe it was Friday because I decided to make it up to the players by increasing the experience for the weekend, at this point Tribal started creating some seriously stupid shit up, that I was helping a player to get to 99 smithing, which I wasn’t purposely doing, not to mention that the double experience rate was for everyone, not just ‘Printz’. The mods I chose were really nice to me and everyone else at the time I picked them, I looked at them playing while invisible and made my decision. The only, actually good mod was ‘Zen’, the other were selfish scumbags, helping their friends or themselves using commands. After I finally got things good, the player count was already below 5, every day.</p>
<p>I really learned from this journey, and I will never do the same mistakes again, and since I still have the database, files I will definitely re-try, if it would go better this time. And I hope this clears things up to those who still believe the rumors and give me another chance whenever I have the time and money to get RSCFusion running again.</p>

<p>I was pretty damn serious with RSCFusion. I worked 6-8 hours a day or more just to satisfy my community/players, part of the reason why I picked so bad mods was that I needed to have more time to develop rather than administrate the game, another reason is that Crooks really never was there to help.</p>
<p>The decisions I made upon game features were based on how the game was already, ore certer in mining guild etc. immediately I thought that it’s supposed to be somewhat casual gameplay, and balanced the game between the skills, after that, crooks came to me yelling that I made big mistake, I was damn confused, he was the one that left the certer there, and other features that made training skills easier. At this point, snoopy got access to our dedicated server(also crooks fault), and game was down for like 3 days, and I believe it was Friday because I decided to make it up to the players by increasing the experience for the weekend, at this point Tribal started creating some seriously stupid shit up, that I was helping a player to get to 99 smithing, which I wasn’t purposely doing, not to mention that the double experience rate was for everyone, not just ‘Printz’. The mods I chose were really nice to me and everyone else at the time I picked them, I looked at them playing while invisible and made my decision. The only, actually good mod was ‘Zen’, the other were selfish scumbags, helping their friends or themselves using commands. After I finally got things good, the player count was already below 5, every day.</p>
<p>I really learned from this journey, and I will never do the same mistakes again, and since I still have the database, files I will definitely re-try, if it would go better this time. And I hope this clears things up to those who still believe the rumors and give me another chance whenever I have the time and money to get RSCFusion running again.</p>

        <p>The most important aspect of any server is the economy. Doesn’t matter if its a skill, or a pk server, if the game items hold a value which satisfies players time, then you got yourself a server.</p>
