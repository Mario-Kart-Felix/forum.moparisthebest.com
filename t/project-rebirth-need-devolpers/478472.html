        <p>Hello my name is steven and i am one half co-founder of Project Rebirth. Project Rebirth is a 718/742 currently in the pre-beta stages. There is alot to be done, and to finish in time we need some more help. The intention of Project Rebirth is to have 100% of every skill, and as many minigames as we can. We have already began working on runecrafting and agility. We need at least one more devolper, to help us continue on with the skills. Once all our skills are 100% complete we will release for the beta. Then once all dupes/errors/nulls are fixed we will release to the public. Please dont say “its not possible” or laugh. If your not interested then simply ignore this. But if you are add my skype xxpressyxx, so we can discuss some things. Also i need 2 people to help us gather coordinates and object id’s as well as help us find items that are not working correctly. If your interested please let me know asap! If you would like to check out the source before joining, that can be arranged. Credits to Team_Rocket for application.</p>
