    <description>Okay, well this is my problem:
I can&#39;t download Hamachi so I&#39;m trying to find a new port that doesn&#39;t use this... Is there one that doesn&#39;t use Hamachi so I can play on it? (not including the default port which is 127.0.0.1. because it seems to never be running)</description>

              <p>um, for a refesh-port=like um, 5555, or 43594, i.p is like 127.0.0.1 (which is your server, nobody can join unless you have your server up and running)</p>
<p>Just look in advertisments dude</p>
