I can open the bank and put stuff in btw and all that it just does this each time I open and put stuff in on the cmd.
I get that anytime I open a bank booth or bank from banker.. No idea why? Anyone know. I deleted shop.handler(making server pvm with no shops) but I never used bank before that so I dont know if thats why.. 

Just retested it again on one that has no changes to it and it does it so its something with the bank on the server side.. But how do I fix it.. Please help I enjoy this server I am working on and want it to not do this. Thanks for anyone who helps me.  My [b]skype is skillscb3[/b] if you want to add me on there thanks</description>
