    <title>Someone please help me!?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/someone-please-help-me/505788</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am Fuze and I need help. I have recently made a rsps community called &quot;FuzeX.org&quot; (soon to be the best rsps community ever). I was hoping that someone could help me create a Webclient Creator for people to make webclients on. If you have any knowledge on this, [b]please reply.[/b]

Thank you for everything and thank you for your help, it is much appreciated.

Have fun,
Fuze</description>

<p>Lol, good luck.</p>
