    <description>[center]Hello users!

A lot of my players wanting to join my server can&#39;t get on the server. I know why. But I don&#39;t know how to fix the problem. Hopefully you guys can help me out!

[b]Yes[/b], the server is in fact online!

But I&#39;m having a problem connecting with MY client that I use. I actually messed up my IP addresses A LOT.

Do you know what the IPs should be set to for myself?

[b]NOTE:[/b] The server won&#39;t be playable by anyone until I&#39;m able to fix these issues!

[center]In my &quot;[b]server source[/b]&quot; folder and my &quot;[b]client[/b]&quot; folder I use, the IPs are all mixed around, and I&#39;m not sure what to change them to.[/center]

The below IP addresses that need to be changed to the correct IPs are bolded so you can see them.

[b]NOTICE[/b]: The IPs I&#39;m showing you MUST be changed to either [b]MY IP address[/b], the [b]SERVER&#39;S IP address[/b], or [b]127.0.0.1.[/b][/center]

[center]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]

[center]In my [b]server.java[/b] file, located in my &quot;[b]server source[/b]&quot; folder, my IP is coded like this:[/center]

&lt;blockquote&gt;().getHostName();
               if ( /*
                * connectingHost.startsWith(&quot;localhost&quot;) ||
                * connectingHost.equals(&quot;[b]127.0.0.1[/b]&quot;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[center]And also, still in the &quot;[b]server source[/b]&quot; file, my IPs are listed as follows in my [b]client.java[/b] file:[/center]

[center][b]First messed up IP address:[/b][/center]

&lt;blockquote&gt;   public int GetWorld(int PlayerID) {
      String Server = PlayerHandler.players[PlayerID].playerServer;

      if (Server.equals(&quot;[b]ploxscape.no-ip.org[/b]&quot;) || Server.equals(&quot;localhost&quot;)) {&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[center][b]Second messed up IP address:[/b][/center]

&lt;blockquote&gt;            playerServer = inStream.readString();
         } catch (Exception e) {
            playerServer = &quot;[b]ploxscape.no-ip.org[/b]&quot;;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[center][b]Third messed up IP address:[/b][/center]

&lt;blockquote&gt;if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;delta&quot;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !connectedFrom.equals(&quot;[b]ploxscape.no-ip.org[/b]&quot;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !connectedFrom.startsWith(&quot;adsl-99&quot;)){
            println(&quot;Not from localhost!&quot;);&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[center]And that is all that is messed up with my server source files. Remember, those IP addresses are set up in my [b]server.java[/b] file and my [b]client.java[/b] file in my SOURCE folder![/center]

[center]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/center]

[center]Moving on, the next thing that is messed up is in [b]MY[/b] actual &quot;client&quot; folder that I use to play on the server.[/center]

[center]The following IPs are set incorrectly and need to be changed, but I don&#39;t know to what:[/center]

[center][b]In my &quot;[i]Gui.java[/i]&quot; folder:[/b][/center]

&lt;blockquote&gt;         System.out.println(&quot;Connecting to update server&quot;);
         Serverip = &quot;[b]ploxscape.no-ip.org[/b]&quot;;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[center][b]And that is the only one that&#39;s messed up in my &quot;[i]Gui.java[/i]&quot; folder.[/b][/center]

[center]And the LAST file that has messed up IPs addresses is called &quot;[b]client.java[/b]&quot; and the IPs must be changed on this too![/center]

[center][b][i]&quot;Client.java&quot;[/i] server IP that is messed up 1:[/b][/center]

&lt;blockquote&gt;signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getLocalHost());
setserver(&quot;[b]127.0.0.1[/b]&quot;, &quot;43594&quot;);
method2(503, false, 765);&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[center][b]And then, the very last one:[/b][/center]

&lt;blockquote&gt;aBoolean1153 = false;
aBoolean1157 = false;
aBoolean1158 = false;
aBoolean1159 = false;
aBoolean1160 = false;
anInt1171 = 1;
aString1173 = &quot;&quot;;
aString1174 = &quot;&quot;;
server = &quot;[b]127.0.0.1[/b]&quot;;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[center]If you, or ANYONE, could potentially help me out with switching the IP&#39;s to their correct IP address so everyone could play the server, I&#39;d appreciate it so much!

Thank you for your time!
