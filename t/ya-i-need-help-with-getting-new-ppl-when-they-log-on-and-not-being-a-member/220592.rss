              <p>box, if you goto the playerhandler.txt or .java - most likely in .txt format -.- lol uhm then search “ismember” change that 0 to 1 itll SAY your a member but you wont be till u get added to the member.txt in teh “data” folder… lol thats what ppl dont understand… making a file writer for ppl who log in and kicking them to where they will relog will make them member… thats what i want!! lol</p>

              <p>bacon did your create your accont before or after the code i gave you because the last code i just gave you only makes new acconts nonmember. so it doesnt effect existing players.<br>
hope that made since.<br>
to turn a existing accont to nonmember go to the character folder find the persons name you don’t want to be member and scrool down until you see character-ismember = 1 and just change the 1 to a 0</p>
