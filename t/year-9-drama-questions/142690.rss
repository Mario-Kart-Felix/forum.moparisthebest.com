    <title>Year 9: Drama Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/year-9-drama-questions/142690</link>
    <description>Okay this is pretty basic but I have alot of other homework to do today.

Allright what I have to do is make a play with my group which I have done. But I am playing a clingy girlfriend (even know im a guy).
I need some questions to ask my boyfriend in the play. Because he has killed someone and is a lifeguard... here is an example one:

1. Where were you last night? I called you but you didn&#39;t pick up.

You see it is improvisation. And the person playing the boyfriend doesn&#39;t know what questions i&#39;m asking so I have to ask questions that will be hard for them to answer. They have to be fairly different to the one I have stated below.

Thanks it would be greatly appriciated.
