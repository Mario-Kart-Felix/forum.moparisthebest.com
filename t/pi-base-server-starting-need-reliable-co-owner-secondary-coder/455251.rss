    <title>PI base Server starting- need reliable co-owner/secondary coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-base-server-starting-need-reliable-co-owner-secondary-coder/455251</link>
    <description>Hey!
I&#39;m starting a server, and I can follow a tutorial, and customize a server, but I&#39;d like to have a secondary person on the server when I&#39;m not around. 
Coding experience will definitely give you an edge over others.
This position would include co-owner status, and you would have to be responsible, reliable, trustworthy, friendly, and mature. 
I&#39;d also prefer that you be over 16 years of age, but I&#39;ll take it on a case by case basis. You&#39;ll also need a Skype, and legible typing skills, with decent grammar and spelling. 

Reply here, and if I like what I read, I&#39;ll send you a Skype username and we can get started.

Thanks!
