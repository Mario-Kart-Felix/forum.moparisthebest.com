    <title>Horse meat</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/horse-meat/483186</link>
    <description>I&#39;m shocked at you guys. Not a single mention of this controversy yet.

So as most of you are aware, in some beef-containing products - particularly ready meals - horse meat (and also supposedly donkey meat) has been found - one Lasange was found to have 99% horse meat. 

How does this make you guys feel? How do you think the laws should be changed? How do we know what else goes into these meals? Would you try horse meat?

Discuss.</description>

<p>are you so dense that you can’t see the real issue? it’s not that people were being lied to or even that horse meat was being sold the issue is that the horse meat was being sold unknowingly</p>

</aside>
<p>they aren’t accusations, ready meals were found to contain (up to) 100% horse meat labelled as 100% beef meat, the supermarkets and people preparing the meals blatantly admitted they had no idea what type of meat they were getting or where it came from, the issue with this whole controversy is that no one knows where the meat being sold was “harvested” or whether it was even safe for human consumption, love ups this bad can very easily lead to a lot of people being killed<br>

Right, then like you and myself have stated, this is a huge problem. I hope this will call for a ‘revolution’ for these companies that produces these types of food, similar to Taco Bell’s fraudulent beef case.</p>
