              <p>I think you are aloud to talk about rep, just not ask for it or anything like that, but any ways, on topic, there was a few tuts, one worked awesomely but only with the 317 client, idk where it went but i had a really recent client and it wouldn’t work with it… I saw another one recently but i think the guy who posted it deleted it. I have a nice one from another web site, well i think its nice lol, it says its a 377, but it just stops and tells me im on the wrong site, if i get it working il post a link to where i got it from.</p>

<p>i am guarantee you will find the answer if you click that little button because there is already a topic on this in the client section. You may ask “why not just give me the link?” but that is training people to be lazy, and this may show them that they can find what they are looking for <span class="bbcode-b">much</span> faster if they just click the shiny blue button.</p>
