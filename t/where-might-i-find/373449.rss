    <title>Where might i find?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-might-i-find/373449</link>
    <description>ok i was wondering where all the game engine source code is. i dont care care what client version it is new or old. on the refractored clients do they include all of the engine in those or just where most of that stuff resides?

why i would like to know it to have a list of the files i need to look at and convert to another language. and also to get a better understanding of the clients ui and game engine.

idk if anyone know they whole engine or not. thx for any replies.</description>

              <p>im asking what files in the client would i look in to locate the methods that read, and draw images (example sprite.java), and models. the game animation methods (example anim.java). their methods for “rendering” their 3d content. the game physics.</p>
<p>also the i/o methods (example stream.java. idk if that would have all the information for reading and building packets. i know there are other classes that are used with the packets also).</p>
<p>idk if those example names are correct for refractored clients. most games i believe have a game engine which makes it easier to code the game; whats usually included in the game engine “library” are methods for physics, images, 3d models, ui, audio, etc.</p>
<p>im wanting to do some new things, and change somethings. idk how well this will work. i think 317 would be easier to do than 508+ b/c less code to go thru but idk how useful that 317 game engine would be compared to a newer version. is jagex’s newest game engine runetek 5? what version did they have for 317?</p>
<p>i think a starting place for me would be in the client class where the loading method is–progress bar. i know someone was making a jagex suite i dont remember who or what was going to be included (i think they made a map editor), but we can do a lot with the clients if we knew more about them (or at least if this information was shared with everyone).</p>
<p>does that make my question easier to understand?</p>
<p>edit: look jagex has a job opening for this specific thing. <a href="http://www.jagex.com/careers" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.jagex.com/careers</a></p>
