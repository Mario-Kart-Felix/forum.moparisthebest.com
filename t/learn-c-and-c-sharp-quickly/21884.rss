    <description>Hello mates,

How are you guys today? I know most of you are fairly good or are advanced programmers. I wanted to ask you guys, my friends, what is the fastest way to learn C++ and C Sharp. The reason why I need to learn these programming languages quickly is because I got accepted into the Science and Engineering program and have developed an interest in learning programming. 

I will start this off by giving you some background information about my life. I am 15 years old, as many of you know, and live in California. My friends and teachers at school call me DJ. I am 5&#39;9 and weight 120 pounds. I am both Punjabi and British. Some of my interests are playing basketball and tennis, coming to this forum, making new friends, and watching movies. I am fascinated by the use of these programs: Adobe Photoshop CS2, Macromedia/Adobe Flash and Macromedia/Adobe Dreamweaver. Although I suck at using them right now, I am eager to learn more about them. My favorite sections on this forum are the Tutorials, Programs, Web design, and Graphics sections. I am currently doing wrestling for school. Due to the large amount of homework I am given, I haven&#39;t been able to join the graphics section or pursue my online interests.

Now for information about the Science and Engineering program. To qualify for this program I had to write an essay, and had an interview with staff from the school. Luckily I was one of the 5 people out of 30 who made the team. As there are only 5 people in this group, I decided to go into the programming part of the program. My job is to help program the robots. We are going to create these robots from scratch and fully assemble them to perform the job that is given to use later in the year. After we create it, we are going to compete against other teams in tournaments. We only have 6 weeks to work on this robot and have to ship it off on the last day. Luckily, I still have a few months before we know what we have to make the robot do. However, it is important that I start learning C++ and C Sharp, the program languages, as soon as possible. Any help will be appreciated. Have a great weekend!

Thanks,
Leader</description>

<h2>Here is some information from the paper in front of me. The staff of the Science and Engineering program are counting on the students to learn about their specific focus area. Mine is computer programming, all the others seem boring.</h2>
<p>This year, students will gain a background in basic engineering. They will then choose a specific focus area:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Computer Programming[/li]<br>
[li]Robotic Software Design[/li]<br>
[li]Mechanical Engineering and Fabrication[/li]<br>
[li]Electrical Engineering[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Within their focus area, students will be responsible for designing and developing components of a robotic system to be entered in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Because this year’s program focus is Robotic Engineering, students will visit the robotics division of the Engineering Departments at UC Davis, UC Berkeley, and Stanford University.</p>

              <p>No this is an actual robot. It is made out of parts that range from $3,000 to $5,000. The tools we are provided with are $2,000. It can be made out of aluminum or other metals, and it has to have metal or wooden framing. It runs off of two batteries and is controlled by a remote control.</p>
<p>Example: Last year’s competition involved a shootout in basketball. Teams had to make the robot have an arm or another way to making the balls go into the hoop or space where it had to go in. Some of the robots were programmed to automatically find the light source and shoot directly in the hoop, and others had other ways of making the ball into the hoop. People used remote controls to make the robot move. The robots kind of battle each other.</p>
<p>Here is an image of the inner core of a robot. I couldn’t find any better pictures.</p>
