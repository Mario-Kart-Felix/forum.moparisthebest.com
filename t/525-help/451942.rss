    <description>Alright, I&#39;ve added a static rc altar at home, so when you click the altar, you get 10k xp in rc and it&#39;ll give you 25k cash. As my server is a pk spawnconomy it brings money in for new players. BUT, there is a problem with the thieving and rc objects. you must stand in a certain tile to use these but I find it highly annoying as other players might not know and they think its broken. Lol.</description>
