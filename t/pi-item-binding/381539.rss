    <description>im currently trying to make it so that when a player dies if they have an item such as dragon claws or ags the item will remain in the players invent regardless of weather the player is skulled or not, i have tried adding bits and pieces into item assistant and doing it that way but have had no luck

any help would be greatly appreciated,

thanks
