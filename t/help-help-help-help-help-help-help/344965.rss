    <description>I have a real urgent problem!!! This is my first time doing this kind of thing with my server. I added a variable to the server (508 btw) called quest1. I added it in filemanager to create it and in the player files in bulby. No compiler errors and then i see that Quest1 pops up in my character file. I am saying yay i added it w000t...Well then suddenly my friend was telling me he logged on and his account got reset. Then i logged on and my account also got reset. Then i got my stats up again logged out and in...and i was reset again. Every time i get reset for some reason. Please help me this is really annoying and i will accept any help right now! Thankyou.</description>
