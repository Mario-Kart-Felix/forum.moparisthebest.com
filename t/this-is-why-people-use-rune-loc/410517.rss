              <p>The example wasn’t meant to be taken like I would change my server’s name every few weeks. Don’t get to picky into the example as it’s just meant to show that there can be legitimate, none retarded situations where the IP field can be changed, or at the very least be able to delete your server and then add it back.</p>
<p>Here’s a decent example. I make a server. A month later it dies. Two years later I decide to make a new server. That means new name, and domain. Even if I decide to go with the same name, the domain would still have to be free.</p>
<p>Another pretty good example, moving from no-ip to an actual domain. Not a lot of servers start off with an actual domain. When I started my server, I didn’t expect it to get even 1/100th of the amount of players I have today, it was just something to kill time with. Why would I start off throwing money at something that before anything would have to go through a TON of competition in the form of hundreds if not thousands of other servers, on top of the already set in stone big guys.</p>
<p>In any case, I couldn’t care less what you do, I’m just trying to show you that there are legitimate, none retarded situations that can call for a domain change.</p>
<p>Oh and if you’re thinking “If I allow people to delete their server they can abuse the up time system.” Well, we all know that that would just place them at the bottom of the 2nd or 3rd page constantly. A server that is always there is not going to survive, so that guy will give up eventually anyway because honestly, no one looks past the 1st page, and the VERY few people that do, will not look past the 2nd. On top of that, the server is probably so shitty that he’s likely advertising on other servers and getting ddosed anyway.</p>

<p>Probably, why the hell would you ever change your servers name?  What would you think if I changed the name and domain name of the forums every few weeks?  You would think I am unreliable and a bad host that won’t last.</p>

              <p>Moparisthebest already stated a few times to just make a Sub domain which is completely free since you already own a domain so you should be able to do that through your Control Panel. You shouldn’t just use an IP address because if you switched to a different host you won’t be able to change the IP address since it is not a sub domain/domain/no-ip whatever you want to call it.</p>
