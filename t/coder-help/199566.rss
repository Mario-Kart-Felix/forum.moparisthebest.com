    <description>Hello,My Name Is 0wn3r Ge0 I Made A Server 3 Days Ago..And I Signed Up On Here And Wondered What I Could Do So I Found A Source (Total time logged in: 3 hours and 21 minutes.) And Wanted To Know How To Get A Coder I Was Thinking People Bribe Coders.
Well If I Could Get A Coder I Will Give The Coder Co-Owner.

Source I Got:Hiyascape *But Someone I Dled Source Of Coded It*

My Problem: I Do Everything Tut Says Ex:

  // Giving the player an unique look
        playerEquipment[playerHat] = 2643;
        playerEquipment[playerCape] = 6570;
        playerEquipment[playerAmulet] = 1725;
        playerEquipment[playerChest] = 2583;
        playerEquipment[playerShield] = -1;
        playerEquipment[playerLegs] = 2585;
        playerEquipment[playerHands] = 7457;
        playerEquipment[playerFeet] = 7114;
        playerEquipment[playerRing] = 773;
        playerEquipment[playerArrows] = 892;
        playerEquipment[playerWeapon] = 4587;
