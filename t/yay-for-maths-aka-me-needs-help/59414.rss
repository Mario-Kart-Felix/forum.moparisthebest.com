    <description>Hey hey

Well, yet again, I seem to have stumbled upon an ugly question. I present thee with the question:
[IMG]http://img412.imageshack.us/img412/448/mathsassignmentjl5.gif[/img]
At the moment I am trying to do this by finding an equation for each line. I just don&#39;t seem to be able to do it. Argh, it&#39;s making my head hurt.

Any help would be very appreciated.</description>

              <p>gimme some time and maybe i can help[br][size=1]Posted on: February 18, 2007, 11:31:28 AM[/size][hr]sorry i didnt have any time till now, but this is how i would do it.<br>
First curve<br>
its like an elipse but, i would just aproximate it by averaging the radius of 8 and 20, and find the circumference of the circle you get there, and divide it by 4 to get that part. the 10° would make virtually no difference.</p>
<p>Third curve. if you fold your paper in half, you would see that the first and 3rd curves are about equal width, concluding that the line for the third part would be 8 units over</p>
<p>so if you were to label each point on the graph with coordinates…<br>
a is (0,30) b is (8,10) c is (11,10) and d is (19(about),35)<br>
use the distance formula to figure out length of 3rd line, or pythagoreans formula, with the x-x and y-y which gives you distance formula anyways…</p>
<p>so thats my 2 cents for now</p>
