    <title>[614] &quot;Error connecting to server&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/614-error-connecting-to-server/430376</link>
    <description>Hello all,

I&#39;ve created several topics to get this working (different errors and stuff) and this is another one (sorry for that) because I&#39;m almost able to play this RSPS.

[b]I have downloaded the client and source from this page:[/b] http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,512733.0.html

I have a compiler in the SOURCE files but NOT in the CLIENT files.

[b]This is what the compiler gives me in the cmd window: [/b] 

Note: src\RuneExtream\update\BinaryParser.java uses or overrides a deprecated AP
I.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
Press a key to continue. . .

[b]This is the compiler&#39;s path (what you see in Notepad):[/b] @echo OFF
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_02\bin\javac.exe&quot; -d bin -cp lib/netty-3.1.5.GA.jar  -sourcepath src src/RuneExtream/*.java
pause

[b]This is the run.bat&#39;s path (to make the server start up):[/b] @echo off
title RuneExtream Server
&quot;C:\Program Files\java\jdk1.7.0_02\bin\java.exe&quot; -Xmx512m -cp bin;lib/netty-3.1.5.GA.jar RuneExtream.Server

[b]OS:[/b] Windows 7
[b]Java version:[/b] jdk1.7.0_02

So as you can see above the compiler works I guess cause people told me this text is what you get when the compiling worked.
I have changed the IP in the client files to: 127.0.0.1
[b]I changed it in the following files:[/b]

[b]Applet_Sub1.java
launch.java[/b]

I couldn&#39;t find anything else that inclused a IP adress in it so yeah.

So I can compile (in the source files, cause i dont have a compiler in the client files) and make the server start up, but it keeps saying  &quot;error connecting to server&quot; when i try to log onto 127.0.0.1

I tried copying the compiler to the client files and make it compile but that didnt gave me the exact same code and ive been told you cant have the same compiler code for source and client files.

So if anyone knows how to fix this, I&#39;d be very happy.

P.S. Sorry for this wall of text, I am just trying to give as much information as possible cause I don&#39;t want to waste your time posting a possible solution cause i havent stated anything above.

Thanks in advance.</description>
