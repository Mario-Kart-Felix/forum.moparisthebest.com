              <p>I removed arham from the list. In hindsight, he hasn’t been helpful enough to deserve a mention this month.  Also, Vain has not been as helpful <span class="bbcode-b">this month</span> as I first though (for the server help section I skimmed through a few topics and then searched for all posts by any notable members, I didn’t notice the gap in dates for vain’s posts).</p>
<p>So sk8rdude461 shall be the only Server Help nomination for this month, I think.</p>
<p>I nominated Davidi2 and Taharok because they seem to be the ones who consistently provide the most help in the sections, above the rest.</p>

              <p>I don’t have support for Arham 4’s nomination, seeing as he’s rarely constructive when he posts and hasn’t posted in more than a few threads this month.<br>
I have support for sk8rdude461.<br>
Vain_ helped a bit in the beginning of the month, but then sort of disappeared from the help sections and returned in the past few days. If you can show me some examples that would sway my opinion then I’m all for using that nomination.</p>
<p>RSCShadow has been helpful, so I support that nomination. Seeing as the section isn’t as active as last month concerning assistance, it is a bit tricky considering that not many posts have been made though.</p>
<p>The thing with general programming is that people tend to help with one thread once in a while. I’ve noticed Davidi2, HcoJustin, imthenull, Taharok and Lin, but it is all spread out across multiple threads.</p>
