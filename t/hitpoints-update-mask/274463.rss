    <title>Hitpoints update mask</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hitpoints-update-mask/274463</link>
    <description>Hello!

I just have a simple question(I hope so, lol):

How do I make a hitpoints update mask come up? In my thieving method I have it so if you fail to thieve, the npc stuns you, shows the GFX, and reduces damage. 

[code]getOwner().decreaseHP(getDamage());[/code]

The thing is, when I fail, it decrease my hitpoints and all. BUT, it doesn&#39;t show and update mask. It just does the block emote and decreases my hitpoints.

I want it to show and update mask for my hitpoints(the damage done), but I&#39;m not sure how I would go about doing this...

I appreciate any help.

Thanks in advance,
