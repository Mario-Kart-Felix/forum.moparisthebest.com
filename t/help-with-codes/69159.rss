    <description>I am planning on puttin [[b]classified[/b]] into my server.

Therefore, it detects when you get [[b]classified[/b]] in every working stat, and gives you a key.

The key unlocks a door to the [[b]classified[/b]].

I was wondering if anyone could help me make it so it detects when you have [[b]classified[/b]] in every working stat, gives you a key, then you can use it on the [[b]classified[/b]] door to get into the place. Only people with keys can get in.

How would I code this?
If you PM me, I&#39;ll release the [classfied]&#39;s.</description>
