    <description>hey im the owner of my server im about to put on the status but im doing pics and i was doing a nice d claw spec which worked i hit 3 zeros and a 194 and  1hit k0ed my opponent i tried 3 more times all 1 hit k0 so i tried a different weapon 1 hit k0.  i made a new acc got a steel scimmy and hit a 1 so its just me on the owner account. is there anyway to fix this so i just hit like as if i had 99 strength 99 def and 99 attack (which i do because im max&#39;ed) it coulda been a command i dont know! if it was 317 i woulda checked the characters folder then see if there was something like always1hitk0=1 but these are .dat files!
