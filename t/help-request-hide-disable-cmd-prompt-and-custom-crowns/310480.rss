    <title>[Help Request]-Hide/Disable CMD Prompt and Custom Crowns</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-request-hide-disable-cmd-prompt-and-custom-crowns/310480</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not so sure if this should be posted in Client Hacking or in Client Help - So if need be, please move it.
1.) Hiding CMD Prompt?
2.) Adding custom crowns?

Now.. 
1.) I&#39;ve been looking around trying to find a way to disable the command prompt that pops up when you run the client. The topic that hide your Client Folder and cmd promp that you are supposed to run on your desktop doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve tried. Does anyone know a way to hide it so that when I give out the client for download, and when they go to start it up it just shows the client with no CMD prompt. (If this is very jumbled, ask and I&#39;ll revise it to make it sound better - In a bit of a rush)

2.) GalkonsPride put out a guide quite some time ago explaining how to add custom crowns - it doesn&#39;t work. I&#39;ve looked and looked and can&#39;t even find the current Admin and Mod crowns that are default to the game.. I&#39;ve been told that they would be under mod_icons in the sprites folder - no. If anyone knows a guide or could simply explain it here on how to add them, that would be nice aswell. 

Like I said after #1, I&#39;ll revise it and give much more detail if needed to help me figure this out. I&#39;ve tried for about a month now and I think I have a grey hair. o.O
Thanks,

<p>I forget what the base is now…<br>
I think it’s PK Jadscape’s client?<br>
I’ll find it and update this post.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 08, 2009, 10:38:15 pm[/size][hr]Yes… It’s PkJad Scape’s client.</p>
