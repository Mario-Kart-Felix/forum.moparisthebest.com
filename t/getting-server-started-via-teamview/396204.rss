    <title>Getting server started.. via teamview</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-server-started-via-teamview/396204</link>
    <description>so ive been trying to get my server online for a couple days now and i have no idea how to. ive pretty much tried everything, had lots of people help me n all... i would like it if someone teamviewed me so i would never have this problem again. =/  so if u have time, could you please help me out? im thinking it has to do with portforwarding cuz when i go to that one site, it says it cant see my ip or something, so if you cant tv me but wanna help, could u guide me on how to fix that.
thanks guys!
