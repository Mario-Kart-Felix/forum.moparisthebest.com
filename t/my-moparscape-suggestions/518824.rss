    <title>My MoparScape Suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-moparscape-suggestions/518824</link>
    <description>Everyone seems to be suggesting a whole bunch of stuff, well I thought why not! :)


1 - Server status page needs to be 100% revamped.
     Why you say? This is an RSPS Community, other sites like R-S or RL have [b]main[/b] aims of the community. What&#39;s MoparScapes? The client, right? Well, I&#39;m not really into the RSPS scene much anymore but from what I hear that&#39;s a bit outdated and no one uses it. The community needs a main aim (the server status page), a main site, and the forum should only accent a website. What am I saying here? To take a bit of aim away from the forums? Well, yes. If you look at it from a web dev position you will know that forums will RARELY EVER make it. You MUST have something other than the forum that is used to bring in users. We need the Server Status page turned into a full blown Toplist. Why would this be smart? Well, SEO. We need to get as many backlinks to MoparScape onto the net as we can. This, in my opinion is the only way we can revive MoparScape to its prior glory. We still have a chance, we can do it.

2 - Forum themes
     Many people are against forum themes, why? Hell, I don&#39;t know. The fact of the matter is RSPS is full of younger kids. You need to appeal to this age group, which I&#39;m estimating to be around 12-17. These kids don&#39;t like boring! Simple as that, you need to aesthetically please your audience while at the same time smacking their face with knowledge. Now, do we need to go out and download any old theme and install throw it up? No. The MoparScape team really needs to put thought into and smash it&#39;s own unique look onto the RSPS scene.

3 - Forum Awards
    The forum needs more awards, this will get the community involved and you will see a major skyrocket of activity on the forums. Why? People will have something to work for. At the moment we only have awards that can be scored with a talent or if you&#39;re a veteran. What about the people who have no coding/gfx talent? What about the new guys? They need some lovin&#39; too!

4 - Shoutbox
      The community forum needs a shoutbox. Why? IRC to a beginner is alot to take in. All other RSPS communities have them and thats what they are used to. The better half of the community is hellbent against shoutboxes which is a complete atrocity. Okay, you understand and enjoy an IRC, but do new/younger users enjoy this? Do new/younger users understand the IRC concept? I&#39;m leaning towards not. This being said, get off your high horse and look at this aspect as a whole, not just from a first person point.

- - - MORE TO BE ADDED SOON - - -


EDIT: inb4moparisnotliker-sorrl

This post may seem like I&#39;m trying to suggest that MoparScape should be like other communities, to patch this assumption up, and make anyone who brings it up look like an ass, I&#39;m not. I&#39;m simply implying you need to bring familiar aspects into MoparScape.</description>

<li>That’s what I have been trying to say support!</li>
<li>Again, it doesn’t have to be a badge but it would be nice I guess. The only way to attract people is to have some form of a reward. That’s why I was suggesting featured tutorials in the news section, a sticky with the quality poster of the month, and etc.</li>
<li>I could see this in the FUTURE once the forums (if) they ever revive.</li>

              <p>Everyone seems to be suggesting a whole bunch of stuff, well I thought why not! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>1 - Server status page needs to be 100% revamped.<br>
Why you say? This is an RSPS Community, other sites like R-S or RL have <span class="bbcode-b">main</span> aims of the community. What’s MoparScapes? The client, right? Well, I’m not really into the RSPS scene much anymore but from what I hear that’s a bit outdated and no one uses it. The community needs a main aim (the server status page), a main site, and the forum should only accent a website. What am I saying here? To take a bit of aim away from the forums? Well, yes. If you look at it from a web dev position you will know that forums will RARELY EVER make it. You MUST have something other than the forum that is used to bring in users. We need the Server Status page turned into a full blown Toplist. Why would this be smart? Well, SEO. We need to get as many backlinks to MoparScape onto the net as we can. This, in my opinion is the only way we can revive MoparScape to its prior glory. We still have a chance, we can do it.</p>
<p>2 - Forum themes<br>
Many people are against forum themes, why? Hell, I don’t know. The fact of the matter is RSPS is full of younger kids. You need to appeal to this age group, which I’m estimating to be around 12-17. These kids don’t like boring! Simple as that, you need to aesthetically please your audience while at the same time smacking their face with knowledge. Now, do we need to go out and download any old theme and install throw it up? No. The MoparScape team really needs to put thought into and smash it’s own unique look onto the RSPS scene.</p>
<p>3 - Forum Awards<br>
The forum needs more awards, this will get the community involved and you will see a major skyrocket of activity on the forums. Why? People will have something to work for. At the moment we only have awards that can be scored with a talent or if you’re a veteran. What about the people who have no coding/gfx talent? What about the new guys? They need some lovin’ too!</p>
<p>4 - Shoutbox<br>
The community forum needs a shoutbox. Why? IRC to a beginner is alot to take in. All other RSPS communities have them and thats what they are used to. The better half of the community is hellbent against shoutboxes which is a complete atrocity. Okay, you understand and enjoy an IRC, but do new/younger users enjoy this? Do new/younger users understand the IRC concept? I’m leaning towards not. This being said, get off your high horse and look at this aspect as a whole, not just from a first person point.</p>

<p>EDIT: inb4moparisnotliker-sorrl</p>
<p>This post may seem like I’m trying to suggest that MoparScape should be like other communities, to patch this assumption up, and make anyone who brings it up look like an ass, I’m not. I’m simply implying you need to bring familiar aspects into MoparScape.</p>
