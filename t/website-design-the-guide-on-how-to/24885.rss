    <description>Building Your First Website A Guide On How To Do It Free.
Note: Following this guide will not cost you a cent and you will have a fully functional good looking website.
http://Distracted2.tk

Ok, Starting your website is usually the hardest thing to do, Next To Maintaining it. Before you even start go to [url=http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=dreamweaver&amp;loc=en%5Fus]http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=dreamweaver&amp;loc=en%5Fus[/url] And Download Dreamweaver 8. If that link doesn&#39;t work you may need to create a free account on there and then go to the trial downloads section and download Dreamweaver 8. Once you have downloaded it get your ass back here. Now when you start Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 again it will prompt you for a serial or to continue the trial. Click the link below.
[url=http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Dreamweaver+8%22+94FBR&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=]http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Dreamweaver+8%22+94FBR&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=[/url]
Now enter your new serial number and you have your software (You can use the same trick for any of the downloads their, Some may require a special crack though like Photoshop see).

Now you need themes and ideas to base your site around. Here is a check list for what you should have before actually putting in content and uploading.
Banner? Do you want a banner If so, what will it look like?
Slogan? Do you want a slogan? If so what will it be and how will it connect to your site.
Logo?   Do you want a logo? If so, What will be on it and will you include your slogan or site name on it?
Site Name, You need a site name something that the banner slogan and logo connect to in some way. This can also be your domain name.

Content, What is your site about? What are you going to put in there. Remember you need content people will actually want to look at. 
If you need some ideas take a look around some peoples sites and forums on moparscape. Some you should see for inspiration are:
www.goons.co.nr
www.distracted2.tk
www.spirak.net
Forums:
http://www.rs2armor.org/forums/
http://jmmyos.3.forumer.com

Templates, If you are going to have a site with or without a forum. You need a template. If you are going to make your own template i suggest you use tables or frames. Remember if you are going to make a template include all the code you want in this page. And use page properties button on Dreamweaver 8 to set how the links, background, fonts and colours will be set. If you don&#39;t wish to make your own template you can visit these sites to get one.
http://www.zymic.com/
http://www.freewebtemplates.com/
http://www.freetemplatesonline.com/
http://www.templatesbox.com/

Now you have your banner, slogan, content, logo, Site name and template. There all set up and working properly. [glow=red,2,300]TEST![/glow]The website on your computer before you even upload it. When you test i really mean you test it. Test every single link, Check that all the images/movies/games/flash work. And test them on Firefox, Netscape And Internet explorer.   Remember that around 90% of internet users use internet explorer. Make sure its compatible with IE and Firefox at least. Test the website on different screen resolutions. And even if you can different OS.

Now you need to choose your host. Let me recommend some hosts. Now if you were going to upload it onto a host you want a good one right? Remember you want decent Disk/Storage space. and good data transfer/Bandwidth. These are the main things you should look for. I also recommend that they have FTP Transfer. Here are [i]the[/i] best ones i&#39;ve seen or heard of:
www.unlimitedmb.com   They offer:
- 500GB Data Transfer
- 5GB Disk Space
- Fast 100mbit Internet Connection
- Automated Instant Activation
- yourname.ulmb.com
- yourname.com.net.sc
- PHP &amp; MySQL
- 99.9% Uptime
- FTP &amp; Browser Uploads

www.freehostia.com They offer:
 Absolutely FREE
 Data storage: 250 MB
 Monthly bandwidth: 5 GB
 Hosting for 1 domain
 5 subdomains
 NO ADS 	  	 
 Perl enabled
 PHP enabled

www.100webspace.com They offer:

• 100 MB Data Storage
• 3 GB Data Transfer
• PHP, Perl/CGI-BIN
• 5 Subdomains
• 1 MySQL Database
• 5 MB MySQL Space
• FTP Access

http://webhosting.nationvoice.com/ They offer
* 500 megabytes of storage space
* 10,000 megabytes of monthly transfer (10Gb&#39;s)
* 3 FTP Accounts
* 10 E-Mail accounts w/spam block
* 5 MySQL Databases
* Unlimited sub domains
* 1 Parked Domain

I think these are probably the best web hosts you are going to find any anywhere. Now, you must upload the files. Now most hosters will use a file manager thing at your control panel. You can upload things from there usually 2-3MB, But most of the time if they have it (all the hosts i listed do) you can use FTP (file transfer protocol). Now usually in the control panel of the site you will set up and FTP account. Once you have set up your FTP Account go to ftp://wateva your address is (just make sure you use ftp:// not http://). TEST THE SITE ONLINE. Before you tell anyone about it test it online. Test it better online then you did on your computer. After you have tested it there may have been some problems

Links not working: Remember that if a link goes to c:/documents and settings/bob/website/tutorials. That doesn&#39;t exist on the server so make sure you link it to where it is on the server.
Images/Flash/Movies not working: Same as link thing make sure you have the FULL address of where it is located on the SERVER.
Can&#39;t access pages or getting 403 error:You may need to CHMOD (change modification) The directory&#39;s, In the file manager bit at your control panel make sure the directory were everything is located you want accessed by anyone is set to 755 thats the setting you should have for stuff that you want accessed and not forbidden.

The ugly banners
Ahhh yes, Along with free webhosting comes those ugly, ugly banners. Now don&#39;t feel like you should pay that small fee to get rid of them just use these techniques to get rid of them:
Wrap the &lt;body&gt; tags in &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; Do the same for the head tags. If you have .tk adress or ads like them (little banners that follow you down the page put this in:
[code]&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
if (top.location != self.location)
top.location = self.location;
&lt;/script&gt;[/code]

Please note that when you put &lt;noscript&gt; tags around the body tag and or head tag. The page will not show up in Dreamweaver properly (if you made the changes to the original file and not using the HTML editor online)to make it show just get rid of the noscript tags and put them back in later.

Now you have no banners and your site up and running right. Now you need a reasonable URL. Use URL redirecting services for this. The two best i have found are:
www.dot.tk They offer www.whatever.tk they have a banner at the top a very thin one that can be removed by using the above code^.
www.freedomain.co.nr They offer www.wateva.co.nr, They ask you to put a link back to there site though on the first page. 

The way they work: You tell them your original address and then they forward that address to wateva you choose. Note: Every page will be www.yourdomain.co.nr/.tk 

Now you need traffic. Go to all the forums you know of and put your website in your sig, And in your msn name if you want. Tell your friends if you want to. And email it round.

If you want to get into serious web devoloping i suggest you learn some web coding languages from:
www.w3schools.com

Here are some resources for scripts and things that make your webpage look professional:
http://Resources.bravehost.com
In the computers section on my site http://Distracted2.tk
http://www.htmlgoodies.com
www.zymic.com
http://www.web-source.net/html_tips.htm

Make sure your website isn&#39;t/Doesn&#39;t have:

Confusing
Pop up messages
Poor load time
Over use of Java
Poor overall appearance
Poor use of HTML tables
Spelling/Grammar mistakes
Poor organization
No contact information

any way of going around that? or just by paying.</p>
<p>you might want to add favicon, Its a good way to make your site look more proffesional.<br>
I found this out from some tut a long time ago<br>
you just make a 16 by 16 image that resembles your website (logo, first letter of website etc.)<br>
save it as favicon.bmp then upload it to your images.  change the name to favicon.ico , then add this code to all of your pages</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon.ico" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>im pretty sure that works</p>

              <p>Building Your First Website A Guide On How To Do It Free.<br>
Note: Following this guide will not cost you a cent and you will have a fully functional good looking website.<br>
<a href="http://Distracted2.tk" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://Distracted2.tk</a></p>
<p>Ok, Starting your website is usually the hardest thing to do, Next To Maintaining it. Before you even start go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=dreamweaver&amp;loc=en%5Fus" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=dreamweaver&amp;loc=en%5Fus</a> And Download Dreamweaver 8. If that link doesn’t work you may need to create a free account on there and then go to the trial downloads section and download Dreamweaver 8. Once you have downloaded it get your ass back here. Now when you start Macromedia Dreamweaver 8 again it will prompt you for a serial or to continue the trial. Click the link below.<br>
<a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Dreamweaver+8%22+94FBR&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Dreamweaver+8%22+94FBR&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=</a><br>
Now enter your new serial number and you have your software (You can use the same trick for any of the downloads their, Some may require a special crack though like Photoshop see).</p>
<p>Now you need themes and ideas to base your site around. Here is a check list for what you should have before actually putting in content and uploading.<br>
Banner? Do you want a banner If so, what will it look like?<br>
Slogan? Do you want a slogan? If so what will it be and how will it connect to your site.<br>
Logo?   Do you want a logo? If so, What will be on it and will you include your slogan or site name on it?<br>
Site Name, You need a site name something that the banner slogan and logo connect to in some way. This can also be your domain name.</p>
<p>Content, What is your site about? What are you going to put in there. Remember you need content people will actually want to look at.<br>
If you need some ideas take a look around some peoples sites and forums on moparscape. Some you should see for inspiration are:<br>
www.goons.co.nr<br>
www.distracted2.tk<br>
<a href="http://www.spirak.net" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">www.spirak.net</a><br>
Forums:<br>
<a href="http://www.rs2armor.org/forums/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rs2armor.org/forums/</a><br>
<a href="http://jmmyos.3.forumer.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://jmmyos.3.forumer.com</a></p>
<p>Templates, If you are going to have a site with or without a forum. You need a template. If you are going to make your own template i suggest you use tables or frames. Remember if you are going to make a template include all the code you want in this page. And use page properties button on Dreamweaver 8 to set how the links, background, fonts and colours will be set. If you don’t wish to make your own template you can visit these sites to get one.<br>
<a href="http://www.zymic.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.zymic.com/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.freewebtemplates.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.freewebtemplates.com/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.freetemplatesonline.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.freetemplatesonline.com/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.templatesbox.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.templatesbox.com/</a></p>
<p>Now you have your banner, slogan, content, logo, Site name and template. There all set up and working properly. [glow=red,2,300]TEST![/glow]The website on your computer before you even upload it. When you test i really mean you test it. Test every single link, Check that all the images/movies/games/flash work. And test them on Firefox, Netscape And Internet explorer.   Remember that around 90% of internet users use internet explorer. Make sure its compatible with IE and Firefox at least. Test the website on different screen resolutions. And even if you can different OS.</p>
<p>Now you need to choose your host. Let me recommend some hosts. Now if you were going to upload it onto a host you want a good one right? Remember you want decent Disk/Storage space. and good data transfer/Bandwidth. These are the main things you should look for. I also recommend that they have FTP Transfer. Here are <span class="bbcode-i">the</span> best ones i’ve seen or heard of:<br>
<a href="http://www.unlimitedmb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.unlimitedmb.com</a>   They offer:</p>

<li>99.9% Uptime</li>

<ul>
<li>500 megabytes of storage space</li>
<li>10,000 megabytes of monthly transfer (10Gb’s)</li>
<li>3 FTP Accounts</li>
<li>10 E-Mail accounts w/spam block</li>
<li>5 MySQL Databases</li>
<li>Unlimited sub domains</li>
<li>1 Parked Domain</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these are probably the best web hosts you are going to find any anywhere. Now, you must upload the files. Now most hosters will use a file manager thing at your control panel. You can upload things from there usually 2-3MB, But most of the time if they have it (all the hosts i listed do) you can use FTP (file transfer protocol). Now usually in the control panel of the site you will set up and FTP account. Once you have set up your FTP Account go to <a>ftp://wateva</a> your address is (just make sure you use ftp:// not http://). TEST THE SITE ONLINE. Before you tell anyone about it test it online. Test it better online then you did on your computer. After you have tested it there may have been some problems</p>
<p>Links not working: Remember that if a link goes to c:/documents and settings/bob/website/tutorials. That doesn’t exist on the server so make sure you link it to where it is on the server.<br>
Images/Flash/Movies not working: Same as link thing make sure you have the FULL address of where it is located on the SERVER.<br>
Can’t access pages or getting 403 error:You may need to CHMOD (change modification) The directory’s, In the file manager bit at your control panel make sure the directory were everything is located you want accessed by anyone is set to 755 thats the setting you should have for stuff that you want accessed and not forbidden.</p>
<p>The ugly banners<br>
Ahhh yes, Along with free webhosting comes those ugly, ugly banners. Now don’t feel like you should pay that small fee to get rid of them just use these techniques to get rid of them:<br>
Wrap the  tags in  Do the same for the head tags. If you have .tk adress or ads like them (little banners that follow you down the page put this in:</p>
<p><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
if (top.location != self.location)
top.location = self.location;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>Please note that when you put  tags around the body tag and or head tag. The page will not show up in Dreamweaver properly (if you made the changes to the original file and not using the HTML editor online)to make it show just get rid of the noscript tags and put them back in later.</p>
<p>Now you have no banners and your site up and running right. Now you need a reasonable URL. Use URL redirecting services for this. The two best i have found are:<br>
www.dot.tk They offer www.whatever.tk they have a banner at the top a very thin one that can be removed by using the above code^.<br>
www.freedomain.co.nr They offer www.wateva.co.nr, They ask you to put a link back to there site though on the first page.</p>
<p>The way they work: You tell them your original address and then they forward that address to wateva you choose. Note: Every page will be www.yourdomain.co.nr/.tk</p>
<p>Now you need traffic. Go to all the forums you know of and put your website in your sig, And in your msn name if you want. Tell your friends if you want to. And email it round.</p>
<p>If you want to get into serious web devoloping i suggest you learn some web coding languages from:<br>
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">www.w3schools.com</a></p>
<p>Here are some resources for scripts and things that make your webpage look professional:<br>
<a href="http://Resources.bravehost.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://Resources.bravehost.com</a><br>
In the computers section on my site <a href="http://Distracted2.tk" rel="nofollow noopener">http://Distracted2.tk</a><br>
<a href="http://www.htmlgoodies.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.htmlgoodies.com</a><br>

<a href="http://www.web-source.net/html_tips.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.web-source.net/html_tips.htm</a></p>
