    <title>A Small Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-small-question/288975</link>
    <description>I have a standard Localhost client on my computer, but it doesn&#39;t connect to my server in the correct way it&#39;s suppose to do. I don&#39;t have Internet on the computer it&#39;s on, and the Client is the only one I got. I don&#39;t know how to fix this error, but yet I can&#39;t go on the Internet to download a new client, or to get help. My Client backup copy doesn&#39;t work either. The client doesn&#39;t connect to my server while i&#39;m left board. What am I suppose to do, because it&#39;s getting really annoying constintly trying to fix this.

Thanks.</description>
