    <title>A small question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-small-question/283739</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I have a client and source, and I was just wondering whether it s possible to combine run client and run server together, so i don&#39;t have to go in and out of folders to start my server... 

If there is actually a way, and anyone knows how, i would really appreciate their help.

Thanks
