    <title>Ubuntu HDD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ubuntu-hdd/543680</link>
    <description>So, I built a new server for my site and misc. things at my house. And when I did so I swapped out my HDD for a new 1TB drive since my other one was pretty old and I was afraid of losing the files.

When I installed Ubuntu 14.04 on the new drive I ran into an issue with my old drive.

This drive has never been apart of any RAID. The files should still be on there, if anyone knows a way to fix this, or to get around it. All I need to do is grab the files and I can&#39;t seem to figure it out.

Note: When I plug it into my HDD Dock and plug that into a Windows machine it just sits there, I can view it in Disk Manager, but that&#39;s it. The only option I can really do to it, is format it. And that is obviously not an option.

Help please.

The last thing I have tried is putting together my old server and trying to boot it up that way. But I don&#39;t think that will work, I took the drive to work and wasn&#39;t able to get into it. I have ran several HDD tests and the drive itself is not bad.

No I can&#39;t boot into it either on my current server. The OS on the drive is Ubuntu 12.04</description>
