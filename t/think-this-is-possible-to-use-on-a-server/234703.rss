    <title>Think this is possible to use on a server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/think-this-is-possible-to-use-on-a-server/234703</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;ve been on some RSCD servers. I thought it was pretty cool. I found something even cooler. There was a little sleeping bag. When you click on it, it keeps you from getting attacked and gives you a black screen and the get back to normal, you had to enter like &quot;2 1 q r z&quot;. Anyone know if it is possible to put on a 317 Server?</description>
