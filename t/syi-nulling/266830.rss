    <description>Everyone here should know what the Syipkpker does. It has two options: sending fake login packets and nulling. In order for my friend to be able to stop both of them, he needs to know what exactly &quot;nulling&quot; does. Anyone here know?

Oh, and he said that limiting connections per IP should help. But I figured I&#39;d ask here anyways.</description>

<p>No, because once one was fixed, if another pops up then you’ll need to ask someone how to fix it again.</p>
<p>You know, instead of learning just what you need to learn to make a server, how about learning everything related to private servers and stop asking to be spoonfed?</p>

<p>One question, one answer. If it’s a simple answer, then why is it so hard for anyone to just post it? Seriously, just someone post the answer.

<p>Your question is about Moparscape.  So judging by that post, it doesn’t fucking belong anywhere on this forum.  Now get the fuck out of here.  You and your friend belong at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com/smf/</a>…</p>

<p>Oh, and he said that limiting connections per IP should help. But I figured I’d ask here anyways.</p>
