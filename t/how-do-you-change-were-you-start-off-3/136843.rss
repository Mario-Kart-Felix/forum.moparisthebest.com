              <p>Hmmm… What did you search for? I think you should make a new account(Or go to the exact, spawn point co-ords.), then in client.java search for one of the co-ords. You should notice the spawn point co-ords. Should say something like spawn point ect. so search for the spawn co-ord till you find that.</p>
