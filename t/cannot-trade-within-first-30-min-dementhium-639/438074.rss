<p>If you’re wanting this to prevent abuse of your starter, in my opinion, your starter is way too big. None of this should be occurring in the first place if you want an economy.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to lower their starter because even if you implement this, you’re just delaying the inevitable.</p>
<p>Nonetheless to answer your question, do what imsuperman05 said, except to expand on his idea, include a player save. So nothing ipwnu2day says can happen, or if it does, they won’t <span class="bbcode-i">lose</span> any time logged in.</p>

<p>Well that isn’t very good. Every time you log in you have to wait 30 minutes?</p>
<p>Here is the problem with this idea:</p>
<ol>
<li>What if you wanted to trade with your best friend or staff immediately?</li>
<li>What if your computer accidentally crashes, internet shuts off, or maybe a power outage?</li>
<li>What if you updated the server?</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you see what I mean? It is ridiculous. Make it 5 minutes, or something. Something that is reasonable. I’m pretty sure people on your server would get peed off at you for making it 30 minutes.</p>
