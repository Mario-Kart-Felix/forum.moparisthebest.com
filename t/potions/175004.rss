    <description>Hey Guys,

I&#39;m using a devolution 7.0 server source and was wondering how to make potions give you 5+ levels then decrease slowly ( Like real runecape ). As a temporary resort until i have figured this out i have just made potions add experience  :|.
I&#39;m aware to add into case 132 and all of that its&#39; just the getting the potion to add to your level then decrease slowly.

All help is appreciated.

Thanx!   :)</description>
