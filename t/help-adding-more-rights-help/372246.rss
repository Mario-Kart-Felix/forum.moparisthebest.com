    <description>[center][b][u][size=36pt]HELP PLEASE[/size][/u][/b][/center]

I am wanting to add more right to peoplei n game. I have edited the picture icons and made them my self, all that works perfectly fine, but ONLY show for Mods and Admins, that shoukd be Mod and then Head mod.

Here is how it should be: (Staff)

Normal Player.
Moderator.
Head Moderator.
Administrator.
Head Administrator
Owner.

Only the Moderator and Head Moderator show up, can anyopne please help me show all of the icons? ALSO!

When I put my rights to 5, if I log in no commands work, I log out and check them and they are 0 again, any ideas? much appreciated! hope someone can help! :D

EDIT:

Donator problems, I am wanting to add a Super Donator as well as a normal donator, I alredy have the image for the normal donator and the rights thing, I am wondering how you add another, will be much appreciated!

Here is howw it should be: (Donator)
