    <description>[center][b][i]Using Lamarck&#39;s theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics states that characteristics acquired during an organisms&#39;s lifetime can be passed on to an offspring. For example, a giraffe stretches its neck to reach higher branches, and the longer neck is passed on to the giraffe&#39;s offspring. Now use your biology textbook or other sources to come up with examples of evolutionary change. 
[/i]



Explain how Lamarck would have accounted for these changes. Explain why this theory is unlikely to be true based on what you know about how characteristics are passed from one generation to the next.[/b][/center]


Yeah, it&#39;s due in about 9 hours. But I haven&#39;t slept in about 53 hours (No joke.)

I have no idea what to write. My brain isn&#39;t working, I&#39;ve had two Redlines. I&#39;m stressed from things going on.


Help?


I will &lt;3 you.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 18, 2009, 10:49:09 am[/size][hr]It&#39;s due in ten minutes when I drive to the school...
