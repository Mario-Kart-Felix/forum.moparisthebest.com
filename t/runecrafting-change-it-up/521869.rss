    <title>Runecrafting - Change it up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runecrafting-change-it-up/521869</link>
    <description>No one likes runecrafting. It&#39;s a dry, dull, and boring skill.
Especially on a rsps. That&#39;s why typically server&#39;s will set it&#39;s xp rate higher than the rest.

But lets change that. Lets change Runecrafting as a whole. Let&#39;s &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;

I was thinking, maybe the skill could start like this:
You get the essence, and the correct talisman (or tiara or what ever) and then use it on the correct altar.
From there, you&#39;d be teleported to a new location, based off the rune you&#39;re making.
Example:
I grab 27 rune essence, a air talisman, and use the essence/tali on the altar.
I then get transported to a place where I&#39;m tested on my wits using air.

What could we do for challenges? Like, what are some good idea&#39;s for challenges and such that could be used here.

Restrictions: They cannot be combat based (so skillers can do this too).
if gfx/anims are used, they must be based off runescape&#39;s. (I don&#39;t have custom ones nor don&#39;t know how to make em).
I only have revision 377 mapdata.</description>

<p>How about a maze that is randomly generated and utilities wind to damage the player if they get the wrong location, this could be applied to all aspects (water, fire) and for death runes it could kill the players thus making it rather daunting (increase the xp rate to make it a bit easier). Just a general idea, came up with it in a few minutes so i’ll post more when I get mentally stimulated lol.</p>

</aside>
<p>I could see how that would work. Like go into a runecrafting room, and pick a maze based off what rune you’d want to do, and each one would have different affects and such</p>

Because when you make an item harder to get it’s traded economically speaking if you have access to having there be millions of essence to just buy directly from a store gold isn’t being swapped between players.<br>

<p>In one sense you could have a stack of essence but to keep the skill “respectful” you have to make it hard. The only way to do this in an economy fashion is to make it harder to get/make people buy from other players.</p>
<p>In another sense you could keep it respectful by having it so you could mine it. No actual rule states you have to “mine essence” it could be something you craft from a “rock” for that matter.</p>

<li>If it was kept on a timer or # count before the action would break would be smart and ensured that players could not continually AFK the skill.</li>
<li>Most skills lack interaction. It would be up to the community to deem RC worth training in groups and remain game-focused.</li>
<li>Rather than making it rarer, why not just adjust the xp rate for RC compared to the rest of the rates for other skills? Magic is a really hard skill to continually train via combat, so by upping the amount of runes that may be produced, it will help balance out the issue to an extent.</li>

I was on one of the top 5 rsps’s a could weeks back. You want to know how hard it was to runecraft deaths? Get 1-2k ess, stand in the bank and run to the zammy mage, click death rune, and run back.<br>
They’re super popular. I don’t think there is an issue with what I was suggesting</p>
