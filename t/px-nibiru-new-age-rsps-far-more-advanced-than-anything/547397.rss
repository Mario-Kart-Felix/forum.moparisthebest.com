    <title>PX Nibiru | New Age RSPS | Far more advanced than anything!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/px-nibiru-new-age-rsps-far-more-advanced-than-anything/547397</link>
    <description>I created this project 2 months ago. I&#39;ve been doing it solo this whole time.
I&#39;m looking for two people to partner up with me, as it&#39;s better to have more than one set of eyes.
I have alot of plans, and I&#39;ve already put some into action, already making it far different than most.
There&#39;s going to be tons of features, you may as well call this RS4. My main goal is to provide 110% player &amp; employee satisfaction.
If I&#39;m lucky, I also want to change RSPS history, and introduce a ton of new amazing flawless features to everyone.
So then maybe I&#39;ll also inspire them to put their brain to actual use. That&#39;s all the info I&#39;m releasing for now, if you&#39;re interested and want to know more.
