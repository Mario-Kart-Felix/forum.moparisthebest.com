    <title>Question regarding choice of server and Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-regarding-choice-of-server-and-client/235904</link>
    <description>Hello, I need a suggestion on which server to pick. I&#39;m only coding for the fun of it, not looking to bring the server online, though i might ( if I can), i&#39;m just a little under an intermediate at coding private servers. I also need a suggestion on which client to use. And not one that isn&#39;t compiled into a jar. file. I have a macbook &#39;07 running tiger 10.4.11, and i can&#39;t seem to find the code to compile and run the client files. Any help is appreciated
I was coding around the time when moparscape 3.2 came out, so i want to know what servers and clients are like now[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 09, 2008, 08:28:49 pm[/size][hr]preferably a source that has npc training</description>
