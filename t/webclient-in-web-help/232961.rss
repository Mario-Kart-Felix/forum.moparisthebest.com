Code:
&lt;applet code=&quot;client.class&quot; archive=&quot;Pancakespk.jar&quot; width=&quot;766px&quot; height=&quot;503px&quot;&gt;
	&lt;param name=&quot;boxmessage&quot; value=&quot;Loading SSS&quot; /&gt;
Java is not installed on your machine or your browser does not allowed Java Applet to run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the latest Java technology at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.java.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.java.com/&lt;/a&gt;
