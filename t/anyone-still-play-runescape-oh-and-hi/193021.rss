    <title>Anyone still play Runescape? Oh and Hi</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-still-play-runescape-oh-and-hi/193021</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve cut down on my computer time a lot and the last time I logged into rs was around I dunno Dec 10? But I thought to myself, hmm I wonder how Mopar is doing? So here I am, how is everyone doing? Glad to see Ron Io9 and Jme are here still. 

Now that I&#39;m here, does anyone actually still play runescape? I was losing interest and then the whole wilderness fiasco happened so I stopped playing as well as going visiting my favorite old forums too.

Anyway Hey everybody, peace love and sex</description>

I was like sweet (i knew it was a scam but i was bored) so I logged in for the first time since hunter (logged in for a few hours since 2006) so he cant scam my 3k gold. I gave him my password and I was like ok now gimmie your hunter. He was like uh there is a problem ill have to do it later. I checked my mail to see if he changed the password which I knew he was going to but I was planning to do my easter even anyway which I did not even finish lol used my recovery about an hour later got my password back <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>morel of the story. RS sucks and people are to stupid to realize it they still try to scam accounts and will trade that 3k off.[/quote]<br>
Gotta be careful with this anyways because hackers whom realise they have an account with 1mil on it and can only trade 3k will most probably drop the 1mil in frustration.</p>
