              <p>~~ Port Fowarding ~~</p>
<p>If you are using a router… continue reading this section, of you’re using LAN (No Wireless), skip this part and move to “~~ Port Fowarding Pt. 2 ~~”</p>
<p>Now… when you’re using a Router when you host your server, you are going to do a few things;</p>
<p>1.) Open up your Network and Sharing Center.<br>
2.) Click on the one you use for your internet connection, and then click on Details.<br>
3.) Memorize your IPv4 Address as well as your IPv4 Default Gateway.</p>
<p>Now that you have your IPv4 Information, in your web-browser, type in your IPv4 Default Gateway, (usually 192.168.1.1) and then fill in the required fields. If you have never been into your Router, then the details should be:</p>
<p>Username - admin<br>
Password - admin /if admin does not work, then try password</p>
<p>When you are in your Router, you will need to head over to the Port Fowarding tab (used for linksys routers), and portfoward your RuneScape Private-Server on port 43594. If at all, your information should look like the following:</p>
<p>Application Name    | Port       | Port      | Type     | IPv4 Address<br>
RSPS                    | 43594    | 43594    | TCP      | (your IPv4 Address here.)</p>
<p>NOTE: Please remember after you fill in the information, to click the “save changes” button, as it does not automatically do this due to if you accidently fill in something wrong.</p>
<p>After you have done this, you may need too turn of the Filter MultiCasting option, this will be located under the Security Tab, disable that, and you should be done in your router.</p>
<p>~~ Port Fowarding Pt. 2 ~~</p>
<p>You need to make sure that ALL your firewalls are allowing incoming connections, and that your port 43594 is being accepted too accept connections from it. If you have no idea to do this, as this could be messy, I’d suggest for you to just turn off your firewall, as I used too do that and I’ve never had a problem with that before. But if you’re paranoid with ports open and your firewalls down, then I guess you should search on google how to accept ports on firewalls.</p>
<p>When you’re done with your firewall… you’ll need to make sure that your Path variable is set to where your JavaC is located. (The bin file that you saved your JDK at.). After this is verified, make sure that your Run.bat works for your server, if everything initializes, try connecting to yourself, or use the rune-locuz Status Checker (pings your IP too verify that your server is online.). If you can connect to your IP, then Congratz ^^, as you’ve just portfowarded your server.</p>
<p>~~ Creating A Webclient ~~</p>
<p>Jar your client.java, sign it, upload to a free webhost or your own website. :P.</p>
