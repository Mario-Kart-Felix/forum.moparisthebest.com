    <title>Orphaned case with no reason to have it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/orphaned-case-with-no-reason-to-have-it/269330</link>
    <description>title says it all my problem is an orphaned case:
Code:
clickingMost.java:994: orphaned case
case 9359:
^
1 error
Finished!
Press any key to continue . . .

thats my error it controlls some stairs or something i think because i typed in 9359 and got this:
Code:
				} else if (objectID == 9359) {
					stairs = 15;
					skillX = objectX;
					skillY = objectY;
					stairDistance = 3;
					stairDistanceAdd = 1;

im not sure but all i did was add d claws in a pvp source copied everything that says white claws code and pasted changed the numbers to what i needed

ok i never touched these cases or the object id all i did was add d claws and their spec (pvp) just copied the white claws and changed the numbers
if you need to see what i did feel free to ask i would just love some help</description>
