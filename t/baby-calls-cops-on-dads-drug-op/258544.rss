    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Police in Canada were given a lucky break when they stumbled upon a marijuana-growing operation after the culprit’s baby made a 911 call.[/b]

The 11-month-old boy, who was playing with the phone, inadvertently called police to his father’s house on Ottawa by pressing random numbers. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police believed they were responding to a 911 emergency call, in which the caller hung up without saying a word. The officers entered the house after their knocks on the door went unanswered, much to the surprise of the tot&#39;s dad. &quot;The father was very surprised to see us and insisted he hadn&#39;t called police,&quot; Constable Janelle Canning said. &quot;The officers then observed his 11-month-old child playing with a cordless phone, pressing buttons randomly.&quot; Some 500 marijuana plants were discovered in two locked rooms by officers who carried out a routine search of the house. The toddler&#39;s 29-year-old father was arrested and faces charges of production of a controlled substance and mischief. He is to appear in court in April. The baby boy was removed from the home by the Ministry of Children and Family, and was later released into his mother&#39;s custody.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>I’m glad he had a mother to return to, and not put into a foster home. His dad probably wasn’t even a bad guy. I don’t think they can charge him. He could win the case, although the evidence will still be confiscated which would suck. Canada is very good when it comes to things like this. For example if they were to pat you down for a weapon, and accidentally notice a baggy that feels like it has weed in it, they still can’t use it as evidence to charge you.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what mischief, but you are responsible for your children so it may have something to do with the 911 call.</p>
