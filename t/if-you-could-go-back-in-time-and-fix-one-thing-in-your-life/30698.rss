    <description>What would you fix? Post your story here.

As for me, I would go back in time to when i was at class 3, If I wouldn&#39;t have said one thing to friend...

Well, it was normal day, then &quot;She&quot; asked me to go with she and her friend&#39;s to a place what our school makes every year... Maybe you can call it &#39;party&#39;.

But then, I was so excited, I told her friend that i&#39;m coming with &quot;She&quot;, so he asked me to go to his home, and wait there until he gets.. So, when &#39;party&#39; was beginning, I went to my friend&#39;s place. He had something problems with his bag, and it taked 10-20 minutes. Then we went to school with bikes, (Here comes the but) BUT, &quot;She&quot; and her friends were already in line going there, and me and my friend were last&#39;s on line, when &quot;She&quot; went in, I never found him from inside there...

So, I would go back in time and would not tell her friend that I&#39;m coming with them. My life would be better now...(Maybe I wouldn&#39;t even go to sythe, then kaitnieks, then here.)
Anyway, just say what you would.. :o</description>

Didn’t thought about that.<br>
I’ll draw a picture about my own version of “timeline”<br>

              <p>Hmm…when I was little I used to overdose on my asthma medicine, Albuterol. It was an inhalant, so I suppose I got quit a bit of brain damage from the years I overdose big time. I used to make straight A’s, now I’m an average D and F student :X. So I would take back the day I learned that I could get high off of that.</p>

              <p>What would you fix? Post your story here.</p>
<p>As for me, I would go back in time to when i was at class 3, If I wouldn’t have said one thing to friend…</p>
<p>Well, it was normal day, then “She” asked me to go with she and her friend’s to a place what our school makes every year… Maybe you can call it ‘party’.</p>
<p>But then, I was so excited, I told her friend that i’m coming with “She”, so he asked me to go to his home, and wait there until he gets… So, when ‘party’ was beginning, I went to my friend’s place. He had something problems with his bag, and it taked 10-20 minutes. Then we went to school with bikes, (Here comes the but) BUT, “She” and her friends were already in line going there, and me and my friend were last’s on line, when “She” went in, I never found him from inside there…</p>
<p>So, I would go back in time and would not tell her friend that I’m coming with them. My life would be better now…(Maybe I wouldn’t even go to sythe, then kaitnieks, then here.)<br>
Anyway, just say what you would… :o</p>
