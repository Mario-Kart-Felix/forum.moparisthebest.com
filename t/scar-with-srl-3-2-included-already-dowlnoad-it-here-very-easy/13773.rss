    <description>Hello everyone,  I have had a heck of a time extracting SRL correctly and placing the right things in the right places but I finally got it working and I noticed a lot of other people were having the same problems.  Soooo I decided to go ahead and make a rar with everything set up right (with srl 3.2 included and the char thing).  I admit I am pretty much a noob and dont know how to write scripts or anything of my own but I just dont want to be a leecher so this is the best I could think of to contribute.  


INSTRUCTIONS

step 1:  If you already have scar, uninstall it from your computer.  After you do, go into C:&gt;program files and find the folder named Scar 2.03 and delete that folder.

step 2: download it [URL=http://&quot;http://www.megaupload.com/?d=5XUWF2UP&quot;]here[/URL]

step 3: Scan it for viruses with whatever virus software you have (if you dont trust me which you shouldnt because I am not well known)(i use avast its amazing and free)

step 4:  Estract the folder &quot;Scar 2.03&quot; to your &quot;program files&quot; folder in your C: drive.

and there you go it should work.  Thats as simple and clear as I know how to make it.


*note*
 if it does not put a new icon on your desktop for scar then just go to C:&gt;program files&gt; Scar 2.03 and just copy that icon and paste it on your desktop or something.
