    <description>Ok, I have tried turning off every firewall I have, updating to Java 6, and trying the game on both the site and the client. It will get to the part were it says &quot;downloading file 0%&quot; and it will just stay there and not do anything, the screen will flash but nothing happens, please reply A.S.A.P with the right answer for this, because I really wanna play Moparscape so bad it&#39;s not even funny.</description>
