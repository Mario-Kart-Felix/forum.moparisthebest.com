    <description>How do i make myself owner.

I changed in commands if savions sw does ´´admin´´ he gets admin rank, didnt worked, compiled, restarted source, didnt worked.

Do i need to do ::admin or what?

I went to search my file (savions sw) and found 2 files, savions sw.p

I cant read it and cant edit it.

So i went to player.java, but found nothing that help me.

If anyone could help?</description>
