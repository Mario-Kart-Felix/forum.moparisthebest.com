    <description>Just 2 things i need help with.

1: I really want a webclient and found a ASP host, but dont know how to format client or server or anything, and Dont know how to work a ASP hoster :P

2: im adding shops, but i just got started on pretty much a blank source, and i need to know how. I know where and i added id number and items and amounts, and added them where i want them,  but where it says [code]------------Sell----Buy----[/code] I dont know what to fill out there. When I trade with them, they dont sell anything. so i appreciate answers!</description>
