    <title>We need a new server (rsc-like)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/we-need-a-new-server-rsc-like/392334</link>
    <description>i got that feeling where i wanna play RSC. so i browse over here only to see theres nothing around. RSCEmulation is the only promising one, however it has a bad economy and im too rich on there for it to be a challenge for me. it&#39;s XP rates are too fast and it&#39;s somewhat based around a PKing server.

what happened to the good days of RSCD, it felt like it was actually RSC. someone that&#39;s not after money should just host RSCA source and everyone spread the word around. i&#39;d do my part in helping bugs/glitches from popping up. but i just mainly am looking to play a good rsc server. the admin would have to be someone, trusted, not some fag who would give phats to their friends etc.

i say everyone who&#39;s willing to do above post here, and the community decides who gets to be in charge of this server.

what ya all think? im sick of these pking/fast xp rate servers. need an RSC replica. (not sure if p2p or f2p)

we just need to put all this competition, power and greed aside and set up 1 centralized server where everyone can play real RSC again.</description>

              <p>As a few people have stated the high exp rate servers have made people lazy. The community is not its greatest and has deteriorated over the years. Not everybody is a follower of xEnt but what you see that is going around is the community coming together for a common goal. We all miss the days of how it once use to be. You say it can’t be done but yet the rest of the community is showing interest.</p>

<p>Because you have had the potions in the shops forever and now you’ve just abruptly taken them away. Don’t you see the problem here? I can tell you that it’s not because you’re trying to replicate RSC…</p>
<p>RSCE has become so much of a non-replica that it’s basically impossible to change it to one in it’s current state.</p>

<p>no offense to all of the work you put in to your server, but by the looks of it the average player count on your server at any given time is in the 150-180 range, which doesnt really impress me as much as it did when you had 300+ all of the time.<br>
And the reason why everyone bitches and complains when you make a change to make it more rsc-like is because you are constantly making dumb changes. You can go forward and then take a few steps back. Thats how you piss of players. You never saw Jagex make an update on RSC and then go back and make little changes to it… You server has too many changes too often, and not for the better.</p>

<p>well i’m hoping even attackers would like to come forward and share some light on how these attacks are made, to defend it. i’m sure during a beta period we would be able to iron out the bugs.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m sure this would be an easy accomplishment to bring in a few people. Nonames mentioned, but I know some lol.</p>

<p>Ive played many servers, and i know how brutal the grind is to 99hit points. i personally wont play another server that isnt atleast 5x-6x for combat. skilling i dont mind being 2x-3x, but combat needs to be faster otherwise people will quit. i personally have just about every type of pker on RSCE i could ever want, and all the pk supplies i will ever need. so its going to take an AMAZING server to make me walk away from all that.</p>

<p>I completely understand what your saying, but people WILL play a server that requires grinding. The only reason they would not is the fact that the longevity of the server is unknown. A server could last a few months and then those who grinded end up getting screwed. We need a server that will never shutdown</p>

              <p>I’ve always said from the begining, The only way to have an RSC Server enjoyable enough to play, Is to keep the economy and exp rate’s slow, We played RSC for the game play, So theres only one way to enjoy it and that is to replicate it with the challenge again.</p>
<p>The whole point of playing, Was how it was hard to gain your items, And every PK was worth while, Back when R2H’s were 700k - 1M, I think even bringing the slow trade back where it was almost impossible to trade 500k, You would have to constantly keep hitting space &amp; enter to keep yourself logged in during a trade.</p>
<p>Slow economy = Better Game play</p>
<p>Less Exp = Less PB’s just roaming the Wilderness, Raping the Master Fisherman for Foods and constantly portling to wild over &amp; over over, Ruining the wilderness/Harder gains on leveling/More people out for the challenge of skilling &amp; racing for top skills</p>
<p>Keep the Members wild seperate from F2P, Only allow members items weildable in the P2P Area, This keeps the people who prefer to P2P Happy as they have there own area to PK, Only thing is its deep wild, So anybody could be out there.</p>
<p>Like you said Xent, Get rid of Subs, And only allow for donations/add’s to keep the Server up, This should be a non profitable ran server, A People’s friendly server for those who enjoy playing the game</p>
