    Until(WtfEggs=10) Or (IsFKeyDown(9))
    Status(&#39;No Movement Detected, Moving Mouse&#39;)
    Sleep(500+random(9));
    MoveMouseSmooth(50+Random(300),50+Random(300));
    Sleep(500+Random(40));
    Status(&#39;Mouse Moved.&#39;);
  Until(IsFKeyDown(9))
  Writeln(&#39;YAY YOU WON!!!&#39;);
  WriteLn(&#39;Why Must you Leave now? I&#39;&#39;ve been having fun.&#39;);
End.
[/code]

I know All It does is move the mouse, But thats all it needs to do. I was messing around with cheat engne and I found the value that says how long youve been af(k,m) And I moved the mouse onto rs, and it went to 0 again, so, you&#39;ll never d/c and you&#39;ll learn something new ^^

It wont move the mouse after every 60 seconds, It checks to see if you moved your mouse every 6 seconds, And checks 10 times a minute (obviously).

And Don&#39;t Complain that I used MoveMouseSmooth... It&#39;s not like they&#39;ll even care about someone who is supposedly using a macro that doesnt even &quot;touch&quot; A button.

This Took Me HOURS to make (jk, it was like 5 minutes) so give me feedback.
