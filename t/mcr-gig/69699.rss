    <title>Mcr Gig</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mcr-gig/69699</link>
    <description>Hey i just got back from a my chemical romance Gig in brighton.
I&#39;m not to keen on there new album, but they played through that first and it was ok.
But then they played all their songs from three cheers, and the last final song was my favorite: Helena.
At that point some guys asked me if i wanted to crowd surf... i said yeah and i did.. my first crowd surfing to my favorite song... was so awesome, to make things better when i arrived at the front after being carried i saw people i hadnt seen for a while who were jellous that i was surfing.

Anyways just wanted to say that i had an awesome time at the my chemical romance Gig.</description>

              <p>I know! The only thing that sucked about the gig is that they didnt do one song from their first album.<br>
It was quite funny seeing the chavs wondering where the hell the stuff they were playing later (their second album) came from. like 70% of the people there only knew what the black parade song was, and i’d say about 20% were middle aged + over 50 hehe.</p>

              <p>i remember when i saw MCR a couple of years ago, when they supported Taking back Sunday. Awesome gig. MCR are an awesome live band and there first album is incredible, shame about there newest album and the fact that they were forced into releasing that corporate sponsored shit.</p>
