    <title>[317] How do I make it so you only earn 3 starters packs by IP? [DELTA]</title>

    <description>Hey all, I want to prevent people from keeping creating accounts and transfer the stuff, so I wanted to make it so you can only earn like 3 or maybe 5 starter packs by person (IP), I have seen this on a server that was on the toplist (Not gonna tell name, else you guys think I will be advertising) Does anyone know how to add this? I already added that you can&#39;t trade for like 10 minutes, but still people create accounts and keep those for online for 10 mins and transfer stuff, and banning is this time not the solution :(

Please post any help/ideas!</description>

<pre><code>        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>This is all i can do but give you the command and make it so the account its self can only use it once, if you want it to see if people are transfering items make a trade log and if you see any suspicious trades that look like transfering then ban them, other solution make ::Starter not have that much stuff in it, just the essentials so theres no real reason to transfer.</p>
