    <title>Saevion Problem #1</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/saevion-problem-1/3325</link>
    <description>Well, who here knows about the [i]Gemeni Twins[/i]? Well, obviously saevion doesn&#39;t.

The gemeni twins are two methods: boolean equals(Object o); int hashCode(); If you implement the equals method, you MUST implement a corresponding hashCode method. Equals method&#39;s must work when passed null.

I could go on, yadda yadda....

Anyways hashCode and equals(Object) should have the same results: if(o.equals(obj));
Then the same is for: if(o.hashCode() == obj.hashCode());

Unfortunately, if you did this wrong, java DOES NOT give a warning mess or error message to show why JAVA does not find the correct object correctly... But anyways:

Notice Saevion&#39;s hashCode() in FieldID, and MethodID... See how it just adds 3 strings hashcodes together? WELL, that&#39;s the FIRST problem with the deobber! You can&#39;t add it like that, and generate a valid hash.

So, what would be a fix for it? The following is a valid hashCode() method.
[code]
    public int hashCode() {
        int result = 17;
        result = 37 * result + name.hashCode();
        result = 37 * result + signature.hashCode();
        result = 37 * result + className.hashCode();
        return result;
    }
[/code][br][size=1]Posted at: May 26, 2006, 04:01:20 pm[/size][hr]It&#39;s important to note: This is one reason i frown upon Saevion and everyone who uses his work.</description>

<p>The problem deals with inheritence. </p>

<p>Once you subclass it, your subclass meets the instanceof requirement check. If a subclass and a super class is compared using  equals of the super class, and the other things in the equals checks are the same, it returns true. :eek: </p>

<p>Attached a rar with source for 5 classes, one uses instance of and has a subclass, another explicitly checks for null and uses getClass and has a subclass as well, and a main.</p>

<p>Ok, lets see how the hash of a value is calculated. The docs tell us<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">The hash code for a String object is computed as
 s[0]*31^(n-1) + s[1]*31^(n-2) + ... + s[n-1]
using int arithmetic, where s[i] is the ith character of the string, n is the length of the string, and ^ indicates exponentiation. (The hash value of the empty string is zero.)</code></pre>

<p>That means after 7 characters an 32-bit integer will overflow (32*ln(2)/ln(31)=6.5). Ok I agree, for strings shorter than that ppls code has indeed the advantage of producing less collisions. For longer strings the probability of collisions will be the same though.<br>But saevion's code certainly is not wrong, just a little bit less efficient.</p>

</blockquote></aside>

<p>Sorry, but I don't see any improvement of your way of calculating the hash value over Saevion's. I don't see how you want to achieve the equality<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto"> o.equals(obj)  == (o.hashCode() == obj.hashCode())</code></pre>

<p>by using hash values. I mean, calculation of a hashvalue is <em>not</em> a bijective map. In other words there are always collisions (different objects that yield the same hash code), so basically your code only changes for which objects there are collisions but you did not and in a general situation cannot get rid of collisions.<br>Anyways, the point of the hashcode is <em>not</em> to uniquely determine whether two objects are equal but for effecient storage of objects in hashmaps, hashtables etc. If you want to know whether two objects are the same you must use equals.</p>

              <p>Quite a few. This is one of the most important, when the jvm caches and uses a hashcode.... Guess what! It frall's up, know why? Because the "Classtype @ hashCode()" will make the jvm return two of the same object, when really they're not the same... Good Game caching, this is the MAIN problem with saevion's deobfuscator</p>

<p>well, its great that your actually posting code  :eek: <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>but just because someone makes a mistake doesnt really mean anyone should "frown upon" them, if thats how it works I cant imagine how many people frown upon me <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> </p>

<p>everyone needs a little constructive critisism though, thanks ;D</p>

<p>edit: just out of curiosity, how many problems are in saev's deobber?</p>

              <p>In regards to this deobber, I believe it has no direct effect whatsoever.  From my quick scan, I saw no reference to the hashCode method, whether directly or through a hashed collection.  Therefore, making the change just makes the validates hashcode generation.</p>

<p>It doesn't make a difference yet, but if you were ever to use a hash-based collection using the MethodID or FieldID classes as the key (which would probably be unlikely), there is a rare chance that it might not function totally perfectly.  By just adding together the hashcodes of the three strings in the classes, there is the possibility that the hashcode might turn out to be equal for two classes when each of the individual strings used to calculate the hashcode are not directly equal.  Therefore, multiplying the result by a prime number after adding each value eliminates the risk of two objects with different field values (used to calculate the hashcode) being considered equal.</p>

<p>So in short, it really doesn't affect the running of the deobber in its current state.</p>

              <p>I've actually never gone through the source well enough to pick on anything.  But, sure that's the proper way to generate hashcodes, and Saevion obviously messed up, but I don't think that's a reason to frown upon him.  He (as well as others, like you) should be applauded for his hard work in putting something like his deobber together.</p>

<p>Anyway, no one said it was perfect <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/slight_smile.png?v=3" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Well, who here knows about the <span class="bbcode-i">Gemeni Twins</span>? Well, obviously saevion doesn't.</p>

<p>The gemeni twins are two methods: boolean equals(Object o); int hashCode(); If you implement the equals method, you MUST implement a corresponding hashCode method. Equals method's must work when passed null.</p>

<p>I could go on, yadda yadda....</p>

<p>Anyways hashCode and equals(Object) should have the same results: if(o.equals(obj));<br>Then the same is for: if(o.hashCode() == obj.hashCode());</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you did this wrong, java DOES NOT give a warning mess or error message to show why JAVA does not find the correct object correctly... But anyways:</p>

<p>Notice Saevion's hashCode() in FieldID, and MethodID... See how it just adds 3 strings hashcodes together? WELL, that's the FIRST problem with the deobber! You can't add it like that, and generate a valid hash.</p>

<p>So, what would be a fix for it? The following is a valid hashCode() method.<br></p>

<p></p><pre><code class="lang-auto">    public int hashCode() {
        int result = 17;
        result = 37 * result + name.hashCode();
        result = 37 * result + signature.hashCode();
        result = 37 * result + className.hashCode();
        return result;
    }</code></pre>
