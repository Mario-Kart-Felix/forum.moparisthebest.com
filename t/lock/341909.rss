It’s simple.</p>
<p><code>A---------------------B
|                              |
|                              |

|                              |
C---------------------D</code></p>
<p>Lets say the distance from each letter to the next is one mile.</p>
<p>So if you were trying to get from point A to point B and you walked from A to C to D to B you would walk 3 miles.</p>
<p>If you walked from A to B you would walk 1 mile.</p>
<p>After you end up at point B from walking three miles you would be much more tired than if you only walked one mile, which makes each way have different results.</p>
<p>It would be much easier and require much less work to go from point A to point B than from point A to point C to point D to point B.<br>

We were arguing about work the whole time. Don’t stray from the original argument.</p>

Let’s just use an arbitrary number to represent force, say 10.<br>

work = 10 * 1 block<br>
work = 10 * 3 blocks</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure they are different?</p>
<p>Now back to the original problem, if you are so intent on using the work forumula, let’s use 5 for force and the distance will be the number of steps to get the answer.</p>

Work = 5 * (steps (distributed) + 1)</p>
<p>Using our arbitrary number (5) you can see that the work is ‘5’ more than using the distributed equation.[/quote]</p>

<p>I believe you are all confusing work, and perhaps displacement.  You calculate work like this:</p>
<p>work = force * distance</p>
<p>Therefore, since going the long way around means longer distance, it means more work was done.</p>
<p>However, the end result (maybe the correct word is displacement, but it’s late and I haven’t taken physics for years) is the same either way.</p>

Wow I didn’t wanna call you a dumbass, but w=fd, with d representing <span class="bbcode-b">displacement</span>. Get your facts straight before trying to make a fool of me.</p>
