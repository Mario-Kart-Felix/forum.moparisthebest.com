              <p>Alright, so basicly, this is what I’m planning for it to be. When finished, you only can get bigger by killing other fish (gun or eating them with your fish if your fish is bigger than the targeted fish) and that gives you money and a score. The bigger fish you kill the more score and money you get, if a fish bigger than you hits you, your dead and every weapon deals its own damage but that is not ready yet. This is basicly a hardcore RPG-like survivor fish shooter for facebook to get the highest possible score. Also when your score gets higher the enemy fishes get stronger give more money and get faster. You will also be able to buy items like extra hp, more speed and weapon upgrades. When that is done I have to integrate this with the facebook highscore system wich I have no clue on how to start with so that’s going to be a serious sandwich. All in all, I have to do a lot more to call this a game and this will be finished in about 2 weeks I think if I worked about 2 hours per day on it.</p>

<p>Hello fellow moparscapers, I’ve been working on a little facebook game (also going to make a kongregate and newgrounds version) and I’m still working on it but lately I showed my work to some of my friends and they found it cool and stuff but they’ve said that the general idea of the game is stupid and pointless, I kinda thought they were right. That is the reason I’m asking the help of you guys, tell me what you think, do you think it is awesome to kill fish underwater with an ak47? They told me do something else, instead of under water and fish put something else. So yeah that’s pretty much it, if you guys have any ideas of what I should replace the fish and under water with, please share it with me. Or if you think it is perfectly fine how it is now then mention that aswell.</p>
<p>Also, when testing the game, on the top left corner you will see “FPS”, telling me what the average and minimum values you are getting would make me really happy and if you could give your pc specs with that aswell then you would make me REALLLLLY happy.</p>
<p>And also, if you notice any bugs <span class="bbcode-b">THAT ARE NOT OBIVOUS FOR A GAME THAT IS NOT COMPLETED YET</span> then please put them in the comments below.</p>
<p>P.S. The bug where you use a Desert Eagle or a Glock with one bullet on a fish and there is not blood when shooting, that one I already know.</p>
<p>And the bug where when using an automatic gun and clicking and releasing <span class="bbcode-b">REALLY</span> fast, you see the gun and or blood animation but the score and ammo do not change.</p>
<p>And also, you can test it at this adress: <a href="http://www.vreg.byethost3.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.vreg.byethost3.com</a></p>
<p>THANK YOU ALL!!!</p>
<p>Another P.S. If you have a slow connection then please wait a couple of seconds and give the game time to load, don’t think because it shows you white screen that it is not working it is just loading. Haven’t made a preloader yet.</p>
<p>And PLEASE do not send me messages telling to make a game for or with you and become rich because I won’t. So don’t waste your time.</p>

Hello fellow moparscapers, I’ve been working on a little facebook game (also going to make a kongregate and newgrounds version) and I’m still working on it but lately I showed my work to some of my friends and they found it cool and stuff but they’ve said that the general idea of the game is stupid and pointless, I kinda thought they were right. That is the reason I’m asking the help of you guys, tell me what you think, do you think it is awesome to kill fish underwater with an ak47? They told me do something else, instead of under water and fish put something else. So yeah that’s pretty much it, if you guys have any ideas of what I should replace the fish and under water with, please share it with me. Or if you think it is perfectly fine how it is now then mention that aswell.</p>
<p>Also, when testing the game, on the top left corner you will see “FPS”, telling me what the average and minimum values you are getting would make me really happy and if you could give your pc specs with that aswell then you would make me REALLLLLY happy.</p>
<p>And also, if you notice any bugs <span class="bbcode-b">THAT ARE NOT OBIVOUS FOR A GAME THAT IS NOT COMPLETED YET</span> then please put them in the comments below.</p>
<p>P.S. The bug where you use a Desert Eagle or a Glock with one bullet on a fish and there is not blood when shooting, that one I already know.</p>
<p>And the bug where when using an automatic gun and clicking and releasing <span class="bbcode-b">REALLY</span> fast, you see the gun and or blood animation but the score and ammo do not change.</p>
<p>And also, you can test it at this adress: <a href="http://www.vreg.byethost3.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.vreg.byethost3.com</a></p>
<p>THANK YOU ALL!!!</p>
