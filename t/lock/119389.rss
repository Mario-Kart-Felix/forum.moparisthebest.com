    <description>Ok, some of your know that i host the Kaos Scape server.

I was hosting my server happily and then these 5 guys with random names, like SYIpkpker€,  SYIpkpker$, and things like that but anyway. There was like 6 of the people and once they signed into my server, everything went wrong, all of a sudden there was 150 nulls on my server.
Ever since this happened my server (the computer that the server is running on) has been acting strange like it has a virus on it (it dosen&#39;t). It has been freezing randomly and when i do to shut it down it just freezes and dosen&#39;t shut down. I have to shut down it manually.

EVERYONE THAT HOSTS A SERVER PLEASE! I REPEAT PLEASE! BAN THIS IP!
[code]ool-18b92509.dyn.optonline.net[/code]

I have started this topic to warn people about this!

I am sorry to the vets if i have posted in the wrong section.</description>

<p>is a proxy server better luck next time…</p>
<p>and u have been ddosed lmfao owned!!!</p>
<p>ddos :</p>
<p>the master sets several zombies(dedicated senders) up then makes them send numberless connections to 1 victim making the victims connection overflood,and crash</p>
<p>i suggest u use no-ip adress next time and make 3 so u can random switch between them.</p>
<p>also if this person did get ure ip he can keep ddosing u until u ip-refresh and if ure internet provider doesnt support that u will need to reformate ure pc.</p>
