If you’ve ever bought a Celine bag (and a lot of you have), you know it can be a complicated and, at times, frustrating process. When the Celine Luggage Tote first gained popularity several years ago, the brand forbade retailers from selling its wares online, which drove bag lovers to call and visit any number of department stores and boutiques in search of the right bag in the right color. Celine bags are now easy to come by in stores, though, so why can’t the brand just make us happy and sell them online? A couple of years ago, for a company trying to build caché and buzz with a new designer and a nascent It Bag on its hands, Celine’s online sales ban made a certain amount of sense. A big part of fueling consumer desire in the luxury sector is creating the impression that your product is rare and valued highly by those who seek it, and if a bag is available at every online retailer known to man in a variety of colors, it’s hard to make the case for rarity. Making something hard to get only makes those who are interested yearn for it more, and making its bags (and everything else) scarce worked wonders for both Celine’s buzzworthiness and its bottom line. Now that the Luggage Tote has reached critical mass and Celine has solidified its spot within the industry, though, it might be time to change courses in order to reach even more customers. The bags are no longer impossible to come by.
