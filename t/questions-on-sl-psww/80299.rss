 Basicaly, The script workds different for me than it does for everyone else. I have folowed people that are useing the same script and thy all walk the same path but if i let lspsww pick the colors it walks so weird and always ends up getting lost and logging off. and than it will say going to accoutn 1 but i odnt want it to logg on account 1. it dont have an account 1 i only wanted to use account 0 but if i set 0 where it says how many acounts do you wana use it says error on line 75.So are the people that are useing lspsww setting there own colors? if so will you show me how to set my own colors? pleas ehelp i just want this 1 script to wrok, and maybe a yew script oncei m lvl 60 wcing. please help im so mad that this isn;t working!

              <p>Well, you should choose players that will have a good nick, the name you have as an example would be bad.  Here is an example:  Blahblahman would be hbla or soemthing in the middle of the chars name (no caps).</p>
<p>and about players, the startplayer is 0, and the HowManyPlayers is how many player things there are below(so if you delete them all except the one with [0]'s, then put 1 in the HowManyPlayers</p>
