    <title>Portforwarding Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-issue/555281</link>
    <description>Whenever I port forward my server just to play with my friends, I put my ip onto the client and it would not work for my friend. I checked my ports and canyouseeme and portforward.com said that they were open. If someone could add me on skype I could give a visual explenation.
