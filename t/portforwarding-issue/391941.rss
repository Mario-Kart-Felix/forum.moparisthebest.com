    <title>Portforwarding Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-issue/391941</link>
    <description>Alright, so I made myself a static IP address for my new computer, Removed the protocols for my old one (ports 43594, and 25565). Made new ones for those ports on the new static IP both TCP and UDP, but it doesn&#39;t work. When I start up my Minecraft Server it says that it couldn&#39;t bind to the port and says that the port may already be in use (but by what?) and when I try to use a chat program I&#39;m making it can&#39;t create a socket based on my IP and port 43594.

These are the two protocols.
