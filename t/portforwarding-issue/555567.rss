    <title>Portforwarding Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforwarding-issue/555567</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using the Vencillio source&amp;client.

I&#39;ve changed the ip in my client, aswel as i&#39;ve port forwarded the port 43594 on my router. I run my server and goto &quot;canyouseeme.org&quot; and it says nothing is blocking the port but when i try to test my client with one of my friends it wont work, i can&#39;t figure out why. any suggestions?

              <p>If you’re trying to connect to the host on the same machine the server is running on, you should connect via a local address. (localhost, 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1, etc)</p>
<p>If your friend is trying to connect from a different machine on the same network, he should be trying to connect via the ipv4/ipv6 address. (ipconfig)</p>
<p>If your friend is trying to connect to the host from a different machine on an outside network, he should be trying to connect via your physical address (whatsmyip) or a dynamic address (dyndns, no-ip, etc)</p>
<p>If you’re correct attempting the connection and still not connecting, check to see if you have any firewalls enabled blocking the port or application from allowing network connections.</p>
