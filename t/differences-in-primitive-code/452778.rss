    <title>Differences in primitive code</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/differences-in-primitive-code/452778</link>
    <description>What exactly are the differences in: 

• Increment/decrement operators such as &quot;++&quot; and &quot;--&quot; and additive/subtraction operators such as &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;

• if(smartass == jerk), if(smartass != jerk), if(smartass.equals(jerk))


Also, with assignment operators are these the same?  x += (x+y) and y += (y+x), 

But if that was the case the subtraction way wouldn&#39;t be the same (as the negative would change up the answer each time) x -= (x-y) and y -= (y-x)


I&#39;m new to java, and I&#39;m really working hard to learn more about it.</description>

Now, the difference between pre- and post-fix are in the evaluation of the expressions as part of larger ones. When used as standalone expression statements, they have the same net effect; when used as part of a more complex expression, it matters.
<blockquote>The increment/decrement operators can be applied before (prefix) or after (postfix) the operand. The code result++; and ++result; will both end in result being incremented by one. The only difference is that the prefix version (++result) evaluates to the incremented value, whereas the postfix version (result++) evaluates to the original value. If you are just performing a simple increment/decrement, it doesn't really matter which version you choose. But if you use this operator in part of a larger expression, the one that you choose may make a significant difference.</blockquote>

So, that being said, (a == b) and !(a != b) are equivalent; similarly, (a != b) and !(a == b) are as well. In the case you're comparing objects, these operators are used for [i]identity equality[/i]. If, instead, you want to figure [i]semantic equality[/i], use [url=http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)]Object.equals[/url].
For example, ("abc ".trim() == "abc") will evaluate to false, since the literal string object "abc" and the result of "abc ".trim() do [b]not[/b] share object identity, while ("abc ".trim().equals("abc")) will evaluate to true because they're still [b]meaningfully equivalent[/b].

Neither of those examples do the same thing. x += (x + y) is shorthand (if we ignore type caveats for a second) for x = x + x + y, whereas y += (x + y) is y = y + x + y. Does that seem the same to you? Same logic for the subtraction ones.</p>
