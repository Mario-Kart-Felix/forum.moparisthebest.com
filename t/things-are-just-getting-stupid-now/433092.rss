    <description>Apparently..even the word &quot;negro&quot; (inb4 I get banned by Tom for saying it on here &gt;.&gt;) is considered a racist remark? It is the Spanish word for &quot;black&quot; The COLOR black. I said I had a negro sheep in my pitfall, and Tom got all pissy saying that it&#39;s just as racist as n***er. Now...I accepted the fact..kinda..that racism and sexism were put against the rules. I&#39;d have to say that I agree and disagree with that choice, I don&#39;t like racism (The actual looking down on someone, or doing things unfair to someone just because of their race) Or sexism (Actually making a woman belittle herself or beating a woman, etc.). When I&#39;ve heard so many black people make &quot;black jokes&quot; and use the &quot;n word&quot; (All forms of it.) Shit..in todays society here in America it is used as a greeting. &quot;What&#39;s up my nigga?&quot; I also don&#39;t see what it sexist about joking around about women and sandwichs.

Oh well...the main thing that got me to posting this topic is the fact that the word negro was made to look like a racist remark..It was not used in a racist way, it was used as a color of a sheep, but apparently it&#39;s racist.

I wonder what next is gonna be considered &quot;racist&quot; when it&#39;s not.</description>

              <p>if it counts, i reported yt awhile ago for extensively using the word “nigger” in a racist term. actually he said something on the lines of “nigger” and “picking cotton”, not a shit was given. in fact, i was told “racism isnt against the rules”. i realize it wasnt a rule at the time, but i think your whole “racism” rule (now) is being taken to an extreme extent. same with the “english server only” rule. its blatantly obvious that he wasnt using the word “negro” in racist terms. the word negro simply means black, which he was referring to his sheep.</p>
<p>and about the english only bullshit, i got on for about an hour and heard about 3 or 4 people use words from a different language. i even forgot, and used some myself <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
your not going to stop the COMMON non american words from being used on the server, no matter how hard you try. arguing with someone who uses them is a waste of time.</p>
<p>of course you aren’t going to see yourself as childish. its the same reason i will not see myself as childish, that goes for everyone else in this thread. acting childish is simply an opinion based on someone elses beliefs.</p>

<p>Explain to me how I’m harsh/Childish?</p>
<p>You’re all arguing that standing up for what you believe isn’t childish and that’s exactly what I’m doing? It’s childish to assume that your beliefs are the only ones that can be stood up for. I’ve took an attack tonight and I’m still posting here trying to discuss it maturely, and you’re all having none of it.</p>
<p>If none of you are going to have a real discussion without all this attacking, and drawing things into it then I won’t reply, I originally posted because I wanted suggestions, discussion, but all you’ve proved is that you won’t suggest/discuss all you people do is launch attacks when all I wanted to do was listen to what you have to say.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is: Stop seeing me as some form of dictator, if I do something then feel free to politely, with manners make a topic and then debate until we reach a conclusion. You’re the ones playing the server after all. This idea that you can all gang up and put on pressure won’t work I’ve had more than enough practice dealing with large groups of people on forums  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Now if everybody is ready to discuss this properly then start below.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">nig·ger
   [nig-er] Show IPA
Usage note
The term nigger  is now probably the most offensive word in English. Its degree of offensiveness has increased markedly in recent years, although it has been used in a derogatory manner since at least the Revolutionary War. Definitions 1a, 1b, and 2 represent meanings that are deeply disparaging and are used when the speaker deliberately wishes to cause great offense. Definition 1a, however, is sometimes used among African-Americans in a neutral or familiar way. Definition 3 is not normally considered disparaging—as in “The Irish are the niggers of Europe” from Roddy Doyle's The Commitments —but the other uses are considered contemptuous and hostile.

noun
1.
Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive
     a. a black person
     b. a member of any dark-skinned people.
2. Slang: Extremely Disparaging and Offensive . a person of any race or origin regarded as contemptible, inferior, ignorant, etc.
3. a victim of prejudice similar to that suffered by blacks; a person who is economically, politically, or socially disenfranchised. </code></pre>
<p>When it reality, it’s mostly like this: A word that everyone else is afraid to define except in utter seriousness, for fear of being branded a rascist, in total ignorance of the colloquial usage of the word, its characterization in popular culture, and the populations of people it is used most by.</p>
<p>Racism is the general belief that one race is better then another. I can firmly say that 99% of the common users of this forum are not racist, but instead a number of them just young, idiotic or immature. I realize that nothing I can say will change your general standpoint on the word, and I have no problem with racism being not allowed, but as a word, let’s just face it, it’s a <span class="bbcode-b">word</span>. Racism is only based off of your interpretation of the word. I don’t mean in things like context (even though that does make a difference) but it’s all about how people, as individuals, process that word in their brain and believe what it really means. No one word is racist, no one word is not racist. I could say “those people” and it be taken as racist, or I could say “chink” and someone be perfectly ok with it. There is no one true meaning behind a single word, and no one single belief to follow up on it. Words can change, words have changed, and words will continue to change.</p>

You all need to stop referring to your particular local culture, this is an international server which allows people from all over the world to play. If a word isn’t offensive in your culture but is in others then it isn’t allowed - if you want to describe a sheep as black say black sheep.</p>
<p>There is no definite need for the word. I’m just waiting for the smart remarks now using words that no one has ever heard of that are offensive.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>no, it doesnt allow people from all over the world to play. it prohibits any other language then english. not everyone is privileged enough to speak the language you do. it was a negro sheep if he wants it to be a negro sheep. just because you are childish and get offended by the spanish word negro doesnt mean it wasnt a negro sheep. because (technically) it was a negro sheep.[/quote]Neither Tom or I are offended. The server does allow for anyone to play, if you want to talk using a different language use the private message feature.  Regardless of whether anyone was offended it’s essentially the same as saying black oveja, which is using Spanish and against the rules. The English definition is clearly different from the Spanish one, and eventually you will learn words from different countries are not interchangeable. If you have a problem with the rules you can quit or be muted. I’ll leave it up to you.</p>

              <p>Incorrect, people can play from all over the world and they do, they usually come in groups and have done through out the servers history they communicate by private message and are accepted into the community with translators.</p>
<p>The server is perfectly playable by those who don’t speak English.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Tom_BETA, post:13, topic:433092”]You all need to stop referring to your particular local culture, this is an international server which allows people from all over the world to play. If a word isn’t offensive in your culture but is in others then it isn’t allowed - if you want to describe a sheep as black say black sheep.</p>
<p>There is no definite need for the word. I’m just waiting for the smart remarks now using words that no one has ever heard of that are offensive.[/quote]</p>
<p>no, it doesnt allow people from all over the world to play. it prohibits any other language then english. not everyone is privileged enough to speak the language you do. it was a negro sheep if he wants it to be a negro sheep. just because you are childish and get offended by the spanish word negro doesnt mean it wasnt a negro sheep. because (technically) it was a negro sheep.</p>
