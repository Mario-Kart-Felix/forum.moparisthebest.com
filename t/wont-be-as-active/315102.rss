    <title>Won&#39;t be as active</title>

    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;m not sure if this is against the rules but I just want to let you all know that I won&#39;t be as active because my computer got fried over night. I need to stop leaving my computer on so much. Now, my computer tower is useless so I&#39;m keeping my hard drive and my processor but the rest is junk. So with this being the case, I have to use my family computer which EVERYONE uses so I just won&#39;t be getting on as much for pretty much a year, or until I buy new components and windows 7 for a new computer that me and my friend will work on. Aaron, sorry I won&#39;t be able to get on RSPS Universe much. I&#39;ll get a new computer eventually. See you all every now and then! Bye! :/</description>
