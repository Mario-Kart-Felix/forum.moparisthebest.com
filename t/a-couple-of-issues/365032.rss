    <title>A couple of issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-couple-of-issues/365032</link>
    <description>alright.. here are my two problems.. I don&#39;t know for sure how to change the drop rates in a pk planet source..  if anyone can help with that it&#39;ll be appreciated.. 

but thats not my actual problem..

I need the gfx id for the dds spec, and also

I fixed d claws spec to hit 4 times in PvP but for the life of me i can&#39;t figure out how to make it hit 4 times on npcs.. any help there will be greatly appreciated

these are my d claws spec methods

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 8002 &amp;&amp; specialAmount &gt; 49){
specialAtk(false, 50, 600, 6000);
DDS2Damg = true;
AttackingOn2.dclaws = 4;
frame174(291, 000, 030);
dclaws = 4;
specOn = false;
AttackingOn2.DclawDamg1 = misc.random(Math.round(((playerMaxHit)*20)/15));
}[/code]

that works on players so i figured I&#39;d change a line or two and it would work on npcs.. I was wrong.. this is the code

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 8002 &amp;&amp; specialAmount &gt; 49){
specialAtkNPC(false, 50, 600, 6000);
DDS2Damg = true;
//AttackingOn2.dclaws = 4;
frame174(291, 000, 030);
//dclaws = 4;
specOn = false;
//AttackingOn2.DclawDamg1 = misc.random(Math.round(((playerMaxHit)*20)/15));
}[/code]

if you need to know i commented out the lines because they where throwing up errors and i couldn&#39;t figure it out.</description>

              <p>i use pk planet source right now, very simple!<br>
let me give you kind of a template for how the drop rate works<br>
now when you open your npcdrops.cfg, you should be confronted by this on the very top<br>
and something like this under it<br>
/<em>npcdrop = (NPCID)	(ITEMID)	(ITEMAMOUNT)	(HOWMANYTIMES!)</em>/<br>
/<em>King Black dragon</em>/<br>
npcdrop = 50	1747	1	100<br>
npcdrop = 50	4675	1	2<br>
npcdrop = 50	14000	1	0<br>
npcdrop = 50	1149	1	2<br>
npcdrop = 50	2577	1	2<br>
npcdrop = 50	2581	1	3<br>
npcdrop = 50	536	1	100<br>
npcdrop = 50	16015	1	1</p>
<p>now to explain it, the 50 is the npc’s id (in this case king black dragon)<br>
the second number is the id of the item dropped, the 3rd number is how many of it is dropped, and the last one is the percentage (1-100)<br>
ok, so lets look at this code:<br>
npcdrop = 50	536	1	100<br>
536 is dragon bones, the king black dragon drops them, only one per drop though, all the time<br>
now here is how you would read it:<br>
king black dragon drops 1 dragon bone all the time<br>
king black dragon = 50<br>
dragon bone = 536<br>
drops 1 = the 1 after 536<br>
all the time = the last number 100<br>
and dont be confused, because the last one is the rate of drop, if you put that as 1, it will be very rare, if you put it as 0, it wont drop it at all, i dont know if decimals will work though, so i think the lowest is 1, and the highest is 100, which means the npc will drop that item all the time<br>
as for the gfx, you should have a “notes” folder were your compiler is located too, open that, in there will be npc ids, some coordinates, objects, and oh, what is this? GFX! yes!</p>
