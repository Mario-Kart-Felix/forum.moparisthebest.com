<p>Sadly I think you are the misconceived person here…</p>
<p>Sadly from what I see you are 22 so you should even know this. Back when we were younger we didn’t worry about going outside and some rapist or kidnapper abducting us and still shouldn’t. Showing fear is being just as liable as as letting the person abduct you in the first place cause that’s what motivates them to do it they want to see that fear. If you get kidnapped or touched by somebody you don’t want/need touching you do one of two things</p>
<ol>
<li>kick, scream, punch, whatever it takes to get away</li>
<li>run away and get help</li>
</ol>
<p>it’s quite simple really so let’s not even go into environmental safety topic with me.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Are you trying to tell me that you have NEVER threatened to run away, had a smidgen of a thought to run away, ever ran away? I’m sorry but I am not about to take taht for anything. It doesn’t even have to be “running away” if you think your life could be affected in a more positive way in a different atmosphere then guess what you just thought about a life in another way somehow then with your family.</p>
<p>Children DO run away on a daily basis whether or not you wish to believe it. Half the crap you see on TV is just misinformed reporters. Why? Did anybody see that eight year old abducted? No, funny cause he came home 48 hours later but of course the news didn’t say anything/report on that now did they? Why? Because it makes them look stupid.</p>
<p>Stop believing everything you see on TV and live what little life yous till have left.</p>

        <p>I didn’t say it was a rare occurrence, I merely said it is ignorant to state that EVERYONE runs away. Also, thinking and doing are two different things. However no I have not thought about running away or threatened it.</p>
<p>Your ignorance is yet again shown by thinking that just because someone struggles means they can get away. Did you not see the 3 girls who were kidnapped while doing things such as going to school? I sincerely doubt that all three of them said “welp, guess I’ll just go along with this!” That’s called blaming the victim. Don’t be that guy.</p>

<p>Sadly, stuff like that is why I don’t watch the news any longer. As far as “what did they do” I doubt there was a group of three plus men who attacked them to abduct them therefore at least one of them could had run/screamed/whatever.</p>
<p>You just can’t use an example of something you see on the news as an example of life and the stories thereof. If you have never thought about leaving home well all I can say to that is you must had been an only child.</p>
<p>I can relate to the OP. Why? I have two older brothers and two younger sisters. The eldest sister gets on my nerves all the time, but I know how she feels exactly cause I take care of both of them now financially. Don’t even try to talk to me like it is uncommon for people to run away. i could link you to more than one famous site where ti discusses the reasoning why children decide to “run away”.</p>
<p>I don’t support it, I don’t like it, and I don’t suggest it coming from somebody guess what who actually did for a VERY short time.</p>
<p>Maybe you got into a fight with a sibling, maybe you got mad at mom and dad when they punished you. Where I grew up though you did as you were told, when you were told or you got told to turn around and get a switching like you never seen.</p>
<p>See that’s the difference in us you haven’t seen real discipline quite frankly.</p>

<p>3 brothers were in this if I’m not mistaken, so you would be wrong on that.</p>
<p>Oh and getting hit isn’t discipline, it’s fear. If you get hit (I’m going to assume switching is slang for hit) you don’t make the connection with doing something bad and there being a consequence for it, you become afraid that if you don’t do what they want, then someone will hit you.</p>
<p>OT: you say that it pisses you off because they think they are the favorites. This can mean a multitude of things, so if you can clarify what exactly happens then I think we can tell you what you might want to try that will help your situation.</p>

        <p>Well I (assume) that one of those three brothers would be driving the get away vehicle? ~!^ so one would still be loose.</p>
<p>Are you so sure about that? When you hit a dog with a newspaper does that make the dog be fearful? Or does it teach him not to take a crap on the carpet? If you enforce the discipline by explaining what was done wrong then it gives a stingnitism(misspelled I know…) so they understand not to do it again, and motivation to not do it again.</p>
<p>OT: I still stand by my original topic. Being mad at your family/siblings isn’t going to change. You will be mad at them for many years to come even as adults you can get mad at siblings and your other relatives. The logical thing to do is to talk it over with them either individually or as a group. “family meeting?”</p>
