    <description>[size=15pt][b]I&#39;m willing to give +10 rep to anyone who helps me throughout this problem. If you use teamviewer, then ask me for my ID and Pass.[/b][/size]

Hi guys. Ok so I just got started on working on my webclient for my currently-being-developed server, UsmanIsland.
But then there is ALWAYS a problem.... When I log from the webclient into the game, it loggs in and gives me a black screen. I get so happy that it&#39;s finally loading, but after 3 seconds, it loggs me out.

This doesn&#39;t happen when I login from the client. All is successful when I login from the client, but not the webclient.
Please help! Lots of people wouldn&#39;t want to download the client to play.

Thanks,
Usman</description>
