    <description>Hey...

At the risk of sounding like a noob, which i probably do right now, is there a tutorial out there about how to add dueling thats not on rune server? (it went domain expired i think). Ive tried creating my own duel arena out of scratch but it ended up as a complete epic failure, the interfaces wouldn&#39;t even show up, i suck at action buttons. Ive been looking for days, as its the last feature for my new server. I&#39;d appreciate any help i can get :D. If it matters im using Richscape V4 as a base, which was made off of czar.</description>
