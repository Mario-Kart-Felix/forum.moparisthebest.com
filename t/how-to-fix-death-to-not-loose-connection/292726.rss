    <title>How to fix death to not loose connection?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-fix-death-to-not-loose-connection/292726</link>
    <description>I still got this thing i can&#39;t figure out, it&#39;s one of my last problems:
When any non-admin dies he/she looses all items and looses connection!
Any help will be thanked greatly and gets credits on my client!
(To admin/mods/trusted people just tell me and i send my client.java and you may check it out..)
[i]Thanks for trying[/i]...

EDIT: this only applies when non-admins dies to NPCs, NOT when going on a PvP death..</description>
