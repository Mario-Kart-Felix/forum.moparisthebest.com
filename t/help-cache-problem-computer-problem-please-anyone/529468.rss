    <description>[b]Hey guys been working on a server called TrisidiaX for a couple of days now.
i currently have a server online called rune-x-scape which have been working fine now a couple of days later all my sources &amp; clients have this!

Maybe u could try fix this? https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=591060.0

i have no idea why this is because a couple of days ago it was fine.
so i tested my other source &amp; clients and i have the same problem cant seem to download the cache of any of them?
maybe its nothing to do with the cache maybe its on my computer anyone know?
could this be a program problem with winrar or .zip?? anyone?? // i have changed nothing - reinstalled the trisidiaX again - Same Problem!

so i currently have spent all my hard work into servers that i cant even go onto now because the cache dont work
i downloaded the cache from a thread and moved into my :C Drive and opened the client and still errors! why!

this is 90% my computer because all my sources &amp; clients have the same problem but work fine on my laptop

Thanks Josh

<p>Search for findcachedir()hit enter twice.</p>
<p>It’ll tell you where to place it.<br>
Usually, cache’s download to C: or user-directory<br>
You can always put your cache in with your client it will still work</p>
