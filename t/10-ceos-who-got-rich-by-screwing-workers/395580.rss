[i]The free market will deal with this. If paying directors large amounts of money is a bad idea then that poor financial decision making will be punished as the company is out competed.[/i]

Now that Frell is against tax cuts for the rich, I wonder,
Does he realise that over 70% of Americans agreed with him when this issue was being debated in Congress? Yet new tax cuts were still passed.
Do he begin to wonder if the so-called democratic system in America is failing ordinary people?
Did he know that two-thirds of all US corporations do not pay income tax?
Does he realise that President Obama has called for ending corporate tax loopholes in his campaign, the 2010 State of the Union and the 2011 State of the Union?
Is Frell prepared to get up and do something about this?

Students are often the only people with enough idealism and energy to do anything like this.

<p>Anyway, I don’t care anymore. I’ve returned the favour to Yakman with my own strong language just by replying here, and that’s good enough for me.</p>

              <p>It’s nothing to do with that. The first post reads as if it was made purely to call Frell out, and that’s crossing the line between healthy debate and being an arsehole.</p>
<p>Plenty of people here (Frell, Radeon, Mopar, myself) argue until they’re blue in the face about whatever they support (capitalism, the middle east, guns, etc), but nobody else has made a topic aimed at targeting an individual.</p>

              <p>Um, Frell openly discusses his views on the forum and seems willing to participate in these discussions. Yakman is continuing one with him.</p>
<p>I hardly see how that is him being against Free speech or anything like that. Don’t ever enter politics if you’re so easily rattled, Lothy.</p>

              <p>Yakman, why are you being a massive cunt to Frell? Yeah, he disagrees with you on some issues. He’s at liberty to do so, at least if you care about the freedoms and rights of Joe Citizen as much as you purport to.</p>
<p>If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that you’re all about free speech right up until the moment someone uses it to say something you don’t like.<br>
Do you know what that makes you? Full of shit.</p>
<p>The differences between you and those on the rich list you’ve posted here? Few and far between. In fact, probably only one – you got hit with the poor stick and they didn’t.</p>
