    <description>Ok i&#39;m trying to throw some things in that people have never seen: Example of one of them


Starting point: Law rune alter area

Since I havn&#39;t seen this in ANY server I think it will be a good idea. Please post feedback on this
If anyone else has some ideas for me i&#39;ll be glad to take them 
I will be releasing the source when I am done so if anyone is interested say so. Feel free to take this idea but give me some credit or atleast rep me  :P

-Thanks for reading ~Hydra117~
