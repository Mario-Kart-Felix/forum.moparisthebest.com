    <description>OK so I got this idea. Its going to be a sword but the thing is that its double bladed so you can take it apart and use it as a duel wield weapon. I was thinking you would need 99 smithing and maybe 100m or what ever in your server to split it or recombined it. So in a sense will be two weapons. This is my rough drawing of it.

School sucks, especially when you have an SAT due. I have one due every week for my media subject, so it is easy to understand your work load. Would you mind if i has a crack at trying the concept? I wouldn’t post it publicly, if you don’t want me to.[/quote]An SAT a week? Unless they are different in Australia, the SATs here in the states are used as a measure of where you are academically. Its a 5-6 hour long test, and you get scored in 3 separate sections, how you score greatly affecting on your likelihood of getting accepted into colleges. I took one in January, scoring a 1720 overall, and I’m taking it again in June <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>OT: The concept looks really cool, and the idea behind it can make it very versatile in a server! I’ve always loved the concepts of items being splittable/joinable, especially since I’ve made a set like that myself <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I can’t wait to see the finished result(s) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Also, I recommend a cyan and green theme, green for the majority of the blade, and cyan for the edges.</p>

No I really haven’t thought of a name for it but I’m willing to take ideas if anyone has one</p>

              <p>OK so I got this idea. Its going to be a sword but the thing is that its double bladed so you can take it apart and use it as a duel wield weapon. I was thinking you would need 99 smithing and maybe 100m or what ever in your server to split it or recombined it. So in a sense will be two weapons. This is my rough drawing of it.<br>
