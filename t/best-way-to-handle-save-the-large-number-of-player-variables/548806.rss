    <title>Best way to handle/save the large number of player variables?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-way-to-handle-save-the-large-number-of-player-variables/548806</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to start a discussion on the different ways to save and handle the large number of player variables that come with the territory when you start to develop content for a server. I&#39;m not talking about the variables every server has, like the username, PID, items, equipment, blah blah. I mean the variables that are little nuances that can really add up. Things that make you question whether or not it&#39;s worth it to even save the variable and hinder your content because of that.

[u]Things like:[/u]
Item attributes (player specific, like durability, timers for plant pots, etc)
Huge quantities of booleans for various things like tracking open world changes for instancing, counters for things like the coal trucks, etc
Quest tracking (if you do this properly it shouldn&#39;t take more than a few variables per quest, but with a hundred+ quests it still adds up)


Starting off the conversation, there are a few ways to handle this server sided without worrying about how you save them. The first way which is the most common practice is simply creating a large number of variables in a player/client class to keep track of everything. I find it ugly but I guess it is quite simple and easy to use and if done properly is technically the most reliable.

The second way I know of is to create a hashmap of &lt;String, Object&gt; where you simply think of a magic string and use it throughout all of your code when you want to find a variable.

For example, [tt]player.setVariable(&quot;seersCoalTruck&quot;, 15);[/tt] 

The idea works, but using magic strings is hard to maintain and bad practice.

A third way very similar to that is to use something like this:
[code]enum PlayerVariable {
 SEERS_COAL_TRUCK,
 WATERFALL_QUEST,
}[/code]
and use a map of &lt;PlayerVariable, Object&gt;
(this is virtually identically to creating a class of static string constants by the way, which accomplishes the same thing and could be easier to understand for new people)

A fourth way would be to create clusters of those previous types thus letting you be more specific with your implementation. This is what a lot of people would do automatically, for example they would have a cluster for item information which lets you easily find it when incrementing timers and such. But you would still need a more ambiguous one for the random variables you might run into.

If you have any other ideas feel free to bring those up too.
===

Now for saving, let&#39;s cover a few different ways people do that as well.

The first way is simple flat file saving which is probably the easiest to discuss. You go through, add another writeLine (or xml marker, or json whatever etc) for each variable, and you&#39;re done.

The way I really want to discuss is SQL saving, because no matter which way I choose to handle what I talked about above I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d save it all. I don&#39;t want to create new columns for everything, but I don&#39;t know if just having a table of string | value is good practice.</description>

              <p>Jagex probably does things server-sided the same way they do things client-sided. Load a byte for the data type, read data following. Stop reading when you reach type 255 or whatever. You can build off of this to have the smallest possible file sizes. Loading inventory? Type 25, maybe. Then each item has a type. 00 is a normal item - ID, assumed not stackable, so no extra 4 bytes needed for quantity. 01 might be stackable items, so ID then quantity. In your example, like with dealing with coal amounts, don’t store them until players actually deal with the coal carts. This way, a fresh player has a bare-bones save file. It’s extremely small and quick to load, although unfortunately you’d be forced to have ugly loading code. Small price to pay, though, as efficient systems aren’t as easy to write and deal with code-wise.</p>
<p>For quests, use bitmaps. No need to use more than a bit for flags, so quests should be minimal. In fact, for most quests all you would need is a single byte representing the quest step. Farm plots don’t have to have data once the area is back to its normal state - even so, each patch would only need a byte - that is, if you use the bits efficiently. Maybe use 2-3 bits for the plant state, another bit for if it’s diseased, another for dead, etc. You’ll probably need an extra byte or two for dealing with anything timer-related, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, just some thoughts. I only skimmed the thread so I apologize if I mentioned anything that was already covered. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I think a map is the only reasonable way to do it. There’s no other way that you can decorate a class with additional fields without either adding them in code or extending the class.</p>
<p>If you use a hashmap with a reasonable load factor (default 0.75 is probably fine) then it should be very close to O(1) lookup time. Still far slower than accessing a field in an object by a getter method, but that’s the tradeoff I guess.</p>
<p>The other approach is a composition approach. Essentially the player object references other objects (e.g.: PluginOne, PluginTwo, etc) which themselves encapsulate all fields relevant to the plugin. There’s an extra layer of indirection to get to the fields but it at least drastically reduces clutter within the Player class and mitigates the potential for it to become a god class.</p>

There’s no saveable annotation in Java?<br>
There’s one in the Eclipse IDE and whatnot, but not directly in Java…<br>
<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fui%2FSaveable.html%5B/quote%5D" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fui%2FSaveable.html[/quote]</a><br>
I know that, that’s why I was implying that you should make your own annotation <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[code=java]<span class="mention">@Retention</span>(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/target">@Target</a>(ElementType.FIELD)<br>
public <span class="mention">@interface</span> Saveable {</p>
<pre><code> public String value();
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>[code=java]<span class="mention">@Saveable</span>(“username”)<br>
private final String username;</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Saveable</span>(“password”)<br>
private final String password;</p>
<p><span class="mention">@Saveable</span>(“rights”)<br>
private Rights playerRights;[/code]</p>
<p>Then you can use the Reflection API to save and load values to and from the fields. I know I know, Reflection is “slow” but all disk I/O should be done on another thread anyway so it really doesn’t matter. I’m pretty sure Google GSON has inclusion and exclusion filters for serialization, so you can exclude all fields that don’t have the Saveable annotation. After thinking it over this isn’t very flexible though because this means that anything you want saved would have to be declared in the <span class="bbcode-i">Player</span> class (or in one of it’s superclasses?).</p>

Posting because I want to follow this topic…</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to find a more efficient way to handle my saving, and that’d include only saving variables I need (I had considered saving the player object directly to json, but that would save a ton of unneeded data).<br>
[/quote]<br>
could always just use an <span class="mention">@Saveable</span> annotation and then add inclusion/exclusion filters[/quote]</p>
<p>There’s no saveable annotation in Java?<br>
There’s one in the Eclipse IDE and whatnot, but not directly in Java…<br>

You are using the known dataset as a set of keys, but you could also do that with an enum of planets or whatever.

<p>I’m not saying an enum is the best choice here, I am still contemplating just using strings, but I’m trying to think of other ways too. Another nice thing about using enum though is that enummap is extremely efficient, pretty much just an array using enum ordinals.</p>

<p>Oh I see what you mean now, yeah. So either way I need to change how I load the variables, since right now it literally just loads all of them at login</p>

<p>Load interface/client settings at log in, and then stream the rest of them as they become available from your db</p>

<p>Yeah, the config/setting/varp/etc. values contain a lot (if not most) of a player’s saved game state.[/quote]</p>

<p>You could assume there are possibly unused varps for objects/interfaces and those would actually hold information about the player. But possibly they also join that information with skill levels, etc</p>
