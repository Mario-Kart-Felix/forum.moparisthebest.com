I think U.S.A because no matter what War we have been in so far we won the majority of them, that and we have advanced training and technolgy that other poor countrys lack.<br>
[/quote]<br>
We have won every war so far. Considering you don’t count Vietnam as a loss, and Iraq still in progress.</p>
<p>Btw, no offence to you brits or brit lovers or british supporters. But you guys failed in the American Revolution. :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Your forgetting that the brits ruled most of the world at that time. Our empire was spread out over the whole of the world. And your happy cause you beat a small proportion of us?</p>

              <p>Military speaking, the agreement between Russia and the US to put a cap on the amount of warheads is bad for Russia. Russia’s warheads are powerful, but inaccurate. You’ve probably heard of the Tsar Bomb. I know it’s a propaganda bomb, but it shows that Russia can make really powerful warheads, as long as they don’t have to be accurate. The US on the other hand, has relatively weak warheads that are very accurate.</p>
<p>Russia has the least amount of troops. Then the US, and China has the most soldiers. I guess that China is stronger then you’d expect. They have a lot of tanks and other armored vehicles. Their airforce isn’t that great yet, but they have some nice planes under development.</p>

I don’t know about after Obamas and Medvedevs new agreement, but before that the Russians had many more warheads than the Americans.</p>

<p>You totally under estimate Chinas technology. They use infantry to show off their powers and their belief in “strength in numbers”, but that belief also goes for there Navy, Airforce and Armour. China has technology that not even the USA has, and I beleive they would fuck up Russia so hardcore, and could probaly beat the USA if it were one on one. But of course, Europe would back the US because we seem to like being racist.[/quote]<br>
If the Russians fight in China, the Chinese might win, but if the Chinese invade Russia, I think the extreme temperature/landscape might contribute toward an [extremely close] Russian victory.</p>
