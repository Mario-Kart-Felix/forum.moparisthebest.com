    <description>Ok.....What number do you put in the port thingy? I want to play with other players...not only me! I changed my IP, like for example, :127.0.0.1 (which is the one I&#39;ve been playing on for today which I want to play with my friends) Also when I want to change my character into a girl, when i try to click accept, it just keeps the selection screen there. So please reply to help me. Thank You. :confused: :)[br][size=1]Posted on: January 07, 2007, 03:10:34 PM[/size][hr]Please answer people...I need some help...</description>
