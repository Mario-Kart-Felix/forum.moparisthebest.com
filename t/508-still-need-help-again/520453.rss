    <title>508 still need help again</title>

    <description>Hello..

I recently redid the shop system in the 508 server I am using to use the actual shop interfaces. Ever since then though, it is taking a very long time to get to a point where my client actually &#39;connects to update server.&#39; Could it be the server trying to load all the shops first, probably? Maybe its just my very low RAM... 256mb idk... :S

Any way I might fix this to start up the server faster? (besides more RAM or buying a new computer)

I might add that eventually it loads the shops but comes up with this (i know the error and what it means, I&#39;m just having a little trouble):
