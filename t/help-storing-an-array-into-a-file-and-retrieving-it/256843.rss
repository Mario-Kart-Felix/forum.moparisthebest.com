    <title>Help storing an array into a file (and retrieving it)</title>

    <description>Ahh, popping my forum cherry. Hello wise oracles.

I have two large arrays (of 5000+ integers) which I would love to store into a file :-) and afterwards be able to fetch and manipulate again I&#39;ve been attempting to do so by saving them in little loops of integer by integer, but seem to not be doing this very reliably (especially the retrieving / manipulating business). Am I missing an easy and obvious command related to arrays and files?
Furthermore I&#39;d have about 25 (or 50!) of these files, so I&#39;m not really willing to consider non(automated)file solutions as per hassle that this scripts life purpose is to avoid. (do not want to declare and use 50 different arrays (or 250000 integers for that matter :D)
Thank you for any attempts, hints and lost thoughtcycles. I&#39;m hitting the hay now, as you are tonights last resort... will be back in 12 hours after some office slavery. (I enjoy bracketed text --&gt;)</description>
