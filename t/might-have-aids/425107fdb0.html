He had done this numerous times before and he always enjoyed doing it…but for some reason, this time, she smelled really horrible, and she tasted even worse. He didn’t want to offend her though because he hadn’t seen her in months…so he put a Jolly Rancher in his mouth to cover it up, even though it didn’t do much to help.<br>
In the course of eating her out, he accidentally pushed the candy inside of her… and stuck a finger in to grab it out. He took it out, and put it back into his mouth and bit it. Only…it wasn’t the Jolly Rancher.<br>
It was a nodule of gonorrhea.<br>
As in, the blister-like structure that gonorrhea makes filled with diseased pus was the size of a fucking Jolly Rancher and the poor guy BIT it. I guess it was really dark in the room. He freaked out and started vomiting all over the place when it exploded in his mouth…<br>
He demanded to know what was going on, turns out she had cheated on him at a club like, the first week of college, and fucked some random guy and the stupid bitch had no clue what was wrong with her. She noticed a strange smell though.<br>
So now, Steve is freaking out that he now has gonorrhea of the mouth and God knows what else.[/quote]jesus christ o.O</p>

I’m not targeting you when I say this, but I tend to see people that drink a ton and are completely reckless tend to be the less intelligent members of society. Honestly, there is plenty of fun in life without being a “rebellious teenager” (and even if you must, there are <span class="bbcode-i">safe</span> ways of doing so). When you take things to the extreme, it’s just plain stupid.</p>
<p>David is simply intelligent compared to his peers. It’s not a matter of having a social life or not, it’s a matter of being stupid or not.<br>
[/quote]<br>
True, people <span class="bbcode-b">should </span>logically strive to be the best that they can be but our progression in evolution has changed from what it used to be. It seems that our society dictates us in a fashion which makes us want to always to gain something if not physical items, knowledge, experience and so forth. It dictates us to do this so that we can distract ourselves our whole lives trying to gain more then waste time by amusing ourselves for short periods of time and repeat the cycle. Since this is our lets say curse that we have trapped ourselves in why should we strive to be the best of the best when you can work a little less and still be just as if not more content(obviously there are variables that apply to this).<br>
So being a less intelligent member of society isn’t that bad, also humans aren’t really meant for the way we live(we only use a small % of our brain as we all know but every form of existence excluding the only ones that make us use most if not all of this amazing power we’ve been blessed with is pointless).<br>
Yes, there is plenty of fun indeed but you seem to have not realized what makes these things fun;o. For example I like to drink because I’m not myself for a while but knowing I’ll be the same person I was before, I’m confident in most situations, I usually have good company, I like cuddling and things like that and pretty much every time I’m drunk and most importantly I like to be happy. That isn’t trying to be a rebellious teen, being a rebellious teen would be doing something that doesn’t benefit themselves and that causes problems for others like lets say vandalism? Our existence is based on stupidity so that’s fine?<br>
Sorry about not really bringing my points together properly, never really been good at that I just have so many things I want to say and I try not to forget them or write too much.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ignorance is fine, but stupidity is not. I don’t call someone stupid if they can’t pass a test, but I will call them stupid if they beat their wife after their sports team loses. My point I made was more about how most people who drink young do it recklessly and emotionally, rather than logically. You’re right in suggesting society demands us to somehow gain something physical or emotional from everything we do, but that doesn’t mean it’s always logical. Society used to say it was fine to tar and feather a politician who publicly argued against monarchical rule. Is this logical? I consider those people that are tar and feathering the man to be complete morons and utterly stupid, because they are hurting another human being because it makes them feel better. Is it logical?</p>
<p>As for the brain power thing, I’m going to segway a bit. As far as my own limit understanding of the brain goes, I consider the “fractional brain power” concept to be completely stupid. If you actually look at MRIs of people thinking, they do indeed only use a part of their brain. Yet, if you look at different MRIs of people thinking different things, they are generally using a different part of their brain at any given moment. Another issue I have with the concept is that just because we aren’t using all of our brain doesn’t mean we have secretive potential of deeper thinking. It simply means we don’t need to utilize every function our brain offers at that given second. More does not always equal better, unlike what the maniacal American ideology suggests.</p>

Yes, there is plenty of fun indeed but you seem to have not realized what makes these things fun;o. For example I like to drink because I’m not myself for a while but knowing I’ll be the same person I was before, I’m confident in most situations, I usually have good company, I like cuddling and things like that and pretty much every time I’m drunk and most importantly I like to be happy. That isn’t trying to be a rebellious teen, being a rebellious teen would be doing something that doesn’t benefit themselves and that causes problems for others like lets say vandalism? Our existence is based on stupidity so that’s fine?<br>
Sorry about not really bringing my points together properly, never really been good at that I just have so many things I want to say and I try not to forget them or write too much.<br>

Couldn’t agree more, also if human beings actually utilized all of their brain power, we would be super humans, you would be able to make stuff float, and punch people in the face from across the room. We only use about 2% of our brain or 10% i forget which :P, see what we can do now? We create technology, go into space and observe other planets. If we used 100% We would be able to fly to other planets! (Am i making sense to you guys? XD)</p>

<p>Ignorance is fine, but stupidity is not. I don’t call someone stupid if they can’t pass a test, but I will call them stupid if they beat their wife after their sports team loses. My point I made was more about how most people who drink young do it recklessly and emotionally, rather than logically. You’re right in suggesting society demands us to somehow gain something physical or emotional from everything we do, but that doesn’t mean it’s always logical. Society used to say it was fine to tar and feather a politician who publicly argued against monarchical rule. Is this logical? I consider those people that are tar and feathering the man to be complete morons and utterly stupid, because they are hurting another human being because it makes them feel better. Is it logical?</p>
<p>As for the brain power thing, I’m going to segway a bit. As far as my own limit understanding of the brain goes, I consider the “fractional brain power” concept to be completely stupid. If you actually look at MRIs of people thinking, they do indeed only use a part of their brain. Yet, if you look at different MRIs of people thinking different things, they are generally using a different part of their brain at any given moment. Another issue I have with the concept is that just because we aren’t using all of our brain doesn’t mean we have secretive potential of deeper thinking. It simply means we don’t need to utilize every function our brain offers at that given second. More does not always equal better, unlike what the maniacal American ideology suggests.[/quote]<br>
Sorry but i’m tired and not in the mood for this although you have valid points but a short reply to what you said:<br>
first paragraph, I think we’re having a communication issue cause I don’t understand what your trying to say.<br>
second paragraph, its not all about the brain your thinking about its current potential… See my theory which is pretty viable in my opinion is that when more of it is used it will cause the body and mind to further evolve to be at a stage where its capacity is 100x(or whatever) of what our capacity is right now. Obviously this can’t happen the way we live atm but look at existence, its truly amazing. It doesn’t make sense how everything came to be so then things we think are near impossible clearly mustn’t be as we are all impossible to our current understanding.</p>
