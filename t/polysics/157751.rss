    <description>Hey I have a thing for this type of music (I remember someone, i think paulT posted something along the lines of chu chu lovely muri muri kura kura prin prin boron bla bla bla, but i really loved that song)

Anyways i found another band which is sort of like JROCKish
take a listen to there song &quot;Electric Surfin Go Go&quot;

They call themselves &quot;Polysics&quot; and there lyrics are sometimes english, sometimes japanese and sometimes random jibberish

Here is a link to their myspace (thanks to my friend) and the song playing as soon as you visit it is electric surfin go go.

So tell me what you guys think, and if you have any similar type of bands that i would enjoy =D</description>
