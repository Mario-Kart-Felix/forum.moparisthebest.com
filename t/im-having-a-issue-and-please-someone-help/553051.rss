While correct (especially about the IDE, I recommend anyone use one no matter your skill level), I believe that the warnings can be put off momentarily while the OP learns more about the language.<br>

</aside>
<p>That compiler you showed me was for the client, I can tell because the server doesn’t have non-refactored naming (Class30_Sub whatever).</p>
<p>You didn’t say there was an issue with the server.<br>
You showed us a picture of a compiler with no explanation and asking for help.<br>
I, nor anyone else, can guess what you want help with or what you’re trying to accomplish.<br>
You must explain that to us in the greatest detail you can, including what you’ve tried. That way we can figure out what you’re doing wrong and point you to the right direction.</p>
<p>You need to run the server first, and wait for it to be online, and then run the client.</p>
