    <title>How does 508 work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-does-508-work/266429</link>
    <description>How does 508 work? My friend told me it&#39;s cool because it has the current RS graphics. So i&#39;m thinking about setting one up, but i&#39;ve only been able to script for czar so far, (or 317 idk if all 317&#39;s is like czar). So is 508 anything like czar?

I just wanna know if it would take me a long time to figure how to use it and code for it.</description>
