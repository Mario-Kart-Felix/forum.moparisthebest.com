    <title>Setting up PS3 with new hard drive/HDMI cable</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-ps3-with-new-hard-drive-hdmi-cable/551922</link>
    <description>As the title says, I&#39;m trying to set up my PS3 with a new hard drive, but I have a pretty big problem. The default video setting for the PS3 is AV (component cable), which I do not have. All I have to use for the video display is an HDMI cable. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to use the method of holding down the power button to switch the video mode to the native monitor settings, most likely because the hard drive has not been set up yet. The only way I can do that is if I have a visual, and I cannot do that unless I can switch the video mode to HDMI some other way.

Is there any possible way to prepare a hard drive without even using the PS3?</description>

              <p>[quote=“Fridder, post:2, topic:551922”]Are you able to use your prior hard drive and hold the power button for 2 beeps? Or try taking out the hard drive entirely, because it doesn’t rely on anything inside the hard drive in order for the PS3 to boot up. As for the power button forcing HDMI, that deals with the PS3’s internal memory and has nothing to do with the hard drive. Try using that power key trick a few times.</p>

Thanks for the help, but I’ve had no avail with the button trick. I’m just going to end up getting an AV cable and see what I can do with it.</p>
