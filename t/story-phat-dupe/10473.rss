    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/story-phat-dupe/10473</link>
    <description>Barefoot Girl found this on RS forums in the school year.

~Authors Note~ 

This is one of the most famous true stories of all time. It actully took place back in Runscape Classic. But for entertainment value, I will make it be In Runescape 2. 

This story tells of a player, who so desperatly wanted a Party hat, that he was willing to hack into JAgex to get one. 

But his greed took him to far, and ultimately he was faced with great punishment. 

Here, I present to you, the most famous Story in Runescape History. 

The &quot;Phat Duplicating&quot; 


Note:Names in this story are made up... I have also added some fictional real life events just to add enterainment to the story. 
John sunk into his computer chair, booted it up, and logged into Runescape.. 

His account name was Run3 Patri0t. And He was a solid level 90. He would walk around, owning all in his full rune with dragon skimmy. 

You would think level 90 would give you respect? 

But no, he was constantly laughed at by all the other level 90s with barrows and party hats. He was laughed at by the level 50s wearing there yellow party hats that they got from a illegal drop trade off there main. 

John was bored. He hit a nice 22 on a level 70 pure in the duel arena. The level 70 screamed, &quot;Noob!&quot; Then died, and he was returned to the duel arena. 

There was a level 90 with full dragon. It costed nearlty 25 Mil+! 

John had good skills. He had a overall level of 1400+, and he had lots of quest points... 

But the secret to being rich evaded him. He walked up the the guy in full dragon. 

&quot;How did you get that?&quot; He asked. 

&quot;L0l n00b figur3 it out.&quot; The man said, he did the laugh emote, and walked away. 

John spit in real life as he drank some soda as he clicked follow. 

He followed the level 90 in full dragon who responded with a, 

&quot;Wdf noob?&quot; 

John sighed and walked away, he pmed his friend. 

&quot;How do you get rich?&quot; 
His friend didnt reply very quickly. And for a second John thought he ignored him all together. 
&quot;Beats me. go fish some sharks.&quot; 

John had the requirments to fish sharks, so he did. 

He fished 200 sharks before getting bored.. 

He cooked them, burnt 50 of them, and sold the rest for 150k. 

This had to go. John could no longer stand being the poor level 90. John would get rich anyway he could. 

John might of not knew it at that time, but he was about to begin the biggest scandel in Jagex history. 
John played runescape for another 3 hours. He mostly played 8 hours a day. He felt as if he had no life. He was unathletic, knew nothing about sports, and as he thought, very unattrative. Not even in Runescape could he get any respect or love. 

John went to school that day, he sat with his nerd group, got picked on as usual, and wizzed through class. When he got home he booted up Runescape as usual.. 

It was time to break the mystery of the Party hat. 

He created a thread in general fourms of runescape titled, 

&quot;How do u get phat?&quot; 

A guy posted and said, 

&quot;Wrong fourms dude. Try Items?&quot; 

John replied, &quot;Thanks.&quot; 

But then four more wannabe mods began posting things like, 

&quot;Read fourms rules. Please direct your post to Item fourms.&quot; 

And &quot;SPam! I eat Spam. Please do not spam. Thanks 
-K25robert &quot; 

John sighed and posted the same thread in the items fourms. 

No help.. 

&quot;Lol noob, work hard.&quot; One person posted. 

&quot;Rofl noob, I got mine when it came out.&quot; Another posted. 
John shook his head, he bumped his thread because people lost intrest in it. 

&quot;Fish sharks?&quot; One person posted. 

&quot;I tried that too boring.&quot; John replied. 

&quot;Well try killing Dragons or something.&quot; The same person posted. 

John couldn&#39;t do that, his range and mage were only levels 60-70. 

&quot;Lol maybe you should hack jagex and steal all there party hats!&quot; Another person posted. 

John chuckled at this, it was impossible to hack Jagex. A second later a mod came and hid the post. 
After a while John gave up and roamed Runescape pointlessly. He went to the fight pits and did well until a level 100 with full Veracs and a whip owned him. 

&quot;Noob rune at 90 lolz?&quot; The 100 said as John died. 

John was at a breaking point. He would have a party hat, he would have barrows. He would have everything. 

Finally, he would get respect! 
Respect didnt come at school... 

John was laughed at, joked at, poked at, cursed at, almost every possible thing. John ignored it all and just kept in the back of his mind that Runescape would soon come. 

Jack got home and booted up Runescape, and he set to work. He was going to break the secret of party hat. 

&quot;Hack JAgex..&quot; A voice in the back of his mind said. John thought this was a joke at first, but he figured people hacked the Pentagon so why not Jagex? 

John rembered watching a movie about a young man who hacked the Pentagon. they say you have to be one of the mose intelligent people in the world to do such a thing. 

When you hack the Pentagon the F.B.I will come after you. They will either put you in prision for 30 years, or offer you a job. 

John knew nothing about hacking, and so he ran a search engine on it. He read about it, and for days he sat in his room learning about hacking codes, and open ports, and other things of that type. 

John learned how to do a keylogger, and he posted one on a Runescape Fansite. 

He created a thread &quot;Omg free party hat click here!&quot; 

He then posted a link that had a key logger. A key logger allowed you to see everything that people typed. Posting free party hat would make many people click his link. 

Soon he got many peoples (codewords). He logged in too many of them and shook his head. 

They were all levels 60 and below! Nobody was dumb enough to fall for this trick. 

John frowned and deleted all the accounts friends list he had hacked, then gave away all there noob items just to be hateful. 
John knew that key logging would never work.. And the thought of hacking still entered his mind.... 

He would hack Jagex! But how? 

From what John leanred, each item had a code. 

The code standed for the items stats, picture, and all aspects of that Item. 

John learned that by altering the code, he could change the item, or even turn it into a diffrent Item. 

For Example: John could make a Rune skimmy have a special like a dragon dagger! He could make his Dragon skimmy posioned. 

So if a rune skimmy had a item code of: (2,364) and he changed it to (2364.2) witch stood for the D daggers posion. He would have a posion skimmy! 

But John needed to hack into the databases of Jagex to change the item codes for the items he possesed. 

John would need help with his, and so, thats where his friend came in.. 
John walked to the library down the road. There he saw Corey. 

Corey was a hacker, he even told people he was. Corey had once hacked into the school Grade Database and gave himself all As, and he also gave a person he hated faling grades. 

John was not good friends with Corey. Corey was athletic and Popular, unlike John. But Corey still had a love for computers, and it seemed no matter how nerdy that was, if Corey could still throw 3 Touchdowns a game, It didnt matter. 

John walked up to Corey, &quot;Hey&quot; He said. 

Corey didn&#39;t give him a glance, &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;I need your help.&quot; 

Corey smiled, as he typed away on his keyboard, he looked up. 

&quot;With what?&quot; He asked. 

&quot;Hacking.&quot; John replied. 

Corey&#39;s eyes lit up, and he smiled, &quot;You came to the right man...&quot; 

So John told Corey about hacking into Runescape. Corey didn&#39;t play Runescape himself, but he agreed to hack it. He would enjoy hacking anything. John thought that one day Corey would hack the Pentagon... 
After about a week of nothing, John got a (Fone) call. 

&quot;I&#39;ve done it!&quot; Corey said, &quot;Come down to my house.&quot; 

John did, and he entered. He said hi to Corey&#39;s dad and walked up the stairs. There was pictures of the New York Giants football team everywhere in Corey&#39;s room. 

On the wall it said, &quot;Giants to Miami 06-07&quot; 

John walked up to Corey. All he saw was a bunch of numbers on the screen. 

&quot;What is this?&quot; John asked. 

&quot;This?&quot; Corey said, &quot;This is all the items in the game. Every stat for every character, every item for every character. Everything! Here I can make that one guy..&quot; Corey paused, &quot;Whats his name? The guy with 99 everything?&quot; 

&quot;Zezima&quot; I told him. 

&quot;Yeah that nerd. I can make him level 3!&quot; 

John smiled, he had broke the secret of the party hat. Soon he would get the respect he dserved. 
&quot;Ok corey, I want 6 trillion Gold, One thousand Dragon skimmys, 500 Whips, 25 sets of full rune, 500 Party hats of every color, 300 Santa Hats, 100 sets of every Barrows, 500 Sets of Full dragon, 1,000 Ammy of Fury..&quot; 
[br][size=1]Posted at: August 21, 2006, 02:38:44 PM[/size][hr]&quot;WHOA!&quot; Corey said, &quot;Slow down, I just hacked into Runescape, I don&#39;t know all the item codes yet. Write them down for me, and I will make sure you have the items by tommarow.&quot; 

John nodded, and he did. He couldnt wait to play tommarow! 

John logged in the next day, there was a new update that said. 

New update! ! Andrew Gower is a Mama&#39;s Boy! ! ! John scratched his head, &quot;What the hell?&quot; 

He clicked the update link. It read: 

Today Andrew Gower was off drinking his tea like a stupid britt moron with his mama. His mama gave him a hug and he said &quot;I love you Mommy!&quot; Andrew gower is a loser, and Runescape is now called Apescape. 

P.S.:LOLOLOL N00B JAG3X I HACK3DC U L0L *33BS GO TO HELL. I HAVE A RASH.... 

John unclicked the link, sure enough, where it used to say Runescape, It said Apescape. and beside it was a picture of a one eyed monkey floating on a baloon with a hand grenade in his right hand. 
&quot;Oh no!&quot; John said, &quot;Corey has taken this too far!&quot; 

John logged into runescape. The loading screen had a big monkey on it, and it said, &quot;Apescape.&quot; 

When John logged in it said, &quot;Welcome to Apescape.&quot; 

John went to his bank, he didnt have none of the items he asked for! 

Suddenly someone walked up to him, &quot;WDF? ? YOU ARE LEVEL 563! ! ARE YOU THE GUY THAT HACKED RUNESCAPE?&quot; 

John looked at his level and laughed! He was level 563, he had 6,000 Strength, 2,000 Attack, 5,000 Defence, 4,000 Magic, 2,000 range, 4,000 hitpoints, 999.999999999 billion Prayer! 

&quot;HOLY HELL!&quot; John screamed in real life. He noticed he was wearing some wired armor. 

He looked at his iventory, he had a huge sword, he moved his mouse over it. 

Ub3r Ownag3 Sword 

John looked at its bonus 

99999999999999999999+ Slash 
99999999999999999999+ Thrust 
99999999999999999999+ Crush 
99999999999999999999+ Strength 

He examined it, 

Heres ur big uber sword, have fun. 
-Corey 

His armor was even more impressive 

He had a full set of armor named, 

Ub3r Armor 

It gave him 

999999999999999999999999999999 in all defence bonus. 

John laughed and dueled someone, He attacked them and hit a 99! ! Instantly a huge shockwave exploded from John, and all the other players in the duel arena were instantly killed, and there accounts were deleted! 

John was now byhimself at the duel arena. Anyone he killed with this sword would have there account deleted! 

John smiled, suddenly a level 50 noob walked up, 

&quot;I buy ur sword 5k&quot; 

John laughed, he would delete this noob if they duled. Suddenly John noticed something, he could attack the noob even though they werent in the duel arena! ! ! 

He hit a 99 on the noob, and the noob was deleted. 
John laughed, now he could kill people anywhere, NOw.. 

HE WOULD HAVE RESPECT! ! 
John noticed his sword had a special. He was almost scared to see what it did. John began to roam Runescape. So many people were following him that John just killed them. 

Suddenly John saw a guy in Full Veracs with whip. It was the guy that owned him in the fight pits! Then to top it off, he called John a rune noob! 

The guy said, &quot;Wdf? I remember you noob!&quot; 

John decided he would use the speical attack on him. Suddenly a huge 99 appeared on the screen, and everything the guy in full Veracs had in his bank was transfered to Johns inventory! 

The guy died, and John picked up the full veracs. He noticed that his special bar did not go down. Maybe it was unlimited? 

John got a (Fone Call) It was corey. 

&quot;Having fun?&quot; Corey asked. 

&quot;You bet!&quot; John said, as he hit another 99 on a guy. 

&quot;I added a special gift for anyone who you use that speical on.&quot; 

&quot;I know, I got all of a guys bank items.&quot; 

John heard Corey laugh on the other line. 

&quot;No you nerd. I could care less about bank items and junk like that. I added the bank item thing for you to have fun with. I simply made it so when you used a special on a guy, It would hack into the guys Java and delete it. So he would have to download more java to play Apescape. I also made it so it would follow the guys open computer ports, and give him a super computer worm I made up. Not to mention a keylogger so I can get all the guys (codewords) for anything else he uses. Like maybe his (Codeword) for his bank account? How fun! Well, I got to get back to work. &quot; 

Then Corey said bye and hung up. 

John wondered what Corey was up to now? 

He didnt care, he was having too much fun with his uber hack character. 
So John continued to own all with his uber sword. One day John logged in and saw that his uber helm was replaced with a Party hat! 
But it wasent a noraml party hat. It was a multicolored party hat, It was like all the colors of the party hat put in one. 

When John examined it, it said: 

Enjoy 
-Corey your freindly neighborhood Hacker 

John smiled. John decided to fish, and since his fishign was 899983828, he would fish 28 sharks in 5 seconds. Jack decided he would give away free sharks. 

John entered the fourms and decided to stop by general fourms to chat before going to food. 

Suddenly he saw a sticky on the top of the fourms that said, &quot;Run3 Patri0t Spottings&quot; 

John smiled, Run3 patri0t was the name of his account! He clicked on the thread, it was by Andrew Gower! 

It has come to our attention here at JAgex that a account named &quot;Run3 Patri0t&quot; Has somehow hacked into the Jagex Database and created new dangerous items that not only take all your items, but delete your account! If you ever see him, simply logged out quickly. If you ever see run3 patri0t. Please quickly post here, and warn other players not to use that world. 

We here at Jagex are working quickly to remove him from the game. But first we need to gain acess to our databases again that allow us to ban accounts. 

-Andrew 

John went to the food fourms, he posted: Free sharks. 

A person posted: Omg you are the hacker! ! I dont want my account deleted. 

John shook his head, and returned to the general fourms. Andrew gower&#39;s post was gone and was replaced with the thread name: 

&quot;I like pie&quot; 

John clicked on it and it said: 

My name is Andrew gower! And I am a idiot, I like pie alot and i love to eat pie with my mama because im a stupid british moron! 

P.S: Dear Jagex, I now have control of Runescape, just give it up, and stop wasting your time. 

Also, l0l0l *33bs i hack3d yo candy mornoic idiots hahahah n00bs 

John frowned, Corey was taking this too far. 
One day John logged in and was walking towards Lumbridge. When all the sudden he got a message on his chat box. 
Heads up 
-Corey 

Suddenly John saw 5 level 6,000 Monsters in front of him. They were named: Ub3r Dragons. 

It was horrible! Corey had placed these monsters here at the Lumbridge square so when anyone died, they would be respawned at lumbrdige, then instanly killed again. The dragons were hitting 99s! Anytime anyone respawned they died again instnatly, then respawned and instaly killed agiain, it was never ending! 

John figured he did this at the Falador respawn point too.. 

Suddenly the dragons began hitting 99s on John. John had 4,000 hitpoints though and he charged at the Dragons. 

Suddenly he saw new items appear in his inventory. 

Ub3r Potions 
&quot;Big foots&quot; Cooked feet 
Ur Moms cooked hair 


John drank a Ub3r potion and it multiplied all his combat stats by two! He ate the foot of Sasquatch and it restored his hp completly! 

But the dragons were strong, they kept hitting constant 99s on him. John struck back by hittings 150s. Eventully the Dragons were killed. 

Finally people could respawn again without getting instant killed by the dragons. 

&quot;Ty mate.&quot; A level 89 said. 

&quot;N.P&quot; John replied as he hit a 99 on the 89 and deleted his account. 

John laughed, he was having too much fun in Corey&#39;s Version of Runescape. 

Little did he know the fun would soon end. 
John stopped by the library to get a book he needed to do his history project before he got home. There he saw corey sitting in the back corner reading some sports book about Barry Bonds doing Steriods. 

John approached him. Corey looked up from his book and smiled, &quot;I swear, Barry didn&#39;t take beefroids! This guy is a 100% Natural World Class hitter. Can&#39;t wait untill he breaks Hank Aarons record. Did you know Barry once told the Media to go f itself?&quot; Corey laughed at this. 

&quot;I need to talk to you about Runesc-&quot; John was interuppted by corey. 
Corey wagged his finger, &quot;Ahem?&quot; 

&quot;Apescape..&quot; John muttered. 

&quot;Ok? What is it you wish to know about Apescape?&quot; 

&quot;I think your taking it too far. I never wanted one hit kills, and weapons that delete people&#39;s accounts and put keyloggers on there computers. I just wanted a party hat.&quot; 

Corey moaned, &quot;ugh.. You don&#39;t see the entire picture. I&#39;m just doing this for practice. You know how fun it is to keep that stupid Andrew Gower Brittish moron from his own game?&quot; 

John shooked his head, &quot;You need to give Jagex back it&#39;s database and return Runescape the way it was Corey. Runescape is just no more fun! People are starting to cancel there membership. Hell! You deleted half of the members yourself! Without membership Runescape gets no funds, no funds means runescape can&#39;t pay to keep itself on the web. Corey! You are killing runescape!&quot; 

Corey laughed, &quot;Who cares?&quot; And he placed the book on the library and walked out. 

John balled his fists. He was going to end this. And there was only one way possible. 

Steal Apescape from Corey. Jack was going to hack Corey and steal the site from him... 

Jack would end it now.. 
And so John began learning all about Hacking. He learned all about the viruses John could put on peoples computers such as, Bombs, Trojans, Worms, and other things of that type. He learned all about open computer ports and how to acess them. 

But John understood Corey was in a league of his own when it came to hacking. 

One day Corey went to &quot;Apescape.&quot; 

On the new update page it said: 

This new update page is now a Barry Bonds update page! Will Barry bonds pass Hank Aaron? Find out? Also I am now deleting 5,000 Random peoples Account for fun. Enjoy! 

Beside the one eyed monkey on a baloon with a hand grenade it said, &quot;Bonds 4 Life!&quot; 

John shook his head, he looked forward to returning Runescape back to normal. 
He began to try and hack back into the Database. After 3 hours he finally got to a page that read: 

&quot;Insert (Codeword) to continue.&quot; 

John began to run his (Codeword) hacking program that would automatically run every possible combination of a 5 letter (Codeword) there could be. 

The (Codeword) program took 5 hours, and John stayed up all night eating potatoe chips and drinking soda. Suddenly he heard a beep on his computer. 

He walked over and it said: 

What the hell are you trying to do n00b hacker? 
-Corey 

Suddenly A window popped up. It was a huge smiley face that said, &quot;You are a Idiot! You are a idiot! HA HA HA HA HA! ! YOU are A idiot! You are a idiot! HA HA HA HA HA! ! &quot; 

John shook his head and went to close the window by clicking the &quot;X&quot; button. 

The Window began to move so fast John could not click it. 

So John hit Control, Alt, Delete, and hit close window. 

BAM! 

The windows multiplied, and now there were two windows calling John a idiot. John kept trying to close them but they kept multiplying. Soon there were 5,000 Windows calling John a idiot! John&#39;s entire computer locked up quickly after that... 

John banged his fist on his desk. 

&quot;This is not over yet Corey! I will get Runescape back! ! ! &quot; 
John went to school and sat with his nerd group as usual. At the end of the day he bumped into Corey. 

Corey turned around and saw John. Corey just laughed so hard he was almost in tears, &quot;YOU! ! ? ? YOU! ! You trying to hack me? ? HAHAHAH!&quot; Corey laughed as he walked down the hallway and met up with his &quot;Double D&quot; Blonde girlfriend at his locker. 
Later that night John stayed up all night. He ran his (Codeword) Hacking program on Corey&#39;s Database again. Once again the same message popped up: 

What the Hell are you trying to do n00b Hacker? 
-Corey 

The Smiley face popped up again and called John a Idiot. 

&quot;Oh Shove it!&quot; John snapped, as he hit Controll Alt delete close window. The windows began multiplying again, but John kept hitting controll Alt delete like crazy. 

After like 30 minutes of closing windows, the windows finally stopped mulitplying! John had closed the idiot smiley faces, and he was now in Corey&#39;s Database! 

&quot;Look at all this!&quot; John said to himself. 

On the list was all kinds of numbers for all the deleted players, all the weapons John had, and all kinds of crazy stuff. 

John deleted many of the codes, hoping that it would Undelete many Runescape players. He thin changed the main title page back to runescape. 

On the update page he wrote: 

&quot;Corey Is Gaiy! ! &quot; 

He then wrote: 

Corey loves BArry bonds! Corey likes Barry bonds the loser who did steriods to win! Corey is a lame hacker, and He is nothing compred to the great me! ! ! Go to hell Corey, Andrew Gower rocks, go Brittish! 

P.S: N00b I hack3d u l0l n00b hack3r c0r3y? 

John was happy with this message, and soon he signed off the web to do his homework. 

The (Fone) Rang... 

John picked it up, &quot;Hello?&quot; 

&quot;You will pay for this! Go to hell!&quot; Corey&#39;s voice snapped on the other line. And Corey hung up.. 

John layed back in his bed, he felt good. 

He had hacked Corey, and proved Corey wasen&#39;t as good as he thought...</description>

              <p>It happened alot differently back in rsc times.</p>
<p>Phats were only worth a couple mills, pink (now known as purple) was the most valuable before the  duping. Since they were the rarest they were obviously duped more… Making them the most common, like now.</p>
<p>It happened with Auto Rune btw, and “Corey” and “John” didn’t figure it out.</p>
