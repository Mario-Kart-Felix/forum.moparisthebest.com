              <p>Went to a firework outlet today, picked up some Excalibur and Black Mamba artillery shells/cakes/a bunch of other fountain bags, bottle rockets, roman candles, etc. The bill ended up to be about $300, which will not happen next year lol, but after some bargaining on the expensive artillery shells we got the bill down to $200 ($206 to be exact).</p>
<p>Since no further discussion is wanted in this thread, I guess I’ll lock it.</p>

<p>I’m heading to a fireworks shop tomorrow morning to see if I can get my hands on some cakes without a permit. The person I am going with has done it, so hopefully it’ll happen again.

<p>The weather is being a pain in the ass and I probably won’t even be able to light them off until Thursday, but hopefully it’ll be Wednesday like I have planned for a few days.</p>

<p>Do you live in town? If you’re in the country, fuck the law :P. Wisconsin has similar laws (E.G. You need a permit to possess and handle fireworks), but I light them off in the middle of the country with like 2 neighbors that could care less.</p>
<p>My dad is going to try and call a few places today to see if we actually have to BRING the permit in and show the counter to purchase Class B fireworks(Cakes, Firecrackers, etc.). Hopefully my dad will only have to show ID to purchase them, because there is no way in hell I am paying $50 for a permit to light off like 65-70 fireworks.[/quote]<br>
Its a small-town, with cops who are power-hungry, and if you give them an inch, they’ll take that inch, and stretch it another mile and a half. Not directly in town, but not far from. Wish I did live in the country though, because my mom (who lives in mississippi), could ship us up some big stuff to launch off. But alas, we are “firework-less” anyways today, so its all good <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
