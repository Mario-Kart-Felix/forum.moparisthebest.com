They are more then fair.</p>
<p>They’ve been known to give second chances to some autoer’s and whatnot. You shouldn’t get a second chance because it’s your responsibility to read and understand the rules.<br>

FAIR!!!???I got an offence for sayin “poof”!!!When I appieled they ignored me!!!<br>
I wrote them askin how poof is a cus word and they repled tellin me that they know i was on my acount at the time!!!WDF???I know that too!!!Those jackasses comepletely ignored me!!![/quote]</p>
<p>You’re posting on a cheating site, so the odds are you’ve broke a rule somewhere along the lines. And regarding their customer service… Yeah it does suck, but when you make an account you agree to their terms, and they don’t owe you anything more than stated.</p>

theres NOTHING wrong with saying POOF<br>
