              <p>Well i do know what i’m talking about and i’m just guessing he’s got wireless internet because he is having this error!!! Same exact thing happened to me and i realized i had to port forward, and obviously if u have a router u don’t need to port forward but i’m assuming he has wireless internet because he needs this help!!!</p>

<p>First off no-ip has nothing to do with port forwarding, that is just making a different ip instead of ur computers one, and port forwarding allows people to go through ports to access his computer and play on his server, and he obviously can’t post his server status if his server isn’t on, it won’t allow it. Don’t tell me i don’t know what i’m talking about, i had the same problem until i port forwarded.</p>

</aside>
<p>Obiously you “dont” know what your talking about, and yes no-ip does NOT have<br>
anything to do with port forwarding, but if you have no-ip you dont need to port forwards,<br>
because you would of know that you didn’t have a router and wouldn’t of needed to port forwards. If you have a modem you dont need to do it, but if you have a router then what do<br>
you think you would of needed to do?</p>
