    <title>[508]: New death animation, or classic wilderness Animation (317)?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-new-death-animation-or-classic-wilderness-animation-317/254812</link>
    <description>I&#39;m thinking about which I should have as my death animation.

My 508 is a pking server, therefore I want it to feel as much as the old RuneScape wilderness as possible. Should I have the old animation or the New one?

I&#39;d like your opinions if thats ok ;).

Thanks in advance.</description>
