Tired of getting banned from servers for griefing and stealing? What about getting muted for spamming and using all caps? Well, look no further, because this server is the right choice for you!

Trancedkuja&#39;s Anarchy Server!

Here on Trancedkuja&#39;s Anarchy Server, you have freedom to do whatever you please, (Excluding just 3 rules). Grief, steal, spam, use all caps, you name it; It&#39;s what makes this server different from many other servers you play on.

Rules

Yes, there are only 3 rules, but they are pretty simple and easy to follow.

1. Hacking of any kind is NOT permitted; this includes x-ray, aimbot, flying, and vice versa. (Permanent Jail or Permanent Ban)
2. Caps and spamming is allowed, but keep it moderated please. (Warn/Kick/Mute/Jail/Ban)
3. Do not advertise any other servers; we really don&#39;t want our population going down. (Warn/Mute/Jail/Ban)

Please note on Rule #2 that the server has a neat little plugin called SpamGuard enabled, so if you don&#39;t keep your spamming moderated, you could receive a temporary ban or a permanent ban.
