    <title>[REQ] Small request, should only take a few mintues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-small-request-should-only-take-a-few-mintues/42962</link>
    <description>Alright, I&#39;m setting up a survey for a school project, and I need 8 pictures total.

So, I need:

[ul]  [*] 1 picture of a women&#39;s face ( Just the face ).
  [*] With this picture, I need you to create a copy, but cut one side off, and mirror the remaining side to replace the cut-out side.

  [*] 1 picture of a man&#39;s face ( Just the face ).
  [*] Again, I need a copy of this picture, but with one side of the face being a mirror image of the other.[/ul]


So, there should be 2 face pictures ( 2 female, 2 male ) and 2 copies of those pictures, which would be mirrored.

I hope this made sense, and I&#39;d really appreciate these soon, like, today. :P

EDIT: I know only need 4 pictures, check above.</description>
