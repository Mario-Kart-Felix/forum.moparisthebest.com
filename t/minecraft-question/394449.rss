    <title>Minecraft question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-question/394449</link>
    <description>My house is up on the highest mountain I could find, and what I basically did was dig down into the mountain a little bit(starting from the top) and set up my house in it. Every time I go to bed on my character I wake up with one of the monsters in my face and they take like half of my life points. Someone suggested that there was some zombie cave near my house and that I needed to go down and destroy it. There is no openings in my house and it is all lit up. Any thoughts?</description>
