    <title>TrisidiaX 317 Crown Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trisidiax-317-crown-help/472568</link>
    <description>I have added in custom rankings and crowns. Player rights 5 = support and there is a custom crown for that rank, aswell as player rights 6 is advisor and there is a custom crown for that. I need help with changing admin crown off of owner (on my server known as Development team). Anyway rights for owner, or development team, are 3 and admins are 2. This screws me up in client.java (client sided) because if I try to add a new modicon it ends up being MODICONS 7 which makes me switch the player rights to 7, which i Dont want. I would like to know if there is any way to do this. I am honestly stumped, any help would be appreciated, let me know if youd like me to post codes id be happy to do so!</description>
