    <description>Okay, so, my Vine Whip is fucked up.
Well just the attacking, everything else is fine.

So when I attack something with it, it does 2 attack anims for every one hit.

The hits are all fine and as they should be, but how can I make it so it&#39;s only one attack animation?</description>
