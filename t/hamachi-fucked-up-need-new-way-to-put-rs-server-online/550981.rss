<p>One thing you should also consider, is that even if you port forward, chances are that you’re required to input your local ip address (10.0.0.20, 192.168.1.175, etc).

There’s two solutions to that (afaik). One, on windows (Unsure about OSX/*Nix) you can go into the network and sharing center and specify a static IP in there, and windows will try to “reserve” that IP. But that isn’t a proper solution, as the computer doesn’t really have a say in the IP address. The most it can do is <span class="bbcode-i">try</span>. The other solution, and the correct way, would be to reserve the IP address in the router settings. Each router handles this a bit differently, so I can’t say how it would go exactly.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah. I’ve only had success with the first option on my Comcast modem+router combo. Setting it on the router level doesn’t work, so i had to go into my adapter settings.</p>

              <p>Rule number 1: NEVER USE HAMACHI</p>
<p>No-IP isn’t hard to configure on your server. Infact No-IP isn’t even required at all to run your server. If you’re worried you may get DoSed or something, NO-IP will not protect you as people can just ping your NO-IP and find your IP.</p>
