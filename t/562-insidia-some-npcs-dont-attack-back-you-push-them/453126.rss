    <title>562 [Insidia] Some NPCs don&#39;t attack back/you push them</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-insidia-some-npcs-dont-attack-back-you-push-them/453126</link>
    <description>So basically I&#39;m using an Insidia source, and most of the dupes/bugs have been patched, but the PvM system was bad to begin with. The problem I&#39;m having is that when you go to kill a monster, it won&#39;t attack back. When you kill it once successfully, it starts attacking back. I want it to automatically attack back on first hit, is there a way to do this? And also, the monsters sometimes move back a brick, and you move up a brick, when you go to attack it, so it essentially &quot;pushes&quot; the monster back and you can&#39;t attack it. Is there a fix for this as well? Thanks a lot guys!</description>
