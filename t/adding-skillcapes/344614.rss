    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-skillcapes/344614</link>
    <description>How do i add the skillcapes? NOT the emotes, but the skillcapes. You might think: wtf? He dnt have skillcapes?. Well, i started from scratch. Now back to the point. I get clue scrolls and baskets when i talk to my skillcapes npc. I added the correct codes.

              <p>usually the skillcape models are packed into the cache, try copying and pasting over a cache from another client that already has them.</p>
<p>that is if you already have the ints.</p>

              <p>So you made your server/client from scratch, no help? I doubt you did that and have no clue how to add skillcapes, lol.</p>
<p>Anyways, you’re suppose to download the models (model section), put them in the models folder, and then login to your server “made by scratch”, and then type in (if correct), “add model ID”, the id of the file, and without the “”.</p>
