        <p>Hello. Since this is my first post I will briefly introduce myself. I used to play Runescaoe some time ago off and on depending if I had access to the internet. The last year I was playing Runescape I got increasingly fustrated with the direction the updates were going. The last straw for me to quit was the squeal of fortune and I am now just wait for Jagex to get sued, fined for violating international gambling laws.</p>
<p>Anywho, I discovered Morparscape recently but am not able to play the game at all. At first I had a white screen on the game with the backround music playing. I reloaded the page and it showed the proper login page, but when a scroll up or down it parts of the log in screen flash white then revert to normal. I am not sure if this is something that should happen but I am just taking note of it in case the info helps.</p>
<p>I noticed that it freezes when I put only 1 character for both a username and password but seems to work when I put more characters in.</p>
<p>When I attempt to log into the game (port 127.0.0.1) I cant get in. I would copy down the exact message but I tried to log in while typing this and now I have a message of “Sorry, an error has accrued whilst loading Runescape”. When I go over to the tab where it is (I am using Firefox by the way) it turns grey for about a second before displaying the error.</p>
<p>Also I am using Windows 7 64 pro 64bit</p>
<p>I am happy to supply any information to help resolve this problem with in reason. Please also keep in mind that I am not an expert with computers or OS so if the problem solving you suggest may be a little advanced, then please provide step by step.</p>
<h2>I noticed that is seems to freeze when I put only 1 letter for both the password and username.</h2>
<h2>I just had the ladder error message displayed once again but this time the back round is light gray as opposed to black.</h2>
<h2>Reloading the site is constantly results in the ladder error. This happened after I cleared my browsing history, cookies, ect</h2>
<h2>Forgot to mention that I also updated my java because my first error was something to do with my java plugin. Have not had that error sense however.</h2>
<h2>I went to the  MoparScape 4.0 link and it got me further. I used the default port and was able to reach the login screen after it downloaded cache. When I try to log in it gives me an error message “error connecting to server”</h2>
<p>I was able to finally log into the 4.0 Moparscape. Now I am just curious as to how to munipulate my skill levels, looks ect, or find a server that starts you out at just level 1 for all skills (except health) But I do believe that is for anther topic and I am sure a tutorial exists on this forum for what I am looking for.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly (and if I dont please do correct me) 127.0.0.1 is connecting to my own computer. It is also the only server I have attempted to connect to. I am not sure how to make sure it is successfully compiled or if all ips are set to 127.0.0.1</p>
