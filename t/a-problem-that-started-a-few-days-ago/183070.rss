    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-problem-that-started-a-few-days-ago/183070</link>
    <description>Before I start, I would like to let you know that I am not a newb trying to run a server for the first time, I have been running my server for well over a year.
I&#39;ve been through many troubles along the way. but this one wont give up.

Well a few days ago my server just stopped...everyone was disconnected and no one could log in through the 4 no-ip i have on this computer. I&#39;ve tried almost everything, I re-port forwarded, restarted my modem and my router several times, I&#39;ve restored my router to default and port forward I took my firewall COMPLEATLY off, I system restored....still nothing at all.

I very much enjoy running a server, and I wanna keep running my server. I&#39;m not asking for a host nor anything to do with that. I&#39;m just asking for a solution to my problem. I really hope someone can help me. :/ I really hope this isn&#39;t the end to my private server career.</description>

              <p>yes</p>
<p>when you shut down your router</p>
<p>you’re ip might be switched around with the other connections on that router</p>
<p>it happens frequently when im on road trips and such</p>
<p>try the linksys page again</p>
<p>and match your ip with it</p>
<p>run &gt; cmd &gt; ipconfig</p>

              <p>hmm, would that be caused by restarting your router?</p>
<p>And I’m sure it’s not a bad code, I check the cmd throughoutly.</p>
