Impossible, because you would have to have every cache and every model packed in one client, and the programing process would strife; therefore this would be imposable to nearly imposable.[/quote]</p>
<p>this is not impossible i have used a client that worked that well before for about 90% of servers, just didnt do well on allstar type, but i asked for this client because i am making a server and dont have time to make a client im only on comp 1-2 times a week.<br>
[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 27, 2009, 04:15:45 pm[/size][hr]skittle thanks i tried your client but it doesnt work for this source i might use another though so thanks still.</p>

A guide is meant to teach you something new. You do not learn when you rely on another’s work. Unless you are willing to learn, please get off of these forums.</p>

<p>BTW how would i learn that? oh yea i would look up a guide.</p>
<p>A GUIDE IS SOME1 ELSES WORK</p>
<p>unless i was the inventor of all this stuff i will have to rely on some1 elses work.</p>
