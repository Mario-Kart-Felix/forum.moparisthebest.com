    <title>Logging in with Hyperion + 474 Client Help (Picture)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/logging-in-with-hyperion-474-client-help-picture/403373</link>
    <description>   I can&#39;t seem to find what the problem is with me logging in. Obviously I&#39;ve imported Hyperion into eclipse and having it running (Obviously to the point where it says READY). So now I need a client, correct? So I found [b]z474&#39;s Client[/b], Although, when I try to run it. This is the issue I get:

 Obviously the server is running. Most clients that you download are automatically set to either 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1? If I search the client folder for some serverip or something along those lines I don&#39;t find anything.

  PS: When I tried running Hyperion on the Moparscape webclient, it worked fine.</description>

I don’t know the exact problem, although if you are changing clients, it could be a computer problem and or a server problem? Try restarting your computer or getting a new source. Other then that, I don’t know it.<br>

<p>Thanks for the help, but neither worked. Well, at least not restarting the computer worked. I’m not going to change sources (until I’ve exhausted all possibilities with trying to find a client for Hyperion), because as most of us know. Hyperion is the most stable base out there.[/quote]</p>
