    <title>Question About Cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-cache/527054</link>
    <description>Okay so i am not that good with coding servers or anything but like a year ago I used to mess around leech off of servers and code a little but all i would do is download the source and client and change it to my ip. Anywaysss my question is why all of a sudden do I have to download the cache separately? Why doesn&#39;t it automatically just go into my C:\ anymore? If I want somebody else to play my server will they have to download both the client and the cache and manually put it in their C:\? idk haha i might sound kinda dumb lol but please help. Thanks  :)</description>
