    * Make an iron rock give you every ore at random + money.
    * A fun pking ring somewhere in lumbridge that you can mess about in.

    * Make p-king inside an actual dungeon, instead of the wilderness.
    * Make hammers and bowstrings break occassionally.
    * Cows in the sheep field
    * Upgrade fires just like real rs and let you cook off them?
    * Added more food cookable, e.g raw beef &amp; raw chicken.
    * Furnace is in the house near Bob&#39;s axe shop in lumbridge, banks there also
    * Fishing spots are around the lumbridge bridge.
    * Fish sharks from the spot near the goblin house.
    * Tonnes of NPCs to train on, most with drops (will update)
    * Add god wars in the future.
    * Slayer will be in the lumbridge swamp in the future.
    * Flax can be picked across the river lum, and can be spun inside lumb castle.
    * Bones to give proper xp, and anvils will give less smithing xp also.
    * Many dungeons and quests filled with monsters.
    * Fires visible to other players
    * Lumbridge guide to give basic items &amp; help?
    * Farming can be done by using a seed with a seed dibber anywhere to grow plants!
    * Removed maze minigame, adding demon minigame, the demons drop keys, which you get
      rewards for.
    * Proper runecrafting in the future
    * Proper price list coming soon
    * Removed teleporting crystals, added books.
    * Making good armour harder to get, e.g not in shops.

    * Making fishing, smithing (dungeon), woodcutting + slayer (dungeon) spots in draynor.
    * Adding guards in and around draynor jail that auto attack you as you pass by
    * Adding full fletching in the future, no more shops, kill chickens chop trees etc.
    * Added two banks, which have different purposes, yet to be discovered :S
    * Adding new minigames such as goblin strike.
    * (Mabye) adding swimming... :s good luck!
    * Making most NPCs have dialogue.
    * Improved lagg condition and removed un-nessecary classes and handlers.
    * Now capable of holding over 300 players at a time.
    * Adding extra curtains to the north and south banks.
    * Will add arrow projectiles in future
