    <title>Need help with auto cache - trisidia x based client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-auto-cache-trisidia-x-based-client/546794</link>
    <description>Hey there, i trying to make an rsps for a school assignment, and have seem to have luck thus far, but am having difficulty setting up my auto cache. I have zipped my cache into a zip file, and uploaded to dropbox. I then put that link in what i believe to be the appropriate spots in my cachedownloader, client, and gui.java. I as well changed my signlink to the right location. I have uploaded my client folder, as well as my cache zip file to dropbox. If anyone could help me i would appreciate it. Please ignore the nooby server name lol

              <p>You have the Link posted like this: cache - <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/di29bnmkzxgc6tu/BrandonScape.zip?dl=0" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.dropbox.com/s/di29bnmkzxgc6tu/BrandonScape.zip?dl=0</a></p>
<p>Change it to like this: cache - <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/di29bnmkzxgc6tu/BrandonScape.zip" rel="nofollow noopener">https://dl.dropbox.com/s/di29bnmkzxgc6tu/BrandonScape.zip</a></p>
<p>dl instead of www and at the end cut off the: ?dl=0</p>
<p>Should work. I hope so.</p>
