    <description>Hello everyone my name is Lee I am here from Rune-Server I&#39;ve been working on a source for awhile that is Project Insanity simply this server does look like shit, but I took it to the next level, and have added many things so far, I really want to take this server to the highest potential I can, throughout that journey I am willing to make new close friends, that would like to develop and run the server with me, below you will find what skills I am interested in, thanks for your time. 

[i]What Am I Looking For?[/i] -

Website Developer
Co-Owner

[i]Skills Required[/i] -

Know how to keep a server clean, I can do all the coding but the question is can you keep it right? Can you keep the server straight the community happy, the forums well active and built? 


When I plan on releasing this server online to the public, I can see many people just getting so addicted to the server they&#39;re going to stay, and that&#39;s what I love users staying at an community makes me feel so welcome :)

Skills: I can code Java (I can’t really give myself a grade for it, sorry), I know how to handle people in different situations (Angry, sad, mad, whatever)<br>
Do you Code at all?: I do, I have coded quite a few 317s too but I could never get it rolling due to the lack of money for a VPS <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
Are you willing to go far with this Project?: I do. I will do whatever it takes to contribute to this project. I can also provide a few things already but we can discuss that on skype ^^<br>
