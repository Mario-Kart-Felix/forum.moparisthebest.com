<p>This goes back to your previous comment. If someone can’t take shit on the internet, they shouldn’t use it. Well, lets face it, the internet plays a big roll in day-to-day life, one can not just simply quite ‘using’ the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>one does not simply ‘quite’ the internet; hm yes quite indeed</p>
<p>on a serious fucking note this argument is horseshit and you should feel like horseshit, the difference between “being bullied on the internet” and being bullied in real life is that in real life you have no choice in being confronted by it, if you are being bullied at school you are likely being bullied by people who live close to you and will see you for the next several years of your life day in day out, you can either fight or flight and not much else, when being bullied in real life there’s very little you can do about it</p>
<p>however, if you’re being “bullied on the internet” (the term being in quotes because I find the term to be an oxymoron) there are several steps you can take to prevent it, and your choice of “quit the internet or face online bullying” is a false dichotomy because you choose to ignore, or are ignorant of those options</p>
<p>allow me to explain, on this website, moparscape, you are using what is known as a forum and most forum software comes with the ability to ignore all posts by a user, for example, go to “profile &gt; modify profile &gt; edit buddy/ignore list” and you can add people to ignore posts from, tada, you can now use this website without pesky bullies bullying you, ignoring that you can ignore problematic sections of the website or the website all together, ignoring that you can ignore the whole social side of the scene and you’ll never have any one bully you here ever again!</p>
<p>this is of course ignoring the one exception that people you know in real life who bully you both in real life and on the internet, this is exempt from the discussion because it falls into the realm of bullying in real life which as I stated is a serious problem unlike the trivial issue of anonymous people being mean to you online, boohoo</p>

<p>Words hurt, words kill, whether you want to believe it or not. Some people can’t take the emotional torture, that’s my whole point. I have seen comments such as “you should rage quit life right now” I mean, who the fuck says that to someone? Internet or not. It shouldn’t be tolerated whatsoever. You have no clue what people go through, regarding real life issues.</p>

</aside>
<p>and just because I can, go kill yourself you piece of worthless shit</p>
<p>I say this because it’s offensive and I’m an asshole, if you have suicidal thoughts or tendencies because of what I said, then you have deep seeded, serious mental issues that are likely not caused by little old me, and I say this not as an insult but to urge you to seek professional medical help IMMEDIATELY, if you do not then good for you, you cunt</p>

</aside>
<p>real physical or emotional bullying taken place in the real world (with it extending on to the internet, not inclusive of “internet bullying”) IS punishable by law assuming you don’t live in a 3rd world country, the issue is you are confusing people being assholes with “bullying on the internet” which is a serious fucking problem</p>

<p>aha only confirming my suspicions that you live in a 3rd world country, you see, since fresh clean water is a human right, in my country at least and for most of europe water providers cannot cut your water off because you don’t pay your water bill, but that’s america for you, don’t trample on my rights even if I’m a water company and am cutting off water to people because they can’t pay their bill!</p>

</aside>
<p>as much as I hate victim blaming, it’s your own god damn fault for being so emotionally disturbed that an online anonymous relationship can make or break your emotional state, furthermore it’s your own god damn fault for not seeking out professional medical care for what in this hypothetical situation would be some serious mental issues, feeling suicidal and depressed is not god damned normal or healthy, stop treating it like it is</p>

<p>I know this is somewhat unrelated to the subject at hand, but take child pornography as an example. You sent your ‘girlfriend’ some nude pics, and she posts them all over facebook, and whatever other sites she visits. Think about all the people online that will consistently harass you. Sure, no one should ever do this, but it happens every day, and lives are lost because of this stupidity. This plays in both real life and cyber bullying.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>please refer to my previous statement of “it’s your own god damned fault”, sending unwarranted sexual images to someone can be considered sexual harassment, so in that hypothetical situation you would NOT be blameless in the situation, and it’s certainly a situation you bought on yourself</p>

</aside>
<p>well you see if I lost my loved one to bullying, oh wait, I wouldn’t because I would get them professional medical care if I felt the need to long before they caused any self harm</p>
<p>you know I was reading something quite eerie the other day, people who are in a fractured emotional state who consider suicide often appear happier the days before committing suicide, because they “finally found a way to end the sadness”, I find this eerie not because it’s about people killing themselves but because their friends and families could let them get in such an emotional state, and furthermore that they could let them god damn selves get in such a god damn emotional state</p>
<p>and since it needs to be said in every thread about bullying: bullying isn’t the god damn cause of anything, deep seeded mental health issues are the cause and bullying, among other things, are the catalyst</p>
<p>and just to make it explicitly clear, this post is about “bullying on the internet” exclusive from real life bullying which carries over to facebook and the like, this post is NOT about bullying that occurs independent of the internet</p>

        <p><span class="mention">@silab</span> I’m not a victim of internet bullying, I just sympathize for people that are. I don’t understand why they let internet bullying get to them, but they do. I guess they are just really bad at conflict and resolution skills. I also don’t understand depression. If you are sad, then just do something that makes you happy. However, I understand people do suffer from depression and sometimes it can be a chemical imbalance in the brain, and therefore I sympathize for them. I just feel if they had a hobby/something to give their life purpose they wouldn’t be as depressed/not depressed at all. Are all of these teenagers that are saying they are depressed really depressed? Who knows, but why not act like they are and be safe rather than ignore their plights and end up with a suicide. Same goes with internet bullying. Should they let it get to them? No, but since they are, why not try and comfort them and try and teach them how to resolve issues that are being brought up online.</p>

Bullying in real life is a problem and I know I’ve had to deal with it over the years. But bullying online? That’s just total bullshit.

<p>This all comes down to insecurities and your ability to cope with feedback, whether positive, negative, useful, or not.

<p>Take a look, first of all. It was her fault aswell, she actually posted her nudes at 15, she was lying when she made that video.<br>
She didnt even post boobs, she posted more than that. Yes, she did make a mistake and it was cruel for those people to follow her. But she also slept around with a guy who has a girlfriend, another flaw.</p>

        <p>Anyone supporting Amanda Todd is truly ignorant. Girl is/“acts like” a complete slut and expected to be treated like a decent person? she was given multiple chances to start a new life every time she found ways to bring up the past. Obviously she enjoyed it.</p>
<p>I have no respect for this bitch because the entire coverage of the story furthers the stereotype that if you kill yourself all the wrongdoings you have done magically disappear.</p>

        <p>Trolling and bullying are completely different thinks, cyber bullying is only called that when it is by somebody you know. Trolling is when somebody who you never met will just annoy somebody to get a reaction. The only way to stop trolling is to turn off your computer, then they cannot get to you.</p>

        <p>The people that truly do get their shit smacked are the ones who usually are begging for it.</p>
<p>Calling someone mean words isn’t worth posting a thread about. Making someones life a living Hell, where they’re reminded of what they did and what the consequences are, MIGHT be worth posting a thread about if It’s bad enough. Even if you do that, you’re just throwing fuel on the fire. If you’re being bullied, go to your local P.D. and file something. Go ahead and grab a piece of candy from that cute little basket on your way out; they’re already laughing at you anyway. When single mothers are being stalked and harassed via the net everyday, your problems aren’t very top-of-the-list.</p>
<p>Tl;DR</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Internet is the Devil’s playground<br>
Play in it without caution or remorse and get burnt<br>
Thousands of crimes take place on the other side every single day<br>
Nobody gives a shit about a bully victim who didn’t even get it bad</p>
