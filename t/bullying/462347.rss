    <title>Bullying</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bullying/462347</link>
    <description>Bullying is bullying, plain and simple. If someone causes another to harm/take their own life, it becomes a legal issue. Again, i&#39;m not saying someone will take their own life because of trolls on Mopar, but it [b]is[/b] possible. This goes back to your previous comment. If someone can&#39;t take shit on the internet, they shouldn&#39;t use it. Well, lets face it, the internet plays a big roll in day-to-day life, one can not just simply quite &#39;using&#39; the internet.


&lt;blockquote&gt;What i meant was they are far away&lt;/blockquote&gt;
You never know, I have met 3 other people who live within 30 minutes of me, here.

 &lt;blockquote&gt;how could you let them hurt you&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Words hurt, words kill, whether you want to believe it or not. Some people can&#39;t take the emotional torture, that&#39;s my whole point. I have seen comments such as &quot;you should rage quit life right now&quot; I mean, who the fuck says that to someone? Internet or not. It shouldn&#39;t be tolerated whatsoever. You have no clue what people go through, regarding real life issues.

^

A conversation KroniKz_ and I had [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,564762.msg4113561.html]here[/url]
You may want to read the comments before they are deleted, i&#39;m assuming they will be in the next few hours.

I just want everyone&#39;s opinion on bullying. Should it be punishable by law? What should be done? What would you do?

              <p>the “bullier” is looking for one thing only, a response. Hence you literally ignore them. Which is so easy to do on the web.</p>
<p>In the case where you do something stupid and it goes viral and the whole internets are after you, there’s not much you can do. But still the best action is no action, don’t respond and it will fade out soon.</p>
<p>There may be a mental aspect to online bullying, but I have a hard time being sympathetic, when the bullied can so easily ignore the bully with no repercussions.</p>

<p>Calling someone mean words isn’t worth posting a thread about. Making someones life a living Hell, where they’re reminded of what they did and what the consequences are, MIGHT be worth posting a thread about if It’s bad enough. Even if you do that, you’re just throwing fuel on the fire. If you’re being bullied, go to your local P.D. and file something. Go ahead and grab a piece of candy from that cute little basket on your way out; they’re already laughing at you anyway. When single mothers are being stalked and harassed via the net everyday, your problems aren’t very top-of-the-list.</p>

<p>The Internet is the Devil’s playground<br>
Play in it without caution or remorse and get burnt<br>
Thousands of crimes take place on the other side every single day<br>
Nobody gives a shit about a bully victim who didn’t even get it bad</p>

I don’t want to be insensitive, but I have never, nor will I ever, punish for e-bullying. Bullying in real life is a problem and I know I’ve had to deal with it over the years. But bullying online? That’s just total bullshit. If someone’s bothering you online, either dish it back, let them at it so they make a fool of themselves, or just ignore them. They can’t do shit to you over the internet. What if they slander your name? Who cares? No one else is going to give two shits if someone’s running around on the internet calling you are moron.</p>
<p>This all comes down to insecurities and your ability to cope with feedback, whether positive, negative, useful, or not. If you are bulliable on the internet, you need to seriously analyze your insecurities and think about what’s actually happening. People can do nothing to you over the internet to actually harm you. What problem is there? The psychological aspects are 1000x times worse in person, so that’s the type of bullying I will be against, not this cyberspace bullshit.</p>
<p>And yes, this topic is about karma removal, not about ebullying principles. If you can’t handle <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, don’t go there.<br>

<p>Take a look, first of all. It was her fault aswell, she actually posted her nudes at 15, she was lying when she made that video.<br>
She didnt even post boobs, she posted more than that. Yes, she did make a mistake and it was cruel for those people to follow her. But she also slept around with a guy who has a girlfriend, another flaw.</p>
<p>Don’t believe what the media tells you.</p>

I don’t understand why they let internet bullying get to them, but they do. I guess they are just really bad at conflict and resolution skills. I also don’t understand depression. If you are sad, then just do something that makes you happy. However, I understand people do suffer from depression and sometimes it can be a chemical imbalance in the brain, and therefore I sympathize for them. I just feel if they had a hobby/something to give their life purpose they wouldn’t be as depressed/not depressed at all. Are all of these teenagers that are saying they are depressed really depressed? Who knows, but why not act like they are and be safe rather than ignore their plights and end up with a suicide. Same goes with internet bullying. Should they let it get to them? No, but since they are, why not try and comfort them and try and teach them how to resolve issues that are being brought up online.</p>

<p>This goes back to your previous comment. If someone can’t take shit on the internet, they shouldn’t use it. Well, lets face it, the internet plays a big roll in day-to-day life, one can not just simply quite ‘using’ the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>one does not simply ‘quite’ the internet; hm yes quite indeed</p>
<p>on a serious fucking note this argument is horseshit and you should feel like horseshit, the difference between “being bullied on the internet” and being bullied in real life is that in real life you have no choice in being confronted by it, if you are being bullied at school you are likely being bullied by people who live close to you and will see you for the next several years of your life day in day out, you can either fight or flight and not much else, when being bullied in real life there’s very little you can do about it</p>
<p>however, if you’re being “bullied on the internet” (the term being in quotes because I find the term to be an oxymoron) there are several steps you can take to prevent it, and your choice of “quit the internet or face online bullying” is a false dichotomy because you choose to ignore, or are ignorant of those options</p>
<p>allow me to explain, on this website, moparscape, you are using what is known as a forum and most forum software comes with the ability to ignore all posts by a user, for example, go to “profile &gt; modify profile &gt; edit buddy/ignore list” and you can add people to ignore posts from, tada, you can now use this website without pesky bullies bullying you, ignoring that you can ignore problematic sections of the website or the website all together, ignoring that you can ignore the whole social side of the scene and you’ll never have any one bully you here ever again!</p>
<p>this is of course ignoring the one exception that people you know in real life who bully you both in real life and on the internet, this is exempt from the discussion because it falls into the realm of bullying in real life which as I stated is a serious problem unlike the trivial issue of anonymous people being mean to you online, boohoo</p>

<p>I know this is somewhat unrelated to the subject at hand, but take child pornography as an example.

Sure, no one should ever do this, but it happens every day, and lives are lost because of this stupidity. This plays in both real life and cyber bullying.</p>

<p>well you see if I lost my loved one to bullying, oh wait, I wouldn’t because I would get them professional medical care if I felt the need to long before they caused any self harm</p>
<p>you know I was reading something quite eerie the other day, people who are in a fractured emotional state who consider suicide often appear happier the days before committing suicide, because they “finally found a way to end the sadness”, I find this eerie not because it’s about people killing themselves but because their friends and families could let them get in such an emotional state, and furthermore that they could let them god damn selves get in such a god damn emotional state</p>
<p>and since it needs to be said in every thread about bullying: bullying isn’t the god damn cause of anything, deep seeded mental health issues are the cause and bullying, among other things, are the catalyst</p>
<p>and just to make it explicitly clear, this post is about “bullying on the internet” exclusive from real life bullying which carries over to facebook and the like, this post is NOT about bullying that occurs independent of the internet</p>

<p>Words hurt, words kill, whether you want to believe it or not. Some people can’t take the emotional torture, that’s my whole point. I have seen comments such as “you should rage quit life right now” I mean, who the fuck says that to someone? Internet or not. It shouldn’t be tolerated whatsoever. You have no clue what people go through, regarding real life issues.</p>

<p>Words only hurt if you let them hurt, and I learned to drown out any abuse that was thrown at me over time.  In my own opinion, public schools should teach their students that words don’t hurt you unless you let them.</p>
<p>This doesn’t justify bullying, clearly, it’s a terrible thing.  I was bullied pretty much until freshman year of high school and then I finally came to my standpoint that you can say whatever the hell you want about me, I’m more than likely going to end off better than you if you get your kicks of torture.</p>

<p>Also, one can not simply quit using the internet, so telling people who can’t ‘handle’ it to stay off isn’t even ‘fair’, to say the least. It isn’t them who needs to stay off, it’s the immature bullies. If they aren’t mature enough to respect everyone, they’re not mature enough to use such a tool (in this case, the internet). Half the e-bullies are probably insecure about themselves so they must take it out on someone (internet or real life) that is weaker than them, physically and emotionally.</p>

<p>Despite this fact, no one can take away their ability to use their own personal computer or the internet as there’s no set rule on what each person considers bullying and what each person can take.  It would also end up with people doing the ‘finger pointing’ game and saying “x told me to fuck off, ban him” even though the reporter attacked him first.</p>
<p>My point is that it’s not something that’s stoppable, it will always exist because not all people can co-exist peacefully.  No matter how terrible it is or may become, there’s no way to really enforce any set laws on bullying properly, especially over the internet where people are from multiple countries.</p>

              <p>Well, it could be considered e-bullying if the bullies took it to the social networking websites, (e.g Facebook, Twitter, etc). Moving on, this thread wasn’t even create to be based solely on only e-bullying, but bullying in general. Anyway, It is both wrong and twisted to harass someone on the internet, knowing they can’t physically retaliate. If everyone was mature, problems such as this would cease to exist, but lets get real, that will never happen seeing as this is reality. I’m just tired of seeing people say they don’t care, but if it was their loved one that was lost, it’d be a totally different story.</p>

              <p>Bullying works the same way real life and on the internet. They usually target the individual’s insecurities. The difference between bullying on the internet and in the real world is that they cannot harm you physically online. People have different insecurities and different tolerances to what they can take. I personally wish that nobody would bully online or in the real world, as neither is healthy or morally correct. However, I understand Taharok’s stand on this topic. This isn’t a daycare, and he simply cannot punish people for bullying. Albeit, it would surely be nice (as David said) if he (or anyone else for that matter) saw someone being bullied on <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> or whatever and sent them a private message and said something like, “Hey don’t take it personal. They are just messing with you. Just ignore them and act yourself. Don’t brag or lie about awesome you are, just have a normal conversation. If you still don’t fit in, then perhaps you should just stay away from <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, as not everyone meshes with everybody”.</p>
<p>Also as David said, those guys may just be messing around and the other individual takes it personally and as bullying because of low self esteem and insecurities.</p>
