    <title>Bullying</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bullying/447779</link>
    <description>One of the most dramatic issues in the world right now is bullying. People all around the world are trying to take actions to tackle it, but in fact it is not enough. Adults cannot always protect children or even other adults from being bullied 24/7. For some people, it is human nature to point out flaws in others and even manipulate those flaws which evens down to bullying. About 4,400 people every year commit suicide due to bully related events, and this is just pathetic. I really don&#39;t understand why people bully, because in fact they are the true cowards. Bullying is something that will always exist and it cannot be prevented 100%, however, people could take a bigger step and start taking bigger actions in bullying, no matter the severity of the case.

I just thought I would post my thoughts on bullying, but I really want to hear others&#39; thoughts on this subject, so please, take a minute of your time and state your opinion.</description>

              <p>I think people are insecure if they let it affect them. Most of bullying are just observations, like saying “you’re fat” or whatever. Let’s face it though overweight people probably think to themselves they are overweight, so why does it affect you when someone else says it? If you accept who you are it won’t bother you imo.</p>

              <p>What exactly do you propose we do?  I’ve seen people say that we need to take bigger action to PREVENT it, but I say we need more help supporting those who are bullied.  It’s not like you can change someone’s parenting or values, nor can you change the way the bully behaves half the time.  I’d more or less rather give some support to those who are being bullied, seems easier than trying to change someone’s mindset.  Then again, I have no clue what most anti-bully foundations do, so I guess it’s not my place to speak.</p>
<p>[quote=“Scape-JAVA, post:2, topic:447779”]Because, most bullies have problems at home/are insecure about something in their life so they pick a target and try to point out flaws that usually don’t exist, and if they do they’re very minor flaws. That’s how they make somebody feel so insecure about themselves.</p>
<p>I use to bully people physically because I was bullied emotional when I was around 10/11, and it was just because I was overweight. There was not a thing wrong with me then, all I had was extra weight, and people still decided to judge me. Infact, the person that was picking on me was 3 years older and had a very severe case of acne and was bullied for that, so.[/quote]<br>
I get judged by my weight and looks by my generation all the time.  It doesn’t bother me anymore really, I find it funny how they can’t seem to accept that not everyone is super attractive.</p>
