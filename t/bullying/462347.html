<blockquote>What i meant was they are far away</blockquote>
You never know, I have met 3 other people who live within 30 minutes of me, here.
 <blockquote>how could you let them hurt you</blockquote>
Words hurt, words kill, whether you want to believe it or not. Some people can't take the emotional torture, that's my whole point. I have seen comments such as "you should rage quit life right now" I mean, who the fuck says that to someone? Internet or not. It shouldn't be tolerated whatsoever. You have no clue what people go through, regarding real life issues.
<p>^</p>
<p>A conversation KroniKz_ and I had <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,564762.msg4113561.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a><br>
You may want to read the comments before they are deleted, i’m assuming they will be in the next few hours.</p>
<p>I just want everyone’s opinion on bullying. Should it be punishable by law? What should be done? What would you do?</p>
<p>Discuss.</p>

        <p>How I feel about real life bullying:<br>
Depends how they are bullying you, if your an outcast and they know secrets that really hurt you. I hate that, those words get to me, I have a friend that gets picked on for his mom dying. Occasionally on the internet for the people that don’t know him they say jokes about “your mom” and they think he’s lying so thats another think I’m against. There isn’t much of discussion though, bullying is illegal and wrong.</p>
<p>On the internet though, there’s not much a problem unless your really sensitive… You should not let things get to you like that. I mean, if they spend all there time trying to bully you over the internet then at the end of the day they are just some fat ass wasting his time on the computer all day, you should be the one laughing at those people! You shouldn’t even retaliate, just laugh at them and say waste your time on the computer fighting with people. It’s not really a problem if your smart enough to understand it’s ridiculous  :o</p>

<p>It was comments like this ^ that I didn’t want. If you would’ve read the thread, you would’ve came across this:</p>
<blockquote>Words hurt, words kill, whether you want to believe it or not. Some people can't take the emotional torture, that's my whole point</blockquote>
If you're going to comment on such a thread that causes people to take their lives every single day, the least you could do is put some thought into it. Is that so much to ask?
<p>KroniKz_, I agree with you. They should be laughing at the people bullying them, I do. But then again, everyone is different. I have friends that get bullied everyday and they retaliate, physically. Fighting will only cause more problems, IMO. Use this as a scenario:</p>
<p>Your mom has a physical disability and can’t afford to work. You have no money, no nice clothes, no clue where your next meal is coming from and you live in a trailer. You told all of this to a friend you’ve known on the internet for over 5+ years and he decides to make fun of you, along with the real life bullying taking place as well. He would then continue to emotionally harass you about your mom and such. How would you react? Back to the real-life situation. The kids at school would tell you to take a shower, even though your mom didn’t have the funds to pay the water bill, they would then continue to tell you how bad you smell, how you shouldn’t be on this earth. How would this make you feel? What would <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> do?</p>
<p>Again, some people are emotionally stronger than others. I wish everyone could be like this, but we’re in reality, and it will never happen.</p>

        <p>People online you don’t know shouldn’t be able to hurt your feelings. However, there are people that are very insecure about who they are and it hurts them to hear bad things about them. I think if you see someone like this, you should try to help them and try to get others to not be as mean either. Hopefully help them get through their insecurities. I used to take everything people said about me online very seriously, now I don’t really give a fuck unless it’s people I consider friends online (unless of course it’s playful, like a lot of guys do; and being able to tell the difference is a key skill online :P)</p>
<p>I should point out the majority of online bullying that really hurts people is a hybrid of sorts. Like people they know in real life making fun of them online through social media or whatever. This is never acceptable.</p>

that would honestly get to me because I would be like “yo, I trusted you all these years as a good friend of mine and I never did anything to you! So you decide to harass me and let me secrets out man?” I would honestly be upset for a while, depends what he did with the information.</p>
<p>In all honestly though, I never tell anyone on the internet anything important, even if I know them in real life. Never trust anyone, you don’t know who that person is going to be in the future.</p>

        <p>I know this is somewhat unrelated to the subject at hand, but take child pornography as an example. You sent your ‘girlfriend’ some nude pics, and she posts them all over facebook, and whatever other sites she visits. Think about all the people online that will consistently harass you. Sure, no one should ever do this, but it happens every day, and lives are lost because of this stupidity. This plays in both real life and cyber bullying.</p>

        <p>Bullying is a way of showing someone that you’re bigger then them, it has been happening since two living organisms met on ones territory. The human race is very emotional, being bullied no longer means what it used to mean. Instead of just leaving, the bullied cries about it and thinks their life is horrible. Everyone at some point has been bullied, if it was by their parents or peers, it has happened. People just have to learn to live with it and either fight back or move away instead of taking the easy road and committing suicide. If every other species has to live with it, why can’t we?</p>

        <p>As most of the members here know, I was victim to e-bullying. Of course being the horrible person I am, I retaliated and e-bullied back. Even if its on the internet, you’re degrading someone and that can physically hurt them. I then heard the bully committed suicide. I felt sorry and partly to blame. I had sympathy for the guy. Later I found out it was all a lie and he bullied people even more by lieing to the few friends he had.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is those who e-bully usually are the ones who get bullied in real life. They take out their anger on easy targets over the internet because nothing can physically happen to them. Please don’t tell me “Oh, its the internet. Who gives two shits.”</p>

<p>Yeah, Stuart, I know. But I don’t care; if text over the internet would cause you to retaliate harm on yourself… well, somethings wrong.</p>

<p>[quote=“Taharok”]I don’t want to be insensitive, but I have never, nor will I ever, punish for e-bullying. Bullying in real life is a problem and I know I’ve had to deal with it over the years. But bullying online? That’s just total bullshit. If someone’s bothering you online, either dish it back, let them at it so they make a fool of themselves, or just ignore them. They can’t do shit to you over the internet. What if they slander your name? Who cares? No one else is going to give two shits if someone’s running around on the internet calling you are moron.</p>
<p>This all comes down to insecurities and your ability to cope with feedback, whether positive, negative, useful, or not. If you are bulliable on the internet, you need to seriously analyze your insecurities and think about what’s actually happening. People can do nothing to you over the internet to actually harm you. What problem is there? The psychological aspects are 1000x times worse in person, so that’s the type of bullying I will be against, not this cyberspace bullshit.[/quote]</p>
<p>suport++;</p>
<p>Yeah if they take their life or cause harm to themselves, it’s a disappointment that they potentially gave up; but still it’s the fucking internet if you can’t handle it, get off.</p>
<p>before you bastards fucking assume that I support any kind of bullying, I don’t it’s wrong on many levels, but refer to my main point, IT’S THE INTERNET.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Fails</span>, I never said in real life did I? I said on the internet, if it’s happening in real life you need to talk to someone persay a counselor, family, the law? Someone with authority that can do something about it.</p>

        <p>Bullying works the same way real life and on the internet. They usually target the individual’s insecurities. The difference between bullying on the internet and in the real world is that they cannot harm you physically online. People have different insecurities and different tolerances to what they can take. I personally wish that nobody would bully online or in the real world, as neither is healthy or morally correct. However, I understand Taharok’s stand on this topic. This isn’t a daycare, and he simply cannot punish people for bullying. Albeit, it would surely be nice (as David said) if he (or anyone else for that matter) saw someone being bullied on <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span> or whatever and sent them a private message and said something like, “Hey don’t take it personal. They are just messing with you. Just ignore them and act yourself. Don’t brag or lie about awesome you are, just have a normal conversation. If you still don’t fit in, then perhaps you should just stay away from <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, as not everyone meshes with everybody”.</p>
<p>Also as David said, those guys may just be messing around and the other individual takes it personally and as bullying because of low self esteem and insecurities.</p>

        <p>Well, it could be considered e-bullying if the bullies took it to the social networking websites, (e.g Facebook, Twitter, etc). Moving on, this thread wasn’t even create to be based solely on only e-bullying, but bullying in general. Anyway, It is both wrong and twisted to harass someone on the internet, knowing they can’t physically retaliate. If everyone was mature, problems such as this would cease to exist, but lets get real, that will never happen seeing as this is reality. I’m just tired of seeing people say they don’t care, but if it was their loved one that was lost, it’d be a totally different story.</p>
<p>Also, one can not simply quit using the internet, so telling people who can’t ‘handle’ it to stay off isn’t even ‘fair’, to say the least. It isn’t them who needs to stay off, it’s the immature bullies. If they aren’t mature enough to respect everyone, they’re not mature enough to use such a tool (in this case, the internet). Half the e-bullies are probably insecure about themselves so they must take it out on someone (internet or real life) that is weaker than them, physically and emotionally.</p>

<p>Words hurt, words kill, whether you want to believe it or not. Some people can’t take the emotional torture, that’s my whole point. I have seen comments such as “you should rage quit life right now” I mean, who the fuck says that to someone? Internet or not. It shouldn’t be tolerated whatsoever. You have no clue what people go through, regarding real life issues.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Words only hurt if you let them hurt, and I learned to drown out any abuse that was thrown at me over time.  In my own opinion, public schools should teach their students that words don’t hurt you unless you let them.</p>
<p>This doesn’t justify bullying, clearly, it’s a terrible thing.  I was bullied pretty much until freshman year of high school and then I finally came to my standpoint that you can say whatever the hell you want about me, I’m more than likely going to end off better than you if you get your kicks of torture.</p>

<p>Despite this fact, no one can take away their ability to use their own personal computer or the internet as there’s no set rule on what each person considers bullying and what each person can take.  It would also end up with people doing the ‘finger pointing’ game and saying “x told me to fuck off, ban him” even though the reporter attacked him first.</p>
<p>My point is that it’s not something that’s stoppable, it will always exist because not all people can co-exist peacefully.  No matter how terrible it is or may become, there’s no way to really enforce any set laws on bullying properly, especially over the internet where people are from multiple countries.</p>
