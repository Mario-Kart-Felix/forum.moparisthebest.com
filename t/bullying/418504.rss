    <title>Bullying</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bullying/418504</link>
    <description>Has anyone here on Moparscape ever been bullied? I for a fact have, when I was in grade school, I was a little fat, and people always directed fat comments towards me, for example, Fat lard, lard ass, play a sport and loose some weight, I couldn&#39;t help it, I had a real slow metabolism, but they never understood that, soon after my parents had me drop out and go to a private school. I hated it, I had no friends, but atleast I didn&#39;t get bullied.
Bullying is a serious issue to me, here is a video I found on youtube about bullying:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isfn4OxCPQs

Discuss, do you think bullying is an issue? Do you agree with bullying?
I&#39;m interested to hear from all of you.</description>

<p>OT: I never really had a hard time being bullied. I have a super fast matabolism and I am 6ft 4 with size 16 feet, so no one really messes with me. I am a soccer player also so I am active, the only physical feature that I have’t had a problem with yet, is my genetic acne which I am currently on Accutane for.</p>

I got bullied throughout elementary (primary) school. Then, near the end of the school year in 6th grade, I decided enough was enough. He came over to me, pushed me out of my chair, told me to get up, I did and he pushed me again. I got up once more, grabbed the chair (plastic with metal legs), hit him across the back, and he hit the ground. I kept hitting him with it. After I was done with the chair, I started kicking him in the head.<br>

<p>That sounds like fun.<br>
How long did you get suspended?[/quote]</p>
<p>I didn’t. Teacher was out of the room (which is when the bully came over). He didn’t say anything, neither did anyone else in the class. Claimed he fell and hit his head on the  cart (held our notebooks and such.)</p>

              <p>Play football. I am fat but Linemen are supposed to be fat. You get to mess people up too. You make a name for yourself on the football team no one will mess with you. Put some muscle on in the weight room during the off season, you gain respect from the older players too. Buy a pair of nikes too. I am already big (6’4 230lb) but with a pair of nikes on, it adds another inch. Plus you get swaqqed out.</p>

              <p>I have never been bullied in my life (I’m 6ft2in 180Lb), but I have seen someone get bullied and it isn’t a joke. It can and will hurt the kid that is being bullied emotionally throughout his/her life.</p>

Sometimes fighting back make it worse, i had a small fight (more like a wrestling match) with a guy when i was in year 7. His friends walked over and i walked off because he was on the ground and it just looked really awkward, but i was bullied in primary school for being… different. When i started high school the boys were intimidated and started calling me a “man” because of how i would act although its very obvious i’m not.

I know, who would want to meet Bieber, but everyone thinks this kid is a ‘Bully Hero’<br>
Look up Casey Heynes on youtube, you will find a bunch of shit.</p>
