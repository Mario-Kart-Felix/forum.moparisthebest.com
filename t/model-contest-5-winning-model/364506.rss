That’s because there’s a majority of twelve year old’s who don’t understand the meaning of restraint. I’m rather sick of the immaturity that seems to come up in every thread.</p>

</aside>
<p>The way it goes is not supposed to be we find proof he didn’t leech, the way an accusation such as yours goes, is that <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> find proof that he did, and the accusation builds off there. You need to think about the way these things work before you accuse him, without proof, then state that he needs to get proof himself when you just made a false, as well as empty, statement.[/quote]I never said he should find the proof himself? And it’s not empty, I gave my reasons, they are just not ‘modelly’ founded.</p>

<p>Your post is correct. I cannot understand how David feels this was leeched. It honestly seems stupid to think so.</p>

Shhh David, it’s obviously been made in metasequoia, it’s not leeched, and it’s not even an extremely complex model.  Provide some real proof then sure, we’ll consider your accusations.<br>

The way it goes is not supposed to be we find proof he didn’t leech, the way an accusation such as yours goes, is that <span class="bbcode-i">you</span> find proof that he did, and the accusation builds off there. You need to think about the way these things work before you accuse him, without proof, then state that he needs to get proof himself when you just made a false, as well as empty, statement.</p>

              <p>This really isn’t hard to make at all. It had one of the better concepts, but really, look at it, it could’ve been made in under an hour, and the majority of the “spearhead’s” wireframe is a horrid mess. Also, WAAAAY to many segments were used in those rings on the model. I can just about guarantee that ~600 of the quads were just from the rings all over the model.</p>

You judge him on a model made in JUNE. Last time I checked, the amount of progress which can be made in such an extended period of time (June to October), would allow for much more progression than this. If he downloaded this model, it would surely consist of much higher quality, as well as a more professional wire frame. Jesus christ, all these accusations lately are kind of pathetic. Personally, I liked it better when the only accusations that were in this section were from CJ, who, every time he placed one, already had the download and image links for the model which was being leeched. Don’t make accusations unless you have proof, because it annoys more people than just the one who posted the model. This post is directed at EVERYONE who makes accusations without proof, and the only reason for the accusation is a comparison to a model they made months back. This is what happened to me when I first posted here, and it is NOT fun to be accused because apparently, I (in this case he) wasn’t ‘good enough’ at modeling to model what I (he) was accused for leeching. Do not respond to this with spam, or useless shit. Unless someone can post actual proof of leeching, keep it on topic, please, so that Qazz can enjoy the prize he won from the contest, as I am sure the rest of you would wish to have should you win(or have won) the contest.[/quote]If you look at the post made in June, this actually looks worse than it? Surely that large time frame would show some improvement? I am saying, based on the post in June, that it looks as if he knows nothing about modeling, and he downloads models, takes a few pictures, then releases it.</p>
<p>As for finding proof, I bid you good luck, the chances of making the exact same search as him and finding the exact same spear are astronomical.</p>
<p>And, as I said, if he can post proof that he made it, I will delete/take back my post(s), give a full apology, and post some sort of disparaging thing about myself and my experience at modeling.</p>
