    <description>Hello,
I&#39;ve followed the tut perfectly, but i don&#39;t really know which type of java i have. every time i download it, it brings me to this weird downloading program which i have a pic of, but idk what type of java it is so idk what to put in my classpath and path files

here is the pic of the download screen - [IMG]http://img374.imageshack.us/img374/7734/javathingrq9.jpg[/img]

please can someone just tell me what to put in my classpath and path files that would be great, because i keep getting a box that pops up really fast then closes when i try to run runserver.bat and it says &#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an external or internal command, something, or a batch file&quot;. my friend told me thats because my classpath and path files were wrong. please help now i want to start my server tonight.</description>
