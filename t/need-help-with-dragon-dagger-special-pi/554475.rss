    <title>Need help with Dragon Dagger special PI</title>

    <description>Hey everyone, I am having a problem with the Dragon Dagger Special on my PI source. Whenever you are fighting someone in the wild and you spec with a DDS the hit splats don&#39;t add up with what your actually hitting. for example, I spec someone and it shows I hit an 8-8 when their hp is at 99. but it that 8-8 puts their hp to like 47 from 99. and 99-16= 83. not 47 obviously.. and I was just wondering if anyone knows what I should do or look for. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Then theres a problem with either the packets the client receives from the server, the way the client interperates them or the way you handle damage being dealt. If you cant figure out what it is you need to post some code because no one can help you without any code, revision and server base.</p>

              <p>Can be a lot of different things.<br>
Try looking at the packets that the server sends to the client to show hitspats. Could also be an error with your combat system. Does it always show 8 - 8? If not, it can also be a problem with either<br>
A) your combat system<br>
B) the method that decreases the hitpoints or any other skill for that matter</p>
