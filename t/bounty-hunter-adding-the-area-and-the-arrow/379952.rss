    <title>Bounty hunter, adding the area and the arrow</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bounty-hunter-adding-the-area-and-the-arrow/379952</link>
    <description>Well, I want to add bounty hunter to my server, and I alrady have a target system and the penalty, but I do not have the bounty hunter arena in my server, can anybody give me the models and tell me how to add areas please?
Also, does anyone knows how to let an arrow appear over the target.

My Server is Delta based.


By the way, does anyone know how to make Npc using prayers like protection of Melee?</description>
