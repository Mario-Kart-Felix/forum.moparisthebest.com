<p>Thanks and good day :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 18, 2008, 12:07:04 am[/size][hr]An amendment to the original post:</p>
<p>I have spoken with the owner of Hydrascape, and he is understandably pretty pissed that we’ve felt the need to do this. I realise that in my original post I was pretty aggresive, so I should probably point out that I have no proof that there is anything going on at Hydrascape other than a group of people trying to make a successful server, and it is possible that they are 100% legit. However, given the reputation of the staff, it’s equally possible that its not.</p>
<p>So for now I’m going to say that the above post still applies, but if it is shown that I am wrong and the Hydrascape crew really have given up all the shit, then of course it will be lifted. I never said it was permanent.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 18, 2008, 12:48:41 am[/size][hr]Another amendment, wow I’m on a roll.</p>
