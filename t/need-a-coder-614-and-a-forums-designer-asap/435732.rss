Am looking at starting a RSPS which will involve PVP as well as an economy.

I have a budget of $1,000 for gold banners , advertisement fee&#39;s and a VPS I am aiming to get this server in to the top 5 RSPS&#39;s and I am most dedicated towards this project.

To achieve my aims I need the best of the best and now am asking you please do &quot;NOT&quot; reply or add my skype if you have no idea on how to code it&#39;s really starting to bug me!

Some stuff which I&#39;d be looking at having on the server.

Donator area.
Yell - Donators
Vote point system
100% staking (duel arena)
100% working prayer - mage
100% matching armour stats (Runescape)
Donator shop insisting of (Torva , pernix , spirit shields etc)
Loyalty points (donator)
Maybe a bit of PVM if your interested in adding it.
Working friends chat
Working private messaging
Effects and GFX near to Runescape as possible
Loyalty titles.. maybe every 50 kills.
Dice ranks

Note: am not interested in custom items etc.

Basically looking to create an inspirational RSPS.

I&#39;ll either pay a one off fee once you&#39;ve made it , or I&#39;ll pay a nominal fee and you can be a co-owner ( coder ) something of which I&#39;d prefer.

I also need a forum designer/administrator.

I want to see proof of your previous work so I know am not hiring a complete an utter idiot.

Now please don&#39;t pm me or add my skype if you can only code basic servers.

Pm me or add my skype &quot;ohKaizen&quot;

Thanks,

Era.</description>
