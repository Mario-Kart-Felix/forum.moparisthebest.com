    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-85-to-who-ever-can-help-me-with-my-lag-issues/348385</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sick of this - Every time I teleport (on a server I play) I dc. Every time I log in it takes over 15 mins to load. My computer is brand new - All I got on it is winrar, java, and globalpkz(server I play). I will pay $85 or give you my xbox 360 if you can help me fix this. My compuer is a compaq brand, which I have windows xp. ITS BRAND NEW, SO WHAT THE **** CAN POSSIBLY BE THE PROBLEM????</description>

</aside>
<p>if its brand new it doesnt matter how much ram its got, because it has no files on it and all new computers come with 1gb + ram. what you really want to look at is your proccesor or grapics processor.</p>
<p>and perhaps it your internet connection. if not maybe its a fualty server try another one and if it still lags then i cant help you :S</p>
