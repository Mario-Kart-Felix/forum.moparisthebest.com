    <title>Need help with Chivalry and Piety(Sprites, not function)</title>

    <description>Hi! I recently fixed a few glitches in my client, like making PK skulls white, making the Prayer star transparent and all of that and then I stumbled upon two things I could NOT fix. First of all, I needed to add Chivalry and Piety prayers in my Prayer tab. This is what I CURRENTLY HAVE IN MY CLIENT!

This is WHAT I WANT

I tried looking for those sprites but I found nothing! How could I add those icons to my client?

~~~

Also I have one thing that I will try to solve and I will ask for your help on, I don&#39;t ask you to get a headache over it, just take a quick glance at it and tell me if you know how to fix this.

I want to make it so my PK skull is ABOVE my hitpoints bar(The green bar with red fractions showing how much health you have) and my prayer headicons ABOVE the skull. Right now if I have a PK skull, nothing else it shows up just fine. But if I have a PK skull AND protection prayer on, the skull sort of &#39;sinks&#39; into my HP bar and partially my characters head. Any help on that?

Thanks A LOT!
I appreciate and comments or help of ANY kind.
