    <title>How about David Eddings?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-about-david-eddings/233478</link>
    <description>Does anyone read/know his books? Personally i&#39;ve read all of The Belgariad, The Mallorean and the books about Elenia (not sure what the english name is) about 3 times. Basically they revolve around worlds full of conflict, politics, and they he writes it, it contains a good deal of humour. Personally i think it&#39;s my second favourite author of all times, only to be beaten by Terry Pratchett.</description>
