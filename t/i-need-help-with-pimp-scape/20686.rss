              <p>well to make yourself admin open up your client.java and search for moderator. You should come up with something that says start of moderator/admin list. If you don’t, keep searching untill you find it. When you do, put your name in one of the quotes that has player rights =3 or =2. I’ll post shop stuff soon.[br][size=1]Posted at: October 29, 2006, 01:49:33 AM[/size][hr]<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,27880.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,27880.0.html</a> thanks to v i d o for that tut</p>
