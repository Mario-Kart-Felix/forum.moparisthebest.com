    <title>They finally removed that annoying landing page</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/they-finally-removed-that-annoying-landing-page/484013</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t know if anyone noticed. But they finally removed the really obnoxious and annoying landing page for http://www.runescape.com
It bothered me (yes, I&#39;m OCD like this) that you couldn&#39;t get directly in the game as a player, as fast as normal. Normally if you went to runescape.com. You&#39;d have to scroll to the very bottom, click &quot;Continue to full website&quot; and then click play now. That page no longer exists, and you don&#39;t need to go to the url: http://www.runescape.com/title.ws?=1 (How the hell I remembered that, I don&#39;t know.).
Yeah, that&#39;s all.</description>
