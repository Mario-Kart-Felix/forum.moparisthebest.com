    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tree-cutting-thing/8227</link>
    <description>I was just thinking that can I somehow make my auto willow cutter &amp; banker wait until that tree is down what it is choppng, so it finds next tree only when old tree is down?

And other question: Can i make it to find tree color itself like it finds willowcolor if there reads text &#39;Chop down Willow&#39;?</description>

              <p>What i did in my powercutter was i made it find the colour and yadda yadda then it uses IsUpTextMulti(‘Chop’,‘down’,‘Willow’) and then it would repeat findnormal randoms until((Not (IsUpTextMulti(‘Chop’,‘down’,‘Willow’))) or InvFull) (i added in other stuff this is just example)</p>
<p>that way it waits until it cant find Chop down Willow, because you move and stuff as king keen said, you could try using FindColorSpiral</p>

<p>Maybe you could make it keep checking to see in the colour of the tree is where it was last time… or use istextup to see if it says ‘chpo down’ or whatever…</p>

<p>That dosnt work to well, when you click on the tree your character might move and the camera moves slightly over time, so thats out of the question, I think.</p>
<p>Just do a wait or something…<br>
If the sound plugin worked scripts could be made more reliable, shame it dosn’t. :rolleyes:</p>
