              <p>You need to add tokens…  So that they read, write, and save to one’s character file.  You’d also have to create a line in the save file of the characters.  For a shop, you’d have to do some complicated things to connect the points to the items…  Sorry if it’s not helpful; just trying to point you in the right direction.</p>
