              <p>MADE COMPLETLY BY LOTHY</p>
<p>[code]<br>
Purpose: To add proper in-game clan supprt</p>
<p>Difficulty: 1</p>
<p>Assumed Knowledge: Being literate</p>
<p>Server Base: PvpScape</p>
<p>Classes Modified: client.java</p>
<p>Credits: Lothy - me</p>
<p>Information: After originally posting this on Moparscape on the 19 January 2007, at 17:33:17, my ClanHandler managed to do several magical things that most .java files can’t do. Firstly, it renamed itself to MuteHandler, and changed the class name inside. Secondly, I didn’t put an ounce of code to connect to anything, so again beats me how it found it’s own way here. On a serious note: Guthan’s mute handler is my work with a few words switched around; if you’re unsure, the original topic with the original post date can be found here: <a href="http://www" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www</a>.***************/smf/index…c,69031.0.html</p>
<p>Procedure<br>
Step 1: Download this file: ClanHandler.java<br>
Stupid enough, a certain site is filtered here for one reason or another. I won’t name it as I don’t know why that filtering takes place, but it’s another highly popular server community.<br>
Put it with your other .java files.</p>
<p>Make a folder in the same directory as your runserver.bat file, and call this folder “clans”, without the quotation marks.</p>
<p>Step 2: Add these with your commands:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
if (command.startsWith(“createclan”)) {<br>
try {<br>
String clanName = command.substring(11);<br>
if(!clanName.equalsIgnoreCase(“clanlist”) &amp;&amp; !clanName.equalsIgnoreCase(“tempclanlist”)) {<br>
if(server.clanHandler.checkClanExist(clanName)) {<br>
sendMessage(“Sorry, the clan you have chosen already exists!”);<br>
} else {<br>
if(clanRights == 0) {<br>
server.clanHandler.createClan(clanName, playerName);<br>
server.clanHandler.appendToClans(clanName);<br>
clanRights = 5;<br>
myClanName = clanName;<br>
sendMessage(“You have just created “+clanName+”. You are the owner”);<br>
} else {<br>
sendMessage(“You are already in a clan. You can’t be in two!”);<br>
}<br>
}<br>
} else {<br>
sendMessage(“You can not make a clan with that name!”);<br>
}<br>
} catch(Exception e) {<br>
sendMessage(“Error creating clan”);<br>
}<br>
} else if (command.startsWith(“deleteclan”)) {<br>

}Step 3: Under the line:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public class client extends Player implements Runnable {Put:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public String myClanName = “none”;<br>
public int clanRights = 0;Step 4: Search for:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
} else if (token.equals(“character-height”)) {And above that line put:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
} else if (token.equals(“character-clanRights”)) {<br>
clanRights = Integer.parseInt(token2);<br>
} else if (token.equals(“character-myClanName”)) {<br>
myClanName = token2;Step 5: Search for:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
characterfile.write("character-height = ", 0, 19);And above that line put:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
characterfile.write("character-clanRights = ", 0, 23);<br>
characterfile.write(Integer.toString(clanRights), 0, Integer.toString(clanRights).length());<br>
characterfile.newLine();<br>
characterfile.write("character-myClanName = ", 0, 23);<br>
characterfile.write(myClanName, 0, myClanName.length());<br>
characterfile.newLine();Step 6: Open up server.java and search for:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
objectHandler = new ObjectHandler();Under that line add:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
clanHandler = new ClanHandler();Next search for:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public static ObjectHandler objectHandler = null;Under that line add:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public static ClanHandler clanHandler = null;Summary:<br>
I made this last night, and after a fair bit of testing I think it works well enough to release. Basically, you use the commands in game to modify clan stuff.<br>
::createclan clannamehere - This command will create a clan. Once a clan exists, it can not be made again.</p>
<p>:eleteclan clannamehere - This command will delete a clan. You can only do this if you have clanRights &gt;= 5 though. Basically, it’s impossibly to delete somebody else’s clan as far as I’ve tried.</p>
<p>::joinclan clannamehere - This will put you on the clan list, and make you a member of the clan. As far as I’ve tried, it’s impossible to multi clan, and you can’t join another clan until you leave your current one.</p>
<p>::leaveclan clannamehere - This will remove you from the clan in question. Once you use this command, you will be able to join another clan.</p>
<p>::clanowner playerNamehere - If you own a clan, you can use this command to make another player the owner with you. Keep in mind though that this command will give that player equal authority, including the ability to delete the clan.</p>
<p>::mempromote playerNamehere - This will give a member a promotion (it makes their clanRights variable go up by one each time it’s used). Clan members with higher clanRights can in turn promote people lower then them - however, they can’t promote someone any higher then 2 levels below their own.</p>
<p>::memdemote playerNamehere - This will demote a member (it minuses their clanRights in other words). Pointless, but I figured I’d put both the ::mempromote and ::memdemote commands in just for people who wanted to delve deeper into the clanRights system - I’m sure the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>::memkick playerNamehere - Allows someone with owner status (clanRights &gt;= 5) to kick a member of the clan. However, that member must be online for this to take place. At the moment, it won’t remove the player from the list.  Sorry, but it threw exceptions like a ***** when I tried sending two variables to the void that did this job. :S</p>
<p>::whatclan playerNamehere - This command is used on other players. It will show you what clan the other person is in, and what their clanRights are in that clan.</p>
<p>::mycstats - This will show you <em>your</em> clan, and <em>your</em> clanRights in that clan. If you aren’t in a clan, it will say none, and return 0 for the clanRights.</p>
<p>::myclanlist - This will list every player on your clan list in your chat screen, one name per line (Basically, it reads straight down the .txt file and prints them to your screen via the public chat section).</p>
<p>::checklist playerNamehere - This is used to check the members of the clan another person is in. Say Billy has a clan and I want to see who’s in that clan - I type ::checklist Billy, and it will come up with “clannamehere” Members: and then it will list the members.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to note that this is heavily reliant on buffered readers and writers. I’ve made sure that the readers and writers are always closed properly. However, if you plan to implement this setup on a high traffic server, I suggest you make the class synchronized to ensure that no overwriting occurs (for example, one person tries to make the same clan as another person, and it may get overwritten, or throw an exception because the file is open - Synchronizing the class would fix this issue).</p>
<p>Anyway, have fun everyone. If you like it, be sure to leave a comment.<br>
