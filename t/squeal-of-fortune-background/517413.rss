    <title>Squeal of fortune background</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/squeal-of-fortune-background/517413</link>
    <description>I was sure it had something to do with cache pictures. So I went and changed them. It did change background (I knew it would) but it didn&#39;t FIX problem, now I think I have right pictures in right places but they are scaled wrong. Is there cache that I can download and extract those photos from?</description>
