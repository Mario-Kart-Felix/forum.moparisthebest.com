    <description>I was going to make something for rs like swift switch and i was wondering what the best language to code it in would be. 

and also i was wondering if you could make it so that you cuold run a scar script independ from the scar compiler</description>

<p>Because of course, MSVC++ is the only C++ compiler.</p>
<p>This still dosen’t change the fact there are no C++ “decompilers” either. (I know of at least one, but have you seen the code it generates? It’s far far from the original code, it looks like a monkey wrote it with half a keyboard.)</p>

<p>My point was that .net is not worse than any of them just because it happens to be developed by MS. Especially when we are talking about a non speed critical program and you recommended <span class="bbcode-i">VB</span> in the same post that you bashed .net’s performance in. (Because we all know, VB6 is a speed demon!)</p>
<blockquote>There are a lot of computer that don't have .net framework just like 15 years ago they didn't have vb6 runtimes and when you get a virus it would be like "Can't execute, go find dlls"</blockquote>
<p>This is true, however a lot of applications require .net now, chances are most people on a Windows machine have got it, or are prepared to get it. On Linux there’s always Mono, and I don’t think many people on Linux are going to be running swiftswitch clones anyway.</p>

Don’t use .net. .Net is for nubs. If you code something using the .net framework your application will run really slow. Most importantly nobody can run your applications unless they download the 400mb framework (it is probably shipped with every pc now). Here is the worst part: everyone can decompile your software easily - you are forced to obfuscate code which in the long run probably slows it down even more.</p>
<p>Just stick to c++ and vb, there is something better though that came out not a while ago: d.</p>

<p>If you don’t know what you are talking about then don’t say anything.</p>
<p>There are a lot of languages that need runtimes/frameworks. What’s your point?<br>
There are a lot of computer that don’t have .net framework just like 15 years ago they didn’t have vb6 runtimes and when you get a virus it would be like “Can’t execute, go find dlls”</p>

<p>Nah, nothing is “compiled into assembly” and assembly is not machine code.</p>
<p>Assembly is a slightly simpler representation of machine code, it gives opcodes a name and simplifies assignment and stuff so nobody has to work with long strings of binary.</p>
