<p>can you explain this a bit more to poeple who have no  clue what you are tlaking bout?<br>
[/quote]ARES, originally made by Ollie and Ace, later continued by Damnx, speljohan, and Ollie.  It’s a BCEL bot, and it was very good when it first came out.  RS updated, and it all went downhill(IMO).<br>
Ollie doesn’t have the time needed to keep updating it every time that RS updates and breaks one of the hooks, so he has passed it on to ruler and GenodemoN to continue working on it.  They now released it as ARES on neXus, and it costs $30.<br>
It is currently in beta 2.3, its last beta stage.</p>
<p>No one is too sure right now that what joey is stating is legit…</p>

</aside>
<p>No its in 2.52 beta continued by ruler and Ollie, sold in neXus pro.<br>
It was originally made by Ollie and Ace.<br>
The it died.<br>
Ollie sold it to ruler.<br>
Then Speljohan, Damnx, and Ollie revived it as Ares 2 or AresBot Revived or Reborn.<br>
Then Ollie decided to quit again.<br>
Ollie then joined development of it with ruler as a reflection bot not a bytecode bot.<br>
Speljohan then started with maclof on Zaveo.<br>
Spel and maclof are now working on a completely brand new bot.<br>
With two parts:<br>
The actual bot, ZaveoBot,<br>
and the Core API, used by other people to make their own bots and for scripting.<br>
I am currently the third person so when they need help I try and help.[/quote]</p>
<p>i never sold it to ruler, i gave it to him to use in nexus</p>

can you explain this a bit more to poeple who have no  clue what you are tlaking bout?<br>
[/quote]ARES, originally made by Ollie and Ace, later continued by Damnx, speljohan, and Ollie.  It’s a BCEL bot, and it was very good when it first came out.  RS updated, and it all went downhill(IMO).<br>
Ollie doesn’t have the time needed to keep updating it every time that RS updates and breaks one of the hooks, so he has passed it on to ruler and GenodemoN to continue working on it.  They now released it as ARES on neXus, and it costs $30.<br>
It is currently in beta 2.3, its last beta stage.</p>
<p>No one is too sure right now that what joey is stating is legit…[/quote]</p>
<p>No its in 2.52 beta continued by ruler and Ollie, sold in neXus pro.<br>
It was originally made by Ollie and Ace.<br>
The it died.<br>
Ollie sold it to ruler.<br>
Then Speljohan, Damnx, and Ollie revived it as Ares 2 or AresBot Revived or Reborn.<br>
Then Ollie decided to quit again.<br>
Ollie then joined development of it with ruler as a reflection bot not a bytecode bot.<br>
Speljohan then started with maclof on Zaveo.<br>
Spel and maclof are now working on a completely brand new bot.<br>
With two parts:<br>
The actual bot, ZaveoBot,<br>
and the Core API, used by other people to make their own bots and for scripting.<br>
I am currently the third person so when they need help I try and help.</p>
