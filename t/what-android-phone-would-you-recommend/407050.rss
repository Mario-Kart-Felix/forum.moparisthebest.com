    <title>What Android phone would you recommend?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-android-phone-would-you-recommend/407050</link>
    <description>Hey all.

I&#39;ve always been a fan of the Android OS, and I love the phones that are offered with Android, but I am unfortunately at a enpass determining which phone is best for me.

I love apps and such. The Android market surely has that, along with some useful apps that can really help with menial tasks. I&#39;m looking for a phone for work and play! A phone that can handle a lot of apps running, but also has support for comic-relief.

I&#39;m not really asking much. I&#39;m just asking which phone do you think would be best for me. What experiences have you had with Android phones and would you recommend them?

Thanks.

Oh, and if it means anything, my phone service provider is currently T-Mobile.</description>

              <p>I don’t know, Sense alone cheapens HTC phones quite a bit. Full of those gimmicky widgets and ridiculous animations, reminds me of that poorly designed, gimmicky KDE rubbish. I mean, I’d take stock Android over that any day. But I’d settle for TouchWiz on Samsung phones.</p>

Hardware wise yes, but aesthetically I think the galaxy S2 looks cheap, just like that basic tocco lite that everyone seemed to get for christmas last year with an added paint job.</p>

<p>i just recommend if you get an android phone know your getting what u pay for, so the higher end android phones are going to have decent to great performance, if you get a cheap one like a samsung moment or intercept expect sluggish performance everynow and then, bad battery life, etc. the only reason i can put up with my current pos phone is wireless tethering if it couldnt do that id just consider it a brick. im considering putting a alpha version of cm6 on it, ive seen performance nearly double.</p>

<p>No.[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:2, topic:407050”]Any android phone will work fine for what you listed, they all run the same apps.</p>
<p>The things you have to consider is what you want hardware-wise.  Do you want a physical keyboard? (I do)  Do you want a large screen? (it’s bigger) or a small phone?  Need an HDMI port?  What about the camera?  Do you want a flash or to be able to record in 720p?  Those are the things you have to consider.</p>
<p>Personally, I want the new Droid 3, but only if Motorola provides a bootloader unlocking option like they promised.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh my, all of which you said sound very nice. What I am mainly looking for though is an Android phone that can handle a lot of apps running at once, and is very flexible. I heard some good reviews about the MyTouch 4G and the HTC EVO, but I’m not entirely sure.</p>
<p>What have you used?</p>

              <p>Hey all.</p>
<p>I’ve always been a fan of the Android OS, and I love the phones that are offered with Android, but I am unfortunately at a enpass determining which phone is best for me.</p>
<p>I love apps and such. The Android market surely has that, along with some useful apps that can really help with menial tasks. I’m looking for a phone for work and play! A phone that can handle a lot of apps running, but also has support for comic-relief.</p>
<p>I’m not really asking much. I’m just asking which phone do you think would be best for me. What experiences have you had with Android phones and would you recommend them?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, and if it means anything, my phone service provider is currently T-Mobile.</p>
