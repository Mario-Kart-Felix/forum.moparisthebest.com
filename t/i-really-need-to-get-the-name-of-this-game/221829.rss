    <title>I really need to get the name of this game!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-really-need-to-get-the-name-of-this-game/221829</link>
    <description>Please help me, i have played it 1.5yr ago and it was super great game i really loved it, but now i want to play it and i completely forgot it&#39;s name.

There were functions like you had a PROGRAM: Knife, its options can hack, move 3 squares or so.

Catapult, shoot 5 squares or so.

I can even drew up a quick pic.

And I think it begins of letter O (10% only sure..)

But its like computer hacking just a game, you can buy programs off shops like KNIFE, CATAPULT and so you battle in arenas.

And i remember BOSS had function SHUTDOWN it deleted 20 spaces near him.

If someone played it tell me the name or a link please I&#39;m dying to play it again, i just told you what i remember off it..!! :)</description>
