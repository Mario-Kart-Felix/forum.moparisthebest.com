I want a team because I thought the development was slow and I would always delete something I had spent a while one just because it wouldn&#39;t work and I would doubt my abilities. Along with being bored. I don&#39;t have money for a website/vps and I wouldn&#39;t be able to run it on my computer to save my life (literally) 448MB, so maybe one of the developers could run the server on the computer until (if) we choose to accept donations.
