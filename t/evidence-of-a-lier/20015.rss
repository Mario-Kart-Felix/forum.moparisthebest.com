    <title>Evidence of a lier</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/evidence-of-a-lier/20015</link>
    <description>I have been good friends with cowie as you may know him here over the last month maybe, but the last two days he has brought this friendship to the dumpster.
Here is my hard strong evidence i have on him.

4 days ago i restarted runescape after a very long time, he insisted to me and fury that he was getting free runescape cash with a cc generator.
So i thought hey, this sounds good :). I refused many times to accept this file and try it myself.
I asked if he could get me some money...

The next day

I kept asking if he could get me some money and he kept consistantly sending me this program and i kept declining.


Today

He told myself and flamed fury that he bought an account with some money that he bought with his cc generator. 
He told us that he payed 9.5mill for it.
Here is a logged chat i had with him over msn

™°°°♫♂BigMac♂♫°°°™---- says:
Ah you are messed in the head.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And the picture he sent me is this ...



Note the many mistakes that proves it is no way on an actual rs screen.
I&#39;m sad to end this friendship but i did on the first day say to him &quot; look i know this is rubbish just own up to it i know you can&#39;t do this &quot;
But he insisted otherwise.

              <p>I have been good friends with cowie as you may know him here over the last month maybe, but the last two days he has brought this friendship to the dumpster.<br>
Here is my hard strong evidence i have on him.</p>
<p>4 days ago i restarted runescape after a very long time, he insisted to me and fury that he was getting free runescape cash with a cc generator.<br>
So i thought hey, this sounds good :). I refused many times to accept this file and try it myself.<br>
I asked if he could get me some money…</p>
<p>The next day</p>
<p>I kept asking if he could get me some money and he kept consistantly sending me this program and i kept declining.</p>
<p>Today</p>
<p>He told myself and flamed fury that he bought an account with some money that he bought with his cc generator.<br>
He told us that he payed 9.5mill for it.<br>
Here is a logged chat i had with him over msn</p>

<p>And the picture he sent me is this …</p>
<p>Note the many mistakes that proves it is no way on an actual rs screen.<br>
I’m sad to end this friendship but i did on the first day say to him " look i know this is rubbish just own up to it i know you can’t do this "<br>
But he insisted otherwise.</p>
