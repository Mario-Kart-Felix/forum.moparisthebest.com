    <title>Report Abuse Button [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/report-abuse-button-pi/552045</link>
    <description>Wasn&#39;t sure if this was client sided or Server sided, so I will just leave it here in Server help section. I need to know how/where the report abuse interface is opened. I wish to change the button&#39;s purpose, and I want it to launch a new interface rather than the report abuse interface. I have already changed the text on the button, which was easy to find, but I cannot find where the interface for the report abuse (5875) is launched. Any help finding the proper class to look in, or just simply how to change it?</description>

I honestly do not know why they would make a feature such as this client sided, because then it can be manipulated. (You can change it so you’re “mod” and then it gives you the power to mute)<br>
But server sided checks would also prevent that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>The easiest way to find where the interface is opened, would be to search for this string:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>You should get something like this:</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
if (j2 != -1)<br>
if (openInterfaceID == -1) {<br>
clearTopInterfaces();<br>
reportAbuseInput = s2.substring(j2 + 5).trim();<br>
canMute = false;<br>
for (int i3 = 0; i3 &lt; RSInterface.interfaceCache.length; i3++) {<br>
if (RSInterface.interfaceCache[i3] == null<br>
|| RSInterface.interfaceCache[i3].contentType != 600)<br>
continue;<br>
reportAbuseInterfaceID = openInterfaceID = RSInterface.interfaceCache[i3].parentID;<br>
break;<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>			} else {
				pushMessage("Please close the interface you have open before using 'report abuse'", 0, "");
			}[/code]</code></pre>
