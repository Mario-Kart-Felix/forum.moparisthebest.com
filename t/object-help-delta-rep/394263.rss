    <description>Hey everyone, Andrew here with a quick question for you server buffs. Im currently working on my Project Cleanup development again for release later on and I need a little help with this. I&#39;m trying to find out how some servers desplay the cords and object ID for stuff and the interface ID for buttons on the server (Look below). If anyone could help me with this or give me a snipplet for it I would love you and it would make my development come out a lot sooner. Anyways, thanks for helping and or looking at this.
