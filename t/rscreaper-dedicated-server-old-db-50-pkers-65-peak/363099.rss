    <description>Ever dreamed of playing a decent RSC-server without big hassle such as wasting hours on finding account creation on those tricky websites and then finally registering yourself a character to play on-line?

Your troubles are gone, because a new server has launched - RSCReaper! This is a server for people who want to take a time out, relax while playing and not hassle for stats-items or anything like that.

Well, there are various ways to make money. You might notice there is a guy handing out free tunas at edge. Maybe you should go over him and look what he has to offer. Sell these into general shops for GP. NB! Shops will pay money for tunas only for a little while, in a few days or so you can no longer make money off tunas. :)
You can also pickpocket which is really rich in GP and also on experience. You might get up to 800 gp each per NPC as you reach higher levels + various other loot!

Few tips: 
* If you die, you will respawn at Lumbridge. I&#39;m keeping it that way for now. You may use ::stuck command to get back to Edgeville
* To get to Catherby really fast, go to Al Shabim, ask him to take you to Ardougne, there go by boat to Catherby
* Dragons drop rune and dragon items! So look around in wildy for red dragons and 

Few sneak-peak screenshots:

The rates are quite high at the moment, abit over 20x, but this will be only for really a while so try to take from this advantage what you can! After a while it will be lowered abit. There will also be such thing as &quot;Rush-Hours&quot; when experience multiplier automatically raises 1.5x.

It might not yet be the closest RSC Replica, but I am giving my best to develop it into one.
I am also planning many events on holidays(such as Christmas, Easter, Halloween) and also random Hide-and-Seek-return-to-get-a-Prize events will not be uncommon. :)

I have alot of free time aside of my highschool studies and I have enough to spare on newcomers, who need assistance or support.

What I have added is most of the Agility - all Arenas and all obstacles are climbable-usable. Feel free to run through gnome courses or explore Wilderness Agility Course. Also lots of minor updates to make you feel like you are playing something very close to Real-RSC. E.g. making pizzas-pies, hitting dummies and lots of other things. Dragons drop dragon and rune items.
When you range a monster it will attack you.

I haven&#39;t added forums [b]yet[/b], I might add them as soon as there are some active players around. No point on forums with 2 active users and 3 posts, eh? :)

I am currently alone in the staff but I&#39;m keeping open eye for any qualified players who might be perfect for staff job.
