    <title>PvP on Pwnscape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvp-on-pwnscape/317676</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this. Now I own a PwnScape based server, which i&#39;m sure is Delta. Now I&#39;d like to know how I can actually change the server to PvP. I know how to make like people be able to attack people anywhere. But how do you make the safe spots? the drops? and the levels in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen?(example Levels 113-120)
and also I was thinking, since i&#39;m releasing a beta version of my server to my friends I wanted to make two clients. One is the PvP one and one is the normal one. But how would I make the PvP one work with the characters? (explanation: when a player moves/gets an item in one of these clients how would I make it update the character&#39;s file for both servers? Like they&#39;re all linked to one char folder)
Thank you very much for reading :P please respond or at least try to help. :cool:</description>

              <p>Hmm That might be something under client.java or player.java. Also check playerhandler.java… I don’t really work with pvp but I think that might help. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
