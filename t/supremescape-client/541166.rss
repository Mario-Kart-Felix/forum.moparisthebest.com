    <description>Supremescape is a server made and created by khenz (credit to jake for the source) also know as Jc fire. We strive to offer our player base the best and funnest content we can add. So we are constantly adding more content at all times!  are desperately in need of staff since launch was today 3/13/14. We offer alot to our players outside the server itself.
