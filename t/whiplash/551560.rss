    <description>A bit late for this, but I just saw it and boy was it good. This is one of my favorite movies now.


They really nailed the suspense and you could feel the pain of the drummer.


EDIT: Also I loved J.K Simmons&#39; creative use of profanity to insult the band members.


EDIT_2: Also loved the song &quot;Caravan&quot; and the time signature in &quot;Whiplash&quot; was good (14/8 if you&#39;re interested).</description>

              <p>I was told I HAD to see this movie and thought it was over-hyped. The plot was interesting and suspenseful as you said, but the amount of cussing was more annoying than promoting. Definitely not the best movie I’ve seen and definitely not the worst.</p>

              <p>I watched it a month or two ago. It was a really great movie. I wouldn’t really say it’s full of suspense but it is definitely very INtense</p>
