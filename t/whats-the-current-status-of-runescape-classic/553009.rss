    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m an old fan of RSC from about 15 years ago, and I&#39;ve recently discovered this little community. I&#39;m just trying to gauge where things stand currently. From what I can gather, a handful of people are still around, and there are lots of different servers floating around, all with their own unique features, generally ones that try to liven the game up a bit with faster XP gain and an emphasis on PvP and clans. Does this sound about right?

Most of the links I&#39;ve found are dead, but I did manage to find a copy of the source code for EasyRSC&#39;s client and server. There were a few problems with it, but I finally managed to get it up and running for myself. It looks pretty true to the original game, with a few odd features added and a new login screen, etc.

I&#39;ve been trying to work out where the source code has actually come from. A lot of it looks like it has been decompiled due to the lack of comments and variable names. And since a lot of functionality is missing from the server, presumably much of the source was obtained from an early version, and it&#39;s been added to over the years in an attempt to bring it more in line with the official servers?

Anyway, I&#39;m just curious - does anyone still play RSC? What servers do people generally play on? And what features do you look for in a server?

Personally I&#39;m trying to bring this source code back to a more vanilla state, but that&#39;s mainly just for personal use.

Cheers,
Danjb</description>

              <p>Thanks brwn - it certainly seems that way.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I think I have everything I need for now to continue my own development. Currently I’m just refactoring the code and trying to get a better understanding of the various variables and data structures. The main problem I’ve found is that player movement is very slow and stuttery; I click somewhere, and the player moves a few steps and a time and keeps pausing along the way. I’d like to make this smoother so that the movement is constant.</p>
<p>Other things on my “wishlist”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better camera control (someone has tried to add zooming but it’s a bit broken).</li>
<li>Option to change resolution in-game.</li>
<li>Get the XP rate back to normal.</li>
<li>Fix missing NPC / object behaviour.</li>
<li>Fix various typos.</li>
<li>“In-game” landscape editor.</li>
<li>RS2-style equipment menu.</li>
<li>Somehow make it more fun to play over a LAN…</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, all the reply’s you received on this topic is the current status of RSC at least on moparscape, I’m sure other boards too.<br>
Its hard to find any help, or have any question answered.</p>
<p>But yes the community is small, and split.<br>
I’ve played most of the servers that are online today, its really about which you like best.</p>
<p>As far as continuing with easyrsc or any kind of RSC development, based on my personal attempts, it is hard to find help/ask questions on these forums.</p>

Honestly do no use Mopar as starting template.</p>
<p>It uses scala and isn’t of the best to start any type of learning.</p>
<p>Use Java 8 and try Elysium, RSCA or RSCD v25 and learn about the bugs and fix them.</p>

              <p>Welcome… well the client is decompiled and almost every private server comes from the leaked source of rscdaemon that was made by Reines author of skulltorcha (an old rsc bot) and that’s about it.

              <p>By rsc if you mean the official servers? Since jagex kind of locked them up i cant imagine too much activity there, not to mention that bots are free to roam about over there.</p>
<p>As for here? I think theres a few servers still going good but dont take my word for it, though one thing i have noticed is that theres alot of bad blood between servers/suspicious ownership of servers</p>

              <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I’m an old fan of RSC from about 15 years ago, and I’ve recently discovered this little community. I’m just trying to gauge where things stand currently. From what I can gather, a handful of people are still around, and there are lots of different servers floating around, all with their own unique features, generally ones that try to liven the game up a bit with faster XP gain and an emphasis on PvP and clans. Does this sound about right?</p>
<p>Most of the links I’ve found are dead, but I did manage to find a copy of the source code for EasyRSC’s client and server. There were a few problems with it, but I finally managed to get it up and running for myself. It looks pretty true to the original game, with a few odd features added and a new login screen, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to work out where the source code has actually come from. A lot of it looks like it has been decompiled due to the lack of comments and variable names. And since a lot of functionality is missing from the server, presumably much of the source was obtained from an early version, and it’s been added to over the years in an attempt to bring it more in line with the official servers?</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m just curious - does anyone still play RSC? What servers do people generally play on? And what features do you look for in a server?</p>
<p>Personally I’m trying to bring this source code back to a more vanilla state, but that’s mainly just for personal use.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Danjb</p>
