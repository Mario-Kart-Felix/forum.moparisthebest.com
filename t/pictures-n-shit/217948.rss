    <description>I got a new camera recently, so that means I&#39;m an amazing photographer and have amazing artistic sense, right?

<p>I don’t see how your posts are bad. They’re just as bad as mine. I still don’t understand why everyone says I’m turning into you. I’ve been here longer than you. And only by a little. They can go back and look at my old posts and see I’m the same way I am now, as I was then.[/quote]</p>

              <p>[quote=“jme, post:22, topic:217948”]Well I know a lot about photography…</p>
<p>I think this is your best:<br>
<a href="http://j0nny0000.deviantart.com/art/Evening-Wind-90882010" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://j0nny0000.deviantart.com/art/Evening-Wind-90882010</a><br>
There’s a few reasons why. The rule of thirds is used in several ways. When your subject is in the dead center, it tends to be boring. Notice how the wind turbines are to the right third of the picture… And also the same is with your horizon. When the horizon is in the dead center, it’s just less flattering and doesn’t look as good. In this picture your horizon is in the lower third. This puts great emphasis on the sky and gives it a sense of freedom. This would be better if you had some more clouds, especially dramatic clouds. I’m only into black and white photography though, so even without clouds it does look nice being able to see the gradients of color in the sky. The sun is also in the left third. Typically you want to avoid lens flare but if it’s on purpose you can have some nice effects from it. I see a lot of elements and principles of design, and your composition is great. Now there kind of is a problem with exposure with it, but the silhouette does good with this imo. Because the sun is infront of you, it will trick your cameras light meter into thinking there is more light then what there really is. If you wanted to show your wind turbines and the landscape instead of the silhouette, you would need to let in more light. I don’t know if you have a manual camera though.</p>
<p>There’s a million rules you can follow in photography though, and the best pictures are usually the ones that break the rules.</p>
<p>But yeah all of these are basically snapshots. If your school offers photography courses, you should take them.[/quote]<br>
Thanks for the tips, I appreciate it. I can change all the settings on my camera, there is a “manual” mode which lets you set the aperture and stuff, but I never really took the time to learn how to use it properly. I’ll look into that a bit more. As for the lens flare, it wasn’t really intentional nor unintentional, but I think it looks rather nice. If there were clouds, they would be in the picture, but there were absolutely none to be seen in the sky.<br>
Thanks again for the tips and ideas <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Well I know a lot about photography…</p>
<p>I think this is your best:<br>
<a href="http://j0nny0000.deviantart.com/art/Evening-Wind-90882010" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://j0nny0000.deviantart.com/art/Evening-Wind-90882010</a><br>
There’s a few reasons why. The rule of thirds is used in several ways. When your subject is in the dead center, it tends to be boring. Notice how the wind turbines are to the right third of the picture… And also the same is with your horizon. When the horizon is in the dead center, it’s just less flattering and doesn’t look as good. In this picture your horizon is in the lower third. This puts great emphasis on the sky and gives it a sense of freedom. This would be better if you had some more clouds, especially dramatic clouds. I’m only into black and white photography though, so even without clouds it does look nice being able to see the gradients of color in the sky. The sun is also in the left third. Typically you want to avoid lens flare but if it’s on purpose you can have some nice effects from it. I see a lot of elements and principles of design, and your composition is great. Now there kind of is a problem with exposure with it, but the silhouette does good with this imo. Because the sun is infront of you, it will trick your cameras light meter into thinking there is more light then what there really is. If you wanted to show your wind turbines and the landscape instead of the silhouette, you would need to let in more light. I don’t know if you have a manual camera though.</p>
<p>There’s a million rules you can follow in photography though, and the best pictures are usually the ones that break the rules.</p>
<p>But yeah all of these are basically snapshots. If your school offers photography courses, you should take them.</p>

<p>I do not understand why everyone says I am turning into someone else. I have always been the way I am now. And you can check my posts to find proof. I’ve been here just as long as goatee, give or take 2 days. I’m almost sure. So I am not influenced by any single person. I am my own person, with my own personality. I didn’t freak out, but I like to settle things in private. Rather than make a public spectacle of it. Especially since this topic is about Unhandled’s work.</p>

<p>For one thing, you’ve never seen my work. Second, that wasn’t funny at all. If you have some personal issue with me. Take it up in Private Message, but don’t try and deface my credibility. I may not have treated Unhandled kindly with his work. But for you to take up your personal issues with me in every topic I post in, isn’t how you should go about this. I would be happy to discuss with you any issues you have with me. In PM.</p>
