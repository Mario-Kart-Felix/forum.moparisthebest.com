hey everyone, I&#39;m back.  
 
                 I would like to start off by saying hi and that i missed when classic had a steady low amount of players enjoying the server.  I would like to bring Classic back to life. More importantly keeping everyone involved on how the game should be developed and let their suggestions have a chance at being implemented into the game. 
 
The world would consist of F2p land with the exception of under Edgeville.  Alot of the P2p aspects on the p2p have been brought over to the f2p land as people that have played before know. Example, 2hander seller, fishing guild, ect ect.
 
 
 
Combat stats would be 30x.
 
Skilling stats would be 10x.
 (or discuss here or on classic site)
 
 
Everything else would be debated upon.  
 
*Please leave some feedback and spread the word for people that may be interested in playing again or for the first time here at Classic.  
 
 
 
Thanks for looking guys and i believe that we can get a player involved server developed again like classic was.</description>
