    <title>New Command guide [never released before]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-command-guide-never-released-before/166979</link>
    <description>[code]Intro:Hello people of mopar, today I think its time that I should release my guide to creating a new command. Have any of you ever wanted to type a command i.e. ::myset that automatically puts your armor on for you? Well in this guide I&#39;m going to explain how to and how it works.
Requirements:A source with a client.java
Difficulty:3/10
Knowledge needed:Understanding where to add ID&#39;s.

Step 1:Lets start off with creating the command name:
::myset

We would create the basic command:[code] if (command.startsWith(&quot;myset&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2) {[/code]
and instead of simply making an addItem(blah blah,1); We&#39;re going to specify which items we want to go onto our character.

[u]Step 2:[/u]This part is pretty self explanitory, you simply add the correct item i.e. 4151(abyssal whip) into the playerWeapon spot
[code] playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=4151;[/code]
You repeat this for all other armor you want your character to equip.

Heres what my custom command looks like:

[code]playerEquipment[playerHat]=1042;
      playerEquipment[playerCape]=14089;
      playerEquipment[playerAmulet]=14573;
      playerEquipment[playerChest]=14567;
      playerEquipment[playerShield]=3840;
      playerEquipment[playerLegs]=14570;
      playerEquipment[playerHands]=775;
      playerEquipment[playerFeet]=1837;
      playerEquipment[playerRing]=773;
      playerEquipment[playerArrows]=-1;
      playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=14558;[/code]

The playerEquipment[playerWeapon] and the others are changing the  the items on your character (Note: this is the same process as modifying starting armor)

Note:If you don&#39;t want any item in that spot, simply put in -1 like I did with my arrows

[u]Step3:[/u]Now that you have chosen the equipment you want to be update onto your character, we need to make it so that your equipment spots are also changed. We would use this:
[code]setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerHat], 1,
            playerHat);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerCape], 1,
            playerCape);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerAmulet],
            1, playerAmulet);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerArrows],
            1, playerArrows);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerChest],
            1, playerChest);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerShield],
            1, playerShield);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerLegs], 1,
            playerLegs);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerHands],
            1, playerHands);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerFeet], 1,
            playerFeet);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerRing], 1,
            playerRing);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerWeapon],
            1, playerWeapon);[/code]
What the setEquipment does it: adds the items into your equipment spots (without it you would have the armor you were previously wearing before you typed the command in your equipment spots, put your character appearance would be your new set)

Note:as a reminder, do NOT change the 1 to any other number.

[u]Step 4:[/u]We&#39;re almost done. All is good up to the point where we need something to update your characters appearance. Thats why we use these two little guys:
[code]updateRequired = true;
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;[/code]

The updateRequired = true; and the appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
are used to update your characters appearance. Without these you would have to log out then back in for your command to take effect.

You would add those at the bottom of your command just before the last [b]}[/b].

Heres what a complete command with all of the components together should look like:

if (command.startsWith(&quot;xmaset&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {


      playerEquipment[playerHat]=1038;
      playerEquipment[playerCape]=14095;
      playerEquipment[playerAmulet]=14574;
      playerEquipment[playerChest]=14568;
      playerEquipment[playerShield]=3844;
      playerEquipment[playerLegs]=14528;
      playerEquipment[playerHands]=6153;
      playerEquipment[playerFeet]=15352;
      playerEquipment[playerRing]=-1;
      playerEquipment[playerArrows]=-1;
      playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=4151;
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerHat], 1,
            playerHat);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerCape], 1,
            playerCape);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerAmulet],
            1, playerAmulet);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerArrows],
            1, playerArrows);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerChest],
            1, playerChest);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerShield],
            1, playerShield);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerLegs], 1,
            playerLegs);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerHands],
            1, playerHands);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerFeet], 1,
            playerFeet);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerRing], 1,
            playerRing);
      setEquipment(playerEquipment[playerWeapon],
            1, playerWeapon);

updateRequired = true;
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}[/code]

All you have to do now is find the ID&#39;s of your items, plug them into the correct places and....

[b][u]Step 5:[/u][/b]COMPILE! and then try out your new command.
