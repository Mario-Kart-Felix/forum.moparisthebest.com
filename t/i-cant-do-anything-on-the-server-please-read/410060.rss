              <p>You must have started playing while the server was messed up. From what I remember, Moparisthebest said that the server ran out of memory. So I believe this caused the character files not to save, and it wasn’t asking anyone to log on when they got on. If you started playing yesterday between about 5AM and 8PM Eastern time, what you did might have been lost. =/</p>
<p>To log in, go to your profile and at the top it says “modify profile” wait for menu to drop down, and click “forum profile”, Scroll down to the bottom, and the second to last box for you to fill it says “Minecraft name” Choose a name you like, and then open up minecraft, put that name in for username, and your password is the password on the forums.</p>
<p>Sorry about what happened with your account, it happened with a bunch of people yesterday, but I hope this helps. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
