    <title>Weird glitches</title>

    <description>My server is the 562/659 Project Dung. Server base.
SPOON FEEDING WOULD BE NICE, I BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE THESE OUT FOR AWHILE:

I have a couple glitches:
1st: Sometimes when i attack people with a weapon it will look like your praying and you go down on your knees.

2nd: Range does not hit high. I&#39;m trying to raise the range accuracy so it actually hits but its not working. Any ideas on how to change what range hits, please let me know

3rd: Dragon claws hit max hp at the last special. (fourth special)</description>
