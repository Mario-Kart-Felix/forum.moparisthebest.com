<p>I wish everyone would donate for better uptime of the server, but I don’t believe that that will work.</p>

This. But sadly, from experience, people don’t seem to donate unless they get something OP.</p>

<p>Exactly, but I don’t know how I’d feel on selling rares.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Then don’t make them tradeable so they don’t become rares? Or create your own cosmetic items for people to use?[/quote]<br>
Well on the note of the second thing, customs should die. Customs in a server make me sick and I turn away instantly.<br>
But yeah, removing trade would make them rares but I feel that it ruins the fun too.</p>
