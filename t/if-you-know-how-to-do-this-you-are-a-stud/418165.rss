    <description>Ok, so I have my highscores up and running... and when you go to my highscores, the overall page loads all the characters and their total scores and everything else, but when you go to actually click on a players name to find out personal scores, nothing loads up except the total score, and their ranking. also if i just go click the attack tab, or strength tab, no players loads up on that. The characters only show up on the main page... which is the highscores.php page. If you know how to fix, please let me Know thanks... Pm me if you would like to see what i&#39;m talking about, and I can send you the address to my highscores.  :)</description>
