    <title>First day of AP Comp Sci</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-day-of-ap-comp-sci/546278</link>
    <description>Well today was the first day of AP Comp Sci for me. One thing I&#39;m sure a few of you will like (lare69, Strucker, Pure_, and Davidi2) is that we are going to be using Eclipse! Finally, I will be learning to use it.


One thing that bothered me was that the teacher said &quot;You can&#39;t code on Macs.&quot; I was quite genuinely surprised by his statement because it&#39;s totally incorrect. I&#39;ve been coding for like a year now and I&#39;ve done it all on Mac.


Problem with this class is that it&#39;s not even a real challenging course. It&#39;s basically &quot;Take this class if you dont know jack shit about coding!&quot;
Well over three fourths of the class doesnt know how to code which really sucks shit.


Overall I like it tho, teacher is funny, easy A, etc..</description>

on campus students obviously do their work on campus in the tutorials/lectures, and the only software they are allowed to use is emacs… I follow the tutorials/lecture notes, but code in IntelliJ and external students submit their work to the professor via ftp… geddit?[/quote]</p>

It’s really easy. Just watch a series on youtube and they’ll guide you through it. I stopped using Unity for the time being because it doesn’t support java, only javascript, C# and ‘Boo’ which I have no clue what that is.</p>

Emacs is great. Although when it comes to Java I whole heartedly have to go with IntelliJ IDEA. My teacher doesn’t let the oncampus students code in anything but emacs apparently, but given I have an external student and just submit my work via ftp, I just write my code in IntelliJ and copy it over haha</p>

Just download it and watch “Brackeys” unity survival game series on youtube. And Unity’s UI is very clean and easy to understand, and by hovering over things, it tells you in simple english what it does.</p>

main reason would be that osx actually has a real terminal<br>
[/quote]What would I need to use the OSX terminal for that I can’t in windows that is relevant to how ‘easy’ it is to program, and isn’t already handled in tools I use anyway (like eclipse handling git, etc). It’s nice that the terminal is there, but when I’m going to be using a third party program because it has more features anyway (putty, filezilla or w/e), it’s not really as relevant.</p>

[/quote]Ok, setting up the environment can be an advantage. Unless of course you want to do any development with .NET <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> But even then, when you take into account time developing vs time setting up the environment, it’s not really a big factor.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for web dev tools, is that really a Mac advantage? There are a lot of good web dev tools that arent OSX specific <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> UI is preference so that’s not really an ‘advantage’ overall.[/quote]clearly windows is turing complete too, so if you want to look at it that way then sure it’s just “UI preference”. I know I’d rather get shit done than piss around with windows (and I’m not just being a fanboy, I used windows for about 10 years until I used a mac and realised the error of my ways)</p>
