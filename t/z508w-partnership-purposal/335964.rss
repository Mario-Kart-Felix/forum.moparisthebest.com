    <title>Z508w Partnership Purposal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/z508w-partnership-purposal/335964</link>
    <description>[size=14pt][B]Introduction[/B][/size]
Some may know me, and most may not, but more of you may know Zach and especially his base Z508. I am Win, Zach&#39;s partner throughout the production of the server. We have known each other for roughly 2 years and have been progressing in an on-going project known as Z508 (more currently known as Z508w). I have been supporting him on the server not through coding, but deeply in the conceptual elements of the server, which is difficult to describe or recognize.

[B][size=14pt]Situation[/SIZE][/B]
Unfortunately, changes in Zach&#39;s agenda has disrupted the progress of the server. Lost in interest and real life situations has deemed him no longer willing to continue the project after many tries at reattempting. However, I am still hoping to complete the project as planned with utmost motivation that I&#39;ve had since the beginning of the project and continual evolution of core-concepts.

[size=20pt][B]Server Development[/B][/SIZE]
He and I have gone far in progression of programming one of the most known private server for its achievements in PvP-mechanics that is now being used by others as bases for their own personal private servers. We particularly focused on the PvP aspect of the game, reproducing the most popular PK&#39;ing mechanics in the game and also integrating all other aspects of the game to focus on PvP-attraction fully. We are known for our efforts in creating unique original content through core-concepts (like mentioned above) rather then random &quot;cool&quot; ideas picked out, thus, being able to preserve the essence of PvP so widely appreciated by RuneScape players.

Just to name off a few of the features that Z508 is/will be known for:

[ul][li] Unparallel PvP mechanics*:[/li]
[li][list][li] Perfected combat formulations unraveled through hours of relentless testing in actual RuneScape.[/li][/list][/li][/ul]

[I]We believe to be the [B]only[/B] ones with a near-100% accuracy in various formulas proven by tested data.[/I]

[ul][li] Extensive research of all aspects of PvP.[/li]
[li] Strives for a completely bug-free environment.[/li]
[li] Professional grammatical orchestrations to all expressions and phrases included in-game and out.[/li]
[li] Unmatched severity in core-concept enforcements, resulting in:[/li]
[li][list][li] Multilateral relations with all aspects of the game.[/li][/list][/li]
[li][list][li] Extreme focus on recreating original content while picking out all flaws and impracticalities.[/li][/list][/li]
[li][list][li] Concentrated development of server to achieve absolute perfection.[/li][/list][/li]
[li][list][li] Personality and community involvement; user-friendly.[/li][/list][/li]
[li][list][li] Solid philosophies and foundations for the betterment of the server progression.[/li][/list][/li][/ul]

[I]*Itself involving uncountable features.[/I]

[size=14pt][B]Experiences[/B] (for partner)[/SIZE]
So, with the project coming close to an end, I&#39;m hoping to revive it by partnering up with someone willing, capable, trusted, and reliable in Java programming: Someone who can work in a [B]business-like manner[/B], has [B]extensive knowledge in Java programming[/B] as well as [B]good experiences in RuneScape&#39;s game mechanics[/B]. (More of being able to translate it into code. I myself is extremely experienced with the mechanics of the game as many of the changes made to make Z508 so realistic was through my nagging of Zach to change or adjust something. ;))

[size=14pt][B]Benefits[/B][/SIZE]
This project has [B]massive potential[/B] with [B]revolutionary concepts[/B] and ideas still under development. I am hoping to create a server with a [B]fully functional website and forums[/B], [B]dedicated servers[/B], [B]server worlds[/B], and much more.
(Just naming [B]external[/B] features of the server. More [B]internal[/B] features above.)

Meaning this [B]will[/B] be a profitable project involving [B]real life currency[/B].

[size=14pt][B]Result[/B][/SIZE]
Completion of an unparallel, unmatched, extraordinary, revolutionary private server on the front page of all communities including RuneScape itself. Undeniable superiority, one-of-a-kind service and values inexplicable.

All because of you.


[I]Thanks,
I am looking forward to working with one of you soon! :)[/I]</description>

              <p>Hello Win, I don’t know if you have heard of me (as I only release my things on these forums), but I have heard of you on JH. This sounds like a great idea and I would be glad to help. I can provide you examples of my RSPS and general Java programming if you so desire, and I would be happy to make something from scratch if you want to test me. Even if you want to work with someone else, I wish you the best of luck.</p>

<p>also, good-luck with this, z508 was a true pioneer for its time, i loved the source, and the combat itself was flawless,</p>
