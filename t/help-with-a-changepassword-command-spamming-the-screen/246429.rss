    <title>Help with a ::changepassword command + spamming the screen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-a-changepassword-command-spamming-the-screen/246429</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I am in need of some help, yet again. :p

Well, I was trying to whip up a ::changepassword command, but I couldnt get it to function. My friend tried to help me as well, but to no avail.
Can anyone help me out with it?

Another thing, I wanted to make something appear in the chatbox, every lets say 30 seconds. How would I go about? 

Thanks for anyone who even reads. :)

EDIT ~~ A nooblike question, how do I change which way NPC&#39;s face?</description>
