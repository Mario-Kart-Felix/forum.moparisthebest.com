    <title>Laser possibly shooting through CD?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/laser-possibly-shooting-through-cd/492293</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

Recently, I was playing a game and I noticed that everything worked fine except for one thing. The cut scenes and things like that would take a long time to load. I also noticed that it sounded like the laser slider (thing that makes the laser move back and forward) sounded like it was working hard. So I opened the tray cover and saw a red dot (the laser) and I was wondering if that would effect it in anyway, and if so, how could I help prevent make it better (such as putting something over the cd like a sticker). Thanks!</description>

              <p>The film (aka data layer as rip4d mentioned) is <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> thin and will let a laser shine through. Don’t worry the data being read fine. The only thing keeping the laser from shooting through is the label on the CD. I have blank CD’s that I buy that you can almost see through. Its rather fuzzy, but you can make out shapes really well. The data layer is not a mirror, remember that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>It gives that effect like it is. It’s suppose to do that though, because I had problems with my cd drive for my xbox and I played around with it and got the game the play with the shell of the drive off and saw the laser while the game was playing.</p>
