    <title>Help with segmentation algorithms</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-segmentation-algorithms/391926</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for a competent java programmer to help me out, I&#39;m completely swamped with work and have no time, so am looking to lighten my load a bit. I need someone to code the following three algorithms. I will of course be needing the source code as I will be incorporating these into a larger program.

1) K-Means
2) Normalised cuts
3) EM algorithm

These will be used for image segmentation. Specifically what you need to do is read in an image, segment it using one of the above methods and create a new image which should be named depending on which method was used to create it. E.g input is P48.jpg, output would be P48K.jpg, P48N.jpg or P48E.jpg.

I will pay $50 via paypal for the first working implementation of each algorithm. To avoid any &#39;omg i sent you code and you didnt pay me scammer&#39; issues, I suggest you pm me asking if I still need it before you send me the code. Any questions etc, post here or pm me.

Oh, and a sample of the type of image these will be used on: http://imgur.com/qlyNw.jpg</description>
