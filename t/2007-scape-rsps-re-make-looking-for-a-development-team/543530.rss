What could you improve on the server: Stuff that people find boring (NPC Drops, Spawns, Dialogue, Animations, Special Weapons, Teleports, Commands and everything like that)<br>
About yourself: I am 18 years old who is currently in College. I love music Games and RSPS and always loved being in the RSPS scene. Been on Moparscape since Jan 2009 and made some good RSPS’s. I love doing the small boring stuff because it gives me something to do because no one wants to sort out the drops and Npc’s and everything like that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
