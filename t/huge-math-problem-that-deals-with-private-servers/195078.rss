    <title>Huge math problem that deals with private servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/huge-math-problem-that-deals-with-private-servers/195078</link>
    <description>Ok so I was working on combinations for a new thing I was going to make and now I understand I cant code of them because of how large the number of combinations would be...
So here is the math problem.

48!
And for all you retards that do not how to do this.
48! is basically just 48*47*46*45*44*43*42*41*40*39*38 all the way down to *1.
Does anyone know how to find this without getting a hella error?
Like an online calculator with the capacity of a 12gb screen or something lol...</description>

              <p>Create a calculator in java using a long. The long has a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, that should suffice? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
A calculator class might look something like…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.io.*;
public class calculator {
	public long totalResult;
	public int result;
	public void calculate(int a, int b, String operation) {
		if (operation.equals("addition")) {
			result = a + b;
		}
		if (operation.equals("subtraction")) {
			result = a - b;
		}
		if (operation.equals("division")) {
			result = a / b;
		}
		if (operation.equals("multiplication")) {
			result = a * b;
		}
	}
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		for (int i = 48; i = 1; i--) {
			calculate(i, i-1, "multiplication");
			totalResult += result;
		}
		System.out.println(totalResult);
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>In fact, that would work, lol.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow, I just tried that in my calculator and didn’t realise how big it is…a long can’t even handle it o.0</p>
