Quite Frankly, If you read your own post again you’ll see what I posted was valid. You said they were unfair. They weren’t unwarranted. Unwarranted= given without good reason. Use a dictionary before you flame me. Your were wrong as well. So you be the good little girl you were meant to me and stfu.</p>
