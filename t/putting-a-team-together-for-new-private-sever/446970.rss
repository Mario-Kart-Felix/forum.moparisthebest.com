    <description>Hello all (sorry if this is in the wrong section, im new) i am going to be starting up a runescape private server in the next following weeks, i am playing on going with a vps company to host it. i will be currently working on a website, features etc. so i am looking to put a team together, this team will consist of......

Coder (java of course)
GFX designer (for homepage design, webclient design, specific items etc.)
Co-Founder/Partner (to help me run things smoothly)
(if you come up with an idea of being something please message me and i will review and either accept of decline it)

if you think i am inexperienced about private servers, well i have ran a couple of servers about 1-2 years ago, 1 was successful but i didn&#39;t have the time to run it, or the money (i know have a very high paid job and can run a server easy) i did a bit of scripting for shops, banks and custom teleports (yes it is very basic) anyways if you are interested in any position above feel free to leave a post below, or message me (whatever is easiest for you) i dunno how many spots are for each position, i will work it out in the next day or two (or depends on how many people submit for a position) i havn&#39;t decided on a name yet (i have alot of other things to do and think about before i get to that)

also feel free to move this thread (if it&#39;s in the wrong section)</description>
