    <title>Mac or Pixelmator anyone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mac-or-pixelmator-anyone/330586</link>
    <description>Okay so I was planning to start Photoshopping again after a month long break because of school and stuff but since everything&#39;s settled, I had some time on my hands so why not Photoshop?

I came about this tutorial on Abduzeedo about the torch man &amp; I loved it.
Why? Well because it&#39;s really hard to make realistic fire effects with Photoshop and although he used Pixelmator, I heard that it was just the more Mac-compatible version of PS or well has a better display than PS.
Well, the stocks he provided are either paid or unavailable and I need them the most. 

So like I said, I heard P/mator is sortof like PS so I wondered if anyone with a Mac OS and Pixelmator could download [url=http://tutorials.pixelmator.com/fireman/Fireman.pxm]this[/url] and post its contents individually in .psd
Like the fireball, the man or you could just tell me the layers and I could tell you which ones I need.
I&#39;d really appreciate this.


EDIT: For the tut, go here - http://abduzeedo.com/torch-man-pixelmator</description>

I’ve seen that tutorial also, it’s taken from Abduzeedo.</p>
<p>I need someone who has Mac and Pixelmator, it’s a long shot but I’m pretty sure someone can do it here…</p>
<p>It’s been a long time, can someone seriously help out?</p>
