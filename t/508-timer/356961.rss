    <title>508 Timer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-timer/356961</link>
    <description>I am adding PvP Timer to my 508/525 Project. I been getting Pms in my Forums that Players are 
Running back into safe zone after special attacking with dragon claws. 
I want to put a stop to this. Im adding 10 Second Timer. Like if your attacked in Hotzone and player runs in safe zone, Opponent
will still be able to attack them until the 10 seconds is over.

I got the everything except, How to notify the server when the player is running into safe zone
from hotzone while being attacked.

Codes:
Player Attacked By:
[code]if (p.attackedBy != null)[/code]
Player Attacking:
[code]if (p.attacking == null)[/code]

Still needed:
-Code for telling server that Player is being attacked while he is coming into safe zone and still needs to be attacked until 10 seconds.
-Code for telling server player is or is not in HotZone.

Thanks.</description>
