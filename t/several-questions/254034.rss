    <description>Hello, I want to know how you can make rune essence work. I can&#39;t mine it and I want to code it to make it work. Also, I want to add the altars too. How can I do this?

I made a new source and there is duel in there on devo 7, how do I dupe again? Can you even dupe now?

How do you make it so that only mods + can noclip and setitem and if players do it it kicks them?</description>
