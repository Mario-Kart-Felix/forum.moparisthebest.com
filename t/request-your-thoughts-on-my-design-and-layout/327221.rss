    <title>[Request] Your thoughts on my design and layout</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-your-thoughts-on-my-design-and-layout/327221</link>
    <description>The last few months I have attempted to get somewhere with (X)HTML and CSS since I suck at it. So what I managed to come up with, is a basic layout and design that I have been considering porting to PHP (it is currently (X)HTML as it is a mockup).

What I would like is to hear your opinions about this layout and design. What would you change? What would you keep the same? If you would want to change anything, then if you could, please, let me know why - that would be awesome...

Also, you should just ignore what is actually written, because yes, it is Swedish, and no, what&#39;s written is so not important! When this site goes &quot;live&quot;, the main language on it will be English - and what&#39;s currently written will not even be translated; it will be removed.

To take into consideration, is that this design and layout has been hand-crafted (no tools used to generate the code) and supports the majority of browsers out there (yes, including IE6 and its broken DOM-structure). It should also validate (X)HTML and CSS correctly aswell as support the majority of the screen-resolutions out there.

The address is: www.macroing.org

Before you ask: No, this website is not about anything related to RuneScape. Why I called it Macroing.org (and Macroing.net) is another story...</description>

<p>curse you sir <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> thats an insult. I had some interest in rsps years ago, but for the past couple of years i’ve been more serious with programming. A great majority of Moparscapers can’t program even if their life depended on it. I’m currently doing coop for an anti spy/adware company … as ironic it may sound, my job is to write malicious code (still in my 2 months of training period though :P) planning to go into info security… if my code was messy, i’d get shot &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Anyways, by neat i meant how organized you were with your css and divs.   I am strict on good programming habits, except for when it comes to html.   even my PHP is somewhat neat <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> just the html i am not so passionate for.</p>

But then also, what’s written at the moment isn’t of high importance. I am going to switch to English when I have something actually worth showing.</p>

              <p>inertia: I cannot really find any good font (color, size, family etc) for that. And wouldn’t it look a little bit messy too?</p>
<p>Unhandled: I am not sure what you mean, but I hope my new update fixed it. If you were referring to the background image with a gradient, it would already be at the bottom of the site - and in my opinion, it would already be the footer (which means there would be nothing below it).</p>
<p>fellixombc: I hope I fixed what you and Unhandled both agreed on. And I also fixed the border. It is now gone. It did fit well in the beginning though. But as the design change, so does the layout.</p>
<p>lawl: Yep, I like simple too! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> However, what’d you suggest to decrease its boring-ness?</p>
<p>Everyone: I havn’t checked up whether it does work well on IE6 this time or not. So if anyone here uses IE6 and notice that, you don’t have to tell me about it. I will look that up myself when I get the time to do so.</p>

              <p>inertia: You’re very right about its state; it doesn’t look finished simply because it isn’t. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Why it isn’t finished, is because it’s a mockup. And a mockup usually tend to be a set of static webpages (which also explains why I didn’t write it in PHP directly) - showing their layout, design and flow (although I omitted their flow this time).</p>
<p>When it comes to actual content, I have planned to add a panel similar to the one containing the HTML-validation image, but instead containing components for logging in. And when you’re logged in, it should contain other panels with information about your account etc. Here the PHP comes in…</p>
<p>Another thought I had, was to add the option for a matching image to the left of the news-posts. It would indeed make it look less empty. And the third thought I had, was to perhaps change the default buttons with some other gradient image, as they look quite similar to the gradient image in the menu background.</p>
<p>Greeny: Yes, I thought the same at first. But, seeing as not everyone uses later versions than IE6 (I know, I didn’t not too long ago - and… Shame on me for that), it would be better to support it than not to. I mean, more people would be able to view my website without feeling forced to update their browser. Plus, it makes it seem more “professional” to me.</p>
