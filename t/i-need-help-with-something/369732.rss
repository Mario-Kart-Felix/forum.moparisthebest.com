    <description>Hi

Recently I downloaded a client, and I was able to play until my step mom got a stupid windows essentails virus onto the computer, I mangaged to remove the virus but everytime I try to load te server it says &quot;reqeusting title screen&quot; then moves on to say &quot;Connection error trying again in 5 seconds&quot; or something like that, It never loads, and anytime I try to use the webclient it will load but it will stop when it&#39;s almost done and never connect...:l can someone help me please?</description>
