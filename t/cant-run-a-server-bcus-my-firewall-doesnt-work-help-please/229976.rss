    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-run-a-server-bcus-my-firewall-doesnt-work-help-please/229976</link>
    <description>I had before a rs2 server.. but i now coded alot of new feathures on my source and want to run it back. But i have port forwarded, opened the classpath and path and got jdk and no-ip and all. But its not on. Than ppl should say. Open ur ffirewall.. but my firewall doesnt work, it doesnt open. So it can&#39;t block my port. So why it doesnt work. Or does anybody know how i can re-install my [WINDOWS] firewall again? (no, not another firewall)</description>
