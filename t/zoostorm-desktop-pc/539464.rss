<p>Then definitely don’t pick any AMD APU if you want a gaming PC. Go for a current gen i5 or i7, and spend the extra money on a dedicated GPU. If you don’t want to build your own check out iBuyPower’s website<br>
[/quote]call me an amdfagboy I don’t care, but AMD can compete when it comes to gaming and it costs less. “an i5 or i7”</p>
<p>The 8300 series is equivalent to an I7 and actually uses all eight cores ( so I have been told ) while intel only uses hyperthreading which supposedly is good as well ( again amd fan so can’t really state on that)</p>
<p>My system has an 8350 with a r9 290x in it and it can blow many intel builds out of the water. The cost of my system in reality is much much lower than the average intel at that.</p>
<p>Now, besides arguing “gaming specs” I will point out here having the best hardware doesn’t mean everything either. I.e. why have a gt 760 when you don’t really have a need for one? You can get by on max specs just fine with a gt 640 ddr5 or something of that rank and still play games such as BF4 on max specs 1920x1080</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> I will have to agree with T4 on this one. It is highly advised for you to build your own. There are literally hundreds of “how to build your own computer” guides out there on the internet. Keep in mind that the graphics card will be the most expensive item you purchase most likely ( depending on the card it could be the cpu I guess but you do want a good video card so you don’t have to buy one two years later I guess )</p>
<p>What I would suggest:</p>
<p>-AMD 8350 cpu<br>
-AMD RADEON 7850 (plenty of power even for BF4) gpu/video card<br>
-Some kind of an SSD (for your operating system you don’t need a majorly large one)<br>
-As games have gotten larger I would consider getting a 2TB-3TB hard drive. I only have a 1TB and I plan to add an additional drive as well later my own self as I see mine almost 85% full.<br>
-The case may look like crap, and with the intake fan holes on the case window it gets kind of loud however it has excellent ventilation from my own experience I would suggest getting a Solaris case by Azza.<br>
-You want to get good memory a lot of people will say that “memory is memory” however personally I disagree. I would look into getting some 1866 Corsair memory of some kind. I find that the alternative cheaper sticks tend to get damaged for whatever reason sooner… ( again personal preference on that one )<br>
-I would look into only buying a power supply that has a bronze certified or higher. This is so you know that the power supply won’t be complete crap. Similar to the memory, buy from a good brand such as Antec or Cooler Master for the psu.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>If you do not wish to purchase the parts/and build one your self. You can find some decently priced mid grade gaming machines on BestBuy website(U.S. and Canada only!). I would suggest looking at the IBUYPOWER name brand however please keep in mind that I would highly advise updating the psu immediately as normally retail computers will have the “bare minimum” psu and normally an off brand.</p>
<p>A great resource for building/finding parts easier ( doesn’t have ALL parts but a good many) is PCPartPicker.</p>
<p><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/%5B/quote%5DProcessor" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pcpartpicker.com/[/quote]Processor</a> core usage is application dependant, I doubt any game actually utilises eight cores (four should be more than enough). You generally wont need RAM faster than 1666MHz, just grab 8GBs of it. I recommend the <a href="http://www.fractal-design.com/home/product/cases/define-series/define-r4-black-pearl" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Fractal Design R4</a> case, it’s slick and quiet. You wont need much power, I have an i7-4770k and GTX770 and only use a 700W PSU (probably overkill).</p>
<p>OP post budget so we can actually help you make wise choices.</p>
