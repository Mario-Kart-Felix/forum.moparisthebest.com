    <description>The title says &quot;Everyone read&quot; Because i dont think i can explain it in 1 sentence. Sorry =X

Ok so me and my buddy have been coding a server and all (317). And hes going to buy the Vps tomorrow. (the 25th). After that we have a few things to finish up and were ready to release. But im like 99% sure that the client has alot of stuff that dosnt need to be in there. So im looking for someone who can look through the client files and delete the stuff we dont need (Folders, Interfaces, Models, Java and Class files). We arent offering a reward other then &#39;Mod&#39; cuz we dont think its that big of a deal. We just want it to seem very &#39;Profesional&#39; And small as possible, For faster download speed duh. Me and my friend are always in ventrilo and We both have Teamviewer so communication isnt a problem. 

If you think you can Clean up the Files a bit then Post here or add my Msn
Brandondiaz-@hotmail.com

Thanks for taking your time to read this and i hope someone can help me out. 
Also id like to wish Everyone reading this and the rest of the Moparscape community a good Holiday Experience. (Trying to be politicly correct. If you know what i mean.)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 25, 2009, 10:01:57 am[/size][hr]Bump?</description>
