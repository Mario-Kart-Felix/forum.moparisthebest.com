    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-getting-rsps-667-online/550187</link>
    <description>- I have port forwarded my router to 43594 and checked with canyouseeme.org and it says it&#39;s ok
- I have a no-ip which I put in client.java (in the client folder)
- i have a jar file which only works on the computer with the server folder, and not any other computer. (I already tried)

Why doesnt it work on the other computer? I tried theClient Jar file on computer 2 and it&#39;s stuck at 1%

Please Help with my server</description>
