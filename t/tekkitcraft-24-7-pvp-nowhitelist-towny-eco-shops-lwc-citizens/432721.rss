How To Install it
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7-Ul0VUwp4

Create you own nation of towns, be a king. Claim land, for you residents to be safe in. We at TekkitCraft belives that Tekkit should be in the survivalmode, where the fittest will survive! When you start off, you have nothing. You can eihter run into the wilderness and create you own town, or you can join a town that already exists. Its dangerouse in the wildnerness, you cant really feel safe there, but you will be ur own master, no one to share your items and creations with..

But if you join a town, you creations are safe from greifers, they just cant reach it. Have your personal plots, where not even the other residents of the town can enter, invite only your friends to it, or give everyone in that town access, you decide what you want to do. Just remember, a town is based on sharing and community, thats whats makes it so safe.

We got a real dedicated crew, to ensure that you will get the best experience with Tekkit that you possible can get, from people that never player Minecraft before, or if you have played since Alpha.

[size=7pt]Dont ask if you can donate, we dont run it that way, just play, use your RL money on something else[/size]
