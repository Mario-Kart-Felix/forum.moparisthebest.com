    <title>Server Isn&#39;t Working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-isnt-working/283067</link>
    <description>Ok, my friend had set-up everything, everything is checked and correct, but every time I try going on, it won&#39;t work, I portfowarded and did everything. Could someone give me some possibilities on what might be wrong. He&#39;s using Vista btw and I think you might have to do something for Vista users, but I&#39;m not completely sure, so could someone please help.</description>
