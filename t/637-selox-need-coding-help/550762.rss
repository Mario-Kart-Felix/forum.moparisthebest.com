    <title>637 Selox Need coding help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/637-selox-need-coding-help/550762</link>
    <description>Hi I was working on a 317 server which I would like some help with that too, getting claws to work and getting hp above health bars and a few other questions, I then found this source and client. It has everything I need but im having trouble changing commands and other functions
The servers name is Selox but I cant seem to change the message or adjust the commands I have a few ideas though about to continue trying

I would really appreciate some help I want to make a server better than soulsplit and would like multiple owners. I like how they set up three different options if interested in helping me we could work together and each have our own world, if your not interested but do have some helpful info on selox I would be very greatful, thanks for reading
