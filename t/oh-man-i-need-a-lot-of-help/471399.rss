    <description>I have been gone for a long time and when I was here 317 were the shit. Now I see all of these 600+ servers. I want to start another server for fun, I&#39;ve never really had one that I would call successful. Is there anything I should know? I&#39;m not asking to be spoon-fed, I&#39;m searching around looking and all of the new things, but I just need some help. If anyone would like to tell me anything about the new servers that would be useful I would greatly appreciate it. Are they a lot different from the old servers? More files? Etc...</description>
