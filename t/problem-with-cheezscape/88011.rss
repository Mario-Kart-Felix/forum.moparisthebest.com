    <title>Problem with Cheezscape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-cheezscape/88011</link>
    <description>I am using Cheezscape Update 80.
I have found that I cannot sell anything to the general stores.
I know that in shops.cfg it should have Buy 1 Sell 1, Which is there.

I changed it to Buy 2 Sell 2, Nothing, I can&#39;t even sell items that I buy off the shop back to it.
So i changed it back and still nothing.

A little help please... Thanks.</description>

Perhaps just go back to what you added and make sure it doesn’t conflict with something else, that usualy ends up being the problem when you follow so many different tutorials.</p>
