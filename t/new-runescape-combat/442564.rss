    <description>http://services.runescape.com/m=news/the-evolution-of-combat-beta-sign-up
Will this be a success or failure for Jagex? I think this is going to ruin rs even more..

If I get in, I want to keep the client to be able to emulate from, but I want to make sure I get as much mapdata as possible. afaik you would have to send the construct mapdata packet, <span class="bbcode-b">but since the client is heavily obfuscated I highly doubt I could find the packet before beta is over</span> (If i’m incorrect, I’m sorry.

<p>If they add in an action bar i’ll be quite down… The new combat system as in bleed outs etc is quite cool but I don’t see how they are going to make all the existing equipment work with the new updates. So many armours don’t even have absorbs yet and thats been out for a while.<br>
It is clear they are trying to attract a new player base, rs will either die or become huge in my opinion.<br>

why do they keep making these stupid changes to make it less like the real runescape i <span class="bbcode-b">used</span> to know?  their making tons of money, why change anything at all<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Although somewhat exaggerated, that’s an excellent question imo. Obviously, any of us can only speculate, but this is essentially what I’ve been assuming lately: Jagex lost such a significant portion of their user base after the bot nuke (and will continue to lose them) that they essentially need to keep updating their game to keep old players wanting to play and maybe acquire a new group of RuneScapers in the process. Given that the reasons for botting have been due to the actual mechanics of the game, they have had to make drastic changes to try and target botting at its roots. These have obviously led to some significant changes to the game, which veterans simply hate. Well, that covers combat and skill rebalancing, but not the new armor updates. As far as that goes, I believe Jagex has made the choice of trying to create a new user base instead of trying to save the old one. This allows them to use almost “start fresh” with members. If these members have never had the idea of botting in their minds, they never will because the game will never need them to.</p>
<p>That’s sort of my thought process, anyway. I could go into more bullshit speculation about their financial difficulties as well, but who the hell knows what’s going on there.[/quote]<br>

<p>Although somewhat exaggerated, that’s an excellent question imo. Obviously, any of us can only speculate, but this is essentially what I’ve been assuming lately: Jagex lost such a significant portion of their user base after the bot nuke (and will continue to lose them) that they essentially need to keep updating their game to keep old players wanting to play and maybe acquire a new group of RuneScapers in the process. Given that the reasons for botting have been due to the actual mechanics of the game, they have had to make drastic changes to try and target botting at its roots. These have obviously led to some significant changes to the game, which veterans simply hate. Well, that covers combat and skill rebalancing, but not the new armor updates. As far as that goes, I believe Jagex has made the choice of trying to create a new user base instead of trying to save the old one. This allows them to use almost “start fresh” with members. If these members have never had the idea of botting in their minds, they never will because the game will never need them to.</p>
<p>That’s sort of my thought process, anyway. I could go into more bullshit speculation about their financial difficulties as well, but who the hell knows what’s going on there.[/quote]<br>
I think you’re right about the creating a new user base; that’s what it really looks like now.</p>

              <p>Read through all 6 pages of this, and saw that nobody supported the update, other than Davidi2 and some other guy, yet they’ve seen 1 screenshot of what it MIGHT turn out to be like.<br>
While I’m sitting here in reality and notice that we only have 1 screenshot and maybe a :30 video leak of what it might look like. I guarantee that half of you haven’t even seen a picture of it, you just see that Jagex is trying to improve their game with some updates and immediately troll them.</p>
<p>The combat MIGHT not be too bad, I’m almost positive it will make bossing 100000x more fun.</p>
