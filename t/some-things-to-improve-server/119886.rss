    <title>Some things to improve server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-things-to-improve-server/119886</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking around for some things to help with my server, such as anti-cheat,, something to stop massers like instant ip ban if you click alot, and if you try to use ::noclip or ::lag = instant ban. Could anyone help me out here?

EDIT: I was looking at the sticky under Sever and Source protection, but I don&#39;t know which one&#39;s best or which is absolutely neccesary.(sp?), so if you could inform me on that also, that would be great ^.^ Thanks in advance.</description>
