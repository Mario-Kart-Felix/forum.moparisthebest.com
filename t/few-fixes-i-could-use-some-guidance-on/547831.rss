    <title>Few fixes i could use some guidance on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-fixes-i-could-use-some-guidance-on/547831</link>
    <description>For the record I&#39;m using mezzyscape.
[s]1: how can I edit items i.g; holy book, unholy book etc.
to not require quests to use. (what file am I editing? Is it server or client side?)[/s]
Fixed this one with mezzy&#39;s help.
2: prayers do nothing (well the icon shows up but they don&#39;t block)
How can I edit this?
[s]3: players can&#39;t trade without doing the first quest, (First quest won&#39;t finish, how can i remove this?)
[/s]
Got this one as well.

I have other questions; but this is the most important for now.
its just a private server, with a few friends.</description>
