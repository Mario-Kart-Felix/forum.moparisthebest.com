    <title>I need some help on this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-some-help-on-this/67506</link>
    <description>This morning I sat down at my computer chair and turned on my laptop, I go to moparisthebest.com/smf/ and all that and it says an error has occured. It says I was banned and the next time I get a complaint it will be permanent. Im just trying to get on there to ask a question about, why my Hamachi is not loading up... It says there are to many other people trying to connect and I cant get on at this time.

If someone could help me with the question of why I was banned (I took that quiz.. I havent posted for awhile to, maybe besides my brother posting...) I asked my brother and he said he did not post anything.
So right now im really confused and I just need ALOT!! Of help.  :mad:

By the way, I know this does not belong in this forums, its just that this is the only forums i can get on to.[br][size=1]Posted on: March 13, 2007, 11:43:26 AM[/size][hr]Cant someone help me?  :confused:</description>

              <p>I don’t know anything about your ban, but here’s the answer to your question:</p>
<p>Your link to whatever network isn’t working because there are to many other people trying to connect and you can’t get on at that time. It’s because everyone’s running free Hamachi networks - the maximum capacity is 16 (vs. 256 for premium).</p>

              <p>Well ive been banned from here before when it was an actual mistake… had no idea why, had pwnd on msn and asked him what happened and he said it must have been a mistake and all was happy as he unbanned me.</p>
<p>But if your brother goes on your account than that is against the rules, although its not written in the rules you shouldnt let anyone but youself on the account.</p>
