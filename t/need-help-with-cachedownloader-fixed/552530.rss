              <p>Can you stop posting threads giving minuscule information then telling us to add you on skype?<br>
The idea of these forums is to get help <span class="bbcode-u">on the forums</span> so others that come across similar issues have more resources to fix it.<br>
Imagine if every tutorial in the tutorial section was like "This tutorial features X, Y, Z. To add it to your server, add me on skype My_super_cool_skype_username"<br>
Yeah… No one would want that.</p>
<p>So if you could explain what you’re stuck on, or provide some pictures of the issue, that would be helpful.<br>
It would be extra helpful if you also provide code related to the issue.</p>
