    <title>UV Mapping multiple materials in Cinema 4D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/uv-mapping-multiple-materials-in-cinema-4d/518413</link>
    <description>Alright so the dealio is that I have a 3D model of a tardis and the materials are broken into different parts of the model and I want to some how merge them all into one UV Map so that I can export it and import it into After Effects: Element 3D. The importing I can do obv and the UV Mapping I have attempted but in Cinema 4D but I cannot seem to merge all of the materials and flatten them so it can become a full UV Map of the tardis, I have followed many tutorials and none of them seemed to help. Any ideas? @frell</description>
