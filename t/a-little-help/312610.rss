    <description>well ok i have 2 small problems that no matter how many times i recode them they wont fix themselves and its a little strange cause idk why i tryed the same way i did on my server on my friends source and it worked perfectly.

im using mezzyscape source

well ok the npc drops fine but if someone teles in when ur fighting the drop wont show up for u but will them i need a good way to make it so drops work for the person who did the most dmg.

also idk why but my pking ares wont drop the person items as the loot when someone dies


and if anyone has any good npc attack codes for like gwds that would be nice</description>
