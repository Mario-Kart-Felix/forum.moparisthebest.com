    <title>A little help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-little-help/490116</link>
    <description>Alright i am the co-owner at a rsps me and a friend run called trip-pk. the past week ive done all the coding which is fine because i needed to learn [pi] so i would say i have a decent amount of knowledge towards [pi] well i have an idea but im not sure how i would get this to work properly.

- Minigame -
Angels &amp; Demons
Description - 2 teams of 2 players or more will spawn with demon wings and angel wings &quot; which i already have coded &quot; And must battle the temple guardians &quot; A very powerful and wise old dragon ( which ive already coded )  &quot; In order to eliminate the other team. basically like soul wars. but the problem im having is when i created a similar project , i used pk points and shops. but the shops could be baught from with gold even though you needed pk points. 

So my question.

Can someone help me get the correct codes for this.
Every kill earned in Angels &amp; demons will reward the player with 3 A&amp;D points.
Once all players are eliminated the last ones standing will receive 10 bonus A&amp;D points.
Then there will be a shop which good items can be bought from using A&amp;D points.
When your inside the A&amp;D mini-game an indicator will say in the bottom right corner &amp; Angels and demons Minigame
Last thing , Specific items will be assigned in the mini-game ,  and nothing else can be equipped inside.

I thought about using Funpk to get my codes , but its messy and hard to edit , i prefer clean codes , but at this point im desperate and will use any code that works.
I know how to add shops , Add borders to in game areas. and alot more.. etc etc..</description>
