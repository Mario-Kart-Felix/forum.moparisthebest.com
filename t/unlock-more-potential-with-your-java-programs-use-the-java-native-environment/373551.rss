    <description>[center][size=18pt][b]Using the Java Native Environment[/b][/size][/center] 
This tutorial will teach you the basics of using the Java Native Interface (JNI), coupled with C++, to do a lot more with your programs. This will not be an explanation of the JNI and what it is; if you want that, click [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JNI]here[/url] This will be the &#39;dummies&#39; guide, for people that have never used C++, and I will include pictures of what you will be doing in the IDE.

Before I get started, I&#39;d like to thank abraham2119 for encouraging me to learn about using the JNI.

[anchor=neededitems][u][b]Needed items[/b][/u]

[ul][li]A C++ IDE (Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 is what I will be using in this example)[/li]
[li]Java Development Kit[/li][/ul]

Once you have those things, we can get started.

[anchor=javacode][u][b]Writing the Java Code[/b][/u]
The first thing you do when using the JNI is make a normal Java class. This class will be the one that loads the [b]Dynamic-link library[/b] (DLL), which you will be making later. Here is the example class we will be using in this tutorial, it is important to read the comments:
[code=java]/**
 *
 * @author David
*/

public class Tutorial {

  static {
    System.loadLibrary(&quot;TutorialDLL&quot;); //Load the library we will be creating in C++
  }

  public native void nativeVoidInitialize(); // Native methods are methods that are handled in the C++ code library. 
  public native void helloWorld(); //They can still be called in the Java program, as you will see below, but the library will handle them
  
  void noParameters() { //These next three methods look like normal methods, and that&#39;s because they are.
    System.out.println(&quot;No parameters :)&quot;);
  }

  void getNativeParameters(int i) { //They can be called in the normal Java program, but they are also loaded into the JNI and can be called via the library
    System.out.println(&quot;Integer: &quot; + i);
  }

  void getTwoNativeParameters(int i, boolean b) { //There is a special way to load method ID&#39;s into the C++ code, which I will show you how to do
    if(b) {
      System.out.println(&quot;Boolean true, integer &quot; + i);
    } else {
      System.out.println(&quot;Boolean false, integer &quot; + i);
    }
  }
  
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Tutorial tut = new Tutorial(); //Makes an instance of this Tutorial class
    tut.nativeVoidInitialize(); //These are the native methods that will be handled by the C++ code, look up to see how they are declared
    tut.helloWorld(); //You can have as many native methods as you like!
    tut.noParameters(); //This is just showing that you can call these methods from inside the Java code, and in the C++ code (later)
  }
 [/code]

That&#39;s it! That&#39;s all the Java code you will be writing for this example.

[anchor=makingheader][u][b]Making the C++ Header File[/b][/u]
Now that we have that, we need to make a [i]header[/i] file. Header files are used to declare things for other C++ files to use. You can read more about them [url=http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/19-header-files/]here[/url].
The great thing about these header files is, you don&#39;t need to write them! In fact, they are generated for you using a simple batch script, and editing them is not suggested. Here&#39;s the batch script (make sure that the .bat is in the same place as your .java file)[code]@echo off
echo JNI Tutorial - Compile and Create Header File - By Davidi2
title Compiling...
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin\javac.exe&quot; Tutorial.java
echo Compiled!
title Creating header file...
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin\javah.exe&quot; -jni Tutorial
echo Tutorial.h header file created!
pause[/code]
This will create the Tutorial header file in the same folder as your other files. Do not open it yet, just leave it alone.

[anchor=startingcppide][u][b]Starting the Microsoft Visual C++ IDE and making a DLL project[/b][/u]
Start MSVC++ if you haven&#39;t already. I will be using MVC++ [i]2010[/i], so depending on your IDE the steps might be different.
Once it&#39;s loaded, follow these steps to create the C++ project:
[img]http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/7435/tutorial1h.png[/img]

When the new project dialog shows, follow these steps:
[img]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/4674/tutorial2y.png[/img]

When the application wizard pops up, follow these steps:
[img]http://img204.imageshack.us/img204/9016/tutorial3k.png[/img]

Project made!

[anchor=impheader][u][b]Importing our Tutorial header[/b][/u]
Here comes the fun part. If you&#39;re using VS2010, like me, it will automatically create and open TutorialDLL.cpp (the cpp extension stands for C++) On the left, it [i]should[/i] have opened the Solution Explorer, which you can use to open other files that are part of the project. If it did not open for some reason, you can type in the shortcut [i]Ctrl+Alt+L[/i].
Now we need to import the header we made with that batch script! To get that started, follow these steps:
[img]http://img842.imageshack.us/img842/1472/tutorial4.png[/img]

A dialog will pop up:
[img]http://img89.imageshack.us/img89/6438/tutorial5.png[/img]
(It says Tutorial, not Tutoriall; it was the cursor)

Now, a blank Tutorial.h code page should pop up. Now, minimize VC++, and navigate to the folder you have your java files in, as well as the batch file and generated header file. Right click and open Header.h [b]in notepad[/b]. Copy all of the code in there, and paste it in the empty Header.h we made in VC++. It should now look like this:
[img]http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/7762/tutorial6.png[/img]

Now we need to fix that error. To do this, we are going to import the JNI include files. This step is tricky if you dont pay attention to the pictures. If you have problems, just comment.
[anchor=properties]
First, open the project properties.
[img]http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/1606/tutorial7.png[/img]

Then
[img]http://img403.imageshack.us/img403/3665/tutorial8.png[/img]

Then the hard(er) part
[img]http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/1736/tutorial9n.png[/img]

If you imported those 2 folders (include, and include\win32) correctly, the error(s) in Header.h should be gone.

[anchor=finally][u][b]Writing the C++ code[/b][/u]
Phew! That was a lot of work, and we didn&#39;t even start writing the code yet! Don&#39;t worry, it gets a little more fun now.

If you looked at TutorialDLL.cpp, you saw that it already had an import (&quot;stdafx.h&quot;) Right below that line, add 
[code=cpp]#include &quot;Tutorial.h&quot;[/code]This line is very important. Not only is it our declarations for our Java methods, it also contains the JNI include line.

So now we can get started! Open up your Tutorial.java again. See the native voids? These are the methods that we need to cover. The way we write a Java method (for JNI) is like this:
JNIEXPORT [b]type[/b] JNICALL Java_[b]ClassName[/b]_[b]MethodName[/b](JNIEnv *env, jobject obj) { }
The bolded things are the ones we change, the normal ones we leave alone.

  [b]Type[/b] - The type of method it is. void, String, integer etc
  [b]ClassName[/b] -&gt; [b]Method name[/b] - Self-explanatory, they are the class names and method names
JNIEnv and jobject you don&#39;t need to worry about at the moment. 
So here&#39;s how we would write the method for &quot;public native void nativeVoidInitialize();&quot;
[code=cpp]JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_Tutorial_nativeVoidInitialize(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj) { }[/code]

It&#39;s that easy! So now, every time you call nativeVoidInitialize in your Java program, it will be handled here! This mean that you can do C++ things, from a Java program. Feel free to experiment around with this, but I&#39;m going to continue the tutorial.

If you look back in your Java file, you see the normal methods, like getNativeParameters. The way you call these is not the same (because they are not native) In order to call a normal method, you need to have a JNI Environment, which you saw in JNIEnv *env.

Let&#39;s use this to our advantage.

[code=cpp]JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_Tutorial_nativeVoidInitialize(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj) {
	jclass tutorial = env-&gt;FindClass(&quot;Tutorial&quot;); //Get the JNI class instance
	jmethodID gnp = env-&gt;GetMethodID(tutorial, &quot;getNativeParameters&quot;, &quot;(I)V&quot;); //Finds the Tutorial method &#39;getNativeParameters&#39;.
	env-&gt;CallVoidMethod(obj, gnp, 6); //This calls the method that we found in the previos line. All of the parts after the method ID are the methods parameters
	jmethodID gtnp = env-&gt;GetMethodID(tutorial, &quot;getTwoNativeParameters&quot;, &quot;(IZ)V&quot;); //Finds the Tutorial method &#39;getTwoNativeParameters&#39;.
	env-&gt;CallVoidMethod(obj, gtnp, 10, false); //This calls the method that we found in the previos line. All of the parts after the method ID are the methods parameters
}[/code]You can get the gist of what each line does from the comments, but if you don&#39;t know C++, don&#39;t worry about it too much. Just try to memorize how to use the JNI specific methods.
Even still, I will go a little more in depth into GetMethodID, because it is important. 

GetMethodID(jclass, methodName, methodTypeAndParams);
The first two are self-explanatory, but the second one, not so much. The method type goes like so:
[i]&quot;(Paramtypes)Methodtype&quot;[/i]
for example, (IZ)V indicates a void, with the params int, and then boolean. 
Here is a table of the basic representations:
Z	boolean
B	byte
C	char
S	short
I	int
J	long
F	float
D	double
So let&#39;s summarize what the code does so far. We run Tutorial.java, which will call the native method nVI. This points to the DLL, which executes the code above. The code above gets an instance of the Tutorial class, then gets the method ID&#39;s for two different methods, and executes them with the parameters.

Here&#39;s the entire cpp code:
[code=cpp]// TutorialDLL.cpp : Defines the exported functions for the DLL application.
//

#include &quot;stdafx.h&quot;
#include &quot;Tutorial.h&quot;


JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_Tutorial_nativeVoidInitialize(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj) {
	jclass tutorial = env-&gt;FindClass(&quot;Tutorial&quot;); //Get the JNI class instance
	jmethodID gnp = env-&gt;GetMethodID(tutorial, &quot;getNativeParameters&quot;, &quot;(I)V&quot;); //Finds the Tutorial method &#39;getNativeParameters&#39;.
	env-&gt;CallVoidMethod(obj, gnp, 6); //This calls the method that we found in the previous line. All of the parts after the method ID are the methods parameters
	jmethodID gtnp = env-&gt;GetMethodID(tutorial, &quot;getTwoNativeParameters&quot;, &quot;(IZ)V&quot;); //Finds the Tutorial method &#39;getTwoNativeParameters&#39;.
	env-&gt;CallVoidMethod(obj, gtnp, 10, false); //This calls the method that we found in the previous line. All of the parts after the method ID are the methods parameters
	jmethodID np = env-&gt;GetMethodID(tutorial, &quot;noParameters&quot;, &quot;()V&quot;); //Finds the Tutorial method &#39;noParameters&#39;.
	env-&gt;CallVoidMethod(obj, np); //This calls the method that we found in the previous line. All of the parts after the method ID are the methods parameters (none, in this case)
}

JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_Tutorial_helloWorld(JNIEnv *env, jobject obj) { //Handles the native method helloWorld
	printf(&quot;Hello World!\n&quot;); //Equiv to System.out.print();
}
[/code]

Now, we get to make our DLL! In the middle of the top toolbar, there is a green arrow. Next to it is a box that says &#39;Debug&#39; Click the down arrow next to this box and change it to &#39;release&#39;. When you do this, you may get errors again. This is because it changed your project properties. If it happens, go back and do [iurl=#properties]this step[/iurl] again.

Once you&#39;re error-free, click the green arrow to create the DLL.
The output should be something like this:
[code]------ Build started: Project: TutorialDLL, Configuration: Release Win32 ------
  stdafx.cpp
  dllmain.cpp
  TutorialDLL.cpp
     Creating library c:\users\david\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\TutorialDLL\Release\TutorialDLL.lib and object c:\users\david\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\TutorialDLL\Release\TutorialDLL.exp
  Generating code
  Finished generating code
  TutorialDLL.vcxproj -&gt; c:\users\david\documents\visual studio 2010\Projects\TutorialDLL\Release\TutorialDLL.dll
========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========[/code]
Now, navigate to that project Foler\Release, and copy the TutorialDLL.dll
Paste the DLL in your Java project folder (where your Java files are)

Execute your Java file (batch), and it should work!

Now, by editing what the C++ methods do, you can have Java programs that do C++ things. For example, setting hooks, or drawing directly onto the screen.

If you want me to go more in-depth on a part, just post with what you need.</description>

</aside>
<p>Quite funny, considering runescape uses the JNI quite a bit. Also, it’s not as slow as you make it out to be. It <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> be faster than pure java, but this obviously depends on what you are doing.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/moparisthebest">@Moparisthebest</a> The JNI is useful mainly because of it being able to access OS-specific code, so don’t give us that portability bullshit.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The RuneScape client is also redundant in functionality. The portions of their native code to handle interfacing with OpenGL and DirectX aren’t needed, since they have their own 3D software renderer. Their 3D software renderer in native code is redundantly backed up with their pure-java software renderer. Thus, you can still run the RS client on any platform, just not 100% effectively on every platform.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages of using JNI, and sometimes it’s even necessary. I agree with the idea you should only use it if you absolutely need to, and if you only use it correctly. It’s pretty much pointless to write 95% of an application in Java, and the remaining 5% in C++ with OS dependencies that completely contradict the platform independent nature of the other 95% of the program. If you are going to make it platform dependent, why chose Java?

I wouldn’t say it’s redundant functionality. Some of the stuff that can be done using OpenGL/DirectX are not feasible in software rendering, given real-time constraints.</p>
<p>P.S. What I said to Moparisthebest was aimed at what he first said. I tl;dr’d the rest.</p>

You forgot to mention that this is ridiculously slow and is a pain in the ass manage. You posted a rather trivial example, but to be honest there aren’t many real applications using jni and most of them are probably better of done in raw java.</p>

Quite funny, considering runescape uses the JNI quite a bit. Also, it’s not as slow as you make it out to be. It <span class="bbcode-i">can</span> be faster than pure java, but this obviously depends on what you are doing.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/moparisthebest">@Moparisthebest</a> The JNI is useful mainly because of it being able to access OS-specific code, so don’t give us that portability bullshit.[/quote]</p>
<p>The RuneScape client is also redundant in functionality. The portions of their native code to handle interfacing with OpenGL and DirectX aren’t needed, since they have their own 3D software renderer. Their 3D software renderer in native code is redundantly backed up with their pure-java software renderer. Thus, you can still run the RS client on any platform, just not 100% effectively on every platform.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages of using JNI, and sometimes it’s even necessary. I agree with the idea you should only use it if you absolutely need to, and if you only use it correctly. It’s pretty much pointless to write 95% of an application in Java, and the remaining 5% in C++ with OS dependencies that completely contradict the platform independent nature of the other 95% of the program. If you are going to make it platform dependent, why chose Java? There are generally better choices for applications only written in Windows, Mac, or other systems, if you are writing solely for that system.</p>

I have no interest in C for the time being, but nevertheless, good job putting this out there. How long did your topic take to write? Mine took me 4 hours lol.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>He isn’t talking about C?[/quote]<br>
Actually JNI works for C or C++, or really any other native language if you want.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is more to it than this if you want a platform independent program, your native code has to be platform independent too, and you have to compile it for all targets, which is 64-bit windows, 32-bit windows, 32-bit Linux, 64-bit Linux, 64-bit OSX, PPC OSX, and possibly more I am forgetting.  It’s a huge pain in the ass.</p>
