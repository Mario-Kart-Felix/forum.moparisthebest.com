    <title>Is this anxiety?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-anxiety/313011</link>
    <description>Alright so I was doing some research into anxiety and all examples I found of it harming people was that it stopped them going to social events or made them self conscious, take drugs, drink or eat too much. But I have these small anxiety periods a while after an event. So say I went to a party, I&#39;m fine not anxious at all but then the day after, at home, alone I get really powerful waves of anxiety while thinking about what happened. Now surely this is the reverse of anticipation anxiety, I was just wondering what the reverse actually was.</description>
