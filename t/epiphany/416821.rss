    <title>Epiphany</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/epiphany/416821</link>
    <description>So I like just had an epiphany. 

We always talk about how RuneScape is so horrible now, and it was so fun back in 2004-2007. I agree, some things could&#39;ve been done better, and some updates shouldn&#39;t be added, but I think the main reason we miss the old game is because that was when we enjoyed playing it. What I mean by that is, [b]WE ALL GREW UP.[/b] We outgrew RuneScape, and we say that we miss the 2004-2007 era because that&#39;s when we enjoyed the game. Maybe that&#39;s just my opinion, what do you guys think?</description>

<hr>
<p>On topic: I somewhat agree with you. As a player from 2005 I thought clan wars was awesome. Then fist of guthix arrived I fell in love with that. My account got hacked for a short period of time. I got it back and found nothing on it(of course…) I came back a while later I just saw that  RuneScape over time evolved again. I dont think it is as much as we outgrew it, but we just didn’t evolve with the times.</p>

Just put membership on it, it’ll have between -30 and -180 days. Just purchase that much.</p>

<p>I don’t remember as many snobby arrogant assholes. Begging and scammed still existed (100k vs 1004 gp), but there wasn’t as many rude people. Botting was less common as well.[/quote]</p>
<p>I remember working my ass off to get a rune plate, bought it then some guy offered me 120k for it. I was spam clicking accept and he kept putting items up then taking them away and I was like WTF hurry up spamming clicking on the accept button and without realizing, he changed 120k to 12k I didn’t notice I’d been scammed till I accepted the trade. I was so mad lulz.</p>

              <p>People were less of dicks then. I feel like I can barely talk to anyone without them asking to see my “cash stack” or what my stats are. The game is to easy interface nowadays and to easy to join. Leveling up is significantly faster, and the economy is driving itself into the ground from bots.</p>
<p>It’s all snot nosed arrogant kids nowadays who spend to much time either playing or botting just to brag. What people don’t realize is that it’s just a game and that by botting you’re not actually doing what the game was made for, which is to kill time and have fun.</p>

              <p>So I like just had an epiphany.</p>
<p>We always talk about how RuneScape is so horrible now, and it was so fun back in 2004-2007. I agree, some things could’ve been done better, and some updates shouldn’t be added, but I think the main reason we miss the old game is because that was when we enjoyed playing it. What I mean by that is, <span class="bbcode-b">WE ALL GREW UP.</span> We outgrew RuneScape, and we say that we miss the 2004-2007 era because that’s when we enjoyed the game. Maybe that’s just my opinion, what do you guys think?</p>
