    <title>[PI]Adding a simple timer to a command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-a-simple-timer-to-a-command/370831</link>
    <description>This is just a very simple tutorial on how to add a timer to a command, so a player can only use each command once every X Milliseconds.


First, for the command,

[code=Java]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;command&quot;)) {
				if (System.currentTimeMillis() - c.lastCommand &gt; 30000) { //If the lastCommand timer is greater than 30,000 milliseconds (30 Seconds)
					c.lastCommand = System.currentTimeMillis(); //Resets the lastCommand timer
            		c.sendMessage(&quot;You may use this command once every 30 seconds.&quot;); //Sends a message
							
						} else { //If the lastCommand timer is not greater than 30,000 Milliseconds
            		c.sendMessage(&quot;Sorry, But you must wait 30 seconds before using this command again!&quot;);//Sends a message
				}
			}[/code]

Next in Player.java
Find 
[code=Java]public long lastPlayerMove[/code]
And add the name of your timer, in this case it would be lastCommand
so we would change the end of this integer from
[code=Java], foodDelay, potDelay;[/code]
To
[code=Java], foodDelay, potDelay, lastCommand;[/code]
Or we can add it in between
[code=Java], foodDelay, lastCommand, potDelay;[/code]
Where you add it doesn&#39;t matter, Just make sure that at the end of the integer there is a ;

This is a very simple tutorial but I couldn&#39;t find any other tutorials on how to do this and I figured it out by taking an already made command and playing around with it a bit.

This can be useful for limiting commands, in particular the &quot;yell&quot; command which is often abused.

And no, I don&#39;t make tutorials so please don&#39;t flame if it&#39;s not good, But i do like constructive criticism, as long as it&#39;s not flame.</description>

And this wouldn’t work 100%, you could simply relog and are able to perform the selected command.</p>
