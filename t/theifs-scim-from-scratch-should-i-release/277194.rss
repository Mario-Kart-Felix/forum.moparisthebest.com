              <p>You only manually animate in MQO when there is not a setting for the item in datmaker. E.g Platebodies, Body items, leg items and capes (u can use amulet anim for capes) Otherwise there is presets for them. E.g Right hand (weapons) Left hand (Sheilds) Head object (Helms etc) THe reason there can be presets is the priorites for these are basically the same for each item. Whereas with platebodies and legs because of the varying shapes etc You have to set certain priorites. Priorites are actually to do with emotes and how the armor moves with your body they shouldnt have any effect on making the item see through (only guessing on the though)</p>
