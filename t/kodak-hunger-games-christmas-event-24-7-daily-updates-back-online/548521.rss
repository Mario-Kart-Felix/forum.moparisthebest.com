[size=18pt]CHRISTMAS EVENT IS HERE! :p[/size]

Hello! If this is your first time here then I welcome you to our server advertisement!


Have you grown tired of most private servers, are you bored of doing the EXACT same thing on each and every one? Well, that&#39;s where we promise to be different at. Our server is entirely a mini-game based server, no leveling, and no grinding for hours on end to achieve goals that you might just end up losing anyways!

Sound good? Well continue reading! Our gameplay concept is based off the Hunger Games, similar to the Minecraft servers, but unique and fun in its own way! - If you don&#39;t know what the Hunger Games are, then you should definitely go watch the movie or read the book, you&#39;ll love them!

SO, do you think you can fight off 15 or more players in a timed death match? Oh not to mention, the only items you can acquire are the ones that you find around the map, or from the players you&#39;ve killed. AND did I mention the terrifying monsters roaming around?
Think you have what it takes? Only the best can win!

You can unlock or buy special kits to help your chances of winning, unlock new perks that increase passive abilities, and fight your way to the top! If you think you have what it takes, then please join, and be prepared to fight for your life!

<p>[size=18pt]CHRISTMAS EVENT IS HERE! :p[/size]</p>
<p>Hello! If this is your first time here then I welcome you to our server advertisement!</p>
<p>Have you grown tired of most private servers, are you bored of doing the EXACT same thing on each and every one? Well, that’s where we promise to be different at. Our server is entirely a mini-game based server, no leveling, and no grinding for hours on end to achieve goals that you might just end up losing anyways!</p>
<p>Sound good? Well continue reading! Our gameplay concept is based off the Hunger Games, similar to the Minecraft servers, but unique and fun in its own way! - If you don’t know what the Hunger Games are, then you should definitely go watch the movie or read the book, you’ll love them!</p>
<p>SO, do you think you can fight off 15 or more players in a timed death match? Oh not to mention, the only items you can acquire are the ones that you find around the map, or from the players you’ve killed. AND did I mention the terrifying monsters roaming around?<br>
Think you have what it takes? Only the best can win!</p>
<p>You can unlock or buy special kits to help your chances of winning, unlock new perks that increase passive abilities, and fight your way to the top! If you think you have what it takes, then please join, and be prepared to fight for your life!</p>
