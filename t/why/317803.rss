              <p>Taharok deserves all the awards he has been given, for many reasons. Do not think that he does not deserve them as he has helped this community in many ways than imaginable. He received his Java Cup as he has proved his Java knowledge on Moparisthebest countless times, and he has created framework which I have half-witnessed before, and there are many deeds he has done to deserve this cup. He deserves his Batman cup as he has helped many people on these forums as well as helped the entire website over the years. What you’ve just stated is ignorant and self-centered in my opinion.</p>
<p>I won’t ramble on, and we all know where this thread is headed if it remains open, so Newty closed it before me. ;\</p>

<p>I think Taharok deserves his batman cup, but I dont think he should get it. It has forever been mjordans cup!</p>
<p>cows, your an idiet- he knows more java than you. You might think he knows nothing, that is because he never releases anything however he is very knowledgable</p>
