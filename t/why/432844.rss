    <title>Why?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why/432844</link>
    <description>Every one has a different experience with rsc which is why this topic is being made. I am studying what players find in a game to be interesting and fun (this goes for multiple games) but since this is a rsc section lets keep it about rsc. Id like to know how you were introduced to rsc and what caught your attention. Then if you can, elaborate on the different features/aspects of the game.</description>

Me, Arch Silver &amp; Low Fighter use to run the castle, Miss guise like Xxkillersxx, 311 Deaths, The Jackyl, Yogiispure, Mystic004, Maddeath, Atlantian, Poets Rule, Official (Plate Pure), War Elixir (Plate Pure), Out 4 Fun, Then you had Blick, D A V I etc, Then there was PBS like Dark–Ness, D E S I R E… A S H L E Y (Think she had a 30 DEF, a High 90+ Def and a PB) Maybe mistaken about her PB. Could carry the list on forever! Good old Days!</p>

Problem is though the game doesn’t really work with a higher experience rate. The value of items depreciates because they are easier to refine and obtain, far less time is spent leveling characters and thus players are less invested in the game.</p>
<p>There’s a reason most mmorpgs have slow experience rates and that’s to essentially force you to repeat the same content, thereby keeping you playing longer but also investing your time in the character, creating an emotional attachment. Once you complete the leveling content in RSC what really is there to do other than stake or PK and the amount of fun and replayability you can get out of that when the rewards are essentially worthless (due to skewed economy) is limited at best.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Absolutely bang on. To elaborate on this, it’s also why there’s so many trolls and rule breakers in the community: they simply have nothing to lose, if they’re banned they can make the same character in a few days/weeks or just obtain one from a friend. With a really slow XP rate and limited access to the game players will respect it more. I’m sure there will be less online to start with but hopefully a tight-knit community that isn’t overrun with trolls will turn into a much nicer community like it was back on RSC. I know a lot of people dislike RSC private servers due to the constant ‘umad faggot?’ type of abuse they receive regardless of what they’re doing in-game. People were petrified about getting banned or muted which is why we’ve implemented a black mark and appeal section along with the in-game report abuse functionality. Hopefully a much more strict and consistent punishment system will help but like you said players have a choice, on RSC there was only one option so they either behaved or they couldn’t play the game they loved. The only way to replicate this is create a server that is clearly miles better than anything else and before now that’s only been achievable with content as everyone used the same base.</p>

<p>Great post &lt;3</p>
<p>And agreed about the slow economy![/quote]</p>
<p>Slow experience is unlikely to work in an environment where players have the choice of playing a server with a faster experience rate. Problem is though the game doesn’t really work with a higher experience rate. The value of items depreciates because they are easier to refine and obtain, far less time is spent leveling characters and thus players are less invested in the game.</p>
<p>There’s a reason most mmorpgs have slow experience rates and that’s to essentially force you to repeat the same content, thereby keeping you playing longer but also investing your time in the character, creating an emotional attachment. Once you complete the leveling content in RSC what really is there to do other than stake or PK and the amount of fun and replayability you can get out of that when the rewards are essentially worthless (due to skewed economy) is limited at best.</p>
