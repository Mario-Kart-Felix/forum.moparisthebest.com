        <blockquote>Yeah, But why not have avatars Sometimes people like having those., Never deny the beauty of art I did art ever since i was 4 and i'm aiming to be a engineer and a artist and i'm getting there.</blockquote>
There is a graphics section devoted to art. And hey maybe if you work hard and help out a lot you may be offered a moderator position. Then you can have your precious avatar. I have to agree with others though, I don't think it would be pretty.

The lack of avatars is a <span class="bbcode-i">good</span> thing. If you disagree, I invite a trial period - enjoy my eel-fucks-girl-anally avatar, anti-bestial fucktards.<br>
[/quote]Call Me a fuck-tard again and i’ll Kick your Balls so hard it’ll fall off while you run after them saying “Oh, Balls! Come back!”<br>
[/quote]… … … Yes. Quite. On the contrary, I’ve been considering the possibility of becoming a eunuch for a while now; you’d be doing me a favor. So, in conclusion, you are a fucktard, your taste in art is shit, and I can’t wait for your dreams of artistry/engineering to fail horribly.<br>
[/quote]Dude, you possiably don’t get it, maybe your fucked up sexually as i mean re-tardedly too. Art is better and can do more than you can you are just a lazy son of a bitch because art is what makes beauty in the outside and it has to make more so rain comes down cleaning the sunshine and gives it more of beauty if we had no art in this eternity we’d have no sight of beauty we’d see probably humans in a stick figure way oh wait, my bad we’d see nothing art is what life needs to image life how stupid can you get.<br>
[/quote]Not to mention that if i never thought of saying everything you thought was just a waste than the most of common things that people do alot but really do not rely on what and what not related to important worries in life really have a reason to stay because from what i said on my first post is we’d see nothing without art it’d be like we were blind in my ways of seeing it and think about it through engineering we’d not have it we’d never devolpe, think, and do everything possibly related to Creation dude i can explain shit that’d you not think all in one head and don’t say i’m retarded because for sure i’m not even close on a inch of words or letters anything to a size of special needs because people in my life who met me saw me or just randomly see me like seeing people in malls or shoping areas diffrent from other selling areas that I’M a VERY INTERESTING Boy to talk to at my age psha i think before i speak, i think before doing anything making stuff perfect is correctly true that nothing needs to be perfect or anything nor ANYONE is perfect some stuff need a perfectable adjust to it because it has to to get through life to live on successfly correct but i’m explaining things too intelligent to a little bitch with no respect at all means.<br>
[/quote]Youe aree ae narcissistice fucke fore thinkinge youe aree soe damne interestinge toe talke toe. Pleasee gete offe mye internetse soe Ie cane focuse one mye speeche ande continuee rereadinge Fertilee Valleye.<br>
