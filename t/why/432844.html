        <p>My friends who were bad at socializing (and still are) introduced me to it, and I enjoyed it because it was an alternate, non-judgmental reality.

        <p>For me, a friend I used to run a website with started playing a new game and he showed less and less interest in our projects. He kept saying he was having a ‘RuneScape break’ which used to annoy me a lot. After a while I decided to check it out. I had never really been a gamer but it always interested me how things were done and made.</p>
<p>I loaded it up and as simple as RSC was, it was actually incredibly confusing for a first time player who was like 12-13 at the time. He told me to train on the Chickens in Lumbridge and gave me some items that at the time I thought was really good. My XP kept going up and I was pretty proud that I could kill Cows all day healing myself with their meat after cooking it on a fire that I had lit.</p>
<p>It got to the point where I was really jealous of anyone who had better items than me and went on a quest to get rich, spending all day sat in Varrock buying and selling stuff…</p>
<p>Eventually all F2P was explored and it got a bit tiring (this was before I knew what the wilderness was really). I got membership and began training at the Guard Dogs in Ardougne. I then made friends with I Wicked I/Zar Family 2/Adx1/Sue Me/Azn Purity (etc) and was able to train all day at the wildrness axes without being disturbed by anyone which was a huge plus as it was really fast XP and usually all the spots were taken on every server, and if they weren’t then you would be kicked out very shortly after arriving anyway. I gained levels quickly and then started to get jealous of them having fun killing people during their training sessions so started gaining magic levels and joining them with pathetic stats like 70 54 85 with 85 magic… Although they were awful it was the magic side of things that helped. I had a pretty much unlimited income on there so just fired as many runes as I could. I was eventually 99 magic before I was even 85hp and it was all purely from the wilderness.</p>
<p>After I had good enough stats to defend myself (88 70 96 or something) I began mainly PKing on F2P with Adx1/Sue Me. It was much more fun than training.</p>
<p>It just got addicting, really wanted 99hp but any time I had available I wanted to PK… I think I got to like 42m magic XP and was still only 93hp or something. RSC was then dying, RS2 was out and everyone was botting… I was intrigued by AutoRune and how it worked, ended up autoing to 99hp on the Scorpions in Legends Guild. My prayer was only like 70 though so level 120 was the highest I reached.</p>
<p>The XP was slow as hell so you was forced to AFK a lot, you wanted to protect your spot, it caused wars, you were forced to make friends and socialize.</p>
<p>Without low XP and lots of competing players RSC can’t be the same.</p>

        <p>Introduced by some friends at school. Prior to liking pvp and melee we used to “skill” to make money. Fish trout and salmon in edge, cook it, sell it for like 15k per inven at varrok level 1 wild. I Loved how it took a long time to get what you wanted. It made everything you owned seem better. I can remember mining those coal rocks east of draynor in the swamp, making certs and selling to get my cash for my first full rune set + 2h. Also 3 round combat. Leaving a dungeon / wild with low health, no food. Knowing if anything attacked you and you were dead so you had to plan your way around wild.</p>

        <p>What got me was hooked was the community. I always had a good friend to play with, we fished, mined, trained together. This community is crappy<br>
but I do eventually find some cool people. Almost pking was a most for me when I wasn’t busy playing with friends. Also quest, I enjoyed doing them.</p>

        <p>Id like to go further in depth with how much it meant to the player to gain levels, items and knowledge of the game.</p>
<p>When we all first played rsc it was fresh. You didn’t know what was around the next corner and you most likely didn’t know how to skill crafting. It was a new world and it was an adventure.</p>
<p>I was fascinated with the game when I could see other players. After playing Warcraft II, Starcraft I… I was always interested in playing with another player(s). The multiplayer end of rsc was very new. The first thing I did was pick up bronze daggers and sell them to the shop in lumbridge… I remember my first 100gp I felt accomplished.</p>
<p>What even made me more of a noob was that I thought “attack” raised the amount of damage you dealt … so I ended up having like 70 attack 40 str 30 def.</p>
<p>What really sucks is that since we all played rsc we have it memorized just about. So its lost its value, all we care about is who got what and who is the highest level.</p>
<p>I honestly believe the best thing for rsc (besides a replica low rate) is to just revamp the entire game completely. Different map, different quests, different rewards, bonuses, skilling is different etc etc. It would bring that freshness back to the game.</p>

ya very true. I think that if someone would come out with an official game that started with a tiny city (kind of like lumbridge) and slowly expanded a little at a time introducing new skills and quests as they went it would be hella successful. Sadly I must say that rsc as is will not appeal to most newcomers, and mainly only to players of the past. (unless you have someone like Reines and what RSCD was) But as long as Jagex has the copyrights to rsc nothing like this is feasible in my opinion. In order for a game like runescape classic to succeed, it must be a real game. Not a private server, an official game with full on advertisement, no pressure from a legal perspective, and a new playerbase not consisting of trolls.</p>
<p>Ontopic,<br>
My rsc experience began when a friend introduced my cousin and I to the game. At first, I had no interest whatsoever mainly because I didnt understand the point of it and why I needed to constantly click on monsters to gain “xp”. Thats probably because I never played any online game that put me in complete control of the game. RuneScape Classic is like no other game. It makes you strive to be the best. You put in time, you get results. As much as we try to “win runescape” it isnt possible yet we continued to put in the time to try. I remember just sitting there watching my friend fish lobster in karamja and I would be amazed that he had 40 fishing. Then when he got members and could fish at the fishing guild, I was uber jealous to say the least.</p>
<p>Sadly those days are gone, and jagex probably has no intention of giving us those days back.</p>

        <p>It really is interesting how we all were low levels once and someone smithing mithril and we are all like OMG thats insane and they would tell us their smith level was 52 or whatever. I enjoy how rsc puts you in your place. If you don’t thrive for it but you attempt you end up in your rightful place among other members somewhere in the middle.</p>
