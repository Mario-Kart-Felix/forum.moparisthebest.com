    <title>Why?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why/17215</link>
    <description>alright i made a server thats cheezscape(first time makeing a server) based,i can log in to it,but if i log out i cant log back in so i have to turn off the bot then turn it back on and i cant go on the same user name  i was on,and i want to edit it so ppl can join but when i try to edit it for example,lets say i want the title to say welcome to yo69scape,on my clent.java i edit so its like that,but when i log in its still welcome to cheezscape, and so i looked on my clent.java again and it was still edited to say welcome to yo69scape.

i dont know why it does that but i know thier is someone that knows the answer and whoever they shall be i will make them a admin on my server if they want ...if they help



sincerly,
mike</description>
