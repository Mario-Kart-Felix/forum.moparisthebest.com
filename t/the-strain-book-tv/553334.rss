    <title>The Strain - Book/TV</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-strain-book-tv/553334</link>
    <description>I have been watching the show &quot;The Strain&quot; and absolutely love the combination of vampirism and science. I recently began to read the books and still on the first one but I definitely think it is a great horror show/book with a great plot. Anyone else read the books or watched the show?</description>
