    <description>[size=40pt]Bass Guitar[/size]

I can happily release This bass guitar as the first guitar model that has actualy been released! Unlike some people that i can mension [cough]Silent CJ with his SG and His guitar and all the other guitars[/cough].

This is my first Model and therefore not my best. Well when i say &quot;My&quot; really i never made the model. It got it as a 3ds format and I reshaped it, reduced polygons and resized. Of course converted it to the Recognised RS Format. Plus i have actualy got pics of it in the game.

Place this is the normal area in your [b]class8.java[/b]

[code]if(i == 16023) // ITEM ID
{
        class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
        class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Play&quot;; 
        class8.anInt174 = 11111; // Drop/Inv Model
        class8.anInt165 = 11112; // Male Wield Model
        class8.anInt200 = 11112; // Female Wield
        class8.anInt188 = -1; // Male arms/sleeves
        class8.anInt164 = -1; // Female arms/sleeves
	class8.anInt181 = 850; // Zoom 
	class8.anInt190 = 498; // Rotate up/down 
	class8.anInt198 = 1300; // Rotate right/left
	class8.anInt169 = -1; // Position in inv, increase to move right
	class8.anInt194 = -1; // Position in inv, increase to move up						
class8.aString170 = &quot;Bass&quot;; // Item Name
class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;Whoa, Nice Guitar Dude!&quot;.getBytes(); // Item Examine
      }[/code]

At the Moment the Itme ID is at 16023.. Change this to your Desired ID

[size=20pt]Download[/size]
This includes both Wield and Drop/Inv Models as follows:

[ul][li]11111 - Drop/Inv Model[/li]
[li]11112 - Wield Model[/li][/ul]

<p>well if I put the guitar forward is other arm would look stupid! at the moment it does look like he is holding it by the fretboard (Even though there isnt one)</p>
<p>Someone suggested that you can change the way of hold the item within the server. Which Item Do you think is most suitable?</p>

<p>I can happily release This bass guitar as the first guitar model that has actualy been released! Unlike some people that i can mension [cough]Silent CJ with his SG and His guitar and all the other guitars[/cough].</p>
<p>This is my first Model and therefore not my best. Well when i say “My” really i never made the model. It got it as a 3ds format and I reshaped it, reduced polygons and resized. Of course converted it to the Recognised RS Format. Plus i have actualy got pics of it in the game.</p>
