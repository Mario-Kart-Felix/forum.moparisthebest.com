    <description>[code]Program circlemouse_unbeatable;
//select any window with the crosshairs.
//Circlemouse_unbeatable program by Gokon. similar goal to ron&#39;s &quot;try to shut this script off&quot;
//but this one doesn&#39;t open windows :P
//all im trying to do with this is make you shut off your computer.

keydown(&#39;d&#39;);
if(iskeydown(&#39;s&#39;))then
keyup(&#39;s&#39;);
if(isFkeydown(4))then
Fkeyup(4);
if(iskeydown(&#39;a&#39;))then
keyup(&#39;a&#39;);
end.[/code]
the part that doesn&#39;t work is where i try to make it prevent the stop script, pause script, and close window shortcuts. for some reason it doesn&#39;t want to recognize the semi colons after what i want it to do when it detects certain keys being pressed. also if once this is fixed anyone can beat it without logging out, shutting down or restarting their computer, let me know. :D</description>
