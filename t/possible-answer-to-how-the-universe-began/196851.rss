    <title>Possible answer to how the universe began</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/possible-answer-to-how-the-universe-began/196851</link>
    <description>I just thought of something...

Maybe it never did. Think about it. Theoretically, there is no end or begining to the universe(space), which could possibly mean that time never began...

Just as our minds can barely handle that there is no end to space, maybe it is the same to time... like... everything was aways here... period.</description>

<p>thats god, a being which is captable of creating everything, who keeps the whole world in place, and equally, he listens to individual people’s prayers,<br>
he is capable of infinate things</p>
<p>i like the infinate part, it allows you to screw over thiests with mathematics,<br>
eg. If god is infinatly powerful, can he create something more powerful then himself</p>

Both of them rotate around their sun, like Earth rotates around the sun here, except they don’t rotate themselves like Earth does (No day, no night).  One side is completely dark and freezing cold, and the other is extremely light and boiling hot.  It may be too cold to live on, but, if the greenhouse effect has taken place, it may just be at the right temperature for us to settle down (On the cold side).</p>
<p>I can’t remember about the other one, I think that one was too close to the sun, but the cold side just might be cold enough for us to survive.</p>

<p>I personally am against Catholicism myself, because I think there are a lot of useless rituals involved, but anyway.  The reason atheists detest Christianity is not because of the theory behind it, but because of the way it has been applied.  Such as the Crusades, etc.</p>

<p>the reason is:<br>
atheists cannot simply ignore theists anymore then homosexuals can ignore straight people<br>
we have to understand religion to understand things like the Northern Ireland Troubles, Isreal-Palastine, and why there was just a suicide bomber in our towns.</p>
<p>in my own country, there was a war between catholic-christians and orthadox-christians. it was a fairly typical war, a lot of people died, of all beliefs, ect ect<br>
but in the 40 years before that, when everyone was “officially” atheist, there was total peace and prosperity between everyone. After the fall of socialism, religious people started killing each other.</p>
<p>i mean, come on, catholic-christianity and orthadox-christianity are barely distinguishable.</p>
<p>in answer to your question, atheists <span class="bbcode-i">have to</span> take religion into account, we have no choice, and we don’t the way we <span class="bbcode-i">have to</span>, we would much prefer if there was no religion. So we debate against it.</p>
<p>the world would be a much nicer place if everyone kept their beliefs, or lack of them, to themselves.</p>

<p>I mean, if God isn’t from another planet, then he <span class="bbcode-i">must</span> have sent his son Jesus to Earth.  I just can’t believe that the people who wrote the Bible were so intelligent.  It’s written with hidden messages and morals riddled throughout, is it not?  Jesus didn’t explain to them how to write like that…  And I’m pretty damn sure you couldn’t have got an education at that time that was really advanced like that.  Am I over exaggerating a little?  Maybe I am; maybe it wasn’t written as well as I say it was.</p>
<p>But then again, maybe God gave the people who wrote the Bible the gift of writing, and great intelligence.  Who knows.  It’s hard to make ends meet.</p>
<p>I just can’t believe it.  It’s not too hard to comprehend- it’s just that, as a human, I’m a totally stupid little shit, and I’m arrogant, too.  In this society, it’s extremely hard to believe in God.  I can overcome it sometimes, but most of the time, my social life interrupts with my belief in God.</p>

<p>Too bad people from third world countries are hungry, thirsty, and dying from flu.  If life is all we have to live for, it gives their existence absolutely no meaning.  And that’s where the Bible comes in.  It gives promise to those who have nothing in this world, promising them a better existence after death.</p>
<p>And God and religion used in the wrong context has ended in death, suffering, and ignorance.<br>
And science used in the wrong context has also ended up in death, suffering, and ignorance.</p>
<p>Next time you use gross generalizations, at least make sure it is only applicable to religion.</p>

<p>God did not condone his actions.  In fact, if you read a bit more, it was obvious that Lot was a bad example.  My understanding is that he saved Lot because he was related to Abraham, with whom He made His covenant.</p>

<p>Well I guess the Bible is assuming that the reader is not near retarded.</p>

<p>you know when one days passes into the next<br>
time is change, if time doesn’t move, nothing will change</p>

</aside>
<p>All I said was that your comparison between time and water was null.  Nothing more.  Furthermore, the Bible uses the word “day” to describe the first seven days.  Show me where it says those days were 86 400 seconds as it is today.  The rotation of the earth in the first millenia of creation was most definitely not the same as it is now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Day does not mean like the day we have today, it can be period that was In all from millions to milliards of years.</p>
<p>[/quote]The Bible says <span class="bbcode-i">seven days</span>, not <span class="bbcode-i">some unspecified amount of time</span>. You mold the time specifications to allow for science, but Genesis is just too damn specific. When it says day, it means day. When it says the first bitch came from the first man, it means God ripped out Adam’s rib and called it “Eve”, not “God created a female to coexist with the male, and the offspring of the two’s offspring evolved over the next near-eternity, eventually creating a human male and female”. No room for loose interpretation.[/quote]<br>
Yes I know that bible say 7 days, but like some said, Genesis 1 can be figurative and not literal.<br>
Genesis 1 is proved that is not literal, since the science have an other explanation.</p>
<p>Maybe that say that he (God) made the world in 7 days was an easy way to say that he made a big mass into the center of Universe, make it explode (Big Bang), made the physic rules, make all the Atoms and molecule and how they react and made some sort of life on earth. (After that I know the Scientist have not found a way to create life of that so was on the earth before life.)<br>
And then do small fixes on the living things in a long long time so they created many sort of Animals, bird, fish and the Humans we see today.</p>
