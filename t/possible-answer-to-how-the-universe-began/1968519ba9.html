Maybe it never did. Think about it. Theoretically, there is no end or begining to the universe(space), which could possibly mean that time never began...

<p>theres a lot of bad mixed up in the bible, along with the good,</p>
<p>listen to this story for a minute,<br>
theres a story in genesis, of a town called Sodom, it is about to be destroyed, but God wants to save one man and his family, Lot, Abraham’s nephew so he sends two (male) angels to warn them.</p>
<p>the angels are welcomed into the house and greeted nicely, however, the other townspeople go to the house and demands the angels so they can have sex with them.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">“Where are the men which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them”</span> (Genesis 19:5)</p>
<p>(note: in this context, <span class="bbcode-i">to know</span> means <span class="bbcode-i">to have sex with</span></p>
<p>Lot refuses the demand, and instead offers his two virgin daughters,<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">“I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes; only unto these men do nothing”</span><br>
(Genesis 19:7-8)</p>
<p>so the men take the daughters and gang-rape them all night.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">“They knew her and abused her all night until the morning; and when the day began to spring, they let her go.”</span></p>
<p>btw, this town was called Sodom, thats probably the root of the word <span class="bbcode-i">to sodomize</span></p>
<p>I’m not saying the bible teaches you to have gay sex with angels, or to treat women like that.</p>
<p>But its obvious that non of you believe this is moral behavior, you’ve filtered it out, how did you do that?<br>
the answer is, you already had morals, and knew what was right and wrong,<br>
but if you didn’t learn morals from the bible, where did you learn them from?</p>
<p>my point is, you don’t need the bible or any holy book to teach you morals.[/quote]</p>
<p>You seem to have missed the whole point of that story, the city was certainly immoral, that is why God wiped it off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>To answer all of your questions:<br>
a)  God allows for free choice.  If you choose to ignore Him, He will choose to ignore you. (Questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)<br>
b)  The earth is not supposed to be a utopia.  That’s what Heaven is there for.  (Questions 1, 2, 3, 4)</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:40, topic:196851”]why is some parts of the bible literal and some figurative, who are we to decide which is which?<br>
and if someone interprets it differently to you, that must mean one of you has the wrong interpretation.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s where research comes in, and that’s why Christianity is not a blind faith as some people would like you to think.  You take a verse, look at various translations including literal from Greek/Hebrew, and deciper the meaning that way.  In some instances it will be clear.  Others, it won’t be.  And that’s where opinion comes in, and that’s why there are so many branches of Christianity.  But in the end, it doesn’t make much difference.</p>

<p>God did not condone his actions.  In fact, if you read a bit more, it was obvious that Lot was a bad example.  My understanding is that he saved Lot because he was related to Abraham, with whom He made His covenant.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:43, topic:196851”]what I’m trying to say here is, no Christian copies that part of the bible, but they still copy the “moral” parts,<br>

<p>Well I guess the Bible is assuming that the reader is not near retarded.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:43, topic:196851”]you know when one days passes into the next<br>

<p>All I said was that your comparison between time and water was null.  Nothing more.  Furthermore, the Bible uses the word “day” to describe the first seven days.  Show me where it says those days were 86 400 seconds as it is today.  The rotation of the earth in the first millenia of creation was most definitely not the same as it is now.</p>

<p>God did not condone his actions.  In fact, if you read a bit more, it was obvious that Lot was a bad example.  My understanding is that he saved Lot because he was related to Abraham, with whom He made His covenant.</p>

</aside>
<p>days was shorter when the earth was formed, the earth rotated faster</p>
<p>because of friction between the tides of the sea and the earth, as time goes on, the time it takes for the earth to rotate once is longer.<br>
they worked that out by looking at fossils of coral, and seeing a solar eclipse was in the wrong place if the length of a day was constant, then deduced the rotation of earth was slowing.</p>
<p>also, the moon is getting further away as it orbits, when the moon was first created, it would have looked much bigger then it does now.<br>
theres a moon around uranus which is getting closer and closer to the planet as it orbits, eventually it should break up, and make rings like saturn’s</p>
<p>so you’re correct in saying the length of a day is not the same, but it gives God even less time to create things.</p>

Yes I know that bible say 7 days, but like some said, Genesis 1 can be figurative and not literal.<br>
Genesis 1 is proved that is not literal, since the science have an other explanation.</p>
<p>Maybe that say that he (God) made the world in 7 days was an easy way to say that he made a big mass into the center of Universe, make it explode (Big Bang), made the physic rules, make all the Atoms and molecule and how they react and made some sort of life on earth. (After that I know the Scientist have not found a way to create life of that so was on the earth before life.)<br>
And then do small fixes on the living things in a long long time so they created many sort of Animals, bird, fish and the Humans we see today.</p>

<p>The Bible says <span class="bbcode-i">seven days</span>, not <span class="bbcode-i">some unspecified amount of time</span>. You mold the time specifications to allow for science, but Genesis is just too damn specific. When it says day, it means day. When it says the first bitch came from the first man, it means God ripped out Adam’s rib and called it “Eve”, not “God created a female to coexist with the male, and the offspring of the two’s offspring evolved over the next near-eternity, eventually creating a human male and female”. No room for loose interpretation.</p>

<p>Too bad people from third world countries are hungry, thirsty, and dying from flu.  If life is all we have to live for, it gives their existence absolutely no meaning.  And that’s where the Bible comes in.  It gives promise to those who have nothing in this world, promising them a better existence after death.</p>
<p>And God and religion used in the wrong context has ended in death, suffering, and ignorance.<br>
And science used in the wrong context has also ended up in death, suffering, and ignorance.</p>
<p>Next time you use gross generalizations, at least make sure it is only applicable to religion.</p>
<p>Science can only prove things to a point.</p>

<p>I wasn’t directly pointing at you, but really, all the christians in my class (quite a few actually, and they aren’t stupid either, I go to the second highest form of education in my country so they should have at least some brains) say that God made scientists invent stuff.</p>
<p>Oh and about those third world people, most of them believe in some strange god, not in the christian god.</p>

        <p>I’ll need to read the Bible sometime.  I really don’t know much about God (I’m a Christian… barely), and as I age, I become more and more intrigued by it.</p>
<p>I seem to believe that ‘God’ was of another race; much more superior to us humans on Earth; from a different planet/area in our/other galaxies.  It really is the most plausible explanation I can come up with.  Can anyone (xxlegitxx, more specifically) tell me if it’s wrong to think such things about God?</p>
<p>I mean, if God isn’t from another planet, then he <span class="bbcode-i">must</span> have sent his son Jesus to Earth.  I just can’t believe that the people who wrote the Bible were so intelligent.  It’s written with hidden messages and morals riddled throughout, is it not?  Jesus didn’t explain to them how to write like that…  And I’m pretty damn sure you couldn’t have got an education at that time that was really advanced like that.  Am I over exaggerating a little?  Maybe I am; maybe it wasn’t written as well as I say it was.</p>
<p>But then again, maybe God gave the people who wrote the Bible the gift of writing, and great intelligence.  Who knows.  It’s hard to make ends meet.</p>
<p>I just can’t believe it.  It’s not too hard to comprehend- it’s just that, as a human, I’m a totally stupid little shit, and I’m arrogant, too.  In this society, it’s extremely hard to believe in God.  I can overcome it sometimes, but most of the time, my social life interrupts with my belief in God.</p>
<p>All of those who are arguing against Catholicism and the existence of God: why are you doing it?  If you do not believe in God, then that’s your business, it’s your loss.  It’s a great faith.  It exclaims love for one another and opposes everything evil.</p>
<p>What’s bad about it?</p>

<p>the reason is:<br>
atheists cannot simply ignore theists anymore then homosexuals can ignore straight people<br>
we have to understand religion to understand things like the Northern Ireland Troubles, Isreal-Palastine, and why there was just a suicide bomber in our towns.</p>
<p>in my own country, there was a war between catholic-christians and orthadox-christians. it was a fairly typical war, a lot of people died, of all beliefs, ect ect<br>
but in the 40 years before that, when everyone was “officially” atheist, there was total peace and prosperity between everyone. After the fall of socialism, religious people started killing each other.</p>
<p>i mean, come on, catholic-christianity and orthadox-christianity are barely distinguishable.</p>
<p>in answer to your question, atheists <span class="bbcode-i">have to</span> take religion into account, we have no choice, and we don’t the way we <span class="bbcode-i">have to</span>, we would much prefer if there was no religion. So we debate against it.</p>
<p>the world would be a much nicer place if everyone kept their beliefs, or lack of them, to themselves.</p>
