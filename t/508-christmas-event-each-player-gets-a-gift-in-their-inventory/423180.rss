    <title>508 Christmas event (Each player gets a gift in their inventory)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-christmas-event-each-player-gets-a-gift-in-their-inventory/423180</link>
    <description>is there any way that starting on a certain date each player gets a present in their inventory. And then it ends on a certain date. I dont mind starting it manually and cancelling manually, but i just want each player to get an item in their inventory. thanks.</description>

character files&gt;character then go into the bank section and add it lol.[/quote]A lot of work… People will also get the items if they don’t log in for Christmas. Just add a boolean to the player class like ‘receivedHolidayGift’. Then after the server sends the welcome sendMessage to the client, add something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (!receivedHolidayGift) {
    addItemToInventory(GIFT_ITEM_ID);
    receivedHolidayGift = true;
}</code></pre>
<p>Remember to save the boolean to their save file, otherwise they’ll receive the gift every time they login.</p>
