    <title>Adding silab cache to a client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-silab-cache-to-a-client/430241</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

I am trying to run a Project Czar server, but I have no client to run with it so I am going to have to make one. I am getting nulled items in some of the shops and they are all silab items. Some of the silab items work though which is strange.

Anyone know how to fix this?

If not, I have a couple of caches around my desktop that I can add, but I don&#39;t know exactly how to add them. I tried googling around but couldn&#39;t find anything that helps.

Thanks!</description>
