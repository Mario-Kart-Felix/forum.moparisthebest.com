    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/market-thread-old-school-community-market-place/509499</link>
    <description>This is just a thread intended for the whole RS07 community to post what they&#39;re buying or selling! Here&#39;s a small list of rules that you need to abide by when buying or selling items on this thread.


[ol][li]You may not offer real life money for any items or gold in RS07. If someone still decides to offer real life money for any RS07 items or gold, your post will be reported and staff will deal with you as they feel.[/li]
[li]You may only buy and sell [b]RS07[/b] items here! If anything EOC is posted here, your post will be reported and staff will deal with you as they feel.[/li]
[li]You must use must clearly state that you are [b]Buying[/b] or [b]Selling[/b] in your post and you must clearly state the price you want for an item/ to pay for an item and what item you&#39;re actually selling or buying.[/li]
[li]When you post your price, you post your price. To keep spam to a minimum, I ask you to please leave all negotiating to PM or ingame RS07.[/li]
[li]Please keep arguing out of this thread. If you don&#39;t agree with a price or you think something is &quot;INSANELY&quot; over priced, let the poster know through PM so you and the poster can negotiate. Keeping spam to a minimum would be greatly appreciated![/li]
[li]Leaving your RS07 username is not required, however it is recommended to way you want a buyer/seller to contact you.[/li]
[li]Please make sure all of your posts are relevant to the thread&#39;s topic. All off topic posts will be reported to keep this thread clean and as user-friendly as possible. :D[/li]
[li]All Global Forum rules apply to this thread also which can be found: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354311.0.html]Here[/url].[/li][/ol]


If you do not know the current price of an item you&#39;re wanting to Buy or Sell, than check out the Mopar IRC. If you join the RS07 channel (#rs07) and type in &quot;!average &lt;item name&gt;&quot;, the IRC will give you the average item value. However, if you want more accurate prices, its encouraged to go go west Varrock in trading worlds to find the actual street prices that people are using! :D

It is recommended, not required, to use this reformatted application for friendlier use.

Here is an example of how the IRC works:

Edits are bound to happen on this thread, so make sure to check to see if its been updated every now and then. :P

[center][b][size=14pt]This thread is only for trading RS07 Items/Gold for RS07 Items/Gold.[/size][/b][/center]</description>

[/tt][/quote]Thank for for posting something partially relevant to the thread topic. I will say that i did make this thread because of the other thread, but not for the intention of stick-fishing. I made it to make a thread with a so called “backbone” so people have rules to follow and a more organized place to communicate.</p>

              <p>This is just a thread intended for the whole RS07 community to post what they’re buying or selling! Here’s a small list of rules that you need to abide by when buying or selling items on this thread.</p>
<p>[ol][li]You may not offer real life money for any items or gold in RS07. If someone still decides to offer real life money for any RS07 items or gold, your post will be reported and staff will deal with you as they feel.[/li]<br>
[li]You may only buy and sell <span class="bbcode-b">RS07</span> items here! If anything EOC is posted here, your post will be reported and staff will deal with you as they feel.[/li]<br>
[li]You must use must clearly state that you are <span class="bbcode-b">Buying</span> or <span class="bbcode-b">Selling</span> in your post and you must clearly state the price you want for an item/ to pay for an item and what item you’re actually selling or buying.[/li]<br>
[li]When you post your price, you post your price. To keep spam to a minimum, I ask you to please leave all negotiating to PM or ingame RS07.[/li]<br>
[li]Please keep arguing out of this thread. If you don’t agree with a price or you think something is “INSANELY” over priced, let the poster know through PM so you and the poster can negotiate. Keeping spam to a minimum would be greatly appreciated![/li]<br>
[li]Leaving your RS07 username is not required, however it is recommended to way you want a buyer/seller to contact you.[/li]<br>
[li]Please make sure all of your posts are relevant to the thread’s topic. All off topic posts will be reported to keep this thread clean and as user-friendly as possible. :D[/li]<br>
[li]All Global Forum rules apply to this thread also which can be found: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,354311.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here</a>.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>If you do not know the current price of an item you’re wanting to Buy or Sell, than check out the Mopar IRC. If you join the RS07 channel (<span class="hashtag">#rs07</span>) and type in "!average ", the IRC will give you the average item value. However, if you want more accurate prices, its encouraged to go go west Varrock in trading worlds to find the actual street prices that people are using! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>It is recommended, not required, to use this reformatted application for friendlier use.</p>
<p><code>
IGN:
Buy/sell:
Amount:
Price:</code></p>
<p>Here is an example of how the IRC works:<br>
