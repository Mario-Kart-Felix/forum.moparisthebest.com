    <description>Again, the poll is just for fun, if you want to count, post a reason.

Also note that creeper explosions will still hurt and/or kill the player just like before, they just won&#39;t damage blocks.

Now a quick history:
Creeper block damage was always disabled, if only because it&#39;s just annoying and frustrating, and has the tendency to make the landscape look like a war-zone.  With the creation of World 2, which was supposed to be a small world where everyone got along with each other well and worked together to defend against the evil mobs of minecraft, everyone wanted creeper block damage on, to make the server as close to vanilla as possible.  The plugin finally got fixed so I could enable creeper damage in w2 and disable creepers in w1, so I did it.  Since then it seems there has been a constant stream of pissing and moaning complaining about it.  Meh.

Now for my personal stance:
We already have a creeper-less world, world 1.  And there are ways to combat against &#39;creeper luring&#39;, many of which I&#39;ve spelled out before.  If you don&#39;t want to protect against it, then if it happens to you, tough.  You can protect against it, or you can go to world 1.  If you want to play in a hard world where everything is as-vanilla as possible, then world 2 is for you.</description>

[no comma indicating a single statement])(i also agree with matty in how that ur statment to tom b’s statment with “since when” had potential to be misleading and was somewhat vague  sparking this dispute.) and can only agree to disagree and should respect eachothers entitlement to their view and end it there. i am not siding with either of you however.</p>

They say we should keep PvP on it’s because it’s “part of the games fun”, and yet the hypocrisy doesn’t end there. Matty fails to see the point I’m trying to make, it doesn’t matter what is ‘part of the game’ or not, it matters what people ENJOY as part of the game. That’s the purpose of games, right? To have fun? I get no fun out of PvP, all it does for me is cause unwanted stress. I get a thrill from fear of creepers though, and I’m sure it’s the opposite for some people. To me, in either case, changing the game to please one side is a bad idea. And by the looks of the poll, it seems it’s pretty evenly split to me.</p>

<p>Chatting is not game design… you can do that anywhere. But go ahead and list features that were designed for only multiplayer, and we’ll see which ones I think are real minecraft.</p>
<p>PvP is in SMP Vanilla, with a feature to turn it OFF and ON with no plugins. Creepers are in SMP and SSP, with no feature to turn the explosion damage off or on. Which one do you think is more about real minecraft? If you don’t say creepers… I don’t know what else to say.</p>

Ohh, creepers were added before PVP so therefore PVP isn’t part of the game. Makes sense. Maybe something should only class as being part of the game if it was introduced in the initial test release?</p>
<p>EDIT: Just read back a few more posts to make sure I wasn’t taking this out of context and being an idiot, but it looks like your being even more illogical than I originally thought. Nice.</p>

              <p>i have to admit, i agree with with tom b on this, someone could place lava near a hose, have a creeper blow up a trail for it to ooze down on, and burn up a house. its just like griefing eccept u must control where the creepers blow up on. i say turn it off. its just hidden griefing waiting to happen.</p>

              <p>I think it there should be creeper block damage. It is a part of the game, and people tend to build up on resources over time, so it shouldn’t be a problem if a part of somebodies home gets blown up. Also if they don’t want the landscape to look like a warzone, then they could spare a few dirt blocks and fix the hole. That’s my opinion on it anyway.</p>

<p>Things like this create disputes, which are usually then turned into a fight when PVP is on and that’s not good on such a small world. I’m sure Davidi2 will remember his old city on W1 with Frell, it only took one thing then it escalated leading to the death of it.</p>

<p>other then that, any other block can be blown up so anyone property is accessible, and until pvp is turned on we cant do anything about it but report and fix what the griefer blows up. i personally dont want a huge wall around the city, they are quite tacky.</p>

From the last thread:[quote author=Davidi2 link=topic=525707.msg3828369#msg3828369 date=1322366719]<br>
Anyways, on topic. Creepers have always been a part of Minecraft, how can you guys support PvP at all and not support creepers? We honestly may as well make it a creative world, but “oh no I still want to be able to kill people and loot and raid, I just don’t want to ever risk <span class="bbcode-u">MY</span> stuff”<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Zuppers wants it off if we can’t rollback explosions I believe</p>
<p>To be honest, if we turn it off, we should also make looting an offense. The logic is the same, ‘its your own fault for not defending your stuff better’. I’d be fine with this.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>exactly, its your own fault if someone gets a wild hair up their ass and brings a creeper along with them to your property and blows it up when you are sleeping at night.[/quote]Um what? I’m assuming you’re being sarcastic, but if you are you realize that is completely irrelevance to anything I said right? This has nothing to do with people getting angry with you and wanting to destroy your stuff, it’s the concept of defending your items/property from other people. (This is not including accidental explosions of course)</p>
