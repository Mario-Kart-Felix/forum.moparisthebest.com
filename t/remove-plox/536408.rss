              <p>Well, you didn’t come to a bad place there’s quite a few talented guys here who can help you out. Firstly I would say that in 2 months unless you work 23 hours a day then I can’t see you mastering any languages. I’ve got something like 22 tutorials posted throughout this board but most of them are outdated now so I wouldn’t suggest using them for anything more than seeing the way I worked through a problem. <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,617112.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">This tutorial</a> is probably my only up to date one and it’s the one I’ve put the most work into.</p>
<p>Besides following tutorials posted in here and asking for help in this forum you’re going to need to get a couple books. You can get a tonne of free e-books relating to everything so there’s no expense on your part here. There’s also a couple good iOS apps for this, PHP+ is a great buy at something around £0.69p, great reference (albeit slightly outdated) but it gives you a great background.</p>
<p>You’ve said that you don’t want to be looking at basic tutorials and that’s fair enough but a lot of that is experience over anything else. You should always have some sort of reference to guide you along. Let me know any specific details you need.</p>

              <p><a href="http://w3schools.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://w3schools.com/</a> this is all you need to know. Not sure what any guru would have with opinion on that website but I’ve used it and I can produce an amateur website. I’ve done next to nothing with PHP and javascript but from what I’ve seen 2 and a half months (assuming you’re from NZ or Australia) is plenty of time to get to the top of the class. Do not always rely on tutorials, practical work is best. Problem solving is even better.</p>
