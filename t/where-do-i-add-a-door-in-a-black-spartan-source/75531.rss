    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-do-i-add-a-door-in-a-black-spartan-source/75531</link>
    <description>Hi. i&#39;m trying to add a tut island.

I have already put in all the NPC&#39;s in the spawn list.

But now i only have to add the doors and the NPC&#39;s talkings.

i have made those already in TextPad.

but now i dont know where to put it into my source.

*Please note that its a Blacnk Spartan source.
- i have tryd serveral TuT&#39;s but they all say i need to look for zammy mage.
  Witch i dont got in my source.

This is an exsample of the first door.

[code]if (objectID == 6743)   // Tut island door 1
                {
                ReplaceObject(objectX,objectY,2630, -2);
[/code]

Please help me on this one.</description>
