    <title>503 what is it?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/503-what-is-it/228137</link>
    <description>Hi all, 
        I have heard talk of RS2 503, What is this? I have seen some of the clients and servers but what is differant about them? 
Some people said the programming was differant and harder is this true?
LOl sorry if im seeming a bit dim, But I have only just got back into moparscape development and suddenly there is somthing called 503.
I was just wandering if anyone could tell me.
Thanks very much
