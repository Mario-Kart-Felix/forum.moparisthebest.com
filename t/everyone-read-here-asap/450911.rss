    <description>server has been shut down completely as the owner did take action on hacking people on emulation and stork pk aswell as lorsc ( a server of 8-15 ppl ) i will not be the 1 to be ip banned for this as i am not the owner of Revamped

the owner is snemo he hacked people on emulation, stork pk, lorsc also given out many of ppl&#39;s ip addresses and has tried to ddos emulation, sean and will ddosed stork pk for a week straight when they lyed to me saying they didnt sorry for all the conviences.

I would like to give my appologizes to my friends that has been screwed over from this server. mod will leaked out the source giving the source to a bunch of ppl who was hacked on stork pk. emulation and lorsc. even though i owned this account i would like for it to be banned snemo aka sean should be ipbanned from moparscape for giving out ppl&#39;s account info in game to emulation, stork, and lorsc. he also took apon on himself to hack 3 level 123&#39;s on emulation and sold there account&#39;s with items for real life cash. as my time of being here i did not know this was going on until the last few moments of me quitting this server. and like i said before Panu, Pryu, Bryan(lorsc owner). im sorry for everything that has happend on your servers also sorry for the advertisements and ddos attacks. there was pictures of neonx talking to panu in my last topic admitting to attacking stork pk he claims it wasnt him when it was. Alex aka kalculater has picture proof of ip addresses being given out in game sadly people didnt feel safe and started using proxies. 

Due to all of this happening i believe i am quitting the rsc community as its not as like it used to be people are too power hungry specialy if they get a power trip. goodbye everyone ill be around 

 i will be around if anyone wants to get ahold of me btm_darkhood@live.com talk to yall soon

              <p>I do indeed have proof of him giving out IP addresses in game. Sean gave IPs to Will who admitted to posting on hackf0rums for particular IPs to be hacked for USD. He has a website that is affiliated with hackf0rums also.</p>
<p>Havent spoken to you much in the last few weeks Jut, am away for about a week more due to a music festival here in Australia. Speak soon mate.</p>
