    <description>My question: Where are the RS2 Client files located (the real client files), and how can you deob them using jad&#39;s deobber?

I&#39;ve already managed to decompile the loader, but all I get in theese files is some link to runescape_-1245624542.pack200 and runescape-123456542.j5. And of course, the .cab file, which, after closer examination, contains just the loader in condensed form. Probably as a method of integrity check.

Yeah. I once heard that it was (prefix).runescape.com/runescape.jar that contained the actual files... But I don&#39;t know if this is true. Somone help me out here? 

I just want to deob the newest client (the one runescape.com is using right now).</description>
