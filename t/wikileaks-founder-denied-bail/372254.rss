    <title>WikiLeaks Founder Denied Bail</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wikileaks-founder-denied-bail/372254</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A British judge sent Julian Assange to jail on Tuesday, denying bail to the WikiLeaks founder who vowed to fight efforts to extradite him to Sweden in a sex-crimes investigation.

A WikiLeaks spokesman said the flow of secret U.S. diplomatic cables would not be affected by Assange&#39;s legal troubles, nor by the group&#39;s increasingly rocky finances as both Visa and MasterCard cut off key funding methods.

&quot;This will not change our operation,&quot; Kristinn Hrafnsson told The Associated Press. As if to underline the point, WikiLeaks released a dozen new diplomatic cables, its first publication in more than 24 hours, including the details of a NATO defense plan for Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that prompted an indignant response from the Russian envoy to the alliance.

Assange turned himself in to Scotland Yard on Tuesday morning, and was sent to the City of Westminster Magistrates&#39; Court in the early afternoon. He showed no reaction as Judge Howard Riddle denied him bail and sent him to jail until his next extradition hearing on Dec. 14.

U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, visiting with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and U.S. troops in Afghanistan, was pleased that Assange was behind bars.

&quot;That sounds like good news to me,&quot; he said Tuesday.

Assange faces rape and sexual molestation allegations in one Swedish case and sexual molestation and unlawful coercion in another. He denies the allegations, which he and his lawyers claim stem from a &quot;dispute over consensual but unprotected sex&quot; dating back to August.

Riddle asked the 39-year-old Australian whether he understood that he could consent to be extradited to Sweden. Assange, dressed in a navy blue suit, cleared his throat and said: &quot;I understand that and I do not consent.&quot;
WikiLeaks Founder Arrested in London

Fighting the extradition request could be difficult. Experts say that European arrest warrants like the one issued by Sweden can be tough to beat, barring mental or physical incapacity. Even if the warrant were defeated on a technicality, Sweden could simply issue a new one.

Swedish lawyer Bjorn Hurtig said it was difficult to say how long the extradition process in Britain would take — anywhere from a week to two months. He said if Assange is extradited to Sweden, he won&#39;t be kept in detention after he&#39;s been questioned, &quot;because it&#39;s been for the sake of the questioning that he&#39;s been detained.&quot;

WikiLeaks, meanwhile, came under increasing financial pressure Tuesday as it became increasingly difficult to collect the individual donations that fund most of the operations of the loosely knit group of activists.

Visa Inc. said it would &quot;suspend Visa payment acceptance on WikiLeaks&#39; website pending further investigation into the nature of its business and whether it contravenes Visa operating rules.&quot; MasterCard said it would suspend payments &quot;until the situation is resolved.&quot;

PayPal Inc., a popular online payment service, has already cut its links to the website, while Swiss authorities closed Assange&#39;s new Swiss bank account on Monday, freezing tens of thousands of euros, according to his lawyers.

WikiLeaks is still soliciting donations through bank transfers to affiliates in Iceland and Germany, as well as by mail to an address at University of Melbourne in Australia.

Beginning in July, WikiLeaks angered the U.S. government by releasing tens of thousands of secret U.S. military documents on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, it began a rolling release of what WikiLeaks says are a quarter-million cables from U.S. diplomatic posts around the world. The group provided those documents to five major newspapers, which have been working with WikiLeaks to edit the cables for publication, and has been sharing subsets of the cache with other publications in recent days.

The U.S. government has launched a criminal investigation, saying the group has jeopardized U.S. national security and diplomatic efforts around the world.

As WikiLeaks has come under legal, financial and technological attack, an online army of supporters has come to its aid, sending donations, fighting off computer attacks and setting up over 500 mirror sites around the world to make sure that the secret documents are published regardless of what happens to the organization.

Hrafnsson, the WikiLeaks spokesman, said the group had no plans yet to carry through on its threat to release the key to a heavily encrypted version of some of the most sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables — an &quot;insurance&quot; file that has been distributed to supporters and news media in case of an emergency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Perhaps it will make them act better instead of the usual lying, cheating, corruption and unaccountability. If your idea of fucking up the world is well-behaved politicians then perhaps we should be moving towards a fucked up world.</p>
<p>Given that you all worship your founding fathers, perhaps these quotes will convince you.</p>
<blockquote>“No experiment can be more interesting than that we are now trying, and which we trust will end in establishing the fact, that man may be governed by reason and truth. Our first object should therefore be, to leave open to him all the avenues to truth. The most effectual hitherto found, is the freedom of the press. It is, therefore, the first shut up by those who fear the investigation of their actions.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“I am… for freedom of the press, and against all violations of the Constitution to silence by force and not by reason the complaints or criticisms, just or unjust, of our citizens against the conduct of their agents.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“[This is] a country which is afraid to read nothing, and which may be trusted with anything, so long as its reason remains unfettered by law.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>"[W]ere it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."</blockquote>

<p>In the 4 years of wikileaks releasing documents, not a single person has died due to them. The pentagon themselves confirmed it.</p>
<p>You, mwiebelhaus, are so terribly ignorant it’s unbelievable. I’m not even going to respond to that other stuff. You don’t seem to understand how democracy and accountability works. You’re nothing but a useful idiot.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Your sir are a tool and your claims are false. I never said that anybody has died from the releases but you think by pointing out that there is no deaths linked directly to Wikileak releases that nobodies life has been put in danger. You say that " not a single person has died due to them" thats not what the pentagon said. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said that no deaths can be directly tied to Wikileaks. Then an ANONYMOUS pentagon official said that there was no evidence of anyone being killed from Wikileaks releases. The truth is there will never be any evidence of anyone being killed from Wikileak releases because it will be impossible to prove it, especially in a country such as Afghanistan where people die every day and there deaths are not investigated and where deaths go unnoticed.</p>
<p>I will give you this, you have the unsurpassed ability to find liberal amounts of time to find obscure information on the internet, paraphrase this information into “facts” that fit the situation perfectly, and then write lengthy responses that end by attempting to insult which you think will throw them off. What you really accomplish is this, wasting your time arguing on the internet which I guess you think compensates for your inability to make any real world change. In short: you are a fucking fool to think sitting here reading this and formulating a lengthy insult in your head and later posting it will have any affect on me. I have posted these sentences out of humor and to clarify any misunderstandings that you have. Obviously in response you will have more bullshit information and undoubtedly another insult, but don’t worry yourself. If I read it, it will probably be whenever I feel so ridiculously bored that I feel the need to return to these forums and read so more group attacks on Frell or on anybody who talks against what the majority on this website believe.[/quote]</p>

</aside>
<p>First Amendment doesn’t protect all speech. Mainly obscenity and false advertising aren’t protected. It’s not said in the First Amendment itself, they didn’t think of it at the time of the First Amendment. It’s been decided in court cases by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Read some decisions by the Supremes on cases about Free Speech. The press doesn’t have protection under the First Amendment for information either they have obtained illegally, or have received information they knew was obtained illegally. Like journalists don’t have protection under the First Amendment to NOT speak about their sources (i.e. promising source confidentiality to their sources). States have the ability to make their own (39 states in 2009 had shield laws protecting sources), however Federal &gt; State and if a case is appealed there’s a strong chance Federal law will overturn the State law.</p>
<p>Read the case I mentioned in the last post or any other related case. Also know the law.</p>

<p>Who do the war diaries endanger other than the soldiers who have been unaccountable for crimes they have committed? Coming to think of it, I don’t even see how such soldiers would have been endangered.</p>

              <p>Thing is, the US government would have never released these documents if they were asked to nicely, or through FOI requests. Stealing them is obviously the only remaining option.<br>
I can say with certainty that anything released under FOI would have been so heavily redacted (not just names and addresses) that it would be unusable. I know this because it’s the path that the Australian government has started going down (ie, direct defiance of recent senate orders to table certain documents, and other documents that have been tabled have been heavily redacted so that they favour the government’s stance).</p>
<p>Besides, US law is irrelevant. Assange doesn’t need to rely on the first amendment, nor does he have the rights to free speech outlined in it, because he isn’t American. He isn’t subject to US law, he has no allegiance to the US, and he doesn’t answer to the US. This precludes both treason charges and espionage charges.<br>
Taken from google, just to be quick – everyone knows the meaning of the word anyway, but it underpins my argument.</p>
<blockquote>In law, treason is the crime that covers some of the more serious acts of betrayal of one's sovereign or nation</blockquote>
How can anyone even suggest treason as an appropriate charge, which is what was being thrown around a couple of days ago iirc.
<p>If he was to rob a gas station (mind you, you get your head blown off sticking up one of them) on US soil then US law would obviously apply. But to suggest that US law should apply to a non-US citizen who performed an undesirable action <em>outside</em> of the US is absurd.</p>

<p>The press has protection under the first amendment for publishing classified, but not knowingly stolen, documents.</p>
<p>There is no first amendment protection for publishing classified documents if you know they were achieved illegally, even if YOU didn’t steal them.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Assange was under the impression that these were stolen documents.</p>
