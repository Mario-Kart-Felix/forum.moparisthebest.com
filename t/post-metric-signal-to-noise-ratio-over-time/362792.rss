    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/post-metric-signal-to-noise-ratio-over-time/362792</link>
    <description>So I was just idly thinking, as I&#39;m very apt to do, about why people use reputation (or, more specifically, upvotes on reddit). My thoughts were reputation doesn&#39;t necessarily gauge a persons contribution because someone who posts 10 posts over time and gets 1 reputation per posts isn&#39;t necessarily contributing as much value as someone who makes 1 post and gets 10 reputation.

My thoughts first were just rep / post count, but I&#39;m not sure if that measurement gives any more indication than just the two metrics by themselves as it doesn&#39;t give any indication of the time span involved. But if you use the posts per day, that might work better.

For example, say person1 makes 10 posts and each post gets 1 reputation and they&#39;ve been registered for 10 days, this person has an average of 1 post per day at 10 rep - this person has an snr/t of 1  - 10 rep (signal)/10 posts (noise) * 1 post per day (time)

If person2 makes 10 posts and each post gets 1 reputation and they&#39;ve been registered for 100 days, averaging 0.1 posts per day - this person has an activity index of 0.1 - 10 rep / 10 posts * 0.1

This falls down having a rep ceiling of 200, but yeah, there&#39;s some idle thought for you. Not sure if this would work well but I enjoyed wasting about 10 minutes on it.</description>

<p>Or maybe a ‘like’ button, similar to facebook? I suppose you could track total likes per person. But this probably involves a lot of forum modifying… :S</p>
<p>There’s also <a href="http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=2234" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">post ratings</a> to consider… Maybe I’m just coming off the beaten track a bit too much though.</p>

<p>I don’t really care about the rep system, but if you want it to be representative you should base it on the current rep, how long the member is registered, and how active the member has been in the last few weeks. Members can rep++/-- someone like we can now. The rep given by members is a separate number, which is only used to calculate the actual rep number shown on a profile page.</p>
<p>It’s pretty much the same as eXemplar said, but I’ll change it a bit and make another useless post:</p>
<p>Say a member has made 1000 posts, of which 50 were made in the last 2 weeks. He has been a member for 30 weeks. He has been awarded 100 rep.</p>
<p>Let’s say that the average member makes 20 posts a week. So the member has made above average posts in the last 2 weeks, but less then his own average of 33,33 a week. So he’s 25% above the overall average, and 25% below his own. His final rep is 100*1,25=125, 125/.75= 93.75 &gt; 94.</p>
<p>Another member has made 300 posts, and has been a member for 6 weeks. In the last 2 weeks he has posted 120 posts. He has 10 rep. He’s 200% above the overall average, and 20% above his own. His rep would be 36.</p>
<p>Obviously, new members start with 0 rep, so people that come here to spam don’t look like reliable members.</p>
<p>This may sound like a stupid system, and it probably is. But it makes rep a representation of a members current activity, and how useful he is to the community at the moment. You could add a green or red arrow, a red one showing that a member is less active, or has started spewing bullshit.</p>

              <p>the only use rep holds on here/mscp anyway is as a threshold for determining cm/vet candidates, which in its own is a bad idea…<br>
other than that, there really no reason to have it other than for people to have a faux sense of a higher status among people who don’t have 200 rep (i don’t notice it on these boards, but on mscp it’s pretty rampant).</p>
<p>i think we should devise a way of candidacy for cm/vet that isn’t rep based, and get rid of rep.  lots of people won’t appreciate rep suddenly disappearing, so perhaps replacing it with some other useless information would be enough, although that could become a “problem” too (post count, for example).  regardless, it needs to go away considering its limited use and how easy it is to gain.</p>

<p>I guess those are good reasons for implementing it, but what are the longterm results from this system? Reputation is an entirely subjective system. Everyone treats it differently and considers it differently. Someone may think trivial tasks are worth reputation points, yet others may consider only long-term contributions worth awarding reputation. In such a system, how can any formula work? The underlying values are still subjective, no matter what you do with it.</p>
<p>Using this formula, you are still going to have problems. Someone who has a lot of rep but not a lot of posts will have a poor activity index. When they realize posting affects the index, they will start posting a lot of things, even if those things are completely non-contributing to the community as a whole. Post count is directly tied with membergroups, so a lot of people go after posts just as much as rep. The combination in a short amount of time results in a great activity index, based on this formula.</p>
<p>In fact, I think the only way of having a remotely accurate karma system is doing that Aura thing lothy posted about, but it’s unnecessary complex for these boards.</p>
<p>Just my thoughts.</p>

<p>The trick with this system though is that you could check who the rep givers were before applying the textual representation; if Joe Forumuser has 500 votes but those votes come from just 10 different users then you can give him a Tentative Aura title. On the flip side of the coin, if someone has 200 votes from over 100 members then you might give them a Pervasive Aura.</p>
<p>The underlying logic can be changed to whatever suits, but you can certainly stop people from climbing the ladder by having their close group of friends rep them endlessly.</p>
<p>Other than that, maybe consider a cooldown period after account creation that stops new accounts from voting.<br>
If each new account had to wait one month before being allowed to vote then most people aren’t going to see the value in cheating the system by making 100 fresh accounts to vote their one main account; a month is a long time to get caught and therefore undermines their efforts. At the same time it obviously allows them to build their own Aura up by contributing positively to the community.</p>
