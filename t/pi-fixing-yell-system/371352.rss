    <description>Alright, im back haha.
Ok i got a problem i have now commands like: 
::oyell
::myell
::dyell
::yell
::ayell
because in the past there was a problem.
When i was owner there were going 4 messages:
[Owner]
[Admin]
[Mod]
[Donator]
and
[Player]
But it&#39;s irritating me to just type the whole time: Oyell
Any thing to fix it?</description>
