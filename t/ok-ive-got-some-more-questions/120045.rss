    <description>ok well once again i have come upon some most annoying problems, and it would be wonderful if you would help.
Source: pimpscape

now if you have answers to my questions, you can post a link to a tut, or you could post here it would be greatly appreciated

1. when you use tele you get stuck real tiny and its only you that can see it, and you cant move.
2. i have gone through and for making mage require runes and levels it just doesnt not work, i have the whole thing if you dont have runes then ==false and it should send message, it might just be that im owner but even when its on new acc you can use whatever magic.
3. i need gfx for kharils crossbow, or somthing and how i change it so its not hitting only 10s and 12s at 99 range. 
4. also how do i make it so its random what comes from a theiving stall


all help is appreciated, thank you very much</description>

              <p>For the runes make sure you have <code>public boolean HasItemAmount(int itemID, int itemAmount) {
      int playerItemAmountCount = 0;
      for (int i=0; i&lt;playerItems.length; i++)
{
         if (playerItems[i] == itemID+1)
{
            playerItemAmountCount = playerItemsN[i];
}
                 if(playerItemAmountCount &gt;= itemAmount){
                    return true;}
            }
         return false;
      }</code></p>
<p>then in the spell you would put <code>if (playerHasItemAmount(####, #)) {</code><br>
and add another } to the bottem of the spell and change the #'s to the rune’s id and the second one to the amount then inside the spell you would add <code>deleteItem(####, getItemSlot(####), #);</code></p>
<p>and you would change the first and second set of #'s to the runes id and the last # to the amount</p>
