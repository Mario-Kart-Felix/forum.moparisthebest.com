    <title>[HELP] Need help damage MULTIPLIER</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-need-help-damage-multiplier/385659</link>
    <description>Hello coders.
I got this server and its not bad its a 317 with 525 graphics but the only thing wrong about it or at least only I think so is the Damage. The Damage amount that you do to Npc&#39;s &amp; Players.
This is a Project insanity and I want to know how to do PERFECT damage. willing to pay in 1-2 months, 10$. So most of you are coders for over 6 months that for sure so you guys should know how to do this and if not then your probably a bad coder. :p
So hopefully someone will take his time and tell me how to deal with this.

Many Thanks.</description>
