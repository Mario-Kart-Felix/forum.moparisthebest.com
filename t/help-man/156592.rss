<p>Introduction</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This guide will teach you how to run your own server. Im a newbie at this, so bare with me. There might be some erroes. Also please note that this is from my own mind, I used <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> to help me.</p>
<p>You will need to know:<br>
Basics of java<br>
How to download<br>
How to unzip (winRAR)<br>
If you have a router, how to port forward.<br>
2. Getting a server source</p>
<p>Now if you join a moparscape server(s), you might find some that look alike, This is because they are probably from the same server source. A server source is where you can download a completely edited server when you can edit it yourself. Starting form scratch can take you months, so i prefer getting a server soucre from <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,162478.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,162478.0.html</a>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Getting the latest JDK (Java Development Kit)</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting the latest JDK will help you to run your server. You can find a list of downloads Here<br>
Download JDK 6u1 and install it.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Getting a no-ip</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we need to get you an ip adress, what other players type in to get into your server. This step is simple really. Go to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and make an accouny. Then, once your registered, go to Hosts/Redirect and add a host. You can call it what ever you want. Then, choose creat host. If you have a router, then you must port forward for other people to join.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Running your server</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, here we go. Time to run your server. Unzip the server source you downloaded with winRAR. Now go into it and double click run server. A black screen when you run something should appear along with another screen. Your server is now running. Open up moparscape 3.2 w/ Aryan installer. Select File&gt;New Ip and type in localhost. This is what the server source looks like. You know have a working server!</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>FAQ</li>
</ol>
<p>How do I customize my server?</p>
<p>In your server source file, you should see client.java on notepad. Open that up, and you can change anytihng that is in “quotes”. Then open up client.class and put that in. This will change text that is in the orginal server source. There are other things you can change that I will not get into.</p>
<p>How do I port Forward?</p>
<p>Port Farwarding is pretty easy all you have to do is enter ure servers ip into the internet adress bar and when it comes up clikc applications and gaming and then enter moparscape as the application and enter 43594 as the start and 5555 as the end…then type in the last 3 digits of your compuetsr ip…which can be accessed like this<br>
click start &gt; run &gt; and type in command &gt; then type in “ipconfig all” without the “” and hit enter and look for computer ip adress and write down the last 3 digits then enter them in the ip adress box back on the web page and click enable and then save and your done.</p>
