    <title>I got a serious problem with my server, please take some time and read it</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-got-a-serious-problem-with-my-server-please-take-some-time-and-read-it/236182</link>
    <description>OK, I just started coding, and my server got really good after a while ( ParScape v2 based )
Then, when i portforward, let people on, 50% said shops were leeched, so i was gonna change it.
I went to shops.cfg, changed items and removed items, and i didnt remove [b]ANY[/b] spaces. I saved &amp; compiled, runned server and now nobody can log on, including me plus it say this: [IMG]http://i489.photobucket.com/albums/rr260/O0000_o_o_o0/Pleasehelp.jpg[/img]
So now I just started coding it all over again, lost like 5 pure hours of coding.  :( :confused: :eek: :( :| :confused: :mad:
