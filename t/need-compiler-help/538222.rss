    <title>Need Compiler Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-compiler-help/538222</link>
    <description>So I worked on my compilers for a while . I am new to java and looking for answers if you have questions or need me to find something please give it in simple terms in a way even a new person would know. :)

Anyways, my Client compilers is giving me the 100 errors&#39; at first I thought it was nothing after a while of research I&#39;ve seen a lot of people saying it is cause by the brackets in the codes and java just cannot read it properly.

You see I&#39;m not exactly sure if I went to the correct spot but I found this ?

As for my Source&#39;s Compiler this error comes up.

This one I&#39;m almost clue less as to how to fix it.

I cannot pay someone to help me I&#39;m really sorry . But if I can get some answers to help me so I can make my first rsps , which so far is looking pretty good &quot;been working on it with a friend.&quot; I would be very appreciative. Feel free to give harsh comments but please be willing to help if you do. I want to learn and I&#39;m ready.</description>

<p>You’re missing a bracket somewhere. I suggest starting at the first line your compiler gives the error and looking from there to find your mistake.</p>
