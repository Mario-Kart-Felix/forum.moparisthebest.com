Obviously he did MEAN THAT IT WAS PERFECT. HE SAID HE DIDN"T SEE A PROBLEM WITH IT. THAT MEANS THAT HE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS PERFECT AND DIDN’T NEED ANY CHANGE AT ALL. GO BACK AND TAKE ENGLISH AGAIN.<br>
Also, I never said that him not doing graphics means that he has no idea how to rate. I said that he would find problems and errors in more images if he had done that, rather then just giving an overall view of “No problems with it” or “It sucks”<br>
He didn’t explain why he thought there was no problems with it.</p>

<p>Shutup,you post such shit in every topic its annoying.Obviously he didn’t mean it was perfect completely that nothing could be changed.Only thing he shouldn’t have done was write a single line,and him not doing graphics does not mean he has no idea how to rate.</p>

<p>Useless post. An image/gfx/sig can never be PERFECT. there’s always gonna be problems with it. You were kinda like me when I first started posting on Images before I started doing Graphics.<br>
So before you post in the graphics section again, start making sigs and stuff and follow TuTs then come back and post.</p>

Only thing I don’t like is the plain black areas,but I know if you didn’t do that it wouldn’t make much sense then…so…</p>
<p>8/10 for me atleast.</p>

              <p>This image really conveys what you’re trying to portray.<br>
I think the center of the render is a little to bright. Maybe sharpen that up?<br>
Otherwise I think it’s ok. Just some few changes here and there to the image will make it better.</p>

              <p>I like the render, its kinda balanced between light and dark, but put swirls or something in the back, right now it looks like a girl with a aura.</p>
