    <title>[PI] Can&#39;t attack custom added NPC Rep ++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-cant-attack-custom-added-npc-rep/389430</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I put corp, and all the gwd npc in my server, some of them work (sara, bandos), but the other you can&#39;t attack at all. They will attack you if they are set to aggressive (no shit), but if you try to attack them it just won&#39;t work. 

I used the extremex source, and client which is PI, and it already had the gwd npc in it, but i added corp, and the problem occurs..

please help =[</description>

If you didn’t add them server sided they won’t work. Go into your server files, go to Data &gt; cfg &gt; npc.cfg. Open that up and put this in there:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Make sure you put a tab in between all the brackets!</p>
<p>The reason it won’t work without this is because what this is saying is there is no HP to actually hit if its not there. So when you add this its linking the NPC with the desired HP.<br>
