    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-3d-engine/244582</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently working on an RPG, and I&#39;m in need of a good 3D engine.
The must have list:

[ul][li]Support C#.net.[/li]
[li]OpenGL if possible[/li]
[li]Basic physics.[/li][/ul]</description>

              <p>Axiom is said to be somewhat dated / inactive. They chose to make a full port, so they always lag behind the real Ogre and they don’t support all features. If you can use native libraries (dlls), you might wanna use Mogre instead. A few classes are ported for efficiency, but it is mostly bindings only. Can be used from C# and the other .NET languages, and is usually relatively up to date as compared to the main Ogre version. Also, precissely because they are bindings, you have a much easier access to other ogre plugins. (Especifically, there are already a MogreNewt (Physics Library) and a MOIS (Input Library), plus some others).</p>
<p>About XNA and OpenGL, these are indeed much lower level. If you wanna learn the basics of 3D graphics, dealing with things such as transformation / projection matrices, scene managing, etc, you might wanna use one of them instead. They are harder to use though, you get good results much slower, and you need a certain math / gfx background. XNA is slightly higher level than OpenGL (Note though, that it doesn’t use it), being a somewhat “light” wrapper for DirectX, plus having quite a few other libraries.</p>

I’m tackling the RPG last on my list, but I wanted to get familiar with the engine before I went after it so this is perfect.</p>

What you could do…Use Tao.OpenGL for your classes, then you can use JOGL if you want to use Java to make a game. That way you can carry over your knowledge of OpenGL. This could also apply for Python, or any other language with an low level OpenGL binding.</p>

              <p>Never used the C# bindings, but Ogre is a very nice engine. You can go as low level with it as you need to, while still being able to just manipulate it at a high level. It’s lovely.</p>

I’m interested in this too. So ogre3d would be a good way to start with 3d graphics in C#?<br>

Depends what you want to do with 3D graphics. If you really want to learn 3d programming, you should try Tao.OpenGL or XNA. If you want to make a game and have no interest in understanding the low level workings of 3d graphics, then perhaps go with Ogre.[/quote]<br>
