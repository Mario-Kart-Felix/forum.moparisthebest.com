    <title>Need help fixing up basic clicker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-fixing-up-basic-clicker/71484</link>
    <description>K so I made two scripts for a game called Monster&amp;Me. What it does is click the fight button every 5 seconds because thats how long it takes to win a fight on average. Here is the script.

[code]program New;
begin
repeat
movemousesmooth(323,494)
clickmouse(323, 494,true)
wait(5000)
until(false)
end.[/code]

The problem is that since there is no macro detection in the game I put it on silent mouse so it can play while i surf...but after every 5 seconds the mouse goes in the top left corner...so silent mouse didint work it just moved the mouse (still clicks the fight button)

The second script-

[code]program New;
begin
ClickMouse(323, 494,true)
repeat
If GetColor(310, 236)=5395794 Then
ClickMouse(323, 494,true)
until(false)
end.[/code]

This script clicks fight and then when the (you have won this fight) sign comes it clicks fight again(so its quicker).

The problem is when there is something ontop of the game client it doesnt click...(also on silent mouse)</description>

              <p>Yeah silent mouse doesn’t work as far as I know.</p>
<p>Scar Divi should have it fixed (unless freddy is waiting to fix it for the next version after that).</p>
<p>So for now you will have to suffer with no being able to use your computer while you auto. :\</p>
