<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Server is good now they should be able to take some pics for you. For now I only have the very basic portion of the rank system added let me explain part of it here</p>
<p>I also welcome any feedback</p>
<p>-Owners are at the highest tier. They cannot be demoted in game, there are NO commands that ANY rank not even another owner can do on them. So if an owner gets hacked guess what, it won’t matter cause the<span class="bbcode-s"> other owner can get on and  ban the little you know what.</span>what I meant by this is I can remotely take down the server then just wait for other person to get on whatever communication device to further discuss.</p>
<p>-We do not have an administrator role at this time as I just don’t see a need. We may be have a contractor rank for development purposes later on if this gets large enough but I won’t even worry about that for now.</p>
<p>-Moderators are that, those who moderate. Because of this they have certain powers such as mute and ban but they can only be done to a  certain right level that is preset by myself. They cannot ban higher ranks and they are unable to ban each other. A mod should not be able to discipline another mod. IT isn’t their job but a higher staff members.</p>
<p>-Some very basic code has been made for future use with a website so moderators can also perform actions in case they are not online/same with administrators. The same power rankings are in effect here as well.</p>
<p>In other news I have completed random events so far we have</p>
<p>-sandwich lady(custom, she doesn’t do the runescape interface but instead is a “skill trivia” bot. This is my way of making sure skillers are not botting etc. Pretty much what will happen is the npc will appear at the square south of the person. From there  it cycles in the  event to  cancel that players skill variable(this way they can’t close the dialogues etc). You are then asked a skilling question. I only have one so far and it’s for testing purposes “what is the color of the bucket” the answer is brown. But there is a listing of like  three choices (red, brown, yellow). I want to also make it color blind friendly though so if you are that please let me know how I could  maybe  keep  colors friendly to you. Oh and I also forgot to mention that during this particular cycle you are unable to perform any commands (<em>cough</em> ::empty <em>cough</em> ) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
-rock golem<br>
-tree spirit<br>
-river troll<br>
-and one more but I already forgot what it was o.0</p>
<p>the combat ones are pretty much like runescape. I will probably beef up their stats a tad more than RuneScape though just to be on the safe side. I still need to write an actual defence formula sigh…</p>
<p>Other thoughts: I know a person could possibly still keep  using an auto clicker even with the sandwich lady so I am very tempted to add a skill trivia timer like where you die or something if you don’t answer it in time and you get kind of teleported at a random location I set.</p>

<p>–About 70% complete with rank/command system.  I still need to add logs etc to go along with it. Will be asking a couple of friends for some advice ina  couple of areas…<br>
-Added basic trawler minigame (administrators will need to test once I finalize a few things )<br>
-Added random events for the rock golem etc. Should keep some fun in the game. Will be challenging monsters. They won’t be weaklings :D… I am also looking for a “skiller alternative” so we don’t hurt our skiller friends feelings  &lt;3<br>
-Had to partially rewrite mining to work with rock golem<br>
-Had to fix an issue with npc clipping<br>
-Basic clue scroll system added… Credits to old rewards go to Myth-Scape source. (will of course be having administrators spamming to see what needs to be removed/what is nulled )<br>
-Puzzle Boxes should now be live but have not been fully tested.<br>
-Started on my FAVORITE minigame/hobby  back in the old days, runesquares. I can’t wait until it’s done.</p>

-fletching skill has been partially completed.<br>
–you can now make bows and bolts ( I need to research how to do darts… )<br>
–bolts include the general metal  ones and also things such as  topaz etc<br>
–all levels should be right as per taken from the wiki<br>
-started to review commands file for further investigation on how to set up a proper rank/commands system<br>
-i thought of a really cool idea for donor transportation … a magic  carpet  ride? Let  me know what you think . That or maybe  it could be a gold  sink.  Closer  teleports  with the  rugs to  bosses and donors or something  get a discount not 100% sure yet how I want it to roll.<br>
-After discussion with part of the team they want to have a lot of minigames so wer want you guys to help us think of all of the  minigames you  can  think of. Custom  or  rs  style it doesn’t matter which.<br>
-Discussion of instance dungeons was also discussed and  this has  become a  possibility. I will be  reviewing how  this  can  be doine  without  ruining the  eco. I am more than willing to take  feedback of course.</p>

<p>Some nice updates today!</p>
<p>-Semi-custom cycle event system. Some insight from a friend towards how to do this. I also leaned towards some suggestions that were given to me from when I worked on the czar project. Cycled events can now be done at random times(which I will be using with commands most likely), or as per cycled events such as skills.</p>
<p>-Clipping system has been started. I have been looking at the one that ( paladino?) released and been making some minor changes here and there and been studying up on how this can be improved. Currently taking suggestions on how it can be improved or more efficient for that matter.</p>
<p>-Basic Firemaking has been added<br>
-has animation<br>
-does different logs in games<br>
-does the different color fires<br>
-makes ashes<br>
-uses cycles<br>
-inferno adze effect<br>
-inferno adze requirement(the firemaking level)<br>
-can’t light fires in bank ( seers only at the moment was to test )</p>
