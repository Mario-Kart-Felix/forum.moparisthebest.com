<p>Or not. Seriously, follow Kyle’s advice, I don’t know why I told you to do anything but be ethical about this. It’s your brother’s private conversations and information you’re trying to get to, I don’t know about you but I really don’t like it when people look at my private stuff. Think about the decisions you’re making.</p>
