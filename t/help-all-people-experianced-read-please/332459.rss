    <description>Okay so iv&#39;e setted up a mysql and its working fine. But how do I actually get it to work via my forums.
So when they register they get registered on my forums. Because :S I cant sign in now xD and I&#39;m already registered on my forums.
Forums is a .foruml.biz site. exactly like darkbb.com

All help is valued.
