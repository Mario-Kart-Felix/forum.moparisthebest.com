I am going to show you how to fix this 

First of all make sure you have downloaded the latest version of JDK

[b]HOW TO GET Java Development Tools[/b]

http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

download the one that says java development kit (JDK)

then install it like you install anything else

[b]FIXING THE ERROR[/b]

Now go to 

C:\Programfiles\java\jdk_1_6_0_13(the numbers on the end stand for what ever version you are this is important to know your version)

next click rename on the folder and [b]copy[/b] the name of it  be exact

next go to the bat/compiler/run file that you are getting the error/errors from then right click on it and click [b]edit[/b]

then you should get a notepad open up with alotof text on it find where it says something similiar to wot you coped(the JDK version and paste your copy over the original which is there 

then click save and now your bat/compiler/run file should work successfully and other problems please ask


[b]Thanks hope this guide helped[/b]</description>
