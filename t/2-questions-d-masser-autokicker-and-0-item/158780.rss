    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-questions-d-masser-autokicker-and-0-item/158780</link>
    <description>Ok on my server ive been working on ive tried to develop a autokicker for the training...but like. the action timer no matter what it is. when you train it goes to the amount then to zero as far as i can tell. and i want it to auto kick ppl....ugh gave me a head ache.

and the second thing is i coded a thing to stop 0 iteming....but like ugh its being stupid. like i stopped melee 0 iteming but not mage. because the mage code says if cast = false &amp;&amp; actiontimer == 0 then cast = true. and im like...wtf? stupid action timers!! lolz.

so yea if you or any of my friends out there wanna help me out? :D</description>
