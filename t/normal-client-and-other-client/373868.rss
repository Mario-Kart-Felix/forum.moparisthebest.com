    <description>Well, I downloaded a 317 PI server recently, and, there was a client that came with the server that worked perfectly. And, I had another client that I wanted to try, and when I log in with the other client, every thing is in different places. The same thing happens with my webclient that I created for my server. Please help.</description>

              <p>just use the one it came with, apperently you downloaded a package, where u get server and client, so i guess that source only works right with the client it came with.</p>
