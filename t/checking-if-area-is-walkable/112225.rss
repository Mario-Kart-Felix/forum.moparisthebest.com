    <title>Checking if area is walkable</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/checking-if-area-is-walkable/112225</link>
    <description>Hello everyone.  I have another question that probably won&#39;t be answered.

Does anybody know how to make the player walk automatically in a certain direction that does a check first to see whether the area it wants to walk to is walkable (in other words, if you were to click there and you don&#39;t walk there, then return false)?

I know that question may sound complex because I am no good at explaining the situation.

I have tried the code:
[code]server.playerHandler.players[playerId].addToWalkingQueue(currentX - 1, currentY);[/code]
But that makes the player walk right through walls.  This would be okay for things like going through doorways, but it does not suffice for things like firemaking next to a wall.

Any help would be nice.  Also, don&#39;t post a solution not relevant to my topic.  I had that happen a couple times with my previous questions.
Thanks.</description>
