    <title>Worn Equipment Screen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/worn-equipment-screen/551859</link>
    <description>On my client it shows all +120 for my bonuses in my Worn Equipment interface. I have the code to write the bonuses to that interface, and I test another client which loaded them fine. I used an interface editor to make sure the IDs were the same for interface text, and they were. 

My question is why does my client output +120 no matter what in the bonuses column?</description>
