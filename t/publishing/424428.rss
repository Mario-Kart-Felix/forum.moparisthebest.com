    <description>Hey everyone, I have a few book&#39;s that I have written, one actually from when I was only 15 and I have been looking into publishing them to make a little money on the side. I don&#39;t want them to go to paper back or anything, I just want to sell them as digital downloads like for the kindle and android market. Does anyone have any information on this or have actually published something? I don&#39;t want to do anything through a third party as I don&#39;t believe they should gain a % for just submitting something that I didn&#39;t know how to. Thanks everyone.
