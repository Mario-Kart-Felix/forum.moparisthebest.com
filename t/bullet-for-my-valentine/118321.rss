[size=12pt][u][b]History:[/b][/u][/size]
Bullet For My Valentine released their first EP, Bullet For My Valentine, on November 15, 2004 through Visible Noise in the UK, and on 

November 30, 2004 in the US through Trustkill Records. A second EP, Hand of Blood, was released on August 22, 2005 through Trustkill 

Records in the US only.

A music video for the song Hand of Blood was released to promote both EPs. The song &quot;Hand of Blood,&quot; from their EP of the same 

name, landed itself onto a Trustkill compilation record entitled Trustkill Takeover. The band also released &quot;4 Words (To Choke Upon)&quot; on 

March 28, 2005. The Vinyl was limited to 1000 copies. The CD/Vinyl was deleted on day of release, therefore no new copies are 

available.

Their debut album The Poison was released in the UK on October 3, 2005. The first single from &quot;The Poison,&quot; called &quot;Suffocating Under 

Words of Sorrow (What Can I Do)&quot;, was released on September 19, 2005. Trustkill Records (the U.S. label for the band) released The 

Poison in the United States on February 14, 2006.

The song &quot;4 Words (To Choke Upon)&quot; is used in NHL &#39;06 and Madden NFL &#39;06 by EA Sports. The lyric in the bridge that goes; &quot;Pull it 

out from my back&quot; is changed to &quot;Betrayed from my back&quot;.

&quot;Hand of Blood&quot; is used in Need for Speed: Most Wanted and Burnout Revenge. In both games, the second verse is completely edited out 

due to content.

The band recently completed a headline run on the Kerrang! XXV tour at which on the final night in Brixton Academy they filmed 

footage for their new DVD. This DVD was their first release on Columbia Records.

Bullet For My Valentine have played at the Download Festival in Donington Park three years running, alongside hugely popular bands 

including Metallica, Guns N&#39; Roses, Trivium and Tool. They first appeared at Download Festival 2004, playing the Barfly stage. In 2005, 

with increased popularity, Bullet For My Valentine played on the much larger Snickers stage. By 2006, the band had been moved to near 

the top of the main stage bill, playing on the Sunday night below Guns N&#39; Roses and Funeral for a Friend.

They opened for Guns N&#39; Roses at four shows in New York City, at the Hammerstein Ballroom, on May 12th, 14th, 15th, and 17th. They 

were also the warmup band for Metallica on June 13, 2006 and opened for Iron Maiden in Boston on June 10, 2006.

Bullet For My Valentine joined Guns N’ Roses&#39; first full UK tour since 1993 as the support act, as well as Sebastian Bach, whilst also 

doing several instore signings in Birmingham, Nottingham and London.

In early 2006, Bullet For My Valentine headlined the Kerrang! Tour with Aiden, Still Remains and Hawthorne Heights supporting. Later 

that year they went on tour with Rob Zombie but they were kicked off the tour when, in an online blog, Matt Tuck complained about their 

treatment on the tour, specifically the lack of dressing rooms and the distribution of profits from T-shirt sales. During the November 2006 

tour with As I Lay Dying, Matt Tuck suffered from laryngitis which led to a number of shows being postponed until early January. They 

resumed their tour on January 3, 2007, at the Carling Academy Newcastle where they performed two of their new songs for the first 

time: &quot;Scream, Aim, &amp; Fire&quot; and &quot;Disappear&quot; as well as a cover of Metallica&#39;s Creeping Death. For most of these dates, screaming duties 

were handed over to guitarist Padge and bass player &quot;Jay&quot; James, while Matt Tuck recovered from his illness. At Manchester Apollo the 

following night, they only played one new song, &quot;Scream, Aim, &amp; Fire&quot;. During this show and the ones that followed, support band As I 

Lay Dying&#39;s vocalist joined Bullet For My Valentine onstage to sing &quot;Room 409.&quot; Bootlegs of the Manchester show can be found online; 

this is the first known recording of the song &quot;Scream, Aim, &amp; Fire&quot; as it was before the band entered the studio to record the follow-up to 

The Poison. Two songs titles have been confirmed for the new album so far. &quot;Scream, Aim and Fire&quot; is about going to war, and &quot;Waking 

The Demon&quot; is about &quot;getting revenge on a bully at school by slicing pieces off him&quot;, according to Matt Tuck, the band&#39;s front man, in an 

interview with Ultimate-Guitar.com.

The band also headlined the Kerrang! Awards in London soon after playing the Download Festival.

Matthew Tuck (frontman) has told Kerrang! magazine, &quot;We&#39;ve written eight new songs already, we&#39;re going to be recording the new 

record at the end of the year so we&#39;re just trying to get a big head start.&quot; The band will record their new album in El Paso, Texas later in 

the year.

In 2006, Bullet For My Valentine performed on the Van&#39;s Warped Tour and toured with Eighteen Visions,Avenged Sevenfold, Escape 

The Fate, and later heavy metal legends Iron Maiden. Bullet For My Valentine played at Earthday Birthday 14 on April 28, 2007 in 

Orlando, FL with bands such as Papa Roach, Nonpoint, Puddle of Mudd, and Sevendust.

Bullet For My Valentine released &quot;All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me)&quot; as a US single in the second week of January. Around 

that time, they returned to the studio to record their follow up to The Poison. According to Metal Hammer magazine all of the instrumental 

work on the new album is done, but the vocals will have to wait until BFMV finish their U.S. tour, which will continue all summer. If all 

goes as planned, they are set to release their second album in October, which was first reported as early as June. The band are said to 

have taken on a &quot;Slayer, early Metallica old - school thrash sound, coming away from the melodic romance themes&quot;.

Recently, Bullet For My Valentine have been chosen to support Metallica for two dates in their upcoming Sick Of The Studio &#39;07 tour in 

July. July 9 in Vienna, Austria, and July 8 at the recently completed Wembley Stadium in London alongside HIM and Mastodon. There 

will also be a secret gig at Islington academy in London under the name of Jeff Killed John (the band&#39;s name before it was changed to 

Bullet For My Valentine).

Bullet for my Valentine also have recorded a cover of Metallica&#39;s &#39;Creeping Death&#39; for a Kerrang CD, &#39;Higher Voltage: Another Brief 

History Of Rock&#39;, due to be released on June 20th, free with Kerrang magazine.

On 22 June 2007, it was announced that due to tonsillectomy surgery having to be brought forward, Matt would be unable to sing and the 

band was forced to cancel all Bullet For My Valentine dates, including dates supporting Metallica.

I don’t get it, are you saying it was postponed untill a later date at the apollo?<br>

Bullet For My Valentine released their first EP, Bullet For My Valentine, on November 15, 2004 through Visible Noise in the UK, and on</p>
<p>November 30, 2004 in the US through Trustkill Records. A second EP, Hand of Blood, was released on August 22, 2005 through Trustkill</p>
<p>Records in the US only.</p>
<p>A music video for the song Hand of Blood was released to promote both EPs. The song “Hand of Blood,” from their EP of the same</p>
<p>name, landed itself onto a Trustkill compilation record entitled Trustkill Takeover. The band also released “4 Words (To Choke Upon)” on</p>
<p>March 28, 2005. The Vinyl was limited to 1000 copies. The CD/Vinyl was deleted on day of release, therefore no new copies are</p>
<p>available.</p>
<p>Their debut album The Poison was released in the UK on October 3, 2005. The first single from “The Poison,” called "Suffocating Under</p>
<p>Words of Sorrow (What Can I Do)", was released on September 19, 2005. Trustkill Records (the U.S. label for the band) released The</p>
<p>Poison in the United States on February 14, 2006.</p>
<p>The song “4 Words (To Choke Upon)” is used in NHL '06 and Madden NFL '06 by EA Sports. The lyric in the bridge that goes; "Pull it</p>
<p>out from my back" is changed to “Betrayed from my back”.</p>
<p>“Hand of Blood” is used in Need for Speed: Most Wanted and Burnout Revenge. In both games, the second verse is completely edited out</p>
<p>due to content.</p>
<p>The band recently completed a headline run on the Kerrang! XXV tour at which on the final night in Brixton Academy they filmed</p>
<p>footage for their new DVD. This DVD was their first release on Columbia Records.</p>
<p>Bullet For My Valentine have played at the Download Festival in Donington Park three years running, alongside hugely popular bands</p>
<p>including Metallica, Guns N’ Roses, Trivium and Tool. They first appeared at Download Festival 2004, playing the Barfly stage. In 2005,</p>
<p>with increased popularity, Bullet For My Valentine played on the much larger Snickers stage. By 2006, the band had been moved to near</p>
<p>the top of the main stage bill, playing on the Sunday night below Guns N’ Roses and Funeral for a Friend.</p>
<p>They opened for Guns N’ Roses at four shows in New York City, at the Hammerstein Ballroom, on May 12th, 14th, 15th, and 17th. They</p>
<p>were also the warmup band for Metallica on June 13, 2006 and opened for Iron Maiden in Boston on June 10, 2006.</p>
<p>Bullet For My Valentine joined Guns N’ Roses’ first full UK tour since 1993 as the support act, as well as Sebastian Bach, whilst also</p>
<p>doing several instore signings in Birmingham, Nottingham and London.</p>
<p>In early 2006, Bullet For My Valentine headlined the Kerrang! Tour with Aiden, Still Remains and Hawthorne Heights supporting. Later</p>
<p>that year they went on tour with Rob Zombie but they were kicked off the tour when, in an online blog, Matt Tuck complained about their</p>
<p>treatment on the tour, specifically the lack of dressing rooms and the distribution of profits from T-shirt sales. During the November 2006</p>
<p>tour with As I Lay Dying, Matt Tuck suffered from laryngitis which led to a number of shows being postponed until early January. They</p>
<p>resumed their tour on January 3, 2007, at the Carling Academy Newcastle where they performed two of their new songs for the first</p>
<p>time: “Scream, Aim, &amp; Fire” and “Disappear” as well as a cover of Metallica’s Creeping Death. For most of these dates, screaming duties</p>
<p>were handed over to guitarist Padge and bass player “Jay” James, while Matt Tuck recovered from his illness. At Manchester Apollo the</p>
<p>following night, they only played one new song, “Scream, Aim, &amp; Fire”. During this show and the ones that followed, support band As I</p>
<p>Lay Dying’s vocalist joined Bullet For My Valentine onstage to sing “Room 409.” Bootlegs of the Manchester show can be found online;</p>
<p>this is the first known recording of the song “Scream, Aim, &amp; Fire” as it was before the band entered the studio to record the follow-up to</p>
<p>The Poison. Two songs titles have been confirmed for the new album so far. “Scream, Aim and Fire” is about going to war, and "Waking</p>
<p>The Demon" is about “getting revenge on a bully at school by slicing pieces off him”, according to Matt Tuck, the band’s front man, in an</p>
<p>interview with <a href="http://Ultimate-Guitar.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Ultimate-Guitar.com</a>.</p>
<p>The band also headlined the Kerrang! Awards in London soon after playing the Download Festival.</p>
<p>Matthew Tuck (frontman) has told Kerrang! magazine, "We’ve written eight new songs already, we’re going to be recording the new</p>
<p>record at the end of the year so we’re just trying to get a big head start." The band will record their new album in El Paso, Texas later in</p>
<p>the year.</p>
<p>In 2006, Bullet For My Valentine performed on the Van’s Warped Tour and toured with Eighteen Visions,Avenged Sevenfold, Escape</p>
<p>The Fate, and later heavy metal legends Iron Maiden. Bullet For My Valentine played at Earthday Birthday 14 on April 28, 2007 in</p>
<p>Orlando, FL with bands such as Papa Roach, Nonpoint, Puddle of Mudd, and Sevendust.</p>
<p>Bullet For My Valentine released “All These Things I Hate (Revolve Around Me)” as a US single in the second week of January. Around</p>
<p>that time, they returned to the studio to record their follow up to The Poison. According to Metal Hammer magazine all of the instrumental</p>
<p>work on the new album is done, but the vocals will have to wait until BFMV finish their U.S. tour, which will continue all summer. If all</p>
<p>goes as planned, they are set to release their second album in October, which was first reported as early as June. The band are said to</p>
<p>have taken on a “Slayer, early Metallica old - school thrash sound, coming away from the melodic romance themes”.</p>
<p>Recently, Bullet For My Valentine have been chosen to support Metallica for two dates in their upcoming Sick Of The Studio '07 tour in</p>
<p>July. July 9 in Vienna, Austria, and July 8 at the recently completed Wembley Stadium in London alongside HIM and Mastodon. There</p>
<p>will also be a secret gig at Islington academy in London under the name of Jeff Killed John (the band’s name before it was changed to</p>
<p>Bullet For My Valentine).</p>
<p>Bullet for my Valentine also have recorded a cover of Metallica’s ‘Creeping Death’ for a Kerrang CD, 'Higher Voltage: Another Brief</p>
<p>History Of Rock’, due to be released on June 20th, free with Kerrang magazine.</p>
<p>On 22 June 2007, it was announced that due to tonsillectomy surgery having to be brought forward, Matt would be unable to sing and the</p>
<p>band was forced to cancel all Bullet For My Valentine dates, including dates supporting Metallica.</p>
