    <description>1. The problem statement, all variables and given/known data
the rotational speed of an orbiting object is given by v= (Gm/R)^1/2where R is distance at which the object is rotating from the center of the mass distribution and M is the amount of mass within the radius R. for the distribution in a disk, the mass enclosed increases with R^2. the sun rotates in the ids of the Galaxy at distance of 8Kpc and a speed of 220km/s find the rotational speed of a star in the disk that is located at a distance of 12Kpc from the center of Galaxy.

i have no clue how to do this question. it was on my quiz but didn&#39;t know how to do. i really need help.


2. Relevant equations

the equation is given in the question.

3. The attempt at a solution

i have no clue how to start this.
i tried using v is proportional to M/R but it does not work</description>

approx. = 179.629248</p>
<p>i believe it’s something like that.</p>
<p>edit: nevermind the mass enclosed in 8 Kpc is not the same as the mass in 12 Kpc. it’s pretty much the same except you have to extrapolate for the mass of the disk for the second equation (i.e. calculate what it is expected to be at 12 Kpc given that it’s approximately 5.80248764e15 in 8 Kpc, where it increases by Δ(R^2))</p>
