    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-server-source-that-you-played-heard-ove-or-owned-backup-files-reset/169752</link>
    <description>What is the best server that you&#39;ve played, heard o&#39;ve, or owned?
Dont say go to the dl section, google it, or search it.

And backup files?  How would i make back up files everytime i change something it does that to the backup files without me doing anything?

And is it possible to make a ::reset (playername) command? if so plz post how or the command..\

THANK YOU AND HAPPY NEW YEARR!!!!!!!!!!</description>
