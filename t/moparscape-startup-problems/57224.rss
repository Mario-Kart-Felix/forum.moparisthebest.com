    <description>K, so i recently installed mopar on this comp. and when i start it up it will get to the starting up on the loading bar and then it will sit and try to load, i know it didnt freeze cause the music keeps going. then mopar will just shut down without warning. i put the cache i had to manually download on to disk and put it on this comp. i had to get it from my grandparents cause DSL is alot faster than dial-up. now it wouldnt get to the cache download before i did this and now it just does the same thing. is there a specific file i have to put the cache in or what? Thanks

:edit:

i got a pic of where my cache is and my mopar running files
