    <title>[C#] Packet networking problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-packet-networking-problems/529791</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m having a few problems with making a packet network system in C#.

When a player connects to the server, I create a new BinaryWriter for the player&#39;s stream and store this in the Player&#39;s object. I then send packets in a way such as this:
[code=csharp]writer.Write((short) 1);
writer.Write((short) 3);
writer.Flush();[/code]

I&#39;d use this to send a packet with an opcode of 1, and with a short of a value of 3. However, only the first packet flushed through the writer is received by the client. What could I be doing wrong?</description>

<p>Quick question, are you using the RS client? Or is this a side project? It’s going to be hard for anyone to find your problem without seeing the read and write(if not using the RS client) methods, by the way.</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>If I do this:</p>
<p>[code=csharp]writer.Write((short) 1);<br>
writer.Write((short) 3);<br>
writer.Flush();</p>
<p>writer.Write((short) 1);<br>
writer.Write((short) 4);<br>
writer.Flush();[/code]</p>
<p>Only the packet with the data of 3 will be received, anything after the first Flush() is not.[/quote]</p>
<p>I understand now, thanks.</p>
<p>I do not know much about (anything) in c-sharp but do you need to allocate the writer with the amount of bytes you’re about to send?</p>
