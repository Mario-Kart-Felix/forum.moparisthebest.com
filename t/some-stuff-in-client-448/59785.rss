    <description>Heres some things I found, whether or not they help at all, you decide. I&#39;m currently working on making the client connect to private servers.

Class16 - aClass71_426 = Class53_Sub14_Sub6.method697(&quot;headicons_prayer&quot;, -46);
class53_Sub14_Sub12_Sub5 - aClass71_3335 = Class53_Sub14_Sub6.method697(&quot;headicons_hint&quot;, -46);
Class63 - aClass71_1488 = Class53_Sub14_Sub6.method697(&quot;headicons_pk&quot;, -46);	
Class9 - Connecting to update server
Class16 - Welcome to RuneScape
Class17 - This is whats stopping us from connecting to the german servers if you were no invited.
Class23 - Directs it to where the cache is on your computer
Class29 - has an ::errortest command
Class34 - Unexpected server response is found in here
Class35 - Loaded sprites, So theres are pictures in the cache?
Class38 - Account locked as we suspect it has been stolen
Class39 - This computers address has been blocked
Class41 - more sprite loading?
Class42 - Jagex has a ::noclip command? lol
Class51 - They even have a ::clientdrop?
Class53_Sub9 - Unexpected loginserver response
Class53_Sub10 - &quot;Password: &quot; might help for adding an IP:
Class53_Sub10_Sub1 aClass71_2327 = Class53_Sub14_Sub6.method697(&quot;::&quot;, -46); the base for client commands? (Forgot what class it was in lol)
Class53_Sub12 - Your account has been disabled
