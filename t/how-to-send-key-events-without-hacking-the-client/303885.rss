    <title>How to send key events without hacking the client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-send-key-events-without-hacking-the-client/303885</link>
    <description>Hey I&#39;m trying to make a basic autotyper that will send text to the runescape client. I already have a loader and use reflection to hook enough so I can auto login. What I need to do now is send key events. This is turning out to be much less trivial then I thought. From what I can find in bcel bots they just write a keyboard class and use that to hook the keyevent manager in runescape.jar. What would be a good way for me to send input to the bot, without hacking the client?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 23, 2009, 12:39:18 pm[/size][hr]Wait I think I was being a noob... I can just use reflection to invoke those methods... silly me.</description>

<p>It would be nice to see a full bot made out of it, but I’ve come to the conclusion that if it is going to be done I will be the one doing it, no big deal. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>At my school I can just change my Mac address and get assigned a new ip address. Also I play my main from a laptop with a seperate IP then I run all my ad bots on. So even if I get ip banned no big deal, I just have to run tut island solver a lot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>Sorry to inform you but your local IP has nothing to do with your external IP seen by jagex. Yes you will be able to get a new local IP, but I highly doubt your schools router handles multiple external IPs. It is not needed in a school and therefor it is not needed to pay for it either.[/quote]<br>
No we get public ip addresses. Each computer on our network has its own public ip address. Most colleges have a whole block like we have all of 144.118 or something.<br>
And my only goal is to get people in my clan Idk how many accounts get banned in the process <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>And bash I think I meant to quote from here: (which makes what i said relevant)<br>

How is this remotely relevant? I’m talking about how to prevent a bot from being detected. Not taking the boneheaded route and carrying on regardless.</p>

It uses significantly less for me, something to do with java+ xubuntu + the opensource api driver failage. Like drawing to screen uses 90% of a dual core 2.0, If I change the client delay to 1 second it cuts down to about 5% usage.

A delay of 1sec? Thats insane. 1 FPS is terrible for a client and you should be banned very quickly.</p>

At my school I can just change my Mac address and get assigned a new ip address. Also I play my main from a laptop with a seperate IP then I run all my ad bots on. So even if I get ip banned no big deal, I just have to run tut island solver a lot <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

It really doesn’t use a lot less cpu. The reason why it uses so much cpu isn’t just because the final 2d image is being drawn on the screen, but because of the tens of thousands of calculations done hundreds of times per second.<br>

<p>just dispatch the event from the Canvas , example:</p>
<p><code>	public  static void pressBackSpace(int sleep)
	{
		char c = KeyEvent.VK_BACK_SPACE;
		int code = (int)c;
		getCanvas().dispatchEvent(new KeyEvent(getCanvas(), KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED, System.currentTimeMillis(), 0, code, c, KeyEvent.KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD));
		getCanvas().dispatchEvent(new KeyEvent(getCanvas(), KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED, System.currentTimeMillis() + sleep, 0, code, c, KeyEvent.KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD));
	}</code><br>
^some part of the Keyboard event dispatcher from Armsbot (my bot)</p>
<p>Edit: note: if you don’t know how to get the canvas, you just cast the inner component at 1,1 of the applet:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public Canvas getCanvas(){
return (Canvas)getApplet().getComponent(0).getComponentAt(1,1);
}</code></pre>

What I need to do now is send key events. This is turning out to be much less trivial then I thought. From what I can find in bcel bots they just write a keyboard class and use that to hook the keyevent manager in runescape.jar. What would be a good way for me to send input to the bot, without hacking the client?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 23, 2009, 12:39:18 pm[/size][hr]Wait I think I was being a noob… I can just use reflection to invoke those methods… silly me.<br>

just dispatch the event from the Canvas , example:</p>
<p><code>	public  static void pressBackSpace(int sleep)
	{
		char c = KeyEvent.VK_BACK_SPACE;
		int code = (int)c;
		getCanvas().dispatchEvent(new KeyEvent(getCanvas(), KeyEvent.KEY_PRESSED, System.currentTimeMillis(), 0, code, c, KeyEvent.KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD));
		getCanvas().dispatchEvent(new KeyEvent(getCanvas(), KeyEvent.KEY_RELEASED, System.currentTimeMillis() + sleep, 0, code, c, KeyEvent.KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD));
	}</code><br>
^some part of the Keyboard event dispatcher from Armsbot (my bot)</p>
<p>Edit: note: if you don’t know how to get the canvas, you just cast the inner component at 1,1 of the applet:</p>
<p><code>
public Canvas getCanvas(){
return (Canvas)getApplet().getComponent(0).getComponentAt(1,1);
}
</code>[/quote]<br>

<p>That’s why you disable the full render cycle and not just the dump at the end, surely?</p>

              <p>It uses significantly less for me, something to do with java+ xubuntu + the opensource api driver failage. Like drawing to screen uses 90% of a dual core 2.0, If I change the client delay to 1 second it cuts down to about 5% usage. I assume not showing the client at all would be even better[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 23, 2009, 10:07:15 pm[/size][hr]Now that I think about it thats probably a bad assumption. Probably adding the delay to the paint method is what is freeing up so much cpu. If the client was hidden it would probably go back to using 90% of my cpu</p>

<p>How far along is this bot? Not to go off topic of course…[/quote]<br>
it is a fully functional advanced reflection based bot, its all done, but i am working on the updater since it got screwed by the runetek update, it wont take much time. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
