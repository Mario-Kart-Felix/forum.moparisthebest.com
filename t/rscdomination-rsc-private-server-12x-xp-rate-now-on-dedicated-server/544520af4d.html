<p>The only “evidence” which isn’t actually evidence comes from a butthurt little bitch who got banned for being a massive troll once he got demoted from the team… which might I add, was his own choice.</p>
<p>Just a quick FYI, Bantard is no coder… neither is Liam. Evidently this was proved numerous times with the fail attempts at updating. This is the best entertainment since top of the pops.</p>

        <p>Lol, try me bro. Look at you - you’re an admin and you’re threatening to hack peoples computers LOL. You’re so mad because RSCD failed, which actually is quite funny considering the time before this when it died, you fucked off and left the others to pick up the pieces, then as soon as people started putting hard work in - we got the server going, then you decide to show your face again. You suck the air out of Gil’s bum hole 24/7, you were blind to what was going on around you. Too caught up in a power trip to care. You’re certainly a character mate, I wish you all the very best - it’s been a right good laugh.</p>

<p>^ HAHAHA!! The only time Liam and code® can be used in a sentance is if you say “liam can’t code”. Oh elliot you make me lol  :palm:</p>

<p>Says the guy who can’t even make a valid XML document…</p>
<p>Let me make this clear - I did not ‘sabotage’ the site. Even if I did want to sabotage the project I’d have done an awful lot more than put the forum in maintenance and put the maintenance message as a pathetic sentence with poor grammar. I’d have ripped this shit apart completely. EDIT - I’ve just realised the ‘sabotage’ message was on the old site which I was banned from, so it couldn’t have been me :rolleyes:</p>
<p>I was the coder on this server and I made it clear from the start that I was new to Java and would pick it up as I went along, so not to expect anything special. I specialise in web development, not Java development. I’ve got 8 years experience in this field and it is my full time job - I’m currently developing web applications for a multi-million organisation (British Airways) using AngularJS, node.js etc etc… But yeah - I can’t code for shit. :palm:</p>
<p>I made no false promises about how long it would take me to do updates, yet I still managed to do more in the 3-4 weeks I was here than was managed in the supposed 2 years this piece of shit was put together. I said from the start that the source was shit too. It’s buggy as hell and the server/client/loginserver sources were mixed up entirely. I spent a couple of hours one night splitting the sources correctly - a simple task none of you could manage yourselves.</p>
<p>This project was always going to fail with the staff team it had, and I didn’t have the spare time to churn out updates as the only coder on the team. I have a wife, two kids, a full time job, and other side projects on the go… I’m not a fudgeing machine.</p>
<p>My first update to the project did fail. Perhaps that was because the organisation from staff and the project itself was piss poor. There only 32987567981678962 folders on the server desktop, each labelled ‘DOMP2P’, ‘Dominationp2p’, ‘Domp2p latest’, ‘domp2pnew’, ‘domp2pnewest’, yet I was somehow instinctively meant to know which were the right ones to update. And when I finally managed to solve this puzzle the staff decided to roll back while I was trying to fix the issue further confusing the situation.</p>
<p>Then along came the dedicated server - which players had happily donated $200+ to pay for. None of the team could even manage to set it up on the dedicated server so I kindly offered to do it for them and it was set up and ready to go within an hour… I’m sorry to burst the bubble of anyone who donated - but this project is a failure and your money is dead in the water.</p>
<p>Some of the staff on this project are a complete and utter failure. This project is therefore a complete and utter failure which is why I decided to drop out yesterday. I left on a good note though - I even offered to help with little things in the future if they needed it (which they fudgeing would). Oh how I regret that now. Conveniently someone has ‘sabotaged’ the forum (my guess is Daz - since I was banned from the forum…) while I was asleep. Fan-fudgeing-tastic.</p>
<p>I love how they have called this ‘sabotage’ too. Putting a forum into maintenance mode with a pathetic message is not sabotage. If I were to ‘sabotage’ the project I would have screwed it sideways then shoved it down a black hole of nothingness. Then again - it was nothing to do with me - but I’m loving the tornado of hatred you guys are throwing back in my face.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to see just how awful the source really is - I’ve open sourced it here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-iz8VOcOACBZGRJUkVYUl9sTzA/edit?usp=sharing" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-iz8VOcOACBZGRJUkVYUl9sTzA/edit?usp=sharing</a>. Hopefully someone can make a server out of this and lead it better than this staff team could ever manage.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

<p>The only ‘funny’ thing here Elliot, is the fact you have to hide who you are by creating a new mopar account. haha! Secondly, the only reason I wasn’t around for a while was due to having no computer (which the team knew). Not that this had anything to do with you, power trip you say? bitch please…<br>
You used to be cool… you chose to leave and ever since that moment you’ve acted like the little school girl you are. Say what you like kid, you were only ever a means to get players to the other staff, if I’d have had a computer at the time of my absence… you wouldn’t have even been around other than to lick arse to get a crown.</p>
<p>You’re right about one thing though… it has been a right good laugh. Watching the maturity level of 3 people I had high opinions of, slowly diminish over such a short period of time. Typical rsc downy’s time and time again.</p>
<p>Hey I almost forgot, remember that Skype conversation Elliot when you were “crying your eyes out” cause mommy was mad at you…Just re-read it… man up little boy, man up. You still getting grief of the old lady cause she still has to spoon feed her 20 year old little kid who can’t stand on his own 2 feet?? Stop selling drugs and get out in the real world and find a job you little scrubber.</p>

<p>You’re the only staff at RSC Domination who could/would have put the message on the old forum and you come on here spouting bullshit about how I can’t code, and blame me for causing the mess. You can’t even put together a parseable XML document, your spelling and grammar is atrocious, and you fucked this all up.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s just coincidence that you happened to tell me “I’m only sticking around out of loyalty, I’m busy playing the RSCR beta” then that night a maintenance message appears on a forum <span class="bbcode-b">I’m banned from</span> saying “Play a better server like RSCR”. :palm:</p>

        <p>HAHA WTF ^^^^^ I made one XML error, a space too many… big effing deal!</p>
<p>And so what if I play RSCR, Just because I’m staff on one server doesn’t mean I can’t play another. You were the one who claimed to be a hot shot. I have never claimed I can code. I can dabble with XML’s. I don’t pretend to be something I’m not. Shea was the one who sabotaged the forum.</p>
<p>Why I’d do it when I’m still loyal to RSCD is beyond my comprehension you tool…</p>
<p>The worst part is, you blame me for something you know damn well you’re irl bum buddy did. I bet you Shea and Elliot all sat and conspired the whole thing.</p>
<p>No wonder RSC community has turned to utter shit the past few years. With the exception of a handful of players, the majority are just completed dicks. My spelling and grammar are just fine thanks, you’re heads too far up your own arse you’re an amateur coder and this was proved with the stuff you claimed was “easy” yet the bugs were completely epic in your work.</p>
<p>Go back to whatever the hell it is you do irl and don’t even bother dedicating the whole 30mins per night to another server. If anyone has any brain cells about them they’d give you a wide birth before asking for your help on a server.</p>
<p>I’m done. Said all I have to say, I’ll sit back and watch the shit dribble out of your mouth as you 3 sit and argue with yourselves.</p>

        <p>[quote=“inspectah, post:94, topic:544520”]HAHA WTF ^^^^^ I made one XML error, a space too many… big effing deal!</p>
<p>And so what if I play RSCR, Just because I’m staff on one server doesn’t mean I can’t play another. You were the one who claimed to be a hot shot. I have never claimed I can code. I can dabble with XML’s. I don’t pretend to be something I’m not. Shea was the one who sabotaged the forum.</p>
<p>Why I’d do it when I’m still loyal to RSCD is beyond my comprehension you tool…</p>
<p>The worst part is, you blame me for something you know damn well you’re irl bum buddy did. I bet you Shea and Elliot all sat and conspired the whole thing.</p>
<p>No wonder RSC community has turned to utter shit the past few years. With the exception of a handful of players, the majority are just completed dicks. My spelling and grammar are just fine thanks, you’re heads too far up your own arse you’re an amateur coder and this was proved with the stuff you claimed was “easy” yet the bugs were completely epic in your work.</p>
<p>Go back to whatever the hell it is you do irl and don’t even bother dedicating the whole 30mins per night to another server. If anyone has any brain cells about them they’d give you a wide birth before asking for your help on a server.</p>
<p>I’m done. Said all I have to say, I’ll sit back and watch the shit dribble out of your mouth as you 3 sit and argue with yourselves.</p>
<p>Liam Potter, Shea, Elliot Jones - You’re mothers shoulda swallowed you. [/quote]</p>
<p>Let me clear one thing up first of all. Ever directly or indirectly mention my mother again, and I will drive to wherever the fuck it is you live and beat the shit out of you.</p>
<p>Now that is out of the way, I never sabotaged the forums with a shitty maintenance message. I wasn’t even at home in front of the laptop. The first I knew of it was when Elliot showed me the screenshot and asked if I knew anything about it. I did however write the post using Gil’s account disclosing his and seemz password, that was my only input into that.<br>
Provide evidence of anything else, bar what I said I done or shut the fuck up. It’s amusing how you act over a private server with no players.</p>
