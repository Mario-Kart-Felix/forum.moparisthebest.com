    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/god-damn-photoshop-i-need-help/294432</link>
    <description>Man this is stupid, im on my way to design a website for a client and run into this wierd problem that will not go away even when i close and reload it. I finally got photoshop permenantly and its still acting funny wtf :mad:.

I can&#39;t use any tool on photoshop, all i get is a fat ass hand that doesnt change when on the image canvas. Anyone know how to get rid of this? I cant screeny it because the pointer, thats a hand in photoshop, it wont show up  :mad:</description>
