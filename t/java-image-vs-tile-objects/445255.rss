    <title>[Java] Image vs Tile objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-image-vs-tile-objects/445255</link>
    <description>The way I have my tile base game now is that it loads the tiles from a sheet and draws them based off of a map file. I want to implement a form of auto tile placement for my editor, which will require an additional 4 bits. I was thinking that instead of using images, I could make a tile object that contains the image and 5 bits. 4 bits for the auto tile placement for the editor and the other bit for collision detection. I just want to know if that is gonna take a lot more memory than I need to be using. If you can think of a better way to do things then by all means tell me.</description>
