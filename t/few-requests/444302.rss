    <description>I&#39;m looking for a couple images, One I would like to be the size of the avatars on any SMF forum, like here Java guru, Lisp guru, Moderator etc. This one though I would like to be &quot;Tech guru&quot; with a nerdy look cartoon or a laptop (Something that would correspond with tech work, just be creative :P) and the other I would like the size of the stars on here, but something tech related aswell, like a little wrench or something. I&#39;m not creative at all so I need some help.. If you have any other images you think would be good feel free to make them :P They also need to be transparent.</description>
