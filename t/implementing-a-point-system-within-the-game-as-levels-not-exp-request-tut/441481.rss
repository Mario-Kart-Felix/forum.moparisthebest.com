<p>For someone of his skill level I’d say it’s a brilliant place to start, I can’t see him doing more than a quick scan read of any text-based tutorial but Bucky’s video tutorials keep you interested and will actually teach you the basics. It’s then up to him to go in whatever direction he wants but this will teach him enough to do what he originally started this thread for IMO.[/quote]<br>
No.  Everything than can be wrong, is done wrong in his videos.  He’ll end up creating a bigger mess of crap, and struggle than it will ever be worth.</p>

I wasn’t serious, but I did actually learn from doing things, and reading java’s api.</p>
<p>It’s slow way of learning, but at least you learn it well. I can tell you that if you read a book entirely through, you have no idea what to do, for weeks. The best way to learn it and master it, is to read books one chapter at time, and practice what you’ve learnt.</p>
<p>It’s kinda the same with car driving school. You learn everything in theory, and bit by doing things, but it just takes loads of pratcice to get better, and when you get the driving license, it doesn’t prove jackshit about your driving skills, it only means that you’ve passed the test(s) and you know the basics.</p>

<p>For someone of his skill level I’d say it’s a brilliant place to start, I can’t see him doing more than a quick scan read of any text-based tutorial but Bucky’s video tutorials keep you interested and will actually teach you the basics. It’s then up to him to go in whatever direction he wants but this will teach him enough to do what he originally started this thread for IMO.</p>

Lol. Your advice is almost the worst possible if you’re being serious.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>,<br>
If you’re aiming to actually launch a server, you’re in way over your head - just pay someone to do this for you. If you’re just doing this to learn, then learn java first - you will have an easier time understanding the code. Even then, you won’t have a good understanding of the server without digging through it. If you’re doing this just to mess around with some buddies or whatever, then look for something that’s most suitable for your needs and again, either pay someone to adapt it to what you want or find someone willing to help you personally.[/quote]</p>

              <p>You could always look at PeeKay, it’s my old server with point system and clientsided UI to change stats.<br>
It’s pretty basic to make a point system, just store the points in Player class, then go to FightEvent and replace the experience add with points(affectedPlayer.points += amount). Then make saving for the points, it’s harder on LoginServer/GameServer set up, if you don’t have any experience. So with divine pk it should be pretty simple…</p>
<p>Search for PeeKay on development section, It has everything you will need, and more.</p>
