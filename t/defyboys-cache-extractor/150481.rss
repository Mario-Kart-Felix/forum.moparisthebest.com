    <description>Hey everyone  :|


** I also posted this in the Questions section, no one replied though.. **


i&#39;m having trouble getting a .mdl file, all the things i have are .dat, i thought it was something to do with defyboys cache extractor..  :o


but for some weird reason i can&#39;t seem to get it, so if someone could waste 1 minute of there time uploading it for me, i would be forever grateful.


(you may or may not be wondering why i want a .mdl file, well, it&#39;s so i can use Gzip to turn it into a .gz file so then i can add it to my client)


(you may also be wondering how i got the .dat models, well it was quite simple actually, i just downloaded that runescape model viewer by bentski and then clicked on the run.bat thing. then i waited about 1 or 2 hours for the 40k .dat files to be placed on my comp.)


thanks in advance.  :cool:</description>
