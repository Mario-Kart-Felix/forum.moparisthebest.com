At Divine Reality we believe in the old saying &quot;The customer is always right&quot; The players being the customers. We actually take note of what our players are doing and saying, we actually look and reply to ALL suggestions.

If you&#39;re like us you&#39;re sick of joining an rsps only to be another &quot;Sheep in the flock&quot; or to find out that the owner just doesn&#39;t care.
At Divine Reality we are passionate gamers, we believe a game should be played for fun and therefore we are always thinking of new ideas and content and running it past the community to see their thoughts.
We have an excellent staff team that are there for the PLAYERS and will help in anyway they possibly can.

We also have logs on almost everything so if a player loses an item when they shouldn&#39;t have they can be refunded without the risk of players cheating the system.

We have many features at Divine Reality such as:

    Projectile clipping.
    Npc clipping both in and out of combat.
    Player clipping.
    Obfuscated client to prevent cheat clients.
    Anti pk point farming system that still allows legit pkers to get points.
    Fully working clanchat with ranks and commands.
    Firecape animation.
    Decent drop rates, so your drops are worthwhile.
    Hard, medium and easy bosses.
    No overpowered weapons in the donation store. We are not a &quot;pay to win&quot; server.
    Bank pins.
    Sir, Lord and Legend game modes. Each with their own benefits.
    Skill points shop.
    Pure shop.
    Pking shop, both supply&#39;s and rewards.


Bosses:

    Fully working GWD with minions and killcount.
    King black dragon.
    Barrelchest.
    Kalphite Queen.
    Daggonoth kings.
    Giant moles.
    Glod. (Requires a team to kill and a minigame to enter)
    Slash bash.
    Ape atoll dungeon.
    Brimhaven dungeon.


Fully working skills:

    Runecrafting.
    Agility with multiple courses.
    Herblore with profit to be made.
    Theiving with rouges den and point shop.
    Fully working crafting.
    Fully working fletching.
    Fully working slayer.
    Mining with guild.
    Smithing.
    Fishing with guild.
    Cooking.
    Firemaking.
    Woodcutting.
    Farming with multiple patches and money to be made (Herblore).
    Hunter coming soon.
