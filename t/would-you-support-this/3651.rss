    <title>Would you support this?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-you-support-this/3651</link>
    <description>I had the idea to suggest a new area of the wildy where it was like the old rsc pking area except transfered into rs2. By rsc pking i meen with the 3 hit rule, and 2 square catching. It might sound like a long shot but if i make a post on rs forums and get thousands of ppl to agree with me, they might take it into consideration. I was just wondering if you guys think its a good idea or not, and also if you think i would get a lot of support. Please respond  :rolleyes:</description>

              <p>Frank, I don’t think they "killed’ pking, its still fun with a clan. But solo pking is pretty much impossible now. This is a good idea, but Jagex wants to keep RSC and RS2 seperate… they won’t do this.</p>

<p>I was thinkin that there would be a fence separating the two zones, with a warning message before the rsc zone. But judging by the feedback on other site it seems like my idea will never be taken seriuosly.</p>
