    <title>Adding make over mage?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-make-over-mage/341352</link>
    <description>Hello moparscapians! I have been trying to prep my server to go online when I realize that my server doesn&#39;t have the make over mage (you think i would have though about this first but yah lol) I have the npc for the make over mage but when I go to him and it opens up the screen to edit your character non of the buttons do anything. I edited an account to tell me the action buttons they use but it doesn&#39;t tell me so im assuming that it doesn&#39;t have any. Any help would be great.

I thought about this for a while to see if there was a way I could get the action classes for the buttons myself because i know that this is coded in because it shows that it is in the cache by the upper left. I would love any help from the moparscape I have come to know and love. Feel better soon deathschaos9!


Update: I found out that the interface id is 3559</description>

              <p>Do you think my players would be happy with a random character generator? I set it up so that if you do ::male it gives you a male with random clothes and hair + color and ect… and the same for female. Think they will be ok with this?</p>

              <p>u edited a packet in your client, causing it to show the character wearing armor for that interface, instead of having it in a different packet being called only by the equipment interface</p>
<p>your better off just not having it, its rarely used + more work then its worth</p>
