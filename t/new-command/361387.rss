              <p>I haven’t tested this in my compiler, so it might not work, but you have to go into the client and make a little boxed area “walls” or something else that is a barrier to contain the players from getting out, and just edit the command that is already there so that you don’t have to go and right it through out the whole Client file, and then add a mute command to it, and for the unjail, just make it so that it unmutes, but i’ll write one of those out when your done testing this.</p>
<p>Command:<br>
if(command.startsWith(“jail”) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3) {<br>
