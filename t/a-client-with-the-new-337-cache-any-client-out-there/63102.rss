    <title>A client with the new 337 cache?Any client out there?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-client-with-the-new-337-cache-any-client-out-there/63102</link>
    <description>Hi,
I Know a lot about server sources etc. cause i like hosting rs servers, but since i am making a website for the now so popular server, i need some more features such as a web client or a client that matches to the name of the server(berlinscape). But i have no clue about the clients etc...Since there ist no thread about what the new cache does and is, i need to open a help thread! SO....the only thing i know about is that the new cache has new graphics and npcs items, etc....but what is so good about. I mean if it were so awesome like the real rs is now...then mopar would have updated the so good MOPARSCAPE CLIENT with ayran and other stuff...but what the, it isnt! So Can someone give me some explanations of this client stuff and maybe tell me a good client that uses the newest cache? PLease guys, i know i could search through the forums for another half year, (like i did with finding out about server source and java) but i really need someones help now. Any link to another thread that answers my questions would already be APPRECIATED GREATLLLLYY! So, please please post 
THANKS SO MUCH!</description>

<p>Using the new content isn’t a matter of just updating the client to use the new cache. The cache format has changed, as has the entire network protocol. A complete rewrite of the server is needed, unfortunately.</p>

<p>well somethings can be updated just by changing the reading of the cache.</p>
