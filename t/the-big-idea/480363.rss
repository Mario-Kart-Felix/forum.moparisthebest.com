    <title>The Big Idea</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-big-idea/480363</link>
    <description>This year has been one of the most controversial years in RuneScape history, and it isn&#39;t exactly considered &#39;great&#39; either. There have been tons of feedback from people that have been giving negative comments about the Evolution of Combat. The game has changed a great bit when being compared from years ago, but it has also changed a lot since the past year. People need to focus on the idea that RuneScape will never go back down the same path they have so long walked from, simply because it is not an option. You cannot and bring back the past, because those things happened due to a set of certain actions, which will never occur in the same exact manner again. There is no way we can possibly know what the future of RuneScape is, but it will not be a link to the past. 

My point is that many people loved RS2, whether the reason remains to be nostalgia or pure dedication and desire; however, there is no way we can reverse the course of actions that are now the past. No one is completely happy with the new RuneScape, but it is the future of the game itself, so we need to either embrace it or move on. Everything in this world changes, even if it isn&#39;t for the better of everyone.</description>

I actually disagree, I am not happy with the new updates, you are not happy with the new updates, but their are people that completely love the new combat system.[/quote]<br>
I never said I wasn’t happy with the system, as I really enjoy it; however, it takes a vast amount of adjustment to get used to the game in its new stage. Also, I highly doubt there is someone that is <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">completely</span></span> happy with everything in these new updates.</p>

What actually happens is, you grow up and you get sick of playing the same thing even if it gets updates. I personally started logging in less these days not because of the updates, but because I just seem to have grown out of this game now. Wouldn't play a 2005/2006 version either, those were just happy childhood memories.
