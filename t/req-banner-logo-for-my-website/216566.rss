    <title>[Req] Banner/logo for my website</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-banner-logo-for-my-website/216566</link>
    <description>Hey people Mupescape here  :D
I&#39;m going to be as descriptive as possible with this post but I&#39;m wondering if someone will help me make a Banner/Logo for my website,my last thread I was wasn&#39;t completely explaind enough.

[b]Words for logo:[/b] &quot;Runescape Quest Helping&quot; (No quotes).

[b]Font:[/b]
[IMG]http://i180.photobucket.com/albums/x303/mystickid2k6/TEXT-1.png[/img]
[b]EDIT:[/b] The maker of this font (Granpy - Piczo website codes) told me it was impact but with drop shadow and I forgot what else..Although I have nothing to make this I&#39;de appreciate it if someone could help me make this.
[b]Theme:[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;I want a banner for a RS tips site.  A logo with some dragon armor or loads of cash would be nice.  Something that conveys wealth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Something like that but... With Runescape armour not really sure any fancy kind of armour, some cash and like a Quest symbol to the side, you see my website is going to be a QuestHelping website if you already haven&#39;t know.
[b]Image Colour:[/b]
Same colour as the text in the font I&#39;ve shown above &quot;Navtiation&quot; one but I want only text to be that color, and for the items, cash and quest symbol, I want it to be kind of blurred/transparent and also a black background will be fine :).
[b]Image texture:[/b]
None, nothing special.

[b]Image size:[/b]
456 x 189

Hope this wouldn&#39;t be to much work..
I&#39;ll accept any kind of work as long as its sweet looking :D Please, tell me if I&#39;m not describing it well enough because I can edit this to try and make it more clearly.
Sincerly,
        Mupescape.</description>
