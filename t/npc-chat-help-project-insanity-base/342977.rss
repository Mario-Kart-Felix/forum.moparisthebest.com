    <title>NPC Chat Help (Project Insanity Base)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-chat-help-project-insanity-base/342977</link>
    <description>Hello, I am using a Project Insanity based server. I am just now coding in some new dialogue for my npc&#39;s. I have gotten 21 out of my 23 to work so far. the last 2 dont seem to work. (For this you have to go into the DialogueHandler.java) I have it set up like it should be... i think.

Here are those 2 codes:
[code]		case 22:
			sendNpcChat4(&quot;You have already gotten a Partyhat!&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;King Lathas&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 0;
		break;
		case 23:
			sendNpcChat4(&quot;Sorry, the Skillcape Shop is down for now...&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;Wise Old Man&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 0;
		break;[/code]
Now, 0 makes the chat go back to the normal public chatbox.
When i try to compile it comes up with errors for those 2. It says that they could not be applied... but when i set them up like this:
[code]		case 22:
			sendStatement(&quot;You have already gotten a Partyhat!&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 0;
		break;
		case 23:
			sendStatement(&quot;Sorry, the Skillcape Shop is down for now...&quot;);
			c.nextChat = 0;
		break;[/code]
They work great, but the Npc&#39;s head doesn&#39;t show. That is why I do not like using sendStatement.

Thanks for the help!
