<p>[b]no it seems to be the eventmanager?? and maybe a restart built into the server but i cant see it in the run<br>
and the cmd and control panel does restart after about 3hours but no idea how to fix this<br>
the server is very laggy and not 100% stable so maybe i could update or get some help with this??</p>

              <p>maby you have an auto re starter. i know some servers have it built in. Like rogers advanced scape.</p>
