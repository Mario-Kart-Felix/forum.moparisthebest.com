    <description>I am trying to find a way to make an anti-dupe.
People can trade and then accept, and then after trade is finished, the person who originally had the stuff, logs out and then back in and then they both have the stuff....

Example:
Person A has 1 godsword
Person B offers nothing
They have trade, and then after trade is all finished.
Person A xlogs
They both have the godsword.

Please help, maybe putting a timer to like 10 seconds before they can log out after trade.
Or save their game immediately after accept..

PLEASE HELP!</description>
