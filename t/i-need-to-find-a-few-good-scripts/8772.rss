    <title>I need to find a few good scripts</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-to-find-a-few-good-scripts/8772</link>
    <description>hello everyone, 

i am new to the moparscape forums but i am starting to like it here already. It seems like a very nice and well mannered community and i would like to congratulate the founder/developer or this site and his/her staff for making such a good place. I am an administrator on a runescape cheating site, i will not advertise it because im not sure of the advertising rules in these forums (play it safe). but anyways, im here because i am looking for a few good scripts that work very well. i have already downloaded (overwritten) all of the includes in scar by opening the file menu then doing so.

so im pretty sure that i am good as far as includes go, what i need to know is do i have to maually put these includes into the scripts? or do the automatically work when i upload a script into scar to run it.

also, here are a few scripts that i need, i only want scripts that work well, i have wasted way to much time on scripts that do not work and they just wind up frustrating me. If i have to pay for a decent script then that is fine by me, i just need to get the money together.  i need the following scripts:

air rune crafter
willow cutter and banker
autominer and banker
also, any other rune crafter scripts that work well  :)

also... if you have any other very well working scripts that you would like to talk to me about then i am always open for discussion. you can contact me at ltownsamurai@hotmai.com  :cool:

one more thing, i know i look like a n33b for asking this but, whats SRL? lmao thanks

thank you for your time.

<p>just about as far as the tutorial goes that i read on this site, lol.</p>
<p>so, hopefully that will be enough  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

Includes, if the script says it needs an include and you have that in your includes folder, you should be alright.<br>
SRL is a giant include that pretty much covers everything you need, but is downloaded seperately, you can find the download somewhere on this forum.<br>
As for the scripts, since most of the scripts in the scar runescape scripts section are either out of date or not working, you<br>
could apply to get into the srl scripts section which has many good, working scripts, but you have to have basic knowledge of scripting to get into it.</p>
