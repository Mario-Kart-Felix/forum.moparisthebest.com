    <title>Runecraft ~ SOON TO BE 24/7</title>

    <description>[center]Hey people :)

I love Minecraft, and I have decided to setup my own server. I have a Linux VPS and I will host it 24/7 as soon as possible! (My cousin owns the VPS company, and I recently installed some new shit and made it crash, so he has to come back from vacation and fix it for me xD)

Anyways, the server will be 24/7 so you will ALL be able to play (Even you with cracked clients! :) ) and it will be the same as in singleplayer, everyone will be allowed to do everything, and the only thing restricted at the moment is PvP.

The server is currently hosted on my computer, with a max amount of players set to 10. This is for people to try it out and hopefully advertise a little. The server will hopefully be 24/7 no lagg tonight or tomorrow.

Thanks for reading :)
