    <description>Anybody know how to fix this? It&#39;s from running the Webclient.

[img]http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/9052/helpcy.png[/img]

I tried re-doing it over and over, including deleting all the class files and compiling, however this Error won&#39;t go away.. Any ideas as to why this is happening?

Also, when I Jar&#39;d my client why does another name of a client comes up even though I changed everything?</description>

<p>If it’s creating a client.jar.jar file, Change where it says “Signed JAR file” from “client.jar” to just “client”</p>
<p>This is my problem: <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/97996038/Untitled.png" alt width="" height=""></p>

              <p>Wrong Section BTW  :eek: sorry that this is so long but I hope it helps</p>
<p>I had the same problem!! what I did was took the cache folder put it onto my desktop, made a new folder called cache copy and pasted the files the cache folder just made then made it a .zip file uploaded it to <a href="http://dropbox.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">dropbox.com</a> got the link went into cachedownloader.java and changed the version to 0 and the one that says change this one to…</p>
<p><code>private final int VERSION = 0; // Version of cache
	//private String cacheLink = "http://hybridpvp.net/cache.zip"; // Link to cache
	private String cacheLink = "CHANGE THIS ONE TO YOUR LINK "; // Link to cache
</code></p>
<p>Also, I went into signlink.java and searched for C:/</p>
<p>This is what it was before (EXAMPLE)</p>
<p><code> public static String findcachedir() {
        String as[] = {"C:/hybridpvpnetcache"};</code></p>
<p>I changed to this</p>
<p><code> public static String findcachedir() {
        String as[] = {"C:/"};</code></p>
<p>underneath it had something like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>I changed to my server/client name</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Also this one</p>
<p>Before</p>
<p><code>public static String sencondDir() {
		File file = new File("./");</code></p>
<p>Changed</p>
<p><code>public static String sencondDir() {
		File file = new File("C:/");</code></p>
<p>After that I re-jarred the client but before I signed it I ran it to make sure that it ran properly and then uploaded the client/webclient.jar file to dropbox got the link and used it in this hmtl code</p>
<p>[code]</p>
