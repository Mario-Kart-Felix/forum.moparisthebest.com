This is a previous matrix based server that has started with a brand new fresh start after some problems with my router i finally founded a way to prtforward without using it (still looking to find a vps ofc lol) It might sometimes go down but will be most of the time online (unless at night cuz i have to go to school and can&#39;t keep pc on). Im looking for coders welling to help me coding the server as well as there are somethings i wanted to do but have no ideia how to do them.

          <blockquote>
              <p>Server has been updated since Last time the new updates will be posted below:</p>
<p>daily spin system added (you will only get 2 spins per 24h and it loggs the ip that got the spins so making a new account for 2 new spins will not work)</p>
<p>dwarf multi cannon 100% added (only the normal one the gold one has a small problem if you put it 2 times in the same zone at the second time you will not be able to pick it up)</p>
<p>Deathtouched darts added (not the original deathtouched darts as for some reason it wasnt killing the npcs in one hit it hits a max of 500 on nex and 1k on both corp and Qbd)</p>
<p>In-game hiscores and drop log (hiscores will let you compare your levels with another player (the target must be online to be able to compare the stats the drop log let you know how much of a determinated item have you got on drop)</p>
<p>polypore staff making and the charges from both degraded and fully staff can be removed (you can not make a fully polypore staff from a degraded one at the moment it will be added soon)</p>
<p>dungeoneering xp fixed the tokens now give more xp than they used to be making it not the hardest skill to train</p>
<p>farming has been added (rake only for the moment)</p>
<p>polypore dungeon 20% done (the npcs are all in their correct locations it is just too hard to fully code it since it has too many objects)</p>
<p>Traverly dungeon has been opened so players can kill blue dragons aswell as black dragons (you need 80 agility to pass to the black dragons part wich can be done by using the strage floor near the dungeon entrance)</p>
<p>boss kill rating and points</p>
<p>zamorak bandos saradomin zaros armadyl and corp both give points and a boss rating to the person who kills them they can then be spent at the boss shops at home (only corp doesnt has shop yet all the rest have)</p>
<p>8 new custom items besides the donator cape and light saber that were already added were added the death cape (this isnt the normal deaht cape i had the 2 models but players prefered the model with only the wings), angel wings (look a little buggy), staff capes, god axe (i thought it was suppost to be an axe but the model was everything but an axe), dual tri godsword and dual blood blades players can not use dual tri godsword without admin consent because taking out the deathtouched darts they are the best weapon in game with 500+ str bonus</p>
<p>christmas cracker and mystery cracker were both added (note that you have 5% chances of getting a rare item rom the mystery cracker due to the massive number of items that were added to it)</p>
<p>A random armour chest has been added beside the crystal key chest at home it will full your equipment tab with random equipment pieces it requires a dusty key to be opened wich can be boguth from the donated shop or got from a drop from the godwar bosses excluding nex</p>
<p>godsword and spirit shield making were added aswell full shops with buy and sell fixed (the money must be in inventory for you to be able to buy anything from the shops) money pouch 95% added (does not have the buying with money pouch method included) and it cant have more than 2147483647gp on money pouch (Aka max money :D) if the pouch has already that value it will not allowed more money into the pouch players can have a max of 3 stacks of max money 1 in bank 1 in inventory and 1 in money pouch note than if 2 stacks collide it will go back to 1 gp</p>
<p>All emotes work (the ones that have their animations on the class right but they do a totally different emote have been added as command)</p>
<p>Monkey cape (wich i think doesnt has emote on rs) has been given an emote</p>
<p>2 new commands (more than 2 :p) were added one allows an admin that knows the command to do a massive drop party all over the map wich will be used this christmas so be sure to come online for some free rares and one that allows to a staff member to warn everyone online about a castle wars or a fight pits event</p>
<p>And i believe thats all the updates by now soon there will be more awsome updates (looking for coder aswell to help me up) and do not type ::commands or ::help ingame those 2 books are outdated and need a massive update (atleast the commands book) to keep up with all the commands for players that were added i think this are all the updates for now soon ill post the newest updates of the server hope to see you online! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
