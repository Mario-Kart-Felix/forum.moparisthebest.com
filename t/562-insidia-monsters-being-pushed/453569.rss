    <title>[562] [Insidia] Monster&#39;s being pushed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-insidia-monsters-being-pushed/453569</link>
    <description>So basically I&#39;m using an Insidia source, and most of the dupes/bugs have been patched, but the PvM system was bad to begin with. The problem I&#39;m having is that when you go to kill a monster, it won&#39;t attack back. When you kill it once successfully, it starts attacking back. I want it to automatically attack back on first hit, is there a way to do this? And also, the monsters sometimes move back a brick, and you move up a brick, when you go to attack it, so it essentially &quot;pushes&quot; the monster back and you can&#39;t attack it. Is there a fix for this as well? Thanks a lot guys!</description>
