    <description>[b][size=25pt]DENIED[/size][/b]

For all you new folk who think to yourself that you want to start a server up or edit one, then you will need a client.java. To get hold of a client.java go here 

[b]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html[/b]

And look around for various sources, i reccomend Cheezscape, Once you have downloaded the server source to a folder, right click it and extract all the files inside. You will now see all various files, among these files you will comes across the client.java, You right click on this and hit open with.. Then open it with notepad.
In the Client.Java you will be able to edit many features of your server, but NOT npc&#39;s and item&#39;s etc.

[b]Uses for the client.java?[/b]

1. To add various features..
2. To add spawning/teleing etc. commands.
3. To delete and or add objects to this server (Using for example fedexers global object spawning tut)
4. To add tutorials that you may find here.
5. To access and edit commands/existing features and more.

[b]Why do i need a client.java?[/b]

Without a client.java when you are making a server, it would be incomplete. You need a client.java to edit all your main features of the server. For example edit a simple spawning command to change an item or the ammount of the item.

[b]Whats the differance between all sources client.java&#39;s?[/b]

Nearly every source has a differant client.java, people use base sources such as, Cheezscape, Project 16+, Whitescape, Testscape etc. They all are pretty much the same in a way, They all just have differant features added. If you were to compare project 16 and cheezscape 80, then project 16 would have alot more differant things to do and explore, whereas cheezscape 80 has had more time and effort put into one big project.

[b]Why does my server source folder have lots of differant files?[/b]

Most server sources have many differant files to edit all the differant outcomes.

For example, if you were to add a line to the autospawn.cfg or edit a line, you would intern be making or editing a npc. ( Non playing charachter) Or something like that =)

[b]If i add lots of stuff to my client.java can i sell it?[/b]

[size=15pt][u][b]NO[/b][/u][/size] It&#39;s against the rules to sell anything on these forums, with the exception of SCAR scripts over at http://moparisthebest.com/smf
