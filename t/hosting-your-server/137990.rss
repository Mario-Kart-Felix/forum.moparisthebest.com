    <title>Hosting your server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hosting-your-server/137990</link>
    <description>Hey guys see I left Moparscape and all of Runescape private servers for some time now. Now that i am back i have finally  gotten a actual PC I can host stuff on. My Java is not that good and i was wondering if anyone needed me to host there server for them, completely free, no cost... Just give me a link and your MSN and I can start hosting... 

See back then (i think 3 months ago) the servers were not that stable and had an uptime of like 30 min... Are they atleast stable cause if I am hosting a server I dont wanna keep going up and down my house to restart it...

  anyways.

thank you, sound/leeroy
