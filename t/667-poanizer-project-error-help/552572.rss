    <title>667 Poanizer Project error ~HELP!~</title>

    <description>Hello Moparscape Community!

I know this is the 2nd time I make a post about an error today (the other one being a devilscape error, go in client help and it should be there if you wanna check it out :P ). Ok so now I&#39;m on a 667 Project Poanizer source and I got this weird error about an ip which is 0.0.0.0 and I can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere!(I searched in source &amp; Client). I read the error (like EVERY SINGLE comment on moparscape) and I can&#39; find it (0.0.0.0). What I found is 127.0.0.1 which is local host and normal so I don&#39;t why I get the error. Thanks for helping and if you take a look at the source by yourself, my skype is sakoofortin and then we could teamviewer/screen sharing. Thanks! Btw I&#39;m new to 667  ;)  ****FIXED**** I just saw that the port 43594 was open on utorrent so I just had to close it :D</description>
