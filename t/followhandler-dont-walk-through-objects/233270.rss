    <title>followHandler - Dont walk through objects?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/followhandler-dont-walk-through-objects/233270</link>
    <description>Anyone got a followHandler/Follow code that doesn&#39;t allow you to walk through walls or objects when you&#39;re following someone? Mine lets you take the shortest root to get to the player you&#39;re following, so it just cuts through anything to get to their absx and absy.</description>

              <p>[quote=“monkey money30, post:1, topic:233278”]it does depend on what client you have if it’s silab you cant have follow handler if you have client<br>
go to <a href="http://hydrascape.net" rel="nofollow noopener">hydrascape.net</a><br>
and download the client and then ask a player named tazo he will tell you how to do it.<br>
i hope i helped a bit ;D[/quote]really? then how come the only client I’ve used is silab, yet i got follow to work. (besides the fact you walk through walls)</p>
