    <title>What do you look for in a server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-look-for-in-a-server/190271</link>
    <description>I&#39;m starting a new server based off WhiteScape, and once I fix all the obvious bugs (picking up items, all shop bugs, etc.) I plan on working on following, new skills and a bunch of other stuff. So basically what I need are some ideas on what I should add. Thanks in advance.</description>
