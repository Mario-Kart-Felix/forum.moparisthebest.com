    <description>What [i]do[/i] you look for in a server?

I look for a server that has a decent economy, high exp rate, decent player base (at least 10 daily), and fair staff.</description>

<p>Looking at the forum software? That’s an unfair bias. This is just an example, I don’t know what you prefer, but for example lets use this:<br>
So your saying the if server A uses vBulliten, and server B uses phpBB, you think server A is automatically better than B just because of the forum software? I don’t think that’s very fair.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: I take a look at the forums, see how active everything is, then when I proceed to the server, the first thing I like to see is someone at least welcoming me, this shows a small-server mentality, even in a big server. It’s also nice to not spawn for the first time at home, so its not so crowded.</p>

</aside>
<p>Actually no, I like if they use MyBB or phpBB because vBulletin is usually a trashy dev team.<br>
[/quote]<br>
It could also mean that they are working very hard on the server, and do not have time to put the effort into a decent software for the forums.  When I owned my server (long time ago), I never cared much for the forums as long as the server filled in for the forums in means of content and stability.[/quote]<br>
Every server that thinks they’re big uses vBulletin and the community is retarded.</p>
<p>Another thing I look for, I don’t like coming on and seeing the staff cursing out other staff members.</p>

Log in to the server, look at the starter, the XP rate, the staff online, then the players.</p>

              <p>I look for a first-impression of how the forums look (whether I leave or not), I look to see if the administration is competent enough, and the staff members are fair, somewhat intelligent, active, unbiased, and following the rules.</p>
