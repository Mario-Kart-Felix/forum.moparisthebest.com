    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-on-making-an-ip-i-already-have-hamachi/194685</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I was kind of curious, and I was wondering, Is there a way I can make an ip, that isnt Hamachi, or no-ip? If so can you please say so =] Thanks

BTW - I had no clue where I was supposed to post this, If this is not in the right place, I will remove it. Thanks</description>
