    <title>Can&#39;t even move in my server, HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-even-move-in-my-server-help/94358</link>
    <description>One day, everything was fine, but when I ran my server and I logged on, my character kept doing this (it&#39;s supposed to be an animation):
[IMG]http://i156.photobucket.com/albums/t32/Flamingice07/psproblem-1.gif[/img]

I could change menus and do other stuff fine, but when I tried to walk, it just froze. It was like this for any account. I have no idea what happened, and I checked everything, but it seems to be OK.

Since I have no idea what happened, I&#39;ll just post up my client.java &amp; player.java here. It would also really help if you told me what the problem was. I know it&#39;s a bit hard to do, but I would really appreciate it if someone helped, so I could actually run my server again.

Thanks, LandScape
