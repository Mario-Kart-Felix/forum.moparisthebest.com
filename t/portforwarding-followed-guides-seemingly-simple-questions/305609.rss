    <description>i have set up a server and am now trying to et the portforwarding to work. i have a no-ip host and the DUC is running i have a router it is a netgear MR814. my suspicions are that i have entered the wrong ip adress or port under either the no-ip host or the router. how do i go about finding the right one to put on? are they the same for both the router and the no-ip or different? any help for be much appreciated

EDIT:also im on windows xp if that makes any difference and also wondering if there is a way to cehck if my server is online once i think it may be working.</description>

              <p>You should be portforwarding from your router to somthing like: 192.168.1.xxx</p>
<p>On NO-IP it will be somthing like: 92.xx.xx.xx</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
