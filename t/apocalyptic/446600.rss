We are using Callypsis by netzo. It has a Hyperion game engine already in it and 474 data. Our goal is to bring new content to old-school server. So we&#39;ve gone through (and still are going through) a lot of the items that many people like to see (what draws them to servers that load 600+ content) and try to get those into our game, thus keeping the old graphics, but having the new items that players enjoy. This is a learning server, meaning that we are going to try our best to get the best educational value out of this. It&#39;s also a creative one, meaning that we want your suggestions on how to make this a fun, creative and unique server. We are planning on adding full length quests, good site to server and server to site connections and content (such as you have to register on the site before in-game) and many other things that players would like.

So how do you become a part of this? Just apply using this premade template below. You are not required to fill in all the questions, but be prepared to answer them, if you didn&#39;t on the application, when we interview you. Remember, the more you answer, the better chance you have at getting on the team.

There will be 3 steps to this process:
1. Application
2. Interview
3. Decide if your on the team

If we decide we like your application, we will PM you and set up a time to interview you. If you fill in enough information to our liking, you may be able to skip the interview process. Please do not PM us about your application. Applications will usually be reviewed within 24 - 48 hours.

Would you like more information about this development? Please ask below and we will be able to answer your questions/provide you with more information.

Thank-you for checking out our Development Team Page! We look forward to potentially working with you!
