    <title>RSCD Database Structure</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscd-database-structure/421654</link>
    <description>If you were to scrap RSCD&#39;s database structure and re-do it, what would you change?

So far, I&#39;m going to include the experience and current stats fields within the players table as they&#39;re all called at the same time so it seems stupid to have multiple joins for no reason. There&#39;s an identical amount of rows in each table anyway. 

Another thing is instead of linking the items/friends to the player by the username hash we&#39;re going to use the unique increment ID of the players table as an int will always be quicker than a varchar or bigint.</description>

              <p>You can still add yourself to your own friends list on the official RSC. Just change your display name a first and a second time. When you changed it your second time, you can add the name of your first change to your friends list. Then you will see yourself on there.</p>
<p>I also used my friends list or ignore list as a notebook earlier. On one of my accounts, I got the creation date written using my friends list or ignore list. It says around 2003 or 2004, so surely back then it worked.</p>
<p>Further on, currently my friends list got weird usernames added. It looks like the usernames hash with a “#” character in front of them. I believe it represents accounts that has been removed for some unknown reasons.</p>
<p>More on-topic: Read up on database normalization. For instance “3NF” or “BCNF” etc.</p>

<p>Eh, no… Instead of selecting all items by their username hash it will instead be by their unique players ID as it’s quicker. I might also put all bank and inventory items in one table as there’s one bank account per player.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you login RSC and try to add a random name it will say that the player can’t be found. I think it passes the request off to the login server and it handles it from there.</p>
<p>I know it’s unlikely but a player could make 100 characters adding 200 friends and 200 ignores on each which in turn makes 40,000 unneeded database entries. There’s something like 4 million friend entries on RSCE at the moment and the query time is slowing down due to it so if I can figure out a way to accept or decline their friend request I’ll do so I think.</p>
<p>There’s also no filtering with PM’s, anyone could make a bot that logs into the crowded place of Edgeville and auto-PM every player that comes into view as quickly as possible flooding their screen. As PM’s were also handled by the login server on RSC I do think there’s a lot of stuff being handled that we’re not aware of.</p>
