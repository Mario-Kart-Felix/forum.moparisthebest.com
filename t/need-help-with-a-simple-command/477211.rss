    <description>I have this command [code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;givepoints&quot;)) {
                        		try {
                                final String[] args = playerCommand.split(&quot; &quot;);
                                final String otherplayer = args[1];
                                final int point = Integer.parseInt(args[2]);
                                for (final Player player : PlayerHandler.players) {
                                        if (player != null) {
                                                if (player.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(otherplayer)) {
                                                        final Client c2 = (Client) player;
                                                        c2.magePoints += point; //CHANGE THIS TO YOUR DONOR POINTS VARIABLE
                                                        c.sendMessage(&quot;You have given &quot;
                                                                        + otherplayer + &quot;, &quot; + point
                                                                        + &quot; Donor points.&quot;);
                                                        c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been given &quot;
                                                                        + point + &quot; Donor points by &quot;
                                                                        + c.playerName + &quot;.&quot;);
                                                }
                                        }
                                }
                        } catch (final Exception e) {
                                c.sendMessage(&quot;Wrong syntax! ::givepoints name amount&quot;);
                        }
                }[/code]

But it doesn&#39;t allow me to use it if a player has a space in his or her username. So i can&#39;t give the player &quot;bro drew&quot; any donor points, but i&#39;m able to give &quot;brodrew&quot; donor points. _ and - don&#39;t work in the command neither.</description>
