    <description>[img]http://i37.servimg.com/u/f37/15/47/04/17/flusho10.jpg[/img]

Now..The thing is I thought that means to change the &quot;f&quot; In flushOutStream to &quot;F&quot; .. So When I changed all the &quot;flushOutStreams&quot;s  To &quot;FlushOutStream&quot; .. The compiler said the same error, But now the &quot;^&quot; is under the capital f..

So Someone help please?

Thanks</description>
