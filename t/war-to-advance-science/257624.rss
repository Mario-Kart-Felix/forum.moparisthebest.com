    <title>War to advance science?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/war-to-advance-science/257624</link>
    <description>history teaches us that war causes massive advances in science.

in the second world war for example, there were many areas of science that benefitted massively from the huge amounts of government spending into technologies that would help with the war.

after the war, most of these technologies can easily be adapted to piecetime.


for example, the British mathematican Alan Turing built the first computer in WWII to crack german codes, After the war, he simply rewired it and used it to try to solve the Riemann hypothesis, play chess and write love letters (true story)

after the second world war, the same technology used in nuclear weapons was used to build nuclear power stations.

i can think of many more examples, in almost all fields of science.



in war, governments spend 20x their normal budget on scientific research.
Also, in Britain at least, scientists do not get sent to battle, they are far too valuable as researchers.

i dont mean shitty little wars like iraq and afganistan, where there is no danger to the aggressors, and public opinion is against it.
the right kind of war needs to be a threat to the people of both sides, the whole country needs to feel like everyone is &quot;doing their bit&quot;. The world wars were exactly like this.


Is it right/ethical/moral to hope/pray for this kind of war?
think of the massive scientific advances it would produce.</description>

              <p>[quote=“yakman, post:38, topic:257624”]another thing was <span class="bbcode-i">flight</span>, if you just look at the dates.<br>
the first powered flight was in 1903, and in the first world war at 1914-18, planes were already advanced enough to fly to other countries and bomb them.<br>
that much development in 15 years happened because of war.<br>
now the war is finished, and we have piecetime passenger aeroplanes.[/quote]</p>
<p>Just a quick reaction to this part. Yakman, please read a history book. The planes in WWI were rubbish. They took normal rifles with them to shoot the enemy.</p>

<p>
 An electromagnetic pulse (EMP), also sometimes called a transient electromagnetic disturbance, is a short burst of electromagnetic energy. Such a pulse's origination may be a natural occurrence or man-made and can occur as a radiated, electric, or magnetic field or a conducted electric current, depending on the source.
 EMP interference is generally disruptive or damaging to electronic equipment, and at higher energy levels a powerful EMP event such as a lightning strike can damage physical obj...</p>

<p>It all depends on where it was detonated. If they were strategic and decided to drop EMP bombs over a country, it could work highly in their favour. Also, allieing countries that supply weaponry, food.</p>

I’m sure with Cars things would be a lot easier. Seeing as you can travel, have heat. Although the build up of cars to escape the city would be shit.</p>
<p>Watched a documentary the other night on Meteors. One of the stages after the crash is a giant EMP wave. Took out absolutely everything- was really good CGI watching New York and other populated cities be drowned in darkness. The after effects are scary, though.</p>
<p>But how far is current technology able to produce an EMP blast?<br>
I’ma google it.</p>

</aside>
<p>i disagree that a war would set back knowledge,<br>
for a start, EMP would not destory knowledge because most of our knowledge is stored in books, not computers.</p>
<p>i know the UK has 3 copyright libraries (meaning they get every book published) at the British Library, and Oxford and Cambridge.<br>
USA also has the Library of Congress and probably the Ivy League univercities libraries.<br>
EMPs dont kill that, but fire does.</p>
<p>for any invading army, it is much better to capture rather then destory enemy knowledge.</p>

<p>The problem with this logic is that all the young minds who might have used their intellect for creation turn it towards destruction, and those who aren’t bent die, so you end up with a massive lack of real innovation and progress.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>i really disagree with this, its simply wrong.<br>
creation and destruction are quite similar in development, like i already mentioned before, there was the war computers being used to advance mathematics, and many chemicals developed in the first world war were used for pieceful purposes.<br>
Because as happens a lot in science, the principle is exactly the same.</p>
<p>another thing was <span class="bbcode-i">flight</span>, if you just look at the dates.<br>
the first powered flight was in 1903, and in the first world war at 1914-18, planes were already advanced enough to fly to other countries and bomb them.<br>
that much development in 15 years happened because of war.<br>
now the war is finished, and we have piecetime passenger aeroplanes.</p>
<p>If WW2 never happened, we would never have had Turing, Bohr and Einstein. (obviously they’d still be alive, but they probably wouldnt have jobs as scientists)</p>

The only thing they need is pressure.<br>
It’s not like war is necessary to invent something.[/quote]</p>
<p>yes i agree, you’ve hit the nail on the head.<br>
war isnt necessary, but it helps massively.</p>
<p>[quote=“PaulT, post:29, topic:257624”]Edit, back to OP:<br>
Does science really need to be advanced further? At what point is all this bullshit counterproductive?[/quote]</p>
<p>yes it does need to be advanced further, its as simple as that.</p>
<p>when will science be counterproductive? never<br>
obviously the said war needs to finish eventually, and have a period of piece to give time to adapt the technologies to piecetime.</p>
<p>a short desperate war with a real threat of invasion for everyone is the best kind. The cold war was quite drawn out, lasting a few decades. But the world wars were only 4 or 5 years long, and had entire populations working hard to ‘do their bit’.</p>
