    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-uploader-and-a-question/92296</link>

<p>Yeah, I suppose saving it to a db would be better. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I don’t know a lot of php. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
