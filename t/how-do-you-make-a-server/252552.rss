    <title>How do you make a server?</title>

    <description>How do you make a server? I&#39;ve found a forum but it&#39;s very difficult. Can you explain it in an easy way? I already have no-ip and added a host already but I don&#39;t know how to pick a source and get it to run. Please help, thank you.</description>
