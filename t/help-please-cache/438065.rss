    <title>Help Please! Cache?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-please-cache/438065</link>
    <description>I have a server that i was working on with a friend but he cant work on it anymore and he is the one that coded everything. He gave me all the files and something named FantasyscapeXcache1. FantasyscapeX is the name of my server and i guess it is the cache. Dont really know what a cache is but i think you need it to run the server. Anyhow my server runs perfectly fine without it because i guess its already downloaded but in that other folder he sent me it had the sprites and j frame and a few other things i need to edit my server. Anyhow i dont know how to put the cache folder in my server so that it works can anyone help??????</description>
