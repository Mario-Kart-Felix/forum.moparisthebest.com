              <p>I went on the forum a noticed you basically copied everything from Runique’s website. You’re even using either an old or newer version of their userbars (will can clearly be seen as it looks like someone tried to minimize ‘Runique’ on the userbars), that’s pitiful. If you’re going to make something, use something that is made from yourself or at least edited to an extent that it’s not a complete copy.</p>
