    <title>Which is Worse?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-is-worse/147077</link>
    <description>Hey,

     I just downloaded, installed and even made an account for that shitty game, and I can honestly say that I feel that Maple Story is the [b]WORST[/b] game anyone has ever put time into. 2D Graphics or not, when there&#39;s only 3 different changes in each category for your avatar, and the first quest is to ask someone what they want for dinner, then I think snails on your nipples or slapping someone in the face with a fish is a MUCH better waste of time. That game is HORRIBLE. I couldn&#39;t bare to get through the tutorial. I just don&#39;t understand how that got big. I really don&#39;t, please someone tell me the good thing about that horrible game.</description>
