              <p>[quote="†Dro†, post:2, topic:267007"]well, does he have router or modem? if router then you need to portforward.<br>
and hoster, dont need to use ip, he can leave the ip spot blank.[/quote]Yeah, the hoster can just leave the server IP spot blank and it will connect to his localhost. But for your problem, i would say you probably need to portforward. I hate portforwarding and it can be easy or hard… Just go to <a href="http://www.portforward.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a> and find the tutorial for your router. But pay attention to the tutorial and do EXACTLY what it tells you to do.</p>
