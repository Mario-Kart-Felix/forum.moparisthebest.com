    <description>[b]Note to Moderators: This development team HAS been approved by Tico. If you have any problems contact me by PM[/b]

I am in need of:

[ul][li][i]Coders[/i][/li]
[li][i]Administrators[/i][/li]
[li][i]Moderators[/i][/li]
[li][i]Host(s[/i])[/li][/ul]


Note: Any donations received will go towards our staff. You will get a higher pay being a Host or a Coder. The only money given out is from donations only.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About myself, I am a veteran to Runescape Servers on Dodian. I decided to come back and make a new server. One that was more organized then my others. I intend on this project being big. Definately one that will go somewhere. When I mean somewhere, I mean big.

If your interested in joining my team please post here or even give me a shout by Personal Message. I am currently working on the servers client, and do need help coding, hosting, administrating, and moderating this server. The name is not yet official and can be changed

Like I said I am working on a client already but still need some help with this a bit. There are alot of new codes out there, and am sure that there are people who know how to code well. For this to be an organized project we need Moderators and Administrators. Ones that will work on both sides, server wise, and also who can keep an eye on other staff making sure they are doing things correctly. There are plenty of great servers out there, and I beleive with an organized approach we can make this server a great one, one that stands above the rest. Determination and Confidence is something I need in staff members. Without it you get nothing. [i]Starting something without determination, is starting something that will never be complete.[/i] It will all fall apart in the end.

So we need people with personalities like these, to make a [i]this server [/i] the best. If you are interested in joining send me a Personal Message or reply to this thread.

Thanks,
Kayos
