    <title>I will be your hoster!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-will-be-your-hoster/322703</link>
    <description>If anyone is looking for a hoster, i have a t1 connection and i can, and will host 24/7.
Now, all i will ask is for a runescape account.
Im not going to request any level, but i would like something level 65+ or rich, or good skills.  DOES NOT HAVE TO BE MEMBER
I would also be willing to share an account if youd like, if its a high lvl, or something.
I will host for as long as you want me to.
My dad gets computers for free, and i have a computer with nothing on it but Windows XP and a couple movies. I will never shut it off, and can be reached on xfire, or MSN, or runescape, or via text messege, or AIM, or facebook daily if you want the server shut down, or someone promoted, or have a new file for me to host.

I will be a great hoster and may go on the server from time to time, ill be an owner if you want, or not, and can also help code, (just a little bit)
but, if you are making a server, and goign to host it yourself, just know, its kinda hard to do, and will slow down your internet, but not for me : )
so please, i would like to play rs again, and dont have the time to train an account so...
Thanks
~~Jimmy

P.S. I have 12GB of RAM, so the comp is fast and will NOT lagg.</description>

              <p>First off,<br>
It’s not allowed to post such stuff like “I Can host for you 24/7” in Server Help,<br>
In server help we try to help people by posting on their topic our solutions that could solve<br>
their problems.<br>
Second off,<br>
Your Requesting an RS Account Which i think is not allowed at all.<br>
Third Off,<br>
I Don’t think a smart GUY would trust you on sharing his high level on runescape with you.<br>
Fourth off,<br>
I Don’t think a smart GUY would trust you on his files! (If he haven’t leeched it)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Fifth Off,<br>
Your other topic got locked so why did you start a new one? have you lost your brain?</span></p>
<p>Thats it for today.</p>
