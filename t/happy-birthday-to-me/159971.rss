    <title>Happy birthday to me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/happy-birthday-to-me/159971</link>
    <description>Well, it&#39;s been a year since my last birthday topic. What has changed? School is new, I still like the same girl..
Community has changed, I have stayed the same.. Which made people to forget me, most of you probably don&#39;t even know me.. 
Well. Nobody cares anyway. &#39;Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, nobody cares about me, happy birthday to me..&#39;
I still remember everyone as I used to, though people have changed. This might be my last post, maybe, maybe not.
Who cares anyway? I&#39;m just one person in such a huge community. I guess it is my destiny to be boring guy who nobody remembers.

I&#39;ve been planning of leaving the cheating scenes, but always when I tried to, I found something which tied to me on the forums.
I find this forum the one closest to me, with such friendly people and... Meh.
