<p>You can have it send a link sent to the registered email confirming the deletion.</p>
<p>I don’t know why they don’t want to add any updates for accounts. Avatars wasn’t really something that benefits the user although something like being able to remove threads, changing names, even allowing people to post comments on user profiles etc would.</p>
<p>Instead of account deletion why not do what Facebook does and allow the user to deactivate their accounts?</p>

<p>i don’t think the concept is needed, but i don’t see harm in adding it.<br>
whether it be a simple user group change, post prune, or full deletion.</p>
<p>we should have the ability to remove data we don’t like (perhaps just allowing deletion of posts/topics, even after they’ve been locked)</p>
<p>no staff member is obligated to restore data we’ve lost by accident. perhaps a lengthy ‘confirm deletion’ kind of like a registration form, to make it complicated to ‘accidentally’ delete. and make it on a timer(maybe taking up to 24 hours or more to fully process, incase of hacked accounts) this gives the user time to notify staff (even tho they don’t do anything about lost/stolen accounts because it’s our fault blah blah.</p>

              <p>Well, I really don’t care for account deletion. If one doesn’t want to come to these forums, they don’t have to have their account deleted in order for them to do so.

I am fairly certain SMF has such capabilities. I am not suggesting pruning all posts, but rather the account (resulting in the group change to guest). Many other sites, including forums, offer such a capability. I believe the suggest appeals to moparisthebest (person) in that I should have ownership over my data and have the freedom to remove it if the environment can facilitate it. I am not sure what you’re getting at with the maturity of this community - do you fear people delete their accounts by mistake and then want them back? If that’s the case it’s their own fault.</p>

All this will warrant is loads of people deleting their accounts and then messing around with it, and then you’ll have like three people who will actually want to keep their account deleted.</p>
<p>Such controls don’t belong on this community, simply because the community is too immature to make consistent decisions. Also, let’s be realistic here, we’ve been waiting on forum code for like three years if this were to happen it’d be the vanilla package that comes with SMF (aka you can remove your account and your never getting it back again) which is a terrible idea. You’re effectively asking me why I refuse to advocate losing 2/3 of the community and having my work load greatly increased so a few old timers can be at peace, I think the idea is absurd and I know Moparisthebest shares that view.</p>

<p>No, what if you deleted your account then somebody else registers using that name.<br>

That’s not how that works, I’m pretty sure.</p>

You can re-register accounts that are Guests. The guest accounts post will still remain under a guest status but other people can still use that name (they can’t edit the guest stuff tho).</p>
