    <title>Need help, found out runescapes ip address</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-found-out-runescapes-ip-address/75888</link>
    <description>Ok, me and my friend came to the point of trying to get runescapes ip address, so we did.

start -&gt; run -&gt; cmd -&gt; start nslookup -&gt; www.runescape.com -&gt; 65.39.250.68 (and many more ips).

in nslookup we typed in www.runescape.com and came up with loads of ips address&#39;s, so we took one (65.39.250.68) and pasted it in the browser, press go.. and we are at www.runescape.com but it didnt redirect, in the browser it still said http://65.39.250.68 so then we thoght it could be a server, so we went to http://www.ip-adress.com/ typed in 65.39.250.68 and pressed ip look up we got a bunch of info and a map of the location.

IP address info: 
IP address:  65.39.250.68 (copy) 
IP country:  United States  
IP Address state:   
IP Address city: New York 
IP postcode: 10004 
IP latitude: 40.688801 
IP longitude: -74.020302 
ISP:  Peer 1 Network 
Organization: JAGEX LIMITED 


see? organization jagex limited, ip address city: newyork.. so yeah this ip is the newyorks server..i think.

so we then were lost, so we thoght of typing it in moparscape lolz, so we typed in a real username and password, and then the ip..we got a error.

now, we are at a point of being lost, we thoght this info could be usefull to someone, so thats why ive posted it. any help appeciated.</description>

Have any of you heard of TeamSpeak? Well I use that for GWs Guilds and stuff.

Well I couldn’t even IP ban them because they logged in and out too fast. (Plus I was hosting the server soo ya) but I did get the IP.  I wrote it down then I gave it to the owner of the server and he called his internet service provider and no more internet for him.</p>
<p>I see it happen to peoples servers all the time, but idk. I think its pretty stupid doing something like that.</p>

It would take a massive attack to take down a game server and you would be IP banned before you even got properly started - the chances of finishing the attack would be next to none.</p>
