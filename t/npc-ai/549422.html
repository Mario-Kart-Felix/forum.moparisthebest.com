        <p>I have seen some half ass hackish ways of having NPCs “react” to a players actions. I myself can admit to participating as RSCD based servers are extremely coupled code wise. Marwolfs post in the help section, where people reacted by showing off npc vs npc battles is a clear example of how limited we are with an actual AI system. It has been done since 2008 (maybe before) and yet the only actual public example is xEnts from RSCA source (Which again doesn’t do anything with the highly coupled code and just embraces it)</p>
<p>In the RSCD source we have Entity -&gt; Mob -&gt; NPC &amp; Player which determines the differences between a Player and NPC</p>
<p>By adding the RangeEvent and its methods to the the Mob class, you can call on NPC’s having the ability to range whatever you want them too. The same thing with Mage, Trading, Dueling etc etc. I so far got to the point where you can trade an npc but the npc doesn’t offer anything (yet)</p>
<p>The difference between an NPC and a Player is that the server handles the logic for npcs and not sending packets to any client while the player requires packets.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my question. Is it better to give the MobileEntity class more features (maybe just make them abstract and handle the methods differently in both the NPC and Player class) or should I just take the event package and duplicate it for NPC usage (which would be stupid, but I have seen people do it for some reason) because the DelayedEventHandler should handle all events.</p>
<pre><code>public DelayedEvent(Mob owner, int delay) {
    this.owner = owner;
    this.delay = delay;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Giving each MobileEntity its own viewarea, I am not worried about for memory saving as I won’t have more than 300-400 loaded any any single time.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>Everything in RSCD is half assed and hackish. Also there is no “AI” system, shitty hardcoded code everywhere is what it is.</p>

The best approach is to give Mob class every possible function that Mobs have in common, interactions(attack, follow, whatever), stats, other misc variables as well.</p>

<p>No…why the fudge would you do that? DelayedEvent is abstract and should take in the most basic version of the object required(Entity). In some cases you might need to use delayed events for game objects and when you do, you don’t need to do anything ‘hackish’.</p>

<p>Each Mob already has their own “ViewArea”, and the “ViewArea” class does not hold any objects thus doesn’t increase memory usage, in fact it every method in there should be static and take in Entity argument, there are only functions to return lists of entities.<br>

<p>Right… I was reffering to the Player class and how it handles viewed players/items/objects for updating. So you’re suggesting I take a findVictim() approach and just iterate through all local entities that I want to find (you can find this in the NPC class). Wouldn’t this become quite excessive at some point and better to just populate the StatefulEntityCollection class? Each npc will have to iterate through local items/objects/npcs/players each process? Thoughts?</p>
<p>For Players, it’s used for updating, I’m questioning if it would be ideal to just have it available and deal with the constant updates of the the collection, or just to constantly iterate throw the local region. ? I haven’t done any memory analysis on it yet. I would like NPCs and their logic to be processed about every 1 second or so and not event based. Players action causes npc to spawn etcetc as Npcs will constantly be reacting to other Npcs</p>

You don’t need NPCs to have a local list of known ëntities that would be dumb thing to do since the only reason players have it is to keep track of entities client is aware of.</p>

No, they can be player-driven. You would fire off NPC logic when certain conditions are met (i.e., a player walks within x steps of an NPC -&gt; notify the npc of the event, launch it’s event handling logic).</p>

        <p>Correct, as we (as a community) have already been doing that. That is very basic and I would like to attempt at something that gives a “real” feeling. What about the scenario where an NPC ‘reacts’ to multiple objectactions, local items being manipulated and even players. Then I am obligated to write hundreds and hundreds of ‘scenarios’ or reactions to handle the logic.</p>
<p>I am thinking something a long the lines of an NPC tick, like the updateNpcPositions(); on the same thread as the GameEngine Where NPC’s can be scripted and each tick they handle logic, and possibly mixing that with a stage system. Which there, the logic relies on scanning the local region. The major event which ticks every 600ms updates the collections. Why not just let it handle it there instead of scanning?</p>
<p>Which goes back to my question…</p>

<p>There is no ‘scanning’ the region more than once per tick, what you are thinking of doing is exactly what findVictim() is already doing, so if you are thinking of doing a proper system just pass the region entities as argument instead of trying to keep track of them locally,the lists shouldn’t change at all during ticks unless your whole server is built wrong.</p>
<p>Again the only reason players have StatefulEntityCollections is to keep track of entities that client knows and doesn’t know and send appropriate updates to client. Only valid reason to keep track of local entities for NPCs is that you have to access them more than once per tick, that way you don’t need to iterate through the exact same list multiple times during tick.</p>

That’s just wrong. First of all you don’t need to add both players watched players into one list, the victims local player list is enough(because to interact with a player you need to be in range), and you should use local player list instead of doing hundreds of iterations just to get the same list from view area. But here’s the funny part, you shouldn’t be informing players around you at all, instead they should be informed about you.</p>

        <p>No, it’s not completely wrong. As I already mentioned that in projectile related events you need to grab the local players in both the owner and the affectedmobs location.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/9ac3e5747e5289099bd88d84168ff8a2.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>If you take only “the victims local player list” then you would be missing out on the senders local area.<br>
However, in a duel event, where the same iteration happens, there is no need due to lack of spacing.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:13, topic:549422”]No, it’s not completely wrong. As I already mentioned that in projectile related events you need to grab the local players in both the owner and the affectedmobs location.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/9ac3e5747e5289099bd88d84168ff8a2.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>If you take only “the victims local player list” then you would be missing out on the senders local area.<br>
However, in a duel event, where the same iteration happens, there is no need due to lack of spacing.</p>

Your are bit wrong on that, your logic is fine but that’s not how it really works. When you create the list of local players you will scan all regions around the players and then fliter out players who are over 16 squares away, and those who are over 16 squares away are not aware of the victim which results in projectile not showing anyway.</p>

Like I mentioned before, you should be building the lists while sending updates to client.</p>
<p>I wrote this on the reply box, but should be a good enough example.</p>

public void setProjectileUpdateRequired(Projectile p) {
      this.projectile = p;

public boolean needsProjectileDisplayed() {
 return projectile != null;
}

public Projectile getProjectileNeedingDisplayed() {
return projectile;
}

public void reset() {//Call upon updateCollections
   projectile = null;
}</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">LinkedList&lt;Projectile&gt; projectileUpdates = new LinkedList&lt;Projectile&gt;();
for(Player p : playerToUpdate.getWatchedPlayers().getKnownEntities()) {
if(p.needsProjectileDisplayed()) {
projectileUpdates.add(p.getProjectileNeedingDisplayed());

It does, don’t you know that if you are not aware of a player, he is not aware of you and other way around. So sending updates without both players in your view is useless because the projectile won’t go anywhere in their view. Which also means that iterating through casters view will be useless because you would be informing players about projectile which can’t be seen in their screen, and if it can, then iterating through victims local players is enough.</p>

</aside>
<p>No I haven’t and the difference is rather small I believe, but it is in many ways better approach. Instead of doing iterations every time you want to send updates to players around, you only set one variable and the main update loop does it for you.</p>

        <p>Maybe I am thinking of the RS2 client and how it draws projectiles without second player/mob being within view. If the rsc client doesn’t draw it at all, then I will be adding it. This isn’t an issue with a replica as both the sender and reciever are both pretty close due to radius limitations of projectile but I extended it a while back. So it just depends on how lengthy the distant between the mobs are.</p>
<p>Yea I understand what you’re saying about the player updating, makes sense. I’m sure I’ll tackle it in the near future, thanks for the spoon.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/coolae52.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>

The version of projectile of RS2 you are thinking about is the wrong one, there are two, one which uses the entity index(for following projectiles) and one which takes a position. No matter what you will need the client to be aware of the victim and you can’t do it without extending the view range.</p>
