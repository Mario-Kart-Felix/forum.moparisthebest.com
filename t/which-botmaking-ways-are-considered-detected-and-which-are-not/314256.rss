    <title>Which botmaking ways are considered detected and which are not?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-botmaking-ways-are-considered-detected-and-which-are-not/314256</link>
    <description>1) Deob
2) Extension bot
3) BCEL
4) Reflection
5) Java-agent
6) Process attaching

These are the ones that came into my mind right now. I got interested in RS2 botmaking, but it would be nice if someone would give me some hints on what botmaking ways are detected and what are considered safe. What does Jagex check for? Do they check for packages and classes in them? What kind of class file modifications are detected and do they check for field/method access specifiers?

Are any of these botmaking ways 100% undetectable? Or do you have to exactly know what kind of detection methods Jagex uses so that you can modify those methods to not detect what they&#39;re meant to detect?

Thanks.</description>

<p>These are the ones that came into my mind right now. I got interested in RS2 botmaking, but it would be nice if someone would give me some hints on what botmaking ways are detected and what are considered safe. What does Jagex check for? Do they check for packages and classes in them? What kind of class file modifications are detected and do they check for field/method access specifiers?</p>
<p>Are any of these botmaking ways 100% undetectable? Or do you have to exactly know what kind of detection methods Jagex uses so that you can modify those methods to not detect what they’re meant to detect?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
