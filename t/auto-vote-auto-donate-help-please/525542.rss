Tbh i have no clue how to do this and was wondering if some1 can please help me with this, when i run the source it already says connecting to auto donation system, auto donation system has been configured, under that it says connecting to vote system vote system has been configured idk if this will help to skip a step in the process or not but can some1 please help me add this?</description>

              <p>[quote=“DaGamerChild, post:2, topic:525542”]First off, you need an SQL database. Just “Google” free SQL.<br>
Next, you’re going to need a web host. I suggest 000webhost. If you’re paying, try 24hosting.<br>
Finally, just “Google” tutorials. Make sure you include your source, such as PI, in your search. If you have any problems, just tell me. I’ll be here to assist you. However, I won’t always be there so it’s best to learn how to do it on your own.[/quote]<br>
Alright thanks man, when i get home from this vaccation ill try that</p>
