    <title>I made a terrible mistake</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-made-a-terrible-mistake/180825</link>
    <description>I modded Tru3scape last night on my server, editing several things. Number one I sped up the server (or so i though) by editing packets off a tutorial. Secondly I added a spell to my server using a command and also made pickup superadmin only and up. Well, it turns out now I cant use any commands at all. I removed everything that had to do with RS2 private servers, ran a full cookie+cash deletion and it still doesn&#39;t work. Even people that join my server can&#39;t do it. Please help.</description>
