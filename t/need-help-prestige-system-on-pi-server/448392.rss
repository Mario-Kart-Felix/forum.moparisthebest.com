    <description>Hello everyone.
I&#39;ve been looking for many tutorials about prestige system and i didn&#39;t find what i was looking for.
I&#39;m wondering if anyone would like to help me on the system that i want, and i know it&#39;s a possible system ( i&#39;ve seen in on a server ).

Here&#39;s what i am looking for... 
My prestige system should look like this :

Player that gets level 99 in all combat skills, can talk to a npc that will offer him to prestige to level 1. 
saying stuff like :
NPC: Hello &quot;playername&quot;, Do you want to prestige your account?       -click to continue....
Now change chat to and offering text clicking options : 1 : Yes, i would like to prestige. 2: No i don&#39;t want to Prestige. 3: I would like to acces to the Prestige shop.
•Choosing options 1 = NPC talks : Warning, you are about to prestige... If you do prestige, you will reset all your combat stats to level 1...... are you sure you want to prestige?.
now it shows 2 more options : 1-Yes! I want to Prestige! ....... 2-Nevermind, I don&#39;t want to prestige.
          Options 1 = Reset all your combat skills, gives you a title next to your name : [Prestige 1] and gives 5 permanent bonus stats in all your combat skills.
          Options 2 = a player dialogue text saying : Nevermind, I don&#39;t want to prestige, click to continue then close the dialogue chat.
•Choosing options 2 = Quit the dialogue.
•Choosing options 3 = it opens the veteran shop and you can buy with PK Points...

*** 1 level per prestiges must gives 5 permanent bonus stats in combat skills ***
For people that doesn&#39;t understand what i mean :
prestige 1 = 5 bonus in all combat stats...
prestige 2 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 1 + prestige 2 = 10 bonus in all combat stats )
prestige 3 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 2 + prestige 3 = 15 bonus in all combat stats )
prestige 4 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 3 + prestige 4 = 20 bonus in all combat stats )
prestige 5 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 4 + prestige 5 = 25 bonus in all combat stats )
prestige 6 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 5 + prestige 6 = 30 bonus in all combat stats )
prestige 7 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 6 + prestige 7 = 35 bonus in all combat stats )
prestige 8 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 7 + prestige 8 = 40 bonus in all combat stats )
prestige 9 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 8 + prestige 9 = 45 bonus in all combat stats )
prestige 10 = 5 bonus in all combat stats... ( prestige 9 + prestige 10 = 50 bonus in all combat stats )


-Normal player : Able to prestige up to 5 levels.
a total of 25 permanent bonus stats in all combat skills for a prestige 5.

-Normal donator : Able to prestige up to 7 levels
a total of 35 permanent bonus stats in all combat skills for a prestige 7.

-Super donator : Able to prestige up to 9 levels
a total of 45 permanent bonus stats in all combat skills for a prestige 9.

-Extreme donator : Able to prestige up to 10 levels
a total of 50 permanent bonus stats in all combat skills for a prestige 10.

-Moderators and Admins can only prestige up to 5 untill they donate...

I know this is something hard ( well too hard for me and haven&#39;t found any tutorials for it )
You will get rep++ for helping me out and also gets rep++ by others cause i&#39;m pretty sure there will be lots of people using it.
