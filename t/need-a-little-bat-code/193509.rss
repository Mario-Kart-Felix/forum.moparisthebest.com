    <title>Need a little .bat Code</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-little-bat-code/193509</link>
    <description>Okay, here&#39;s my dilemma: 
I like to make a back-up of my server... a lot, and it&#39;s getting annoying to have to keep on going &#39;Copy All Files&#39;, and then go to the back-up folder, and &#39;Paste All Files&#39; after deleting all the current files in the back-up folder.

So, is it possible anybody could make me a .bat file or something to copy my whole server source folder, and paste it in the back-up folder. 

If you make a .bat file for this, I will be able to change the file names, so you can put whatever there, but please just make it working. lol

Or, even better, if you could make it so that it makes a NEW folder somewhere, with the name being the date, and then &#39;-BackUp&#39;
Ex.: 3-27-08-BackUp

Something like that.

Sorry if that&#39;s confusing. :P

Thanks in advance, 
Zach

PS. I&#39;m going AFK for a bit, but will be back to check this thread. Thanks! 

Just add the .bat file in an attachment. =]</description>
