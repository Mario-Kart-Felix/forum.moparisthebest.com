    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[size=23pt][b]A six-year-old boy has died after falling through ice into a fishing pond near Pontefract on Saturday.[/b][/size]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The child and another boy, aged 12, had been on the ice near Red Lane in Streethouse when it cracked, sending them both into the water below.

The older boy was pulled from the pond, but the six-year-old had to be recovered by fire service divers.

He was airlifted to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, but was pronounced dead at 19:05 GMT.

The 12-year-old was taken to the same hospital where he is believed to be well but suffering from the effects of the cold water.

Local residents tried to reach the boy but the ice was too thick
