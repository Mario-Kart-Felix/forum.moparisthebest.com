    <description>Right..

I&#39;ve portforwarded and such, done the no-ip thing and what not.
I&#39;ve used runelocus to check to see if it was online, it was.

How come I can&#39;t login with my no-ip on my client but with localhost it works?
- Players can login with the no-ip but my localhost can&#39;t.
- Main reason for this is I have a brother that wishies to play.


Wondering if anyone could give me any pointers whether its my client or something.</description>

<p>Change the IP in YOUR client to your computers IP, witch is the ip you portforwarded with… if you dont know what im talking about… then search for the cmd… and open it up, type ipconfig. Then it will say your computers IP in there. You should know what im talking about though, if youve already portforwarded.[/quote]</p>

<p>download the no-ip DUC and update your no-ip <a href="http://www.no-ip.com/client/ducsetup.exe" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Then change your client ip to ur no-ip if u didn’t.</p>
