    <title>2009 Mustang [Second Attempt]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2009-mustang-second-attempt/296081</link>
    <description>Well, I had made a mustang before which I thought turned out well but I wasnt exactly satisfied, so I decided to start from scratch and make a new one. I will show you the first attempt as well as the second one.

First attempt:

You&#39;ll notice some stuff there which shouldnt be there, or is sized bad, but hey, it was my first serious attempt at a car.

Second attempt:

No, this one isnt perfect either, but i think its a huuuge improvement.

I would love some criticism on this, nothing useless though, thanks.</description>

<p>Your car is still box shaped. The fender to the door to the back tire has a nicer flow, but it’s all flat basically. The back tire’s wheel well pokes out in a very odd way, like a bowl is attached to the side of the car. It should be more like the front tire’s well. You’ve got the windows done nicely, but that’s also since it’s so flat.</p>
<p>The hood pokes out more, and it curves a lot too. Yours is also kinda flat. The only thing I can say about the spoiler is, take it off.</p>
<p>We really need more views, and some wireframes, to help you.</p>
<p>And also about the wheels. Make them normal wheels, and watch some tutorials on making rims. Yours are just faces to the front of the wheels. Real rims extend into the wheel, keeping it all together, and attach to the car.</p>

              <p>thats better all the panels are looking like that they are together, this is good, secondly, texture that bloody windscreen with an opaque texture coz we can see the back wheel. Needs more light showing the front end as that is largely a character of the car, still a bit boxy but a good improvement keep going</p>
