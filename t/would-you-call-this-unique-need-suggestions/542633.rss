    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-you-call-this-unique-need-suggestions/542633</link>
    <description>What if there was a server in which the sole purpose was to obtain items from other players? Let me show you what I mean:

It all begins, a server with no monster drops, no starter items, no shops, no items for skilling (despite being able to skill without and resources), basically it is impossible to obtain any items other than from the creator at this point, who will have to host a drop party with some items to kick-start the ecconomy. 
So after people obtain items, people are going to have to do something with these items. Show them off like a pimp shows off his top hoe, leak them to the public, trade them to others, etc. Except since the game is built on obtaining rares, there needs to be something that really makes the game different.
Eventually the end there will have to be someone who takes the title as being &#39;the richest player&quot; the top dog (or top scammer) who planned well to get above the rest.
What if trade was disabled? I.e you can show the items you have in trade but you can&#39;t actually accept, and so you can ONLY drop trade the items. This would make trade much more risky, as you will need to trust the other person won&#39;t scam you (which also isn&#39;t a crime).

If you people could give me some sort of feedback on this concept, as I have made a server exactly like this (I&#39;m not advertising as I&#39;m not giving the name of the rsps in this thread) it would be cool to see if this would be something people would be willing to play.

 Thank you for your time.</description>

<p>Godzhell has ended. So my server will be the only one like this. I don’t think you understand, there is no “better” item… All items are rare to begin with and this is a rare-collecting server, not a pk server in which you fight for other players’ items. Right now I made it that nobody loses items in wild, so killing someone has no value and is just for fun.</p>
<p>You people have played the same things for ages that you are ignorant to try anything new. As I had said I already have 40+ players on constantly who all love this style of playing before Godzhell ended. I just made the conditions for rare-collecting perfect.</p>

              <p>I don’t really see the point. Once a player reaches the ‘top dog’ status they’ll just keep their items, and if there’s only a certain amount of items in the economy then they’ll presumably have the best items and nobody else will be able to compete.</p>
<p>And you’d need to improve that drop trade idea. If you’re going to allow scamming, fair enough, but don’t make it easy for each party. Allow them to only drop items in the wilderness so players may have their own form of justice system if a trade goes awry. Then just enable a ‘destroy’ option for items that players want to get rid of to replace the drop option in normal circumstances. Edit: Just realise this part could lead to trust issues as players could just kill users anyway, so maybe have it in the duel arena? Or live with the risk of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Just my two cents.</p>

<p>In my game I provide people with essentials for training. Like runes (not all) and bones, bronze sword, sharks, shortbow, arrows. You don’t need any items for skilling as I made it in a way you don’t need resources to skill.<br>
There is already a community of former GodzHell players (Godzhell has ended) who all wanted a server like this, so we already have a strong community of players who we have known eachother for years.</p>
<p>Personally I think my server will suceed. I am fortunate to already have a community and any new players is just a bonus, we all are experienced in this concept.</p>

<p>This, however, would be long term and there wouldn’t really be anything to show except your skills with picking up items.</p>
<p>The point about trading is also not good. Instead of trying to get people to trade resources / items for other resources / items, the players will alienate the idea on the malicious risk that is involved.</p>
<p>Even if you have a normal server, someone will generally still be considered the richest player and many people will compete for that title because it’s honor worthy as they probably had to work hard to achieve it(assuming no donations are involved)</p>

              <p>What if there was a server in which the sole purpose was to obtain items from other players? Let me show you what I mean:</p>
<p>It all begins, a server with no monster drops, no starter items, no shops, no items for skilling (despite being able to skill without and resources), basically it is impossible to obtain any items other than from the creator at this point, who will have to host a drop party with some items to kick-start the ecconomy.<br>
So after people obtain items, people are going to have to do something with these items. Show them off like a pimp shows off his top hoe, leak them to the public, trade them to others, etc. Except since the game is built on obtaining rares, there needs to be something that really makes the game different.<br>
Eventually the end there will have to be someone who takes the title as being 'the richest player" the top dog (or top scammer) who planned well to get above the rest.<br>
What if trade was disabled? I.e you can show the items you have in trade but you can’t actually accept, and so you can ONLY drop trade the items. This would make trade much more risky, as you will need to trust the other person won’t scam you (which also isn’t a crime).</p>
<p>If you people could give me some sort of feedback on this concept, as I have made a server exactly like this (I’m not advertising as I’m not giving the name of the rsps in this thread) it would be cool to see if this would be something people would be willing to play.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
