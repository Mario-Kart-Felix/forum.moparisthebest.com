    <title>People posting their server as mine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-posting-their-server-as-mine/270692</link>
    <description>Well, I think it doesn&#39;t really belong to server help so fix me if I&#39;m wrong. Anyway, I had my server posted on serverstatus page and it was there for a while, about 4 days. Then it got removed from the list. Now, one other server have been posting their server under my ip and advertising their own by putting there their own screenshots and their server ip. There are several servers with same problem. Even if it gets removed from the list, it will be readded right after it. I don&#39;t even get a chance to post my own. It&#39;s so annoying. Is there a way to solve it and stop them from doing it?</description>
