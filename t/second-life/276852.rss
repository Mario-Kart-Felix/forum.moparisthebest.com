&lt;blockquote&gt;Second Life is a free online virtual world imagined and created by its Residents. From the moment you enter Second Life, you&#39;ll discover a fast-growing digital world filled with people, entertainment, experiences and opportunity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I only just heard about it, it seems pretty good. Then again, they&#39;re going overboard on the &quot;we require birth certificate&quot; thing</description>

So, what is the real aim in this game?<br>
[/quote]<br>
It’s a social simulation/trick to get you to spend a lot of money attempting to make money and end up with none - unless you beat the odds, of course.<br>
What I mean by that is that even if you create your own textures/objects/scripts you still have to spend money to upload your textures, pay tier on a place to rent to sell them, pay advertising fees to attract customers, etc. Usually most businesses like that fail. Then you can try the 18+ venues of work like escort [eg prostitute], dancer at clubs or stripper, but according to some of my friends who’ve tried it there is too much competition there. Also, my guess would be that now that SL has integrated voice you’d have to really be a girl to make major money.<br>
About beating the odds - doing what I did - that’s really just up to chance. By chance I signed up before they lowered the stipends, so that I actually was paid to play. By chance I stumbled upon a job paying me 0.895 dollars an hour to do nothing [this was actually considered a high paying job], resulting in 25.25 dollars a week. By chance I was able to trick several people into believing I was a college student when I was actually 13. And by chance I didn’t lose my job when the immature 21 year old son of the rich capitalist who owned the place I worked at [he had over 1,000,000 linden dollars or 4,000 us dollars on his account, and probably much more invested in the place] went on his father’s account and banned me from the parcel. [My boss knew him IRL and unbanned me a few minutes later]. That was nearly two years ago, but I doubt things have changed that much.[/quote]Long story is long</p>
<p>I only use it to mess around with the player (change shape and texture)</p>
