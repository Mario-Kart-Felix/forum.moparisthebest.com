    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-no-clip-quicker-with-peters-map-editor/464896</link>
    <description>ok so im using peters map editor to make custom maps for my rsps project and well since im recoloring/resizing parts where its just water it is all clipped. and im making sorta big custom map and im wondering if theres an easier/QUICKER way to no clip the tiles because noclipping 1000 tiles would take... bout forever.  just wondering if anyone knows a quicker way thanks also i went into the coding of the map editor and was trying to see if i could make something like if the tile is selected and i click key &#39;b&#39; it would make it auto no clip but im not experienced enough in java to know how to make that. well any help/info would be awesome thanks</description>
