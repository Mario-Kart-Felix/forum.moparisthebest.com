you know why this will never end, and only get worse? I’ll explain:<br>
All 9 year olds.<br>
The first 9 year old arrived at mscp.<br>
he opened up a c00l serber.<br>
his other 9 year old friends on their periods saw and opened up their own.</p>
<p>thus multiplying… if any time… that was the time to stop them.<br>
now, they come in hordes, they beg and get spoonfed in the help section, leech in the dl section, then when they’re done, they advert the server on the boards.<br>
If you get rid of one, they come back with 10 more people. and if you get rid of them, each 9 year old comes with 10 more 9 year olds. And the process just keeps repeating… and now its an unstoppable force… they outnumber us 1:infinity… you cant win… you cant stop them… its denying the inevitable, they are probably the most powerful trolling/piss off/community killing force in the entire world. so im sorry, nothing can be done about it.</p>
<p>And you know what? Same thing is happening to runescape. thats why its full of cocky dickheads now, and once one 9 year old found out about powerbot/rsbuddy, boom, too late, runescape is dead too.</p>
<p>And the only way you can fight back is fire with fire… troll with troll…<br>
[/quote]How do you kill that which has no life?[/quote]<br>
they both did, once,i remember stalking mscp around 06… just looked around @ topics, etc… and rs in 05 was a lot better, better players, etc.</p>

[/quote]I’m sorry… you must be new here.[/quote]</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>RSE have always been this way. Now it’s PI, Before it was Delta, Then Czar, etc.</p>
<p>The community (I’m not talking exclusively about MSCP) is mostly comprised of 11-14 year old children, who think it’s “cool” to have one, but don’t want to put in the work to actually learn the language. Which is why PI has things like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int inWilderness = 0;</code></pre>
<p>If you need an explanation on why that is wrong, then I suggest learning the basics of Java first.when you ask them to “think in a logical manner”, you get an angry response that basically says “FUCK YOU! I’m new to this shit and nobody is help me! This is why MSCP is the shithole of the RSE community &gt;:(”. No sir, you are the reason.</p>
<p>The other portion of this community is people who have been here a while, know Java to the point where RSE aren’t the only thing they do, and any RSE work they do is completely custom; no wL code inside (Hyperion, RuneSource, etc).</p>
