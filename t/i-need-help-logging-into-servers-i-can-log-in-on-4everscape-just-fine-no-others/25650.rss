    <title>I need help logging into servers, I can log in on 4everscape just fine.No others</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-logging-into-servers-i-can-log-in-on-4everscape-just-fine-no-others/25650</link>
    <description>I&#39;m so very sorry to ask this...really.I&#39;ve been all over the forums and can&#39;t find the answer to this particular one.

Alright I have Mopar 3.2(interesting if he made a Hemi version eh?).

I copy/paste the IP for 4everscape and get in no problem.
If I do the same for another server though I get the &quot;Error connecting&quot; message.And I have tried a bunch of them.Any with a different port I enter the port number in the port area in &quot;File&quot;.
I have downloaded Hamachi but I can&#39;t understand how these two interact with each other.I have it running now.Is it just so people can tell each other what IP to go on?Or does it actually work like X-fire and join a game for you?

Also on the server advertisment page I can&#39;t tell which are Hamachi servers and which are not.

Thanks so much for your time and I hope you can help.</description>

              <p>No it’s not that at all.I always have the server checker running and it’s accurate.What it is I cant get into these ones that have either a regular looking I.P. number and ones that say “No-ip”.If it says <a href="http://blahblahgame.servergame.com" rel="nofollow noopener">blahblahgame.servergame.com</a> or something I can get into it.</p>
