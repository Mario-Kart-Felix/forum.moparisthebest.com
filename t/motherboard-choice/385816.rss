I knew this would happen, thanks to Newty making me put together parts for his computer from newegg, now I think I might upgrade my computer (purchased parts 10/30/2006 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), here is the build I&#39;m considering:

http://www.moparisthebest.com/builds/moparisthebest.html

I can&#39;t decide between those two motherboards though, can anyone help me?  I have never had a bad MSI board ever, this one is still working from 2006, and I even have older ones in various other computers I have built over the years.  I also have had a few MSI video cards with no problems.  Asus is supposed to be a good company too, but all I have ever had from them is a nice laptop that only lasted about 2 years before the integrated video card burned out.  So, just from these two facts, I&#39;d go with the MSI no problem, but it has a lot of negative reviews stating that many of them have arrived DOA.

Opinions?</description>

              <p>Oh, the other issue I wasn’t sure about was that the ram I’m getting is DDR3 1600, and the Asus says it supports that, and the MSI only supports it overclocked supposedly.  They both have the same north and south bridges, which I thought was what controlled the RAM anyhow.  I’ve never overclocked RAM and don’t know about this either.</p>

If that particular MSI board has neg reviews I’d consider trying to find another one if you like that brand, or I can’t see you having any trouble with the Asus.</p>
