              <p>Turn your firewall OFF before you hit register, make sure that the port 43594, or whatever port your server is on is portforworded and then turn your server on. Make sure you are giving them the write IP for the server, if your not using a No-IP its your internal ip, like 192.168.62.1 for example. No-IP can be tricky for some people. Make sure you turn your firewall back on after you register.</p>
