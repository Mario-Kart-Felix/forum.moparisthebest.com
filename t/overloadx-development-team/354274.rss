Hello everyone and thank you for taking an interest in our project. We&#39;re a newly formed team, each specializing in different fields. Our management currently consists of myself, the Head of Community, Chris the Project Manager, Alex our lead Java client coder.

Right now our necessity relating to staff is to find some enthusiastic and self-motivated coders to help work on creating new in-game content, develop new ideas to keep players entertained, and to help iron out the bugs when they become apparent.

Here is some features we&#39;re currently working on/have already implemented:

Custom Java Frame:

<p>As for the person who claims we have only added a custom J-Frame, that is untrue. Our coder started with a basic PI and has coded it up to par. So far adding in 3 skills not previously added along with fully working godwars bosses and minions. Custom monsters releated to our name, I could continue to go on but I will not waste my time.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also take into account that we are still in beta, and are preparing for release.</p>

<p>Apparently you never did read that, or anyone else here. It says the work must be your own. Everyone here usually starts off from using a source from the downloads section, which, to me, defeats the entire purpose of this section.</p>
<p>This section should be for creating new servers from scratch since that could actually require a development team to stop it from becoming like most of the current servers. If you are using an already created source then all the work is pretty much done(horribly), and even if it’s not there is no need for a development team.</p>

<p>I Vain I keen to work with me on my cleaned Battlescape? I never get round to adding features because I always find something else that needs cleaning and do that instead <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Oh there is nothing wrong with it as such. I just prefer to start from pretty much nothing rather than using what other people have done. It doesn’t feel like an achievement if someone else has already done half the work. I also find that cleaning a source and then building on it is good fun.</p>
<p>Your coder so far has working primarily with the client by the looks. Battlescape is also a lot simpler I find (I like to package my way etc)</p>

Experience in Runescape Private Servers:Ive played rsps for about two years or so before i got into coding them, i coded rsps for about 7-8 monthish and then stopped for a few months, i am back to code another server and are currently looking for a server to help code, i started my own server originally but it failed because i am not good at management, after that failed i played for a bit and made a few friends and my friend started his own private server and i coded it for him, the server was alive for about 6months untill the owner quit and stopped paying for the vps and was shut down, thats when i stopped coding but want to come back to help out another server<br>
Experience in Position Wanted:as mentioned earlier i coded a pretty big server and in it, ive created around 20 quests, my own custom minigame, many unique features that are not in most private servers<br>
Other Comments:not much other than what i previously stated, i am on my computer about 2-5 hours a day and more on the weekend</p>
