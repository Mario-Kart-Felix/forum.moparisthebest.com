    <title>Doctoral Physics Dissertation at Caltech</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/doctoral-physics-dissertation-at-caltech/527367</link>
    <description>Hi there Mopar forums.
I am currently in the process of writing my original Thesis for my PhD in Theoretical Particle Physics, and to say the least, it is one of the most challenging things I&#39;ve had to do in my life. I am writing my thesis based on a new experiment my partner and I have written to try and understand further why light acts as not only a wave, but as a particle as well.
Luckily though, we have an amazing Experimental Physics Department here with extremely highly sensitive equipment that is making our actual testing of the Thesis quite trivial.

I just wanted to share a little about what&#39;s going on with me, and if anyone else has had to present original work for a Masters or Doctorate, what subject where you working in and what topic did you choose?</description>

              <p>Lol stop trying to flaunt fake intelligence. It’s sickeningly. It seems unlikely some newcomer from moparscape, comes and says he was even a student at cal tech. People at caltech aren’t so egotistical that they post on to every forum that they are from cal tech… Nice try.<br>
Btw, I have undergrads as biomedical masters in prawnsografy, and phd in stripping<br>
Princeton, cooper union and MIT respectively. ( I’m so scared to present my thesis about striping) have any of you done a thesis in stripping?<br>
If so please post em<br>
