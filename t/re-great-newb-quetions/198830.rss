    <description>ok this might sound funny but i need tp know what a host is and wat it does
get my no-ip to show up instead of me having to use 0.0.0.0
unlimited access to my server even when im off te computer and its off
auto restart that restarts and saves every 30mins
and the code so every1 can see this Owner Jalapeno842 has jus logged in
and a working pickup command for slipknotscape
and some1 to check to see if they can get on this server ip 0.0.0.0 hopefully itll bring u to my server
which is from the source slipknotscape(i did not leech i even remodeled some stuff and about to do more)

plz answer all my questions

what is dedicated hosting is it 24/7 server online thing


Lagex said this:The ip 0.0.0.0 connects to my server for me. It&#39;s called localhost and only the owner can connect to it.
If owners run their servers, if they try to connect, they need to have a localhost ip or use no ip at all.
If I connect to 0.0.0.0 it goes to my server.
	
how do i get my no-ip to be able to use as that 0.0.0.0 thing so other ppl can use my server</description>

              <p>[quote=“jalapeno842, post:1, topic:198830”]get my no-ip to show up instead of me having to use 0.0.0.0 = make an account at <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and make a no-ip and that logs to your server</p>
<p>unlimited access to my server even when im off te computer and its off = when cpu is off? impossible the run.bat must stay on</p>
<p>auto restart that restarts and saves every 30mins  = some servers download with an auto restarter if voule works for you it doesnt for me i just use windows mouse recorder its more complicated tho</p>
<p>and the code so every1 can see this Owner Jalapeno842 has jus logged in<br>
and a working pickup command for slipknotscape = there is a tutorial for it i could give you but you wouldnt know what to do with it</p>
