    <description>Hello Everyone!

This is a pure survival server. We enforce a close as vanilla possible Minecraft experience with the bonus of a multi-player experience. As a result, RAIDING and GRIEFING are ALLOWED!!!

The server is run by experienced staff who are dedicated to making sure that the server runs well and that all of the players who use it are content. 

But the server does have the twist of the fact that it is what we call &quot;proper&quot; survival. This means that there is no mamsy-pamsy rules against raiding and grieing.... we more adopt the viewpoint of finders keepers.

So come on with your mates and build your empire... dominate the world and show everyone who&#39;s boss!

Minecraft Survival doesn&#39;t get much better than this!

Have Fun,

[TCR] Gaming Team
