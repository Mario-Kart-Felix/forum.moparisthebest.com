    <description>                               (SERVER)
Welcome to the development of Battlezone, We are going to be a nice community with lots of players.We are going to try to get sponserd after we get enough players that we get a vps so no one has to host.
This source/server is pkplanet and going to be turned inside out and modified big time. We will have skill capes with proper 100% emotes, Working d claws that hit x4, some customs not to many or that will ruin economy. Fully working skills ( except construction unless it is possible). 100% combat along with range mage. all GWD bosses. Jad and mabey a few custom bosses. There is so much more that will happen it will take too long to write so im cutting it short.

                                               What We are Aiming For

                               What we are looking for in people
We are looking for people that will dedicate some of there time into the server at least 4+hours a week at the lease not much as there is 7 days in a week. Please if you apply try to spend some time on if you get it. We are also looking for people that will that   are kind and dont back stab or anything polit is a proper word for it and generous.
There is no age limit but We really need mature people for this no 11 year olds that will goof off. although i said no age limit im going to recemend the age most people should be is ----------13+-------------

This is a respectful community if you share any work done here or give it to friends you will be removed.

Beta Tester? We only need 1-2 for now but there will be a beta when we get rolling  but this is for our two main beta testers so apply for it if you know how to find glitches and bugs ect.

----STAFF---
This is something that will not be talked about on the forums as it can be against the rules so when you see the server up(not for a while) go to those forums and look and apply there

              <p>Your going to have to do a lot of programming for that source. I’m sure this is going to take a while, if I remember Pkplanet was removed for malicious coding, twice. Nevertheless, that is up to you to decide. Good luck with the development.</p>

</aside>
<p>Unless I’m wrong, 2 months of coding in Java is nowhere near enough to start developing a server. There’s a lot of complex concepts… concurrency, threading, networking to name a few… that need time to understand. Just a thought  :).</p>
<p>Good luck on your server though.</p>
