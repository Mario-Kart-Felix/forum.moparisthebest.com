    <description>Well, this is completly made to help players who are stuck on a step of making a server to get help by staff and me.. maybe even other players! we also give lists of a few sources, codes and tuts. instead of looking up everything, we can help other players with their server by talking to each other in either our chat box or maybe MSN or AIM if u have either. (i prefer MSN rather than AIM because i am on MSN more) now of course i have to tell you the forum.. MAKE SURE TO SIGN UP! and tell me if u go on and what u thought.. idc what ur answer is.
