        <p>I don’t believe Saddam should be hung at all. Why? Because I’m a Sunni <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smilec164.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>KIDDING!</p>
<p>The real reason I don’t want Saddam hung is that I don’t think its an adequate punishement for all the horrors he has committed. If I was in his shoes I would fear Isolation (A dark room with a bed and a toilet) until death without parole over the death penalty. Death = A prick of pain from the Injection. 30 mins and you sleep forever. Isolation = Held in a dark room for all your life never seeing sunlight or have any entertainment, That is HELL, I would got insane (even more than now) if I got Lifelong Isolation.</p>

You have to put yourself into other peoples shoes. What actually drives someone to become a crazy pshcopathic killer? Clearly if he had been brought up in different circumstances, he wouldn’t have turned out the same.
