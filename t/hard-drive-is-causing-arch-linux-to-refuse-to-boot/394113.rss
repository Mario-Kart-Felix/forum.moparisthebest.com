    <title>Hard drive is causing arch linux to refuse to boot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hard-drive-is-causing-arch-linux-to-refuse-to-boot/394113</link>
    <description>I probably make no sense in this topic, please bare with me.

Basically, as many probably already know I&#39;ve had problems booting arch linux recently, it returned the following error:

There&#39;s definitely a problem with my hard drive...

I did numerous things to fix it however this did not work so I formatted all my linux partitions (boot,swap and root) but the arch linux live cd also returns the exact same error. I&#39;ve ran fsck and chkdsk several times (using another linux live cd and windows respectively) and they reported faulty sectors, so I forced them to fix them and the error is still reported at boot.

So, I pose the question whether the disk should be binned or is there still live in it since windows is happy to boot with it!

ps, it&#39;s a 2.5&#39; 160gb seagate drive from a netbook.</description>

              <p>I should mention it’s a 2.5’ sata drive but it’s in ide emulation mode so the connectors are probably fine. The live cd had no problem booting without the drive in the machine, so I can deduct that it must either be the hard drive itself or the controller. I’ll see if I can grab another drive, stick it in and see the results.</p>

<p>With those definitions, it failed to “READ DMA EXT,” which perhaps means it failed to read direct memory access. This could be an issue with your memory, the hard drive, the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Ata_20070127_002.jpg/500px-Ata_20070127_002.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">connectors</a>, or <a href="http://img.tomshardware.com/us/2002/10/07/ddr400_for_athlon/msi-ata.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">controllers</a>.
