    <title>Character File migrater</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/character-file-migrater/344739</link>
    <description>Since I began programing classes in my local college about 3 years ago. Near the begining of my first semester I created a program that could migrate a character file from one server folder to another, and even from VPS to my desktop computer since I hosted one server on my desktop and 2 on my VPS. Today I am repopening this program and fixing it.
The Problems are:

-Migration take about 5 minutes, depending on character file size
-The program is hard to set-up
-and the many bugs included

I was wondering if anyone was interested in the beta version of this program. I need some people to test it since I don&#39;t have a place to host. In return I will give you the full version of this host migrater. Hopefully if you don&#39;t ruin this...it will be a rare and valueable program.

Things I have managed to fix for the beta:
-Migration now takes about 30 seconds
-the set up is simple (the two servers dump the character files in the same file)
-and many glitches and character file bugs have been fixed.

This program pretty much has never been made. This is a one time chance, I will pick one person to beta test this. Please reply if you are interested!</description>

<p>And for local network file moving, you can just right click the files and press copy, then right click the destination folder and press paste.</p>
