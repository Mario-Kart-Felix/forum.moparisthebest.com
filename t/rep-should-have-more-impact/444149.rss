    <title>--rep should have more impact</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep-should-have-more-impact/444149</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been 200 rep for years now and still if I ever --rep someone it only takes them down 1 reputation, they then ask one of their friends to ++rep them and they gain 13 rep. I know rep means nothing really but it seems foolish to have it at all if it has no advantage.

I think people would think more carefully prior to posting if they thought their rep could be seriously affected. Right now even if 13 people --rep you, you only need 1 single ++rep to be back where you was before. I think ++rep and --rep should increase/decrease the same amounts. :)</description>

<p>We’ll leave this up to discussion with the staff. Although we would normally get back to you on it, it’s probably going to take a while to figure out. In the meantime, I’ll just mark this as resolved.</p>

              <p>Don’t expect any effort to go towards bettering the current reputation system. The majority of people (including staff) are of the impression that it’s pointless, so if it’s going to change it’s probably going to be either completely redone or just removed.</p>
