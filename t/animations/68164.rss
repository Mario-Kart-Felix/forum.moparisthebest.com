    <description>well when lets say someone teleports it causes them to like repeat the animation over and over again, i did a Tut on perfect teleporting but it didn&#39;t work. as well when someone trains on the dummys, doors, it repeats the animation of them attacking the dummies, or the doors, etc. and its really annoying to some people sometimes and as well to me, well if you can help me in this problem i would surely appreciate it =)

source: it was pimpscape, then it just changed to pvpscape lol</description>
