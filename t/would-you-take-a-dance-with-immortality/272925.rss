    <description>Would you ever want to be immortal? 


I would in a fucking heartbeat. I am not scared of death or anything of the sort. And, in a few centuries, I would get over the fact that people I know will die.</description>

<p>The fear of death is just like, if you were a hostage or something and some guy put a gun to your head you’d be like “NOOOOOOOO PLZ DONT KILL ME”, you wouldnt just sit there and be like whatever. I think the only people who dont fear death are like old people and crazy people.</p>
<p>But I dont think Id be immortal. Life would just get really boring and you’d have to have a job for forever unless you won the lottery or something. It would be kind of weird if you made your parents immortal too, but if you didnt youd prolly miss them a lot after they die. The only cool parts would be seeing technology advance so much and having the time to learn anything you wanted.</p>

thats what i thought at first but apparently in this instance you had a selective choice of your bodies age.<br>
Another thing there would be soo many problems with this, back in medievil days woulda been fine but now. Think about it you have birth certificates, drivers licenses and so on. Eventually someone is gonna check a peice of identity you own and see you are xyz years old and you could end up on a scientists work bench</p>

But that’s just bullshit. Old age immortality is not prevented by any scientific laws, we just can’t do it.

<p>So no, I wouldn’t be immortal because I believe old age is there for a reason - to stop your body degenerating of much worse causes like 500 years of background radiation.</p>
<p>If we’re in fairy land and the definition of immortality is to live forever in your current state, I’d love to be immortal. Think of all the knowledge, experience, money and power you could gain. You’d never get bored because as soon as you develop a psychological problem with it you can use 100’s of years of experience to have effective therapy.[/quote]<br>
Meaning by immortality you also mean you don’t take any deadly damage or damage that cannot repaired?<br>
Yes it would be nice, be a superhero since you can take risks other people can’t.</p>

what about age? i didnt think about this the first time round, but its all very well getting as old as time but if you’re body starts to age and gets weaker and your body parts become so weak they can’t support yourself you become a phlid that just sits in a bed all the time<br>
[/quote]Your body would not age. You would remain the same age SELECTIVELY for all eternity.[/quote]<br>
in which case i stick by my original post fuck yeah</p>

aaah warcraft reference :S<br>
but yeah i’d do it, i have come to the terms with the fact that im gonna die and it doesnt really bother me. The only thing that does make me annoyed about death is that im not gonna get the chance to see how technology develops and continue to learn all the new things that will happen. I would just want to stay alive just to see where things lead if the world blew up, which it is likely to do eventually, then yeah we’d probably be on different planets so i could live with that but if the human race became extinct apart from me and there was no equal to it, ie intellectual conversation then i would thoroughly regret this choice</p>
