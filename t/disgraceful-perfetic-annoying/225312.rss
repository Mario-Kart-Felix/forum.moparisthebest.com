    <title>Disgraceful, Perfetic, Annoying</title>

    <description>I&#39;m here to bring up the idea of servers. A private server should be some-what of runescape. I&#39;ve been looking through nowadays sources and they&#39;re horrible. They&#39;re either the same as other sources accept they have different names or they&#39;ve been added a load of jiberish just to make the file look massive and better. The layout of source is also a disgrace for example.

[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;birh&quot;))
                                                          {
                addItem(1561, 1) ;
                                                                sendMessage(&quot;yu gve birh to a bbe&quot;);
                                                                                                          }[/code]

Ok, for a start, the layout. It&#39;s DISGRACEFUL! He can&#39;t even spell!

[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Birth&quot;)) {
addItem(1561, 1) ;
sendMessage(&quot;You gave birth to a new born baby!&quot;);
}[/code]
