              <p>I thought when he said there are character files that he means it is creating new character files when he makes new accounts. OP: post if you get an error in your cmd on logout or login</p>

This happened with a source I was working on for a while, it can be anywhere that this problem is happening, but I couldn’t retrace it, so I just abandoned the source. What revision are you using?</p>
<p>Post your PlayerSave.java to Pastebin and post a link here.<br>

It can’t be anywhere he says the saving is all fine so he should check where it loads his character file.[/quote]</p>

<p>Where does he state that the saving is fine? He says that there’s character files in the data and bin folders, doesn’t mean that it’s saving, it could just be creating files. But yes, if it’s not saving, the next step is loading.</p>
