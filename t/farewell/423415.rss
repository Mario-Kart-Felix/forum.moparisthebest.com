    <description>I Think my time has came, to &quot;grow up&quot; And actually live a life. (not saying i didn&#39;t have one before), its just i think i&#39;m growing up, and i&#39;ve become more and more in-active everyday, due to work and college, 4 days a week working 8 hours a day, and then 3 days in college, and then for rsps. just can&#39;t do it no-more, i&#39;d put my life in front off rsps communitys/rsps. i&#39;ve had a good couple off years here, and met some great people, and some not. :P i&#39;ve learnt alot from moparscape, and some off the people on here, i&#39;d like to wish you all the best in the future, goodluck with school/college, i hope you don&#39;t fuck up school like i did, its really not worth it, i&#39;ll still [i]maybe[/i] be active on a day or two when i&#39;m free.

Peace guys.
 Respect.
