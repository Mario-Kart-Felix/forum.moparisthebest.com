    <description>Ok, I had this for a year and now i think everyone should know :P.

Purpose:A free gameboy and free games (games are seperate dls)
NO virus scan yourself!

Ok first go to www.romsparagba.org

First change the language to english because it&#39;s all in brazilian, to do that when you get on the website on the right hand side there should be a brazilian flag and a amercian flag.(where it says idioma) ok once you have changed it to english Read all the steps and you should have a free gba!!!!!

Step 1: get the gba.

go to the home page or just type the site again. Then scroll down a BIT! and you should see gameboy advance on the right hand side . (first you will see lastest roms then gameboy advance after that. ok now click emulator!!!! then it will say if you want to open or save file .save it to your desktop or anywhere you want it! k now you havee the gba.

step 2: get games!

go to the homepage again and on the right hand side it will say lastest roms above gameboy advance. then click gba.you will see a list of the lastest games (there only the lastest but there r WAY more!!)ok go to gameboy advance on the right hand side. then click top 100. ok now you will see a bunch of games. pick the game you want (name of game on top of all the details)then go to make download it will show things like megupload rapid share etc.!k save the game where ur gba is. now u run the games!!!! open your gba and make the screen bigger. now click file on the top and then click open find the game wherever you saved it and there you go !!! post errors i can fix (or i will try)

End of my short but good tut. (posted here because we have to dl stuff)

Next tut comin out of how to get free nintendo ds!!!!

[code]CONTROLS for THIS:

GBA                                 |                                VBA
