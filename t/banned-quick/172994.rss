    <description>[size=12pt]USE THIS IF YOU WANT TO GET BANNED.[/size]

[size=12pt]If i missed a rule please tell me what rule that was.[/size]

Ok, my second script. A script that will get you banned for saying things against rules. I think i got every rule, but i&#39;m not sure. This will for sure get you banned. If not, you got muted too quick. I suggest not using this script in front of a mod because they will mute you before you get banned  ;). I tried making this as original as possible since a lot of the breaking of rules are the same. I didn&#39;t even look at a autobanner script to make this so don&#39;t tell me i leached. 

This script has many anti-ban features ;). [/sarcasm]

I had this in code, but i made it only an attachment, to see how many people downloaded without replying.

Don&#39;t you just love scripts that you can use daily?

I tried making it sendkeys, but i forgot how to make it press enter after.

Enjoy.</description>

<p>EDIT: By the way, are you the only one that goes on SCAR forums to help people? Your the only person on this forum who has helped me with my scripts and how to make them less detectable/better. Or in this case, more detectable :D.</p>
<p>EDIT:EDIT: P.S nice powercutter, even though i can’t get it to work… 918 lines to chop a tree and drop the logs it chops :P.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 14, 2008, 01:54:17 AM[/size][hr]2 people have downloaded without replying… (once before I separated the scripts and once when I posted this.) This script shouldn’t be good enough for someone to just take without replying a rant :(.</p>
