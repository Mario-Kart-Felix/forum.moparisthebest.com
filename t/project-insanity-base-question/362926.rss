    <title>Project Insanity Base Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-base-question/362926</link>
    <description>Hello, I have started a server with Project Insanity base since I have heard that it is a pretty stable 317 source. I am planning to make an item safe on death no matter what, skulled or not skulled, item prot or no item prot, but since I am so new to this base, I do not know how. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.</description>
