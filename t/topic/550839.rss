              <p>I’m actually going to host this server with Dragonic in which we already have a VPS, and have lots of creative ideas in which we can put into the server. We also have a forum which is already made.</p>
<p>Later updates about the server will be posted here, and the server will be launched quite soon. (Along with the Website URL)</p>
<p>I was having a little think about the Donator shop last night, and was wondering what the community wanted, as I’ve seen you don’t want a Pay2Win aspect, which I totally agree with and that the XP rates should be quite low to make it an achievement to get a 99.</p>
<p>As for the Donator shop, I was thinking of it holding pointless things such as Party Hats, Santa Hats, Costumes, Masks, and maybe with being able to directly buy a custom whip, such as Ice, Dragon, Cyan, Green etc but directly buying those items from the shop would result in it being non trade-able but there also being a way to get the whips for the player community, so people don’t feel pressured into getting donator. However with that being said, it’s going to be difficult to get one of the whips from a boss which we haven’t thought of yet, maybe adding it to an existing boss or creating an entirely new boss, those not being non trade-able and being slightly better/worse than the abyssal whip. Another idea was that it’s kind of like Supply Drops in Advanced Warfare, so there’s different variants of the whips, and some are really good variants (for example the Ice whip and Dragon whip) those having increased stats in Attack &amp; Strength but maybe suffering in the Defence (say that was the Dragon whip) and as for the Ice whip, it could be different in which it has increased Defence and Attack, but decreased in Strength. And as for the lower types of whips such as Bronze, they could have just an increase in one area, but decreased in two areas, for example being increased in Defence, but being decreased in Strength and Attack. (You get the idea) And of-course the ones with the better stats aren’t dropped as frequently as the lower end whips.</p>
<p>Just a couple ideas thrown into a paragraph there, make sure to reply in what you think!</p>

</aside>
<p>Definitely agree with this. 99s are achievable on RS3 with less than a month of consistent play, being generous maybe 14 hours a day. 14*30=420 hours, at 100x it would only take 4.2 hours. That’s not an achievement by any means</p>
