It is an ethnic slur  I would be inclined to say that the racist aspect of a comment like that comes from the intent behind it, rather than the word itself. Some people use words which are offensive, and can taken to be racist, out of innocence and naivity  not understanding the connotations or the impact of the word. It is very possible that this is true of that girl too, and there was no racist intention behind it. 

Animals and wildlife consist of the Scrabs and aforementioned Paramites, both carnivorous predators that are encountered in the burial vaults of Necrum. The Apple III&#39;s software library was very limited, and while sold as Apple II compatible, the emulation that made this possible was intentionally hobbled; thus it could not make use of the advanced III features (specifically 64 KB RAM or higher, required by a large number of Apple II software titles based on PASCAL), which limited its usefulness. He is accused of driving his pickup truck into a nearby market to steal an ATM, but it is revealed that the ATM thief, JD (Anthony Anderson), a cousin of Ricky&#39;s, was actually the one who committed the crime after borrowing Ricky&#39;s truck. 

Of course, it is pity not to bring it to the light for the audience! About Vlad Dracula Impaler everybody knows today that was a cruel person, a merciless impaler, and so on. Did you ever think that he could have been in love? Less people know that Prince Vlad Dracula III had also a romantic side! A Transylvanian Chronicle from XIII century discovered in Brasov town Romania, reveals rare details about the life of Vlad Dracula III during his stay in Brasov region between 14511456. Through other unique information about him, also one refers to a deep Dracula love scene lived with a young beautiful German Saxon girl. 

Upgrades and weapons include the following: motors which help improve speed; tires for better turning; missiles, bombs, and &quot;freeze beams&quot; which help take out opponents; buckshots which steal opponents&#39; cash; and other additional goods such as additional ammunition. In 2004, ASCOM remained formally a reference to the Component Object Model, but the term is expected to stand on its own as new technologies such as Microsoft. Notable features of both games are the use of contextsensitive background music which changes to suit the mood of the onscreen action, and a high degree of interactivity, in that many objects in the first game and nearly every object in the second game can be destroyed.
