    <description>Well I&#39;ve been using Linux for a few days and I don&#39;t see any difference in speed between Windows and Linux. Linux actually takes me longer to load stuff then Windows does. Also, what&#39;s so special about it? Everything just takes a lot longer to do then Windows? I see no gain in Linux whatsoever. Yeah, I can tell it was made for people who are near a computer more often then they are outside. Plus, I installed a game and now my resolution is fucked! I went through three fucking guides and not one of them helped. Well I guess I&#39;ll just trash Linux seeing that it ain&#39;t for me.

Just giving my feedback on this OS.</description>

<p>edit: kamu, that is referred to as shell or CLI, some linux system start into it, and you have to launch the gui manager/server… like slackware distros… once you login you can type startx or startkde… i forgot the one for gnome… its like startgwm or startgdm or something similar…</p>

              <p>Sorry for the very outdated reply, left Moparisthebest for a few months.</p>
<p>I don’t have the time to go through and give an intelligent and thoughtful reply since that would take around 20+ minutes.</p>
<p>@ all the people throwing blows at me saying that it was made for people that aren’t far from a computer - Sorry, not exactly what I meant by that, I was referring to the fact that it’s for people who have a lot of time to waste.</p>
<p>@ xxlegitxx - Yes I was running Ubuntu.<br>
@ Mopar - Vista takes me approximately 48 seconds to load, Linux took around 44 seconds. And the slow program loading was because they were massive, I got an old computer.<br>
@ MasterCheif - My computers fan ran super fast and load at the beginning as well, I just used wipe drive and erased everything on my disk and then installed Ubuntu, was back to normal after that.<br>
@ Schizzo - Yeah for my drives I had to go through such confusing guides and tutorials. One ofthe main reasons I got it was because of all the good things people said about it, after installing it and playing around with it for a few days, MS seemed a lot more welcoming.<br>
@ The Un-Named - I am very computer illiterate, for people like myself it would take a week or two to get anywhere with Linux. Like Schizzo said, it seems overrated. People like you talk about it like it’s cake. Getting errors with Windows is a rare thing you know, with my Vista I haven’t got one error that I couldn’t figure out.<br>
@ Mopman - I didn’t get Linux just because of speed, I decided to try it out because of all the good feedback about it.</p>

              <p>Only 2 minutes? wow my sabayon linux starts up just under a minute.</p>
<p>@ your ‘rant’.<br>
The reason to why I use linux is because of how stable, and fast it is.<br>
Like i said, i use arch linux and kubuntu on one of my computers (i don’t recommend *ubuntu) and this computer i am on now i am running windows vista and sabayon (gentoo based) and windows xp on another.<br>
On windows opening programs seems like such a hard task for it to process (regular windows users won’t notice it, i did not until i started using linux) for example i have noticed running java applets such as deob’d rs clients on windows makes the computer slow right down for a short while and my computer even seems to struggle, but when running the same deob’d client on linux my computer runs and <span class="bbcode-i">sounds</span> fine and starts it up easily.</p>
<p>Also i have only ever had ONE program crash on me since i started using linux and that is compiz-fusion, and it did crash quite a few times but found the problem was i was using an outdated version, updated it now it runs perfectly!.<br>
Anyway the only reason i can see to why the linux distro’s you install run slow on your computer is a hardware problem (although if it can cope with windows it should be able to cope with most linux distros).</p>
<blockquote>Yeah, I can tell it was made for people who are near a computer more often then they are outside.</blockquote>
Yeah ok then, if thats the case then hosting companys, large companys such as ebay, youtube who use linux on their servers simply because it is much much more stable and is less likely to crash.

<p>The fact that you didn’t pay $200 towards it? That you can modify it however you want to? When you buy a computer with windows on it, some money goes to Microsoft, so don’t say you didn’t pay for it, unless of course, it’s a pirate edition.</p>

</aside>
<p>What makes you say that? Just because you tried ONE distribution of it, modified severely, doesn’t mean every distro takes weeks to master. Ok, sure, you’ve had a bad time setting it up so it runs smooth, that’s because it doesn’t support hardware like Microsoft does, it takes a lot of customizing. I’m taking a web design course, and during Tuesdays and Thursdays, I spend a lot of time on a computer with other people that aren’t so computer savvy as me. Windows gives doggy errors(“Would you like to not continue using this …” ect), it doesn’t offer you tips on how to do simple things from moving files to different folders(if you select some files, and drag them to a minimized folder on the taskbar, the folder automatically opens) to simple computer shortcuts etc, etc, sure, it isn’t really confusing stuff now, but if your using a linux distro designed for new people and for specific hardware, it can be easier than windows.</p>
