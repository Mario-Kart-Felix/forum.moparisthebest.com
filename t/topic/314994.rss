    <description>Does anybody know how to change the background image of a 525 client, I have looked through most of the classes as good as I could because most of it is obfuscated etc, and I can&#39;t find how to change the background image. I have seen it done before on one of the 525 client&#39;s but they didn&#39;t release it. Anyone care to point me in the right direction?

Thanks..</description>
