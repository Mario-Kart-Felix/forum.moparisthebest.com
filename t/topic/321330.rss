    <description>Hello Moparscapers Me and a few others are currently working on a pking/staking server but mostly pking, we have added alot to it.

But we are stuck on what els to implant to make it fun as can be, well what im trying to say is we need some suggestions from the community thats you guys to help us make it better all suggestions will be looked at throughout the development, 

we do not have a name yet either we could use help on that to all the good names have been taken or already used and are no longer up
So we need a unique name that stands out.

Why? Because we are freshly out of ideas and need something that will attract new players not that we are trying to compete with other pking servers out there
King pk is the best pking server thats up atm and i respected that eric keeps bringing it back for people to enjoy pking.

Im not trying to be hated by the moparscape community like other currupt rsc private server owners out there im just here to make a server and enjoy the company of the people :D we will listen to the community If you think we&#39;re doing something wrong/stupid, or think that something could be done better, and will continue doing so. I am honest and will always tell the truth and fact and stuff thats going on that will consern the server and will continue growing and continue being updated. so what do you guys think?

If you would to help me out with some suggestions i would really applicate it really much.


Bam_94_4@hotmail.com for any information questions im free most of the day so hit me up if you want to
