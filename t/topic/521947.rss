              <p>Turns out this was a mistake on my end guys, Sno isn’t the owner therefore can’t post the advertisement and I’ve recieved enough proof that Keith/The Djinn/Whatever is the owner of this server. Gonna go ahead and lock it, once again this was a mishap on my end (gonna blame it on being a new mod but that’s just a excuse), sorry.</p>

I've heard people calling it the RSCEmulation killer. He doesn't want it taken down because of Keith, he's clearly just frightened of the high online count.

<p>This advertisement is of Battle-X as a server, not Battle-X as a project of Keith’s.  Keith has NOTHING to do with this.  I provided PROOF that the client was NOT MALICIOUS IN ANY WAY and received permission to post.  Competition is healthy, Pyru, rivalry is not.  Remember that.[/quote]</p>
<p>Once again. The rules state clearly, you may not post an advertisement for a server that you do not own. Furthermore, you’re not allowed to post a server for an owner / operator who has been banned from Moparscape.</p>
<p>Competition and fear? Unlikely. You peak at 10 members online, which I would assume aren’t unique. The same type of server, with the same owner has failed in the past and will fail again.</p>
<p>You yourself just stated that you do not own Battle-X and yet are posting an advertisement for it. If you failed to comprehend which rules you were breaking, when I previously made you aware, I’ll show you again.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s irrelevant, the server is owned by him. The rules should be enforced, as he’s previously condoned in malicious activity and harmed his users. If Moparscape allows an advertisement here for a known scammer (as it is a server he runs and owns) and the same activity were to follow, then they’re at fault for knowingly reinstating the advertisement and directing traffic there, potentially causing more harm on other innocent users.</p>
<p>If a moderator gave you permission, then so be it. I’m just stating my thoughts in regards to the situation. Good luck!</p>

<p>Hopefully the moderator(s) who gave you the permission to re-post, were aware of Keiths history and the severity of his offenses. As stated, you’re advertising for someone who’s been permanently banned from this site, due to the nature of his offenses, which weren’t minor. It may affect your credibility / reputation in the future.</p>

<p>The rules state the opposite, mainly this:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Getting another person to post for a banned members server is strictly prohibited, and will result in a server censorship.</span></p>
<p>There has been proof provided, showing that Keith has not only had malicious content within his servers, but has also scammed people out of money. Regardless, I am not trying to argue with you, and if it stays up so be it. This will just give any other owner who’s been banned from here for similar reasons in the past, a “loophole” to re-posting their servers. It wouldn’t be fair to allow this server to do it and not another.</p>

<p>Contrary to your beliefs, Moparscape isn’t a democracy. Don’t act like you have “rights” to post a server that’s advertisement was removed and who’s owner was banned.</p>
