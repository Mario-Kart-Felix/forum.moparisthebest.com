              <p>[quote=“bengina, post:3, topic:326663”]What service provider (isp) does he/she use?<br>
Does he/she use a router for his/her connection?</p>
<p>Has he/she installed/uninstalled any software within the last 3 weeks?</p>
<p>I have had a few problems like this a while ago they turned out to be 1. my router was blocking access to the port/ip all i needed to do was reset it. 2. My registry was corrupted and was for some reason stopping programes working properly.</p>
<p>Some ips are now blocking ips of copywrited sites/games, p2p software, music download sites, video download/streaming sites… which is a bitch… This depends on location.</p>
<p>Ips that are currently trialing this method that i know of are :</p>
<p>Virgin media - Eng<br>
Be Broadband - Eng<br>
Orange Home Broadband - Eng<br>
Tiscali Broadband - Eng<br>
Aol Broadband. Eng/Usa</p>
<p>These are all in england / usa.<br>
Those are the ones i know of, there may be more.</p>
<p>Hope this helps :D[/quote]</p>
<p>If the use dosn’t have a firewall and they claim that there router is configured correctly then I would strongly suspect that the ISP is blocking the user.</p>
