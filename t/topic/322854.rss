<p>You say that every time to make yourself look like the decent one yet a few days/weeks later and you’re back again. As I said, it’s history repeating itself, but unfortunately the average IQ in on Mopar is lower than 10 so a lot believe your <span class="bbcode-i">constant</span> bullshit.</p>
<p>Proof has been laid on a plate to the Mopar staff yet nothing is ever done but in the back of your mind you think it could well happen so you backtrack and act all nice when deep down you’re utter scum. <span class="bbcode-b">You’re on here for no other reason than to make a quick bit of money off players who trust you. You have no interest in RSC or it’s development what-so-ever, you don’t try to accomplish anything other than a player count so you can continue to make money.</span></p>
<p>When your server crashed and burned to 1 player online (you), you said over and over again that you had changed and will never sell items again (etc). You pretty much begged for players to forgive you both on here and your temporary PunBBHosting forum. A few days/weeks later and you were selling ‘special items’ and then a few more weeks later you had full blown item ‘donate list’ publicly available on your website for people to purchase any item they want for 20$. You admitted that by doing that last time ruined your economy and promised you would never do it again which meant there would never be any more wipes (as you wiped your server 3-4 times in a year), yet here we are again.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t know how you can even defend yourself, if I was in your position I’d crawl up and die because you look like such a utter spastic to everyone else. I don’t understand what you see when you look in the mirror but I assure you, it’s not what everyone else sees.[/quote]<br>
Doesn’t that make you a hypocrite? You posted your character on original runescape classic up for sale, with no interest or use for the game other than to sell your character for real life cash. Now, you are running your own server, which is hosting the same game that the post claimed you were past for years. What was with the sudden change? Did you realize there was money to be made?</p>
<p>In all honesty, I don’t even think Kryptix has the right to post about anyone making money on the side. As most of you know, Kryptix’s past is not a clean one. He scammed/hacked many people for personal gain dispite anyone else’s feelings. He had many methods of getting what he wanted out of people. Everything from phishing(where he owned <a href="http://runescaqe.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescaqe.com</a> AND <a href="http://rvnescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">rvnescape.com</a>) to keyloggers he used to acquire account names and passwords of many unsuspecting users. Oh, did I mention that he also used the keyloggers to acquire people’s creditcard’s to pay for his membership to runescape and whatever else? Anyone who plays Luke’s server is asking to be keylogged by a bound in client one day, and when you buy something online, only to realize the next day your creditcard has been stolen, you will know who to blame.</p>
<p>Go ahead Luke, try and hit back. /flameon<br>

He opened up the donations so the server can still be up, and if anyone wants to donate it’s their own decision. The server needs to be paid for, and if he gets a little extra who cares? It takes time to host a private server and he should get something for it.<br>
All your little rages and essays about Matt really makes you look pathetic, just let it go dude.</p>

              <p>so much for you saying how the new PP2P has changed, and how you can no longer buy items for money. donations for anything in the game is the same thing, same old shit server with shit admins, though i guess most of them are like that, it’s more of the people who play this servers fault for playing it so many times over.<br>

<p>You were a twat in the first place but it’s humerus how Matt claims he’ll never accept donations for items again and then slowly but surely introduces them again until he is full-on selling items as he can’t afford his rent. Now he stoops even lower. It’s history repeating itself but unfortunately followers will be followers and he will always have a line of little puppy dogs walking behind him justifying every move he makes.</p>
