              <p>They’re all pretty much crap. I have a hard time looking at most of them. I can’t say that it’s your fault. It’s GIMP’s. If I were you, the best thing to do now is to get a trial copy of PhotoShop, you probably won’t get any better than you are now with theGIMP. I won’t really go into much detail about each sig, as that would take too long. In general they’re all pretty similar anyways. You didn’t blend the renders AT ALL. And the colors just don’t appeal to me. In the first one the colors are so close, and the quality of the render is so bad it almost blends into this mush. I can’t really look at it without wanting to wince.</p>
<p>OK well, that’s my two cents. I’d also like to mention that in your topic post you said, and I quote.</p>

              <p>Thanks Javis, But about the Tuts thing you got any GIMP tuts too reccomend <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ?</p>
<p>Exe, By “Cheap Effects” I meant I used one brush, A C4D Twice, and a Simplistic Gradient BG, Then used Iwarps, and various other distortions, Too me, I felt that sig was a waste of time, But hey if you “remotely” like it, somethings gotta be right. :o Thanks for criticism.</p>
<p>++ Forgot too add this one;<br>

Friend told me too use that render…</p>
<p>this is why I quit sprites…<br>
<img src="http://i246.photobucket.com/albums/gg92/GMAN7/D.png" alt width="270" height="110"></p>
<p>I could never get it right, Something Always messed up, Soo I started too quit normal GFX and now I do animations… But they’re always blury cuz .gif formatting is crap.</p>

              <p>Ill start from the top and work my way down <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#1:</span><br>
Has potential to be a good sig. the background is fairly interesting. Kind of chaotic but in a good way. Things to improve on our not to include altogether:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would add the renders face on both sides of the graphic again. You want to have a main focal and thats it other wise my eyes wonder around the graphic. You’ll see this said many times on many sites.</li>
<li>Blend the render more. With this i mean the render you put in there isnt sticking with the background very well. There are many ways to make the render blend but i would just recomend reading a tut.</li>
<li>Keep the effects under controll. You have alot of affects in this sig. Almost to many really. ton it down a bit and save some for other graphics.</li>
<li>Gain some flow. Everything is just bunched up. Try adding a lil flow to make the sig look a lil smoother.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span><br>
This graphic would have been 10 times better if insted of a render you used a sprite. In my oppinion that background is begging for a vibrant sprite to be used. things to improve on.</p>
<ul>
<li>try not to whore that text effect to much. In the first sig it looked “ok” in this one it sticks out and doesnt fit the over all flow of the sig.</li>
<li>the left side of this sig just kind of cuts off the over all theme. Theres alot of flames going on all over the background except for a space on the left. Fix that</li>
<li>Choosing the approtiate focal. The render in this oneis alright. It matches the color sceme but personally a sprite would have looked much much better.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hashtag">#3</span><br>
Its a user bar what more can i say. The main part about this one IMO is the animation. It is your focal. In animation you wana make them run a lil smoother. Insted of a 3 layer animation you should have incorperated more layers to make it flow as it moved.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#4</span><br>
One of your best from this group. At the start of the animation it has flow and a good lighting effect is being used. At the end everything works to perfection. The guy even does a different stance when hit which i personally thought was cool. Another good thing is I can tell you put time into this one. Even the ground changes.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#5</span><br>
Render and backroung do not match. This is a key part of any graphic. If they do not match then it just looks bad. The render also isnt blended. There are little to any effects. I can tell you put very little time into this one. Things to improve on</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking more time and putting more energy into every sig to make it the best you can.</li>
<li>adding more effects. The way it looks like he cut the right side is cool but its a novice to first timer effect. Im sure you can do much better granted you read some tuts.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">
</li>
<li>blending like befor.</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Depth</li>
<li>Matching color scemes. Like i said the way the render and the background are complete opposites makes it look just bad.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="hashtag">#6</span><br>
umm where to start. The background is just a gradient. Im sure you can do much better than this. As an over all I am dissapointed. Your spent little time on this one. From what im seeing id say its: gradient background which doesnt match anything with the sig, Lava filter with some of the lava erased, Pasted render, Another pasted render set to overlay and erased. I might not be exact but im pretty sure im close. Things to imrpove on:</p>
<ul>
<li>matching te background with the over all them of the graphic.</li>
<li>adding more effects. Just a lave them isnt an effect. You need to make effects that create flow, depth, and that spice up the graphic. Signatures are based around the focal but one of the biggest parts of a graphic is the effects. Its what makes some one say “Hey thats a really nice graphic” or " Hey thats a peace of  explitive deleted".</li>
<li>blending like said befor</li>
<li>lighting like befor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Over all id say your a novice. Keep working at it and you could be good.</p>
<p>As for exe626 he is one of the best graphics artists that I have personally been rated by and talked to. He knows his stuff. He may of came off as harsh but hey how else will you improve.</p>
