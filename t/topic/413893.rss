    <description>Bet you thought this was another &quot;what do you think is going to happen&quot; type of thread? Well no.

I know how hard it is to believe anything you see on the internet, as it&#39;s mainly one big cesspit of money hungry sharks using every single way possible to coin money out of their good, fellow humans.

Well the 2012 hoax has always made my mind wonder, even frightened me a little bit, because some of it can be so convincing, but I done a small amount of research and found something that may help you sleep a little sounder:

[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lXdcPt66SQ[/youtube]

Watch it all, it will help if you&#39;re worried. I even done some more research on the official NASA website and it all comes back as a hoax: http://search.nasa.gov/search/search.jsp?nasaInclude=2012

Proof that the video is not a fake: http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/2007/morrison.html

^although he&#39;s a little fatter now than in the video.

Hope this helped.</description>

<p>Unless that happens, robots will never be able to take over the world because the whole processor thing, wich is the core of any robot, is just designed in a way to execute commands it is given. If you knew how a processor worked, the ALU,… you would know how stupid computers really are (this was for the newbs). In other words, a processor (robots core) is just a tool. And a tool has to be combined with intelligence to be dominant. And since the only intelligence we have on earth, that we are able to control, are our own minds, robots themselves won’t be able to take over. I don’t think humans will ever be able to create electronical artificial intelligence without using biological elements. Ofcourse, I’m talking about processors now, you could say make the software in a way to make it think and such. My answer to that is that the software gets adapted to it’s architecture and since the design of the most advanced architecture is built for something that is not thinking but doing, software can not be written for thinking but doing.</p>

Or you can add another piece of hardware that commands the processor, and has thought capabilities ^.^</p>

No, the world is not going to end in 2012.<br>
Sure, there are some earthquakes and hurricanes every now and then. That doesn’t mean the end of the world is near. It’s hurricane season and we got a hurricane. You’ve got to be shitting me if you think it’s a sign due to a non-existent end of the world.</p>
<p>Remember ‘Judgement day’? March 23, 2011 or something? Was that real? No. Will 2012 be real? No. If anything, the world is most likely to end from war. One side of the war is going to get completely fed up of the fighting and use some kind of a bomb and destroy life. Read that from a guy who predicts shit and died a long time ago. He says the world will end in 3000 from war.<br>

<p>Robots do exist. Nothing that’s special about them/major yet.</p>

Having to live off what the world already produced, no companies making twinkys. God it would be awesome, all the gas in the world left to drive around in a hummer and all the ammo the world has produced. Burning piles of money as fire kindle because it holds no value. &lt;3</p>
