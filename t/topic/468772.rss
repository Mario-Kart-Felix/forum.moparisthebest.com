<p>Thanks for the advice, I will try to implement these into the server as soon as possible. There are a lot of things I haven’t finished yet, but I did fix a lot of bugs and mem leaks. There are so many things that I’ve done to the server that I don’t think I could possibly remember them all and I never made a list I just fixed things and added things as I went.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why you should keep a Developmental Log. Doing this not only helps to show others that you’ve indeed put work into your Base, but it also helps to keep you motivated. It still isn’t too late for you to list what you’ve done as well! You can label them under something such as “Past Updates” for instance. You can also use them to keep track of things, stored Backups, correct Caches, etc. Here’s an example of one:</p>
<blockquote>Key: SS = Server-sided, CS = Client-sided Developments
<p>Past Updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Player V.S. N.P.C. Combat removed from the Base. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server contents packaged. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40 new folders created in total. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Client class reduced to 184K.B. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a recreation of the 289 Revision’s Prayer Tab. (CS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player to Player Trading has been removed. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text Method optimized for grammar purposes. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Debugging methods added. (SS/CS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player to Player Following has been removed. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All Scroll-Bars have been removed. (CS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magic Tab cleaned out for the Tzhaar Magic Tab. (CS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Potions and other UseItem Packet content has been removed. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Player Death has been removed. (SS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fishing, Crafting, Mining, and virtually all non-combat Skills have been removed. (SS)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks. I am going to create a system where it randomly gives you a cheap item once every few minutes so after a while your inventory will eventually be full and you can no longer thieve from the stall if your inventory is full. I’m not sure how well it will work or if it has already been done but oh well.[/quote]</p>
<p>You should make them Items which they can use High Alchemy on to make a little bit more Coin, and lower the current amount the Stalls add. Doing this will help to balance out the “Time V.S. Reward” factor. One Item every few minutes sounds a little bit too slow to me. At the current rate, they’ll have plenty of Coins per trip. Unless that’s what you want of course.</p>
<p>More small advice:</p>
<blockquote>having all of these items in the skilling store ruins an economy as well</blockquote>
<p>You should include the Default (starter) Skilling tools in the Player’s Bank when they create a new account. Place your other Starter Items there as well.</p>
<blockquote>-thieving stalls you don't auto face the object while thieving</blockquote>
<p>Are you familiar with your Woodcutting Methods and System? You can use the same turnObject (or whatever the Name may be) which it uses.</p>

<p>-agility is spamfest for xp<br>
-thieving stalls you don’t auto face the object while thieving<br>
-when you dont have the thief level to pickpocket a npc instead of telling you it just makes the pickpocket fail/make you take damage</p>
<p>suggestions:</p>
<p>-your going to ruin the eco by making it so you can auto click stalls all day to be honest… it just gives gold from what I see (10k for first and 15k for next, haven’t gotten level for next one )<br>
-change that gameframe it’s hideous<br>
-having all of these items in the skilling store ruins an economy as well, you should totally make those herblore ingredients be like monster drops or something ( hell make it stuff you can thieve for!)</p>
<p>for the most part, is it a leech? I wouldn’t call it a full blown out leech but you can still tell the original base is insanityx/ pi based.</p>
<p>I will say this though your trying and for that I do have to give you at least a little credit.</p>
<p>Couple of other items</p>
<p>-BE CREATIVE, hell make it so chaos druids are like a thieving npc or something instead of something you fight ( to be skiller friendly ) etc etc.<br>
-Before you release a piece of content make sure you test it extensively for dupes, bugs, facing, make sure the set ticks/events work as they should, make sure it works as it should.<br>
-Get feedback from your players. I can’t stress this enough, get a ::suggestions command so people can suggest stuff if you don’t. Then you need to focus on gaining feedback for new ideas and base your development from that. Don’t just add “the same old crap” make it unique something you don’t see on other servers.</p>
<p>rating: will be nice and give it a 7/10 for trying.</p>
<p>p.s.remove those sprites from cc/summon tab they ruin the concept and quite honestly you aren’t fooling anybody with that summon sprite add the real interface with it showing the monsters or whatever.</p>

It’s hard for the community that we’re in, and with a server with these features that are flawless very few could add them perfectly, T_R being one of them.<br>
I’d learn to take criticism kid.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to give you feedback and comment on your Media. Everything listed comes standard in a Matrix Base. Surely if you program as well as you say, you must keep a Log to store your Developments and endeavours? Post that so people can see that it has actually had some work put into it.<br>

<p>Just the comments I expected from this community. Anyhow, no it’s nothing like Matrix and it’s not even the same revision. If you logged in and checked it out you can’t even compare the 2. If you just assume that people can’t code then why don’t you take a look at the damn server before leaving a reply that is bound to steer people away from my post.[/quote]<br>
What steers people away is the bold letters at top saying that media isn’t here yet.<br>
Lists of stuff come with every base, they’re not hard.</p>
