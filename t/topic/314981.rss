so much fail, figure it out yourself like everyone else.<br>

Erm, define ‘everyone else’? Bugs are very easy to not notice, hence why BETA testing was invented. Zilent could completely re-build the source and forget to patch up something he didn’t know was a problem, I’d much sooner ask a few (helpful) people on here and get some knowledge on the common RSCD bugs. If you’ve got nothing constructive to say why even bother posting?</p>
