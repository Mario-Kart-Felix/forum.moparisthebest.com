Rajasthan had got through 27 overs at the end of the third day but still had another whole day to survive, after Karnataka had managed a 368run firstinnings lead and made them follow on. The top order saw out the first two sessions but in the final one Karnataka&#39;s seamers picked up four wickets within eight overs to set up a tense finish.
