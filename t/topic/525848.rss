<p>Chrix moderator at this server = avoid</p>
<p>My legit char ‘Gibbs’ was banned on projp2p for autobuying arrows. I had not noticed him calling for me when buying the arrows. He banned me claiming i  had autoed for weeks. Later on when the staff unbanned all banned accounts, it was revealed that gibbs had public chat block off, and 50 arrows and bolts in inventory.</p>
<p>Chrix was ignorant, didnt make even the smallest effort to really see if the ban was an error. GG avoid plz</p>

<p>I support Rubys cleanup, and as said before I have bad feedback for this server. The reason being it has had relatively no updates and allows the sell of party hats (from Pyru) for 80$ in which the money goes to his bank account, now who does that remind you of? Anyone remember Matt from PP2P, well Luke(Kryptix) myself and at first Tommy(Gawdz) decided to make RSCE in order to put PP2P out of business due to Matt selling party hats for irl money eventually taking in a large player base which we took away from him with the promise of NO ITEMS TO BE SOLD FOR GAIN. Now basically all Pyru is doing is ruining Lukes dream (well all 3 of our dreams) and is making a mockery of the RSC community.</p>
<p>What happened with Matt from PP2P and PP2P itself? This community admins/mods deleted its thread and got rid of Matt for selling virtual goods for his own benefit about 3-4 years ago… what is Pyru doing? The same… it makes me sick this thread is still up as well as the server.</p>
<p>Discuss.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Chrix,</p>
<p>Relatively no updates? Oh, since taking ownership, I’ve dished out updates pretty much weekly. There has been countless bug fixes, changes and implementations, including new landscapes, quests, wilderness changes, a mini-game, IP Limitations and much more. I am not sure what you would classify an “update” if those aren’t considered by you.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The sale of hats, is to fund the server.</span> The money doesn’t go to me so quit making false accusations. The method in place to re-sell hats, in no-way, shape or form hurts the community or economy. The hats are all taken from banned accounts, which are still technically in “circulation”.  I destroy 80% of the hats, if they have multiple and <span class="bbcode-b">offer the other(s) up for donation</span>.</p>
<p>From what I gather, you sell GP for IRL cash, so it’s quite hypocritical for you to post this rant.</p>

<p>He isn’t selling anything through his site and isn’t advertising his donation system (merely defending it) so there’s really nothing I can do with that. Sorry.[/quote]</p>

<p>Though, nothing will be done about it, because the staff members don’t seem to respond to PMs.</p>
<p>Anyway, it doesn’t matter what is being done, currently, on a server that was banned from advertising. It’s banned, and isn’t allowed. End of discussion.</p>
