<p>A timer <em>IS</em> a different thread…[/quote]<br>
More than aware of that. If it didn’t it would still pause the program, figured that was a given, sir<br>
If he were to be making his own implementation, he would quite literally be making his own timer rather than using the one provided. That’s illogical as it literally has no advantage and would require more work on his end.</p>

I think you’re beginning to forget how shitty of a programmer you really are. You’re stepping a bit out of your place lately. You have absolutely no programming knowledge nor do you have a reason to be acting like such an ignorant douche.</p>
