Boo hoo. Old news. Heard it all before when I was a kid with a radio or a TV screen, dumb young kids drive and die, going too fast to show their ass, lessons unlearned, whining at makeshift shrines, lighting candles and letting loose balloons, doing their best to compete in compassion contests. 

No TRUE Christian is extremist, racist, doesn&#39;t hate Jews, doesn&#39;t blow up abortion clinics. That&#39;s like me standing in front of the White House and claiming to be president. I can say it all day long but that will never make it true. In the sense of the above made remarks, I am quite optimistic about the new VS3. I am sure it will find its customers among the common, less pretentious users, who are looking  at the same time  for something more than just a &quot;common&quot; mobile phone. Let&#39;s hope, however, that this time Panasonic will get free from its bad habit to kill its mobile products with high prices already at their birth. 

It may be somewhat biased towards her and idolising her life, but otherwise provides plenty of good information. I would not recommend using this source if you were writing an assignment, but it is good if you want a brief overview of her life. However, if you were looking for information on her war decorations, this would be the website to use.. 

Paul&#39;s association with racist newsletters is a serious moral failing, and even so, it doesn&#39;t save us from making a fraught moral judgment about whether or not to support his candidacy, even if we&#39;re judging by the single metric of protecting racial or ethnic minority groups, because when it comes to America&#39;s most racist or racially fraught policies, Paul is arguably on the right side of all of them. His opponents are often on the wrong side, at least if you&#39;re someone who thinks that it&#39;s wrong to lock people up without due process or kill them in drone strikes or destabilize their countries by forcing a war on drug cartels even as American consumers ensure the strength of those cartels. It&#39;s perfectly legitimate to criticize Paul harshly and point out the horrible aspects of his belief system and past actions.
