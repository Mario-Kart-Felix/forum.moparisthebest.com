<p>EDIT: this server failed because of the lack of xp rate, player event inactivity and lack of updates/fixes implemented. Ideas/suggestions were either disregarded or not implemented because Nemesis doesnt have the skills. Last client update was 17/6. You have 3 topics in your ‘UPDATE’ section yet there is 100+ topics in your bug reports/suggestions sections (and some topics are multiple bugs/suggestions)</p>
<p>AND Nemesis is one of the worst admins to ever run server/s.<br>
[/quote]<br>
First of all, the experience rate is about 3x what StorkPK had. It’s good for long run. The players that complain about it are very minor part of the community.</p>
<p>I don’t lack the knowledge of doing the updates. I haven’t kept my players up to date what I’ve fixed and what I haven’t. I’ve fixed all the bugs that have occured. About ideas/suggestions, there hasn’t been much ideas/suggestions that would be good, but I’ve implemented every idea that has been somewhat good.</p>
<p>I do agree that there hasn’t been any good updates, but that’s simply because I haven’t came up with any good ideas.</p>
<p>In short: Go trash talk somewhere else.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hows Stork going you retard? Go trash talk somewhere else, like you do in every other server topic? Just admit you lack the skills\ability\knowledge\smarts to run a decent server, you’re 16 years old and try to get some money every few months. Just give up already kiddo everyone in this community hates you.</p>

<p>Cant handle server criticism? You go somewhere else.</p>
<p>Jauro, Tob3 gave the dedi access to DSL (there is apparently video proof) annd Jut banned tob3 for it. After that Nemesis went ahead and ip banned Jut. This wasnt the only person that had/has the dedi access as well. Nasty had it. Also, Nemesis let tob3 bot on his server just because he was a mod. Jut had told him several times that he was autologging. I personally had killed him a few times and watched him sit in bank autologging. THese are big failures of you being an admin Nemesis. Also, having Crooks as apart of the team and doing what he did can not be blamed on anyone else but Nemesis’ decisions as an admin.</p>

<p>I checked the logs and nobody had accessed my dedicated server except me.(Since the crooks accident) Jut was banned and demoted for massbanning about 60+ players. Nasty had dedicated server access for a while, and I can trust him, but I decided to keep the access to myself only.</p>

<p>don’t know why this isn’t closed yet, nemesis is a child, lets people bot when they threaten to ddos, tob3 threatened to ddos got admin and db access… they let db stay open for like 1 day… thats their fault, and your fault for playing this crappy server. i got demoted from forum mod for telling nemesis he was corrupt and letting botters go free because they threaten to ddos.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s only what rumors say, and obviously, they aren’t true.</p>
<p>Tob3 never threatened to DDoS, atleast from what I know, and I’ve never heard that he would have used a bot… I’ve been slacking for a week or two, so I haven’t really talked to him for a while. I don’t even know what happened with him.</p>
<p>Nobody else has had dedicated server/database access than me, like I’ve said before. And you know that you didn’t get demoted for what you said you did. You got demoted for being immature, you didn’t get in-game mod so you went all mad and you’re still butthurt about it.</p>
<p>The server is still up and going because some players have faith on me instead of being naive like you. You believe everything you hear.</p>
<p>But let’s get back on the topic, shall we?</p>

        <p>Nemesis is what you call gutter trash. This guy never keeps his servers up for long. This server will be down in a week once people realize how much of a damn idiot he really is. Having played on probably his first server (nemesis online, it used demonik source if i remember correctly) I can vouch at how much of a tool this guy really is. It’s funny how he tries to defend himself when everything being said about him is 100% true.</p>

<p>hahahahaha whats funny is anyone had datbase access you dumby the database was left open when you freakin were offline for like 5 hours… i got in there buddy… i seen the little md5 hash which you can just go to md5 decrypter and get it decryted and scam everyone… you are a horrible admin server is a fail, you need to get some hair on your testicles and come back and try again with less of an attitude and more of the serious mentality. If you took it seriously, and knew how to run a server you’d have a successful server a lot of people love stork, but you ruined it by letting botters go, taking no suggestions seriously from players.</p>

<p>And thats what u did, i saw it <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Btw, holy shit how much trash talk i see here about/for panu… servers doing good, still having 30-60 online. bugs gettin fixed daily etc… if you dont like the server, cuz panu is admin, login and u might like it…</p>

        <p>I liked Panu when we first started chating, replied to me everytime, modded me after i showed him my experience, forum mod anyways… then he totally ignored me, one day i said “how am i doing” he said great keepin the forums in line, of course when you delete spam on the forums and such no one on forums will like you when your deleting their posts 24/7, then he opened staff apps, how am i going to get +1s, when its all the people i delete spam from haha… anyways from then on out i got like 3+ 1’s and like 5-7 -1’s and then he ignored me from then on out, i deleted the app and asked him if i was getting it or not, and i explained no one would like someone who deletes their spam etc… Their forums were a mini forum of rscemulation, none of their mods delete forum spam either, i know before i try out a community/server, i check the forums, and when there is spam/flame i usually don’t join, unless i know some people there. These rs2 kids read these forums and go back to rs2 becasue your lack of professionalism on the forums (dunno if thats a word) <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
