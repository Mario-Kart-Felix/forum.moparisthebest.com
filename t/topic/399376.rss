<p>hey! I didn’t destroy everything. When I got there, there were just a lot of broken walls and floating blocks… And one of those watch towers was gone too. I just broke whatever building had been heavily griefed (I would have simply fixed said heavily griefed buildings, but it was impossible to make out how they originally looked). I thought it was abandoned (seeing the crappy condition of everything but a few structures and the wall). How was I supposed to know it wasn’t really abandoned?</p>

<p>I support this statement, if something is already griefed beyond recognition and no report and such has been posted on it, it should be assumed that the structure has been abandoned and given to whoever wants to do with it as they wsh.</p>
