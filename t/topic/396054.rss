nope, the web browser would be restricted from running any kind of executable, and you can’t even do anything like that with HTML because it is nothing more than a markup language.</p>

if it isn’t signed it wouldn’t ask permission it just wouldn’t fucking run, learn how the JVM works you fucking moron. there is no "unlegit’ way to sign a fucking java applet, the jdk comes with a signing tool and you just use it, dumbass.<br>
seeing as java drive-by is something that was coined by some stupid faggot on hackforums (which is a site full of moronic teenage skiddies like yourself), you are a fucking skiddie.</p>

<p>like u can use java and javascript interactively, idk if mixing them together would make it were a signed applet would have access to ur computer(meaning having a javascript thing make it where it allows the java applet to have access). this is a like to a similar virus that i was talking about idk if its the exact one im talking about: <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-fake-microsoft-security-essentials-alert" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-fake-microsoft-security-essentials-alert</a></p>
