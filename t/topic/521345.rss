The Icon stays on mine for the preview and opening, but it goes away afterwards. I think I do recall it staying on the whole time on one of my Funimation DVD&#39;s, though. Very poor design on Phillips for that part. On track  attracted people from all over the country you know some of the best in the world runner. It&#39;s just a shame to see  go. That&#39;s being  rock on man that is real. 

Tough to say. ON the one hand, demographics such as where whites, blacks and Hispanics live isn&#39;t really a good indicator of racism. People CHOOSE to live in those areas for a number of factors: type of living quarters offered, type of amenities offered in the surrounding neighborhood, price, etc. 

&quot;I was picked up by a 40foot wave and pushed 800, 900 feet,&quot; he recalled, gently rocking on an old wooden chair salvaged from the towering debris piles nearby. &quot;It just wasn&#39;t my time to go. It was a ride I&#39;ll never forget though. Change needs to occur more frequently like that. We make change all the time, but what does it change? Going to the gym changes my appearance, but do I ever question how it changes me? Going to church changes my desires, but do I ever question how it changes me? I do not often enough. I am so busy changing that I am constantly missing the point. 

I agree, the jury got played by Cobbins family. I can&#39;t believe that the depravity of these crimes did not constitute death with this jury. Cobbins family hadn&#39;t seen him in years. But I suggest that the lack of lucidity is consistent with the entire storyline and as Cobb says to Saito (Ken Watanabe), part of the selfreferential nature of the film was that there were dreams. I will say that I think Ariadne (Ellen Page) brought up some interesting ethical dilemmas that were quickly glossed over in the film, but then again, I don expect a deep philosophical treatise or indie film from Chris Nolan, but a visually stunning action film that has more of a story than the usual banal dreck that we have to sit through. And I think he delivered with &quot;Inception.&quot;.
