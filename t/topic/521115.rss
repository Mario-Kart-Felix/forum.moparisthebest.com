<p>Keith’s servers had some good pking, but that was long long time ago, i dont really even know why he has released the last replicas of his server, turning a pk server into skilling made player base drop baaaad. Last time it got opened, they just did it to get Emu players info, so they could steal their banks and sell for $ and its a fact. lol.</p>

<p>Do I need to state it again, or did you miss it the first time? Because I post a few times here or there, doesn’t make me “active”. I still don’t care for Mopar, but that is besides the point here. As I previously said, you probably contacted a staff member regarding Keith advertising a week ago and still nothing has been done, these boards are rarely moderated.</p>
<p>Don’t worry secret agent CodeForFame, if it isn’t the last server he launches, you’ll have much more work ahead of you!</p>
