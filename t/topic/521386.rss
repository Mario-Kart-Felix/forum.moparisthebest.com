Issues are discussed such as the religious fervor, theocracy, the importance of reputation, and even the town&#39;s problem with land disputes.

Doctorow, Chuck Close and John Ashbery. Forster among others, titled his speech &quot;Rock n&#39; Roll,&quot; a title and concept he swears he thought of before learning that Dylan had been elected. To laughter, applause and a few frowns, he shifted from tributes to such &quot;exuberant&quot; poets as Frank O&#39;Hara to boyish pleasure over passages from Dylan, Dire Straits, the Ramones and the Doors.
