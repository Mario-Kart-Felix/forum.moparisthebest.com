<p>“It’s not difficult terrain and it’s a beautiful site.” The city has worked hard in recent years to revive the 75acre nature center, which had fallen into overgrown neglect in the mid1990s. Students from have helped refurbish its field house, and volunteers join in an annual trailclearing day in April to give the place a spring cleaning. Ogno, who used to teach at , is now retired and has the time to serve as the center’s director.</p>
<p>But RBS said today that Hester would not be taking the shares after all. “I can confirm that he has decided not to accept the bonus,” an RBS spokesman told AFP. The fact that the sum was less than half the 2m Hester was given a year earlier had failed to dent the criticism…</p>
<p>In some high schools and elementary schools, shot put, parallel bars and even swing have disappeared from the playground due to ‘safety concerns’. The vice principal of a high school in Jiangsu told Xinhua that though the sports meets are held annually, they are compressed into one day, and there are fewer events over the years. “Actually, the shot put balls have been left there untouched for years,” he said…</p>
<p>Still, I think you should stay right where you are for now, and keep paying your rent on time like normal. Keep the lines of communication open with your landlord, too. I’d also contact the mortgageholder, and tell them about your situation in this house.</p>
<p>The chief minister warned the officers against a delay in resolving the problems of the masses, asking them to perform their duty honestly. Meanwhile, Rehmat Elahi with her family members complained that her 9marla plot had been occupied by Ghulam Fareed Bhutta, an influential landlord, at Umarpur Janobi, Wasandaywali. The chief minister ordered the Muzaffargarh DPO to retrieve the plot and take action against the squatter…</p>
<p>(Newer models use a different battery that has not drawn similar complaints.)So the Road Worrier wondered: Is this a general complaint among drivers of aging hybrid cars?Judging from all the Prius testimonials that poured in, apparently not.“As one of many very satisfied Prius owners, I would appreciate not being lumped with the unfortunate Honda hybrid drivers,” Judy Schneider of Garner said by email. "I have (66,000) miles and still get an average of 50 mpg."Prius drivers are about saving gas, and they seem to fall into two groups. There are socalled “hypermilers” who sometimes go to extremes to keep their fuel economy well above 50 mpg.“It’s all really about embracing the philosophy of the car,” said Tom Evans, 70, of Pittsboro.</p>
