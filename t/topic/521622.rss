Atwater: You start out in 1954 by saying, &quot;Nigger, nigger, nigger.&quot; By 1968 you can say &quot;nigger&quot;  that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states rights and all that stuff. He even admitted that a couple of years ago in an interview for the woman&#39;s page of the London Independent, in which he said he was now a parody of himself. And he also said in that interview that he hated taking holidays. The exact quotation is: &quot;The problem I have with holidays is you go and waste two weeks of your life sitting on a bloody beach. 

(Although some things will surprise everybody since they&#39;re completely unmotivated and seem to come out of nowhere.) The cases in this volume are mostly complete with the mangaka adding to the intrigue with hints on Otonashi&#39;s dismissal from the force. And, of course, there is the matter of necrophiliac (purported), photographer and cowboy, Shoei Kodama, a shadowy figure who has designs on the person and/or life or Otonashi. Youka Nitta tantalizes the reader with this character and his motives for pursuing Otonashi. 

The change in leadership failed to prevent the overwhelming defeat of the Progressive Conservatives in the elections of October, 1993. The Liberal party, headed by Jean Chrtien, gained a parliamentary majority and formed a new government. The Reform party, a rightofcenter party, and the Bloc Qubcois, a separatist party, also gained a significant number of parliamentary seats.. 

I am finding ShangriLa to have a nice pace as the last couple episodes have done a good job giving us just as much information about the world that we need to know, while leaving the rest to figure out, and at the same time raising new issues which raise the stakes that everybody is fighting for. Kumiko is continuing to get drawn farther into the conflict than she would like, but we are now starting to see the seeds of her open involvement with Metalage against the Atlus government. I mentioned in the review that this seemed to have some similarities with Last Exile, and I am really starting to see them now, and not just in the artwork remains a high point of ShangriLa.
