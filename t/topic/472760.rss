              <p>To come from a different perspective than most of the other posts so far, I would say look for other large Catholic families that you and your family can “hang out” with.  My wife is pregnant with <span class="hashtag">#6</span> right now, and many of our closest friends have 7 or more.  Not only does it make it enjoyable to have other kids for our kids to play with, but the interaction between my wife and her friends I think makes it easier for her to deal with going through so many pregnancies on her own.</p>

<p>I agree with what you have said and understand the marital debt the same way. We don’t know the reason why the wife does not want anymore children right now. Her reason may be grave. Until we know for certain, I wouldn’t assume that her reason is without merit, but we don’t have that information. Also, though it may be advisable, I do not believe that it is required to get approval from a priest to use NFP. Obviously, if you are unsure, or there is a disagreement or confusion on grave matters - yes, consult a priest, but I don’t believe it is actually required.[/quote]With the way you interpreted the OP’s quote, I understand the conclusion you came to, these things cannot be taken lightly.</p>

Good point. vortex, is your wife willing to talk to a priest about this? Not only is she committing mortal sin, but she is making you sin as well.<br>
[/quote]<br>
How do you know that the reason his wife has is not a valid reason for a periodic abstinence? Not wanting to have more children can be a reason for abstinence if the reasons are grave. You are accusing his wife of committing a mortal sin without knowing all the facts. The only fact we do know, is that the OP is considering committing a mortal sin.[/quote]I think the issue is not the desire to space children but the pulling out early.  Unless I am very mistaken, this is a mortal sin since it perverts one of the two major reasons for sexual intimacy in marriage.  Since the wife is specifically requesting that her husband do this, she is not only sinning herself but encouraging him to sin as well.</p>

Okay, here goes. I have quite a situation that I need help with. My wife is not wanting more children right now (we have four), so the only way we can have relations is if I don’t “finish the act,” if you will. Yes, I’m talking withdrawal. It’s killing me because I don’t want to have mortal sin on my soul, yet I also believe in “happy wife, happy life.” I feel that she’s being selfish and not trusting God. Sometimes I try to convince myself that it’s not a mortal sin on my part because I want to do what’s right and it’s not my desire to sin. We’ve tried abstinence, but it doesn’t work for me. And please don’t start hitting me over the head; this is difficult enough as it is.</p>
<p>[/quote]Homosexuals are required to abstain.  If the Church can ask them to do it, anyone can.  If abstinence “doesn’t work for you” then it’s not because it’s too difficult, it’s because you don’t love God as much as you love sex.[/quote]What a ridiculous response. You’re trying to compare homosexuals to a MARRIED man. A married man is not required to abstain. His wife cannot deny him the marital debt without a very good reason, and without speaking to a priest first. Not wanting to have any more children is not a reason to abstain. What is the purpose of marriage, after all? To tell this man that he doesn’t love God enough is disgusting.</p>
