It is important to note that while the statute mentions 24 hours as being presumed to be reasonable notice, it is a presumption only. A legal presumption is one of those rare instances where the court is entitled by law to start of with a predisposition about a case.

This layout would be in case of drum boiler, used in small power plants (electric power output not more then 100MW). Now the drum is large barell on top of the boiler where water and steam are separated. In case of large MW rated power plants the boiled does not have a drum.

Sugar milling in Queensland is now 60 per cent foreign owned. There was no similar campaign led by Senator Joyce over these acquisitions.
