Why not stop with the suggestions and actually make it? a interface ingame would be the best. command =  uhly… what kryptix did is probably the best option of changing passwords atm.</p>

Eh, the above will (and does) work absolutely fine. At the very best I should have maybe included isset() but it will still work fine.[/quote]</p>

              <p>I have looked into many different ways of securing clientside registration and the way i have done it was to create a creation stamp when a player registers, ive also added a client side ui when a player presses F7 ingame which shows a players info eg - Username, password, creation date, creation Ip and their current Ip. When a player first logs in a random question is asked and i currently have 200 different questions that could be asked- the player can select one of the options given(choose from 5 different answers) and this then saves to the creation stamp and acts as a secret question password.</p>
<p>The creation stamp just logs a players details into a seperate file- When a new player is trying to be created it checks the files for IP’s and if one matches checks the creation time and date to see if a player can make a new character and if one has been created within 24 hours doesnt allow the registration - i know this way takes longer and the creation stamp wasnt really needed but it seemed the best and easiest way to do it.</p>
<p>Also i have a field in the client startup for changing passwords, Enter your details normally using your current username and password then click the change password option instead of the ok button- it will take you to another screen asking for your secret password, when enterd correctly it will bring up the option to change your password, when entered incorrectly it logs the player out and puts a false mark in the creation stamp, If the player gets 3 false marks and the player tries again with an incorrect password it changes their password to a random one and logs them out so they can no longer log in.<br>
I am having help with doing this as their are a few bugs that i have and the ui looks a little horrible atm but it should be working properly within the next few weeks.</p>
<p>I think this is probably the best way to do it without the need for a website and mysql… Correct me if im wrong.</p>
