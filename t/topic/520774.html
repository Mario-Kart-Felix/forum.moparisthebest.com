        <p>petrol, the Government has deregulated diesel from its control and has allowed oil companies to hike prices from time to time. This is a saddening and antipeople decision which will hurt the poor, the middleincome group and farmers in the coming days, she told a press conference.She said the decision to increase the cap on LPG cylinder from six to nine was not sufficient.She alleged that the hike in rail fares and diesel prices shows that the Congressled Government only proved that Congress hand (its election symbol) not with the poor but with the rich and capitalistsIn a word of for the Congress, Mayawati said the ruling party should introspect on issues of public interest, law and order and matters related to country borders at its ongoing shivir at Jaipur.In reply to a question, she said the Government was taking major decisions before the Budget session as it wanted to avoid Parliament. They may announce some incentives for the common man and later it is possible that they may dissolve the Lok Sabha, she said.are giving them (UPA) a full chance to do wonders now.</p>
<p>After seven consecutive months of declines, a 22 percent jump might be worth taking seriously. But but as we learned here almost three years ago new housing start data includes two main components, single family homes and multifamily homes (apartments, condominiums, etc.) And the data on multifamily homes are notoriously volatile.

<p>One guiding principle for Sunday from the earliest days has been to give special emphasis to Australian films. The first film I reviewed on the very first program was Bruce Beresfordâ€™s Puberty Blues, which broke new ground and was hugely popular. Mad Max II also appeared during those first months and was bracingly controversial.</p>
<p>I say this with the acknowledgement that unless we can promote intellectual growth in our youth, the system will certainly fail, in spite of its great intentions. As parents, the bulk of the responsibility falls to us. It will take time, probably an entire generation.</p>
<p>This makes it extraordinarily difficult to reconstruct the lives of the first Australian. But one archaeologist hopes to fill in some of the historical gaps by taking a new, much closer look at Aboriginal artefacts. He analysing the glue used in ancient tool in the hope that it could reveal the existence of long forgotten Aboriginal trade routes.</p>
<p>Atwood describes these novels as speculative fiction rather than science fiction, arguing that her tales are speculations on the dangerous directions being taken by our current societies. These novels about the future are not about intergalactic space combat or otherplanetary alien creatures. Rather, they deal with all too identifiable human flaws and situations, with religious and social ideology evolving to frightening extremes.</p>
