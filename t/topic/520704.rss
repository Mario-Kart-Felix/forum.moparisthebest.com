Daniel H. Burnham supervised the design and construction; Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscaping. Popularly called the Chicago Fair, the exposition covered 600 acres (243 hectares), attracted exhibitors from 72 countries, and drew over 27 million visitors. 

Cool! You know what the biggest lie is? That the Anchor Bar created chicken wings. They really came from a soulfood restaurant on Buffalo East Side, which is a predominantly black community. They came up with them one year during a blizzard, when delivery trucks couldn get into the city. 

Ben Nelson and Mary Landreau voting with the Republicans again and again. Max Baucus siding with the Republicans again and again. Not ending the filibuster rule when they had the votes to do it. What Makes Them Good: The band recipe for success is its dualguitar flurry of fretboard fireworks; their fingers blast notes out almost poetically, bringing brutality to the table while simultaneously being more neoclassical than Yngwie Malmsteen. Try watching Conan play a guitar solo sometime. In fact, have a look at one right now:. 

Kree Harrison comes to the front and we go through another minireview of her highlights from last night. Jimmy Iovine thinks Kree did not make the right song choices last night. The American Idol judges are not loving his negative commentary about their &#39;Kreedom&#39; all that much. 

The Waterfront Park on the Cooper River is a gem from the recent past that Charleston. The eightacre park features a broad open grassy expanse perfectly designed for picnics as well as smaller, more private areas. The pier allows visitors to walk out by the river and watch mammoth cargo ships head to the nearby port terminals. 

&quot;Who else creates something so readable that stays in our head for so long after we have closed the book? How close are we to the world Margaret Atwood paints? As we chip away at the morality and conscience of our world, and become desensitized to the depravity and violence which results from that, we set ourselves on a course that cannot be stopped. This warning about the eroding of the soul of our culture and our humanity our arts promises a bleak future if we fail to heed it. I love this book because it is smart, scary and so timely.&quot;.
