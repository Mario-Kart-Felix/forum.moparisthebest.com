    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/topic/314030</link>
    <description>Just went to see it. It was the best-effect movie I&#39;ve ever seen. The movie is downright superb, from acting to storyline, it&#39;s unique in every way. In nearly every scene you see people being thrown about like marbles, joining the chaotic death and ultimate end to a long-withstanding mankind. Anyone who likes Independence Day or The War of the Worlds will like this movie, as the same producer did all three movies.

Okay anyway, I&#39;ll quickly go over the story line for those of you who care. The movie runs around a few people who are trying to evade the end of the world, one family in particular. This family, out of dumb luck, are able to know about the end of the world&#39;s presence mere days before it occurs. Their source is some hippie-like character who lives in Yellowstone National Park (&quot;ground zero&quot; for the end of the world). He ended up figuring everything out and broadcast it over the radio, though hardly anyone took heed of it. Anyways, the family is able to escape death numerous times, again out of sheer dumb luck. It&#39;s another movie where, once you look back on it, one step wrong and you die.

This producer amazes me on every end of the world movie he comes out with. In Independence Day, escaping death wasn&#39;t particular difficult. If one would simply live in the middle of &quot;nowhere&quot;, they would never have to deal with the chaos evolving around them. However, I can&#39;t say the same about the War of the Worlds. That was one story/movie where there was no chance of survival. You couldn&#39;t fly, you couldn&#39;t run, and you couldn&#39;t swim. No matter where you went, you died. 2012 is the same in so many ways. The movie bases the entire storyline around a giant cover-up between all the major countries of the world (go figure).

To go into more detail, only a few people in the US government in this movie even knew about this major crisis. They actually knew about it since 2009, in the movie. They, and other countries, immediately began commencing on a major safety project to ensure the survival of the human race. In the movie, China was building 7 arks to house several hundred thousand people. If I recall correctly, only three or four of the arks were actually finished (since the &quot;end of the world&quot; occurred sooner than the scientists in the movie expected ;)). Leave it to China to build huge escape routes for the safety of mankind, and leave it to the US government to lead the conspiracy against mankind.

Like my other topic, I have a question for discussion here. If the end of the world would be known several years, or even centuries in advanced, how would the governments of the world react? Would they solely care on preserving rare artwork/artifacts, species of animals, rich people, politicians, scientists, and a few random people who are considered genetically &quot;worthy&quot;? In most end-of-the-world movies, the government [i]always[/i] covers it up. Couldn&#39;t it work the other way around too? If everyone knew several years in advanced, necessary precautions could be taken for every single family in America. Everyone could come together to work toward their own common survival, instead of relying on a few to save a few.

Here endeth 12-21-12. Now cometh 01-01-01.</description>

<p>Yes, it’s unbelievable how people can say that the story of a caveman building a big enough ship to hold all the fucking animals existing back then is fake. What’s even more astonishing is that people won’t believe the story of a bastard child walking on water, dieing, coming back to live, only to step on a cloud and fly to his real father. WE NEED BIBLICAL EDUCATION! WE NEED TO SPREAD THE WORD!!!</p>
<p>OT: From what I’ve seen of the film, I don’t like it. It’s too dramatized, way too many special effects.[/quote]In my personal opinion, stories from the bible are not meant to be taken literally, but for you to grasp the meaning of it.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s unbelievable how people can say that the story of a caveman building a big enough ship to hold all the fucking animals existing back then is fake. What’s even more astonishing is that people won’t believe the story of a bastard child walking on water, dieing, coming back to live, only to step on a cloud and fly to his real father. WE NEED BIBLICAL EDUCATION! WE NEED TO SPREAD THE WORD!!!</p>
<p>OT: From what I’ve seen of the film, I don’t like it. It’s too dramatized, way too many special effects.</p>

<p>Just playing devil’s advocate here, but have you ever been presented any factual evidence of its existence?  Perhaps a single documented historical event that provides even an inkling of truth within these stories?<br>

Couldn’t it work the other way around too? If everyone knew several years in advanced, necessary precautions could be taken for every single family in America. Everyone could come together to work toward their own common survival, instead of relying on a few to save a few.<br>
[/quote]It’s probably best that only they knew. If everyone knew, going off of the average mentality of society, it would be complete chaos. Yes, there would be logical establishments where they would set up safety precautions, plan ahead of time, etc… But the fact of the matter is, panic is amongst everyone that knows there’s a sliver separating them from the end of life.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think that if society knew several years ahead of time, panic wouldn’t last very long. Instead, everyone would work to saving themselves-- a useless effort. After a few months, the governments of the world would be able to have everyone work together to save as many people as possible, rather than watching everyone die.[/quote]It’s reasonable. But as I’ve said in another thread, perhaps the end of us will be our ignorance in working together.</p>
<p>[quote=“The Reaper X, post:35, topic:313243”]I figure, the world is going to end due to our expectations of it ending. Ironically, we’re all going to panic on 2012 and end up fulfilling fate’s desire in destroying the world. Riots, warfare, anarchy, etc. – assuming the world is going to end soon and we have to act like barbaric idiots on the last days; we’re doomed that day either way.[/quote]To be honest, it’s a little dramatic, but hey-- it would be a great story.</p>

Couldn’t it work the other way around too? If everyone knew several years in advanced, necessary precautions could be taken for every single family in America. Everyone could come together to work toward their own common survival, instead of relying on a few to save a few.<br>
[/quote]It’s probably best that only they knew. If everyone knew, going off of the average mentality of society, it would be complete chaos. Yes, there would be logical establishments where they would set up safety precautions, plan ahead of time, etc… But the fact of the matter is, panic is amongst everyone that knows there’s a sliver separating them from the end of life.</p>

2012 was a great movie… But the world won’t end… If u ever read the bible its not true, but the guy who made the calender died, which is why it stops… Lol =]</p>
<p>But yeah all his movies are good… They amaze you, and are very exciting.<br>
[/quote]There are various reasons of assumption as to why the Mayan calender ended.[/quote]</p>
<p>I think that if society knew several years ahead of time, panic wouldn’t last very long. Instead, everyone would work to saving themselves-- a useless effort. After a few months, the governments of the world would be able to have everyone work together to save as many people as possible, rather than watching everyone die.</p>
