    <description>After a month of beta testing, my newly revamped economy server is out! If any of you remember it from it&#39;s beta testing, we have recoded alot of it, patched many bugs, and added tons of other features. 
We are brand new and looking for staff!

The past 3 days I have been coding these new features and they have finally arrived, I hope you enjoy!

[b]Skills:[/b]

Abysal Runecrafting: You can now access the Abyss from your Teleport Crystal. The Abyss allows you to access all the RuneCrafting altar in convenience. This has been added due to players having a lot of trouble accessing a few altars.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/4uAZH9p.png[/img]

Dungeoneering: We have finally added the long awaited Dungeoneering, with GROUP DUNGEONEERING! Venture through the dungeons defeating monsters to reach the end and gain exp, along with the epic rewards that follow it. To access Dungeoneering, simply go to the Skilling teleports in the Teleport Crystal.

Resource Dungeons: You can now access every Resource Dungeon that RuneScape has to offer. This feature includes the requirements and such and the great features inside. Come venture in them now!

Construction: You can now buy your own house and build in it! This is our last skill that we needed to code and now you can enjoy it. While it is an expensive skill, it is well worth that Completionist Cape. The buildable objects are interactable, meaning you can use the portals, fireplaces, chairs, thrones, altars, etc. Have fun customizing your own houses! To start, talk to the Estate Agent at home.

Max Level: The max level for all skills has been lifted to 120. This is due to the fact that people get bored of training a skill once they reach 99, so why not go for 120! Let&#39;s raise the competition. This feature has been added ingame and to the highscores.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/vH6z8Vb.png[/img]

Prestiging: Yup, it is here. You can now prestige once you achieve your 99s to gain a cool title, status, and access to the prestige store. Everyone should know what this is and how to use it, and if you are clueless, the Dark Mage will give you a tutorial.

[b]Player vs. Monsters[/b]

Sunfreet: The new ultimate boss, bring a group! You can access this boss by clicking the Monster/Boss teleport interface in the Teleport Crystal. This is an extremely hard boss, but it is all the worth as it drops Dominion items such as Dominion Crossbow, Goliath Gloves, and some dragon items. He flies, breathes fire, and more so watch out!
[img]http://i.imgur.com/6DjXIy8.png[/img]

Ring of Wealth: We now have a new working Ring of Wealth. The system is modeled after the original RuneScape one. This will give you drops from the ROW drop table and also increase your chances of getting a rare drop.

[b]Shops and Locations and Minigames[/b]

Player Owned Shops: Modeled after the Grand Exchange, you can create your own shops in which you can sell your items and others can buy it, for your own set price! This works whether a player is online or offline. You also have the ability to search for the item. Pictures will come later...

New Home: We have moved our home to Catherby. Why Catherby? It is large, and has surrounding areas for almost every skill, access to sailing, a bank, etc. You can fish, farm, woodcut, thieve, or anything you want here!

New Shop Location: We have moved our shops to a beautiful location. Nothing much to say but you should look at it in HD :) To access shops, type the command ::shops.

Trivia: We now have a new trivia system for players to answer. The first to answer wins 10 trivia points. There are over 50 questions so they wont be repeated often. To answer, type ::answer (answer). There is a reward shop at home with items you will be please with. Keep an eye out for these questions!

Dark Invasion: A sick game of zombies with exp and item rewards. This very fun minigame of endless zombies tops our original Zombies game. To play, click the Dark Invasion button on the Teleport Crystal.
