    <description>Well I&#39;m not much of an artist so painting or drawing characters is out of the question, all I have is my trusty copy and paste and layer fiddling. Threw it together in about half an hour, just after finishing the movie so not much thought or effort went into it really.

              <p>No I’m not new but I did say not much effort went into making it and I’m not looking to build up on it, I was bored. When I say half an hour I think you forget that most of it was spent looking for the images, cropping/pathing, sitting there gathering quick ideas and then putting it together. It was really just an excuse to listen to my music so I wont be sitting there doing nothing. But I challenge you, the timer starts now and I want you to go out and look for 2 images vaguely similar to the ones I had chosen (not the same), recreate something similar to my image, post it and tell me how long it took. No bullshit either.</p>

              <p>this took you half an hour? What? You barely did anything?</p>
<p>Sorry, don’t interpret that the wrong way. I’m confused, are you new with photoshop? You could’ve made this so much better.</p>

              <p>I like it, it’s just that the character’s contrast is too high and the bg is too light. Try darkening the bg and slightly lowering the character contrast and see how it looks. Good job though.</p>
