For one he didnt donate and when asked about it he gave an email that was no where near the email supposed to be donated to. Also there is a Donate button on website so pretty hard to get it wronge. Also we talked and he said he would give back items till it was all figure out then after he gives back starts spamming we stole his items back after donating. yes bryan was wrong for doing what he did and i will be talking to him about it and he will be punished for what he done and for bringing negative problems to our server<br>
