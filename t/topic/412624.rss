I still disagree with your logic here. Just because you put x hours into the game, and if every programmer out there get’s payed $10 dollars an hour doesn’t mean “x * 10 = gameWorth”. I hope that’s not what you meant. Game quality is measured by the creator and the customer. You need demand for your game.</p>
<p>I know this much, the worst thing you can do in these situations is <span class="bbcode-u">expect</span> that you’ll make this, or you’ll accomplish that.

<p>Sure I can make something quick and dirty but call it a game, but that does NOT MAKE IT A GAME. You people should really do some research on how they make flash games before judging, making a flash game is as hard as making a Java game.

</aside>
<p>I agree with what you said about quality, but there isn’t set prices for these things, so it’s negotiable what the actual pricing would be, and I believe the developer should be one of the last people to judge it. Please don’t assume things about me without verifying it though. I’ve been studying Java for a year and a half now and have coded quite a few applications. By no means are these master quality, I’m a perfectionist though, so when I make something, I put my heart and soul into it, and make it to the best of my ability. So I’m fully aware of it takes to be a developer and the amount of effort and time it goes into making games/applications. I’m done talking about this now, not because I’m stubborn, but because I see this could turn into more of a conflict than anything else.<br>
[/quote]When working in the flash game industry, and seeing other people’s work and seeing a lot of deals happen between developers and publishers and comparing the games for the price they we’re sold for, gave me the amount of money I ESTIMATED for this game. As I said around $700.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, people can calculate the price of a game, there are many different things that need to be considered in a game when calculating it’s price. The graphics, the duration, sounds, music, replay value,…</p>
<p>The flash game industry is unique and there is no other industry that looks like the one from flash games.</p>
<p>Here’s some logic, think about it, most developers I know that make flash games, do this for a living. Why would ANYONE spend many hours making a game and sell it for a low price. There has to be a reason why there IS A flash game industry. The reason is because both developer and publisher profit from it. People pay up to 10 000 dollars for a flash game.</p>
<p>True that the price is negotiable but there is a standard for these types of things. WHY are there soooo many flash games out there? Because people get payed a lot of money for making them. My game for example is very addicting from alpha stage reviews I got, meaning it has a great replay value wich is one of the MOST important feature in a flash game because refreshing ads = $. With the implemented highscores people will try to get a higher score than their opponents. It has great sound effects, custom made music for the game, and it has good reviews. This game has a MINIMUM price of $700 dollars, I won’t sell it for less. When it is 100% completed ofcourse.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well said again, but i look forward to seeing more flash game projects if you plan on releasing more. I think i’m going to get into developing flash games again and maybe i can help you out on your projects…i don’t want any part of your profit i will just be in it for the fun and to be helpful.<br>
[/quote]Thanks for the offer and for backing me up but I prefer to work alone. I appriciate the offer though.<br>
Anyway I’m really busy and you probably won’t be seeing anything soon from me because of my to do list.</p>
<p>I’m first of all going to a programming highschool, that takes a lot of time. Second, I’m working on my C++ for an engine I’m planning to make in the coming 2 years. Third, I have to finish this game. Fourth, I’m writing and designing a MMORPG that will use flash’s Stage3D APIs for hardware accelerated 3D. I’m trying to get famous with the game and make a lot of money because the game will be unique and unlike anything seen before. It’s going to be free and will be using ads for revenue, around the game so that the players won’t be bothered. As soon as I finished designing the game, the mechanics, I’ll start the development. I’m not sure I’ll use Stage3D though because it is only available for developers and has not seen a public release yet. I really don’t care atm because I’m doing the design of the game.[/quote]</p>
<p>Oh yeah…i forgot about your engine development but anyway ok that’s fine i wish you luck with it and i personally think you can do it if you try hard enough over that timespan. Another thing is do you use any email service so i could possibly add you so just incase you get very inactive i will still have a way of contacting you because i follow all your projects because they are very intresting.</p>

With the implemented highscores people will try to get a higher score than their opponents. It has great sound effects, custom made music for the game, and it has good reviews. This game has a MINIMUM price of $700 dollars, I won’t sell it for less. When it is 100% completed ofcourse.</p>

<p>Well said again, but i look forward to seeing more flash game projects if you plan on releasing more. I think i’m going to get into developing flash games again and maybe i can help you out on your projects…i don’t want any part of your profit i will just be in it for the fun and to be helpful.[/quote]Thanks for the offer and for backing me up but I prefer to work alone. I appriciate the offer though.<br>
Anyway I’m really busy and you probably won’t be seeing anything soon from me because of my to do list.</p>
<p>I’m first of all going to a programming highschool, that takes a lot of time. Second, I’m working on my C++ for an engine I’m planning to make in the coming 2 years. Third, I have to finish this game. Fourth, I’m writing and designing a MMORPG that will use flash’s Stage3D APIs for hardware accelerated 3D. I’m trying to get famous with the game and make a lot of money because the game will be unique and unlike anything seen before. It’s going to be free and will be using ads for revenue, around the game so that the players won’t be bothered. As soon as I finished designing the game, the mechanics, I’ll start the development. I’m not sure I’ll use Stage3D though because it is only available for developers and has not seen a public release yet. I really don’t care atm because I’m doing the design of the game.</p>

<p>I still disagree with your logic here. Just because you put x hours into the game, and if every programmer out there get’s payed $10 dollars an hour doesn’t mean “x * 10 = gameWorth”.

<p>I agree with what you said about quality, but there isn’t set prices for these things, so it’s negotiable what the actual pricing would be, and I believe the developer should be one of the last people to judge it. Please don’t assume things about me without verifying it though. I’ve been studying Java for a year and a half now and have coded quite a few applications. By no means are these master quality, I’m a perfectionist though, so when I make something, I put my heart and soul into it, and make it to the best of my ability. So I’m fully aware of it takes to be a developer and the amount of effort and time it goes into making games/applications. I’m done talking about this now, not because I’m stubborn, but because I see this could turn into more of a conflict than anything else.<br>
[/quote]When working in the flash game industry, and seeing other people’s work and seeing a lot of deals happen between developers and publishers and comparing the games for the price they we’re sold for, gave me the amount of money I ESTIMATED for this game. As I said around $700.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing, people can calculate the price of a game, there are many different things that need to be considered in a game when calculating it’s price. The graphics, the duration, sounds, music, replay value,…</p>
<p>The flash game industry is unique and there is no other industry that looks like the one from flash games.</p>
<p>Here’s some logic, think about it, most developers I know that make flash games, do this for a living. Why would ANYONE spend many hours making a game and sell it for a low price. There has to be a reason why there IS A flash game industry. The reason is because both developer and publisher profit from it. People pay up to 10 000 dollars for a flash game.</p>

<p>He just meant if you were a flash developer because it’s different than developing games in java but true that it is equally hard…he just knows more about the flash game industry so he was just trying to make you see things from his point of view but in all fairness we all work hard at what we do so lets be a happy community.</p>
<p>Extra: well the flash game industry is indeed different because the profit mainly depends on webtraffic and advertising etc. and there’s certain price ranges for quality of games and the person who is buying the game is deciding the quality and also how much its worth thats why he was saying he would get roughly that amount.</p>

A developer desides if he wants to make a professional looking game that has good qualities or just some quick ugly game that can get him a quick 300 bucks.</p>

              <p>I have never sold any games because I had never known about the whole flash game industry when I first started making games, I know a lot of people who can back this up and who have sold games before.</p>
<p>The thing is, all the major sites such as newgrounds, kongregate,… sponsor your games aswell, by paying you money for putting their logo in the beginning of your game and adding a more games link in the game. That is the way they got big, they EARN MONEY more than the developers of flash games ever can by generating WEBSITE TRAFFIC, when people visit their website, the price of the website goes up and you should pay attention when playing games, try to count all the ads you see when playing one single game, that is all money for the site owner, imagine apart from you there are about 100k others playing games getting the same amount of ads.</p>
<p>For example on kongregate, 50 000 people is the average online people for the site. Online meaning they are on the site and most of them are playing games. Everyone person who is viewing the site, gets about 3 ads. Lets say that the owners of kongregate earn about 10 dollars per 1000 ads that get viewed on the site (wich is very reasonable for larger sites like kongregate).</p>
<p>With all the above we can count the gross revenue of kongregate, there are 50 000 people on the site, each getting to see 3 ads, meaning that per 50 000 people opening a page on kongregate, kongregate shows them all together 150 000 ads (50 000 x 3). Let’s say that the average time for refreshing or opening a new part of the site for all the people together is about 10 minutes. Wich means that every 10 minutes kongregate shows people 150 000 ads. Wich means that kongregate shows 900 000 ads (1 hour / 10 minutes = 6 || 6 x 150 000) per hour to their visitors. Now let’s do the money counting. We know that per 1000 ads that people get to see they get payed $10. How many 1000 ads is there in 900 000 ads? 900 000 / 1000 = 900 ads. Now, that we know that you just need to do 900 x $10 dollars and you get $9000 dollars per hours of gross revenue for kongregate.</p>
<p>Now you can go and calculate their gross per month. This all would NOT be possible if they did not sponsor games, because those games generate a lot of traffic for the site.</p>
<p>You should know that making flash games is NOT like Game Maker or anything like that, you need CODE EVERYTHING there is no drag and drop interface there is nothing, the youtube player is written in flash, so imagine that flash is a real language like C#. It is also object orientated and everything you should expect from a high level language. Making flash games is not easy wich is why they are expensive, developers work hard and put a lot of time making a decent flash games, some developers make 1 flash game in 2 months for example, but make it really good and sell it for 5000 dollars or more. I’m pretty sure I worked more than 200 hours on that above game because I wrote the engine for it myself, as in I coded everything myself and did not use any APIs or tutorials or anything like that because my logic gave me enough power to make the game what it is without resources. People get 10 dollars per hour for working, wich would mean that for this game I had to get payed 2000 dollars, but the quality of the game is not worth 2000 dollars. The game is only worth 700 dollars in my POV. Ofcourse I might get higher bids and so but you can never tell the exact price of a game.</p>
<p>Anyway here is a site where developers and publishers get together and bid for flash games, <a href="http://flashgamelicense.com" rel="nofollow noopener">flashgamelicense.com</a>.</p>
<p>And at last but not least, everything that uses ads for revenue, and trust me there is a LOT if you payed attetion that uses ads for revenue, has these same calculations above for counting how much revenue they get. Ofcourse we could more indepth calculating the revenue for each type of ad,  video ads, small ads, big ads, clicking on ads,… but that is not for now. If you have any other questions feel free to ask them.</p>

Couple things I want to touch on (Don’t take anything what I say offensively).</p>

<p>How in the world did you come up with that estimate that this game is 700 dollars?</p>

</aside>
<p>What do you mean you don’t like the API’s? Does that mean that half of your code could have easily just been implemented using the API’s? I can understand not liking something…but as far as I’m aware, API’s are built for efficiency and to allow the user to code at a faster pace.<br>
[/quote]Because that’s a standard price in the flash game industry for games like this one, for a crappy flash game, like really crappy, you get 100 dollars. It’s hard to explain, you need to be in the industry to know. It’s like you put your game on the market and people start bidding for the game, there are different types of licenses, for example, an exclusive license wich is the most expensive one, that’s the one where the game is locked on a particular site that the client requested and where the game can only work on that site, then the client asks you to add his logo here and there, and to add his adds here and there, and so forth. You have open licenses where you have to place their logo in your game but are allowed to release your game anywhere you want, ever played a flash game where it said newgrounds or freeonlinegames or crazymoney,… in the beginning? That’s because they pay you to put that there, ever saw a more games button on flash games? That costs money aswell for the client, so I think you get the basic idea now, imagine a game that gets played 300000 times, and the sponsors logo is on the game including links to the game, that generates traffic for them and eventually doubles that 700 bucks they payed, making a game like this takes a lot of time, don’t doubt the simpleness of this, most flash game developers make flash games for a living, making 1-3 a month, generating an average $1800, ofcourse that depends on the quality of the games but you get the point. I for example like to combine an open license with ingame ads, that means I get my 700 bucks in the beginning and IF the game gets really popular like 1 000 000 or 2 000 000 game plays I get an extra 5000 dollars revenue generated by those ads.</p>
<p>And I don’t like APIs because you are using code that you didn’t make, I like to know exactly what is going on in my software and hence I don’t like using APIs because when using them, you don’t know what’s going on. Also it feels like you are not doing the job, someone elses hard work is.</p>
<p>That means that in this particular game, none of the code is written by someone else and all of it is 100% mine. And yes I do use APIs from time to times because sometimes it is just way to much work/impossible to write your own. For example when doing 3D rendering, I’m not going to make my own OpenGL because I don’t like using other peoples code, sometimes you have to use APIs because it has years of work involved wich makes the API what it is today and something you can’t write on your own in for example 5-6 years.</p>
<p>I hope this answers your questions, ofcourse all of the above is my opinion, some people like as less work as possible and like to use as many prebuild game engines even for flash to make really quick games.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hmm, makes sense for the most part. Have you ever been successful bringing in the money? I understand the profit, it’s simple economics. However, coming in my opinion, which could totally be wrong. I don’t see why someone would spend around $700 on a game (good or not), expecting to double or whatever what they put into the game, that’s a huge risk in my opinion. There are so many flash games, it’s hard to believe that it would stand out so much, to bring in that kind of bank.</p>
<p>Honestly, I can’t say anything though, I have little to no experience in the world of mobile applications + flash applications. In other words, I don’t have hands-on-experience to back up what I’m thinking.</p>
