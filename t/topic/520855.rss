OCZ&#39;s official pricing only separates the two drives by $10; the Vertex 2 , and the Agility 2 is slated to sell for $400. Already, though, Newegg has the Agility 2 . Newegg had the F100 listed for $410 a little while ago, which makes sense given the fact that it has the same performance ratings as the Vertex 2. 

We give our children skills to teach them selfconfidence. I first read Jonn stories, and then I gave him books, then words, then sentences, then writing skills; he acquires from stories quirkiness, aesthetics, humour, cohesiveness, logic, fantasy, and the craft of writing. All these I did not teach him, for how could I when books can do a better job?. 

But through her words in these pages, Julia&#39;s voice remains as lively, wise, and encouraging as ever. As she would say, &quot;We had such fun!&quot;August 2005This is a book about some of the things I have loved most in life: my husband, Paul Child; la belle France; and the many pleasures of cooking and eating. It is also something new for me. 

It clearly broken for me on this board. to try and see if the issue was with a specific mouse. All performed virtually the same. You don&#39;t ask about this but when comparing TO to &quot;similar cities,&quot; I hope you mean &quot;Canadian cities,&quot; because comparing crime stats b/t the US and Canada is not straightforward. The biggest problem with that comparison is that composite &quot;crime rates&quot; for Canada comprise a large number of serious and nonserious offences, including quotidian nonsense like &quot;simple assault&quot; (when Ralph Klein was pied by that anarchist in the tiny cowboy hat at the Calgary Stampede, his &quot;attacker&quot; was charged with this offense); in the US, the &quot;crime rate&quot; is ONLY the total among the seven most serious violent and property offenses (murder, rape, aggravated assault, armed robbery, auto theft, grand larceny, burglary). Canadian numbers for composite &quot;crime rates&quot; will always be higher.. 

Director got his &#39;60s vibe back for this one. It&#39;s a nostalgic movie, both for Vegas the way it used to be, and the original Rat Pack (Sinatra&#39;s name is invoked with reverence). Darned if the guys don&#39;t seem a little mistyeyed over the end of the &quot;Ocean&#39;s&quot; trilogy.
