[SIZE=5][B][U][COLOR=#00FF00]What Is Vykor?[/COLOR][/U][/B][/SIZE]
 
[I]Vykor is a Old School project that a few other developers and I have started since around late June, hitting early July. We wanted to build our way up from the bottom, and that&#39;s exactly what we did. We started with a completely blank source, coding each and every skill to perfection, to offer only the best content we can. The goal of this project is to make a perfect economy server that also offers the players a astounding PvP experience, like none other, and to make sure that it is not too difficult, but not too easy, as well as to give you a decent old school server to play, so your time spent at Vykor is enjoyable.

[SIZE=5][U][B][COLOR=#00FF00]Why Is Vykor Unique?[/COLOR][/B][/U][/SIZE]
 
[I]I&#39;m sure you all are wondering what makes Vykor different from all of the other old school servers out there? Why should we play your server over the others that are out there? Well, there are many answers to that. Vykor is different from old school servers in many ways, such as being one of the only servers with a mini-game that is known as Nightmare Zone, as well as having other mini-games such as 07 type Duel Arena, Fight Caves, Barrows, and more. Vykor also has decent XP rates, and skilling rates. with perfect switching, perfect 07 type combat, and more. Vykor is also run by active developers, who care about your opinion, and are ready to make your experience better.[/I]
 
[B][U][SIZE=5][COLOR=#00FF00]When Will Vykor Be Released?[/COLOR][/SIZE][/U][/B]
 
[I]Vykor has been in work for nearly 3 months or more, and we plan on releasing a bit over 1 week. Our estimated release date that we want to hit is September 18th. Vykor will be released with fully working skills, warriors guild, clan wars, and more. Vykor will also be released with a unique system for donating.[/I]
