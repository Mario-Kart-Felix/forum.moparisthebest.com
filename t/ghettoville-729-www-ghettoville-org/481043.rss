    <description>Hi, we are an up and coming server called ghettoville. Our website is www.ghettoville.org. There is a webclient or a downloadable client. We have very nice and extremely helpful staff members. We also have some very cool customs, such as a working iphone, a working mp5, cars and weed. Along with many more customs. You gain experience at a moderate pace, it isnt too slow but its not too fast. Money making is at a good pace as well. We have an admin who updates the pricelist daily to keep the economy stable. There are also many staff give aways and events to gain rewards for recruitment and other fun activities. We also have a donorship program with several different levels of donorship ranging from regular donor through ultimate donor.
