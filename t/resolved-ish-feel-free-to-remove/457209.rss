    <description>I&#39;ll start off by saying this was and has been working since I started using my client, but today has stopped working.  I&#39;ve sat here on google for an hour, and I&#39;m resorting to begging.

My OS is Win7

I did use a Win7 converter to make the run.bat a .exe, which also did not change anything.

Client is Blurr if it&#39;s important.
The run.bat doesn&#39;t even load the client at all, it opens the first cmd screen that closes instantly... and then nothing. 

Keep in mind it was working fine up until today.  Is there any way I can fix this without resorting to changing my run.bat?

Current run.bat:
[code]@echo off
cd Client Files
start javaw -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui
close
[/code]</description>

<p>I downloaded two previous release versions of my client and neither of them will open either…  I downloaded the original client I edited and it opened fine, so I poured the contents of my current client files into it and then it failed to launch…  If my client files are corrupt, why would they stop working now?</p>
<p>[Update]<br>
Apparently my ISP was suspecting me of phishing because my neighbor who was trying to leech my net got pissed and reported me.  Pretty sure he’s getting fined…<br>
The result was is that from what I understand, they were blocking anything that I was porting, which included my server, which if wasn’t ported, my run.bat wouldn’t launch the client.<br>
This has been interesting…</p>

You’re ignorance is of no surprise to me. You probably saw that was a LMGTFY site, and immediately closed out, not even accepting the help I am trying to give you. I’m not going to spoon feed you like you probably are over at whatever retarded community you’re a part of. Also, don’t blame this beautiful community, if you don’t like my help, you can take it and shove it in your ass.</p>

              <p>I’ll start off by saying this was and has been working since I started using my client, but today has stopped working.  I’ve sat here on google for an hour, and I’m resorting to begging.</p>
<p>My OS is Win7</p>
<p>I did use a Win7 converter to make the run.bat a .exe, which also did not change anything.</p>
<p>Client is Blurr if it’s important.<br>
The run.bat doesn’t even load the client at all, it opens the first cmd screen that closes instantly… and then nothing.</p>
<p>Keep in mind it was working fine up until today.  Is there any way I can fix this without resorting to changing my run.bat?</p>
<p>Current run.bat:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
cd Client Files
start javaw -Xmx500m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui
close
</code></p>
