    <title>Enviromental variables</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/enviromental-variables/409889</link>
    <description>ok so i had a problem with my client, i use windows 7 and everytime i went on my client, when i clicked on the map or screen it would cut out, so i looked at whether or not other people have had the same problem and it said my enviromental variables were wrong or i didnt have jdk, 

after that i re-did my enviromental variables, which were wrong... and looked for a java update, i have jdk 6 update 18 and thats what my enviromental variables are also set at so i dont know where i am going wrong, 

also what is jdk 7? will that help me with my windows 7 problem?

please help :(</description>
