    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/377-cache/310391</link>
    <description>The client I&#39;m working on for my server is having a bit of troubles. It has models that are overwriting the correct NPC models. I know the problems with the cache, but I can&#39;t seem to find a clean, reliable one anywhere. I&#39;ve searched for.. going on the third day now. I&#39;m hoping someone can point me in the direction of one, or give me any advice on fixing the problem.</description>
