    <description>Hello I&#39;m using Runefusion, and i was adding fletching stuff into &#39;Items-on-Items.config&#39; 
and i added this, bow string on shortbow(u) = shortbow. i added it in correctly and it wasnt working, (also the already added things in there don&#39;t work.)

So i assume there is something wrong with my config files, so i was hoping if anyone could help me.

Thanks</description>
