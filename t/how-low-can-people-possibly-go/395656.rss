    <title>How low can people possibly go?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-low-can-people-possibly-go/395656</link>
    <description>So , this tuesday my principal said i had to go to the study ( remain at school for 1hr after school is done ) for no reason at all for the rest of the year , above that , my french teacher monster-raged at me for being on a part of the school that&#39;s restricted to people from my class ( even though all my other friends were there , she just raged at me ).
So that day when i come home , i post a mini - rage post on Facebook , then just ignored the whole thing...

Today however , some nerd printed my post and every comment on it and hung it up in my french teacher&#39;s classroom , the secretary and another teacher&#39;s class....

How fuckin&#39; low can people go?</description>

<li>So you call me ignorant for looking at the whole event from a different aspect?</li>

<li>6/10 As a minimum =/= poorly. ( taking in account i have this thing called a ‘Life’.)</li>
<li>I never said it was anybody’s fault ; in the case with the teachers there was an error with communication , as for the person printing off my post , it only says somthing about that person ( in a way that i think is low. )</li>

<li>That’s your personal opinion ; i couldn’t care less about you or about your opinions or thoughts.</li>

<p>Please try again.</p>

Correct grammar? No.</p>
<p><em>word</em> , <em>words</em> is not correct grammar . See it doesn’t seem right , and it is dumb looking and it makes my eyes bleed .[/quote]</p>
<p>As does leaving a space between the . and the last word of each of your sentences.<br>
Also , I can’t stop laughing at these dipshits proving themselves superior just because they critisize other people’s grammar.<br>
AND douchebags like kingman trying to prove somthing to those dipshits by joining them , LOL.</p>
<p>I seriously wonder how these guys wil be like when they eventually grow up.</p>

<ul>
<li>So you call me ignorant for looking at the whole event from a different aspect?</li>
<li>Illiterate , how? In this whole thread i’ve used correct english  whereas most people have written their posts as if they were 6 year olds.</li>
<li>6/10 As a minimum =/= poorly. ( taking in account i have this thing called a ‘Life’.)</li>
<li>I never said it was anybody’s fault ; in the case with the teachers there was an error with communication , as for the person printing off my post , it only says somthing about that person ( in a way that i think is low. )</li>
<li>Laughing at someone doesn’t neccesarily mean that you are ( or even think ) that you’re above someone else.</li>
<li>That’s your personal opinion ; i couldn’t care less about you or about your opinions or thoughts.<br>
[/quote]</li>
</ul>
<p>Ignorant because you blame others more than yourself. A lot.<br>
As JC pointed out: no ; you, havent.<br>
I have a life, my minimum is 8/10 (fucking science man, what are you going to do) and I consider that poor.<br>
You said you wanted to punch the person who printed it off in the face, and that your punishment was a result of them doing what they did.<br>
As long as you acknowledge that Jc is way above you, sure, laugh all you want. Just know that you are laughing at yourself.</p>

<p>You act extremely self-defeating and counterproductive. It’s not an opinion.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>I’m not even gonna try to defend that argument as you just don’t seem to understand anything i’ve posted regarding it.</li>
<li>Just because i like to use reading marks such as <span class="bbcode-b">,</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">;</span> doesn’t mean my English isn’t correct.</li>
<li>Try to see 6/10 as a nullpointer : anything under it is bad , anything above it is good.</li>
<li>Yes , it kind of is.</li>
<li>I’m laughing at the fact that I can remain calm whilst he is raging at me , how does that have anything to do with him/me being lower/higher then him/me.</li>
<li>In my eyes you are being counterproductive towards me whilst I seem counterproductive to you ; it’s an opinion.</li>

<p>First , saying “Fuck you” is somthing we all say at least once a day , at least here on my school…<br>

If he has a good reason for it then i’d be more respectfull towards him , but i’ve never really done anything wrong with the intention of hurting someone , so nobody has the right to do such a thing to me…[/quote]<br>

I’m pretty much laughing at (Anthony) , Jc22493 and Davidi2’s posts , as none of you three seem to get what my point is.[/quote]<br>
nor do you see our points which are obviously more valid than yours</p>

<p>6/10 is just good enough (i’m not proud of it ; but i consider it as a minimum and i’ve always been above it.) ; i don’t know what your parents problem is Anthony , but hitting 10/10 for every test is merely impossible on my school.</p>

</aside>
<p>6/10 is nowhere near good enough and if scoring 10/10 on every test is impossible, the whole school is probably filled with inane minds like yours… (that would explain your ineptitude)</p>

<p>Secondly , if 9 teachers tell you its ok and 1 teacher tells you to not do it ; what the hell would you do?<br>

<p>use some common sense let me go with the old saying, if 9 teachers tell you to engage in sexual activities with your mother and only one tells you otherwise, what would you do? i hope you wouldn’t make the same blunder you did here</p>

<p>if you don’t take into account consequences as a result of idiotic actions, then you’re just mad ignorant bro</p>
<p>anyways, this whole thing is your fault. why? if you never took the first step of posting shit on fb, there would have been nothing to print out. deal with the mockery, suck it up, and don’t do it again. stop raging and trying to make yourself feel better on moparscape it won’t work[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s funny how i’m laughing throughout the whole thing whilst you’re the one raging to defend yourself without any valid points.<br>
Let me guess how you think about war  ; " If there weren’t any people on this planet there wouldn’t be any war" , that’s what you’d think right?</p>
<p>Also , you just took my statement , turned it 180 degrees and say it’s the same ; i can’t say anything else but this:<br>
