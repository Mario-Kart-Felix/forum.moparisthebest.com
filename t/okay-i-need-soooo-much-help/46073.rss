    <title>Okay... I Need SOOOO Much help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/okay-i-need-soooo-much-help/46073</link>
    <description>Okay. I know I posted a bunch of things like &quot;Testscape won&#39;t save what I change for my char?&quot; and a few others. I need a lot of help. Here is 1 thing I need to let you know.....

1. I READ MOD TAHAROK&#39;S ULTIMATE SERVER GUIDE!!!

I did not understand 1 bit of it.

Here are my questions

1. Is there anything else I need to download? (I&#39;ll list what I got later)
2. How come what I change what I put in my client.java and save it nothing happens to my Testscape?
3.I downloaded a source, now how do I get it to be mine?

Okay. Those are my questions. And what I have is a Testscape source. When I log onto it, it says who the mods and admins are... I also have the I.P. [5.110.89.232] (which i got from my hamachi =]) and other people can log into into it. But I can&#39;t give any people admin/modship.

Here are some things I know how to do...
1. I know how to open up client.java and all the other stuff.
2.I know how to open/extract files and find my stuff

Here are things I don&#39;t know how to do...
1. Enter my own codes

What I did:
I went to client.java and found the messages that pop up at the bottom of the screen. I changed &quot;Welcome to Testscape!&quot; to &quot;Welcome to Linscape!&quot; and nothing changed (Even after i saved). I also changed the admins to my name from &quot;admin&quot; to &quot;Lin&quot; and still... nothing happened... (And these were the messages that appeared at the bottom when you logged in) I also changed my player rights (Under the character folder) from 0-3... Like character-rights = 0 to... character-rights = 3...
NOTHING CHANGED!!! SO WILL SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME!!!

Thank you Sooo much... And if you tell me how to change the rights I&#39;ll make you ADMIN!!! (Don&#39;t tell me to find where it says rights and change from 0-3... I already know that... Well, you can but I don&#39;t know how to keep it saved)(Clicking on File and clicking on save/saveas won&#39;t work)

With great thanks, Lin. (Whew, done typing)</description>

              <p>Aight, honestly, I didn’t bother to read past the 6th line. But I can post that there are some “unedited” testscapes out there that are obfuscated, and you can’t change them. You might just want to go with a different source.</p>
