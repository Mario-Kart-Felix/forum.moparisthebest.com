And then My spouse and i saw one dive like it just missing all power.&quot;Midwestern Localised Medical Center Chairman Rich J Stephenson told Cbs television studios News Early Display Anchor Bryant Gumbel the crash looked necessary. &quot;They looked like they attemptedto avoid each other, concurrently they both pulled up,Inch Stephenson said. &quot;It was just terrible.&quot;Preliminary reports indicated the two planes were nearing the Waukegan Airport, close to the site of the impact.Zion is about 45 kilometers north of the downtown area Chicago, near the Illinois-Wisconsin range.Collins, who was three weeks less than his 58th birthday, was an avid flyer plus a motorcycle enthusiast.
