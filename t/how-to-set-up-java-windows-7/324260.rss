    <title>How to set up Java (windows 7)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-set-up-java-windows-7/324260</link>
    <description>well i got a laptop for x-mas and i have been trying to fix the java set up to work for my laptop, now, JDK was a useful for XP and vista, with window 7 java files are differently setup.

now there are JDK codes for windows 7 that take longer to add and require all of setting to be changed.

Right now Jre6 with JDK (atm update 17) is the best java for windows 7 (for server running)

go to: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

Download JDK with Jre! (all other java without Jre are 50% likely to glitch up on windows 7, trust me i went though it)

Once installed time to edit the Enviroment Variables:

go to start and right click computer, then hit properties

Enviroment Variables..

Now click new and put these codes and names in:

Variable Name: CLASSPATH

Variable code: [code]CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin;%CLASSPATH%;[/code]

Variable name: PATH

Variable code: [code]C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin;[/code]

This code is 100% made my by, i used no tuts to make it cause its easy to make these, its just hard to find the working java that works with new operating systems.
