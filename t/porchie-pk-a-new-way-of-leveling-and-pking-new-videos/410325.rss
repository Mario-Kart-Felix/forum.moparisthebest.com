Hello everyone, welcome to the Porchie PK development thread, on here you will be able to find the latest updates and progress I&#39;ve made on the server. This isn&#39;t a server that is going to be like all the other 2005/2006 remakes that everyone is trying to make. Instead, I&#39;ve decided to implement many ways for players to interact and have fun with each other in a fun way. The server is about 40 percent of the way done, and I&#39;m working my hardest to try and complete the server ASAP.


  Porchie PK is a unique runescape experience for players, which allows for players to interact, level, and PK with each other in a fun environment. The server&#39;s leveling system is based off of runescape dungeoneering system, however I&#39;ve implemented a few changes into it.

I&#39;ve also began working on the &quot;Varrock Lockout&quot; Minigame, which will be similar to that of fight pits. Players will enter Varrock&#39;s waiting room for the game from either of the four entrances to varrock, all of which are accessible VIA the dungeon. This makes so players must be atleast level 60+ or so to take part in the game. There is also a teleport going to the waiting room, however you need the corresponding key to be able to use it. When the minigame starts, players will be teleported to the middle of Varrock, from there they will be able to reposition themselves accordingly to what is going on. Player&#39;s will then have to fight 8 waves of monster&#39;s together, varying in difficulty. At the end of the fifth wave, player&#39;s inventories are replenished with cooked sharks, as nobody will be able to keep a fully stocked inventory the whole minigame. The 8 waves of monsters are of varying difficulty, and players must work together to defeat the monsters. Players will all be rewarded points for each monster killed, and will recieve a bonus for every round they complete. They can then spend these points at the corresponding shop, which can be found in the four waiting rooms, at home, or at the Master&#39;s City.

- Bank before every boss
- Games run for 30 minutes
- Maximum of 40 Players
- When teleported in, players will spawn in a waiting room
- When waiting time = 0 the players will be teleported to the game room
- The bosses located in this room are in a sequence, where players must run forwards to find the bosses and battle them one at a time
- Multicombat is obviously enabled
- Bosses have 6500 + HP, however do not hit exceptionally high damage
- After a boss is killed, this creates a new checkpoint in which the players will respawn at if they die (New checkpoint is in between bosses to allow for a faster return trip to bosses)
- When bosses are killed, all players that are inside the area and have done damage to the boss will recieve X amount of Boss Points
- Boss Points are based on the difficulty of the boss killed

More minigames will be added shortly, as I am currently working on implementing a ZOMBIES minigame, where players are teleported into a cave, two of whom will be ZOMBIES, with dragon claws, and full zombie armor. Other players will be normal players, however will be equipped with a AGS to defend themselves against the evil undead. When players are killed by zombies, they will become infected and equipped with a pair of d claws, and full zombie armor. They will then spawn in the zombies lair, and begin their hunt to infect their old team-mates. The minigame should be implemented within the next week.

Varrock Lockdown!
Almost finished, need to add npc&#39;s and death method.

 - Located at varrock, accessible via the lumbridge dungeon

 - Awards tokens per each npc kill (Misc (1-100) based on npc level)
 - Awards total kills x 5 tokens at the end of the game (250 total kills x 5 = 1250 bonus tokens!)
 - 20 Waves of fighting!
 - 1 Boss wave (Chance to drop rares)
 - The minigame requires players to run all around varrock, as spawns will spawn in new locations every 5 waves.

              <p>I have a pretty interesting idea for you. Instead of teamPK teleports etc, you need to get the key access to the area and so on which you have already done, there could be teleports to these areas in certain dungeons. Such as an harder dungeon could have a well teleport or something to take you to godwars, or an easier dungeon could teleport you to teamPK so that you don’t get to play the minigames until you are some-what of an higher level.</p>

<p>Level 108 npcs? Kewl, but there is the real god wars bosses right?</p>
<p>You should also add corp as like the 5th last boss for your dung, 4th last would be zammy, 3rd sara, 2nd bandos, and the most pain in the ass one, armadyl.</p>
<p>If you have kq as a boss already then your project is coming along, if the kq changes form after dying then I can’t wait!</p>

              <p>I’ve already fixed the bug with being able to no-clip on startup, similar to how you do it. When you log into my server, a screen will pop up saying how many tokens you have in your bank, total tokens you have earned, total npc kills, and some other little bits of info about the server, as well as the updates.</p>
<p>I’ve yet to actually clip every object I’ve put in, partly because I can’t find a overall NPC clipping tutorial for delta, I know it has to do with worldmap 2 co-ords, however I can’t figure out how to get them to work? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> All a new experience for me, however I’m going to do my best to completely fix clipping. The following no-clip is going to be hardest to fix I believe, however I have a few good idea’s of what to do to get around allowing players to follow through the doors.</p>
<p>I’ve also posted a topic in the development team section now! So if you’re interested in lending me a hand on the server, please post over there ^^ I’m uploading some new videos to youtube now, most of which are just overviews of the dungeon area (Me running through them)</p>
<p>As for your post mendorphins, regarding the Varrock Lockdown minigame. I didn’t get to do even half of it on the youtube video, and I’ve made some changes to it already ^^ Some info on the minigame that might clear up the concerns you had:</p>
<ul>
<li>After round 5, NPC waves begin spawning in different area’s around varrock, therefore players will have to actually move</li>
<li>Working on a <strong>SHUTDOWN</strong> Lever, which will clear the current wave (Only able to use it once per game)</li>
<li>There’s 20 waves (Including a boss wave)</li>
</ul>
<p>Will try to update the topic in a bit, thanks for all the feedback guys!</p>

Maybe load the clipping before the clicking, so to speak. Everything is initiated in order. Top to bottom.</p>
