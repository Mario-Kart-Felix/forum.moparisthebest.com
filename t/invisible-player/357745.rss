As you can see.. Player one can see Player two, Player two can&#39;t see player one, but can see &#39;null&#39;. and null in the chatting..

This is a stripped down server from my X-PK server, being run with my X-PK client.
I also think it doesn&#39;t handle login responses so it may be client.java related,
It doesn&#39;t output a login response when I try to connect a mudclient40 client to it, but my original XPK server does put out a response when you try to connect.. so im not sure what&#39;s up there.. any ideas guys ?

EDIT:
Fixed the login responses, still can&#39;t see the player tho, players that are already logged in can see players that login, but the ones that login can&#39;t see the ones that are already logged in.</description>
