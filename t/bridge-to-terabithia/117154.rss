    <title>Bridge To Terabithia</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bridge-to-terabithia/117154</link>
    <description>Ok peopes of Moparisthebest, I bring you the movie, Bridge to Terabithia. If you haven&#39;t seen this movie, don&#39;t. This particular movie sends me into a world of sadness. Disney once again, kills a kid - but oh noes, its always the little girl whos always the cool person in the movie. Within the movie you are introduced to a few &#39;main&#39; characters, Jess Aarons, and Lelslie Bruke, Lelsie being the new girl and Jess being a farm boy

[img]http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A9gnMiWdAoJGEwoALEqjzbkF/SIG=14t03m8ge/EXP=1183011869/**http%3A//us.movies1.yimg.com/movies.yahoo.com/images/hv/photo/movie_pix/walt_disney/bridge_to_terabithia/_group_photos/annasophia_robb1.jpg[/img]

But what brings me to sadness is, that these to become very great friends, exploring a world they both made together having the best times of their lives. Then tradegy strikes, On a day back to terabithia, young Leslie falls into a creek and dies(WTF??? ITS A KIDS MOVIE BITCH) Jess is driven to sadness, I turned the movie off, I didn&#39;t finish it. You become attached to this young girl(14 - 15 years old) then one day, BOOM she dies, I almost cried. Why does Disney always do this, the kid either has no mom or the best person in the movie, intentially the person you become atached to dies, the innocent little girl who opens this young boys eyes to a fanticial world with unlimited pocabilitys dies and I had to hugged my friend :(

What I&#39;m trying to point out here is, What in the hell is wrong with Disney? They always kill somebody, they kill more people than horror movies, their the only people who kill kids ... Are these people so sick they have to make a movie killing off little kids? What in the hell is wrong with these people. Their suppose to be #1 kid animation, and yet they kill more kids than rapist.</description>

<p>yeah i thought it was sad when she died but i kinda figured that would happen seeing at was a Disney movie and they bring up to much shit like the whole child abuse thing they had with the freaky looking girl was that even needed? i mean c’mon and the movie was short as fuck i have to say i mean most movies are about 2hour-2 1/2hours right? that movie was 96 fucking minutes!!! is it even long enough to be a movie?</p>

<p>What they did is destroyed the book, they broke it down horridly. They took out so much, it takes me about 2 days to fully read that book if I ignore details and don’t get into it. Thats something thats worthy of at least 2hours of film, or possibly 2 different films.</p>
<p>[quote=“XxKanexX, post:33, topic:117154”]Most Disney movies are short.<br>
Except for Pirates 3- Shit, that went forever.[/quote]<br>
Older Disney films, when Walt Disney was still around, the movies where much longer. If you check the newer movies and the older ones, you’ll see the difference.</p>

              <p>MybJames, you don’t seem to read very well so I’ll try to explain. I said that in Disney movies, kids usually don’t have a mom, a sister - they ususally die in some freak accident that makes no since. This is just pushing it further down the line. Since you couldn’t read it before let me quote it for you</p>

Are you retarded? Is he sexist because the girl dies instead of the boy? I think i speak for all of us when i say, if you don’t like it, piss off.</p>

They put the baby stuff on in the morning(when most people are at school)<br>
and has all this bs teenage stuff in the afternoon/evening.<br>

Well I’ll explain deeper.<br>
Disney always shows kids movies/shows in the morning.<br>
They do this because us older kids are at school.<br>
Around 1-2 pm they adjust.<br>
I’ve watched a few shows in the past, and they have crap like you said, kids dieing, dogs/cats dieing.<br>
Older kids can know its a movie, younger kids can’t.<br>
I know when I was a 4 yr old, I though Rugrats was real.<br>
They’re even putting sexual(fairly mild though) refrances into their movies.</p>

<p>The saddest thing about her death was she died 'cause he ditched her to go to a museum, so she drowned.<br>
But, yeh, loved it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
It was sad, yes. But did you have something to connect that to? Take for instance, have you ever had a close friend die/killed? Thats what tears me up the most, is the situation it puts me in. It makes me think back to everything thats happened in my life and what I could have done to stop these people’s lives from ending.[/quote]<br>
Yes, but, Just because it brought back some memories doesn’t mean you should tell people not to go watch it. Others might enjoy it.</p>
<p>And no, i didn’t have something to connect to. I’ve never had a close friend/releative die, but it was still pretty sad. Unexpected, too.</p>
<p>I’m gonna’ go see it again, aha.</p>

<p>I loved it too. I was sad when she died.</p>
<p>Also, Disney doesn’t always make children movies. Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie that was produced by Disney, but is meant for all ages. I didn’t think that it was a children’s movie.</p>
