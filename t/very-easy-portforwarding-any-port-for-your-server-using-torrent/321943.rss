    <title>[Very easy] Portforwarding any port for your server using µTorrent</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-easy-portforwarding-any-port-for-your-server-using-torrent/321943</link>
    <description>Hello and welcome to the first of my tutorials. What i am going to show you is very easy to do, but can save a hell of a lot of time fiddling around with portforwarding.

Why? Some people recently in the MoparScape help section have been posting portforwarding problems.
Diffuculty:
[b]0.001 / 10 for experienced
possibly 1/10 for less experienced.
[/b]
Objective: Portforwarding without going through your router.

Step 1: Downloading µTorrent

[size=14pt][b]http://www.utorrent.com/download.php[/b][/size]

I think downloading is the easiest bit. Simply download and install. 

Now run the programme.

2. Popped up?

So you have run the programme for the first time and this pops up

[size=16pt]Ignore the red ring!!!! Press cancel.[/size]

Now we need to portforward.

3. Portforwarding

Your utorrent client should look like this:

If it does then great :)
[size=11pt]If it has minimised, it is probably in the system tray thing. Look to the bottom right of your screen and look for the tiny green and white µ icon[/size]

Now we have it up go into options -&gt; preferences:

It should look something like this:
[img]http://smartestgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/configure-utorrent.png[/img]

Now we need to change these options.
[size=13pt]I will change the port to match port 43594 but change it to your own port[/size]

[size=15pt]MAKE SURE THE TICKS ARE JUST LIKE THE ONES IN THIS PICTURE!!![/size]

Press ok and then minimise it!

Now its time to check if it has worked!!!

Go to this website: [size=14pt]Again set up for port 43594[/size]

[size=11pt][url=http://www.utorrent.com/testport?port=43594]http://www.utorrent.com/testport?port=43594[/url][/size]

If it looks like this: 

[img]http://common.ziffdavisinternet.com/util_get_image/21/0,1425,sz=1&amp;i=213832,00.jpg[/img]

You have sucessfully portforwarded correctly.

If not please go over this tutorial again.
