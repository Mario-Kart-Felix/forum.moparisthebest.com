    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/red-vs-blue-the-blood-gulch-chronicles/15291</link>
    <description>  Well to strart off red vs blue is a machinma series based on Halo &amp; Halo 2. their latest addition to the series is the five part mini-series Out of mind. All five parts hve been released for the public to see (ill put the link at the bottom). Anyway there is two teams, which you would&#39;ve guessed, which are red and blue. They are &#39;fighting&#39; a civil war over the canyon.

  On the blue team there is: Caboose, the dumb rookie. Church, the fowl mouthed self - appointed leader. Tucker, the ladies man. Tex, the freelancer and shelia the tank. and on the red team theres: sarge,the sargent. Grif, seventh in command of a squad of four. Simmons, the kissass and Donut,the supposedbly gay one.

So, the series is probbaly one of the funniest things on the internet, the mini series out of mind dosent have all of the characters it just follows tex and her story.

Score :9\10
