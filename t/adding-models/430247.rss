    <title>Adding models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-models/430247</link>
    <description>I am trying to find/make a client that will work with a czar source. The one I have shows some of the items, but a lot of them are nulled.

Can someone either:
- help me find a client with all silab items?
- help me figure out how to add the item models into the client?

I have been searching around google and moparscape to find help, but I can&#39;t find anything.</description>
