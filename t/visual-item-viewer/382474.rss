    <description>hi guys, i was wondering if there was a peace of software or a program that can view items on a 317 server. its a pain adding stuff to shops without seeing what it is. you do have item lists yes but it would just be so much eaiser if all you had to do was open a program, drop in the Id and click search. hopefully there is one  :| if not oh well back to looking at didgets and letters...

many thanks

<p>Instead of putting “*RSPS: The Tormented (% complete: 60%)” On every single post, just make a signature <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Also, I don’t think that there is program like that, it takes two seconds to make a shop and test it. Don’t be lazy.</p>
