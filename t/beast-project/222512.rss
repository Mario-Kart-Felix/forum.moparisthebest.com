    <description>Okay i am deciding to release my project to the public&#39;s help... I was working on this myself but too many testers were not didicated to doing this. 

I will need DEDICATED people that can work there times around mostly me. I am in New York rite now and have a 3 hour ahead times than usual, i live in Nevada.

Now here is the people i want helping me in this project:

First of all having more than 15 rep, this can be other than moparscape just give me proof from some other site.

Second experiance with Project C-Zar sources.

Third having msn or a head set or stay in contact other than the forums.

Fourth having hamachi to connect to the server (for reasons that other people cant come bother us)


Ok now is what i am telling you what this project is about.

I am trying to make a fun server that is dedicated with coders that we can make atleast 1 big update a week. I want this to be better than the normal server you see on the server status. This server will more than likely never be posted for a download because it will mean more than just throwing all that work away to then being leached. I will take all the help i can get but you must have all of those requirements. 

Now i am showing you how to register:

Ok here is the simple way:

Add me set601@hotmail.com and we will talk about it on there.

The other way:

[code]Name:
Age:
Experiance with coding: (Some or Alot)
Do i have all the regirements:
Will you be dedicated?[/code]



I need


Testers:
Blade Cog

Coders:
Pkinnub(me)




Other info: My real name is Billy so call me that, i am 13, and i have been coding for 2 years now, (still can get kinda nubby with the questions) and as i said my msn is:    set601@hotmail.com


Ok post away to become my testers/coders, i will tell you the secret network when you talk to me on msn.</description>

<p>i guess that show how much hamachi doesn’t work with the people.</p>
<p>pkinnubpk, I’m not going to register fully because im currently working on something for myself, but if u want, i can give out a small amount of coding or “anything you need” help i guess. pm on forums if you can’t get a hold of any other employers or whatever you wanna call these people your getting for this thing. I’ll just stick to communication through mopar since I’m working on my source. But this sounds pretty big. Just gonna tell you now, your gonna need a lot of time. Good Luck</p>
