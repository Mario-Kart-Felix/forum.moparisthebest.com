    <title>Question on &#39;if&#39; statements and so on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-on-if-statements-and-so-on/284156</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I have a couple of questions... here they are:

1.       No one can seem to help me on the issue of making an item cost a certain amount of &#39;tokkul&#39; instead of normal coins... There must be a simple way to do this, but, someone suggested making and &#39;if&#39; statement in my client class to tell my server that, for instance, if the item ID is 1497 it would cost 1000 tokkul. Would this be possible and how would I write in a code that said item would cost tokkul?

2.       Also, I may not be explaining myself very well, but no one can seem to help me with this either: I have asked for the coordinates for godwars (the room before you enter that cave-like thing and it says &quot;all your godwars kills drain from you&quot;. You have to kill 20 saradomin priests to enter that cave-like thing ^^. Someone gave me these coordinates: 2867 9955, they are not the right ones, I believe. (Those coordinates put me in front of an ice throne and ahead of me is a strange maze where you have to climb up ladders onto wolf mountain and back down into the maze. If anyone knows the coordinates for the room where you can choose which god&#39;s room to enter (there are four holes in the ground, and you can choose which god room to enter... there is also a dead guy near these four holes, between a bunch of rocks). But I would really appreciate these coordinates, and if you don&#39;t understand what I am talking about, I will try to explain it better and get a screen shot if you like...

Thanks a lot

              <p>Okay, thanks a lot, mate… This will help me a lot.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 19, 2009, 12:11:40 am[/size][hr]But do you know how I would make it cost tokkul, not have a command for every item that needs to be tokkul. I would assume it would be in client class but I have an item in my server that costs 33k tokkul and I searched it’s ID and found nothing. I just need to know how to make an item cost tokkul instead of coins…</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<li>To make it easier on yourself, just make a command to buy the item.  Example:</li>

<p><code>if(command.equalsIgnoreCase("buy1497")) {
 if(playerHasItemAmount(tokkulID, amountOfTokkul)) {
  addItem(1497, 1);
