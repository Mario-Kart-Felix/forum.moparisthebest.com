    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-rsc-skill-idea/294540</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like something to work on, but I don&#39;t know what.

If you have an idea for a skill you&#39;d like to see in RSC please post it.

It doesn&#39;t have to be original.</description>

              <p>“Animal skill”</p>
<p>Customize some land and fill it up with many different types of animals, (new NPC’s) some weaker and some stronger. To raise the animal skill players have to start off by killing the weaker animals and then move up to the stronger. (Faster XP) This would require lots of space and fast respawn rates on the animals as I am sure that the place would be packed full of players.</p>
<p>Make a maximum level for the animal skill e.g; 99 - Once a player<br>
obtains 99 “animal skill” then that player is able to buy &amp; use all types of animals, of course this would mean that some animals have to be stronger than others otherwise its pointless. E.G If a “lion” is the strongest animal then you would require the maximum “Animall skill” level to be able to buy and use it. Each animal has its own stats menu, stronger / weaker than other animals. I would also make it very hard to obtain the strongest animal.</p>
<p>What would the animal be used for?</p>
<p>You could use the animal for many things depending on what approach you want to take with the animals main point. Mine would be that you would be able to use it in a stake OR I would create a new NPC that drops some “special” new item and can only be defeated with the use of a certain type of animal.</p>
<p>Maybe it can help you in a stake?</p>
<p>If I was to make the animals able to help players in a stake then I would make it that once a player presses a set “Hotkey” in a stake the ingame character completely dissappears off screen and you become your animal, of course the animal would need to give you some type of advantage otherwise its pointless but it also needs to remain fair otherwise it can ruin staking completely. The main point of the animal in a stake would be that it has a higher chance of hitting a high number (30) on your opponent compared to an ingame character and the player fighting the animal can’t hit/harm the animal so the player that used the animal remains full HP whilst he is using his animal, of course the animal can’t hit on a player every time.</p>
<p>To keep it fair I would make it so that the animal is only alowed to be used for 1 attack/round, (Explained in next paragraph) anything more could just ruin staking. The animal would only be use-able in the first 10 seconds (Maybe on an onscreen timer so players are aware of the seconds they have left to use their animal) of the “fight/stake” otherwise players could use the animal at a crucial time and I am sure players would complain that its unfair, E.G; Sometimes when a stake takes place, a player hits big numbers straight away and the other player is left with 30-40HP whilst the other player is still on full HP, using the animal at this point would be unfair as it <span class="bbcode-b">might</span> finish the stake quickly and wouldn’t give the other player a chance to come back, you also have to consider that people stake players that are lower HP then them and have to start with armour off.</p>
<p>The reason I said that the animal should only be use-able for 1 round/hit is because you have to keep in mind that their are all different type of stakers, E.G; “Mage Staking” - Magers have very low HP and if someone was to use their animal on a mage for more than 1 round then its a very likely 2hit, depending on how strong the developer makes the animal.</p>
<p>To prevent something like this I would add a “Animal - on/off” option on the staking menu so that both players have to agree to use animals before persuing with the stake.</p>
<p>Another idea of what you could use the animals for would be that you could use them during PKing, I personally wouldn’t recommend this as it would give an advantage to the player <span class="bbcode-b">with</span> the animal as there would be no way of making an instant agreement between players to use animals, unless you create a deatmatch (DM) option. Also, many players wouldn’t enjoy this, they like PKing how it is.</p>
<p>There are many ways of which you could make this skill more interesting;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You could keep the animal as an item in your inventory, maybe inside some sort of “magical ball” and the player is able to “right click - <span class="bbcode-b">release animal</span>” whenever he wants. Once a player releases it, the animal follows that player which released it, sort of like “showing off” with it, would look pretty good in a crowd full of players and alongside them their own animal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the animal is kept as an item then players would be able to stake their animals or fight in the wild with them as an object and lose the animal. This would mean that players can trade/sell the animals to players who have the required level to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You would need to work out some sort of way of players obtaining the animals in the first place, maybe once you obtain obtain a level that allows you to use a new type of animal then you are able to buy that animal once (only) from a shop / “animal seller NPC”. The main point of this would be that the animals would be harder to obtain and it would make them more valuable for players to trade.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<p>10 animal levels allows you to use a “pony”. (lol) Once a player gains the 10 levels then you can buy the “Pony” once from the shop / animal seller NPC.</p>
<p>Later on you could introduce:</p>
<p>Animal armour:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paws - Metal paws / Golden paws</li>
<li>Animal Helmet / Crowns - Not a full helmet that covers the whole head, just something notice able. I wouldn’t recommend making the “crowns” look similar to party hats though, they look to bright for “animals” to wear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t get too silly with the armour ideas because you will just end up ruining the animal. (I doubt anyone will even attempt to make new animal NPC’s nevermind trying to make armour for them)</p>
<p>This idea would work really well for a server like RSCA as its a duplicate of RSC and doesn’t just focus on one thing, meaning that they could introduce many more purposes for the animals, wereas a PKing server may just want to use the idea of using the animals in wild.</p>
<p>Ideas aren’t the problem, the real issue is that no-one is willing to put the time and effort to actually do something new thats long and complicated, especially for a private server.</p>

One really good skilling server thats   execlty as rsc or one really good pk server , these days pk server is what poeple want, and rscA is the closest to real rsc there is but nothing is realised. but if you are bored sumtime you can work with it cuz it will take  alot of time. you can sell it give it away or host it yourself. but i think thats one of the best suggestion you will get.</p>

              <p>maybe make construction but also add in landscaper  and welder (spinoff of smithing)</p>
<p>construction- anything to do with indoors stuff and maybe outdoors things such as wooden benches, wooden shed, wooden fence</p>
<p>landscaper- adds trees, flowers, makes new paths, perm firepits, maybe adding ore rox , ponds with fishing spots, bushes and maybe add like a snape grass tree or a limpwurt plant to get those from also so it has potential of making money</p>
<p>welder- can make outdoor things such as steel tool sheds, swingsets, torches ,gazebos, workout bench (to train strength on), stronger houses, anvils that add smithing xp depending on what anvil u have ( bronze, iron, steel, mith addy or rune) all items have better upgrades such as tool shed it can store 5 items at bronze 10 at iron 15 at steel 20 at mith 27 at addy and 35 at rune like a mini bank . also swingsets raise agility depending on what one u got torches for fm and looks gazebos i dunno lol.</p>
<p>well thats my idea guys enjoy</p>

              <p>There’s already been forms of RuneCrafting, and Slayer. Personally, I would like to see something thats like JaGeX’s “Summoning” on RS2. It wouldn’t have to be like it exactly, just something where you level it someway, by getting supplies from killing monsters, and then you can summon an NPC to help you, or just follow you around for looks.</p>
<p>It most likely won’t happen, but if it does, show me some pics plawks. (Just something I like…lol)</p>
