    <title>Need help setting up a shop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-setting-up-a-shop/377355</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve prepared a pk points system for my server.

and a shop that can sell items for those &quot;pk points&quot; i need to make.

How do i get an npc with the trade option to open up a shop window and have the shop opened.

Or at least an npc that has a talk to option where when you talk to him that also opens the shop.

I&#39;d rather have the talk to option though. and for the shop to utilize the pk points instead of coins?

Anyone have any ideas?</description>
