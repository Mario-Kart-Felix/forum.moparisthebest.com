    <description>Hello everyone, 
  so i am nearing the release of my 508 server. but i have realised that not many people are going to want to play my server if it isnt 24/7. So i really need help with that. Also if somone could easily how to get a webclient on my own website that would be great.

Also i cant get my no-ip to work. I have an ip-changer client. I have a no-ip, the only way people can get onto my server is hamachi which really sucks..

Also if you have teamview that would be soooo much easier :)
my username is   357 152 302
and password is   5260

Thanks alot,

              <p>Sounds like you need to port forward… Depending on your router/isp, it can be pretty easy.</p>
