    <description>I haven&#39;t had a private server.. in like.. 2 years...
Im about to try to make a new one again, but I don&#39;t remember too much about this.

Edited 90% of my source, Port forwarded and all that...

Problem is, I cant run the server.

I hit RunServer.Exe and this comes up....



[IMG]http://i43.tinypic.com/21nf91j.jpg[/img]


It keeps saying Null, millions of times.
I just showed the top of the window, to show what it says, before it says Null.

I only blanked out the server name.



Edit: Im hearing its a simple Anti-Leecher mechinism.

I am looking through the Client.Java, And I have found...

[code]
	/* MISC */
	public int i;

	private java.io.InputStream in; //private java.io.DataInputStream in;
	private java.io.OutputStream out; //private java.io.DataOutputStream out;

	public stream inStream = null, outStream = null;

	public Cryption inStreamDecryption = null, outStreamDecryption = null;

	private java.net.Socket mySock;


	public int KillerId = playerId;

public void lowGFX(int id, int delay) {
mask100var1 = id;
mask100var2 = delay;
mask100update = true;
updateRequired = true;
}
public void specGFX(int gfx) { [/code]


could something in here, be the reason for it?

I say outstream Null, in Java..

I haven&#39;t used private servers in years, I&#39;m just trying to start one up again.





Also, If I try compiling the server, this comes up... If this helps any..

So I went in Client.Java, and I found the spot here....

[code]
        if(TzWave == 20)
        {
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2741, 2381, 5106, heightLevel)
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2630, 2406, 5071, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2627, 2383, 5069, heightLevel);
            NeededKills = 69;
        } [/code] 



But if I replace that with 


[code]        if(TzWave == 20)
        {
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2741, 2381, 5106, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2630, 2406, 5071, heightLevel);
            server.npcHandler.spawnANPC(2627, 2383, 5069, heightLevel);
            NeededKills = 69;
        } [/code]


Which, In theory, should Fix the problem.


I get this error when I compile the server....

Please dont sit here and say &quot;its anti-leech for a reason, so you can fix it on your own!!&quot;


Im trying to..
And I did what in theory should work, and it didnt work..


Im not a leecher thats just trying to take someone elses server and run it as my own, im actually trying to do this on my own, and I am stuck..</description>
