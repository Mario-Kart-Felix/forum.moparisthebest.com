<p>Slipknot (sometimes typeset as SlipKnoT to fit their logo) is an American heavy metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. The nine-piece formed in 1995 and are currently signed to Roadrunner Records.[3]</p>
<p>Their albums and home videos have achieved platinum sales status.[1] The band’s Grammy award nominations include Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance, which their song, “Before I Forget”, won after six successive years of nomination.[4]</p>
<p>Kerrang! Magazine recently interviewed Slipknot drummer Joey Jordison, who revealed some tasty insights into their next album:</p>
<p>“It’s going to be heavy as fuck!” promised Jordison. “It’s going to be heavier than ‘Vol. 3…’ but just as weird and as experimental. We have a whole bunch of song titles, but nothing I wanna say right now.”</p>
<p>The sticksman - currently filling in for Korn drummer David Silveria, who has been on hiatus from the Bakersfield nu-metallers since the beginning of the year - will be touring with the band until October.</p>
<p>“I’m having a blast out on the road,” Jordison told Kerrang!. “I’ll be on the whole Family Values (also featuring Trivium) run in the U.S. with Korn over the summer and we’ve got some Brazilian dates in August and September. The Korn guys are really laid back and the shows have been killer, but in October we’ll be starting a new Slipknot chapter.”</p>
<p>Slipknot are due begin recording their fifth studio album in January:</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to the other guys a bunch of times over the last few months about the new album,” he explained to Kerrang!. “I’ve told them to demo whatever they can so we’ve got as much material to chose from as possible. So be warned 2008 is going to be all about Slipknot!”</p>
<p>Slipknot’s latest release, 2006’s 2-DVD set Voliminal: Inside the Nine, has already gone GOLD in America -  pick up your copy now, if you haven’t already![br][size=1]Posted on: August 11, 2007, 01:39:15 PM[/size][hr][quote=“exe626, post:40, topic:119929”][quote author=Speljohan link=topic=169362.msg1662719#msg1662719 date=1186684448]</p>

<p>Slipknot is Nu-Metal. It doesn’t matter what the internet says, because they are. Just listen to it. No Thrash elements anywhere at all. And if you feel the internet is right in this question, let’s take a look at wikipedia. What does the genre say? let me quote it for you:</p>
<blockquote>Alternative metal
Heavy metal
Nu metal
Rapcore</blockquote>
<p>And in my opinion, heavy metal can’t possibly fit in there because heavy metal involves falsette screaming.</p>
<p>And regarding the second quote:<br>
“most of these people are just emo and cant take screaming on there softie ears its quite pathetic if u ask me”<br>
that made me think “oh, so he think slipknot is so hard because the singer scream?” It felt to me like he stereotyped everyone who doesn’t like slipknot.</p>
