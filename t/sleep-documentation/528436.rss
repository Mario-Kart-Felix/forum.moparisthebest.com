    <title>Sleep documentation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sleep-documentation/528436</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, and welcome to my [i]sleep documentation[/i] thread. I have been very interested in the research of sleeping patterns, and school has started back, so I figured I would do various tests to minimize the time I sleep, but maximize the efficiency of the sleep. According to various sources, the refreshment of the sleep is not determined by the length of the sleep, but the timing of when you wake up during your sleep cycles, which should always be [i]between[/i] your sleeping cycles, in which a human should go through 5-6 cycles which last 90 minutes each. These are not facts, so please do not flame about them being true or not, but please acknowledge that these have been determined through research, which is completely biased depending on the person.

Anyways, now to move onto the actual documentation. I have always had issues with sleeping, almost never getting a good night&#39;s rest, because I do one of the following:

[ul][li]Sleep [i]too much[/i][/li]
	[li]Sleep [i]too little[/i][/li][/ul]
Below, I will have a code block dedicated to the documentation of each night of sleep I get. The format will be the same as follows; [i]date[/i]: [i]sleep start[/i] - [i]sleep end[/i] | [i]sleep cycles[/i] - [i]SUCCESS/FAILURE[/i]:
[code]
8/18/2013: 1:30AM - 6:00AM | 3 - SUCCESS
8/19/2013: 1:30AM - 6:00AM | 3
[/code]

I am aware that there are various things that effect sleep, and I will take those into consideration once I have tested each sleeping cycle, so I can see which will be a reasonable pattern to start off with. Feel free to post your thoughts/results if you are interested in this certain topic.

[b]Information to undergo your own research:[/b]

[ul][li]Sleep cycles usually last around 90 minutes[/li]
	[li]The average amount of sleep cycles required to have the &#39;best&#39; sleep is generally 5-6[/li]
	[li]The average amount of time it takes to fall asleep is 14 minutes.[/li]
	[li]Timing greatly affects the efficiency of your sleep pattern. [/li][/ul]

For example: If you are scheduled to go to sleep at 1:30, make sure you are in the bed and attempt to sleep as soon as the clock strikes 1:16, which will allow the 14 minutes for you to fall asleep, which will help prevent you from waking in the middle of a sleep cycle.</description>

              <p>Surprisingly, I slept really good last night and woke up feeling refreshed. I started my day with a coffee and cereal, and then headed off to school. I saw no signs of performance loss, and I was able to center my focus on each and every class. After school, I worked out and then headed off to work. I just got back from work, and I have some studying to do for some tests, so I will actually stay up till 1:30 again and wake up at 6:00, and hopefully this will help me determine if this pattern is right for me. Eventually, I will try to mix it up every night until I find the best results.</p>

<p>I don’t see how this would prove to be a huge impact on the tests.</p>

I provided this example to show how I will be conducting these tests. It shouldn't take me any longer than 20 minutes to fall asleep, and that is pretty far fetched.
<p>But yes, technology would most likely provide the best results.</p>
