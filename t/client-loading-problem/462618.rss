    <title>Client loading problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-loading-problem/462618</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been experiencing some difficulties with my client, there&#39;s something wrong with it when the loading screen is about to show. I&#39;ve tried restarting the client, closing all Java applications manually through the task manager and running it again but still nothing. This is what it shows.

I would highly appreciate it if someone would explain how to fix this, thank you.</description>
