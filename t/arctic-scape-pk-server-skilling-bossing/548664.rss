    <description>Hello, The server is still under construction as of now but yo can still make cash and boss + skill + PK!

Info: This server is a client + source off of Aggroth that I&quot;m remodeling and putting in my own ideas to make it a pk server with bossing and skilling

Staff: Currently i have no moderators or Server helpers so im always looking for active and friendly staff that will get the job done.

Features:

PKING

I added pking in camelot &quot;Spawn&quot; Right outside as i said its a pking server.

BOSSIG

I&#39;ve added a couple bosses with better drop rates, The drop rates as of now are only 1 in 20 - 1 in 25 depending on which boss! and yes you can solo them besides nomad, you might have to have 1 partner

Penguins

I&#39;ve added penguins that drop 5m each kill, and 1 in 8 chance of dropping a crystal key which will give u anything from dh worth 30m to mystery box that can give u a chance to get 30m-santa hat worth 1.5b
