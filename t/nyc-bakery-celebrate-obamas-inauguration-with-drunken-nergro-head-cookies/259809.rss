    <title>NYC Bakery: Celebrate Obama&#39;s inauguration with &#39;Drunken Nergro Head&#39; cookies!</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A bakery in New York City has caused some controversy as it capitalizes on President Barack Obama&#39;s inauguration. It has baked up some special cookies for customers that depict racist caricatures. Classy.

The trendy Lafayette French Pastry Bakery in Greenwich Village — featured on TV&#39;s Sex and the City — is selling &#39;Drunken Negro Head&#39; cookies — chocolate covered biscuits with huge red eyes, a bulbous nose and extra-large lips. The bakery owner, Ted Kefalinos, claims it&#39;s &quot;just a fun face.&quot; But news reports say he&#39;s used the &quot;N word&quot; with customers when hawking the cookies and made vague, ominous hints of assassination, as the Daily Voice puts it:

    [i]&quot;They&#39;re in honour of our new president,&quot; the baker reportedly told several patrons. &quot;He&#39;s following in the same path of Abraham Lincoln. He will get what&#39;s coming to him.&quot;[/i]

We thought the buttons and ball caps were appropriate souvenirs, when Kenny Yum went shopping here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
