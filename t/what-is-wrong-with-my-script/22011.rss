    <title>What is wrong with my script?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-wrong-with-my-script/22011</link>
    <description>I&#39;m new with scar and I dont know much commands. I made simple scripts that spammed messages in chats and they worked fine. Today I tried something else and now I dont know whats wrong. The script is meant to watch TV over and over again for a game called Stick RPG *C*.

[code]program New;
const    // news=1 fitness=2 Dating=3
Show=1; // pick Your SHOW!!!
var c1,c2 :integer;
procedure whichshow;
begin
If show=1;
Then
c1=395;
c2=360;
If show=2;
then
c1=390;
c2=400;
If show=3;
then
c1=393;
c2=455;
end;
procedure watch;
 begin
 ClickMouse(496,350, true);   // Watch TV
 wait(300);
 ClickMouse(c1,c2, true);  // Watch Show
 wait(600);
 ClickMouse(610,494, true);   //click OK
 wait(300);
 end;
procedure watch12;

 ClickMouse(585,483, true);
 wait(1000);
 end;
 procedure STRENGTH;

Can you not just correct my mistake but tell me what I did wrong. Or tell me an easier way to do it.(For example tell me how to add repeats)

<p>To make that script</p>
<p>Use keydown to keep the shift key down(gotta go and find the key numbers list) and then use keydown to move your arrow key. dont forget to use key up when you want to release the key.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>alright i have looked at it now and i have found some things.</p>
<p>first off you should space things out a little more. you had somthing like this:<br>
[scar]<br>
Procedure doit;<br>
begin<br>
whattodo;<br>
end;<br>
procedure doitagain;<br>
begin<br>
whattodo;<br>
end;<br>
[/scar]<br>
it should be more like this<br>
[scar]<br>
Procedure doit;<br>
begin<br>
whattodo;<br>
end;</p>
<p>procedure doitagain;<br>
begin<br>
whattodo;<br>
end;<br>
[/scar]</p>
<p>another thing is your if then statements. first of all put the if and the then on the same line:<br>
[scar]<br>
like this:<br>
if (what) then</p>
<p>not like this:<br>
if (what)<br>
then<br>
[/scar]<br>
also when you use if then statements if you want it to do more than one thing(like how you want it to set 2 coordinats then you have to have it like this:<br>
[scar]<br>
procedure whichshow;<br>
begin<br>
If show=1 Then<br>
begin<br>
c1 := 395;<br>
c2 := 360;<br>
end;<br>
If show=2 then<br>
begin<br>
c1 := 390;<br>
c2 := 400;<br>
end;<br>
If show=3 then<br>
begin<br>
c1 := 393;<br>
c2 := 455;<br>
end;<br>
end;<br>
[/scar]<br>
otherwise it will change the c2 coord to 455 no matter what.</p>
<p>the third thing is repeating. you can take out your procedure watch12 and use a repeat in the main loop. since you said you dont know how i will teach you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>the basis of repeating is you have a repeat, somehting you want to do, then until when. like this:<br>
[scar]<br>
repeat<br>
somthing;<br>
until(youwanttostop)<br>
[/scar]</p>
<p>for your script you want to repeat watch 12 times. to do this the first thing to do is make somthingn that will count how many times you have done this. this is very simple. we will add w := w+1 to the end of your prodecure(you also have to add w as a variable integer). this will add one to w each time it is done. then we want it to stop watching at 1 so we use this in out main loop:<br>
[scar]<br>
repeat<br>
watch;<br>
until(w = 12)<br>
[/scar]<br>
this will stop it at 12 times</p>
<p>Finaly you dont need the strength procedure you just use repeats in your main loop. here is the finished revised script:<br>
[scar]<br>
program StickRPG;</p>
<p>const                         // news=1 fitness=2 Dating=3<br>
Show=1;                       // pick Your SHOW!!!<br>
howmany=12;                   // how many times you want to watch then sleep</p>
<p>var<br>
c1,c2,w,s :integer;</p>
<p>procedure whichshow;<br>
begin<br>
If show=1 Then<br>
begin<br>
c1 := 395;<br>
c2 := 360;<br>
end;<br>
If show=2 then<br>
begin<br>
c1 := 390;<br>
c2 := 400;<br>
end;<br>
If show=3 then<br>
begin<br>
c1 := 393;<br>
c2 := 455;<br>
end;<br>
end;</p>
<p>procedure watch;<br>
begin<br>
ClickMouse(496,350, true);   // Watch TV<br>
wait(300);<br>
ClickMouse(c1,c2, true);  // Watch Show<br>
wait(600);<br>
ClickMouse(610,494, true);   //click OK<br>
wait(300);<br>
w := w+1<br>
end;</p>
<p>procedure sleep;<br>
begin<br>
ClickMouse(321,405, true);<br>
wait(500)<br>
ClickMouse(585,483, true);<br>
wait(1000);<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
whichshow;<br>
wait(3000);<br>
repeat<br>
repeat<br>
watch;<br>
until(w = 12)<br>
sleep;<br>
s := s+1<br>
until(s = howmany)<br>
end.<br>
[/scar]</p>
<p>some other things is i added the const howmany so you set how many times you want it to do alll of this. another thing is when you want to tell scar what the value of a variable is you use w := 3 not w=3 because w=3 is asking if w is 3 not telling it.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 04, 2006, 02:11:14 PM[/size][hr]haha i guess i fixed alot… pm me if you need anymore help or msn me: <a href="mailto:troy.cos@hotmail.com">troy.cos@hotmail.com</a></p>
