    <title>Me And Friends Are Making Stunt Group</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/me-and-friends-are-making-stunt-group/117801</link>
    <description>Hi.

     Whether you know it or not, almost everyone who reads this is a huge part of my life. I have my opinions on all of you, good or bad. Mopar is a huge part of my life, and I value everyones opinion on here. Hell, you guys were the first ones that I told about me switching religions. That was probably one of the biggest steps in my life to date, and you guys were the first to know, even before my real life friends. Now, I&#39;m asking for your guys&#39; and girls&#39; opinion on something me and my friends are doing in real life. I don&#39;t know if anyone had ever heard of CKY, or JackAss, or any other stunt group, but when me and my friends are together, we are always doing crazy things. We plan to start filming in 3 weeks, when one of my friends gets back from vacation in Maine. Me and my  friends have wracked our brains for names, but we can&#39;t think of any. We&#39;ve got tons of stunt ideas, and some gimmicks to. Mostly, for our first film, were just gonna do funny stuff, not TO dangerous. We do this stuff anyways, but we figure why not gain the popular points, and be able to show it to friends later. 

Here Are Some Stunt Ideas:

[ul][li]Throwing black cat fireworks at people when they walk their dogs [/li]
[li]&quot;Testing&quot; the showers and toilets in home depot[/li]
[li]Mooning people.[/li]
[li]Drive-by Insults (except were on bikes so it&#39;s 10x funnier)[/li]
[li]Waiting until newspaper delivery lady comes, and run along side her car, naked.[/li]
[li]Streaking down main roads, in 5 &#39;o clock traffic[/li]
[li]Jumping out of the back of trucks at 30mph into bushes[/li]
[li]Breaking fluorescent lightbulbs over our bare backs[/li] 
[li]Climbing up trees, and the chopping them down when were in them[/li][/ul]


Those are just a few, we&#39;ve done all of them except the last one, only because we just thought of it last night. We figure to give it our own touch, in every vid, there will be SOME form of pain/streaking. Yeah, this is highly immature, but this is my last grip on fun. Maybe do a bunch of stuff in hot pink ski masks(My friend has a ski mask fetish). Anyways, were looking for stunt and name ideas. If you guys have any NICE feedback, please post, or ideas.

Thanks for reading,

Buzzy</description>

Wrong, again. If your going to profile someone, at least make sure your suspicions are correct before you publish them for everyone to see your mistakes. I don’t need to try to look cool, simply because I don’t give a fuck what you, or anyone else thinks of me, otherwise don’t you think I would have flamed back to every pathetic attempt of some idiot who tries to offend me even though I told them not to even try. In fact, I posted here asking for ideas because Mopar is a huge part of my life. Then, people told me they wanted to see them, and I promised they could after they’re filmed/edited. Now, I don’t want this thread locked because people like you try to tempt me into stooping to your level by flaming back… and my intelligent responses may be mistaken as just that, so if you want to kept this debate up, PM me?[br][size=1]Posted on: June 29, 2007, 03:47:39 PM[/size][hr][quote=".Flair, post:17, topic:117801"]I’ll produce the film, add sound effects, subtitles etc… and build you an entire website… It’ll all come from me, so since I don’t know you personally wtf they gonna do about it :P[/quote]<br>
Sorry, just saw this post. No thanks, I do all my own tech work. But thanks a lot for the offer =)</p>

Hi.</p>
<pre><code> Whether you know it or not, almost everyone who reads this is a huge part of my life. I have my opinions on all of you, good or bad. Mopar is a huge part of my life, and I value everyones opinion on here. Hell, you guys were the first ones that I told about me switching religions. That was probably one of the biggest steps in my life to date, and you guys were the first to know, even before my real life friends. Now, I'm asking for your guys' and girls' opinion on something me and my friends are doing in real life. I don't know if anyone had ever heard of CKY, or JackAss, or any other stunt group, but when me and my friends are together, we are always doing crazy things. We plan to start filming in 3 weeks, when one of my friends gets back from vacation in Maine. Me and my  friends have wracked our brains for names, but we can't think of any. We've got tons of stunt ideas, and some gimmicks to. Mostly, for our first film, were just gonna do funny stuff, not TO dangerous. We do this stuff anyways, but we figure why not gain the popular points, and be able to show it to friends later. 
</code></pre>
<p>Here Are Some Stunt Ideas:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Throwing black cat fireworks at people when they walk their dogs [/li]<br>
[li]“Testing” the showers and toilets in home depot[/li]<br>
[li]Mooning people.[/li]<br>
[li]Drive-by Insults (except were on bikes so it’s 10x funnier)[/li]<br>
[li]Waiting until newspaper delivery lady comes, and run along side her car, naked.[/li]<br>
[li]Streaking down main roads, in 5 'o clock traffic[/li]<br>
[li]Jumping out of the back of trucks at 30mph into bushes[/li]<br>
[li]Breaking fluorescent lightbulbs over our bare backs[/li]<br>
[li]Climbing up trees, and the chopping them down when were in them[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Those are just a few, we’ve done all of them except the last one, only because we just thought of it last night. We figure to give it our own touch, in every vid, there will be SOME form of pain/streaking. Yeah, this is highly immature, but this is my last grip on fun. Maybe do a bunch of stuff in hot pink ski masks(My friend has a ski mask fetish). Anyways, were looking for stunt and name ideas. If you guys have any NICE feedback, please post, or ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
<p>Buzzy</p>
<p>Haha cant wait,really looking forward to this,try your best to entertain us <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> As well as dont get caught by the cops.<br>
