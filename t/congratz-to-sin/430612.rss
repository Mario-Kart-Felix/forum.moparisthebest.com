While we’re on this discussion, reverse engineering still takes extensive knowledge of the language which is enough to categorize someone as very good/expert.</p>
<p>Since when was this site an official certification giver of the java language lol? The award is given to people who have gone out of their way to learn alot, more than any normal forum member would.</p>
<p>Look at my art quality when I got graphics master 3 years ago, I wasn’t top notch but I wasn’t experimenting either.<br>
[/quote]i think the Java Coder award should be used for those with good Java abilities, and a reverse engineer award should be given to those who are good at reverse engineering. however, as i stated before, reverse engineering is still a specific field and gives a fair amount of knowledge of the language, but not nearly enough to qualify anyone as a guru as that should be used exclusively for those who have applied their java skills outside of reverse engineering the client for more advanced topics that a typical software engineer is more likely to tackle. calling someone a guru for simply knowing the language and hacking the client is absurd, being completely honest.</p>
<p>also, if you look around, you’ll find lots of people who have evidently given up lots of their time into learning something (programming section has a good few). however, MITB is most impressed with people displaying good reverse engineering knowledge, it seems. anyone outside of that clique seems to get disregarded.</p>
<p>i don’t know the circumstances in which you were given Graphics Master, but i’m sure you’ve put as much time into your graphics as many people have into their programming. luckily you were given recognition, but many people haven’t yet evidently should have.</p>

[/quote]I think it’s based more on contribution based on what MITB said in reply, rather than actually being really good at the language. So it’s a good way to promote development<br>
[/quote]my general programming knowledge is ok, i guess. my Java skills aren’t extremely good though.</p>
<p>and i wouldn’t mind everything being contribution based, but it still seems quite Java-centric and actual code contributions to the hacking scene seem to be the only things that get regarded.</p>

_s is one of those people who doesn’t question the language or look at it with mystery. Most moparscapers know what a command is, and know what to plugin to it to make it work, but they don’t even understand what the if statement is actually doing.</p>
<p>Once I understood java, the hard stuff was still hard, but damn my server programming was so easy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  Once the mystery was gone from the code I lost interest though. But it helped me make kickass e2 scripts in garrys mod.</p>
<p>You just “get it”<br>
[/quote]i don’t question languages purely because all languages are essentially the same thing. sure, some complexities arise when dealing with logical programming languages in contrast to imperative languages but it’s all essentially the same, and there’s always documentation, books and tutorials available for anyone who wants to understand something. it seems like an especially strange case to get bored of programming purely because the mystery element is taken out though, i always like to think of programming languages as tools that can be used to express ones creativity, and becoming proficient with the tool can only further ones curiousity into finding the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>

<p>I believe I said exactly this about five different ways except for the second bit. Personal belief is that I was noticed for something but I never received any indication as to what that was. He has only posted on one of my threads and that was more of an idea thread than anything. Anyway, I don’t really think we can mark up a feasible measuring stick. I have asked t4 and _s for help on some of my Evelus projects although they didn’t exactly tell me what to do and in the end I just heeded their advice. So that is maybe why they are a bit upset, dunno. I think it is more about contributing and helping people move forward than actually just showing that you know the language. Practical use versus being a text book.</p>
<p>[/quote]for your Evelus project i contributed a lot of constructive criticism, just look at the general architecture and configuration systems that i suggested and critiqued; i think you’re blinding yourself to certain things. i essentially told you how to implement several things quite concisely and specifically, but i think it’s the completely wrong stance to take if you expect us to spoonfeed you everything so you don’t have to think. the point of being a software engineer is to flex things (design patterns, ideas and languages) and work with them to create things, using things as a rule of thumb and using your intuition and knowledge to solve a problem rather than relying on others to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>i seriously see your argument as just an argument in favour of spoonfeeding and doing everything for everyone else. if this isn’t the case, please clarify.[/quote]</p>
<p>I brought it up because I thought it’d be a valid point for the argument.  Talked to _s and he does have some good points. But anyway, thank you all and I hope that I can help the community more in the coming months.</p>

An award or w.e. should have certain standards the person receiving the reward must meet, they should not be compared to others who have obtained that reward as there may be exceptional people who have gained the award also. However, I have no idea what any ones achievements on this site are tbh so it may not be relevant in this situation as publication and forth of work may not be public, yadayada etcetcetc.<br>
[/quote]Problem is, there are no set ‘standards’. I would love there to be some, but MITB has never been clear. And as much as I would like to ‘not compare them’, especially here, once you get an award, you immediately get branded as one of them and thought of the same way to anyone that doesn’t know the history.</p>

[/quote]We’re both frustrated, there are people that qualify more as ‘gurus’ than reverse engineers. See my reply to kidpaparoach as well.</p>

Do you know how much knowledge it takes to mess around with the client? Its more complex than writing your own program x10. You know reverse engineers are the ones that created bots right? In fact, 2 very skilled programmers from this site made 3-7$ MILLION USD in the past 2 years because of a bot they semi created. If it is the same as server “coders” then why haven’t any of you done it?<br>
[/quote]Java knowledge is a lot different than knowledge of what you are working with. Those programmers had excellent understanding of what they were dealing with (the client), I don’t think _s or myself would ever claim to know that much about the client. They really are completely different categories, and I think I can say that _s would agree, we probably could write the basis of a bot as long as we didn’t have to actually add the hooks into the client, because that part is pretty simple. In the case of bots though, you probably could count those as Java gurus, because you need to understand all the other concepts that go along with injection, applet loading, etc, as well.</p>

<p>I love me some good old clusterfucked code to try and understand.<br>
[/quote]Perfect example, no matter how much you know Java, you can’t reverse engineer that without knowing what all those variables are by looking at the client itself. Once you refactor, it becomes relatively easy to do even with only moderate java knowledge. And finding out what variables do is just following the trail until you hit something recognizable. There are many people that can do this, which is the foundation of RSPS’s today. Look at the client hacking section, there are quite a few things there. Any cache editor, and (the first) custom item/interface/npcs were all good examples, but why aren’t they Java gurus? No one is trying to belittle you or your work, like _s said it can be difficult without excellent understanding of how the client works.</p>
<p>There’s no point crying over spilled milk, the chances of sinisouls award changing is low unless he requests it, but hopefully maybe we can come up with something to effect the future.</p>

<p>Go make a java program that downloads the current runescape loader, decipher the game pack in the loader jar, load all the classes into a byte code editor of your choice and then decipher all the strings in the classes, finally replace their array references by replacing the load field instruction with a load constant instruction. Easiest (useful) deobfuscation project you can do. That project alone is more difficult than creating the basis of a bot. Also note that some of the pieces of creating the basis of a bot was included in the steps for the project.</p>
<p>Anyway, David if you want to continue to discuss let’s do so via PM/IRC.[/quote]that’s a typical reverse engineering task that you’ve set up; i see knowledge of encryption and decryption and bytecode engineering applicable here. however, this is exactly the type of challenge that shouldn’t qualify someone as a java guru, for how much specific java and software engineering knowledge is required here? decryption is a general security topic often practiced in reverse engineering circles and the bytecode challenge presented doesn’t really dive out of the reverse engineering discipline either, albeit it’s a little bit more java-esque. perhaps Davidi2 was being a little bit shortsighted when mentioning bot bases as a good indicator of general Java knowledge, perhaps he should have mentioned something not far off the scale or complexity of RSBuddy or RSBot instead, where knowledge of advanced reverse engineering, computer security, AI to a degree, computer graphics and software architecture are essential.</p>

<p>The hardest part my instructor said of the first semester was recursion…[/quote]recursion is a very easy concept to nail down, but the difficulties in it actually root themselves in thinking recursively; most programmers starting with imperative languages will always think iteratively in loops, rather than in terms of functions calling themselves which can make designing more complex recursive solutions hard for someone who seldom requires or works with a recursive solution. various problems are well-expressed recursively, such as tree traversal, and these are generally language-agnostic optimal solutions, but when working with a functional language which forces recursion upon you (Haskell, ML, Erlang, Lisp to an extent) you may find something easy to express as a loop can be complex to express recursively. i guess you could argue that functional languages are at a disadvantage here because of having to express everything recursively, but some problems expressed recursively in imperative languages are either overly inefficient or too liable to blow the call stack, in the absence of tail-call elimination/optimisation.</p>

<p>I hope it is a joke but I took regular Java and that was really easy and I didn’t really learn anything but i’ve heard from other kids who are actually really smart that the class is really hard. O well, I hope your right davyyypoo</p>

An award or w.e. should have certain standards the person receiving the reward must meet, they should not be compared to others who have obtained that reward as there may be exceptional people who have gained the award also.

[/quote]Problem is, there are no set ‘standards’. I would love there to be some, but MITB has never been clear.

Do you know how much knowledge it takes to mess around with the client? Its more complex than writing your own program x10. You know reverse engineers are the ones that created bots right? In fact, 2 very skilled programmers from this site made 3-7$ MILLION USD in the past 2 years because of a bot they semi created. If it is the same as server “coders” then why haven’t any of you done it?<br>
[/quote]Java knowledge is a lot different than knowledge of what you are working with. Those programmers had excellent understanding of what they were dealing with (the client), I don’t think _s or myself would ever claim to know that much about the client. They really are completely different categories, and I think I can say that _s would agree, we probably could write the basis of a bot as long as we didn’t have to actually add the hooks into the client, because that part is pretty simple. In the case of bots though, you probably could count those as Java gurus, because you need to understand all the other concepts that go along with injection, applet loading, etc, as well.</p>

<p>I love me some good old clusterfucked code to try and understand.<br>
[/quote]Perfect example, no matter how much you know Java, you can’t reverse engineer that without knowing what all those variables are by looking at the client itself. Once you refactor, it becomes relatively easy to do even with only moderate java knowledge. And finding out what variables do is just following the trail until you hit something recognizable. There are many people that can do this, which is the foundation of RSPS’s today. Look at the client hacking section, there are quite a few things there. Any cache editor, and (the first) custom item/interface/npcs were all good examples, but why aren’t they Java gurus? No one is trying to belittle you or your work, like _s said it can be difficult without excellent understanding of how the client works.</p>
<p>There’s no point crying over spilled milk, the chances of sinisouls award changing is low unless he requests it, but hopefully maybe we can come up with something to effect the future.</p>

<p>Go make a java program that downloads the current runescape loader, decipher the game pack in the loader jar, load all the classes into a byte code editor of your choice and then decipher all the strings in the classes, finally replace their array references by replacing the load field instruction with a load constant instruction. Easiest (useful) deobfuscation project you can do. That project alone is more difficult than creating the basis of a bot. Also note that some of the pieces of creating the basis of a bot was included in the steps for the project.</p>
<p>Anyway, David if you want to continue to discuss let’s do so via PM/IRC.<br>

              <p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:46, topic:430612”]An award or w.e. should have certain standards the person receiving the reward must meet, they should not be compared to others who have obtained that reward as there may be exceptional people who have gained the award also. However, I have no idea what any ones achievements on this site are tbh so it may not be relevant in this situation as publication and forth of work may not be public, yadayada etcetcetc.[/quote]Problem is, there are no set ‘standards’. I would love there to be some, but MITB has never been clear. And as much as I would like to ‘not compare them’, especially here, once you get an award, you immediately get branded as one of them and thought of the same way to anyone that doesn’t know the history.</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:52, topic:430612”]ITT: _s is jelly[/quote]We’re both frustrated, there are people that qualify more as ‘gurus’ than reverse engineers. See my reply to kidpaparoach as well.</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:49, topic:430612”]Do you know how much knowledge it takes to mess around with the client? Its more complex than writing your own program x10. You know reverse engineers are the ones that created bots right? In fact, 2 very skilled programmers from this site made 3-7$ MILLION USD in the past 2 years because of a bot they semi created. If it is the same as server “coders” then why haven’t any of you done it?[/quote]Java knowledge is a lot different than knowledge of what you are working with. Those programmers had excellent understanding of what they were dealing with (the client), I don’t think _s or myself would ever claim to know that much about the client. They really are completely different categories, and I think I can say that _s would agree, we probably could write the basis of a bot as long as we didn’t have to actually add the hooks into the client, because that part is pretty simple. In the case of bots though, you probably could count those as Java gurus, because you need to understand all the other concepts that go along with injection, applet loading, etc, as well.</p>

I love me some good old clusterfucked code to try and understand.[/quote]Perfect example, no matter how much you know Java, you can’t reverse engineer that without knowing what all those variables are by looking at the client itself. Once you refactor, it becomes relatively easy to do even with only moderate java knowledge. And finding out what variables do is just following the trail until you hit something recognizable. There are many people that can do this, which is the foundation of RSPS’s today. Look at the client hacking section, there are quite a few things there. Any cache editor, and (the first) custom item/interface/npcs were all good examples, but why aren’t they Java gurus? No one is trying to belittle you or your work, like _s said it can be difficult without excellent understanding of how the client works.</p>
<p>There’s no point crying over spilled milk, the chances of sinisouls award changing is low unless he requests it, but hopefully maybe we can come up with something to effect the future.</p>

              <p>But reverse engineering most of the clients requires a massive amount of knowledge in java? Starting with of course understanding how the VM works and then learning the important operands so you can start searching for basic obfuscation patterns to manipulate instruction stacks?</p>
