Never the less I do appreciate it and wouldn’t give it back, I do believe that my area of expertise is more oriented towards reverse engineering although with the reverse engineering comes some advanced topics that could classify you as a Java guru. Most Java guru people had contributed to the reverse engineering scene in the past and in my view the only way you can go is getting better at whatvyou already do. I wasn’t given a reason as to why I recoeved the badge but I seemed to have cause a bit of a disagreement.</p>
<p>I’d like to see the person who gave me the badge respond to give input. I don’t like the idea of a Java coder rank because that encompasses a lot of people. I’d be happy with a reverse engineering badge or my current one. Its not going to stop me from contributing to moparscape at all.</p>

And yes, a sort of reverse engineering/rs hacking badge is something s1gma suggested on IRC. I dunno if MITB would be up for that though.</p>

<p>[quote author=sinisoul link=topic=533287.msg3898500#msg3898500 date=1327540240]<br>
Java title doesn’t deserve a thread but I appreciate it. Inb4 t4 or s_.<br>
[/quote]can you please drop the reading deficiency and prefix the underscore. also, when did JavA GURU cupzZzz start being given out so easily. sinisoul himself is (was?) unsure of his deserving of it (although he may not want to admit this in public), and Dx2 is just a monkey that begs for/leeches ideas from various people and expects everything to be given to him mainly because he has no initiative (i’ve been a target of this -_-). on the other hand, there are various people who deserve more recognition (the programming section has some notable talent).<br>
[/quote]I personally think this would be a good time to start using the moparscape award ‘java coder’, for people whose talents are fine tuned towards RS development, understanding the RS client, reverse engineering it, etc. Perfect example being sinisoul. I don’t think anyone here would deny that he does have a pretty good understanding of those things, but when you think about who had the Java guru award in the past, it doesn’t really compare in the ‘all around’ level (frank, super, Taharok, etc). Not to mention we need a reason to start using the Java coder award. I think it would be really cool of sinisoul if he asked MITB to change his award to Java Coder, though I could understand if he didn’t want to.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ah didn’t read this entirely. Am I the only one who finds it unjust you are comparing me with the other people who have received the rank and saying that you think that I don’t deserve it? Food for thought. Of course you didn’t say it in that context but it was slightly offending in my eyes. It’s safe to say I was given it for a reason and I never received reason why so I was eventually going to wait out the shit storm (moment I saw the image I knew there would be one) and talk to one of the administrators when the time was right. Out of all the ideas posted I’d actually enjoy a reverse engineering sort of rank but would it really be worth to create a rank for such a small category? It’s all up in the air and I’ll just be waiting it out until I hear from someone who has more of a say on this than David.</p>

<p>[quote author=Davidi2 link=topic=533287.msg3899089#msg3899089 date=1327600893]<br>
I think Java Coder could encompass that, and still indicate good knowledge of java.</p>
<p>It’s not really a step down from ‘guru’, just a step to the side showing what your real talent is.<br>
[/quote]i still think it’s a bit ambiguously named, it appears as more of a step down than a specialisation. renaming it may have benefits.<br>
[/quote]Maybe sinisoul will have input? I dunno what would appeal to his specialization more[/quote]<br>
torture him to compliance[/quote]</p>
<p>When the fuck haven’t you done this, s1gma?</p>

An award or w.e. should have certain standards the person receiving the reward must meet, they should not be compared to others who have obtained that reward as there may be exceptional people who have gained the award also. However, I have no idea what any ones achievements on this site are tbh so it may not be relevant in this situation as publication and forth of work may not be public, yadayada etcetcetc.</p>

<p>Java title doesn’t deserve a thread but I appreciate it. Inb4 t4 or s_.<br>
[/quote]can you please drop the reading deficiency and prefix the underscore. also, when did JavA GURU cupzZzz start being given out so easily. sinisoul himself is (was?) unsure of his deserving of it (although he may not want to admit this in public), and Dx2 is just a monkey that begs for/leeches ideas from various people and expects everything to be given to him mainly because he has no initiative (i’ve been a target of this -_-). on the other hand, there are various people who deserve more recognition (the programming section has some notable talent).<br>
[/quote]I personally think this would be a good time to start using the moparscape award ‘java coder’, for people whose talents are fine tuned towards RS development, understanding the RS client, reverse engineering it, etc. Perfect example being sinisoul. I don’t think anyone here would deny that he does have a pretty good understanding of those things, but when you think about who had the Java guru award in the past, it doesn’t really compare in the ‘all around’ level (frank, super, Taharok, etc). Not to mention we need a reason to start using the Java coder award. I think it would be really cool of sinisoul if he asked MITB to change his award to Java Coder, though I could understand if he didn’t want to.</p>

<p>Ah didn’t read this entirely. Am I the only one who finds it unjust you are comparing me with the other people who have received the rank and saying that you think that I don’t deserve it? Food for thought. Of course you didn’t say it in that context but it was slightly offending in my eyes. It’s safe to say I was given it for a reason and I never received reason why so I was eventually going to wait out the shit storm (moment I saw the image I knew there would be one) and talk to one of the administrators when the time was right. Out of all the ideas posted I’d actually enjoy a reverse engineering sort of rank but would it really be worth to create a rank for such a small category? It’s all up in the air and I’ll just be waiting it out until I hear from someone who has more of a say on this than David.[/quote]<br>
there are a lot of reverse engineers on mscp/mitb who have been given java awards purely for being reverse engineers with knowledge of the client, which is a little bit odd considering some of them probably don’t know java as well as one may expect of someone who is supposedly a ‘guru’.</p>

<p>By the way I mean the real rs client, not these garbage private server clients/servers[/quote]congratulations you have a remarkably firm grasp of the reality of a reverse engineer (not a software engineer), and that’s why reverse engineering deserves its own rank! just because someone is a proficient reverse engineer doesn’t mean they’re a java guru as that should imply actual skills in a multitude of fields that relate to java and software engineering in general, not just reverse engineering. of course, one can learn many things from reversing the client and it can definitely be difficult but i think you overestimate the difficulty in comparison to certain brands of native reverse engineering, which can get extremely tricky when you’re dealing with popular commercial games and applications, as well as the evils of extremely aggressive optimisation/convolution and obfuscation tools like themida (security oriented VM yay!). i would be much more willing to drop my argument once jagex actually dive into the dreaded realm of protecting themselves from hackers and crackers (let’s hope the next big fat obfuscation update Jacmob’s pulling out of his rectum does the trick).</p>
<p>and please don’t assume that i’m a fucking moron and don’t know who and what created the bots and made all the money, and please don’t ever umbrella me under the term “server coder” that is just embarrassing on both our behalves. i never said that server development and client hacking required the same skills, modern day server development is something undertaken, ran and kept alive by morons, for morons. working with the client is much more difficult, but much more specialised and much more specific. that alone should separate it from the java guru rank, even without taking into the account the relatively inexperienced java programmers but experienced client hackers (of which i’m sure sinisoul won’t mind being grouped into as he knows i can be a very helpful soul when asked nicely).</p>

Those programmers had excellent understanding of what they were dealing with (the client), I don’t think _s or myself would ever claim to know that much about the client. They really are completely different categories, and I think I can say that _s would agree, we probably could write the basis of a bot as long as we didn’t have to actually add the hooks into the client, because that part is pretty simple. In the case of bots though, you probably could count those as Java gurus, because you need to understand all the other concepts that go along with injection, applet loading, etc, as well.</p>

I love me some good old clusterfucked code to try and understand.[/quote]Perfect example, no matter how much you know Java, you can’t reverse engineer that without knowing what all those variables are by looking at the client itself. Once you refactor, it becomes relatively easy to do even with only moderate java knowledge. And finding out what variables do is just following the trail until you hit something recognizable. There are many people that can do this, which is the foundation of RSPS’s today. Look at the client hacking section, there are quite a few things there. Any cache editor, and (the first) custom item/interface/npcs were all good examples, but why aren’t they Java gurus? No one is trying to belittle you or your work, like _s said it can be difficult without excellent understanding of how the client works.</p>
<p>There’s no point crying over spilled milk, the chances of sinisouls award changing is low unless he requests it, but hopefully maybe we can come up with something to effect the future.</p>

An award or w.e. should have certain standards the person receiving the reward must meet, they should not be compared to others who have obtained that reward as there may be exceptional people who have gained the award also.

[/quote]Problem is, there are no set ‘standards’. I would love there to be some, but MITB has never been clear.

Do you know how much knowledge it takes to mess around with the client? Its more complex than writing your own program x10. You know reverse engineers are the ones that created bots right? In fact, 2 very skilled programmers from this site made 3-7$ MILLION USD in the past 2 years because of a bot they semi created. If it is the same as server “coders” then why haven’t any of you done it?<br>
[/quote]Java knowledge is a lot different than knowledge of what you are working with. Those programmers had excellent understanding of what they were dealing with (the client), I don’t think _s or myself would ever claim to know that much about the client. They really are completely different categories, and I think I can say that _s would agree, we probably could write the basis of a bot as long as we didn’t have to actually add the hooks into the client, because that part is pretty simple. In the case of bots though, you probably could count those as Java gurus, because you need to understand all the other concepts that go along with injection, applet loading, etc, as well.</p>
