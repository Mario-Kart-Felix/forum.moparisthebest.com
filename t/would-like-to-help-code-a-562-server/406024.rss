    <title>Would like to help code a 562 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-like-to-help-code-a-562-server/406024</link>
    <description>hey i am getting damn bored of 317&#39;s, 97% are leeched and owned by idiots. and for the 3% it is the hardest to become popular while any dumbass can add 43594 to his router, download a pi server, advertise he has torva, nex korasi, and that bullshit and have players immediately.  :eek: :confused:
anyways,
i am good at coding with 317s and i would like to learn to code for 562, so if anyone has a 562 server they need help with i can do basic things i will learn quickly. i am not the guy you are looking for if you have serious problems with your server but if you don&#39;t have time to add everything or whatever the situation may be i can assist you for free, i just want to learn more about rsps and java. there is no catch or anything, i do not expect anything in return, i do not care about a staff position, donations, or anything.</description>
