    <title>Why do functions get removed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-functions-get-removed/137797</link>
    <description>This makes no sense to me, but whenever a new SRL is released, loads of functions are removed and barely any of not none are added, just updated.  So far the srl with Scar 2.03 is my favorite because it has a lot of functions that were very useful but why  is it that whenever SRL is updated, things get removed?

Some example are:
  Only 1 dtm function in DTM.scar in SRL 4 while there are 10 in the older SRL
  Only 12 function in Color.scar in SRL 4 and 37 in the older SRL
  0 AutoTalk.scar function in SRL 4 and 12 in the older SRL
  Only 22 Inventory.scar in SRL 4 and 40 in old SRL

I can continue through everything but it is pointless, the point is that I don&#39;t understand why so much is being removed???

Can someone please tell me why so much has been removed from the older SRL versions?  Its not because of updates because  they are just simple findcolor stuff and count inventory, nothing updates can change.

It is annoying me and eventually SRL will barely have anything inside it lol.  I think the SRL community should group together and make SRL as big as possible making new useful functions and fixing the old ones that don&#39;t work.</description>

<p>37 functions in color.scar of a previous version of SRL, reducing that number to 12 means there was more then 3 functions that would do the same exact thing, its simply not necessary.</p>
<p>The goal of SRL is to create the most efficient methods to accomplish tasks, not several ways to do the same thing.</p>

              <p>How much longer could it possibly take to compile the stuff that was removed, 2 milliseconds?  Ide say add as much as possible to SRL to make scripting easier and makes scripts shorter.</p>

And alot of the functions were pointless, such as FindMSColorTol which is just a simplified version of FindColor</p>
