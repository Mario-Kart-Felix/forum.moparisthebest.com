    <title>Quake Live</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quake-live/193661</link>
    <description>Originally called Quake Zero, got changed to Live

For hardcore gamers, that like competition, gameplay and dont just play games for the graphics. This is a completly free remake of Quake 3, one of the best multiplayer competition game ever. Its a revival of quake 3, with improved gameplay, and more things competitive gamers would like in a game.

It should be a huge game (especially at LAN parties and tournaments)

www.quakelive.com atm its in BETA testing i belive, but comming quite soon.

oh yeh and this is for people who likes playing games that require real skill, very fast paced quick thinking games. Dont expect impressive graphics, no real gamer has played a game for its graphics afaik.</description>

              <p>It’s still in beta, and i play it now and then, has a very nice statistics system over the browser, where you can actually view almost everything that goes on, including look up the worlds best players, see their stats, who they killed/died etc.</p>
