    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED] Locking Topics[Moderators etc]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-denied-locking-topics-moderators-etc/524346</link>
    <description>When you lock a topic cause it&#39;s spam or whatever. Could it be possible to also change the title to like * or something of that matter? Here are my reasons for this:

1) If it was a server then the server could still be technically &quot;advertised&quot; by having the title there.
2) If it was a malicious item and had the name of the server/whatever. Could still be googled and could go to that infected site/whatever.

Edit: addition to this suggestion is found on this post

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,642889.msg4328960.html#msg4328960

[hr]
Another suggestion is to make it when a topic is locked it gets &quot;bumped down&quot; so that way we don&#39;t have a locked topic being seen/as one of the main headlines in that specific/particular board at that time.

Reasons:

1) If for example, the first suggestion isn&#39;t implemented. A person who clicks on new posts for that board, will see the recently locked topic, see the title still there, and yeah... same reason as first then.
[hr]
Another suggestion is to have an &quot;approve/disapprove&quot; mod installed. This mod would regulate what can be seen by regular players. 

Reasons:
1)It would just keep overall the forums looking better I believe. I believe VBulletin comes with a similar system already.</description>

              <p>This is largely staff discretion, and it works fine like that. We have a general rule of thumb in regard to locking topics, and how many should be on each page. There isn’t a coded system that is required for everything, the forum has worked like this since forever and it will continue to do so. Any staff member that doesn’t use * appropriately to block out items such as a malicious link can be contacted and that can be amended, the same applies for too many locked topics or topics locked that people feel should have been removed.</p>

<p>The board is entitled community suggestions because it’s for suggestions (“an idea or plan put forward for consideration”) please don’t mistake a suggestion being turned down in consideration for us blanket banning certain suggestion groups.</p>

Cause it’s the total opposite feeling here. I feel like you have some sort of issue wrong with me. And if you do you really should pm me so we can work it out.</p>
<p>This topic was purely a suggestion I thought of to help make the staff lives better. I have talked to you, to flame, to David, and even a couple of other mods before and all of you have talked about how at times it can be a hassle/the time it takes to do certain tasks.</p>
<p>MITB has already stated that the dedication the Mopar staff bring to the table is purely voluntary and thus I am of the mindset “let’s not waste more time than what’s needed for the volunteers.” If that includes making a system easier for a mod I don’t see the reasoning as to why not implement such an item.</p>
<p>From a production standpoint at that, easier the task is, more that can be done in a days time. More things that can be done by the same person equals less work overall and less people needed.</p>

<p>For your first suggestion, depending on the title moderators may sometimes censor a part of it. Mostly to do with advertising, though.

              <p>For your first suggestion, depending on the title moderators may sometimes censor a part of it. Mostly to do with advertising, though. However, if somebody googles the name of a server <span class="bbcode-u">after</span> a moderator has locked/censored the post and then become infected, that is their own fault for being ridiculous.</p>
<p>For your second suggestion, I actually like that idea. I’d love to see something implemented like this, it’d remove a slight guilt of locking multiple topics in a row within one board.</p>
<p>As for your third one, I’m not quite sure I understand you. If you’re talking about a post approval/moderation mod, then SMF has one by default. See: Moderated users and moderated boards. Posts/topics in those instances require approval</p>

              <p>When you lock a topic cause it’s spam or whatever. Could it be possible to also change the title to like * or something of that matter? Here are my reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>If it was a server then the server could still be technically “advertised” by having the title there.</li>
<li>If it was a malicious item and had the name of the server/whatever. Could still be googled and could go to that infected site/whatever.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: addition to this suggestion is found on this post</p>

<p>[hr]<br>
Another suggestion is to make it when a topic is locked it gets “bumped down” so that way we don’t have a locked topic being seen/as one of the main headlines in that specific/particular board at that time.</p>
<p>Reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If for example, the first suggestion isn’t implemented. A person who clicks on new posts for that board, will see the recently locked topic, see the title still there, and yeah… same reason as first then.<br>
[hr]<br>
Another suggestion is to have an “approve/disapprove” mod installed. This mod would regulate what can be seen by regular players.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reasons:<br>
1)It would just keep overall the forums looking better I believe. I believe VBulletin comes with a similar system already.</p>
