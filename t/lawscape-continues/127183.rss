[center]Yes, lawscape is coming back.
Lawscape has not disappeared for no reason![/center]



Yes, Lawscape is coming back, after months of waiting.

I am the only coder coding the entire server. All work will be done by me. Looking at the client, and using it&#39;s full potential is my goal. No server has expanded into the full functionality of the client Jagex has created. This is what will make a server popular, fun, and addictive. I will make sure every feature, every packet, and frame, will be used and to be used effectively. This will all be complete by next month, or the month after. Definitely before Christmas.

The server has many features already included.
[b]These features include:[/b]
[i]- Anti null.
- Anti cheat.
- NPC Facing you when in combat with you.
- An entirely new AI Engine for NPCs.
- Special bar (Used tutorial for the bar only. Edited it to make it more effective)
- Prayer on/off, Run automatically to WALK when logged out.
- Doors work exactly like runescape. Not one door is glitched.
- Skill levels up to 65000[/i]

The system lawscape uses is completely redesigned by me. The system uses 0 CPU usually, a max of 10, and with my serverGUI, I can easily watch what people do, and monitor the server without logging in.

Lawscape will have many many more features in the future before the release.
[b]These features are:[/b]
[i]- An educational way of playing the game, for young gamers to play and learn.
- Full barrows, just like runescape, but with a twist.
- Castle Wars Medley (Different modes like normal, Deathmatch, Storm the defences, and Kill the Carrier)
- A General-Like minigame where you recruit members to your army (NPCs or players), and command them to destroy the other city.
- All special attacks will have better attacks.
- Full magic with new spells.
- Full quests better than runescape.
- A command-less like Interface
- Uninterrupted gameplay (No Update countdown)
- All skills perfected
- PKing perfected (With NPCs acting like real players and trying to PK you)
- NPCs do player related things
- More to add when I think of them.[/i]

We hope to see you in the future!</description>
