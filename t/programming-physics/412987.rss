    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/programming-physics/412987</link>
    <description>Has anyone done programming physics? For example, have you drawn a 3D ball in a 3D space (x,y,z) and made it bounce? And I&#39;m not talking about using a library, I mean writing it ALL by yourself.

I&#39;m under the assumption that it&#39;s really difficult, maybe I&#39;m wrong though, which is why I&#39;m asking. :P</description>

              <p>We did this exact same thing in one of my programming classes, I can’t remember which class though, either C++/OpenGL, or Python/Panda3D, either way, we had to write all the collision detection code ourselves that worked with any number of any sized spheres in any size box, and it had to collide and bounce correctly against other spheres or the sides of the box.  It’s simple once you get it right, but it’s one of those problems that involves quite a bit of sem-complicated math, and if you get any one thing wrong you may be debugging for hours trying to figure out where the problem is.</p>
<p>There is a formula to use, which of course I don’t remember, do you have that?  I also may have this code someplace, but who knows where…</p>

              <p>The trajectory, angle of impact, and angle of refraction wouldn’t be that hard, ie plotting the course of the ball would be basically the same as in 2d, except you’re adding the z component. Calculating collision to the actual poly is a bit trickier, and if you actually want it to have a bouncing animation, then it could be very complicated, assuming your code animates the ball independent of a precreated animation. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Since you would have what object collided at which point, you apply an force vector against the point, based on the mass and velocity on the two different object.</p>

<p>Collision outcome determination (angle of reflection in this case) != Collision detection[/quote]<br>
That I’m fully aware of. I said when you have full collision data, you just have to apply simple physics.<br>
Angle of reflection, is the opposite of the hit angle relative to the angle of the target plan. Just decide how much energy the object are giving of the air and what it hit and you have a bounce. (And of course apply gravity)</p>
<p>I might be wrong, but it seems that this is an over complicated task.</p>
<p>But if collision detection is easy, I might try to make something like it in 2D.</p>
