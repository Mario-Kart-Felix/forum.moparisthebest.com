- INFO -

Whilst our official Exodus Online standard server isn&#39;t available as it&#39;s still under serious construction, we decided we wanted to spice things up a bit.
We wanted you, the wonderful people you are, to experience the game in the current state. But whilst we wanted to do that, we couldn&#39;t show you all of the features we&#39;re currently developing.

[U][B]So, the solution?:[/B][/U]
Whilst we&#39;re focus on releasing our standard server, we&#39;re thinking about you. We, the team, went to the discussion room and started discussing how we could give you, the fans, a taster.
After a few days of discussing we came up with a way to give you, our wonderful community, a taster. We&#39;ve decided to open an entirely new world. World 2.
World 2 will feature a PvP only (spawning) server. Upon login you will be assigned maximum statistics for all of the available skills. From here you will be able to divulge straight into the battle.

[B][U]You, the community:[/U][/B]
Because you&#39;re the community, you&#39;re the people who playe the game. [U]You[/U] reflect our decision on updates. If you ever have suggestions which will make the game experience more fun for [U]you[/U] then please inform us as we love to base our game around our community and show our community the respect and love they deserve.

[B][U]Features Enabled (for world #2):[/U][/B]
 - Spawning items. *
 - Wilderness dedicated Player vs Player.
 - Abilities.
 - Change passive ability with ease. *
[I]* These are features which will [U]not[/U] be in world #1.[/I]

[B][U]Features Disabled (for world #2):[/U][/B]
 - Regional control.
 - Alliances.
 - Thieving minigame.
 - Various important NPCs.
 - Shop NPCs.
 - Ability quest.
 - Tutorial.
 - Clan Chat.
 - Worldwide PvP. (World 2 will only include wilderness PvP).
 - World loading [U]direct[/U] objects.
 - And many, many more features. [I]Server owners usually say this and it&#39;s not true, but we mean it.[/I]

[B][U]Media:[/U][/B]
[I]This media may not portray the final version. Currently we are in a BETA build.[/I]

[B][U]Notes:[/U][/B]
 - This is [U]not[/U] the final build of world 2.
 - This is world 2 (pvp), not world 1 which was displayed in various other threads.
 - We are aware of a select few models which use incorrect colour swatches, these have been resolved and will be pushed to the live game upon the release of world 1.
 - Sometimes when we update the server you may see a glance of a world 1 feature accidentally, this is due to both worlds running from the same code.
 - The server is loading the objects in the current build of world 2. World 1 is dedicated to client (with server) loading. When world 1 releases we&#39;ll additionally push this into world 2.
 - Staff (moderators), we wont be looking for any staff in the BETA builds. Additionally, we wont be having staff applications. We will seek out those who help the community and show they&#39;re having fun.
 - Staff (administrators), we will [U]never[/U] set someone as an administrator prior to them obtaining moderator status. Administrators will be uncommon as they have many tools to assist them.
 - Certain items wont be support by our server as they either wont be release into the game or server (as of now) no use. In the case that you assume the item is important, feel free to contact us with the ID and we&#39;ll look into it.
 - Weapon and armour stats, whilst we&#39;ve been working hard at setting these to reflect their true data, some we&#39;ve missed. Feel free to inform us which item(s) these are and we&#39;ll look into fixing the stats for [U]you[/U].
 - Frequent updates. Whilst we [U]will[/U] be performing frequent updates to the final build of the game, you may witness an increase of updates during the BETA as we like to work quick and release the updates as soon as we can.
 - Bugs. This is a very early build of our BETA. If you come across any bugs, please report them. We&#39;ll have them looked into. [U]Note: Various skills are currently disabled / do not operate as they should. These will be resolved in the live game.[/U]
 - No spam. We wont be spamming you with messages saying &quot;Vote&quot; and &quot;Donate&quot;. Not in the beta, not in the live game. Play with peace!
 - Suggestions. We [U]love[/U] your ideas. If you have something which you think would be awesome to see in Exodus Online, inform us. We&#39;ll do everything we can to implement it so you can enjoy your experience. [I]Note: There will be things we strictly cannot add/edit for various reasons such as a corruption in the balance.[/I]
