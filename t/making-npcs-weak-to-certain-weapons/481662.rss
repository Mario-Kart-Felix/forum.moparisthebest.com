              <p>^ Not really like that.</p>
<p>To be honest their is a lot involved if you want a system with elements.<br>
You will have to change the every single damage void to include an extra integer, 0 being physical for like melee etc.<br>
and then In the damage void have it be like 3 = fire, then in the npchandler create an if statement that says all of these monsters are week to fire.</p>
<p>Then the monster takes damage equal to 1.3 or something, it’s a lot of coding not something super simple.</p>
<p>if you do a half run at it, your going to have bugs simply due to the npcs hitpoints aren’t going to drop right, or the numbers are going to get displayed wrong, exp won’t get calculated for the extra damage.</p>
<p>There a lot involved.<br>
if your newer, I wouldn’t even try this.</p>
<p>(If your trying to change colors for elements, that requires quite a bit more work.)</p>
