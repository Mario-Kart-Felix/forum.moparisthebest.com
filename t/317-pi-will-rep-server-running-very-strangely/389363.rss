    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-pi-will-rep-server-running-very-strangely/389363</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m running a 317 pi, and I was having a drop party with some of my members today - I dropped about 40 items, there were 15 people on at the time running around grabbing them, and we were experiencing some heavy lag, and after the heavy lag, a disconnect. This seems to happen often, and I&#39;m not sure how to fix it. It never lagged on my old source, could anyone help please?</description>
