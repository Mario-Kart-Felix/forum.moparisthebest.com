    <title>[PI] Need Some Help A.S.A.P Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-some-help-a-s-a-p-please/417642</link>
    <description>Ive recently started coding a rsps again and forgot how to do most things.

i was wondering if some1 would help me out and ill pay RSGP for the help.

My Problems:

Duel Arena : When You challenge some1 you can only see what you wear and Fun Weapons on the side. Also When you Win a fight you have to teleport out of there or relog to claim your stakes.

Skill : Fishing Wont let you fish in any fishing spots. Smithing D/C&#39;s You when you smith something.
this is what happens When i do Fletching.
