    <title>Started C++ RS2 server 2 days ago</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/started-c-rs2-server-2-days-ago/231059</link>
    <description>Anyways I started from scratch a rs2 server in c++

Since my C++ skill is very low.. but whatever... It ran good now I got a compile error I can&#39;t solve!

looking for people to help me out... i ran into a problem I can&#39;t solve something with not being able to find PlayerHandler

at first I was pointer happy and started making everything pointers now im doing stuff on stack and its giving me problems.. i want it exactly like winterlove server only in C++

so anyone who got any experience i&#39;ll attach the project here
hoping someone could atleast solve my error..

Also I noticed the java Cryption had  &gt;&gt;&gt;&#39;s couldn&#39;t find those in C++ but &gt;&gt; should do the trick.
Before when it was compiling without any problems it ran really smoothly.

anyways I attached it.</description>
