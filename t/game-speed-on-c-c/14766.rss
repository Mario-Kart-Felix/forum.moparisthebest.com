    <description>Okay so I&#39;m playing Command and conquer generals:zero hour and in the skirmish menu bit it says game speed.... now.. when its at its lowest (15) it goes really slow and when its at its highest (59/--) it goes the same slow speed.. now i know for a fact that it can go faster than its snail pace because i was at this guys house and it was going like really fast. It&#39;s not my computer because ive tried it on other ones and it goes slow.. how do i get it to go faster?</description>

              <p>its not that kind of speed. its the speed in which the buildings are built and the speed they generate money, and its the same both ways. it doesnt really make a diff though.</p>
