    <title>Delta No-Clip?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-no-clip/528750</link>
    <description>So when I click on something in my server such as a thieving stall (or any object that requires you to walk to it to use it) my character walks correctly around walls and objects as he should, but whenever i choose to attack an npc or another player, my player just no-clips through everything. Is there a way to fix this problem? if there is more information i should include please tell me, i have no idea how to go about fixing this  :o</description>
