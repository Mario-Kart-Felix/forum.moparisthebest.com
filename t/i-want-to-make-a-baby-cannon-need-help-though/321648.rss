Maybe he meant model help? also…it would take about 10min’s to get the cannon resize down, if that(at least for me), after that adding the animation, I am out. I you want me to resize it, just askXD.</p>

              <p>[quote=“wolfs goal, post:2, topic:321648”]I’m pretty sure for the arrow, you need to make a custom GFX.  Also for the Re-Color, why not just use a regular cannon.  Lastly, for the cannon code that allows you to set it up, dismantle ect. You need to get that, not many servers have fully operating cannons.</p>
<p>Best of luck,<br>

              <p>I’m pretty sure for the arrow, you need to make a custom GFX.  Also for the Re-Color, why not just use a regular cannon.  Lastly, for the cannon code that allows you to set it up, dismantle ect. You need to get that, not many servers have fully operating cannons.</p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>
