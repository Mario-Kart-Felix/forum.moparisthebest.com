    <title>Running two operating systems at once, without virtual pc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-two-operating-systems-at-once-without-virtual-pc/539373</link>
    <description>I have two operating systems installed, Ubuntu and Windows 7. 

I was wondering is there a way to run both without using a virtual machine? So that I can run both operating systems together when my PC starts up and then be able to switch from one to another.

Edit: Is there a way to make use of hibernation so the two operating systems do not conflict if confliction occurs allowing them to run together?</description>

              <p>Correct, you don’t need a full blown filesystem. What you do need is a layer above it, which FUSE can do. Or y’know, write a daemon that uses OS hooks and magical pixie dust if you prefer.</p>
<p>Also, it would take 10 minutes. FUSE is easy as shit and you can get bindings in like 999 languages.</p>

<p>As vain said, you can hack something out with FTP/Dropbox. If you want something better you can easily write your own filesystem with FUSE.[/quote]<br>
It wouldn’t take 10 mins to write and I can already access the files stored on the Windows 7 through Ubuntu because the directories are visible and easy to access, so just having a shortcut in C:/ to each operating system will do the job. You do not need a file system.</p>

This is on topic, how old are you? If you are old enough, search community colleges in your area. Look for a class on “OS basics” or something along those lines. I believe inorder to boot up though your system uses hardware, and logically it chooses the operating system to start. The only say i see this being possible is if one were to boot after the other, but i have no idea how this work work, unless your computer was two different machines. The Virtual PC is the best thing i can think of that would act like this. Because it puts the information to run your system in the memory(dedicated to this). I know nothing about computer hardware, but i am interested in learning as well. Currently taking Networking and Advanced Java at my local CC. Transferring to a 4-year in the fall (: The other route of doing this would be to look up how a computer BOOTs up.<br>
But my best guess, it would be a hardware change, not software <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>
[/quote]<br>
I don’t think hardware is an issue with this. I was thinking about changing the boot loader to support running more then one operating system but that is just a theory in my head that I won’t go into detail about.</p>
<p>There was an idea about using Linux and use that as a background app to run Ubuntu and Windows 7 but I have no idea what the workload to achieve that may be (if possible). This would be still be a vitalization somewhat.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s possible. Unless, as you say, you setup some hibernation type thing to switch between them.</p>
<p>It’d definitely be possible to write your own operating systems and run them simultaneously, but Windows/Linux/Mac/etc all assume total control over the hardware and the only way to make them share is to virtualise it or run massive OS-level context switches.</p>
<p>edit: lookup hypervisors. Unfortunately it’s still virtualisation but it’s really the only way of doing it without modifying both operating systems</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t know how to setup the hibernation process or if that’s even possible. Was just something an idea I got from stackflow about memory issues that could occur.</p>
<p>I saw Hypervisors earlier on and it seemed more like VirtualBox to me. I did not understand how it would accomplish what I wanted to do. I will look into more detail later though.[/quote]It depends what type of hypervisor you’re looking at. The lightweight types (e.g., Oracle VM) run on the hardware directly and coordinate hardware access instead of providing any significant virtualisation, so it’s as fast as you’re gonna get it without rewriting the operating systems. Stuff like virtualbox is a lot slower because you’re running the hypervisor on top of an existing operating system.</p>
