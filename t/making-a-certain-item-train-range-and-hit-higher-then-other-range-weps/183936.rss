    <title>Making a certain item train range and hit higher then other range weps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-certain-item-train-range-and-hit-higher-then-other-range-weps/183936</link>
    <description>Is it possible? Because I made rune c bow an item on my server with crossbow animation,karil walk animation,verac stand animation, etc. Problem is, it trains melee whenever I shoot. 

I added my bow to the (usebow) list of item id&#39;s but then after I use the bow, it shoots like a short\long bow. I want it to train range, POSSIBLY hit higher by range bonus and not strength bonus(that&#39;s what is it set on right now) and keep the animations I set for it. 

If I have to change all of the range items so it would hit higher by range bonus, I will do it. I just want rune c bow hit 40 or so, have spec I have already set, and keep the animations I set while training range. Making it the best bow</description>
