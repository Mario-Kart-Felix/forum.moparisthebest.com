    <title>Stop Being Lazy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-being-lazy/538438</link>
    <description>There&#39;s nothing more frustrating than coming on here and seeing individuals with less than 5 posts asking for someone to do all the heavy lifting for their project. It&#39;s the same people who expect spoon feeding and want to take credit for other people&#39;s work. It&#39;s the same people who are too lazy to actually go learn something for themselves. Do you want to run something of your own? Then do the hard work. Learn to program for yourself. There are so many online resources and so much documentation that this all shouldn&#39;t be too difficult. Yet you avoid putting effort into something.

So do yourselves a favor and actually sit down and learn something. Stop requesting a piggy back. I&#39;m not claiming there&#39;s anything wrong with a development team. It&#39;s a lot of fun and the bouncing around of ideas between the team members allows the creative juices to flow just that little bit more. Everyone must be a contributor in the team though.

If you contribute nothing to the team and your main motivation is epeen then your project will most likely fail.
