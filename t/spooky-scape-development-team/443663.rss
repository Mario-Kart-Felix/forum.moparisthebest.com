    <description>[font=arial][size=10pt]Hello mopar. I have just started a new server recently and I am in need of help! I am dedicated and I want to become a successful private server! Let me start off by talking about me, I am 16 years old, I live in the US, I hold no job, and I have nothing better to do all day except to work on my private server. I am the host of my private server, I have a completely separate PC then the one I use sitting next to me that is dedicated to running the server! So expect 24 hour uptime!
Here is what I need:
[u]Coders[/u]
Web Developer (I know a professional web developer who I could have make me a site.)
Bug Testers
Loyal Players
As of now, I&#39;m using a PI base. Which I will want to change, depending on the coder(s). I got a few loyal players already, but I really need a coder. Like I said we need to improve the server, maybe change the base. Feel free to IM me on MSN at sp00ki@hotmail.com
Thanks. [/size][/font]
EDIT: I NEED a coder! I am receiving donations already and I need help fixing a lot of things before I pay for advertising and it gets popular and gets a lot of players!! HELP is needed! Anyone with desirable coding/programming skills please add me on MSN - sp00ki@hotmail.com
Thanks!!</description>
