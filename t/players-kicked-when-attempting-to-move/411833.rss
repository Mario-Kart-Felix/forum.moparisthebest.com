    <title>Players kicked when attempting to move</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/players-kicked-when-attempting-to-move/411833</link>
    <description>Hi Everyone, First post on the forum so hey!

I&#39;ve just started my first ever private server, which is going pretty well. I&#39;m using OceanX (I haven&#39;t a clue what cache version it is, but it includes vestas). Everything has gone really well up until the point where my players want to interact with other game objects. They are able to move (Walk) once, then the next time they try they are kicked. The weird thing is, I can use it just fine and can interact with anything without getting kicked. Also, if players follow me they do not get kicked. 

I was wondering if it was something to do with my Firewall/Router, but I&#39;ve turned my Windows Firewall off (Not my Antivirus) and have portforwarding working. My best guess was that it was on the clients end, but I guess I&#39;ll leave it to the experts to push me in the right way.

Oh, and sorry for the vagueness of my client, I&#39;m extremely new to this.

Thanks,

Alex</description>

<p>That’s just clarified what I thought it would be and not really given me any direction. Would any body recommend removing the ‘AntiHax’ from the server side client class? Or would that be an unwise mood? I’m thinking it may have something to do with that…[/quote]<br>
I would suggest to look into your walking method and compare it with the walking method of another source.</p>

              <p>It’s either something to do with your source or client, hence your portforwarding or firewall has nothing to do when it’s soemthing In-Game. I don’t have a clue but just look for a kicking method when they walk. It may be an antileech.</p>
