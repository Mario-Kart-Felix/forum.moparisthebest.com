    <title>What was the name of that client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-was-the-name-of-that-client/59797</link>
    <description>There was a client awhile back that was under development and was a newer client than what mopar uses. It also had a server that basically did nothing because it was so undeveloped. I think when you logged in all you got was a black screen but it was a newer client and server than what we all use. Anyone no what it was called?</description>
