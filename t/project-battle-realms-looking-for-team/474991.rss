    <title>[Project Battle Realms] Looking for Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-battle-realms-looking-for-team/474991</link>
    <description>Hello to everyone.

I am willing to start a project of Making a Runescape Private Server. Still haven&#39;t found a server name. Thinking of Battle Realms...Maybe.
It will be a 24/7 hosted server, and we are making a Team to work on the server.

Here is what we are looking for :

[ul][li]1 Website Designer ( HTML - Flash - PHP / Bulletin Forum ) - Experience Requiered.[/li]
[li]1 Experienced Coder[/li]
[li]1 GFX Designer[/li][/ul]


I can code aswell, do some GFX and i know HTML aswell. But i don&#39;t want to do all the job alone. I need help to make that server the best new RSPS  :)

The server name still can be changed once the team is formed and we can decide all together.
[b]Skype is Requiered for all...[/b]
Dropbox is required for the Coder.

Q: What kind of server i&#39;m about to make ?
A: The server will be based on a Great Player vs Monsters system, a good Skilling System, [i][b]LOW EXP[/b][/i] Rate, Making will not be super easy... just normal... Great Economy + Pk system for players that loves to Player Killing.

Q: What source are you using ?
A: I don&#39;t know yet, Still looking around.

Q: Why are you wanting to make a server ?
A: I&#39;m 22 years old, tired of all those servers that are easy as hell, 2 hours of training and having all 99 skills... I&#39;m interested to make something that will take weeks to get all 99 skills... And almost all the servers dies after 2-3 weeks... so here is why i want to start my own 24/7 Server, staying online for over 1-2 years... maybe more if everything works fine.


Here is my Skype if you are interested. DON&#39;T ADD ME if you have no experience and have no clue of what you are doing :
