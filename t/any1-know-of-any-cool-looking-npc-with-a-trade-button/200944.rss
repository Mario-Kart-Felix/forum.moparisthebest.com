    <title>Any1 know of any cool looking npc with a trade button?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any1-know-of-any-cool-looking-npc-with-a-trade-button/200944</link>
    <description>Im making some shops in my server and i need the people you trade.
The problem is, is that I want some unique shop keepers.
Not the same old general store guy!

Preferably people that would stand out,
like the slayer masters for example.

If you know of any npc that is unique and can trade,
please post them here with their ID.

Thanks, Sk8rboymike.   :)</description>
