    <description>Okay so what I was doing was going to use a new client a friend had given me...

At first I was getting an encrypted !=10 server window err after changing the m.bow to RSA modeuls and exponets, I compiled that error went away. (in stream.java)

But now I am getting another error. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;the server window keeps saying 317 whenever I try to login

the client window keeps saying blahblah has been updated. please reload your client.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

could somebody tell me where to look to fix this please.</description>
