    <description>Hi.

I started fixing up a server and i decided that if i had helpers it would become bigger and better much more faster. The server is based on a stripped base which i removed all the crap in client.java and created some handlers now the client file is only just over 300kb. Im not one for writing loads on forums so please visit
[url=http://projectunknown.ipbfree.com]here[/url] to join

The main aim of the server is to have mainly all skills working and fun to play.

You must apply to become a server/client developer before you can access some of the boards.

Thanks</description>
