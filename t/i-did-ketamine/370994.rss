    <title>I Did Ketamine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-did-ketamine/370994</link>
    <description>well, In a way.

Long story short - broke my left arm for the second time this year skateboarding. Needed immediate surgery. I&#39;ve got two 4 inch stainless steel plates in my arm with 8 pins each (I think, possibly 6).

They gave me ketamine to do the operation. It was fucked up. Before they put it in my IV, my surgeon told me to think of my favorite dream. I thought of flying, and the last fucking thing I remember was them putting that oxygen thing in my nose. I started coming down, I don&#39;t even fucking know how long I was on that shit. It was around 12 am, and I remember tripping fucking balls. I don&#39;t know if I was awake during the operation or not. I came off, and my arm felt like it weighed 80 tons. By the way, I was completely out of my fucking body. I looked at my surgeon and said sorry about 12 times. why? I couldn&#39;t fucking tell you. I started trying to talk to my dad but I still felt out of my body. I didn&#39;t get to sleep until 3 AM, and all night I asked myself &quot;Is this my life?&quot;. Felt fine the next day, ate, got let out at 8 pm. 


It was fucked up dude

Edit: First break in June of this year

<p>Yeah I was reading and apparently it’s extremely uncommon… I seriously fucked up the first time I broke it, and they did surgery asap. I don’t have a pic of the second break, but I’ll post the first, it’s fucked.</p>
