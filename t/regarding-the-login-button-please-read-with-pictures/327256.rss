    <description>Hello everyone, now today I have a 2 problems to do with the Login button. I&#39;ve removed the &quot;cancel&quot; button and centered the login button.
Problems:
1. The log in button, like the actual frame that is around the button, I can&#39;t get to be centered with the text &quot;Login&quot;
Picture:

I&#39;d like to raise the box itself to the text, here&#39;s the codes and etc. for this area:
[code]	    if(!flag) {
	    int i1 = c / 2 - 0;
	    int l1 = c1 / 2 + 50;
	    aClass30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub2_967.method361(i1 - 70, 16083, l1 + 0);
            aClass30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub4_1272.method382(0xffffff, i1, anInt939, &quot;Log in&quot;, l1 + 5, true);
		}
	}[/code]
Please reply if you can help!

2. Now for problem 2 it&#39;s a more clicking problem. When I click where the login box used to be it logs in as well as where the cancel box is (my cancel box doesn&#39;t do anything except replace the text &quot;please enter your username and password&quot; with the original runescape one &quot;enter your username &amp; password.&quot;).
Is there a way to make it that when you click the place where the login button was it does nothing and same with where the cancel button was? Also to make it log in when I click the new login button? If so please reply telling me how.

Thank you very much for reading please reply.</description>
