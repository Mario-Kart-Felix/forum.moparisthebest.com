    <title>In Need of Assistance When Someone Finds the Time!</title>

    <description>[center][b]&quot;The server ________________ is offline, it must be online before you can register it here.&quot;

I know my ports are forwarded correctly. Jdk path is correct. The client has been JAR&#39;ed and everything, but yet, it still says it&#39;s offline.

My IP has been put in as 127.0.0.1 on the client. Is that correct?

I&#39;m really confused. If somebody knows a solution to my issue, it would be greatly appreciated!

I worked on this all night and finally thought I got the hang of it. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever tried bring a RSPS to life. Everything was going so smoothly.

I&#39;m very confused.

But, anyway, yes. When someone finds the time and is able to help me, I would really appreciate it.

Thank you very much for your time![/b][/center]</description>

<p>What you set your client’s ip to has nothing to do with registering a server to a toplist website. You must double check that you put the correct ip in the registration field, and make sure you allow inbound connections to port 43594.</p>
