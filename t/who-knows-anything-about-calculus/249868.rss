    <description>Im trying to figure out when to tell if I need first derivative to tell extremas and when i need second derivatives, cause i know i need second derivatives and if the answer when its set = to zero if its negative thats a relative max and if the answer is positive then its a relative minimum but other than that im not sure what to do with extremas.</description>
