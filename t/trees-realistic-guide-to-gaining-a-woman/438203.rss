<p>Females will see you as a play toy if you don’t show masculine traits… like the ones listed in my guide. The whole thing is based around having enough self-respect to set solid boundaries and making strong opinions. It’s about being true to your desires and embracing your sexual side. I feel as though you’ve missed the point multiple times now. You’re making arguments against viewpoints that I’m not expressing.</p>
<p>For those who say that being yourself brings you quality anyway, then chances are they are already showing those masculine traits. However there’s loads who are not. They become puppy dogs. Now I support opposing opinions… however, you’re opposed to arguments that you falsely believe I’ve made. Perhaps by trying to read ‘between the lines’. I could also put it down to your religious beliefs. I consider all that brainwashing but that’s another debate entirely.</p>
<p>I appreciate your input either way, however flawed I find it.</p>

the best advice, be yourself.</p>

<p>Great advice for a man who is confident, attractive and interesting. For most of the members here, it’s absolutely useless for meeting anything other than up-tight, gold-digging bitches.</p>
<p>I’ve personally been out with Tree and seen him work his magic a couple of times - he not only knows his shit, he actually applies it. Though I don’t totally agree with all of it (like the need for a wingman - I actually prefer rolling out solo and meeting girls before I catch up with my friends these days), pretty much everything in there is spot on. Most of this stuff will work for most people. The catch here - you have to want to meet girls, and want to fuck them. If you have no sex drive, you’ll inevitably just become their little play thing.</p>

this thread is pure horse shit, enjoy your AIDS and other STD thats the only girls that give up all morals to just fuck because they know they are screwed so they might as well take the world with them.</p>
<p>Oh also can’t forget those looking to get knocked up for child support, those are real good catches too!<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If someone is stupid enough to get an STD/STI, I have no remorse for them. It’s their own stupid fault. (Just so you know, the prevalence rate of HIV/AIDs is actually pretty low outside African countries. The transfer rate isn’t even as high as you might think it is)</p>
<p>And what I’m seeing here is that, for some reason, you seem to think it’s immoral that girls have sex on a regular basis? What about the girls that can actually enjoy sex without the guilt that society in general usually places upon them? I guess you’re only upset about this 'cause you don’t get this kind of attention from men irl.</p>
<p>Just a quick protip: Guys <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">don’t</span></span> like fucked up women, just the same as women don’t like loser men, but in a lot of places (mostly Americanized countries), it becomes hard to avoid them. Btw, here’s the real, unadulturated, un-“politically adjusted” scoop: the only issues which will really cause problems for a woman in today’s society are older age and ugliness. But you can’t forget the constant reassurance that women should find their ‘perfect man’ and ignore anything less. Girls with these symptoms are usually the ones trying to scam their way into pregnancy at approx. 35+, as they feel their ova drying up. Funnily enough, men won’t actually fuck women with any of those issues anyway - which is why they’re so desperate in the first place.</p>
<p>But then again, you’re probably prepared to overlook all of this, and just label me as a “misogynistic pig.” It’s ok though, I understand that you’ve probably been told all your life that having a vagina makes you a special little princess. I don’t blame you for believing the press - they can be pretty convincing sometimes.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/whackatre">@Whackatre</a>: There’s pretty much no such thing as a ‘respectable woman’ in the western world. Feminism has pretty much destroyed the western woman’s ability to actually have a truly meaningful relationship with a man without feeling guilty about something, or disrespecting them at every level. Those women that actually show respect and care for a man usually get quickly shot down by their friends, and society in general. It gets even better, 'cause when it comes down to it, they’ll still give in to their primal urges and take the manliest dick on offer to them, then try rationalise their actions, ignoring all truth and logic in the process.[/quote]</p>
<p>sure is pretentious in here</p>
