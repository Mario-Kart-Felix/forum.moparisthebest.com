    <title>Regarding 458+ Clients/Servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/regarding-458-clients-servers/130709</link>
    <description>Ok, I have got source/clients from all arround. I have tried to work out the packets to log into the server. I got to log in but a black screen appears and i cannot basicly do nothing. So im kind of stuck at this point.

Does anyone have a source that login system doesent work yet, ill try to rework the structure and maybe it will work.</description>
