    <description>i cant do the cmd run thing where u have to put in ipconfig...it says its not a valid command. and whats the defualt browser?

and this from stormcutters tut i cant understand

First of all, go to start.  Then run then type in cmd and press ok.  Inside the black box type in ipconfig.

Now remember the default gateway!

Go into the address bar and type it in.

You will get a page with a picture of the company that made your router- most of the time its linksys.

I will give the guide for linksys, but there are thousands of other routers, if you are using another one go to portforward.com.

Note this guide that I am about to post is directly from portforward.com
Use your default gateway not the one mentioned in the guide.</description>

id say the reason you cant do start-&gt; run-&gt; ipconfig, is because if you set your environments up you made the original one called path to something else, and made a new one call path for java and ant?<br>
just a guess, it isnt the first time ive seen ppl do that</p>
