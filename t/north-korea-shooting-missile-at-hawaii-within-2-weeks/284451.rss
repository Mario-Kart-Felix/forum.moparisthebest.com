              <p>I agree with spel, the US is full of ignorant people who believe whatever their parents believed. This is a problem in politics and all forms of human interaction in, and outside, the US. Racism has been rampant in the US since the existence of it. We have fucked up our own morale system as a country that we are running parallel to the book entitled 1984. Most Americans don’t even see what’s going on, or they don’t want to see it. They will continue to live their lives in ignorant bliss, proud of all the mistakes their country made in the past.</p>
<p>Even though I live in the US, I have as many reasons to dislike and like my country as the rest of you do. Sure, Britain has had its shining moments and brave moments, but so has every other country. Each country has their glories and their mistakes. But trying to prove which country is better is completely pointless. No country is perfect, thus no country should be compared to another.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tree">@Tree</a>: my US history class which I took last 2 semesters was very unbiased. My teacher even pointed out his likes and dislikes of our dirty history with facts backing them up. I considered it a very good class, but I am only speaking for 1 school. I have personally gained a lot more respect for Britain and other countries after learning about WWI and WWII, but I can’t say the same for 90% of my classmates, nor the many other students in America that took the same class. I hope that all American students gets that same, unbiased education of US history.</p>

<p>Edit: Just read the rest of the thread. You all have good points, but… Why do you all hate the U.S.(most of you…)? You might think we’re all brainwashed retards, but to be honest, most of us are very smart… I’m not trying to stand up for the U.S.(nor do I want to), I’m just saying that we’re really not as dumb as you all seem to think.[/quote]you mean most are completely retarded while a small percentage is intelligent.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to hate usa, for instance their close-minded views on politics. In USA you’re either a democrat or a republican because that’s what people are brainwashed into voting for. The fact usa’s captalism has basically raped all natural resources and completely destroyed many countries is a damn good reason as well, look at Venezuela for example.</p>

Okay, I need a good fuck tbh.</p>
<p>When was the last time the British won a war(without the USA)?</p>
<p>When was the last time North Korea had enough balls to start a war?(besides the one with South Korea)<br>
[/quote]If it wasn’t for the British, the German airforce would have defeated the USA.  The British took out the entire German airforce, solo, then bombed Berlin…</p>
<p>l2history[/quote]</p>
<p>As far as I know, the U.S. sent over many fighter pilots to help deter the luftwaffe &gt;_&lt;</p>
<p>Edit: Just read the rest of the thread. You all have good points, but… Why do you all hate the U.S.(most of you…)? You might think we’re all brainwashed retards, but to be honest, most of us are very smart… I’m not trying to stand up for the U.S.(nor do I want to), I’m just saying that we’re really not as dumb as you all seem to think.</p>
