    <title>NEW and I need help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-and-i-need-help/550012</link>
    <description>I have been trying vigorously for 3 days to get a RSPS  that I can use locally at least. I used to not be able to get it to run at all. But I finally learned how to to portforward and select paths and on an on an on. I got my no-ip set up. RevanScape.no-ip.org and when I CTRL + F &quot;server =&quot; it takes me to the current IP. I replace it with my no-ip and then i find the other one and make sure that it is server = &quot;&quot;; then i compile on both server and client, run the server .bat file, then run the client .bat file and the game loads. I go to log in, and I get &quot;Error connecting to server.&quot;

Please someone help me!!!</description>

              <p>This is simple, OP…</p>
<p>Your issue is because you’re trying to connect to yourself… And you can’t.</p>
<p>When you are on the <span class="bbcode-b">same computer as the server</span> - Set the client IP to “localhost” or “127.0.0.1”. They do the same thing.<br>
When you are on the <span class="bbcode-b">same network as the server</span> - Set the client IP to the local IP address (The one you used to portforward in your router)<br>
When you are on a <span class="bbcode-b">different network as the server</span> - Set the client IP to either your No-IP (Assuming the No-IP DUC is running) <span class="bbcode-u">or</span> your IP address (Found at <a href="http://whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://whatismyip.com</a>)</p>
<p>No-IP is “old technology” and hardly needs to be used. The reason people used it in the past was because their IP addresses were dynamic, so if they used their normal address it would eventually change, thus rendering the client useless. However, in this day and age, hardly anyone has a dynamic IP (That doesn’t mean there aren’t people who do), so it’s not needed.</p>
