    <title>Server Help please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-help-please/29627</link>
    <description>Hi there. I&#39;ve started my own server and now want to make it into a good server before I advertise it. I&#39;ve set this server up to help my children and I&#39;ve never played MoparScape myself and know nothing about it. I&#39;m using TestScape. I don&#39;t really understand about source codes so need all the help I can get. I need it explaining in Basic english please as I&#39;m not that good with this kind of stuff. My children have logged into my server with no problems so at least I&#39;ve got that bit right.
Many thanks and I look forward to your replies  :)</description>

              <p>well basic stuff is that</p>
<p>.java files are source code files you can edit those in notepad most likely searching this forum for tutorials on what you need to your server.</p>
<p>.class files are the source code files compiled made so java.exe can read them you cant edit these files at all.</p>
<p>compile.bat if it exists that makes all .java into .class<br>
runserver.bat runs java.exe which runs .class files.</p>
