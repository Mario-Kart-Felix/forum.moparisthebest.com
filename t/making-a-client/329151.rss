    <title>Making A Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-client/329151</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to make a client for my server. I have tried finding the client that goes with me server, but I have yet to find it. I was also wondering if i could just delete the models that don&#39;t match in the server&#39;s model file and the client&#39;s model file and would it run? I know right know that it disconnects me because the models don&#39;t match. Thank you!</description>
