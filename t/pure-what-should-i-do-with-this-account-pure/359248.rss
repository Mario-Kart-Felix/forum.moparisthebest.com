<p>I guess so… but think about it. I would wanna hit more frequently because even if you had 80 str and 1 attack, you will still get pwned by sum1 with 20 att and 75 str. Reason is that you might be able to hit a good load of damage, but it will only happen once every 2-5 hits… while a guy with 20 att and 75 str will hit a good load of damage on you every 1-3 hits. So the maximum 0’s they would have on you would be 3. While you would be hitting them and the maximum amount of times you would be hitting 0s on them would be around 5+…</p>
