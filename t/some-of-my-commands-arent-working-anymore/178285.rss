    <title>Some of my commands aren&#39;t working anymore</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-of-my-commands-arent-working-anymore/178285</link>
    <description>I have a problem with some of my commands. I have hiyascape source v1 if you want to know and for some reason the ::char, ::bank, and maybe some more aren&#39;t working. They worked before but today they aren&#39;t. I wasn&#39;t messing with commands lately but does anyone know how to fix this?</description>
