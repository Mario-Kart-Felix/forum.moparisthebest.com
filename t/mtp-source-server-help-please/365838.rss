    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mtp-source-server-help-please/365838</link>
    <description> :( after a very long time of trying to make the MTP SOURCE SERVER a spawn server, i could not do it...
So i decided that i need your help so I can finish my server and everyone can play and have fun as just a pk server.
So here is what i need help with to make it, so either right as a player logs on there Membership, or Donator = 2 so they can use the donator shop i want it to auto set there donator, or membership ALSO IS THERE A WAY TO EDIT THE DONATOR SHOP TO MAKE IT SO ANY ONE CAN BUY ITEMS FROM THE DONATOR SHOP?
AND If i can&#39;t do thAT i want to put dragon claws in the pk shop, and set all the items in the pk shop to 0 pk points HOW DO I DO THAT?
IF THERE IS CODE, CAN YOU GIVE ME THE CODE PLEASE?
CAN YOU HELP FIND WHERE I FIND THE FOLDER TO CHANGE PRICES, AND WHERE TO PUT IN THE ITEM ID IF THAT IS HOW YOU DO IT =O..
I REALLY NEED HELP, THIS SERVER WOULD BE GREAT IF SOMEONE HELPED ME WITH JUST THIS PART...
SO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO HELP ME THANKS VERY MUCH.</description>

<p>Well, yes. I grasped the fact it’s up for download. I mean, what deob is it? Is it Delta, PI if so?[/quote] here is a picture, you can see your self that it is almost a 474… Although it has 317 graphix or gfx, I’ll assume the server is a PI because delta has bad gfx… click the picture to see it bigger.</p>
