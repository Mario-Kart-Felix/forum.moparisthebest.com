    <description>Vendetta


Server Name :  Vendetta
Server De-Ob : 562 or 612+

ADMINS
President -  Lewis
CEO  -  
Content Developer(s) - WorldofWar
Web Executive - Champ/Ryan
Senior Promotion Manager -  Rhaine
Hoster -  Nick

Moderators
GFX Executive - 
Junior Promotion Manager - 
Community Manager - Aaron
Player Representative - Will be decided ingame


Information on Hoster

Nick is a very good friend of mine, I&#39;ve known him for years. He has two state of 

the art computers. The Hosting computer is Quad-Core Processor with 8gb RAM. His 

internet downloads at 2-3mb/s. He is very reliable and after 3-4 weeks into the 

release of the server, we will invest in getting a Dedicated Server.



Information on Promotion

Rhaine has 4.5k Runescape related Subscribers in which he will upload a video 

about the server etc. I have many contacts with people on Youtube, such as 

tuhkur102 (1.5k Subs), Dh023 (4k Subs) and 1itemdbow (13k subs). Those people 

require small payments (apart from rhaine) in which I am willing to invest my own 

money.

Information on Owner/President

My names Lewis. I am 16, I come from Northern ireland. I have coded RSPS&#39;s for 

18-24months. I have run 3 succesful servers over the time which has made me $3,000 

 profits, but they thing that stops me from keep on going is that I had too much 

work to do and had little help. I feel that this plan of mine has a great deal of 

potential and within a few weeks we will have a massively succesful server.


Rewards

Once accepting your position, I will not lie, it will be hard work and tiresome. 

But if you are mature and responsible and work hard, you will be given a bigger 

percentage of profits. Not only will you recieve IRL money, you will be an 

official in a most likely huge community.

              <p>Vendetta</p>
<p>Server Name :  Vendetta<br>
Server De-Ob : 562 or 612+</p>
<p>ADMINS<br>
President -  Lewis<br>
CEO  -<br>
Content Developer(s) - WorldofWar<br>
Web Executive - Champ/Ryan<br>
Senior Promotion Manager -  Rhaine<br>
Hoster -  Nick</p>
<p>Moderators<br>
GFX Executive -<br>
Junior Promotion Manager -<br>
Community Manager - Aaron<br>
Player Representative - Will be decided ingame</p>
<p>Information on Hoster</p>
<p>Nick is a very good friend of mine, I’ve known him for years. He has two state of</p>
<p>the art computers. The Hosting computer is Quad-Core Processor with 8gb RAM. His</p>
<p>internet downloads at 2-3mb/s. He is very reliable and after 3-4 weeks into the</p>
<p>release of the server, we will invest in getting a Dedicated Server.</p>
<p>Information on Promotion</p>
<p>Rhaine has 4.5k Runescape related Subscribers in which he will upload a video</p>
<p>about the server etc. I have many contacts with people on Youtube, such as</p>
<p>tuhkur102 (1.5k Subs), Dh023 (4k Subs) and 1itemdbow (13k subs). Those people</p>
<p>require small payments (apart from rhaine) in which I am willing to invest my own</p>
<p>money.</p>
<p>Information on Owner/President</p>
<p>My names Lewis. I am 16, I come from Northern ireland. I have coded RSPS’s for</p>
<p>18-24months. I have run 3 succesful servers over the time which has made me $3,000</p>
<p>profits, but they thing that stops me from keep on going is that I had too much</p>
<p>work to do and had little help. I feel that this plan of mine has a great deal of</p>
<p>potential and within a few weeks we will have a massively succesful server.</p>
<p>Rewards</p>
<p>Once accepting your position, I will not lie, it will be hard work and tiresome.</p>
