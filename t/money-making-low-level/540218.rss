    <title>Money Making - Low Level</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/money-making-low-level/540218</link>
    <description>This isn&#39;t really much of a guide, but I&#39;d thought I&#39;d post this. This is a lower level method, but it can be done at any level.

So first off, you want to find a world with a lot of people at a cow pen. Once you&#39;ve found a good world, you want to start collecting the Cowhide. I&#39;d also recommend bringing some combat gear incase you want to speed up the trip. You should also bring some GP with you for the 10 GP Alkhaird gate (if you&#39;re doing the lumby cows).

As of now this is making around 7k per inventory. Which is really good for lower level players. I recently made a new OSRS account and made 40k in about an hour doing this method.

EDIT: You can also tan them for more money; however I don&#39;t recommend it as not many people buy them tanned.</description>

Most p2p methods at a low level is just collecting stuff such as Barrie’s.</p>
