    <title>Need help with my MoparServer =(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-moparserver/270153</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m just gonna give you a little background of what i did so that if i did sumthing rong, i can be sure of it. Okay, 1st i downloaded RichScape v1. Then i extracted it to another folder called &quot;Raid Skape&quot; which is the name of my server. Next, i downloaded hamachi so i could logg on to my server. Finaly, i logged into my server using moparscape. 

Okay, now that u no the background info, here&#39;s what i need help with. After i changed dialoge, items in shops, and then saved it. When i played on my server, the NPC&#39;s dialog stayed the same as befor. Even when you logg on it says &quot;welcome to richscape&quot; when i changed it to Raid Skape.

I also want to know how to change what a new player starts out with and where. Right now it&#39;s giving new accounts  a bronze sword, wooden shield, 25 minds and airs, and 30k. It&#39;s also starting players out in lumbridge. I would like to give them different items when they start out, and i want them to start out in edge.  

1 last thing that i need help with is that I don&#39;t know how to find co-ordinates on my private server, so that i can add npc&#39;s to certain areas. 

Thanks for your time and help. =)</description>
