[center]Hello, My name is Ryan and i have recently started getting back into owning/coding rsps.
I have been working on this server over the years, and now want to perfect it.
I am looking for a dedicated team to help me along the way, and to make Element grow.
As you can see from the picture above I&#39;m not the best gfx artist, so i will be needing one.
I will also need a developer both client sided and server sided to help with things.
I can make an OK website, but I&#39;m looking for a Web Developer, who knows more and who can watch over site.[/center]
