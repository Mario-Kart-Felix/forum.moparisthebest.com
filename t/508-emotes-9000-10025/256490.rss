    <description>Hey, not sure which section this belongs in, but I just spent about half an hour to an hour getting these.

Also, don&#39;t leech them please.

Here they are:

These ones were found by Carnage for [508] servers.

They stop at 10200 and 10300 I think, but doing ::emote ##### over over and over again isn&#39;t my thing.

I&#39;m gonna get the rest of them soon. Of course, I won&#39;t release if these get leeched. Also, if someone else has already done this, I will remove this. (I had a short search and couldn&#39;t find anything even like this.)

I found the Turkey emote in there from the Thanks Giving event, when [508]&#39;s were made before the Thanks Giving event???

Anyways, enjoy. ;)</description>
