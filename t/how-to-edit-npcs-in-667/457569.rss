    <title>How to edit NPC&#39;s in 667?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-edit-npcs-in-667/457569</link>
    <description>How Do I edit the npc&#39;s in 667?
Like I already spawned them in the npcspawned.java, But how do I edit their health and combat... etc?
For example, I just edited the npcspawned.java with entering count draynor as a boss,  Now how do I edit his health and what?
What file is it in or can someone help me with a tut?

Also, Where do I edit how he RE-spawns. Not spawns but respawns?

Thanks. 
I&#39;m using zenith source.</description>
