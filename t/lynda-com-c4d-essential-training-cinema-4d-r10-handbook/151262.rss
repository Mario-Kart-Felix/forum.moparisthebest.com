    <title>Lynda.com C4D Essential Training + Cinema 4D R10 Handbook</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lynda-com-c4d-essential-training-cinema-4d-r10-handbook/151262</link>
    <description>It seems more and more people are getting in to the 3D scene, so I thought that I&#39;d give you all two recommendations. 

Firstly, the Cinema 4D R10 Handbook. Great..for very beginners. It isn&#39;t for people have gone past basic modeling, and are starting to work with more complex and advanced tools. However, this book is good for lighting, basic animation, materials/textures, cloth, hair, dynamics ect. I&#39;ve gone through most of it, and wont say it was the best investment, but it&#39;s good in the last 4-5 chapters. 

Secondly, I very big recommendation to the Lynda.com Cinema 4D Essential Training by Larry Mitchell. May not exactly be worth the $100 it is, but it comes close to that value. I learnt do much for these series of in-depth, level minded tutorials. Absolutely fabulous for really starting to work well with C4D...

I know I haven&#39;t been around much lately, but I very much plan to post some stuff in the coming weeks, once I&#39;ve got this college crap sorted. 

Goodluck to everyone who I have seen working and starting with Cinema 4D.</description>
