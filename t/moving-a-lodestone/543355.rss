    <title>Moving a Lodestone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moving-a-lodestone/543355</link>
    <description>I need help moving my lodestone to the center of Varrock.

[b]Information about lodestones:[/b] Lodestones have 2 objects, the lodestone itself and then the ring that is around the lodestone.

[size=1]Image of the &quot;ring&quot; of the lodestone.[/size]

[b]What I need help with:[/b] I have managed to get the IDs of both the ring and the &quot;button looking thingy&quot;. However, the &quot;ring&quot; uses the object type 22, not the typical 10. I can&#39;t really spawn the object, even using object type 22. It never shows as visible, so this is how it looks at the moment:

(notice how the &quot;ring&quot; is not showing)

So yeah, how will I move the &quot;ring&quot;. I spawn it as object type 22, but nothing comes?

Thanks,
