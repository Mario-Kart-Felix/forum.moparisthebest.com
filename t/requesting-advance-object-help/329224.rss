or 

How can i make a blank server? (how would i create a blank server with everything but the world objects loading).[/size]


-- [size=8pt]Extra information for the noobs who care for my reason....

Yes i know how to use the deletethatobject on my server, but to delete every single thing it would take forever. I wanna re-add everything to detail, with my own custom buildings, objects, and ect.
