    <title>Mushroom that EATS PLASTIC discovered, environmental breakthrough</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mushroom-that-eats-plastic-discovered-environmental-breakthrough/439451</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;This week we&#39;re talking about fungus two ways. One that can survive exclusively on polyurethane and another that can replace Styrofoam.
Both polyurethane and styrofoam are not biodegradable, so without a solution, all the plastic bottles and old toys we throw out every year will be sitting in landfills for centuries.
Yes, you can recycle plastic, but that just means turning it into another product and recycling hasn&#39;t sufficiently slowed the production of new plastic.
According to a Yale study, globally we produced 245 million tons of plastic in 2006, compared to only 1.5 million tons in 1950.
One of the fungi we&#39;re looking at is called pestalotiopsis microspora. It was discovered by a group of Yale researchers on an expedition in Ecuador and can subsist on polyurethane alone in airless environments, like the bottom of a landfill.
The other comes from a couple of college friends who discovered that the sticky substance on the bottom of mushrooms called mycelium could be turned into a glue and when that glue is combined with corn husks and other food byproducts it takes on a form similar to Styrofoam. Their company, Ecovative wants used Styrofoam to become mulch, not waste.
A future with less plastic and more mulch, all thanks to fungus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

quote from comment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is no amazing discovery, we have had the same material for hundreds of thoudands of years already in use until it was recently banned about 50 years ago from being grown in the united states. The substance that has been banned in the united states that has the very same versitile uses of these so-called magic mushrooms is Industrial Hemp. 
Industrial hemp has been in use for centuries in the same manner and it as well could replace the use or need for oil based products.Unfortunately tho, the Dupont and Hearst Corporations bribed Congress to outlaw Industrial Hemp along with Marijuana it&#39;s sister plant because they Dupont and Hearst did not want to compete with the versitility of Industrial Hemp. Competition is great and brings prices down, eliminate competition and prices of products made from these substances raise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
