    <title>Help adding the admin crown to player rights 3(owner) in a 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-adding-the-admin-crown-to-player-rights-3-owner-in-a-562/398295</link>
    <description>Hey, I am working on a 562 atm, and as you probably know, players with rights set to 3 don&#39;t have a crown before their name in chat like in a 317. I have searched all over for what makes a chat message appear, and ive gotten it to go on the outside, after their name and before the text, but not before their name. Id like to do this server sided, using &lt;img=1&gt;. Has anyone figured out how to do this? thanks.</description>
