    <title>Read please iff your good with clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/read-please-iff-your-good-with-clients/327905</link>
    <description>Hello,

I was just wondering if somebody could explain to me how you make it so people can only connect to your server iff they have your client, so you give people a client which is the only one they can connect to your server with.

If people could advise me.

That would be very good</description>
