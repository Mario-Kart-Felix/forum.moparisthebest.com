    <title>1 BIG question I have been waiting 4 DAYS for answear</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/1-big-question-i-have-been-waiting-4-days-for-answear/188075</link>
    <description>Alright How do I get rid of nulls. Im not sure why they are there what they do or how to get rid of them. I made a command to get rid of them

[code]                   if (command.startsWith(&quot;kn&quot;))
		{
			PlayerHandler.kickNick = null;
                        sendMessage(&quot;You kicked the nulls fat holes&quot;);
                }[/code]
I get the message but It does not kick any of the nulls. I have a bad problem with nulls because around 10players I have on my server I get 28 nulls!.

Could someone post me away to get rid of nulls AND I HAVE CHECKED THE SEARCH AND TUTORIAL SECTIONS

or post me a comand to try
