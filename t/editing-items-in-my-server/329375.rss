    <title>Editing Items in my Server!?!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editing-items-in-my-server/329375</link>
    <description>[s]I need to know how to add items to my server(like skill capes) and how to edit how you wear it so it doesn&#39;t take up a weapon spot. I already have it on the client and know the ID... but when i use it on the server, i wear it and it says non existing item blah blah blah. Please give me a link to a Tut or something because I have been searching for a while and haven&#39;t found anything yet.[/s]
Got the adding the item part down... now I just need to know how to edit how you wear it? Please tell me.
P.S. I am using a Cleaned Delta source</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Go to models section and read the guide on how to upload items. or type ::add model or add model. Then try. It will grab models and add to your client. If that still doesn’t work you could try editing the cape on mesaquioa (or however you spell) and then turn into .dat file and everything. Its all in guide. Guide is by SilentCJ in Models section.</p>
