    <title>Jarred like 100 clients, And this one doesn&#39;t work? rep++</title>

    <description>Hey guys, i jarred like 100 clients and they all worked fine.

but this one i made my client webclient ready, it works fine downloading cache extracting, and then loading.

but when i jarred it, it gives the retrying in 5 4 3 2 1, retrying in 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Very strange because the client that i jarred loads fine, but after jarring it on put it on internet it gives this error? anyone knows why?

I&#39;ll give rep++ to the one who can solve it</description>
