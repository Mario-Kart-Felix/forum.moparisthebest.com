        <p>Hey, well if you know me personally, I like to customize things… make them different, better, cooler, funnier, or even just random…<br>
and with a runescape private server, it lets me use my creativity, my (somewhat) ability to code to the point where I can modify many things in a server, and totally “re-create” a game that I love(d) to play…<br>
So in knowing this, you should know where I’m coming from on this next question… I would like to modify one of my best skills in Runescape that doesnt really give you much unless you spend countless hours on this skill… the skill I’m speaking of, is nonetheless… Mining.<br>
Yes, everyone hates mining (except for me) especially in a private server, mainly because there is absolutly NO reason for Mining to take place in a private server because no one wants to buy ores, bars, coal, all that stuff in a private server when money is just a code away from their reach… so I was thinking… maybe there is a way that some of us could spice up mining in our server, give the people a reason to mine… so, I wanted to see what you all thought of my proposal…</p>
<p>What if, when you mined, instead of getting ores… you got weapons/armor/money?</p>
<p>So that’s the first question I’m going to ask you, I want you to answer that question first, then answer this next one…</p>
<p>What if we took a regular object (I was thinking a broken wall or something) and gave it a mining interface, then changed the case ID for it, so that way instead of changing a mining rock, you could mine a broken wall… or something… would that be cool?</p>
<p>I would really like it if you all replied, because I don’t want to make something no one would use (and yes I could probably make this)…<br>
but I want to know if you guys like it or not, so please give me some feedback…</p>
