    <title>I&#39;m not really asking for help, this is more of a question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-not-really-asking-for-help-this-is-more-of-a-question/226437</link>
    <description>Hey, well if you know me personally, I like to customize things... make them different, better, cooler, funnier, or even just random...
and with a runescape private server, it lets me use my creativity, my (somewhat) ability to code to the point where I can modify many things in a server, and totally &quot;re-create&quot; a game that I love(d) to play...
    So in knowing this, you should know where I&#39;m coming from on this next question... I would like to modify one of my best skills in Runescape that doesnt really give you much unless you spend countless hours on this skill... the skill I&#39;m speaking of, is nonetheless... Mining.
Yes, everyone hates mining (except for me) especially in a private server, mainly because there is absolutly NO reason for Mining to take place in a private server because no one wants to buy ores, bars, coal, all that stuff in a private server when money is just a code away from their reach... so I was thinking... maybe there is a way that some of us could spice up mining in our server, give the people a reason to mine... so, I wanted to see what you all thought of my proposal...


What if, when you mined, instead of getting ores... you got weapons/armor/money?

So that&#39;s the first question I&#39;m going to ask you, I want you to answer that question first, then answer this next one...

What if we took a regular object (I was thinking a broken wall or something) and gave it a mining interface, then changed the case ID for it, so that way instead of changing a mining rock, you could mine a broken wall... or something... would that be cool?

I would really like it if you all replied, because I don&#39;t want to make something no one would use (and yes I could probably make this)...
but I want to know if you guys like it or not, so please give me some feedback....
