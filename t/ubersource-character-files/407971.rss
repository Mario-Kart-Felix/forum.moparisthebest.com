    <title>Ubersource Character Files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ubersource-character-files/407971</link>
    <description>Hey,

Well I downloaded ubersource and I was trying to look at the player file, and I cannot seem to do that. When I go to the characters folder, the files are .dat and I can not open them... If I use notepad they come up as encrypted files, so I cannot see any information about the player. What do I do to open the player&#39;s file? Thanks.</description>
