    <title>To throw or not to throw?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/to-throw-or-not-to-throw/414022</link>
    <description>A while back at work I was working with Oracle&#39;s Data Provider for .NET and ran into a really annoying feature. Oracle, in all their wisdom, had chosen not to implement [b]Timeout[/b] for queries and even wiser had chosen not to document this. They also chose not to throw a NotImplementedException when attempting to set the Timeout. So after about 2 weeks of messing around with it I finally found out why queries I was setting to run for 30 seconds where taking 10 minutes.

Anywho, besides the point.

Assume the code below (C#):

[code]public class ConsoleServices
{

    public static int
    GetAnswer (string message, string[] possibleAnswers)
    {
        string  answer = string.Empty;

        //Change all possible answers to lower case for comparison
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; possibleAnswers.Length; i++)
            possibleAnswers[i] = possibleAnswers[i].ToLower ();


        //While user hasn&#39;t entered in a valid answer
        //Continue to ask question.
        do
        {
            Console.Clear ();
            Console.WriteLine (message);
            
            Console.Write (&quot;( &quot;);

            if (possibleAnswers.Length == 1)
            {
                Console.WriteLine (&quot;{0} )&quot;, possibleAnswers[0]);
            }
            else
            {
                for (int i = 0; i &lt; possibleAnswers.Length - 1; i++)
                {
                    Console.Write (&quot;{0}, &quot;, possibleAnswers[i]);
                }

                Console.WriteLine (&quot;{0} )&quot;, possibleAnswers[possibleAnswers.Length - 1]);
            }
            

            answer = Console.ReadLine ().ToLower ();
        } while (!possibleAnswers.Contains (answer));


        //Find and return the index which was selected.
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; possibleAnswers.Length; i++)
        {
            if (possibleAnswers[i] == answer)
                return i;
        }

        //I believe unreachable code.
        //
        //Im not sure whether to throw an exception or returns some arbitrary value,
        //I&#39;m going with throwing an exception, because if this line of code is ever
        //reached, something really weird happened and -1 doesn&#39;t really say what
        //needs to be said.
        //
        //Whats your opinion?
        throw new InvalidOperationException (&quot;Invalid Answer&quot;);

        //return -1;
    }

}[/code]

I&#39;m in a [somewhat not at all] similar predicament, where I don&#39;t know whether I want to throw an exception, or continue program execution. I believe the last line of code in the method GetAnswer is unreachable (if its not, please inform me), but assume that it is [by some freak accident], what SHOULD be done and WHY?</description>
