<p>Probably not. Unless I see a really big demand for it, I probably won’t do any more further development. The server is fully functional, and all the core components are finished. The only stuff missing is content, such as skills, events, etc… We have included very basic content, as an example of how to utilize our scripting system, which includes fishing, woodcutting, firemaking, and mining. Using those as examples, you could easily build a new skill.</p>
<p>One thing I regret not doing is making very detailed comments with examples, which could help speed up the development process for the emulator. If I had properly put in time and effort into making documents, I’m sure there would be alot more support for this project. It’s very massive and hard to develop for in the beginning, but once you figure out how things work, you’ll enjoy working with the framework.</p>

<p>I don’t think there is any additional steps to get your friends online.<br>
Possibly you would need to portforward if you have a router, and allow the port to endpoints outside your LAN via your firewall settings.</p>

<p>Indeed, but Java and C# do have similar attributes. In fact, I like C# because of it’s similarities to Java, and I have to say, I do prefer it over Java.</p>

Read my previous post properly.</p>
<p>Firstly, Jolt has been around longer than Ziotic. Jolt was first started on July 2009, and the Jolt v2 generation emulators starting in February 2011.</p>
<p>Secondly, Jolt has been using RuneScape’s 666 revision since it was released (back in September 2011), whilst the original Ziotic was made for 640. The 666 Ziotic you are talking about was released AFTER we released our Jolt v2 preview. Also to add to this, Jolt v2 preview was also released before Ziotic 640 was leaked. Explain how we are going to leach a server that we had no access to what-so-ever. If you’d like, go ask the Ziotic team (laz,maxi), they’ll even tell, Jolt is completely different from Ziotic.</p>
<p>Thirdly, <span class="bbcode-b">Java and C# are NOT the same thing, and anything who says so are complete and utter retards</span>. Sure, they share similar syntax, but where do you think Java got their syntax from? They got it from C/C++. I know C/C++, C#, and Java very well, and I can tell you each one of these languages are very different from each other, except for their similar syntax. They have similar syntax so it’s easier to migrate between languages without getting confused about their syntax and conventions.</p>
<p>I am going to assume that you don’t know either Java nor C# because of these retarded statements you are trying to persuade. I could go on for days about you’re arguments are invalid, but this is wasting my time.<br>

<p>You have no idea how programming works do you, I have to say your are by far the most ignorant little punk i have ever met, C# and java are two entirely different things, Even if he did leech “which he didn’t” do you have any idea how much would have to be changed to get java code to C#, really… Before you come into this thread acting like a hotshot, research your shit a little more. Because you are just making yourself sound even more retarded every passing minuet!</p>
