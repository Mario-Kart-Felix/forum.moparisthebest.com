    <title>Can we please keep the 10 years out of mitb?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-we-please-keep-the-10-years-out-of-mitb/270188</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sick of seeing this gay threads stating: TO MAKE HOMEWORK FUN, LETS DO IT LIME GREEN PAPER!!! BUT MAKE SURE TO ASK YOUR TEACHER FIRST!!! CUZ THEN YOU MIGHT GET IN TROUBLE!!! OMG WE DON&#39;T WANT THAT.

They are obviously huge gay-pussies and can&#39;t even spell the word &#39;cause&#39; right nor type.

How do we get rid of them?

When you register, it should say

&quot;We are friends with C.O.I.S (Children on the Internet Safety) and we will report if you &#39;fake&#39; your age online. That is considered fraud and you could go to jail for that.&quot;

Some fake statement to piss their pants.</description>

It’s not so much an age problem as a maturity problem, there are quite a few 13 year olds on here that are far more mature than some of the 18 year olds.<br>

<p>The quiz wasn’t intended to test intelligence, it was intended to test independent work ethics. Basically, it was created so that people <span class="bbcode-i">do</span> use google to look up answers to their questions. This eliminates all excuses for those who can’t find their answer on the forum, see?</p>

It’s not so much an age problem as a maturity problem, there are quite a few 13 year olds on here that are far more mature than some of the 18 year olds.<br>

<p>That is a good question. We ought to find out: Someone from here who knows what they’re doing should get someone who doesn’t to try and join the site; and monitor how they manage the quiz. Or something like that - people who evidently should be failing aren’t, and we should know why.</p>

<p>But someone should make a new and better, where you have to think and not just guess the answer or google it.<br>
Some sort of IQ test would be good, you have to get over 100 in IQ or you get banned.</p>
