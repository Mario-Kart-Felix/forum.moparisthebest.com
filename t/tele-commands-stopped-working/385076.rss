              <p>You most likely didn’t place your new commands at the right place in your source…<br>
Maybe you also forgot to close a bracket<br>
For instance if you open 3 you should close them all 3 when you’re done. Example;<br>
Code1 {<br>
code 2{<br>
code 3{<br>
code 5<br>
}<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<p>That avoids having one big chunk of useless writing</p>
