    <title>FULL pickpocketing!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/full-pickpocketing/340144</link>
    <description>I just finished FULL pickpocketing. It uses every NPC that runescape has(if they&#39;re in 317, that is). It&#39;s actually VERY simple. I have one void and then one function with a bunch of parameters. It also lets me specify up to three items to give to the player, and the player has a one in four chance of receiving those items--a different chance for each different item. It also lets me specify the QUANTITY to give to the player. I even have it base the chance of failure based off of the player&#39;s level, and a &quot;maxlevel&quot; variable that defines when the player will stop failing.
