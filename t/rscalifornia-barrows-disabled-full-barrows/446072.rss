Barrows. It is FULLY ADDED!! FULLY!!

When you dig into the ground and then try to search the tomb for the veracs or whereever you dug its supposed to pop up, and attack you, thats how barrows works. but thats my problem when you try to get the Veracs/all of the barrows guys to pop up and attack you it doesn&#39;t work.

it says &quot;Nothing interesting happens&quot;

How can i fix this?</description>
