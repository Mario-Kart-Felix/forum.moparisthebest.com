    <title>Most Disgusting Food Ever Ate!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/most-disgusting-food-ever-ate/526479</link>
    <description>There is this channel on Youtube I go to a fair bit to watch their shows and they show themselves eating a bunch of weird stuff a lot of times and many times puking afterwards. 

They recently posted on their twitter asking for more ideas/getting feedback on what the worst food you ever ate before. Figured this might be an interesting topic to compare with people all over the world. 

So I ask you Mopar, what is the worst food you have ever eaten? How would you rate it? 1 being ... omg freaking gross * vomit * to 5 being... pretty good actually would eat again!. 

Drinks can be posted instead of food as well.

Myself... I ate about a ten year old can of Popeye spinach once...yeah it  was sick... I give it a definite ONE.</description>

The soda was completely flat, so it was basically watery flavored syrup and IT IS 20 YEARS OLD. That is 20 years of plastic being released from the contained into 20 year old clear syrup. We have no idea of the conditions that soda has been put through. For all we know it could have been put outside in the sun or left in a garage for 20 years in sweltering heat and then refrozen every winter. Odds are it wasn’t kept at room temperature for an entire 20 years, so it is not suprising that his stomach was unable to digest it and forced him to expel it back up again.<br>

I think urine part was just humor. Nobody would risk pissing in a Pepsi bottle and get sued for ill humor and false advertisement. I think the thing was supposed to be a collectible, not be an idiot and drink it.</p>

I could eat it. There’s not a food I dislike so much that I won’t eat it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I’ve never had tuna, so I can’t compare. I can’t say I’ve ever tasted anything else like it, so I can’t really explain what it tastes like.</p>
