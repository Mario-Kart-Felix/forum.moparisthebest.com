    <title>Savage Realms (Something For Everyone)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/savage-realms-something-for-everyone/451676</link>
    <description>Savage Realms is a server that has literally something for everyone, how so you may ask well.  Savage Realms actually has 4 servers in total. Pretty cool right, here are the different servers.  Main: More of a build world, but still has PVP, quests, and other fun things. RPG: Is more of a Questing world with more quests then main, but still has PVP.  Raid: This is a fully PVP server with no quests.  And last but not least Savage Games: Savage games is a hunger games like server but Savage realms style.  Are you interested in the server.  :confused: If you still have questions or want to know more about it go to the link below.

I really hope you come see this server because when I first started it was the greatest server I have ever played on (and I have played on a lot) because it had everything I loved in a server and more, so please come check this server out it will be worth your time I promise.  :D</description>
