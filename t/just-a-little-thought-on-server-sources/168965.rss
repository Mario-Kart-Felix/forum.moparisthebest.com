    <title>Just a little thought on Server Sources</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-a-little-thought-on-server-sources/168965</link>
    <description>So if im correct which I beleive I am, a server source is what makes a server looks the way it does when you log in. 

I know people make these Server Souces like:
Project Czar

The reason I use Project Czar as an example is because i see it is being used on a lot of servers.
I am not sure if it is being &quot;LEECHED&quot; or if it is for everyone to use 

The thing that gets me dissappointed is why people would use that sourse when they could make their own.
Having 1-2 of the same source on server doesn&#39;t bother me, but when people pose like: Project soul (Made up name) it gets kind of annoying. 
I know creating a SERVER SOURCE takes loads of time but it could be worth it, you never know...

Just so you all know, I am not totally against using the same Server Souce. There are some positives about using the same source and one of them that is most common is probably when a server goes down and that is the only server with that type of look then you might get a little mad, but then you would have another Server to take its place.

I just thought you all might like to know that I am in the middle on the subject I am not on one whole side.

I Would like to hear your thought on this subject:

Please Choose any opinion you like

The more opinions we get the more interesting this subject can get!

Thank You for reading, I look forward to you posts!
