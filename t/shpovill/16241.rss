    <description>I have made my own server called shpovill, shpovill2 etc. ends with shpovill5

pass is shpo

It&#39;s not the best right now but I&#39;m constantly working and learning so get a spot while you can!

I know this doesn&#39;t belong here but i made a tutorial on how to make and join servers at www.freewebs.com/shpovill[br][size=1]Posted at: September 25, 2006, 04:41:39 PM[/size][hr]Info:

My server is on around 3pm-9pm on weekdays. Varies on weekends. I live in Nebraska so the time might be different where you live.

Commands:

::kalph            tellies you to kalphite zone
::noclip (you can walk through walls)
::tar
::gotobarrows          tar and barrows are mixed up
::barrows                    all barrows
::range             range armor
::melee            dragon armor
::mage             magic armor
::empty            empties your inventory
::gopk              tellies you to wilderness
::cw                tellies you to cw (you can play it to, if you score u get a christmas cracker)
::mypos            shows your position
::players          how many players are online
::bank             opens your bank
::yell ......            after yell put what you want to say
::fly                lets you hover
::tele ####,####            in the #### put a cordinate to tele there
::cannon         gives you a cannon as a weapon

you can do ice barrage by clicking on the empty slot next to friends list
you can do most normal magic spell without runes to get ure mage up

so far i got monsters in varrock center, real barrows area, tzhaar, near the 3 cages in varrock (with a Tztok Jad),  skeletons and guards in varrock castle, mage arena (do the last ancient mage tele and then noclip to get there), and 2 men in the varrock punching bag place that&#39;ll kill you in 1 hit.

hope you like my server</description>
