    <description>Has anybody actually replicated the drops and drop rates yet? I&#39;ve got shops replicated prettymuch, npclocs and item locs replicated as best i know probably need to do more rsc research however that will have to be done over time, or user feedback.

Just wondering if anybodys done this part yet and are willing to share as everybody knows this is the most tedious, long winded part of the development.

Regards
