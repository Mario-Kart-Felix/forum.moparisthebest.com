Uprima is on the way, scientists say.Uprima is the brand for the drug apomorphine, a fresh type of anti-impotence drug, studies CBS News Health Correspondent Dr. Lizeth Senay.

It&#39;s harvest time on May well Sinkule&#39;s farm in Hillsborough, Colorado, where cotton once was king. But not this coming year. &quot;This crop should be leg high or far better, it should be totally white-colored with these bolls,&quot; Sinkule stated as he looked lower at his withered harvest.In fact, this is the worst type of he&#39;s seen in more than 35 years and his worries are without end. &quot;What&#39;s gonna come about next year? How can we put in another crop?In . Sinkule said. CBS Information Correspondent Cynthia Bowers reports that he&#39;s not alone. In the report released Wednesday, the Agriculture Department says bad weather offers cost cotton producers in this country one-quarter of their crop. In the drought-stricken South, it&#39;s much more than that - as much as 40 %.And here in your Southwest, it&#39;s not just 100 % cotton, it&#39;s corn, rice and hay. John Sulak, a farmer pertaining to four years, has come for the gut-wrenching decision to get out as he still can.&quot;You&#39;ve tried out so hard to put your lifestyle into something like this and you have no control over whether you can afford to make it happen,&quot;Corn crops damaged through recent weather he explained.

By a quarter-of-a-penny, by half-a-penny, by a whole penny. Simply by three pennies. It is simply going up almost on a regular basis,&quot; according to boater Ann Kiers.As a result, the bottom line for a lot of, is shorter fishing boat trips.&quot;Boat traffic may be off as much as 20%,Inch said Steve Reoch, dockmaster on the Sealine Marina.It&#39;s not only higher priced to power a spead boat these days, but it cost more for water bottled water. At the Snow Chicken Bottling Plant in Nj, President Dianne Drey said acrylic is a big part of the h2o business.&quot;We have a plastic material bottle, a plastic-type cap, [plastic shipping crates],&quot; said Drey. &quot;And because of oil prices going up, the cost of these components has drastically escalated.&quot;About ten percent, according to Drey.
