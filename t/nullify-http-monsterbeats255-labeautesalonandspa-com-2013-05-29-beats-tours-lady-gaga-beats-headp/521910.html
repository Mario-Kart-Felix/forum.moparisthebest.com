        <p>CBS News Correspondent Byron Pitts is traveling with U.Ersus. Marines in East Baghdad. In parts of Baghdad the energy vacuum and mayhem are a boon to many civilians. People are both celebrating and looting.“Freedom! FFREEEEDOM, Sure!” yelled an old Iraqi man.Tuesday, around the bombed and broken roadways of East Baghdad, ‘freedom’ supposed free. Free Televisions, VCRs, computers and air conditioning. There was even a bashful shopper with an armful of stolen AK47s. If a person, woman or kid could carry it, it turned out theirs. “No Saddam! Yes, Plant!” chanted others.These are the people who lived beneath the thumb of Saddam Hussein for decades. For them, it was not looting – it was liberty. Lifetimes pleasures that once belonged exclusively to Saddam’s Baath Party, right now belongs to themOne man spat as well as stomped on an Iraqi dinar which bore Saddam’s face – bitterness that was followed up times later with a warm good bye for an U . s . journalist.U.S. Marines stood back again and watched. As one said, “We did not arrive this far for you to arrest looters.” His or her mission was deal with, control and when necessary, kill Iraqi soldiers along with Saddam’s Fedayeen. And blocks in which civilians were looting your Marines found lots of both.There was an Iraqi fighting hole, three feet deep, eight toes long – room enough for two to three Iraqi military to stand and combat. But it appeared nearly all took the better alternative: run and survive.American troops today control a Fedayeen instruction camp. There are miles after acres of abandoned bunkers, items - signs of guys that lived off loaf of bread, water and tobacco.“As you can see, their military services gear isn’t that wonderful,” Marine Capt. Geebet Grodack said. “Plastic. All it is, is a plastic lining. What can it end? Nothing.” So, as families and also civilians taste the actual spoils of independence, there are also grim reminders freedom has never been totally free.  <a href="http://www.vlekrecords.com/guccibags.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">gucci bags</a><br>
Uprima is on the way, scientists say.Uprima is the brand for the drug apomorphine, a fresh type of anti-impotence drug, studies CBS News Health Correspondent Dr. Lizeth Senay.

The atmosphere around the Rock, Colo. courthouse is busy, reports CBS News Correspondent Manuel Gallegus. The nation’s media are camped-out.

It’s harvest time on May well Sinkule’s farm in Hillsborough, Colorado, where cotton once was king. But not this coming year. “This crop should be leg high or far better, it should be totally white-colored with these bolls,” Sinkule stated as he looked lower at his withered harvest.In fact, this is the worst type of he’s seen in more than 35 years and his worries are without end. "What’s gonna come about next year? How can we put in another crop?In . Sinkule said. CBS Information Correspondent Cynthia Bowers reports that he’s not alone. In the report released Wednesday, the Agriculture Department says bad weather offers cost cotton producers in this country one-quarter of their crop. In the drought-stricken South, it’s much more than that - as much as 40 %.And here in your Southwest, it’s not just 100 % cotton, it’s corn, rice and hay. John Sulak, a farmer pertaining to four years, has come for the gut-wrenching decision to get out as he still can."You’ve tried out so hard to put your lifestyle into something like this and you have no control over whether you can afford to make it happen,"Corn crops damaged through recent weather he explained. Experts liken what’s happening here to the Dust Bowl era of the Fantastic Depression but say this time Texas will not likely suffer so much because it’s not so dependent on farming.For the farmer, it is a different story.

Petroleum products everywhere on land and off, increasingly becoming more expensive these days, reviews CBS News Writer Anthony Mason.For example, about the Miami waterfront where one boat proprietor just spent $360 in order to fill 'er up, the price tag on fuel is changing so quickly, some marinas have quit posting it.“They go up half-a-penny. By a quarter-of-a-penny, by half-a-penny, by a whole penny. Simply by three pennies. It is simply going up almost on a regular basis,” according to boater Ann Kiers.As a result, the bottom line for a lot of, is shorter fishing boat trips."Boat traffic may be off as much as 20%,Inch said Steve Reoch, dockmaster on the Sealine Marina.It’s not only higher priced to power a spead boat these days, but it cost more for water bottled water. At the Snow Chicken Bottling Plant in Nj, President Dianne Drey said acrylic is a big part of the h2o business.“We have a plastic material bottle, a plastic-type cap, [plastic shipping crates],” said Drey. "And because of oil prices going up, the cost of these components has drastically escalated."About ten percent, according to Drey. And she or he said the cost of delivering a bottle of water has gone up simply by about 30%."So far, we’ve been absorbing the cost increases ourselves and wanting there’ll be an end,Inches said Drey. "But I don’t know whenever that end is on its way. And I don’t know just how long we can hold out."So growing prices for fuel are fueling inflation pressures for a variety of businesses. And some analysts tend to be warning that, should you be expecting the prices dropping back down to around money a gallon, you could be waiting for quite a while.Acrylic analyst Bruce Yanni of CIBC Oppenheimer is convinced even if OPEC increases gas production, demand is so strong, "that prices are going to stay propped up at the very least for the next two to three years."And rising oil costs could churn way up some choppy ocean for the economy.  <a href="http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/ralphlaurenoutlet.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.prevoir-labelvie.com/ralphlaurenoutlet.html</a></p>
