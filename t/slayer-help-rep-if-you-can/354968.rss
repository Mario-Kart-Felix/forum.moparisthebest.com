    <title>Slayer Help = REP++ IF YOU CAN!</title>

    <description>Okay... on slayer on my server for some reason the only monster you can kill for experience is a Skeleton (when you get a task) I have set all the other monsters (dust devils, Abyssal demons, Dark Beasts etc) as higher tasks but for some reason when a player recieves that task they get no experience and no kill count from slayer. as in if they were set 40 dust devils, they kill 1 and then they still have to kill 40. Any help? If you can&#39;t then can i increase the exp gained?
