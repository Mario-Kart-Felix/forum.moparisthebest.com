My server is not online for money. I have ran multiple servers, and I have scammed people for money, I have duped on servers, sold items for a quick buck on my own server. However, I&#39;m not the same person that I was two years ago. I have solved all my person quarries with everyone in my past and I have really enjoyed that transformation.
My server is online because of the learning experience it provides for me and it gives people the chance to be part of a family. We have people who are alone, socially unaccepted, sad, happy, people who like sports, nerds, people who hack others for a living, people who work for charity, etc.. Anyone, no matter what their background or past may involve, can enjoy something at the end of the day. Something special. That is what Abyss is.
