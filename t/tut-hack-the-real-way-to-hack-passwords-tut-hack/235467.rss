    <description>i am not responsible for any unlawful behaviour, this tutorial is written for testing and security purposes ONLY. Leaving me completely clear  ;D.

I hate going online and looking at the same page after page of &quot;send me ur username and pass&quot; or &quot;send me this code: &lt;?@user&amp;/pass etc&quot; bullshit.

Im waivering even putting this tutorial on here mainly because of the noobs, so i wont go into detail, so the pro&#39;s will understand what im saying.

Lets begin shall we, my fingers are hurting.

When your online and you see on your email, &quot;tick to remember&quot;, it saves as a cookie onto your machine.
Now, how about if you cannot get that persons cookie folder mainly because of time &amp; effort, also going on any website without concequences.
( i wont link because of lazy noobs )

1. Download an IP scanner
2. Download a Port scanner
3.(optional) Download a packet sniffer
    -here comes detail-
3. sign into MSN and use your packet sniffer to pick up your victims IP (people who didnt download sniffer go to next step), just simply open a converstation wtih them, and the packet should arrive, if not then say something to them. Not sure if its changed since i last done this.

4.phew okay! You have your IP of the victim and guessing he has by default clicked the remember button, Use your port scanner to search for an open port on his computer, if he is a noob or something he might think he is too good for firewalls and turn them off, so you can capture a port.
Its reccommended that you have port &quot;80&quot;, &quot;8080&quot; because they usually work, but try all the open ones.

5. Now if your lucky enough to get to this stage then things are looking good, Assuming we are using IE6 or we know what im talking about if u have a higher version.
Go to Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Connections(tab)&gt;LAN Settings&gt;Check &quot;use a proxy server for your LAN&quot;.

6. Nearly there guys. Fill in the IP and port number with your victims information and cross your fingers. Now click OK and try surfing the web, if you can surf the web then you have access into his machine, if not then try another one of your ports. Now assuming this has worked and you can surf webpages, go to his hotmail and check if he is already logged in, because you are using his cookies from his server. if he isnt already logged into any other site then just look for another tutorial that will allow you to tamper with his documents etc or whatever.

&lt;7&gt; if this doesnt work for you and you have no idea what to do then, try reading into it some more because my fingers are bleeding and im done for the day.

Thanks for reading, (noobs i know you have closed the page because there isnt any code here to leech!) 

If you have no time to actually go through with this, then try out this one i *cough&quot; found:
IP: 222.73.17.198
Port: 80</description>

              <p>This ‘tut’ assumes 3 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can get the IP of someone from MSN by opening a window. (This is wrong, you can only get it if you send them a file and they accept, and you don’t need a packet sniffer, just ‘netstat -na’ in a console)</li>
<li>That they have an open http proxy server, not just an open port, on their computer. (This is almost never the case, ever…)</li>
<li>That an open proxy server allows you to use their cookies. (This is 100% never the case ever, impossible)</li>
</ol>
<p>Since this ‘tut’ is 100% wrong in every way, I’m going to close it.  Don’t post stupid things unless they have a remote chance of working.</p>
