    <description>First, I realize that some of these things I am having problems with might be client sided and im posting in server sided section of the forums.


BASE/SOURCE) PI, RuneVerfix

PROBLEM 1) Ancient curses are added to my client, but not to the server. How can I add them server sided?

PROBLEM 2) None of the prayers light up when you click them on the client. How can I fix this?

PROBLEM 3) When I spawn a chaotic maul it is a null, but in the item.cfg chaotic maul is added with and item id and stats.. So how would I add the models to make it not a null?

PROBLEM 4) The item royal shit&quot; has the same models as royal leggings. How do I change the models for the shirt?

Please soon feed me, that seems to be the best way for me to learn.. when someone breaks down the basics I can understand more.
And I have looked for the fixes to my problems, so posting &quot;use the search button&quot; doesnt help at all.</description>
