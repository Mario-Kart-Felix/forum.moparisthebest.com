    <description>Hey its PKboy and im going to share with you my newly released Lunar Scape Client + Source! I have already created 2 City Updates and 2 Npc Updates availble on the website! Im very sorry I have no time for pics and vids if you want pics and vids go to www.thelunars.webs.com or soon www.thelunars.tk (when i have time lol)! To download it go to the website and go to the DOWNLOADS page and select either DOWNLOAD LUNARSCAPE OFFLINE VERSION or LUNARSCAPE ONLINE VERSION! The offline version is to play the story mode by yourself and its still really fun! Online is with every1! Oh and some people download the online version and it wont go online for some reason for them so sorry im still trying to fix it! Oh and you have my permission as the owner to take my server + client and host it on your own! But the name has to stay Lunar Scape or a law suit will be filed in the court of law! have fun!  :eek:   :) :D  LUNARSCAPE! ARE YOU LUNAR?</description>
