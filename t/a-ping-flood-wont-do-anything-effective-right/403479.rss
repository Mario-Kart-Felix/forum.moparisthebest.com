    <title>A ping flood won&#39;t do anything effective right?</title>

    <description>I was talking to this kid because he said he can get peoples xbox live accounts banned.
He said he uses a ping flood on terminal to spam their ip on xbox and get them banned.
A ping flood wouldn&#39;t do that right?
Maybe a ddos but wouldnt that be able to be traced and get him in trouble?</description>

              <p>Why in the world would any type of attack on your personal IP get you banned from Xbox Live?  It wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Would a ping flood have a significant effect on your internet connection (ie, slow down your internet)?  Possibly, if they have a MUCH faster connection than you, and your router is configured to respond to all of them, but most likely not (and for goodness sakes configure your router not to respond to pings).</p>

              <p>What do you not understand?<br>
A no life kid gets peoples ip addresses over xbox and then floods them to get them banned from xbox live.<br>
And I’m asking if this is even possible.<br>
I know you can get an ip from xbox live but I know that isn’t their real ip address and flooding it would have no effect. Am I right? That’s all I wanted to know, and if ping flood even does anything.</p>
