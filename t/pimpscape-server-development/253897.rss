    <title>Pimpscape server development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pimpscape-server-development/253897</link>
    <description>Hello, and welcome.

Recently my other server development failed terribly, therefore i started a project (on my own), using pimpscape as a base, it has 16 Handlers, including server, graphics handler etc, their is only one character saving folder, client.java is 229KB (this will be continued down to 100kb max).

I am going to package this server, the client has already been created using the 317 deob.

Server Features (soon to be added)
{
          All skills
          Correct projectiles
          Minigames
          Prayer
          anything a 317 has
}

Client features (nearly finished)
{
          Models (100% only skillcapes + hoods)
          Tabs open with F1, F2, Esc, Etc.
          added a new frame sorta thingy ( i do not know what to call it )
          multi icon
          skulls
}

Here are a few picture for now:

p....s.... this will only be a 317 server no more, no less.</description>
