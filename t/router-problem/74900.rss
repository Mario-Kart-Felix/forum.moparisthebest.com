    <title>Router problem!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/router-problem/74900</link>
    <description>I followed every direction on Mod Taharok&#39;s Ultimate Server Guide, but then I ran into this problem. I already knew how to get on my router&#39;s address, but when I clicked on the advanced tab there was no gaming button for me to create a new rule!

Just to be sure DSL Modem is the same as a router correct?


[i]Now we will need to make the rule for your router, by doing this you need to go into your router. You can do this by going into Internet Explorer (or whatever client you use for the Internet), and then type in the IP address of the router. Now log into the router and go into &quot;advanced&quot; (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the &quot;gaming&quot; button (is only left side for me...) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information:

Name: 1
IP address: 2
TCP Ports to open: 43594
UDP Ports to open:
Inbound Filter: Allow All
Schedule: Always


KEY
1 = Any name you want the server to be (I.E.MyScape).[/glow]
2 = The IP adddress of your COMPUTER; not the Internet.
Then save it. Ok now you can save settings after the rule is saved. Every router is different.  Check with the manuals for yours to fully understand how to open the ports. If you cannot find/have a manuel, go to this address:

Port Forwarding[/i]

So can someone help me![br][size=1]Posted on: April 05, 2007, 10:22:31 AM[/size][hr]---Anyone?---</description>
