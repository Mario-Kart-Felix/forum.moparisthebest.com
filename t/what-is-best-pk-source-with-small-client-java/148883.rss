    <title>What is best PK source? (With small client.java)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-best-pk-source-with-small-client-java/148883</link>
    <description>Please suggest me some sources, and please tell how many MB client.java there are, because I want JUST PK server, because bigger client.java cause laggs :[

Pimpscape? Its have 890MB client.java! Plus they put some off-PK stuffs in it, and emote/teleing aren&#39;t working.
Fr33sc4p3? Its not PK server, and with 8 ppl, its lagging.
P-16? I really hate it, Idk why, Its doesn&#39;t looks normal source, with different emoticon tabs.

Thank you! :)</description>

              <p>blitzpk has good combat infact it is based on that i still think pimpscape is the best because all you have to do is get rid of all the useless stuff make some handlers for object cases send frames and stuff like that and you probably could get it down to 500kb and pimpscape is not 890mb i have a iso/game that is that big</p>

<p>I’m not sure if anyone can suggest you a source because it’s based upon opinion some people maybe want a PK server that you can PK anywhere others only in the wild, some people may want different things than you, the best suggestion would be for you to go look at them in the download section and pick one yourself based upon what you’re looking for in a source, good luck with the new server you’re trying to get going, if you need a coder or someone to help you code/monitor the server PM me.</p>

<p>hes right. your best bet is to go to the downloads section or tut section or somthing, and download a random server, check it out, and mess around with it…</p>
<p>oh and, no client.java is small… they all have at least 25000 lines 75000 + words</p>
