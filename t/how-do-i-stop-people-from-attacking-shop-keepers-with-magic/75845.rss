              <p>If anything you would make the Shop Keepers’ have low HP.  The faster they die the better, the more you attack them the more errors you get etc.</p>
<p>This is possible, if Jagex can do it, you can do it.  It would be tough though, you’d have to get ideas from the tutorial section.  Probably not worth the time.   <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
