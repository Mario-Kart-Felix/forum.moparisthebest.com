    <title>Which would YOU play?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-would-you-play/548795</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve been working on a unique concept recently and I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s TOO different to the point where people won&#39;t play it.

I just want your HONEST opinion on which concept you would rather play as this will be an expensive and time consuming project and I want it done properly. :)

You do make a good point Elrick about the PvP too, we’ll see how the poll finishes off.</p>
<p>Keep the votes &amp; responses coming in guys, your feedback so far has been excellent![/quote]Yes, it would limit your community to a bunch of pkers (who tend to be trolls for the most part). If you could incorporate a way to be forcing PvM as well as PvP, then you’d have a different story.</p>

              <p>The issue with the 3 isles concept is… Well population.<br>
Too little player = Boring, no one to talk to… etc. Because if there’s like 2 people on and they’re not on the same isle… Yeah.<br>
Too many players = Not playable. Chaotic… How many people do you think can fit on those islands… Not very many. Plus you’re adding objects/etc for all the skills… So there’s already less space…</p>
