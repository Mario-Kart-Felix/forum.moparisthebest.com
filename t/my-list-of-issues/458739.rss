    <title>My list of issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-list-of-issues/458739</link>
    <description>Okay, so while they&#39;re not giant issues, they kinda inhibit my gameplay experience. I recently dl&#39;d the Zenithscape ps, and it runs smoothly, except for when I watch in commands, sometimes it&#39;ll say missing packet 85 or 93. Is there a way I can fix this? I&#39;m completely new to Java, so if I have to go in depth or something, could I get step by step instructions.
Second, I can&#39;t access anything in- game. When I try to go to a bank, it says &quot;nothing interesting happens&quot; the same with all shops. Can someone help me?</description>

<p>If you’re new to java, i would suggest getting a new source, a more basic one for someone is new.</p>
