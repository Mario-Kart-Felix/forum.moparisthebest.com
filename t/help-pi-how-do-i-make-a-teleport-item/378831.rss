    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-pi-how-do-i-make-a-teleport-item/378831</link>
    <description>To start off with, Im running a PI source.
Basically what i want is, i want to make a item, and when you click it it teleports me somewhere, Like a teleport tab but not make the item dissappear after i use it once.

I know firstclicknpc Exists, and firstclickobject but in my files it doesnt have any item like that or i would use that as a template but i dont even know if firstclickitem even exists.
If you would like to help me by posting a code, that would be greatly appreciated.

And can you please specify what file i need to put that into.

The item code is 3062
And when i click it it should teleport me to
