    <description>Hi,

How are you? Well, I haven&#39;t been on this forum for a day or two. I&#39;ve been really busy with school. I wouldn&#39;t have came on today, but I need your guys help, my fellow graphic fanatics. I have a lot of homework to still do, and am obviously not good with Photoshop otherwise I would be doing this myself, wouldn&#39;t I? I am doing a PowerPoint project on the book [u]Left Behind[/u], and needed these pictures to be changed. Sorry if I posted this in the wrong section, I posted it here because I thought this is where it most likely would be seen. This project is due tomorrow, so I need the pictures to be changed by today. Thanks to anyone who attempts to help or does help.

Images/Pictures:

[img]http://i11.ebayimg.com/03/c/00/c0/6a/0b_8.JPG[/img]

I need the 1st picture to only have the background without the text or dvd symbol at the bottom right corner. On the second picture it needs to have the background which is the big orange moon or whatever it is, and the text that is on there. I don&#39;t want it to show the white circle or the text on the red line.

Thanks,
Leader</description>
