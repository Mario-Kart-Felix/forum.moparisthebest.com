    <description>I was just wondering, if I buy a game at for example Gamestop or any other shop for that matter, can I activate it on steam?

Consider that the game is also available in the Steam store of course.</description>

              <p>Only some of them though.  For example, I got a retail copy of Lost Planet with a video card I bought, and after installing it manually with the DVD I activated it on steam and now I can install it through steam on any other computer I have steam on, just like CSS which I bought through steam.  However, Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, which I bought in a store and you can also buy through steam, will not let me do the same thing, so I can only install it via the DVD.  (fine with me though, I just play it in linux anyway)</p>

<p>Nah, not all games.</p>
<p>E.g CoD4 costs 49.99 euro (455 Norwegian Kroner) on Steam , but I have seen it for 299 Norwegian Kroner in a shop at the mall near me.</p>
