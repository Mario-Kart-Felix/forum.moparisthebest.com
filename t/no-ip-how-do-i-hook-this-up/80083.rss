    <title>No-Ip...How do I hook this up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-ip-how-do-i-hook-this-up/80083</link>
    <description>Alright, my server has had hamachi since the begining, (1 week ago but whos counting) Many people are having trouble or don&#39;t feel like downloading hamachi, don&#39;t blame them. I have followed the tutorial for hosting with No-ip, I have my own no-ip address (enrit.no-ip.org) I have DUC and I clicked the checkbox and port is forwarded..So now I&#39;m thinking ok everything is all good right? NOT no1 can get on it, using enrit.no-ip.org and I was told to register with serverstatus place with it, that didn&#39;t work it just said it was offline when I was running server compiler. Can somebody please, please help?[br][size=1]Posted on: April 14, 2007, 03:01:00 PM[/size][hr]any1?</description>
