    <description>[center][u]Age of Mythology.[/u][/center]

This game is amazing.  It&#39;s really old, I think the original was released in 2002, and then the expansion pack (Age of Mythology:The Titans) was released in 2004 or 2005.  There are lots of videos of this game on YouTube, so check it out if you wanna.

It&#39;s a strategy game, and the creators of Age of Empire made it.  I wouldn&#39;t like to call it a true strategy game, since the biggest strategy whilst fighting the computer or other players is upgrade and attack.  You can give units different formations to move around in-making their attack/defence more effective, although there isn&#39;t much point since normal formations are just as good.

It has great online and the campaign is simply brilliant.  If you wanna buy it, then I suggest you should.  Take my word for it.  It&#39;s cheap anyway, since it&#39;s old.
