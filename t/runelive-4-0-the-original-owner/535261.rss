Hi, so today I&#39;m announcing publicly that a close friend of mine &amp; I are working on RuneLive V4.0, I&#39;m aware that their are fakes claiming their &#39;Afflicti0n&#39; or Myself, personally I don&#39;t care, all their doing is tarnishing my works name.

So what makes us different from other RSPS? we&#39;re implementing Data Toggling between 474 &amp; 602 Data (Anims/GFX/Items &amp; NPCs),

Here&#39;s a quick screenshot of ingame:

[img]http://puu.sh/59LJ7.jpg[/img]

What content are we planning to implement?


[ol][li]Site integration[/li]
[li]Clan Wars[/li]
[li]Godwars[/li]
[li]Unique Bosses[/li]
[li]All skills minus Summoning &amp; Dungeoneering (Yes we&#39;re currently working on Construction)[/li]
[li]Quest&#39;s, Including a quest for the Lunar &amp; Ancient magicks.[/li]
[li]PvP World (World 2, World 3 being development world)[/li]
[li]all 474 interfaces[/li]
[li]Working membership system[/li]
[li]PvM changing items, I.E Unholy books allow 15% damage to Saradomin&#39;s boss[/li][/ol]


I&#39;m no good on writing project threads, so I understand some of the features I&#39;ve noted aren&#39;t really worth noting.

We will be looking for Alpha Players, to test our content pre-release, although please bare in mind alot of content will be disabled for F2P players on initial release, such as GWD.</description>

<p>I’m Dave the Creator &amp; Programmer, that was Afflicti0n, the domain names that RuneLive was originally hosted on (<a href="http://euroscape-pk.com" rel="nofollow noopener">euroscape-pk.com</a> &amp; <a href="http://e-rsps.com" rel="nofollow noopener">e-rsps.com</a>) were owned by Afflicti0n, he’s lithuanian, I’m British, he was arrested for dealing drugs, I however aren’t Arrested <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> all Afflicti0n was there for was to buy Sponsor here and on Rune-Server, I’ve learned from my mistakes &amp; yes he did RAT our player base when we had 2,000 Players &amp; Luckily the PayPal people donated to was under my name &amp; E-Mail, so I refunded all transactions the month he did this, he did this with a member that goes around called ‘P R 0 D I G Y’ I’m not sure if he’s still around.</p>
<p>I have the balls to post this, because I’m innocent, I spent years getting RuneLive to where it was when it all fell apart, I want to get it back there, hence why I’m being Honest.</p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to point out that if I did infect them, why would I have posted on our forums 2 days after I found out he did it, with a complete removal guide <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Today, I’ve finished off the entity based combat, re-did all the badly done teleporting in PI it’s now handled in 3 different classes (the spells such as Air Strike is handled in the Modern class, barrages Ancients Class, Vengeance in Lunar class) instead of having all the spells spread across 8 classes, perfected bork spawning minions after each 25% of his health has been taken away (and will spawn other minions instead of deleted the previously spawned ones like last time) occasionaly he might gain back 25% of his health if you do not kill his minions in under 2 minutes per each wave, when Bork is dead, you will have 5 minutes to kill his minions before forced out of the arena he’s a D&amp;D (Distractions and Diversions once a day) I’ve started on Lost City &amp; MM</p>
<p>The current quests we plan to have added before the release are:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Monkey Madness[/li]<br>
[li]Lost City[/li]<br>
[li]Lunar Diplomacy[/li]<br>
[li]Legends Quest[/li]<br>
[li]Heroes Quest[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>shops have been fixed up so they match our eco, meaning Bob will sell crafting uncut gems upto diamond stocking 100 at a time, 0 Ores &amp; Bars so people can’t buy their smithing from one shop (however can sell their ores/bars for profit), unlimited bronze axes/pickaxes and 10 Rune Axes/Pickaxes.</p>
<p>[ftp][/ftp]The potion &amp; food shop in Warriors Guild will sell you cooked fish upto monk fish and normal Attack, Strenght &amp; Defence potions, armour shops will have armour upto Adamant in it, Weapon store will have upto Rune however it will only stock 10 Rune Scimitars &amp; Two handed swords, the dragon armour will be obtained through drops, Dragon Weapons (apart from posoined weapons &amp; axe) will be purchased from Lost City shop (stocking 5 at a time), Monkey Madness scimmy shop (selling all scimitars only 5 Dragon Scimmys), Heroe’s Quest shop will selling 5 maces &amp; battle-axes aswell.</p>
<p>after brain storming some ideas, we’re adding a drop to any NPC over level 300 (excluding Jad) to drop a Treasure Map, this Map can be used on a chest on the Lunar Isles to give you two random items (Rune/Dragon weapons or Rune/Dragon armour + one uncut Dragon Stone).</p>

<p>Thanks for the support <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Side-note:</p>
<p>So today I was working on the server some more and the current systems have been implemented today:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Double experience week-ends[/li]<br>
[li]F2P GWD week-ends[/li]<br>
[li]Hiscores[/li]<br>
[li]Membership now loads from site[/li]<br>
[li]Bork spawning NPC’s, drop rates set.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>What’s the point of this?</p>
<p>I felt as if I was pressuring people that they will need to buy member’s to access certain content in the Server, I.E to PvM some of the main bosses, so Mod Natsu &amp; I were talking about a member’s only world instead of a PvP World, meaning you’d only be able to access Godwars Dungeon in World 1 if the week-end is active.</p>
<p>We also had another idea of the GWD being Member’s only during the week-ends, allowing all players to access GWD 5 days a week &amp; members 7 days a week.</p>
<p>I’ve also finished the boss ‘Bork’ which drop the “Fabled weapons of sin” (Chaotic Longsword, Rapier &amp; Maul) however they’re not called Chaotics &amp; they are disabled in PvP untill you pay the fee of 2,000,000GP for them to be repaired, bork will also drop the powerful range weapon known as the Hand Cannon, his minion he spawns will 100% drop 10 Hand Cannon shots, another exclusive drop is the Amulet of Ranging.</p>

              <p>I know Battle-Scape has this from 377 to 725 (or 718, don’t remember how high but it’s 700 something) (the data toggle) and it changes the models and what not - found it to be a pretty useful tool for those who don’t like 508+ or something.</p>
<p>Good luck with the development.</p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Barely anything has been done server sided, we’re mostly working on client for now, we’ve changed how combat is handled, fix dupes and that’s about it.</p>

<p>Thanks for your support AFAIK we’re okay for that we’re not a big fan of following tutorials <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Hi, so today I’m announcing publicly that a close friend of mine &amp; I are working on RuneLive V4.0, I’m aware that their are fakes claiming their ‘Afflicti0n’ or Myself, personally I don’t care, all their doing is tarnishing my works name.</p>
<p>So what makes us different from other RSPS? we’re implementing Data Toggling between 474 &amp; 602 Data (Anims/GFX/Items &amp; NPCs),</p>
<p>Here’s a quick screenshot of ingame:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/59LJ7.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>What content are we planning to implement?</p>
<p>[ol][li]Site integration[/li]<br>
[li]Clan Wars[/li]<br>
[li]Godwars[/li]<br>
[li]Unique Bosses[/li]<br>
[li]All skills minus Summoning &amp; Dungeoneering (Yes we’re currently working on Construction)[/li]<br>
[li]Quest’s, Including a quest for the Lunar &amp; Ancient magicks.[/li]<br>
[li]PvP World (World 2, World 3 being development world)[/li]<br>
[li]all 474 interfaces[/li]<br>
[li]Working membership system[/li]<br>
[li]PvM changing items, I.E Unholy books allow 15% damage to Saradomin’s boss[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>I’m no good on writing project threads, so I understand some of the features I’ve noted aren’t really worth noting.</p>
<p>We will be looking for Alpha Players, to test our content pre-release, although please bare in mind alot of content will be disabled for F2P players on initial release, such as GWD.</p>
