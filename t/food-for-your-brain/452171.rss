These Olympic medal counts do not include the 1906 Intercalated Games which are no longer recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as official Games. The IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes unofficial tables only per single Games. This table was thus compiled by adding up single entries from ...</p>

<p>2,500+ total medals. If we went by population density: India, China and Russia would be <span class="hashtag">#1</span>. USA only has 300 million as opposed to China’s billion.</p>
<p>Plus Americans pay more attention to Summer Olympics so obviously our Winter Olympics aren’t going to be AS great.</p>

You must just live with it, it would be more confusing if I did the opposite, and even more if I did both at the same time.</p>
<p>I found some data for America that shows how unpopular you are: <a href="http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2012_country_ratings/2012_bbc_country%20rating%20final%20080512.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2012_country_ratings/2012_bbc_country%20rating%20final%20080512.pdf</a><br>
(See, even more confusing, so be happy that I don’t do that).</p>
<p>So this conclude that America is not one of the popular kids, and you are not the nerdy gang of DPRK, Pakistan and Iran. So America is pretty average popular. So why claim that people hate US for being popular?</p>

<p>However you are right that the usd is the standard of currency and that we compare our currency with the usd currency because it’s a strong one. And to be honnest I don’t see anything else taking it’s place on that spot. The euro had a chance but there’s a small possibility that the euro won’t exist within a few years (Crisis in Spain).<br>
However If the USA starts another chain of economic crisises in the few years than I can see the yuan taking over that number one spot.</p>
<p>This is just speculation we can never be sure what’s going to happen.<br>
Also I only had a few economic lessons, I’m no expert, just giving my opinion on these matters.</p>

              <p>In my eyes there’s no such thing as the “greatest country” in the end every country has it’s problems sure some are better then others for example I live in belgium and we have social insurance for “everyone” and the average man/woman has wealthy income but our goverment is broke. We didn’t have a goverment for 541 days but it didn’t affect the people at all why? Because Belgium doesn’t rely alot on our goverment like some other countries.</p>
<p>Also saying that countries are dependent of the USA is total bullshit it’s true that we trade alot with the USA but if the USA would close it’s export and import we would start making more agreements with Asia and that’s already happening anyway.</p>
<p>My only problem with the USA is their ignorance. Thinking you’re the greatest will most likely be your downfall, History repeats itself.</p>

<p>The only reason we even need to trade other countries is because we tax businesses so high that they leave.</p>
<p>Now to stop all this which country is better bull shit, no country is better then another. They all have problems some larger then others, but you cannot just look at the problems you have to also look at all the good things the country offers. But then still you cannot judge which country is better unless you have lived in every single one. But then still you cannot judge which country is better, because you will always be biased.</p>

<p>EDIT I: While Canadian-US trade is very equal when it comes to the import/export ratio, US import most stuff from China and doesn’t export that much to them.</p>
<p>EDIT II: “List of countries by external debt” isn’t what you should be looking at.</p>
