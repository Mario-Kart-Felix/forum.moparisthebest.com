    <description>Hey guys, ILS here and I have a question to ask you. I&#39;m not gunna lie, I&#39;m a n00b at coding. But cut me some slack please, because I&#39;m only 13 and just got into coding a few weeks ago. I can do the simple things. Like making commands, adding global objects, simple teleports, just the n00b stuff. I want to know more. I want to be like most of the pros up here, being able to write a whole god dang script off the top of their head while they&#39;re at work or watching tv. I know you don&#39;t want to here my whole life story, but here I go: If anybody knows any beginners guide to understanding coding, A link would be very helpful. I looked on google for how to code Runescape Private Servers, but random tutorials of random things just kept coming up. Please don&#39;t flame me because I didn&#39;t know where to put this... (By the way: my server that I&#39;m working on is Project Insanity and that was the first kind of coding I ever done so that&#39;s what I&#39;m used to)</description>
