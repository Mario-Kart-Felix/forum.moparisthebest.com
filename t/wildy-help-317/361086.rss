    <description>Would any one be able to help me with making it so in Wildy you lose all your items and the person that killed you gets all of your stuff you were carrying...

And if any one could maybe help me with the issue of duel arena...like making it so you dont have to be wearing armor in duel arena to actually fight? 

Thanks
