    <title>Shard revolution rollbacks after autostart( how to set savetimer)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shard-revolution-rollbacks-after-autostart-how-to-set-savetimer/385300</link>
    <description>Hello there,
I started hosting shard some time ago,
and a few problems apeared.
I am using creativescape and I want to change the save timer, At this moment the server restarts every hour, and when you login after the restart then your acc has some rollback,
(ussually around 10 seconds) I really want to get rid of that rollbacks.
How can I update the save timer so that it saves the game every 1/4 of a second.?</description>
