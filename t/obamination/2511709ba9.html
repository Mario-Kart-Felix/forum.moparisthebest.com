<p>Most ‘lazy’ poor people, are most likely people that grew up getting givin everything, and then lost it all. They have no idea how to get it back. Its not a matter of them choosing to be lazy, its a matter of them not knowing how to do anything but nothing.</p>

Education does not give you automatic a good job.<br>
And some people are born smarter than other, of course all must work to do it good in school, but some can just read a text once and do it good in a test, and other reads in hour and still don’t do it any good on the test.</p>

        <p>I agree, but the chance of getting a good job increases drastically.</p>
<p>Some people are born ‘stupid’, yes. But many who have a job that you’d think a retard wouldn’t do, didn’t do jackshit when they were young. They thought it was cool to fuck over the teachers, or not going to school at all. Those fuckheads don’t deserve to whine.</p>
<p>Then there is a group that really is stupid. But there are jobs for people that are stupid. And if they have the will, they can even start their own company in the branch they work in.</p>

<p>I’m one of those kids that respects his parents for paying for his education. I’m one of those kids who thinks about his future, and not just about today.</p>
<p>So tell me, how do you plan on having a wealthy life in a country where you need a certificate to start a business, without an education?[/quote]<br>
I need to attend a class for 5 days and pass the exams to get a cerificate for starting a business.<br>
So that’s no problem.<br>
I think more about my future than you do. In fact, i think too much about my future.<br>
If you like studying what is given you to study, do what you’re told to do, and when you graduate work on whatever is told to you to work on, then thats fine.Go ahead and live a brainless life.</p>
<p>employees are the sheep. Employers are the shepherds.<br>
I dont want to live my life like a sheep.</p>
<p>Now that’s just my opinion, most will disagree, but thats just my view of life.</p>

        <p>In the Netherlands we use the following system:<br>
income                       tax<br>
1 	€ 0 - € 17.579 	        33,60%<br>

3 	to € 53.860 	        42,00%<br>
4 	more then € 53.860 	52,00%</p>
<p>So someone who earns 120.000 pays the following<br>
33.60% of € 17.579<br>
41,85% of € 31.589<br>
42% of € 53.860<br>
52% of € 16.972</p>
<p>I bet you Swedes pay more taxes then us. And we already pay a shitload.</p>
<p>Edit: Ske, if my plans come true, I’ll become a CEO. You need an education for that, no matter what you say.<br>
Edit 2: I chose my own education, I doubt that is something a brainless person would do.</p>
