<p>Do you know how people become poor? Exactly, by being fucking retard lazy asses thinking they are cool doing nothing when they grow up. I’m sorry for the tone, but poor people should shut up whining. They beg for food, but in the same time they smoke like a furnace and drink beer like Russians drink Vodka.</p>

People have problems, people that smoke like a furnace have a problem.<br>
In 2005-2006 there was 	12,5% poor people in US (I think there is more now), And not all of them are poor because of Drugs and smokes. Even people that have work can be poor.</p>
<p>I hope you don’t mean that poor people just should fix their own problem, if so I will laugh at you if you got some problems.</p>

</aside>
<p>owning guns shouldnt be a right, its ridiculous. What are you going to do with a gun other than shoot people? and the people can do everything they could before except go on a rampage and kill citizens. People(at least in most countries) are intelligent enough to find ways of getting rid of a government should they need do. Explosives spring to mind. Anyway owning a gun should barely pass as a privellage and should be outlawed with the exception of air rifles.</p>

        <p>Presidents aren’t elected color-wise, nor what they were trained to do(although of course they must have some basics such as law school) but for what they will do. Even though he lies and isn’t Biblically correct, he is authority, and like all presidents before him, should be listened to within a reasonable amount. I; as a Christian, listen to him because the Bible tells me to, and I like the idea of no wars for a 4-year period. Please do not judge me or make crude remarks for what I’ve said.

The right to own guns is the only right that protects our other rights.  Look at all of the oppressive governments of the past, nazi germany, communist russia and china.  The first thing all of them do when they get into power is take guns out of the hands of the people.  Because after that is done they have full power and the people can do nothing.<br>

owning guns shouldnt be a right, its ridiculous. What are you going to do with a gun other than shoot people? and the people can do everything they could before except go on a rampage and kill citizens. People(at least in most countries) are intelligent enough to find ways of getting rid of a government should they need do. Explosives spring to mind. Anyway owning a gun should barely pass as a privellage and should be outlawed with the exception of air rifles.[/quote]</p>

<p>Everything you have said by the way is wrong, in the over 30 states with a concealed carry law (meaning law abiding citizens can carry a concealed handgun) crime drops big time.  In the states like Illinois that try to ban handguns, crime is the highest its ever been.  When you outlaw guns, only outlaws have guns.  It’s not a play on words, it’s the truth.  You ban guns and honestly expect criminals, who by definition break laws for a living, to turn them in?  Are you insane?  Obama is.</p>

        <p>I don’t want him to get assassinated, i know no one has talked about it yet but it will come up.</p>
<p>If he gets assassinated, people will warship him and he will go down famous.</p>
<p>If he survives the full term and screws up the country, he will be hated.</p>
<p>Also, i cant believe how many times i have to say this, McCain would have one if Obama was white.</p>
<p>Black people who have NEVER voted before in there lives went and voted, some even did fraud. Notice how when the debates were not over and the poles opened, many many people had already voted. Now they must be happy…</p>
<p>Just on the news before the election, a black woman was asked “Why would you want Obama to be president” She said “Because it makes me feel better that an African American is representing our country.”</p>
<p>Don’t call us racist for hating a president that coincidentally is black. We could call you racist for not even listining to the white mans views and votin fo yo homie.</p>

What with helping criminals that have problems, help them to get a job, get them a new life as a taxpayer.<br>
And try to make it harder for outlaws to get guns. In many european countrys there is much better gun laws (Avoid wrong people get guns), and the crime rate is lower.</p>

In the UK (population c. 60.5m) there were 765 reported incidents of murder for 2005-6 (Home Office, undated) - a rate of about 1.1 per 100,000.</p>
<p>In the US (population c. 298.5m) there were an estimated 16,137 homicides in 2004 (FBI, 2006a) - a rate of about 5.4 per 100,000. Of these, 10,654 were carried out with guns (FBI, 2006b).[quote]<br>
we have no guns and we manage fine. Besides you can hunt with an air rifle. The use of guns has two options as far as i see it: make them illegal or compulsory that way the playing field is even regardless. The fact that anyone can just go and get a gun in america? thats just fucking retarded. Someone who is cilinicly insane but not yet proven to be so could go and buy a gun and murder x amount of people, what fun that is for the government</p>

Do you know how people become poor? Exactly, by being fucking retard lazy asses thinking they are cool doing nothing when they grow up.<br>

<p>because clearly being poor is a choice…</p>

<p>Like I said, give an example where being poor isn’t your own fault. And keep in mind, I’m talking about western countries only. Obviously Africans didn’t do it themselves.</p>

<p>Yeah because there are no areas of poverty in the western world. “Ghettos”, for lack of a better word - just full of lazy niggers, is that right?</p>
<p>Nobody becomes poor because of mental issues. Nobody becomes poor because of the environment they were born into. Nobody becomes poor for any reason other than lazyness.</p>
<p>Just like nobody with an education is stupid?</p>

People with smart and rich parents have much bigger chance to get rich than people with poor parents.<br>
Things can happen Frell after the child is born that can make them poor.</p>
