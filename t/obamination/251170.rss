    <description>Barak Obama sucks. There are so many bastards wandering around in that disgusting swamp called Washington these days, it seems mean to pick just one out, but this Obama guy sinks below the crowd. Compared to George Bush, the semi-retarded son of an oil-tycoon, trained to be a professional shit shoveller, Obama is the fucking anti-christ. He lies with such style and grace and freedom and he&#39;s so fluid and charming, he seems to pluck the bullshit out of thin air, just like it&#39;s real truth! Fuck him and fuck the government. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Obama has ridden to power on the same social currents that radicals have relied on to propel their organizing and outreach over the past eight years: disgust with the excesses of empire, longing for more fairness and sociability in daily life, optimism about vague alternatives. It is no coincidence that the liberal anti-war movement died out just as the presidential campaigns got underway; the race effectively subsumed the energy of all not explicitly critical of representative democracy. This cooptation of popular momentum is as essential to the disempowerment of the populace as the brutal repression associated with the right wing. The powers that be are equally willing to tear gas us or hire us to go door to door registering voters—whatever it takes to keep us from building our own power outside and against their structures. In that regard, Obama’s election marks a new phase of their efforts to keep their system viable—calculated to defuse discontent, further marginalize radicals, and maintain the essential power imbalances of our society while giving the institutions that perpetuate them a makeover.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Why are Americans always looking for a government conspiracy? Lol, everything is a lie isn’t it. Just like <span class="bbcode-b">Aliens</span>. Your governemt isn’t telling you anything about them and all you ever do is beg them for information and accuse them of things they know nothing about, but yet they wont give you any information. Well want to know why?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">BECAUSE ALIENS DON’T FUCKING EXIST!</span></p>
<p>Face it. There is nothing wrong with Obama. Everything the government will do, will only be done with good meanings for your country. Learn to live with it.<br>

1 	€ 0 - € 17.579 	        33,60%<br>

I need to attend a class for 5 days and pass the exams to get a cerificate for starting a business.<br>
So that’s no problem.<br>
I think more about my future than you do. In fact, i think too much about my future.<br>
If you like studying what is given you to study, do what you’re told to do, and when you graduate work on whatever is told to you to work on, then thats fine.Go ahead and live a brainless life.</p>

I dont want to live my life like a sheep.</p>
<p>Now that’s just my opinion, most will disagree, but thats just my view of life.</p>
