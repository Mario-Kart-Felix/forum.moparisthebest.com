    <description>So ever since i saw the movies &quot;I an number 4&quot; &quot;battle:LA&quot; and &quot;red riding hood&quot;
i think these movies were boring ass hell. i&#39;ll tell you why.
--&quot;i am number 4&quot; sucked because no real dangers except for maybe like 5 dudes running around with weaponry they don&#39;t know how to use.Cliffhanger was gay. And really the dudes could have been easily been taken out with a single sniper rifle.oh yeah and The ONLY funny part was when the mutated dog battled against the monstar that could glide.Not exciting at all
---&quot;battle LA&quot; sucked because its basically everything you would expect to see in every movie.happy ending(aliens retreat)Some sad parts(pablos dad dies)  And for some reason they zoomed in on everything except the damn aliens like really?When they were disecting the alien they kept shaking the damn camera like omg stay still for a sec and let me see tha alienz. Didn&#39;t like it
-----&quot;red riding hood&quot; Crappy twisted ending. Though some guy would turn into a vampire for some reason(get it?)Uhm nothing different from the book. OH yeah and many random people die for no reason at all.

all in all  i say the new movies are turning out to be very crappy and boring

               so what do you think?</description>

<p>I didn’t watch that movie because I know that is how it will be like in 2012, people loosing their minds or something. Plus the fact that I’ve seen one too many movies as similar as that movie.</p>
