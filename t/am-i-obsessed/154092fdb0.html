<p>So, in your opinion make a few more poverty stricken countries gay and suddenly they all become healthy and have enough food? Poverty stricken families may be short on education but by reducing the amount of children they have (which is already reducing because of AIDS) it’s not magically going to iron out all of their problems. In my opinion the climate pays a role but most importantly its the government who should of looked after their country in the first place, although the government now obviously are not to blame because they were not their when England explored and took third world countries items, modified them and sold it back to them. Along with other countries who played certain countries for fools.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, I’m saying population increase is not something we need right now.  And yes, with less people dividing up a set amount of food, each person woul have more to eat.  Simple arithmetic.  And less children means less people carrying AIDS.  Which is a good thing.  And nice digression at the end of this paragraph.</p>

<p>And thats the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.  It shows that you’re completely bs-ing, and you have no clue what economics is.  Debt isn’t bad for a country.  Greenspan was apprehensive about the countries’ surplus before Bush took office, and the war, though plunging us into debt, was not as bad as you may think.  The point is, debt isn’t bad.  Also, do you think if a country rebelled, they’d still be alive?  There would always be someone getting the short end of the stick, there is no way we would trade fairly in any circumstance.  Again shows your ignorance to the world.</p>

<p>By all means i feel sorry and would grab at any chance to help these poverty stricken families because it is not their fault they are in this situation (apart from not using contraception). Of course it was unfair that other countries such as England and America took these less educated and developed countries and basically took the piss out of them just for their own benifit. But hey thats nature, be the best, be the biggest and be the strongest/richest.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Nice tangent… No one asked about the poverty stricken families, we’re talking about gays.  England and America are actually helping the poor countries out.  Ever hear of the World Bank?  Probably not.  And no, nature’s goal in normal competition is to produce the most offspring.  Now that we are the dominant species of the earth, we should be curbing nature’s goal for ourselves, not succumbing to it, because it will only lead to disaster.  We’re not rabbits, though some people may be just as intellectually gifted as one.</p>

</aside>
<p>How is it far from being pampered?  Ask a starving child in Darfur whether he thinks your life is pampered, then say it’s far from it.  Man-kind is currently thriving.  We are the best species, it’s not like we’re competing with groundhogs or anything.  There is no reason for us to deplete natural resources, cut down whole forests, or suck the Colorado River dry.  We’re killing the earth.  It’s not going to happen in your lifetime, but eventually the ecosystem would collapse.  And if you say you don’t care, it would invalidate anything you’ve said about the betterment of mankind, because it shows you simply don’t care about it.</p>

<p>I’m not saying everyone should be gay, so you should rethink your argument.  I’m saying gay people are not hurting the human race.  Without Einstein or Edison, I’m sure we would still have electricity, considering they had electricity before they were born.  Electricty and most discoveries were the result of many different researchers.  Without one of them, someone would have simply taken their place.</p>

        <p>okay first of all:</p>
<blockquote>Without einstein or thomas edisons parents in theory we wouldn't have electricity as early as we did.</blockquote> incase you didn't realise i said that "as early as we did" not " we wouldn't have electricity". And there are more points such as "we are talking about gays not Africans" well maybe you should stop trying to out smart me with the most obscene and tanganted ideas possible.
<p>and all i have to say to end this argument is:</p>
<p>gays didn’t give the human race anything apart from a wet rectum and a girls throw.</p>
<p>without further ado, i give you:</p>
<p>The END of this discussion/argument.</p>
<p>Fine by me if you wish to carry on aimlessly trying to convince yourself that gays have “helped saved the Earth”, the more posts you reply to the more you try to convince yourself that gays are for the good.</p>
<p>Lets face it, if being gay was so great, wouldn’t everyone be one?</p>
<p>during the victorian times homosexuals were seen as vile pests who deserved no place in society. Fine if people want to be gay and have a gay wedding. But don’t try to make out that being gay is so superior.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you call my life pampered i very much doubt you aren’t pampered or are a famished person from a third world country.</p>
<p>By all means try and get the last word on this but by carrying on we are not only pointlessly trying to convince each other different things that arn’t going to work because my opinion far differs from yours. But you can believe what you want and i will believe what i want.</p>
<p>Sure, carrying on believeing that gays are good but lets face it without male and females we wouldn’t be here. And we obviously havn’t evolved far enough to allow men to have babies by concieving from their anus. Lets just let the woman do what they do best:</p>
<p>-Give Birth.</p>
<p>Sure its your opinion and if certain males find males attractive then why not. But lets just say i don’t agree with homosexuality, when you obviously do.</p>
<p>If homosexuality was okay, then there would be no need for woman.<br>
By being gay i believe you are trying to turn nature into something it is not.<br>
Fine you might get one elephant that likes its male companion but lets face it, the large majority know the way of life, and its through a female.</p>
<p>That is all i have to say on the matter, and of course people will agree with you and people will agree with me, at the end of the day if you want to be gay its up to you, but the large majority don’t as you can see as nature is our evidence.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>

        <p>First of all, if you didn’t realize, we had electricity before Einstein and Edison, so their births had nothing to do with us having electricity at whatever time period.</p>
<p>Second, I never said gays helped save the Earth, or that they are right or that we should be gays.  Try to read what is said instead of what your biased mind thinks I’m saying.</p>
<p>Third, you said gays were being selfish.  And as I pointed out to you, gays aren’t being selfish.</p>
<p>Fourth, in the Victorian times, intelligent design, literal from the Bible, was the prevalent belief.  Does that mean they’re right?</p>
<p>Fifth.  I never said gays were superior, next time, maybe learn to pick a fight with someone who can’t remember their last post.</p>
<p>Sixth, I never said I wasn’t pampered. But I recognize it and admit it, while you disagree.  I at least realize that just because everything seems fine from our perspective, it doesn’t mean the humanity and the world is fine.</p>
<p>Seventh, you’re simply a biased, close-minded person.  Of course I won’t get through to you.</p>
<p>Eighth, keep arguing a different debate.  This is about gays being selfish, not about whether we should all be gay.</p>
<p>Ninth, if homo’s don’t bother you, why the hell do you care so much?</p>
<p>Tenth, nature created homosexuality.  Is that evidence for you?</p>
<p>And finally, if I realized you were this sophomoric, I wouldn’t have argued with you in the first place.</p>
