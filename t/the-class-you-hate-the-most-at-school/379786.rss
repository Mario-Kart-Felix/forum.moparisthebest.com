[/quote]</p>
<p>um wow if that ever happened to me i sure wouldnt put up with it. that reason she gave about not giving sophomores an A is so fail, if that was the only reason to not get an A in that class i would take it up with someone above her, and that not liking the way they write their d’s i would be the same way(taking it to a higher power). if not even the school board will do anything about it, then go to the state government, crap like that cant be taken lightly.[/quote]<br>
People complain, but they don’t complain to the right people. If she does stuff like that to me though, I’m going to ask her how do I fix it, and then if she doesn’t tell me/acknowledge me trying to correct whatever bullshit thing she doesn’t like, then I’ll just go and complain to the right people. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>about the college it depends where u go. my college i go from 8am to 2pm and only have 3 classes. i cant skip any classes(well i can but u can only miss 10 classes b4 they start taking 1% of ur final grade and after a certain amount of days u will be asked to withdraw from the college unless u have a legit excuse to mess class like that. depending on where u go and how ur instructor is, u can skip their entire class and just take the tests and quizzes and pass the course).</p>
<p>if im tardy(even arriving to class the minute, class is to start) u get 1% knocked of ur final grade in the class. the attendance thing at my college is like that to help us understand the importance of being on time, and to knew that employers dont tolerate bad attendance in the work place. our grading scale is different also but that doesnt matter.</p>

              <p>School bores me. I personally can’t wait till college. Sleep 2-3 periods a day out of my 5, yet I have no problem keeping up with grades. Taking on a challenge this year as a Sophomore. Took Chemistry Honors, and the teacher that teaches it doesn’t give A’s to Sophomores. She says that Chemistry is a Junior only class and that no Sophomore deserves an A. I’ve seen people get pissed off because she didn’t like the way they wrote their letter “d”. She counted as if the letter didn’t even exist so therefore they got an F on the paper. She also counted one person as never turning in an assignment because they put DJ instead of their real name. Shall be interesting. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

english i hated the most. why idk, if i would have learned the stuff in elementary maybe i wouldnt have hated it. probably why i dont like english is its so annoying; reading is ok as long as the book is interesting; writing i hate so much, its either i have so much in my mind that idk what to write or how to start, or that i have nothing in my head to write about; also it doesnt help that i hate doing anything that isnt going to be done right the first time…</p>
<p>classes i liked: chem, math, history, german, band, and engineering(so pretty much any class that wasnt english. lol). the classes i liked most likely i liked b/c that are straight forward and so much better than english.<br>

              <p>I like to learn pretty much every subject, but history kinda annoys me. It’s because you read about the past and I’m always like “What happened, happened, now get on with your life”. And I just can’t describe why I hate it so much, it’s just that I like other subjects more. My favourite is science, cuz it’s so interesting. 2nd fave is math cuz I’m awesome at it.
