    <title>Remaking Runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/remaking-runescape/428157</link>
    <description>Yes, this does have something to do with my old thread about servers.

Why do we try and remake Runescape?  It was a game that we used to love (or some may still love it) that is now on the verge of dieing.  Some may disagree, but that&#39;s not the point, the point is that allot of people miss the early days of the game.

After taking several surveys, however, most people don&#39;t really want the game to be remade.  The time it would take to not only train their character again, but also get an economy started would take years.  We can obviously can get around this with EXP rates, etc, but then it doesn&#39;t seem like Runescape anymore.  75% of the people I asked said they wouldn&#39;t have the time to do it again.  Plus, the large, vast community of hundreds of thousands wouldn&#39;t exist, there would maybe be a few thousand at most because most have either quit the game for good or still play RS today.

There are allot of things to consider, but, should we really remake the game as it was, or branch off and make our own sort of game out of it?</description>

<p>They have barely even started quests.</p>
<p>OT: Obviously a lot of people still want the old rs because <a href="http://rs2006.net" rel="nofollow noopener">rs2006.net</a> has thousands of members without a server even being online. I like a good remake but what is even better is seeing original things that no one else has created before.</p>
