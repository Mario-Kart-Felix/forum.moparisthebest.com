    <title>Is this weird?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-weird/304498</link>
    <description>Ok, so last night I had a dream in which I had pulled out my own tooth (lol) and naturally, blood was dripping from my gums. Also, this dream was livid (couldn&#39;t control it, but I could feel/taste everything) so I had tasted the blood. When I woke up, I still tasted it, and I still feel like I can a little bit now. So is this a bit weird? Or could I just be thinking about it too much? (I could really be bleeding too, but I doubt it :3)</description>

              <p>I’m not worrying, I just find it odd how I was still tasting it.<br>
And I get nose bleeds a lot from my allergies now, and my window was open, so I could have had a mini one somehow o.o oh well, I dont mind the taste of blood at all.</p>
