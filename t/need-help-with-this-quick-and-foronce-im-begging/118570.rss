    <description>First of all and by far the worst, People are appearing to NoClip, but they are not doing it, and the appear to be far away, or in a wall but if i log out and then back in their standing rite next to me!

^^ Most important ^^ i will award a admin spot on my server if you can solve

another problem

People on my server are told time after time to stop swearing, and i cant just ban people for it, its to much of a minor offense (i dont want to act like jagex now). Is their a way i can give some sort of punishment like, a Word Filter, but for words in put into it, Eg Ifplayersays&quot;Hello&quot; replacewith &quot;*****&quot; or something.

And final problem, Spells need runes, if you can solve, Admin spot on server. (this is a urgent needed code)
