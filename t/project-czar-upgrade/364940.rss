    <title>Project Czar Upgrade</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-czar-upgrade/364940</link>
    <description>Hello, and welcome to my thread, as of now I am working on adjusting a old Project Czar source I downloaded and making it more stable and give it a way more professional look. The client I will be using in this project is a custom base i&#39;ve made off of a old Galkon Client.

My purpose for doing this is very simple. Do you remember when Project Czar sources ruled the private server world? Way back before Delta was even thought about? I found Czar sources to be extremely more beginner friendly and has a lot more potential. When finished with this source I plan on releasing to all RSPS communities that I know of. Before people start harassing me that this is a bad idea, or that Czar sources will never be stable or professional I want you to check my progress and make a decision from that alone, not from your own experience. Thank you.

Progress:
Currently, I was working on cleaning up the source and using more cleaner ways to make things work. I have removed over 100+ useless commands and well over 300 things in process that are there for no reason at all. I also full integrated the client so that it has skulls, headicons, hints, etc. Also, the client I&#39;m using has full support for all 474 items, npcs, GFX, and emotes, so things like vengeance will have the correct emotes and GFXs aswell as skillcapes and godswords.

Detailed list of what i&#39;ve done:

[ul][li]Removed all specials in the server and re-done them with new hitDiffs and correct GFX masks.[/li]
[li]Added all skillcapes and emotes with correct GFXs, timers, and masks.[/li]
[li]Added a full list of NPC&#39;s worldwide to base the server off of.[/li]
[li]Removed 300 types of NPC chat above head.[/li]
[li]Removed 159 and counting useless commands.[/li]
[li]Added actual teleporting system, instead of command voids.[/li]
[li]Removed over 600 unneeded global objects aswell as over 200 deleted objects.[/li]
[li]Re-done the mage system for better timers and better formulas.[/li]
[li]Added official RuneScape stats for all 317-474 items.[/li]
[li]98% of all 15000 items wear in the right spot.[/li]
[li]Home area has been added aswell as a drop.cfg instead of loading drops through Npchandler.[/li]
[li]Correct special/energy regenerating formula.[/li]
[li]Player poisoning.[/li][/ul]


Theres more however I don&#39;t have enough time to post it all. The server is not even out of it&#39;s alpha stage yet, however, I plan on having an open beta in early November.

Media:
(I will add media when I get home from Football, I am typing this in Web Design in school.)


Please, keep all flame to yourself however, I would love some constructive criticism.</description>

<p>The fact that Allstar-Scape was based off of Czar. The owner of it did a horrible job. :([/quote]<br>
HEY! my server is allstar based… and to be honest the only thing I can say is that you are correct. Its just that I was unable to find a copy of an original czar at the time, and I was too naive to download one of the countless czar leaches.</p>
