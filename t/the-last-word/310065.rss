    <title>The last word</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-last-word/310065</link>
    <description>I found this from my english book, and decided to look it up to see whose it is since it said ANON. 

[quote=&quot;http://jefmenguin.wordpress.com/2009/07/28/id-try-to-make-more-mistakes-next-time/&quot;]The following is an excerpt from “Living, Loving, and Learning” by Leo Buscaglia (page 122). It is something Leo found in the Journal of Humanistic Psychology, and was written by an 85 year old man who learned he was dying:[/quote]

If I had my life to live over again,
I&#39;d try to make more mistakest next
time. I wouldn&#39;t be so perfect.
I&#39;d relax more. I&#39;d be sillier than I&#39;ve
been on this trip. I&#39;d take more
chances, I&#39;d take more trip,s I&#39;d climb
more mountains, I&#39;d go to more places
I&#39;ve never been to. I&#39;d eat more ice
cream and fewer peas. You see, I&#39;ve
been one of those people who never
went anywhere without a
thermometer, a hot water bottle, a
raincoat and an umbrella. If I had it to
do all over again, I&#39;d travel lighter next time. If I had it to do all over again,
I&#39;d ride more rollercoasters, 
I&#39;d watch more sunrises, and I&#39;d kiss
more babies, if I had my life to live
over again. But you see, I don&#39;t.

A really good poem in my opinion, enjoyed reading it.
