    <title>Cops n Robbers (COD4)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cops-n-robbers-cod4/239957</link>
    <description>Well recently me a few people got bored on COD and we decided to piss around and someone suggested this and we&#39;ve been scultping the rules ever since here they are at the moment
Game Setup:
Private Match
S&amp;D first to 12
Any map
Class setup:
EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE SAME PERKS AND A SHOTTY
Perk 1: Claymores
Perk 2: Sonic Boom(not overly important on this one just not juggernaut)
Perk 3: Eavesdrop(ESSENTIAL)
Teams:
Cops on one team normaly you want a third of the people to be cops.
Rules:
Robbers just run around and hide and can plant claymores, but cannot shoot at anyone.
if a cop meets a robber, they speak to thim with eavesdrop perk and tell them to go prone, essentially they can tell you to do what they like thats the lulz of it. Cops then place claymores around the perfectly still robber so if they move they get blown up. Robbers(at this point) can run for it but then if they run cops can shoot them with the shotgun. When the timer hits 1 minute robbers can knife when they are on the run but cops cannot. Stuns are aloud. When only one player from either team remains knifes are aloud to be used and the robber no longer has to be submissive. Robbers win when they kill all the cops with their claymores(or if it comes to knives then with the knives). If a robber is trapped in between a tonne of claymore he is aloud to use a grenade to kill himself if he wants and to kill someone else but he must kill himself for this to be aloud else he kets kicked. If the timer starts running out then the defending team win unless the bomb is planted. If the bomb is being planted then you are aloud to be shot at.</description>
