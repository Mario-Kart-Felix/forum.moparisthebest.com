    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;An error occurred.

Sorry, the page you are looking for is currently unavailable.
Please try again later.

If you are the system administrator of this resource then you should check the error log for details.

Faithfully yours, nginx.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The site has been doing this to me quite often (starting around 12:30 EST), refreshing usually fixes it. What&#39;s the deal?

Edit: Everytime I attempt to connect to the IRC I get this page as-well.</description>
