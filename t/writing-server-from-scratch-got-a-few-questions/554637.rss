    <title>Writing server from scratch, got a few questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-server-from-scratch-got-a-few-questions/554637</link>
    <description>So I finally decided to take the time to read up on the RS2 protocol (big thanks to all the people providing the RS Wiki with all the info btw) and right now I&#39;m at stage 3 where the client sends the user&#39;s name and pass to the server. I wanted to get a few questions out of the way before I start adding too much and have to go back..

First of all, I&#39;m not using any API&#39;s for networking. Utility features like apache&#39;s ByteBuffer are things I could write myself but I&#39;m more concerned about speed and reliability. Since java.io and java.net are such  core packages to Java, they shouldn&#39;t have security flaws.. right?

Second, the RS client supports reconnecting to lost sessions (disconnections). Should I incorporate this feature to my server? I mean, is it worth it? Do RSPS clients utilize this feature?

I need someone to explain me the ISAAC thing. I *think* I get it but I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m not at the point where I have to use or work with it yet (and when I do I&#39;ll be sure to trial/error my way out of the problem) but I don&#39;t get the point of it since RSA is disabled on RSPS clients (from what I read).

Lastly, I will be uploading the source shortly, if anyone could quickly browse through and give me feedback that would be great.</description>

4). RSA shouldn’t be disabled but in a small environment it doesn’t matter much. It prevents someone snooping on the packets from being able to send any, decipher the password and username. Because of the way RSA works; you can encrypt the data because the public key is available but you won’t be able to decrypt the data ever unless you have the private key.<br>

Interesting… do you know how the key distribution works?[/quote]</p>
<p>I assume you understand how RSA works. But the keys for the PRNG are encrypted in the RSA block therefore you could send your own keys but at the same time youd have to send all the other relevant data too, you wouldn’t be able to decrypt that data when you stand in the middle without knowing the private key.</p>

              <p>got another question; should the server session key that is returned from the client be the same as the one that is initially sent from the server?<br>
all the other data I get returned by the client seems to match except for the server session key</p>
<p>edit: the buffer doesn’t indicate that there are remaining bytes and the name and password also match so I think it has something to do with how I’m unpacking the ssk.</p>
<p>how I’m sending the long value:</p>
<p><code>
	public void writeLong(long b) {
		this.bytes[counter++] = (byte)(b&gt;&gt;56);
		this.bytes[counter++] = (byte)(b&gt;&gt;48);
		this.bytes[counter++] = (byte)(b&gt;&gt;40);
		this.bytes[counter++] = (byte)(b&gt;&gt;32);
		this.bytes[counter++] = (byte)(b&gt;&gt;24);
		this.bytes[counter++] = (byte)(b&gt;&gt;16);
		this.bytes[counter++] = (byte)(b&gt;&gt;8);
		this.bytes[counter++] = (byte)(b&amp;0xff);
	}</code></p>
<p>how I’m reading the long value:</p>
<p><code>	public long readLong() {
		long val = 0;
		val |= bytes[counter++];
		val &lt;&lt;= 8;
		val |= bytes[counter++];
		val &lt;&lt;= 8;
		val |= bytes[counter++];
		val &lt;&lt;= 8;
		val |= bytes[counter++];
		val &lt;&lt;= 8;
		val |= bytes[counter++];
		val &lt;&lt;= 8;
		val |= bytes[counter++];
		val &lt;&lt;= 8;
		val |= bytes[counter++];
		val &lt;&lt;= 8;
		val |= bytes[counter++];
		return (long)val;
	}</code></p>

<p>1). Security flaws are usually oversights in how a user can interact with the application in a malicious intent.<br>
2). It’s a feature therefore its a choice.<br>
3). ISSAC is a PRNG used to obfuscate the ids of packets.<br>
4). RSA shouldn’t be disabled but in a small environment it doesn’t matter much. It prevents someone snooping on the packets from being able to send any, decipher the password and username.
