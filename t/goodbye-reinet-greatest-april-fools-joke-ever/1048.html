Could you fill me in or too busy?<br>Sean: well besides that ive had it with everyone?<br>raggaz: I know that. I can understand it perfectly.<br>The only thing I Dont understand is why Nattawat.<br>Sean: well he never really had the money really<br>did he<br>it was all pixels, you cant lose what u never really had<br>its not like i took it from his pocket or family<br>wat all was he going to do with it<br>buy a faster comp?<br>raggaz: But this goes agaist everything you've been argueing for, for the past year or so.<br>Sean: Ive had the same laptop for over 3 years and its always overheating<br>raggaz: I remember we one has a HUGE arguement on the seriousness of scamming, and you would always back the arguement that it is USD, not pixels<br>Sean: yea<br>well maybe over time people started to see it the way you did<br>i dunno what am i supposed to do, apologizer?<br>Im not going to<br>I'm set pretty well for a while<br>raggaz: Everybody has a point where they crack. Its nothing to be ashamed about, the amount of time and effort you've put into Reinet. I just think Nattawat is the last person i would seek revenge on<br>Sean: Unless<br>You get tired of seeing all the ipods and stuff the guy had<br>and hes in a 3rd world country<br>raggaz: ah i see.<br>Did he not donate to Reinet? I see him on the donation list.<br>Sean: yea, he did, and that is a bit of a problem<br>tbh i feel kind of bad<br>but no one else had done business with me for a long time<br>everyone kept steering around me to avoid my fees<br>raggaz: alright. So it was either nattawat or no one sort of thing?<br>Sean: but i was prtetty realistic about this<br>yea<br>raggaz: Do you believe that stuff about Micah and Shaun? My brain hurts from trying to understand this all.<br>Sean: no<br>i dont know and dont care really<br>raggaz: I mean micah, the strict religious type, framing you for WTS scams. That just doesent make sense.<br>yeah. Still its a head fuck.<br>Sean: doesnt matter, Im trying to regain FTP access and when I do Ill put a swift ebd to those that banned me and deadmined me<br>raggaz: and then what are you planning to do<br>With Reinet i mean.<br>Sean: kill the thing<br>its done with, i heard it every day<br>raggaz: Thought so.<br>Sean: maybe Ill tell the FULL story<br>raggaz: Im sure that would make sense.<br>Sean: yea but i dunno, its kind of stupid anymore<br>raggaz: In a way, was your scam just to end reinet, if you didnt scam you woudent be able to walk away. Sort of thing.<br>I remember when i quit reinet i pretended i scammed, just so it gave me a reason not to come back<br>Alot of people are heartbroken on reinet, like really<br>Sean: yea<br>well look at it from my side<br>all i ever got was ingratitude<br>evben youd come back and slam on me or the job i was trying to do<br>raggaz: I didnt intend it to be like that<br>Sean: you know after a while u look around and say is all of this worth it<br>no one really cares anyways<br>maybe the other lesson is to watch how you pushg people<br>i dunno man im not really bothered about it<br>i mean im not happy i did it<br>im kinda numb<br>raggaz: im really sorry if im part of the blame...i didnt mean to 'slam' what you were trying to do with reinet<br>a website and the person who run it are two entirely different things<br>you asked for an opinion on the website, which i gave, if the topic had been on opinions of YOU, then believe me there would be no slammings.<br>You were without doubt my <span class="hashtag">#1</span> role model on reinet<br>just so you know that i ment no hard feelings.<br>role model  / friend<br>you made it more rs focused and less of topic, so obviously i wasent gona like it, i dont play rs big_smile<br>anyway talk dude.<br>Sean: yea but did you have to bash on my work<br>it was like s lap<br>raggaz: what did i actually say, i was in such a bad mood yesterday<br>Sean: i dont no<br>dont care anymore either<br>raggaz: ye obviously.<br>i see you regained admin<br>Sean: yea, they made a big fatal error in trying to steal my ftp and block me<br>nice try but failed<br>and now im pissed<br>so, its going to get interesting<br>raggaz: lol<br>dont hurt Unholy lol<br>Sent at 12:11 PM on Monday<br>raggaz: rofl at the leeching of everyone<br>Take your time with making your big post, no point rushing it. Also, have you slept recently? Sleep changes alot of things...<br>Also if you could possibly think about giving nattwat back his stuff...then just closing reinet, so your not remembered as someone ur not...would be .... amazing<br>i mean i understand how well off he is, but he spent MONTHS writing scripts etc, which admittedly isnt as much as you have done, but he deserves what he had.<br>Sent at 12:17 PM on Monday<br>raggaz: or maybe your past caring.<br>Sean: I dunno<br>im just one man<br>i dunno what im going to do here<br><a href="http://reinet.co.uk/viewtopic.php?pid=1166736#p1166736" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://reinet.co.uk/viewtopic.php?pid=1166736#p1166736</a><br>raggaz: Do whats right. Ok i understand right and wrong are blurred here, because of the reasons you've already documented about people being ingrateful for your work, and you gaining little from it. But still theres a clear case of right and wrong concerning the nattawat thing.<br>If i were you i would move on from reinet. Fuck the site. But dont take it out on nattawat. Leave on equal karma.<br>Sean: reading your post now<br>raggaz: its rather brief but it sums up my feelings sort of<br>Sean: i kno<br>and i appreciate this<br>but man im just tired<br>thats all<br>raggaz: its not a problem, you kno i would do anything to help you out.<br>Sean: 20 hour days, ive lost 5 g in the last 3 months<br>300 m rs2 is a lot<br>thats a lot of money<br>forget the 300 usd<br>thats pocket change<br>well ok its not that much<br>mauybe 3k<br>but<br>still<br>it would have ended up banned anyways<br>raggaz: Ive held 400 mil before, and didnt take it. Its not right. You know that.<br>Sean: I know<br>i dont know why i did it<br>its just the will to hold on till im dead wasnt there\<br>ive been holding anger or something<br>i dunno i allowed people to get to me?<br>I shouldnyt have<br>raggaz: I know the feeling well.<br>Sean: i dont feel like myse;f<br>raggaz: yeah.

<p>It was, warthog was known as "the person who has never scammed" he claimed to have done over $10k US dollars in trades, and was THE OWNER of reinet, you cant get more respected than that.</p>

<p>Thats the good thing about forums like this and kaitnieks, it doesnt matter how respected somone is, they can't scam people because there is no selling, so you never have to worry about me stealing from you guys <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/wink30f4.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <img src="../../images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley30f4.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>big_smile</p>
<p>Now I'd like to thank my supporting cast :</p>
<p>All the Admins,  Kossu, Nattawat, JBJ, Matto, Juggy &lt;3 </p>
<p>All of the Mods, you know who you are</p>
<p>Jiinn, great antagonist</p>
<p>Reines, thanks for the madness...</p>
<p>Unholy, though I didn't bring you in until after most of it was over, you were a great partner, even afterwards</p>
<p>Lefty - Even though I still dont know what you mean....</p>
<p>Shaun, AKA Tupac smile   Partners in Crime for lyfe smile</p>
