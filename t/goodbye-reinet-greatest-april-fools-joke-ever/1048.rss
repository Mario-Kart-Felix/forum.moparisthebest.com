    <description>edit: haha, the greatest april fools joke ever!!!

[quote=&quot;Warthog&quot;]The day all of you got owned on the greatest April Fools day joke ever pulled on reinet,  The Title of this production was &quot;Warthog&#39;s slip into Madness&quot;!

Some members found this, and those that did were asked to PLAY ALONG WITH THE GAME, don&#39;t go spilling it!! they also now became a part of the cast.  To show that they were in on the joke, at the end of their posts, end it with an * and the others knew whos in on it and who isnt...

big_smile


Now I&#39;d like to thank my supporting cast :

All the Admins,  Kossu, Nattawat, JBJ, Matto, Juggy &lt;3 

All of the Mods, you know who you are

Jiinn, great antagonist

Reines, thanks for the madness...

Unholy, though I didn&#39;t bring you in until after most of it was over, you were a great partner, even afterwards

Lefty - Even though I still dont know what you mean....

Shaun, AKA Tupac smile   Partners in Crime for lyfe smile

And the rest of you know who you are wink

You might hate it, but most of you got owned, and damn it was fun!  smile  Got the ol blood pumping... wink

&lt;3  Warthog, yea the nice clean boring trustworthy one smile[/quote]

Well reinet is officially gone, and its left in the worst possible way a community could end, with alot of the admins/mods scamming others, including other admins/mods.  Even Warthog scammed, which is unbelievable, here is a chat log warthog himself posted, post your memories of reinet here and what you think about the chain of events.

[quote=&quot;Warthog&quot;]raggaz: I love you
Sean: smile
good
me too
raggaz: I dont really know what to say TBH, I Don&#39;t know whats going on. Could you fill me in or too busy?
Sean: well besides that ive had it with everyone?
raggaz: I know that. I can understand it perfectly.
The only thing I Dont understand is why Nattawat.
Sean: well he never really had the money really
did he
it was all pixels, you cant lose what u never really had
its not like i took it from his pocket or family
wat all was he going to do with it
buy a faster comp?
raggaz: But this goes agaist everything you&#39;ve been argueing for, for the past year or so.
Sean: Ive had the same laptop for over 3 years and its always overheating
raggaz: I remember we one has a HUGE arguement on the seriousness of scamming, and you would always back the arguement that it is USD, not pixels
Sean: yea
well maybe over time people started to see it the way you did
i dunno what am i supposed to do, apologizer?
Im not going to
I&#39;m set pretty well for a while
raggaz: Everybody has a point where they crack. Its nothing to be ashamed about, the amount of time and effort you&#39;ve put into Reinet. I just think Nattawat is the last person i would seek revenge on
Sean: Unless
You get tired of seeing all the ipods and stuff the guy had
and hes in a 3rd world country
raggaz: ah i see.
Did he not donate to Reinet? I see him on the donation list.
Sean: yea, he did, and that is a bit of a problem
tbh i feel kind of bad
but no one else had done business with me for a long time
everyone kept steering around me to avoid my fees
raggaz: alright. So it was either nattawat or no one sort of thing?
Sean: but i was prtetty realistic about this
yea
raggaz: Do you believe that stuff about Micah and Shaun? My brain hurts from trying to understand this all.
Sean: no
i dont know and dont care really
raggaz: I mean micah, the strict religious type, framing you for WTS scams. That just doesent make sense.
yeah. Still its a head fuck.
Sean: doesnt matter, Im trying to regain FTP access and when I do Ill put a swift ebd to those that banned me and deadmined me
raggaz: and then what are you planning to do
With Reinet i mean.
Sean: kill the thing
its done with, i heard it every day
raggaz: Thought so.
Sean: maybe Ill tell the FULL story
raggaz: Im sure that would make sense.
Sean: yea but i dunno, its kind of stupid anymore
raggaz: In a way, was your scam just to end reinet, if you didnt scam you woudent be able to walk away. Sort of thing.
I remember when i quit reinet i pretended i scammed, just so it gave me a reason not to come back
Alot of people are heartbroken on reinet, like really
Sean: yea
well look at it from my side
all i ever got was ingratitude
evben youd come back and slam on me or the job i was trying to do
raggaz: I didnt intend it to be like that
Sean: you know after a while u look around and say is all of this worth it
no one really cares anyways
maybe the other lesson is to watch how you pushg people
i dunno man im not really bothered about it
i mean im not happy i did it
im kinda numb
raggaz: im really sorry if im part of the blame...i didnt mean to &#39;slam&#39; what you were trying to do with reinet
a website and the person who run it are two entirely different things
you asked for an opinion on the website, which i gave, if the topic had been on opinions of YOU, then believe me there would be no slammings.
You were without doubt my #1 role model on reinet
just so you know that i ment no hard feelings.
role model  / friend
you made it more rs focused and less of topic, so obviously i wasent gona like it, i dont play rs big_smile
anyway talk dude.
Sean: yea but did you have to bash on my work
it was like s lap
raggaz: what did i actually say, i was in such a bad mood yesterday
Sean: i dont no
dont care anymore either
raggaz: ye obviously.
i see you regained admin
Sean: yea, they made a big fatal error in trying to steal my ftp and block me
nice try but failed
and now im pissed
so, its going to get interesting
raggaz: lol
dont hurt Unholy lol
Sent at 12:11 PM on Monday
raggaz: rofl at the leeching of everyone
Take your time with making your big post, no point rushing it. Also, have you slept recently? Sleep changes alot of things...
Also if you could possibly think about giving nattwat back his stuff...then just closing reinet, so your not remembered as someone ur not...would be .... amazing
i mean i understand how well off he is, but he spent MONTHS writing scripts etc, which admittedly isnt as much as you have done, but he deserves what he had.
Sent at 12:17 PM on Monday
raggaz: or maybe your past caring.
Sean: I dunno
im just one man
i dunno what im going to do here
http://reinet.co.uk/viewtopic.php?pid=1166736#p1166736
raggaz: Do whats right. Ok i understand right and wrong are blurred here, because of the reasons you&#39;ve already documented about people being ingrateful for your work, and you gaining little from it. But still theres a clear case of right and wrong concerning the nattawat thing.
If i were you i would move on from reinet. Fuck the site. But dont take it out on nattawat. Leave on equal karma.
Sean: reading your post now
raggaz: its rather brief but it sums up my feelings sort of
Sean: i kno
and i appreciate this
but man im just tired
thats all
raggaz: its not a problem, you kno i would do anything to help you out.
Sean: 20 hour days, ive lost 5 g in the last 3 months
300 m rs2 is a lot
thats a lot of money
forget the 300 usd
thats pocket change
well ok its not that much
mauybe 3k
but
still
it would have ended up banned anyways
raggaz: Ive held 400 mil before, and didnt take it. Its not right. You know that.
Sean: I know
i dont know why i did it
its just the will to hold on till im dead wasnt there\
ive been holding anger or something
i dunno i allowed people to get to me?
I shouldnyt have
raggaz: I know the feeling well.
Sean: i dont feel like myse;f
raggaz: yeah. It became to personal.
Just give the 300 mil back and move on from there. You will have a much clearer head believe me
I can hold onto it if nattwats not online, if you want to do it now :\ (hopefull thinking)
its entirely ur choice
Sean: do you really thring it would matter tho
i mean my names ruined
i cant exactly do anything now
raggaz: does it look like your ames ruined to me ?
names*
Sean: and i dunno whats up with micah, i still dont understand that part
raggaz: do you really care what all these members+leeches are saying? Your name isnt ruined to me, i know what your personality is like really.
Sean: yea i do
i do care, thats the problem
ive cared too much
raggaz: thats why i want you to show your true colours.
Sean: and its time to not care anymore
but i still care
man what have i done
im tired
no one cares
raggaz: I care
Sean: for once id like to see what people really think of me
like get the no bs truth
raggaz: Everyone with a hint of maturity cares
Sean: id like to see if ppl want natt to have the money back
nah, no i dont
i dont care
what do i care
raggaz: Your just saying that... i know you care.
Deep down
Ive known you way too long for you to try and pull that
Sean: what am i doing
why did I ever involve myself
raggaz: your trying to be the opposite of what you used to be, because your angry at reinet, i can see it.
Sean: this isnt like me at all
raggaz: no shit
why do you think everyones reacted like this
because it really isnt like you at all.
remember master ducky or w/e
i cant remember the story, but dont turn into him
Sean: yea
tbh
raggaz: give the rs2 back and then think this through with a clear head, take a sleep....
Sean: I never got over that
Ive always thought, yopu know...man dude, I gave everything to him
I trusted him
and now
raggaz: the same thing happened to me .... but an irl friend, i found out everything he told me was bullshit
ive never been the same since
Sean: ever since i couldnt fully feel comfortable or trust anyone
or let my guard down
raggaz: yeah. I have the same problems in real life
i found out mu best friend was a complete bullshitter
its hard to get over
i still trust you tho, thats the thing. Because i kno this isnt you.
Sean: and then when people leave, people i care about they stab me and slam on me and the work i was doing for them
dude out of the thousands i did in real life MM
shoot barely anythiong to show for it
raggaz: people leave because of their own problems nothing to do with you
Sean: but around the country ppl got better ipods computers etc
and me and my finances are crumbling
all ple want from me is a title
raggaz: which is why i think you should kill reinet. but leave on good terms.
Sean: you know i gave so much to others then they turn on me...over and over, and i try and hold up reinet and ask for patience and do they care...its like bash bash constantly
raggaz: I know. i feel so bad for you. but i dont want to see you go out like this.
that just makes everything worse.[/quote]</description>

<p>It was, warthog was known as "the person who has never scammed" he claimed to have done over $10k US dollars in trades, and was THE OWNER of reinet, you cant get more respected than that.</p>

<p>Well reinet is officially gone, and its left in the worst possible way a community could end, with alot of the admins/mods scamming others, including other admins/mods.  Even Warthog scammed, which is unbelievable, here is a chat log warthog himself posted, post your memories of reinet here and what you think about the chain of events.</p>
