        <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:39, topic:530020”]I very much doubt it has anything to do with making someone a global X months later. First of all because I doubt they would think that far in advance, and secondly because if they wanted to make someone a global they could do it right away anyways. There is no rule saying they need to be a sectional first. From my experience in the staff section, I’m going to guess the conversation went something like this:</p>
<p>New Topic - “amy_webb for sectional in modeling section?”<br>
Replies consisting of: “looks good”, “good contributions”, “cant see why not”, “looks like a decent attitude”</p>
<p>And then given sectional. I would bet that it wasn’t even brought up or thought much of that the section wouldn’t need much moderation.</p>
<p>(And I am not even going to respond to the idea that this had anything to do with gender, that’s outrageous on many levels, first one being the G.I.R.L internet theorem)[/quote]David I rarely agree with you mate but rep++ on everything literally.</p>
<p>One thing I would like to note though I think it was one of the admins who mentioned once that you should consider sectional as a “trial” position? Or maybe that was one of the other gmods who said that I am unsure I know I heard it somewhere.</p>
<p>And for the poster who questioned Amy’s gender… dude she’s a chick I have actually talked to her over skype before…</p>

        <p>Well, this thread has progressed further than was needed. I can assure all of you that everything was considered when we chose Amy as a sectional moderator. If we did not think that she could deliver on the job, then she would not have been chosen in the first place.</p>
<p>And as David said, any implication that we chose her because of her gender is absolute rubbish. It’s absolutely ridiculous that it was even brought up and then further believed.</p>
