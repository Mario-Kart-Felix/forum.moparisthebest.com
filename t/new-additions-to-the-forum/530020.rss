    <description>Firstly, the Moparscape Staff Team is happy to announce the newest addition to our staff team: amy_webb! She&#39;ll be moderating the RS Models &amp; Requests sections. We&#39;re sure that she&#39;ll be a great addition to the team. :)

We would also like to announce the addition of the new MoparClassic board. You may find more information about what MoparClassic is [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,648686.0.html]here[/url].</description>

              <p>Well, this thread has progressed further than was needed. I can assure all of you that everything was considered when we chose Amy as a sectional moderator. If we did not think that she could deliver on the job, then she would not have been chosen in the first place.</p>
<p>And as David said, any implication that we chose her because of her gender is absolute rubbish. It’s absolutely ridiculous that it was even brought up and then further believed.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:39, topic:530020”]I very much doubt it has anything to do with making someone a global X months later. First of all because I doubt they would think that far in advance, and secondly because if they wanted to make someone a global they could do it right away anyways. There is no rule saying they need to be a sectional first. From my experience in the staff section, I’m going to guess the conversation went something like this:</p>
<p>New Topic - “amy_webb for sectional in modeling section?”<br>
Replies consisting of: “looks good”, “good contributions”, “cant see why not”, “looks like a decent attitude”</p>
<p>And then given sectional. I would bet that it wasn’t even brought up or thought much of that the section wouldn’t need much moderation.</p>
<p>(And I am not even going to respond to the idea that this had anything to do with gender, that’s outrageous on many levels, first one being the G.I.R.L internet theorem)[/quote]David I rarely agree with you mate but rep++ on everything literally.</p>
<p>One thing I would like to note though I think it was one of the admins who mentioned once that you should consider sectional as a “trial” position? Or maybe that was one of the other gmods who said that I am unsure I know I heard it somewhere.</p>
<p>And for the poster who questioned Amy’s gender… dude she’s a chick I have actually talked to her over skype before…</p>

              <p>didn’t think people would take my post seriously, I was honestly messing around, I love Amy and I doubt it was the reason I posted (Which didn’t get removed, by the way). If anything, you can look at David’s post because that’s honestly how it probably went and usually goes.<br>
No one really thinks ahead or puts a valid thought into their post anymore, rarely.</p>

<p>I wasn’t insinuating some sort of red vs blue type of war at all, like I said I was dead serious. But, you tell me not to assume yet just before you wrote that you assume that my assumption was a bad one or by more as the wrong one at the same time as assuming that they will use it to their own evil advantage. I guess the assumption of the following metaphor, if you assume you make an ass out of u and me is quite true.</p>
<p>But don’t forget, I had already given up on any promotions so be as it is, get global. I just like a good debate.</p>

Maybe isn’t good enough lady. The other highlighted part is the only valid excuse I think is acceptable, though I had already planned ahead that someone would’ve said that days ago when this topic was first made and yes some of them do act like trolls but put them in a position of authority and I assure you they will change drastically, I bet you. And please, don’t act like you wouldn’t accept a global position, you’ve accepted the sectional position so why would being global be any different right? I like to think I touched a few nerves writing that post which I think I did but it was meant to be on a serious note in which I hope you and anyone that supports you takes it as.</p>
