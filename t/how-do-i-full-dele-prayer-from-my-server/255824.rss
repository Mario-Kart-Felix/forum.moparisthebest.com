    <title>How do i full dele prayer from my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-full-dele-prayer-from-my-server/255824</link>
    <description>hi people, you can call me rah.
my problem is, of course, prayer.
i got a old source (jordie) and it doesnt &#39;support&#39; prayer, well, it has no good codes.
im also suspect that clicking at prayer icons make people hp disapear and restart character...
What im wantingo to do, is not add good prayer codes, right icons or something... is just full delete prayer from my server..
i mean also, delete the prayer icon thats near the speelbook icon...
i think just deleting the way to get on prayer things (icon) i can solve my problem...
if anyone could help me, please do (:
thanks (:</description>

              <p>Deleting the icon that you see is client side and even if you deleted the icon you people would still be able to click and see the prayer menu so if you want to delete prayer your better off some how disabling it from the server</p>
