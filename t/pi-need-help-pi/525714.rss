    <description>I had my friend pack my sprites in Main file_Cache a while back because my cache got to big, 152 MB and i had him lower the load of it to 98 MB and he packed the MOD_ICONS, witch i specifically told him not too, but he didn&#39;t listen and ever since he has packed the cache he hasn&#39;t been on Skype since, and i unpacked the MOD_ICONS, using Tom&#39;s Cache Suite of course, and i made a new folder in sprites &quot; Players &quot; and i unpacked the MOD_ICONS in that folder, and i need help making the client read those MOD_ICONS if someone could please help me? add me on Skype? &quot; twistedrh &quot; or leave your Skype below and i will add you, and I also added admin crown, it was &quot; Donator Crown &quot; - &quot; Mod Crown &quot; - &quot; Owner Crown &quot; and i added admin crown, and since i did that the crowns are out of whack, like the owner crown is the Mod crown, its all messed up so if you could please help me? thanks to much again add me on Skype &quot; twistedrh &quot; or leave your Skype below and ill add you, Thanks!!</description>

              <p>What your saying is, when owner talks mod crown comes up?</p>
<p>All you have to do is change the <a class="mention" href="/u/cr1">@cr1</a>@ example being mod with <span class="mention">@cr4</span>@ being owner.</p>
<p>Also look in client.java for mod icons [1] etc</p>
<p>If you google something like<br>
How to add mod icons rsps, you’ll see a bunch of tuts on how to correctly do this.</p>
