    <title>Before i go to in depth</title>

    <description>Would it be against the rules to start a glitch finding group? We would exploit etc. in runescape. I do not know if this is within the rules or not, so i am posting this first. All discussion would be outside of moparscape, to avoid jagex filing any complaints. If this is allowed, then pm me for information on when to meet. We will create new rs accounts, in the event of bans. Thanks for reading. (if this is not allowed, tell me and I will delete it.)</description>
