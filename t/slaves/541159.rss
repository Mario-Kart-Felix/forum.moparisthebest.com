    <title>Slaves!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/slaves/541159</link>
    <description>It was such a simple thing to make, but I haven&#39;t seen it around by people. Ripped some stuff from summoning (the following).

Just finished the system with slaves. You can capture/tame your own slave that will carry 10 items and fight with you in multi.
[size=xx-small]Yes, females too. :3[/size]

[u][b]Capturing a slave[/b][/u]

[ol][li][b]Attack a slave.[/b] Lower its health to 40% or lower.[/li]
[li]Use a Rope on the weakened barbarian, a dialogue message will show.[/li]
[li]The barbarian will choose whether it will accept you as its dominus or not.[/li]
[li]Enjoy your slave![/li][/ol]

If you guys are really anxious, here is the formula I made up: [code](NPC&#39;s_combat_level / (150 - your_combat_level)) * 100[/code]

[b][u]What to do with your slave[/u][/b]

[ul][*]Go into multi-combat and it will help you!
[*]Store 10 items maximum.
[*]Release the slave and watch the funny cutscene.[/ul]


Major credits to Cryptosyche (a player) for the idea,
Arham

[u][b]Getting the Slave[/b][/u]

[b][u]Talking to the Slave[/u][/b]
[img]http://puu.sh/7uvUz.png[/img]
There&#39;s a little cutscene when releasing the slave which makes the slave go in joy then &quot;The Killer&quot; comes and kills the slave.

<p>Also, adding a new “potion” called Chloroform, and requiring the player to use it on the weakened barbarian, then using a rope would make things a bit more challenging.

<p>Just to correct a few people, slavery is absolutely the correct word for this. Indentured servants implies that there is a chance of release once they have worked off their debt. slavery has nothing to do with racism, that is just the historical context from which society has now derived it from. the enslavement of any type of people does not involve racism, it involves overpowering and establishing ownership over them. We read science fiction novels about how aliens enslave worlds to do their bidding, yet that in itself is not racism, it is struggle for power. Stop trying to be politically correct about a term that is being used in its politically correct form.</p>
<p>On top of that, this is in no way related to Summoning. By definition Summoning involves SUMMONING an entity. Yes the concept of fighting for, following, and attacking is the same, but beyond that this idea is its own individual concept. Water and Ice are made up of the same thing, yet they are their own things and serve their own purposes, just like this.[/quote]<br>
Hey, that’d be an awesome way to make players work for it (ie, making the chlorophyll)! Also, tribal NPCs of karamja, those would look neat! Thanks for the suggestions!</p>

              <p>Should use the term “indentured servants” as it is less offensive if people may criticize it solely for that (which I doubt). But, its a cool concept.

Interesting. I’ll add that soon (not dogs and stuff because those are “pets” (even tho not in roman times, but w/e, gotta stick with some rs stuff)).</p>
<p>And how would pirating work? There’s really not enough water in RS to add pirating (unless pirates could be on ports (ie. Port Sarim, etc)).</p>
