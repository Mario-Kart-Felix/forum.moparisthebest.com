    <title>[Clean] Project Evolved - 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clean-project-evolved-317/462155</link>
    <description>This was one of my first projects that is completely dead to me. This was cleaned out and fixed up. it barely has anything at all. So please, do not flame, OMG ITS TRASH IT HAS NOTHING IN IT! thats because it doesnt, so I understand how some of you would feel. Below are SOME features this has:

- IO Handling
- Saving / halfway Loading
- Clean Client.java (137kb)
- NPC Combat
- Item Trading
- Pickup Up Items
- Equipment
- Teleports have no GFX
- Anti Button Spamming (yay!)
- Easy access to files (src, bin folders.)
- NPC Aggression (I think)
- Supports 
- Supports Silab Items (yea i said that. get over it.)
- Attack emotes constantly Loop. (Sad Face!)
- Total of 24 files.
- Commands
- Some other stuff necessary.

This was a basic cleaned whitescape that graham had released some time ago and I was working on it for quite a while. Before anyone decides to flame on another subject, this was from 2007-08&#39;. Im simply releasing this so that people have access to basically fresh 317 server. I also packaged in a blank 317 client with an original unmodified 317 cache. (Which is not mine!)

Well, anyway, here it is. Enjoy:

Take it or leave it. Will ignore all negative comments. TY.


BELOW ARE SOME PICS OF THE SERVER. THE PIC OF THE FOLDER WITH THE FILES IS THE DROPBOX LINK YOU SEE ABOVE. I HAVE IT INSTALLED ON MY PC!

Virus scan of the file in my dropbox directly. Check the date and time, its exact. AVG doesnt display everything on one tab &gt;.&gt;</description>

<p>I did, but the way that the Client system was set up was similar to wL, which is why I said it. No care for conventions anywhere in this base, only thing that looks like it was remotely done correctly was the networking, I’ll say it again, not really that great of a base.</p>
