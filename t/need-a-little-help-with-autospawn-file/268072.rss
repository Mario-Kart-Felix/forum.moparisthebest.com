    <title>Need a little help with Autospawn file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-little-help-with-autospawn-file/268072</link>
    <description>Ok, I found a blank source and I went into it and added a npc in the Autospawn &quot;Example&quot;  Some Npc&#39;s Obviously put anything you want.

Spawn = 1597	3301	3311	0	0	0	0	0	1

I proceeded to click &quot;Compile&quot; The message came up &quot;You have just sucsessfully Compiled, press any key to continue.&quot;  I click &quot;Runserver.bat&quot;.... However he is not were I placed him.. Can someone tell me if I need to add anything? 

(NOTE: This is my first time doing this, Please do not Flame me :&#39;(.)</description>
