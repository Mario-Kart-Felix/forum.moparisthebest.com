    <title>Vba</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vba/394273</link>
    <description>Ok people I need some serious help here, anyone who knows some VBA/VB doesn&#39;t matter. Now, apparantly in VBA, you don&#39;t have the option to use global variables. For example, In my form_onload handler I had this:


[code]
Dim whatever As Boolean


then I had below that


whatever = True[/code]


Now, on the shitheadbutton_click handler I had this:


[code]
If whatever = True Then
MsgBox go fuck yourself
ElseIf whatever = False
MsgBox don&#39;t fuckyourself
End If[/code]


Now, basicly I changed the true on the onload to false to see if this has any effect and BAM, no, apparantly it didn&#39;t look at the true/false on the onload handler. Also, that BAM, the result I get from this is just the second (false) msgbox. Now I was suprised so I decided to see what happend when I just removed the onload handler completely leaving just in the whole source this:


[code]
Public Sub shitheadbutton_Click()

If whatever = True Then
MsgBox go fuck yourself
ElseIf whatever = False
MsgBox don&#39;t fuckyourself
End If
End Sub[/code]


AND IF FUCKING KEPT DISPLAYING THE SAME SHIT OVER AND OVER, IT KEPS DISPPLAYING THE FUCKING FALSE VALUE I DID NOT EVEN TOLD HIM THAT THE BOOLAEN WHATEVER EXISTS, &lt;---- sorry about that, now where was I, oh yeah, I didn&#39;t tell microsoft that the boolean whatever existed so normally a normal programming language would give me an error telling whatever does not exist but microsoft does&#39;t like to do that. Now please anyone, help, I need to get this shit working by tomorrow for school.</description>

<p>Actully they give us VBA not VB, VBA is for automating shit in access, excel, etc etc.</p>
<p>BUT I FIGURED IT OUT, I had to set the variables to Public to make them global.</p>
<p>As in,</p>
<p>Public whatever As Boolean yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee</p>
