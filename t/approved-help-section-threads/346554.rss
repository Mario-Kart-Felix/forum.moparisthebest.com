    <title>Approved Help Section Threads</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/approved-help-section-threads/346554</link>
    <description>The current server help section is currently filled with a ton of shit.

People ask questions about topics already answered, or they just post completely retarded questions that don&#39;t need a separate thread to be answered.

So my idea is that the help section should be like the old tutorial section, threads must be approved before becoming visible.

Also, the FAQs sticky should be updated to answer of few more of the commonly asked questions. Once this is done people will be forced to help themselves or actually learn.

Post your comments about this.</description>

<p>The moderators would not be able to handle it, the filtration system is gone, people can search for help on their question in the section (if they don’t we tell them to), and it would only delay them getting help.</p>
