    <title>Need help with armour/weapons not being in the right slot</title>

    <description>Hey,

I have recently downloaded a SILAB source, and have begun to make significant changes. I ran a test this afternoon and have found that a few of the armour pieces arnt in the right slot. EG the 3rd age platebody going into the leg slot and the 3rd age platelegs going into the weapon slot. Is there a way i can change this, or is it a client error.

Please help me out. 

Cheers
