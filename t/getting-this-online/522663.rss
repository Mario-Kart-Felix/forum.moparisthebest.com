    <title>Getting this online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-this-online/522663</link>
    <description>So I just recently started up an old Rsps server and I wanted to put it online.
Knowing that I didn&#39;t have to change any of the IP&#39;s because they were already set to my no-ip form before.
I did portforward my router and I checked to make sure it&#39;s open and all and it is but for some reason when I start up my server the port closes.
I went onto the online status checker for the server and when I just have the DUC program running without the server online it says its online and playable but when I start uo the server it says it is offline. I don&#39;t know what to change or what do to since I thought it would work since everything is the same as before.

Help is much appreciated,
Thanks</description>

Use a net monitor?<br>

<p>Can’t find nothing, It must be something to do with the server since it says its open but right when I start it, it closes so iddkk</p>

So you’re saying that if you go to a site like canyouseeme it says your port, 43594, is open. But if you turn on the server and check again, it says it’s closed?[/quote]</p>
<p>Precisely.</p>
