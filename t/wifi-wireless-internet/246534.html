<p>I was on my gf’s laptop the other day, noticed it had built in wireless shit, ive never used that stuff before so i decided to try it out (vista having some good features for wireless etc) so i picked up a few houses around my area, found one with 60% signal strength and no password on the router.</p>
<p>Then obviously, i downloaded as much as i could, and its still downloading right now, i got a few questions now.</p>
<p>Was looking on <a href="http://dealextreme.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">dealextreme.com</a> at some usb wireless receivers and some huge antennas to pick up wireless routers from further than normal lengths.</p>
<p>Is it worth buying this stuff? i have internet, but its always nice to use up other peoples internet usage by torrents etc (this is Australian internet, i am on a 12gb cap) so i don’t like using my internet.</p>
<p>Anyone got any discussions about wireless nets?</p>

        <p>Not sure about australia, but in sweden it’s a waste of time due to the slow speeds (8mbit max, usb-adapter anywhere). Since there are caps in australia you might get busted too.</p>

        <p>A few months back I had a neighbor who connected to my internet because I couldn’t be fucked to secure my connection.  One week I was playing xbox and noticed a severe difference in my internet speed (the neighbors had just moved in that week) and was curious as to what was going on.  I logged into my router and see both a computer and an Iphone/Itouch connected to my router (which was not mine) and I raged.  I knew it was them for sure, so I blocked their MAC addresses and I could tell they were pissed, as when I went outside they stared me down, etc.  When I found them on my internet I wasn’t exactly pleased about it, and neither was my mom, knowing that she was basically paying for them to fuck around with our internet.</p>
<p>So unless you feel like pissing someone off, I don’t suggest doing it.  They likely will try to do something about it, seeing as there is a cap on aussie internet.</p>

        <p>At my old school, they had wireless internet, but it needed a static IP on the client. So, I just set the static IP and I used wifi for the rest of the year without anyone getting angry at me. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>A few months back I had a neighbor who connected to my internet because I couldn’t be fucked to secure my connection.  One week I was playing xbox and noticed a severe difference in my internet speed (the neighbors had just moved in that week) and was curious as to what was going on.  I logged into my router and see both a computer and an Iphone/Itouch connected to my router (which was not mine) and I raged.  I knew it was them for sure, so I blocked their MAC addresses and I could tell they were pissed, as when I went outside they stared me down, etc.  When I found them on my internet I wasn’t exactly pleased about it, and neither was my mom, knowing that she was basically paying for them to fuck around with our internet.</p>
<p>So unless you feel like pissing someone off, I don’t suggest doing it.  They likely will try to do something about it, seeing as there is a cap on aussie internet.</p>

<p>This is another example that shows how retarded some people are. Tico135’s neighbors were obviously hijacking his internet connection, and when he cuts them of Tico135 is the bad guy. If I were you I’d fuck em up real hard.</p>
