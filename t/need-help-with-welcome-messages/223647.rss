    <title>Need help with Welcome Messages</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-welcome-messages/223647</link>
    <description>well, what i was hoping to do was make it so that when the owner of a server logs in, it says like: Welcome back, Owner (name)
This is proving to be a little more difficult than i expected.. lol. also i would like to know how to do it for individual names too.

Thanks</description>

              <p>You would use an if statement for their playerRights. ie, if their playerRights are 3, you’d do something along the lines of;</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(playerRights == 3) {
    statements; // this would be your sendMessage, or whatever else. sendMessage("Hi "+playerName); etc
}</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">==</span> = equals<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">&gt;=</span> = greator than or equals<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">&lt;=</span> = less than or equals<br>
For &gt;= or &lt;= you could just use greator than or less than (<span class="bbcode-b">&gt;</span> or <span class="bbcode-b">&lt;</span>)</p>
<p>As well, this would go where your original welcome messages are.</p>
