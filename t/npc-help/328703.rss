    <description>Ok, I made my NPC clickable in class5.java

when i compiled and logged on i right clicked him and he was clickable, but he&#39;s not even on the map as an NPC, and when I gave him the if NPCID command for a teleport I clicked him and it didnt work =P

is there something im doing wrong? how do I make him a npc in my server or client, he&#39;s clickable but its like he doesnt exsist.</description>
