    <description>I posted this in client help aswell, becuz i think its on the same page of my problem, it could be server or client errored

heres my problem:
-----------------------------
I made my NPC clickable in class5.java

when i compiled and logged on i right clicked him and he was clickable, but he&#39;s not even on the map as an NPC, and when I gave him the if NPCID command for a teleport I clicked him and it didnt work =P

i did all of the above in my client files
------------------------------
is there something im doing wrong? how do I make him a npc in my server or client, he&#39;s clickable but its like he doesnt exsist.


why doesnt my npc work?</description>
