    <title>Ranging Target Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ranging-target-question/16496</link>
    <description>Hey, whenever someone on my server levels up by use of the ranging targets at ::range, they are immediately disconnected. I&#39;ve been trying to find the source of this problem, but to no avail. If someone would help me, it&#39;d be greatly appreciated.
