    <title>Fast seriously fast questions!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fast-seriously-fast-questions/431330</link>
    <description>Ok questions are about Demethium 639 source
If i need to code it, does i need to code class files? _(one guy told me its possible only when you code the clas files, not java.)
If i need to code class files, how i can open them? (any program or something i dont know)
I hope i will have some nice answer, as i seen files on the source , java sided there arent anything i think, so i whana ask is it true.</description>

<p>You don’t need the Java files to run the source, because when you compile them they are converted into class files, which can be read/interpreted by any OS. However, you most likely will need the Java files beforehand, as I’m not aware of any type of program that can be used to convert the files.</p>
