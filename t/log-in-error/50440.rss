    <title>Log In Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/log-in-error/50440</link>
    <description>Hi I&#39;m currently having some problems with my server:
i compiled it and did it, but when i try to log in there is nothing but blackness in the compass, main window, and minimap, although other functions seem to work (no loading please wait either). This is very strange and i was wondering what you think i should do. Also, what I have noticed is it will save information to the moreinfo file but not to the character file.
1. It spawns you at -1, -1 disregarding where you left off at.
2. It says you leave while you stay there.
3. It won&#39;t let you leave, even if you edit your location manually, it still displays nothing, not even your character file.
4. If you do edit your character file with that, it doesnt bother to read from it, it leaves you at -1, -1.
I could go on but I&#39;d rather use my time trying to fix it.

It also does not let you click the log out button.
Also you can click sidebar interfaces, but it does not let you click any of the buttons.</description>
