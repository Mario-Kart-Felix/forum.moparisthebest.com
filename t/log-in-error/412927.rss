    <description>So my server has been acting up recently ... first of all i thought it was to do with my mySQL but i checked over it and it was fine ... then i checked the base by putting it on my desktop and trying to log in via localhost but that didnt work . it goes to the play screen with the basic sprites but a black screen ... then it goes to connection interrupted and finally logs out ... it all looks fine in the batch ...no errors in batch or in compiler ... anyone have any ideas ?</description>
