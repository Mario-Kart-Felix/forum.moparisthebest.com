    <title>Requesting Varrock South-East Iron Miner &amp; Banker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-varrock-south-east-iron-miner-banker/54481</link>
    <description>I need a Varrock South-East Iron Miner &amp; Banker.
So this is what i need it to do:

1. Start at Varrock East Bank.
2. Then will check pick-axe if in inventory or wielding.
3. Will set to run
4. Walk down to Varrock South East Mine.
5. Start mining iron.
6. Once inventory full, it will return to the Varrock East bank.
7. Then access bank account. Right-Click on the iron ores each and select store.
8. Once stored will go back to Varrock South East Mine.
9. If pick-axe head falls off, it will find it and click on it.
10. Will continue mining iron.
11. If Mysterious old man appears, it will answer him.
12. If genie appears it will answer him.
13. If any other random person appears it will talk to them.
14. It will auto talk at random times

I&#39;m willing to pay 200k for this script.

Thank-you (Who made one),
Dudeofthed.</description>
