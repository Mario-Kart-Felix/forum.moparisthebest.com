    <title>Taking my laptop screen off</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/taking-my-laptop-screen-off/295876</link>
    <description>Soon I am buying a 21.5 inch lcd monitor for my desk in my room and I will need to have the lid closed when using the screen to conserve on space but the problem is I hate to take it out and lift the lid up to turn the power on and I also heard that the screen can get damaged from heat so I think I could take the screen off and store it safely and If I need to go on a trip I will just screw it back on. Do you think this is a good idea or bad idea? I dont want to put the computer to sleep and such I just want to be able to power it on and off without flipping the lid up and down.</description>
