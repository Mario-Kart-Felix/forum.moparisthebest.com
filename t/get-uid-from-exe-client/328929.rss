    <title>Get uid from exe client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/get-uid-from-exe-client/328929</link>
    <description>So here&#39;s the deal i have been challenged by the owner of a rsps.

The challenge was to make an uber client and make it able to connect to his server so i made this uber client the only problem i have is i dont know his uid port and ip because hi&#39;s client came in a exe file (you need to install it instead of just clicking) so could anyone help me?

Btw i know i have to to the install path but when i go there i can&#39;t find the needed files to find the Uid/Port/Ip</description>

I am pretty positive when I say that the owner of the server used one of those free ‘Jar2Exe’ type of applications to superficially transform the JAR into a windows executable. If this is the case, then the only native code involved is glue code, which basically consists of creating an instance of the JVM and defining the classes within the JAR using the JNI API. Because of this, the application must store the JAR somewhere on your hard drive (as Fat Cookies stated); it might, however, be extensively hidden with a different name and extension.</p>
<p>The solution is very simple, use the attach API to locate an instance of the running client, load a Java agent into its environment, have it implement the ‘ClassFileTransformer’ interface, then invoke ‘retransformClasses’ on the ‘Instrumentation’ instance received in ‘agentmain()’ and when your implementation of the ‘transform()’ function is called, scan through the bytecode of each defined method and look for all instances of the creation of a ‘java.net.Socket’ class instance (assuming the client connects via ‘new Socket(…)’ and not through Socket.connect (if this is the case just do the same but with ‘INVOKEVIRTUAL connect(…)’ instead of with ‘NEW java/net/Socket’). Once you find it, search for the data currently available on top of the stack and output the IP and port. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

You could try hex editing but there’s no means of finding out where the uid would be stored therefore it is stupidly hard to do this.</p>

I’m sure that if the client comes with an executable installer the client jar is still dumped somewhere in the system. Go to C:\Program Files and look for the name of the client and open the folder.<br>
Find the jar, extract it and decompile the signlink class (It contains the UID iirc). Then decompile EGUI and client classes and search for the ip.</p>
