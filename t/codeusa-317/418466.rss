<p>My focus in the past two days has been -as I stated before my post was ruined because of the splash screen incident- design. The entire idea revolving around the cache editing GUI is not to hard code everything in, but rather develop two libraries that are side by side and minimize the amount of compiled code. Although I do not expect to do everything in Java, the only things I have found useful in Java are the concurrency, networking and swing packages. Although all do their job well, the entire point of what I want to eventually get to is a plugin based system for just about everything where each plugin is treated independent. Although the availability to bridge variables in plugins will be available, I will be suggesting that it shouldn’t be. These features where they are not stand alone, might just be done in Java. I have yet to further map it out.</p>
<p>The final product for building the frame was completed today, although I will need to invest some time into investigating how I will do action listeners.</p>

<p>As you can see from this, I encapsulated a frame and then added other supporting methods to help add or remove features. This is because I need to control the amount of features that a plugin developer has available to them, to help constrict and streamline the design process for creating plugins. In cases like this however, I may add some support to make sure a script such as this does not get called by outside sources unless they have specific permissions to do so. Creating a new frame such as this (minus the adding menu, setting the size, and making it visible) will be solely exclusive to this script just as the main backbone for the application. This is not a script to make new Frames as you could easily do that with the luajava.newInstance(“classname”, …params). This is to help support plugins and make their job a bit easier to add new menus and what not.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">frame:getMenuBar():addMenu("File"):addMenu("Sub"):addMenu("Sub"):addMenuItem("Finally")
frame:getMenuBar():addMenu("File"):addMenu("Sub"):addMenu("Su"):addMenuItem("Finally")
frame:getMenuBar():addMenu("Edit"):addMenuItem("Moparscape")</code></pre>
<p>One of the neat features that I am sad to report that I cannot show you, is the idea behind the tree system for menus. Since the idea of having two menus for a screen sounded fairly stupid, I just created a table for each ‘build’ script that had a table with the purpose of storing and checking what items were on a menu or menu bar.</p>

<p>I know development is slow guys, but from here on out as soon as the plugin API is finished thing will start picking up majorly. Thanks for reading this if you did, and have a great Saturday.[/quote]</p>
<p>October 22nd, Andrew is forced to learn LUA for the project.</p>
<p>Good job Sini, glad to have you.</p>

<p>October 20 -</p>
<p>I am going to keep this short and simple because I wrote a full page and at the last second Netbeans decided to fuck me over, and while I was trying to take a screen-shot of the splash screen decided that it was just going to take my mouse hostage and lock me out. So here are script files, if you understand them great if you don’t sorry I just don’t feel like explaining again.</p>

--Check if the toolkit has been bound
if toolkit ~= nil then
	return
end

--Bind the toolkit
toolkit = luajava.bindClass("java.awt.Toolkit")</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">--[[ buildsplash.lua

--Bind the splashscrn
dofile("./bin/scripts/bind/bindsplash.lua")

--Bind the alphacomp

--Bind the color
dofile("./bin/scripts/bind/bindcolor.lua")

--Create the screen

--Create splash table method

        g:setColor(color.BLACK)
        g:fillRect(120,140,200,40)

    --Update function for the table

    	t.draw()

	splash.update()

<p>Brb making sure this doesn’t happen again.</p>
<p>Well it did, ill figure it out tomorrow. Night everyone.</p>

<p>How many of you are fans of Led Zeppelin? I am not sure why but I really do love some of the remixes of their songs (although I note they are never as good as the originals), they make me feel a bit more reborn. Today was very slow day but it was fairly productive. I browsed around Fusion trying to home in on some unnecessary methods or terrible designs that I had made a month or two back and realized that I forgot to finish the floor definition. A bit of clickity clacking later, finished writing for floor definitions. From previous days I have come to the conclusion that the amount of effort and time it takes me to hard code every god damn operation code into a parsing and writing method, I could easily come up with a better solution that speeds up the process and pushes for some more more ‘advanced’ features. After I finished floors I transitioned into installing Lua on my linux computer. FOUR HOURS LATER, I figure out that there is a download that automatically configures the entire download for me. From that point it only took me 5 minutes to get the binaries and jar for the LuaJava set up, which was the only thing I really needed. For the rest of my time developing I began to make diagrams of how I thought the plugin and component system of Cosmos would take shape to look like. I believe I have a reasonable design but since it is still on the drawing board, I will hold off on explaining it just yet. I am looking forward to developing the GUI because it will be pushing my boundaries as a programmer, trying to integrate Lua and java to form a fast reliable product.</p>

<p>That took longer than it should have. If I ever have the choice of installing Lua on Ubuntu or kicking puppies, I will take the second. Work on Cosmos starts today, just working on some diagrams to get some more of my ideas flowing. Fusion is about as done as I want it for now until I hit the books and figure out some inverse kinematics for the animation editor. I always hated Taylor polynomials…</p>

<p>Most of what I complete I cannot really show you, since the way I usually test my software is through debugging it. But in the case of my sprite editor, I might make a video just showing the API off and that it isn’t just an ‘image’. Haha, maybe we have met before in a past life or whatever (No religious implications there at all). And I really appreciate it, this makes me feel a bit reborn from my past projects <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>October 18 -</p>
<p>Today was a fairly productive day, me and Dawn decided to move forward with our secret project although because of political reasons I will not be starting to assist her with the project until I finish this project and hand it over to my content team. I find it a bit amusing it took us 5 hours to think of a name and the name wasn’t really that original, since it was kinda reborn from some ideas floating around in her head. From the time I sat down at my desk to now I have been working ever so hard on NPC definitions so that I can get them the hell out of the way. The amount of data is just so…boring to write a parsing and writing method that I occasionally smash my head on my desk. I would love to know more about how the lighting system worked in conjunction with writing some functions for finding the intensity of light at a point in a triangle. But like other things mentioned before, that will have to wait. I also took an initiative to rewrite my DirectIndexSprite class to get an idea of the naming conventions and what not:</p>

<p>Removing the dummies is fairly annoying so after I found all the raster methods I had just given up and sloppily went through and punched names to all the variables. Haha, lazy programming gets to me yet again! Another thing I rewrote today was the method determining if hidden text should be shown or not be shown. It was interesting to say the least! And I must say that I can see some good future implications with all the operations that it allows me to do, especially in the case of say the player walking to a certain tile (Quests and what not). I really hate the way they work with the variable protocol so I might just add my own type of scripting system like the calculation system I studied. Well I guess that is all for now, <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> have a great night.</p>
