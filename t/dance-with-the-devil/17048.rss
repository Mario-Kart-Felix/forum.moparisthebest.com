    <title>Dance with the Devil</title>

    <description>Do you think the devil is real? Does he ever manifest himself as a human? Do you think you&#39;ve met him? Seen him at work? Heard of him on the news? 



&lt;blockquote&gt;I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
his primary concern, was making a million
being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen
he used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams
a corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen
nigga never had a father and his mom was a feen
she put the pipe down, but forever yeah she was sober
her sons heart simultaneously grew colder
he started hanging out selling bags in the projects
checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
he was fascinated by material objects
but he understood money never bought respect
he build a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
but got locked once it didn&#39;t hesitate to squeal
so criminals he chilled with didn&#39;t think he was real
you see me and niggaz like this have never been equal
I dont project my insurecurity&#39;s at other people
he feeded for props like addicts with pipes and needles
so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
a fever minded young man with infinite potetial
the product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental
coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
but he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed


Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
you propably only did a month for minor offences
ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
but then again there&#39;s always the wicked at new and advanced
dance forever with the devil on a code cell block
but thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
there&#39;s no diversity because we&#39;re burning in the melting pot


So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do
he&#39;d get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
starting fights over little shit, up on the block
stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
working overtime for making money for the crack spot
hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
for filling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
tired of the block niggaz treating him the same
he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
but when he tried to step to &#39;em, niggaz showed him no love
they told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs
any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club
but only a real thug can stab someone till they die
standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
and they wanted to test him, before business started
suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
so now he had a choice between going back to his life
or making money with made men, up in the cife
his dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three

They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
untill they saw a woman on the street walking alone
three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
and so they quietly got out the car and followed her
walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
so Billy oaked her up and grapped the chick by the hair
and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around
the shirt covered her face, but she screamed the clouts
so Billy stomped on the bitch, until he broken her jaw
the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
and then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was meant to go first, but each of them took a turn
ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
a broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren&#39;t concerned
when they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and broos
one of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two
they told him that she was a witness of what she&#39;d gone through
and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
he thought about it for a minute, she was practicly dead
and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head


I&#39;m falling and I can&#39;t turn back
I&#39;m falling and I can&#39;t turn back


Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
he thought about the cold pain with the platinum and ice
and he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
but what he saw made him start the cringine studder
cuz he was starring into the eyes of his own mother
she looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
she cried more painfully, than when they were raping her
his whole world stopped, he couldn&#39;t even contiplate
his corruption had succesfully changed his fate
and he remembered how his mom used to come home late
working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
and crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
but only the devil responded, cause god wasn&#39;t there
and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
they say death take you to a better place but I doubt it
after that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
and listen cause the story that I&#39;m telling is true
cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom to
and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
infact I&#39;m sure he&#39;s standing among one of you at my shows
and every street cypher listening to little thugs flowe
he could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn&#39;t know
the devil grows inside the hearts of the selvish and wicked
white, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted
you have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted
and you&#39;ll be one of gods children and fell from the top
there&#39;s no diversity because we&#39;re burning in the melting pot
so when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
because the dance with the devil might last you forever&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Damian (not damien) is not really related to demons or devils.</p>
<blockquote>From the Greek name Δαμιανος (Damianos) which was derived from Greek δαμαω (damao) "to tame". Saint Damian was martyred with his twin brother Cosmo early in the 4th century. They are the patron saints of physicians. Another saint by this name was Saint Peter Damian, an 11th-century cardinal and theologian from Italy.</blockquote>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Do you think the devil is real? Does he ever manifest himself as a human? Do you think you’ve met him? Seen him at work? Heard of him on the news?</p>
<blockquote>I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
his primary concern, was making a million
being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen
he used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams
a corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen
nigga never had a father and his mom was a feen
she put the pipe down, but forever yeah she was sober
her sons heart simultaneously grew colder
he started hanging out selling bags in the projects
checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
he was fascinated by material objects
but he understood money never bought respect
he build a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
but got locked once it didn't hesitate to squeal
so criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
you see me and niggaz like this have never been equal
I dont project my insurecurity's at other people
he feeded for props like addicts with pipes and needles
so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
a fever minded young man with infinite potetial
the product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental
coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
but he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed
<p>Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences<br>
you propably only did a month for minor offences<br>
ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance<br>
but then again there’s always the wicked at new and advanced<br>
dance forever with the devil on a code cell block<br>
but thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock<br>
devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top<br>
there’s no diversity because we’re burning in the melting pot</p>
<p>So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do<br>
he’d get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew<br>
starting fights over little shit, up on the block<br>
stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock<br>
working overtime for making money for the crack spot<br>
hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine<br>
for filling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain<br>
tired of the block niggaz treating him the same<br>
he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs<br>
but when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love<br>
they told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs<br>
any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs<br>
any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood<br>
even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club<br>
but only a real thug can stab someone till they die<br>
standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes<br>
Billy realized that these men were well guarded<br>
and they wanted to test him, before business started<br>
suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted<br>
so now he had a choice between going back to his life<br>
or making money with made men, up in the cife<br>
his dreams about cars and ice, made him agree<br>
a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be<br>
and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three</p>
<p>They drove around the projects slow while it was raining<br>
smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment<br>
untill they saw a woman on the street walking alone<br>
three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home<br>
and so they quietly got out the car and followed her<br>
walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her<br>
they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor<br>
this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw<br>
so Billy oaked her up and grapped the chick by the hair<br>
and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there<br>
she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs<br>
they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground<br>
screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around<br>
the shirt covered her face, but she screamed the clouts<br>
so Billy stomped on the bitch, until he broken her jaw<br>
the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing<br>
they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving<br>
blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently<br>
and then they all proceeded to rape her violently<br>
Billy was meant to go first, but each of them took a turn<br>
ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned<br>
a broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren’t concerned<br>
when they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and broos<br>
one of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two<br>
they told him that she was a witness of what she’d gone through<br>
and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew<br>
he thought about it for a minute, she was practicly dead<br>
and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head</p>
<p>I’m falling and I can’t turn back<br>
I’m falling and I can’t turn back</p>
<p>Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life<br>
he thought about the cold pain with the platinum and ice<br>
and he felt strong standing along with his new brothers<br>
cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover<br>
but what he saw made him start the cringine studder<br>
cuz he was starring into the eyes of his own mother<br>
she looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her<br>
she cried more painfully, than when they were raping her<br>
his whole world stopped, he couldn’t even contiplate<br>
his corruption had succesfully changed his fate<br>
and he remembered how his mom used to come home late<br>
working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth<br>
he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth<br>
and crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared<br>
but only the devil responded, cause god wasn’t there<br>
and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold<br>
and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul<br>
they say death take you to a better place but I doubt it<br>
after that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it<br>
and listen cause the story that I’m telling is true<br>
cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom to<br>
and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go<br>
infact I’m sure he’s standing among one of you at my shows<br>
and every street cypher listening to little thugs flowe<br>
he could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn’t know<br>
the devil grows inside the hearts of the selvish and wicked<br>
white, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted<br>
you have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted<br>
and you’ll be one of gods children and fell from the top<br>
there’s no diversity because we’re burning in the melting pot<br>
so when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never<br>
because the dance with the devil might last you forever</p>
