    <title>Adding Bandos and stuff to the item.cfg</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-bandos-and-stuff-to-the-item-cfg/182842</link>
    <description>Well, i looked through the Items.cfg and there wasnt any bandos or helmet of nez or however you spell it, so i got the item ids and i added em in but when i compile and run the server when ever people try too get on they get blackscreened and log out.. when they try too get in it says your already online. I have the same problem when i try and log in. 


Also i add everything too their specific spots in the Item4.java and its still showing up as weapons.

Its not that im stupid its just that the source had none of that in it.  I can tell why =\.</description>
