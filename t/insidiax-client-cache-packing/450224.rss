    <title>InsidiaX Client Cache packing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/insidiax-client-cache-packing/450224</link>
    <description>[color=black][b]Okay, well I&#39;m somewhat new to Java programming. Not entirely though. I have been trying to create new methods to make it so the Titlebox and the titlebutton on my client (I&#39;m using InsidiaX) Project Insanity, 317 loading a 634 cache. I can use Tom&#39;s Cache Editor, I can see the titlebox and titlebutton in there. I exported them to my desktop, edited them. I kept them the same size and everything just changed the color. Regardless, I imported them both into the cache editor and as I did that I hit save archive, and then I get a message saying that the cache has been repacked successfully. I reload the client, and nothing has changed. Also, I have looked for the sprites in the sprites folder of my cache, and neither of the .png&#39;s are in there. Can someone maybe catch what I&#39;m doing wrong here? Also, just an off topic question, is there even a way to make clients fullscreen? I can&#39;t find anything on a search, all i need is a simple answer yes or no so i can continue my search or not. Thanks in advance! Best of luck in helping me out!</description>
