[b]TopStyle Lite[/b][/i]

[code]This is a well-known Windows CSS editor that can also edit HTML code. The editor&#39;s speciality is that it allows you to create Cascading Style Sheets in a fairly simple manner - you can select the features you want from a side panel of the editor and it will generate the corresponding style sheet (you still need some CSS knowledge though - this is not a WYSIWYG editor). You can also edit HTML code with the editor. The Lite version, which is free, only allows you to create inline Cascading Style Sheets. The Pro version (not free) allows you to create external style sheets and includes built-in validators that checks your style sheets and HTML documents for correctness (among other features).[/code]

[i][b]Notepad++[/b][/i]

[code]
 Syntax Highlighting and Syntax Folding  
 
 
 Supported languages : 
C C++ Java C# XML HTML 
PHP CSS makefile ASCII art (.nfo) doxygen ini file 
batch file Javascript ASP VB/VBS SQL Objective-C 
RC resource file Pascal Perl Python Lua TeX 
TCL Assembler Ruby Lisp Scheme Properties 
Diff Smalltalk Postscript VHDL Ada Caml 
AutoIt KiXtart Matlab Verilog Haskell InnoSetup 
CMake 
 
 WYSIWYG  
 
 
 If you have a colour printer, print your source code (or whatever you want) in colour.  
 User Defined Syntax Highlighting  
 
 
 It allows user to define his own language : not only the syntax highlighting keywords, but also the syntax folding keywords, comment keywords and the operators. ( screenshot1, screenshot2, screenshot3, screenshot4 ).  
 Auto-completion  
 
 
 For most supported languages, user can make his/her own API list (or download the api files from dowload section). Once the api file is ready, type Ctrl+Space to launch this action (see screenshot). For more information about Auto-completion, please see Auto-completion HOWTO.  
 Multi-Document  
 
 
 You can edit several documents at the same time.  
 Multi-View  
 
 
 You have two views at same time. That means you can visualize (edit) 2 different documents at the same time (screenshot). You can visualize (edit) in the 2 views one document at 2 different positions as well. The modification of document in one view will carry out in another view (i.e. you modify the SAME document when you are in clone mode, see screenshot).  
 Regular Expression Search/Replace supported  
 
 
 You can search and replace one string in the document by using the regular expression.  
 Full Drag ‘N&#39; Drop supported  
 
 
 You can open a document by drag &amp; drop. You can also move your document from a position (or even a view) to another by drag &amp; drop.  
 Dynamic position of Views  
 
 
 The user can set the position of the views dynamically (only in 2 views mode : the splitter can be set in horizontal or in vertical), see screenshot.  
 File Status Auto-detection  
 
 
 If you modify or delete a file which opened in Notepad++, you will be notified to update your document (reload the file or remove the file).  
 Zoom in and zoom out  
 
 
 That&#39;s another fantastic function of Scintilla component. Just see screenshot.  
 Multi-Language environment supported  
 
 
 The Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic and Hebrew Windows environments are supported. See Notepad++ under the Chinese Windows , under the Arabic Windows and under the Hebrew Windows in action screenshot.  
 Bookmark  
 
 
 User can just click on the bookmark margin (located right side of line number margin) or type Ctrl+F2 to toggle a book mark. To reach the bookmark, type just F2 (Next bookmark) or Shift+F2 (Previous bookmark). To clear all bookmarks, click the Menu Search-&gt;Clear All bookmarks. See screenshot.  
 Brace and Indent guideline Highlighting  
 
 
 When the caret stay beside of one of those symbol { } [ ] ( ) , the symbol beside of caret and its symmetric opposite symbol will be highlighted, as well as the indent guideline (if any) in order to locate the block more easily. See screenshot1, screenshot2 .  
 Macro recording and playback

[php]$conf = simplexml_load_file(&quot;xml/conf.xml&quot;);
/* @var $conf SimpleXMLElement */[/php]

and from there on, $conf can be auto-completed with EVERYTHING in the class SimpleXMLElement ;)

HTML is on every web page out there, (lets not get smart now people) html basically is a layout tool it uses tags that define certain things eg <b> is bold, <br> is a new line ect ect… html can be used on its own but if i were you id learn CSS at the same time as you learn html and stay away from tables…</b></p>
