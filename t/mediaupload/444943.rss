    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mediaupload/444943</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;online Hong Kong–based company established in 2005 that ran a number of online services related to file storage and viewing. The domain names were seized and the sites shut down by the United States Department of Justice on 19 January 2012, following the indictment and arrests of the owners for allegedly operating as an organization dedicated to copyright infringement.[5] HK$330 million worth of assets were frozen by the Customs and Excise Department of Hong Kong.[6]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ok so with that said. Its a non based united states website so with out the permission from the united kingdom to shut them down that means the united states dont have the power to shut down this website. This was a world wide website that was used but billions of users and yes their was music on their the people of Mediaupload cant track this because of so many servers being used and also as i stated above the united states cant ban a world wide website with out permission from the united kingdom. So im making a website to fight for mediaupload to be Brought back to the internet. 

If you agree with me please post yes below and please post this around i want this to go around the internet</description>

</aside>
<p>that’s a bullshit argument that isn’t even relevant to the situation</p>
<p>you see, megaupload and similar websites operate in such a way that they have safe harbour status provided they comply with dmca takedown requests, you see, if a user uploads a copyrighted song to megaupload they’re fine to host it until they receive a dmca takedown request by the copyright holder of the song, megaupload HAS TO remove the file from their servers, and if they feel the dmca notice wasn’t valid they can then take the matter to the courts which will decide if the copyrighters claim is valid</p>
<p>what megaupload did instead of removing the copyrighted content from their servers was just remove the link to the material, they still hosted the copyright material and served it under a different link</p>

</aside>
<p>you mean pirate bay, mediafire, uppit, 4share and many more aren’t complying with a dmca takedown request when they are legally obligated to do so? perhaps you should report them to the relevant authorities</p>
<p>tl;dr you display about as much understanding as the politicians who want websites like megaupload etc off the web(but in the case of megaupload they actually did break the law, or at least that has yet to be seen)</p>

I feel their is still a lot behind all this and that the Us were aiming towers Mediaupload because Mediafire also is using us servers</p>

              <p>I don’t believe the US is suing megaupload. If your referring to the 330M in your quote, I suggest you read it again and learn with freezing assets means.</p>
<p>As well, you really need to research something before you try to propose an argument for it. Megaupload had US servers and accept/sent money to the US through its site. It basically outed out of the US which in terms violated US laws.</p>

<p>Well yes but i still believe that the united states shouldnt not have power to seize/arrest with out a world agreement. We are suing them for 300m $. That goes to us not anyone else so… How is it far that we can run the world wide web. Yes new zealand authorities honored it but its was based outta china/japan (dont remember) so that should give power to seize their servers</p>
