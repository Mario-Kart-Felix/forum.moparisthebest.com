    <title>First ever private server? How was it made?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/first-ever-private-server-how-was-it-made/538226</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always been interested about how someone got the source for RS2 (317, etc.) Did they remake the entire game? Did they steal the source from Jagex? Did they rip it from the cache files? If anybody knows anything about it, definitely feel free to post, I would like to learn up about the history of RS private servers.</description>

<p>The first server that got everything started spawned you in draynor (i say spawn with a grain of salt because there were no character models) and flew you west towards Falador/Port Sarim. Random items were spawned on every slot on the ground but obviously you couldn’t pick them up because the server had a minimal amount of packets functioning.</p>
<p>That was the server everyone refers to as the wL server iirc.</p>

              <p>Along time ago, a young Moparscapian headed down to Jagex HQ for a visit because he was just “passing by”. The workers at Jagex though he was just another person in love with the game and offered to give him a tour. They showed him where the game was made etc., but lucky for him the workers turned their backs for 5 mins giving him enough time to plug in his USB and steal of there files!!</p>
<p>The young one returned back to Moparscape with the ultimate swag stored on his USB memory stick and posted it on our amazing forums for us all to use <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Time passed and Jagex released newer versions. The clever programming monkeys we have today where able to download the new clients and modify the source to work with with client. Others learnt how the game was programmed and started creating their own versions of the game using the knowledge acquired from analysing the source code.</p>
<p>After a while everybody was making their own versions of the source, burying the original RuneScape source. The source was never found again.<br>
We still have the poor imitations known as “Winterlove”, “Project Insanity”, “Matrix”, etc., in memory of that lost source.</p>
<p>And we all lived happily ever after <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>long story short: winterlove got a deob client and reverse engineered it to make the first server as proof that it could be done and then everyone took his server and made different implementations of it (which is why we have so many wL based servers like PI, delta, dodian, devolution, allstar, etc.)</p>
<p>but the problem with this was that since it was the first server and was made as a proof of concept it was horribly done and at the time the knowledge on the rs2 protocol was very little resulting in a horrible server (that most of the widely used bases are based off of)</p>
<p>a lot of people knowledgeable in java and the rs2 protocol rushed to fix this problem by creating bases that were programmed properly but by then it was pretty much too late. winterlove bases had taken over. and here we are today</p>
<p>I wrote that off the top of my head, so some small parts might be wrong but the main ideas are concrete. There was actually a huge thread based on this topic, with a huge story and even a diagram <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> <span class="bbcode-s">with a bit of scavenging you should be able to find it!

From what I understand it was more proof of concept than anything else. Once whoever it was decompiled the client they wrote a server to connect to it, in the same way that Emulous, RuneSource, Hyperion etc were all written. If I’m right in saying it was WinterLove who done it, there was someone who wrote the whole history out somewhere but this was some years ago and I can’t quite remember that.<br>

              <p>I’ve always been interested about how someone got the source for RS2 (317, etc.) Did they remake the entire game? Did they steal the source from Jagex? Did they rip it from the cache files? If anybody knows anything about it, definitely feel free to post, I would like to learn up about the history of RS private servers.</p>
