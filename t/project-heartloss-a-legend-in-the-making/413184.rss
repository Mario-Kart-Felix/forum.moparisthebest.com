Hello yes if you saw my Project-Fame or played the beta then this is the same source, except it&#39;s remastered. Fixed Several Commands and added some zones, But this project is far from over I need 2 more coders to help finish it, the server is done but I want some coders who can make a webclient, custom minigames, and other extras. This project still takes on the base of Project-Fame&#39;s concept, old rsps style. the newest item is BCP and that is what I wish it to stay as. Remember the days when barrows was one of the best and and mages used infinity with mage book and master wand? well I wish to recreate this, and so far I have done so with a modern twist of the new age such as edgeville as home and such. The base is Delta 317 of course but we all know that delta can be made into GREAT things. The client is fully coded by myself.
