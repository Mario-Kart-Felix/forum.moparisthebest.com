    <title>Snow/Fog/Weather</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/snow-fog-weather/72889</link>
    <description>I have no clue what happened, but herers the story.  I left my server running, and went out to eat.  Came back, and noticed there was snow.  I thought, ok, easy fix.  ::nosnow.  Then i realized that non-staff users can still see snow.  So, they were complaining.  Then, i left again, and came back, and there was fog.  So now, there is either fog or snow.  Short story, how do i get it off, or make ::nosnow for all?</description>

              <p>This occurs on many servers, usually on pimpscape ones, if you look in client.java and search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">randomweather</code></pre>
<p>Remove the whole of that int and then save/compile.</p>
<p>Be carful though, you donâ€™t want to get the satrt of the next int wrong.</p>
