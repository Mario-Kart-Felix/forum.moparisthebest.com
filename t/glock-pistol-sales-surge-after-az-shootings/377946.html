        <blockquote>After a Glock-wielding gunman killed six people at a Tucson shopping center on Jan. 8, Greg Wolff, the owner of two Arizona gun shops, told his manager to get ready for a stampede of new customers.
<p>Wolff was right. Instead of hurting sales, the massacre had the $499 semi-automatic pistols – popular with police, sport shooters and gangsters – flying out the doors of his Glockmeister stores in Mesa and Phoenix.</p>
<p>“We’re at double our volume over what we usually do,” Wolff said two days after the shooting spree that also left 14 wounded, including Democratic Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who remains in critical condition.</p>
<p>A national debate over weaknesses in state and federal gun laws stirred by the shooting has stoked fears among gun buyers that stiffer restrictions may be coming from Congress, gun dealers say. The result is that a deadly demonstration of the weapon’s effectiveness has also fired up sales of handguns in Arizona and other states, according to federal law enforcement data.</p>
<p>“When something like this happens people get worried that the government is going to ban stuff,” Wolff said.</p>
<p>Arizona gun dealers say that among the biggest sellers over the past two days is the Glock 19 made by privately held Glock GmbH, based in Deutsch-Wagram, Austria, the model used in the shooting.</p>
<p>Sales Jump</p>
<p>One-day sales of handguns in Arizona jumped 60 percent to 263 on Jan. 10 compared with 164 the corresponding Monday a year ago, the second-biggest increase of any state in the country, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation data.</p>
<p>Handgun sales rose 65 percent to 395 in Ohio; 16 percent to 672 in California; 38 percent to 348 in Illinois; and 33 percent to 206 in New York, the FBI data show. Sales increased nationally about 5 percent, to 7,906 guns.</p>
<p>Federally tracked gun sales, which are drawn from sales in gun stores that require a federal background check, also jumped following the 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech, in which 32 people were killed.</p>
<p>“Whenever there is a huge event, especially when it’s close to home, people do tend to run out and buy something to protect their family,” said Don Gallardo, a manager at Arizona Shooter’s World in Phoenix, who said that the number of people signing up for the store’s concealed weapons class doubled over the weekend. Gallardo said he expects handgun sales to climb steadily throughout the week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one has brought up the shooting either, and im sure its turned a few heads.</p>

<p>Fuck off, that’s ridiculous. The vast majority of firearm owners abide by the law; always have, always will.</p>
<p>Good on them. When gun-hating John Howard decided to ban firearms in 1996 that was the end of it, game over.<br>
The other thing I would suggest buying is steel piping that is large enough to store a firearm in it, plus endcaps etc to seal it. That way if they do really move to ban firearms at any stage, you can cache some (just be sure to bury pipes vertically to minimise chances of metal detection).</p>

<p>Haha.

<p>The reason for this is that there was a grace period, but the police wouldn’t pay you if the firearm wasn’t registered – and why would anyone give up their guns for free?</p>

Fair call. The difference for you guys is that your right to bear firearms is enshrined, at least for now. We obviously didn’t have that right to begin with, plus Australia lacks the history that drove that right in the first place, so little stood in the government’s way.<br>

Just like they shot up when gun-hating Obama was elected president.  This is quite possibly the only good thing that came out of this tragedy.  The more law-abiding citizens that are armed and able to protect themselves and others, the better.<br>

<p>No, that is flat out wrong.  This shooting was possible because this guy was bat-fuck insane.  It would have happened no matter what the gun laws were, the difference is if the others in the crowd were carrying a firearm legally, it might have been stopped before anyone but the insane guy was killed.</p>
<p>Also, the kid DID need a permit to carry the gun around, which he didn’t have.  Did that law stop him?  Then what makes you think any other gun law would have?</p>

<p>What movement?  Those are simply facts, at least the second one most certainly is.  It’s actually already been proven to an extent, a city in the state of Georgia had a rash of home invasions, until they instituted a law requiring every household in the city that was legally allowed to own a gun to keep one in their house at all times.  Immediately home invasions stopped in that town.  It’s common sense, a criminal doesn’t want an armed victim.</p>

<p>Of course I’m concerned about it, but all we can do is vote and try to talk some sense into these gun grabbers.  I think, at least currently, the majority of people see the second amendment as essential to liberty, and don’t want anything to do with weakening it.</p>

<p>What movement?  Those are simply facts, at least the second one most certainly is.  It’s actually already been proven to an extent, a city in the state of Georgia had a rash of home invasions, until they instituted a law requiring every household in the city that was legally allowed to own a gun to keep one in their house at all times.  Immediately home invasions stopped in that town.  It’s common sense, a criminal doesn’t want an armed victim.</p>

<p>Why, the pro-gun movement of course. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I’d like to read about that city, do you have the name of it? Partly because I don’t believe it was anywhere near as clear cut as that, and partly because it just sounds interesting.</p>

<p>(scroll down to ‘The Gun Law’)</p>
<blockquote>In 1982 the city passed an ordinance [Sec 34-21][13]
(a) In order to provide for the emergency management of the city, and further in order to provide for and protect the safety, security and general welfare of the city and its inhabitants, every head of household residing in the city limits is required to maintain a firearm, together with ammunition therefore.
<p>(b) Exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who suffer a physical or mental disability which would prohibit them from using such a firearm. Further exempt from the effect of this section are those heads of households who are paupers or who conscientiously oppose maintaining firearms as a result of beliefs or religious doctrine, or persons convicted of a felony.</p>

<p>First of all, the requirement for a concealed carry permit in most states is a class that teaches you everything you need to know about guns.  Here in ohio it is a 12 hour class, 10 hours of classroom instruction, and 2 hours of range time.</p>
<p>Secondly, that is the argument many anti-gun people use.  Problem is, it doesn’t hold up.  In all of the states that have passed concealed carry laws over the past 20ish years, crime has dropped, there have been no ‘wild west shootouts’ in the streets, and accidental deaths have not risen.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:15, topic:377946”]No, that is flat out wrong.  This shooting was possible because this guy was bat-fuck insane.  It would have happened no matter what the gun laws were, the difference is if the others in the crowd were carrying a firearm legally, it might have been stopped before anyone but the insane guy was killed.</p>
<p>Also, the kid DID need a permit to carry the gun around, which he didn’t have.  Did that law stop him?  Then what makes you think any other gun law would have?[/quote]</p>
<p>He didn’t need one. Every Arizona citizen above 21 can wear a concealed gun without a permit.</p>
