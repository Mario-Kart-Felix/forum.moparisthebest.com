No, that was really just sarcasm.</p>
<p>My only problem with our second amendment is the potential for public mass shootings. I support 6 month gun waits (even though it would just take a little longer for impulse shooters), higher bullet prices (will create black market though), and a fire rate limit on all semi automatic guns and no automatics whatsoever. You aren’t going to shoot a dear with an Uzi, they don’t need to be sold.</p>

<p>See. I am against the legalisation of guns, but that is only in the case of the country I live in. I would likely, myself carry a gun too if I lived in the US (or at least certain states).</p>
<p>I understand the merits of it, and why people do carry guns for protection. My argument is that wiping them out as best as possible, reduces the channels in which guns are available to everyone. Make having a gun an extremely rare occurrence, and the chances of a criminal being able to get hold of one are significantly reduced.</p>
<p>I was watching a police documentary about firearm departments who specifically work to get rid of the illegal guns in the country, and would work on stopping them getting in. A large find of weapons, described by one of the police officers was 5 weapons - being the largest he had seen. That isn’t necessarily saying much, but what does is all the weapon busts were from people involved in high-level organised crime, not petty muggings or robbery.</p>
<p>I have said it before. I have never seen a gun in the UK not carried by a police officer or someone else in the armed forces. It’d be nice to keep it that way.[/quote]</p>
<p>I understand your point as well, and have considered how it would be to wipe out all guns (which would be completely impossible in a country like the USA with at least 300 million guns).  There is a basic problem with that though, guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens aren’t just for protecting against criminals with guns.  Even assuming a world where guns don’t exist, one or even a few young healthy people stand no chance against a gang of thugs; a sick, disabled, or old person stands no chance against a young healthy thug; and so on and so forth.  Bring guns into that picture and they all have a chance where they would not previously, if you can pull a trigger, you can defend yourself.</p>
<p>@ large find of 5 guns, that’s crazy!  Here they tend to over-exaggerate too, as I think they call 7 weapons an ‘arsenal’.  I probably have 7 handguns myself, and at least 2, maybe 3 times that many long guns (shotguns, rifles, muzzle-loading rifles), I’d have to dig them all out for a complete accurate count.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Actually restriction of our second amendments rights are the cause for most mass shootings, since, before this latest one in Arizona, basically all of them happened in so-called ‘no-gun zones’, (like schools, remember Virginia Tech? two of the first killed were concealed carry holders who couldn’t carry due to the law), where criminals are the only ones carrying guns.</p>
<p>@ wait times, they are useless.  People who want a gun now would just buy it someplace else, such as from a private individual.<br>
@ high bullet prices, never heard that one before, they are already extremely expensive, and do you think for one second that a criminal that makes their living with a gun wouldn’t gladly pay an extra cost to continue?  How many criminals do you honestly think would go out and get a legitimate job simply due to the high price of ammo?  It would be none.  Not to mention it is trivial to reload your own ammo (make it yourself), I bought the equipment to do it a few years ago for about $80.</p>
<p>First of all, automatics currently aren’t legal for your average person to own, so that’s not an issue.  Semi-automatics are ‘rate limited’ by how fast your finger can move, but making them slower wouldn’t accomplish a single thing.  Do you know how easy it is to change that with nothing but a file?  In fact, give me 10 minutes with about any semi-automatic and a file or grinder and I could make it fully automatic, anyone could, it’s easy.  Also, I hear politicians all the time use the argument ‘you don’t need an assault rifle for deer hunting’, and I agree that hunting deer with an automatic wouldn’t work well at all, not to mention they are already illegal.  The problem is there are many fine semi-auto rifles for deer hunting that are considered by some to be an ‘assault rifle’.  I have 2 SKS’s for deer hunting, and AK-47s and AR-15s (civilian M16) are also great, accurate, and dependable rifles for hunting, so they DO need to be sold, there is nothing wrong with them or more dangerous than another gun.</p>
<p>Bottom line is less guns in the hands of criminals is good, but laws don’t accomplish that, they are already criminals and don’t follow laws.  So the next best thing that can be done is put more guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens, and criminals instantly get less comfortable committing crime.</p>

<p>No, that is flat out wrong.  This shooting was possible because this guy was bat-fuck insane.

<p>Surely if someone just robbed a store you wouldn’t shoot at them, if you fire a warning shot they’ll run and if you shoot at them they’ll still run and probably bring a gun next time they do it so they can defend themselves, only aggravating the problem.</p>

<p>You act as if German soldiers(read: soldiers, not officers) of WW2 really had a choice, and that the majority of the US military have frie— ok I wont even go there but one of many situations I can think of is: military protection for soldiers friends and family.</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:44, topic:377946”]Compare it to terrorists in the middle east.</p>

<p>Because the average US citizen has access to IEDs RPGs and it wouldn’t be as clear-cut as “they aren’t in a US Army™ military base, kill them”. Oh wait, it’s not opposite day. You cant claim anything like the US army is the best in the world and expect if it goes rouge that a bunch of unarmed untrained citizens by comparison will be victorious without huge losses, never mind the fact the military personnel who oppose whatever government takeover is going to bear the brunt of the dirty work, and there will almost certainly be outside intervention to make sure the people wont suffer. AH FUCKING EM</p>
<p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:47, topic:377946”]Ha, are you serious?  Some quick googling for figures shows this:</p>
<p>Active military personnel: 1,477,896<br>
Reserve personnel:	  1,458,500</p>
<p>Total US military: slightly less than 3 million</p>
<p>The best estimates for American gun ownership are about 45% or 52 million of American households owning 260 million guns.</p>
<p>So, if you make these (highly unlikely) assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>All military recalled to the USA</li>
<li>All military fight for the government, against the people, their friends and family.</li>
<li>Only one person from each household with a gun joins the rebellion.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are still talking about 52 million armed people against 3 million armed people.  And you tell me the 52 million don’t have a chance?  Maybe you just didn’t think about the sheer numbers we are talking here.[/quote]</p>
<p>You must know numbers aren’t everything even when it’s rifle vs rifle, never mind how complicated it gets when there are tanks, helicopters and planes to consider.</p>

<p>Actually restriction of our second amendments rights are the cause for most mass shootings, since, before this latest one in Arizona, basically all of them happened in so-called ‘no-gun zones’, (like schools, remember Virginia Tech? two of the first killed were concealed carry holders who couldn’t carry due to the law), where criminals are the only ones carrying guns.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I really think this is a case of correlation vs causation, gun-free zones aren’t the cause of mass-shootings but if a batshit crazy person with a gun wants to kill as many people as possible, a gun-free zone would be a good place to do it.</p>
<p>The issue shouldn’t be restricting guns(although from what I read it is a bit lax) but keeping gun free zones gun-free.</p>

        <blockquote>[b]Unfit to Stand Trial, Yet Fit to Have a Gun[/b]
<p>By Rep. Louise Slaughter, Reader Supported News</p>
<p>Earlier today, Jared Loughner, a troubled young man who is accused of shooting 20 innocent people, including my colleague, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, was found unfit to stand trial for his actions.</p>
<p>Mr. Loughner’s mental and emotional troubles have been well documented and were well known among classmates, professors and acquaintances well before Mr. Loughner opened fire on that fateful January day. Yet, despite the belief that Mr. Loughner could be a danger to himself and others, our federal laws, and our mental health system, were unable to live up to the commonsense belief that those who are mentally ill should not be able to purchase and own a gun.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our nation’s gun lobby and their allies in Congress refuse to have an open and honest conversation about how to protect the rights of responsible gun owners, while being equally vigilant in protecting the rights of all Americans to assemble in peace.</p>
<p>Congress could start by considering proposed legislation that would prohibit those on the “no fly” list from buying a gun - something they are currently allowed to do. I’ve cosponsored this bipartisan legislation along with 24 colleagues (both Republicans and Democrats), yet we are still waiting for a vote on this bill.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our nation requires a mix of improved mental health services, improved information sharing among authorities, and a stricter control of the sale and possession of guns. Yet if we can’t even debate gun control legislation in our halls of Congress, then we will never be able to ensure that our children can go to school, to church or to the local grocery store and return safely home.</p>
<p>Today’s finding is the starkest sign yet that our nation’s gun laws are broken and need to be fixed. When our nation’s laws allow a troubled individual to purchase a gun, but can’t hold that same person responsible for their actions, then it is clearer than ever that we need to act.</p>
