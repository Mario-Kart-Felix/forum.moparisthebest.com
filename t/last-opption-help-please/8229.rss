    <description>I know how much this place hates java noobs but im grtting a lot better with java and kinda of knwo it but this isnt much to do with java

im an idiot at monster drops(about the only thing ive never edited on my server) so when my hob goblins started dropign what my tryas guards should have and my abby demons dont drop anymore but my smoke devils drop what my abberent specters should i have no idea what to do.

ive tried geting thier ids and searching for the drops lists to see if somehow they had been changed but ive no idea what im doing with the lists and i would rather not mess up my server even more so if anyone can help me trouble shoot here that would be wonderful thankyou.</description>
