    <description>Hey guys! Soooo I&#39;m finally wanting to get back to try and learning how to &quot;code&quot; a server, and to kind of narrow it down I&#39;m looking for a 317 or Pi that doesn&#39;t have any customs or dumbass stuff. I&#39;m basically just wanting a &quot;cleaned&quot; source but not totally cleaned (file wise). I am a beginner so if anyone has a source and client they started with please feel free to share with me! And I know what you&#39;re gonna say, &quot;did you check google?, did you check rune-server?, Did you check moparscape server downloads? And the answer is YES. And neither of those sites have what I&#39;m looking for. I know someone out there could be some assistance. Please let me know!</description>
