    <title>[PI] Items displaying wrong stats</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-items-displaying-wrong-stats/528357</link>
    <description>So I will try to explain myself as best as I can.

None of my items are showing their right stats for some reason, the Item Config.cfg has all the right stats for the items. But when I wear the item in-game and look at my stats they are completely different from the cfg file. I can&#39;t seem to figure out why this problem is happening and I am getting NO errors from Eclipse or anywhere else.. 
Just as an example here is what I mean:
This is the Item Config.cfg for Fire cape:
item = 6570 	Fire_cape	A_cape_of_fire.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	11	11	11	11	11	4	2
item = 10566	Fire_cape	A_cape_of_fire.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	11	11	11	11	11	4	2
item = 10637	Fire_cape	A_cape_of_fire.	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	1	11	11	11	11	11	4	2


The stats my Fire cape displays when worn in-game:
[URL=http://s425.photobucket.com/user/enahsh2o/media/Firecapebadstats.png.html][IMG]http://i425.photobucket.com/albums/pp334/enahsh2o/Firecapebadstats.png[/img][/URL]

I figured out that the first stat bonus of an item in the Item Config.cfg is the bonus that you receive in-game. So like for the Fire Cape the first bonus is 1 so you get +1 in every stat. No idea why it is doing this though or how to fix it, so please help. :\
That is what it is like for all items except different random stats but they are all the same like +1 for all or +2 for all etc..

This is a PI base.
Side Note: I know 100% that there isn&#39;t a space somewhere in the cfg file, also that would give me an error which I have none, but I checked that anyways. 
Duplicate of items isn&#39;t the problem either.
Thank you in advance. :]</description>

<p>Sorry, should of mentioned that. This isn’t the problem and all the Fire capes have the same stats in the Item Config.cfg folder anyways.</p>
<p>EDIT: Would greatly appreciate any help, still having this problem and can’t find any thing that would explain it. If there is any code you would like me to post just let me know and you shall receive. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
