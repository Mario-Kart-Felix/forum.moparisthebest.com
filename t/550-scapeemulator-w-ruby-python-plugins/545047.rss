    <title>550 ScapeEmulator w/ Ruby/Python plugins</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/550-scapeemulator-w-ruby-python-plugins/545047</link>
    <description>Hi, a while ago me and a friend started on a 550 server using ScapeEmulator by Jonneh. He quit working on it and I had problems irl and couldn&#39;t work on it. 

[b][u]Currently the server has:[/u][/b]

[ul][li]Walking (A*)[/li]
[li]Talking[/li]
[li]Packet handling[/li]
[li]Update server[/li]
[li]Bunch of other stuff[/li][/ul]


The core is written in Java (of course) which is pretty much done, and has a skeleton (that needs finishing) for the Ruby plugins. It can have Python plugins too so that people who want to write content using Python instead of Ruby can. 

[b][u]Requirements[/u][/b]

[ul][li]Know to use GitHub[/li]
[li]Know how to use Maven[/li]
[li]Knowledge with Java and [u]good[/u] knowledge with either Ruby or Python[/li]
[li]Dedication[/li][/ul]


The aim is to create a server that has basic things such as combat, pvm, pvp, skilling, minigames and quests. If development turns out better then expected an official launch would be cool. 

[b]Note[/b]: if anybody has the 64bit HD libs for the 550 client, I would be very appreciative if you could give them to me :) 

I will be choosing applicants on who I think have the skills required and somebody who I think is trustworthy.</description>
