    <title>One Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-question/121574</link>
    <description>Okay..How would I make an Aggressive Npc, how do I edit his stats/max hit, And how would I make him Drop things?

Thanks for any of your help, And thanks for At least Looking :)

EDIT: Came up with another question..

I was going to try to make my OWN pking rewards system, I would Probably put it in the music tab as nothing is in there. But I Dont know where I would start..If anyone Could get me started (don&#39;t just give me a code to copy and paste, I want to do this on my own) It would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks Again</description>
