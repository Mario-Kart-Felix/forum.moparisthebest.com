    <title>Whats your most embarrasing moment?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-your-most-embarrasing-moment/27960</link>
    <description>Well, basically the title speaks out.
Mine would be once in a race, I was really nervous because it was the Australian Championships.... I was lining up to the gate, waiting for it to drop, so it did, and all the riders quickly let the clutch out, I did and was so nervous I didn&#39;t even fan my clutch (Like pull it in a little bit every 2 seconds) And my bike grabbed traction, the bike started wheeling around, tossed me over the handlebars, and 2 other riders flipped over me, I didn&#39;t break any bones though.

My friend is sitting next to me as I type this, and he wants to add his 2 cents, so what the heck;
His was last year when we were riding down watching his sister play netball in the grandfinal (There was like 90 other games too) and he was riding around, and his backwheel clipped another kids, and he went off the back, and the bike went like 10 metres in the air, and hit him in the face, they had to call all the grandfinals off to get the ambulance LOL. Oh ny the way, this was on a pushbike.</description>

Never had a shocking embarrasing moment before, but the best was when my friend got pansed during gym class and his boxers came down too. Was about 5 years ago though.</p>
<p>To answer your question, yes everything was showing infront of everyone in the class.<br>
