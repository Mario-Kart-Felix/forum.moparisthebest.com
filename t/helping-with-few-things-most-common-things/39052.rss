    <description>[size=15pt][b]Please leave a comment so that I know you read these helpful things![/b][/size]

[glow=yellow,2,300]Well I am here to help you. I know a few things (ex: adding commands, editing items from shops, connecting to server, and lots more)
If you have other questions, feel free to Message me or add me. Kousinzack92@earthlink.net (thats my msn) or kousinzackk1992 (thats my AIM) If I cant help you, im sorry about that!
Well I made tuts, which I will post here because I see alot of this asking for these.[/glow]
[b]~~The First F.A.Q~~
How Do I Connect To A Server?
Read this, and you will find out![/b]
[i][b]-----Getting on a server-----

=-=-=Hamachi Servers=-=-=
First you will need hamachi, as most servers you need to have this to connect.
www.hamachi.cc and find download.
Click download and download the installer.
Install the installer and you should have hamachi, or for short, HAM.
When you open this file up, it should say
&quot;This is your first time using hamachi&quot; or something along the lines of that.
Follow the tutorial until you get to the end.
Now the customized things come in.
Now in the post on whatever forum you use, you should have at least 3 inportant details, the IP of the server; the HAM Network name; and the HAM password.
You must fill these into your HAM so you can connect.
Go down the bottom of the HAM window and click the middle button, the trianglular shape button. A scroll bar sort of thing should appear with join or create. You need to join.
I need to put down an example, sorry, but it is going to be my server! 

Ok for the top box, you have to type in, BobScape (Thats the name of the HAM name)

Ok for the bottom box, you have to type in, bob (Thats the password for the HAM network)

Press Enter. If you did this correctly, the box should disappear and in your HAM window, you should see BobScape with a few names under it. If you don&#39;t, repeat the window with the HAM name and the the HAM password. Find the name BobScape or the name of the &quot;Scape&quot; you are trying to enter near one of those names. If you cannot find one, search the server thread again, it may be in there. But if there is one there right-click it and click the one saying &quot;Copy IP address.&quot; Skip the NO-IP and go to the one after it.

=-=-=NO-IP=-=-=
This method is much easier than the first method. Now, you may come across a server thread with no HAM details in it at all. This is called a NO-IP server. This is where the owner/hoster of the server likes to have words in the server IP and no HAM. Usually, they will give you the IP address, which, as I said, is words. And, again, I need an example, and lucky, it&#39;s dipsetscape.no-ip.info You only have to have that and you can go to the next step.

-=-=Connection to the actual server=-=-=
Now, the final step, now we need a client, MoparScape. You can download it from http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,6915.msg70691.html
You should read that whole post, but if you are too lazy too, you have to download from the link provided there. Extract it to wherever, My Documents, My Desktop, just remember where you put it. Go to the file and find Moparscape, right-click it, and click extract here. It should extract and you get a folder with Moparscape on it. Double-click it and go into runMoparscape.bat or Moparscape.jar. But if you are lazy to do all that! Go to www.moparisthebest.com That&#39;s the webclient it is exactly the same. (Thats the one I use. Way easier!) So open up moparscape file and run that or go to www.moparisthebest.com and it should load everything, now you have two buttons on the screen, in the middle of the page, one is Enter, the other is Start Server. You need to click start server and wait for the cache loads. It only has to download once, so next time you click it, it will go instantly. After all that click &quot;OK&quot; and you should be back to main menu. Go to File in the top-left corner, click new server, ok Hamachi users, you need to get into that window by going down to the task bar. When done, you have to copy the IP address, if you have NO IDEA of what I am talking about, go back to the set-up of HAM. After copying the IP address go back to your Moparscape and past it there...Ctrl+V and the server IP should come up. Press Ok and start server. For NO-IP users, go into the server thread and find the IP address which is in words. Copy and paste that into the New Server window click Ok and start server. Now both HAM and NO-IP click enter and you should see Username, Password, Server IP. enter your wanted username is where? The username line. And the password in the password line. LEAVE THE SERVER IP. Do not use the same Username and password than your real runescape account. You could any original name you like and dont put your password as &quot;dfgsfd&quot; you need to be able to remember it.

Click the enter, login button and you should be logging into a server. If it says error. COnsult the owner/hoster if it is online, or offline. Ask what port it is. If it is different from 43594 (like mine) you have to go file, new port, the port the owner/hoster told you, ok, start server, ok, enter, login. If not you could have had had a mental breakdown and did the tutorial wrong.

Thanks for reading, downloading and coming to our forums, the best around, Moparscape!

How Do I Get An Item To Go Into The Right Slot?
Read this to find out![/b]

[b]Purpose[/b]: [i]So an item that you have goes into the right place, for example, if something should be in capes slot, its in weapon, etc.[/i]

[b]Difficulty[/b]: [i]2-Easier really.[/i]

[b]Assumed Knowledge[/b]: [i]Just knowing how to edit and delete some numbers, and pasting.[/i]

[b]Server Base[/b]: [i]Pur3PkScape- PIMPSCAPE[/i]

[b]Classes Modified[/b]: [i]Only Item.java[/i]

[b][u]Procedure[/u][/b]
[i]First off, open your item.java(notepad one), and do you see at top where it says [code]public static int capes[], public static int boots[], public static int body[][/code] etc? well, all you do is post the item number in what you want. For Example, item 7336(rune kitesheild (h)), I put that into the public static int shields[] part. Then you compile, and login, and see if it worked. It should have worked, and your done! You can do that with any item! See how simple that was? Your finished![/i]


[b]Credits[/b]: [i]100% Me Unless somebody did this TUT before me.

[b]~~The Fifth F.A.Q.~~
How Do I Make A Weapon Not Dissappear Anymore, Or To Have A Different Emote To It?
Read this![/b]
[b]Purpose[/b]: This tut will show you how to make any weapon in your server hit with a different emote, and it will also show you how to make the weapon not dissappear if it already does. Example: When you attack something, you dont see the weapon attack, you see your fists. (like d mace, d scmitty, and d hally in pimpscape)

[b]Difficulty[/b]: 1

[b]Assumed Knowledge[/b]: Just CTRL+F and copy and pasting.

[b]Server Base[/b]: Pur3PkScape-Pimpscape source, will probably work with all of the sources.

[b]Classes Modified[/b]: Client.java

If your weapons dissappear in your server, and to change emotes to any weapon:

Open your Client.java

Search for:
[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4747) // torags hammers
{
return 2068;
}[/code]
You can add any weapon that dissapears. For example, see the 4747? That is the item ID number, so, if you want a dragon scmitty, copy the same thing under the last }, then edit 4747 to the item number of the weapon. For example, 6611, which is white scmitty. So edit 4747 to 6611. Then torags hammers to white scmitty. Then see that 2068? That is the emote the weapon uses. You can edit it to anything you want. You can edit it even to a barrows weapon! In my server, a dragon long is a flail! You see a dragon long, but hits like flail! For example, I have for my white scmitty in Pimpscape is this:
[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 6611) // white scmitty
{
return 3157;
}[/code]
That is the emote it will use the one shown(3157) is the dragon 2h special.
If you do not see the weapon there, add it. If you add it, it will not dissappear in game.
You can search for any weapon, and change the emote.
Then save, and compile. Your done and the weapon don&#39;t dissappear and it has a different emote!!
[b]Credits[/b]:
100% by me unless someone else did it before me.
Enjoy this!
Thank you.

[b]~~The Sixth F.A.Q.~~
How Do I Edit What XP I Get From Objects? (Specifically Ranged In Pimpscape)
Read this for help![/b]

[b]Purpose[/b]: To make range faster when you hit the targets.

[b]Difficulty[/b]: 2-easy if you good coder, or just smart person=)

[b]Assumed Knowledge[/b]: CTRL+C and CTRL+V (copying and pasting, and a brain:p) 

[b]Server Base[/b]: Pimpscape Source- Pur3PkScape.

[b]Classes Modified[/b]: Client.java, and thats all!

[b]Procedure[/b]
Open Client.java, and search for:[code]case 2514:[/code] search it two times so you will see something like this: [code]case 2514:
if(actionTimer == 0) {
sendMessage(&quot;You shoot at the target and get ALOT of XP.&quot;);
actionName = &quot;range1&quot;;
actionTimer = 30;
setAnimation(426);[/code]
Okay, when your there, delete all from case 2514(the target id number) all the way to the break;.
So, copy all that, and delete and place this into it: [code]case 2514:
if(actionTimer == 0) {
sendMessage(&quot;Thanks Zachary825 for fixing range.&quot;);
actionName = &quot;range1&quot;;
actionTimer = 30;
setAnimation(426);
addSkillXP((50000*playerLevel[4]), 4);
addSkillXP((50000*playerLevel[18]), 18);
addItem(1043, 10);
updateRequired = true; 
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}
break;[/code]
The 50000 means how much xp you get(really gives more but lol) you can edit it higher or lower, depending on what you like.
You can also do the same thing with dummies, hay bales, or doors. Basically anything if you know what your doing. Just right click the item(door, hay, or dummys) and go client and search case (item number of door etc here). Also you can edit the item it gives, the 1043 in the top if noted blue partyhars(10). You can also do this with prayer because its slow.
Thats it, I hope you enjoyed this tut by Zachary825.

              <p>[size=15pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Please leave a comment so that I know you read these helpful things!</span>[/size]</p>
<p>[glow=yellow,2,300]Well I am here to help you. I know a few things (ex: adding commands, editing items from shops, connecting to server, and lots more)<br>
If you have other questions, feel free to Message me or add me. <a href="mailto:Kousinzack92@earthlink.net">Kousinzack92@earthlink.net</a> (thats my msn) or kousinzackk1992 (thats my AIM) If I cant help you, im sorry about that!<br>
Well I made tuts, which I will post here because I see alot of this asking for these.[/glow]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><s>The First F.A.Q</s><br>
How Do I Connect To A Server?<br>
Read this, and you will find out!</span><br>
[i][b]-----Getting on a server-----</p>
<p>=-=-=Hamachi Servers=-=-=<br>
First you will need hamachi, as most servers you need to have this to connect.<br>
www.hamachi.cc and find download.<br>
Click download and download the installer.<br>
Install the installer and you should have hamachi, or for short, HAM.<br>
When you open this file up, it should say<br>
“This is your first time using hamachi” or something along the lines of that.<br>
Follow the tutorial until you get to the end.<br>
Now the customized things come in.<br>
Now in the post on whatever forum you use, you should have at least 3 inportant details, the IP of the server; the HAM Network name; and the HAM password.<br>
You must fill these into your HAM so you can connect.<br>
Go down the bottom of the HAM window and click the middle button, the trianglular shape button. A scroll bar sort of thing should appear with join or create. You need to join.<br>
I need to put down an example, sorry, but it is going to be my server!</p>
<p>Ok for the top box, you have to type in, BobScape (Thats the name of the HAM name)</p>
<p>Ok for the bottom box, you have to type in, bob (Thats the password for the HAM network)</p>
<p>Press Enter. If you did this correctly, the box should disappear and in your HAM window, you should see BobScape with a few names under it. If you don’t, repeat the window with the HAM name and the the HAM password. Find the name BobScape or the name of the “Scape” you are trying to enter near one of those names. If you cannot find one, search the server thread again, it may be in there. But if there is one there right-click it and click the one saying “Copy IP address.” Skip the NO-IP and go to the one after it.</p>
<p>=-=-=NO-IP=-=-=<br>
This method is much easier than the first method. Now, you may come across a server thread with no HAM details in it at all. This is called a NO-IP server. This is where the owner/hoster of the server likes to have words in the server IP and no HAM. Usually, they will give you the IP address, which, as I said, is words. And, again, I need an example, and lucky, it’s dipsetscape.no-ip.info You only have to have that and you can go to the next step.</p>
<p>-=-=Connection to the actual server=-=-=<br>
Now, the final step, now we need a client, MoparScape. You can download it from <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,6915.msg70691.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,6915.msg70691.html</a><br>
You should read that whole post, but if you are too lazy too, you have to download from the link provided there. Extract it to wherever, My Documents, My Desktop, just remember where you put it. Go to the file and find Moparscape, right-click it, and click extract here. It should extract and you get a folder with Moparscape on it. Double-click it and go into runMoparscape.bat or Moparscape.jar. But if you are lazy to do all that! Go to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> That’s the webclient it is exactly the same. (Thats the one I use. Way easier!) So open up moparscape file and run that or go to <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> and it should load everything, now you have two buttons on the screen, in the middle of the page, one is Enter, the other is Start Server. You need to click start server and wait for the cache loads. It only has to download once, so next time you click it, it will go instantly. After all that click “OK” and you should be back to main menu. Go to File in the top-left corner, click new server, ok Hamachi users, you need to get into that window by going down to the task bar. When done, you have to copy the IP address, if you have NO IDEA of what I am talking about, go back to the set-up of HAM. After copying the IP address go back to your Moparscape and past it there…Ctrl+V and the server IP should come up. Press Ok and start server. For NO-IP users, go into the server thread and find the IP address which is in words. Copy and paste that into the New Server window click Ok and start server. Now both HAM and NO-IP click enter and you should see Username, Password, Server IP. enter your wanted username is where? The username line. And the password in the password line. LEAVE THE SERVER IP. Do not use the same Username and password than your real runescape account. You could any original name you like and dont put your password as “dfgsfd” you need to be able to remember it.</p>
<p>Click the enter, login button and you should be logging into a server. If it says error. COnsult the owner/hoster if it is online, or offline. Ask what port it is. If it is different from 43594 (like mine) you have to go file, new port, the port the owner/hoster told you, ok, start server, ok, enter, login. If not you could have had had a mental breakdown and did the tutorial wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, downloading and coming to our forums, the best around, Moparscape!</p>

How Do I Get An Item To Go Into The Right Slot?<br>
Read this to find out!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Purpose</span>: <span class="bbcode-i">So an item that you have goes into the right place, for example, if something should be in capes slot, its in weapon, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty</span>: <span class="bbcode-i">2-Easier really.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Assumed Knowledge</span>: <span class="bbcode-i">Just knowing how to edit and delete some numbers, and pasting.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Server Base</span>: <span class="bbcode-i">Pur3PkScape- PIMPSCAPE</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Classes Modified</span>: <span class="bbcode-i">Only Item.java</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Procedure</span></span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">First off, open your item.java(notepad one), and do you see at top where it says <code>public static int capes[], public static int boots[], public static int body[]</code> etc? well, all you do is post the item number in what you want. For Example, item 7336(rune kitesheild (h)), I put that into the public static int shields[] part. Then you compile, and login, and see if it worked. It should have worked, and your done! You can do that with any item! See how simple that was? Your finished!</span></p>

How Do I Make A Weapon Not Dissappear Anymore, Or To Have A Different Emote To It?<br>
Read this!</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Purpose</span>: This tut will show you how to make any weapon in your server hit with a different emote, and it will also show you how to make the weapon not dissappear if it already does. Example: When you attack something, you dont see the weapon attack, you see your fists. (like d mace, d scmitty, and d hally in pimpscape)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty</span>: 1</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Assumed Knowledge</span>: Just CTRL+F and copy and pasting.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Server Base</span>: Pur3PkScape-Pimpscape source, will probably work with all of the sources.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Classes Modified</span>: Client.java</p>
<p>If your weapons dissappear in your server, and to change emotes to any weapon:</p>
<p>Open your Client.java</p>
<p>Search for:</p>
<p><code>if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4747) // torags hammers
{
return 2068;
}</code><br>
You can add any weapon that dissapears. For example, see the 4747? That is the item ID number, so, if you want a dragon scmitty, copy the same thing under the last }, then edit 4747 to the item number of the weapon. For example, 6611, which is white scmitty. So edit 4747 to 6611. Then torags hammers to white scmitty. Then see that 2068? That is the emote the weapon uses. You can edit it to anything you want. You can edit it even to a barrows weapon! In my server, a dragon long is a flail! You see a dragon long, but hits like flail! For example, I have for my white scmitty in Pimpscape is this:</p>
<p><code>if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 6611) // white scmitty
{
return 3157;
}</code><br>
That is the emote it will use the one shown(3157) is the dragon 2h special.<br>
If you do not see the weapon there, add it. If you add it, it will not dissappear in game.<br>
You can search for any weapon, and change the emote.<br>
Then save, and compile. Your done and the weapon don’t dissappear and it has a different emote!!<br>

Enjoy this!<br>
Thank you.</p>

How Do I Edit What XP I Get From Objects? (Specifically Ranged In Pimpscape)<br>
Read this for help!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Purpose</span>: To make range faster when you hit the targets.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty</span>: 2-easy if you good coder, or just smart person=)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Assumed Knowledge</span>: CTRL+C and CTRL+V (copying and pasting, and a brain:p)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Server Base</span>: Pimpscape Source- Pur3PkScape.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Classes Modified</span>: Client.java, and thats all!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Procedure</span><br>
Open Client.java, and search for:<code>case 2514:</code> search it two times so you will see something like this: <code>case 2514:
if(actionTimer == 0) {
sendMessage("You shoot at the target and get ALOT of XP.");
actionName = "range1";
actionTimer = 30;
setAnimation(426);</code><br>
Okay, when your there, delete all from case 2514(the target id number) all the way to the break;.<br>
So, copy all that, and delete and place this into it: <code>case 2514:
if(actionTimer == 0) {
sendMessage("Thanks Zachary825 for fixing range.");
actionName = "range1";
actionTimer = 30;
setAnimation(426);
addSkillXP((50000*playerLevel[4]), 4);
addSkillXP((50000*playerLevel[18]), 18);
addItem(1043, 10);
updateRequired = true; 
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}
break;</code><br>
The 50000 means how much xp you get(really gives more but lol) you can edit it higher or lower, depending on what you like.<br>
You can also do the same thing with dummies, hay bales, or doors. Basically anything if you know what your doing. Just right click the item(door, hay, or dummys) and go client and search case (item number of door etc here). Also you can edit the item it gives, the 1043 in the top if noted blue partyhars(10). You can also do this with prayer because its slow.<br>
Thats it, I hope you enjoyed this tut by Zachary825.<br>
