    <description>Here is another project, 

In the past when i have developed servers they have all been pointless. You type a command in and you get 50 mill GP. Why is that? well it&#39;s really because you have no skills that are 100% fool proof. Yes we are slightly limited on what we can do but surely we can come up with a genius method that actually makes people earn money rather than typing in a pretty command. 

I am slightly getting bored of private servers and i am trying to do something that will keep me busy. People may think &lt;blockquote&gt;oh not another go dam development&lt;/blockquote&gt; To be honest with you i couldnt really blame you. But hopefully Project PepperScape will change your minds. Over the next few months i want to develop a working Server, Client and Website that will be able to offer what people want.

I want a Server and Client that feels something similar to RuneScape but with something that brings a spark to the game. 

I dont want to be a leader in any of this. I want to be in the team and get down to working on the Server etc..

Currently i have estimated that we will need 6 Server Coders, 3 Client Coders, 3 Website Coders and possibly a few BETA testers. 

Let me explain what each group has to do:

[b]Server Coders[/b]
You would be expected to work to deadlines and in a team developing a server around a set of requirements. You will be expected to work on a certain aspect of the Server e.g shops or a certain project such as skill capes or a new skill and also you will be expected to be inventive and think of solutions to any problems.

[b]Client Coders[/b]
You will be expected to also work to deadlines and as a team but to also work in conjunction with the server coders to develop requirements that are needed by each group to successfully complete a task. 

[b]Website Coders[/b]
At the least you would need Html, Php experience and other requirements such as experience in creating websites and other aspects in the art of Website Coding. 

[b]BETA Testers[/b]
You will be assigned tasks by all of the above. You will be expected to test certain areas for sometime. You will also be expected to present valid feedback to the assigner and possibly test the same thing a number of times. Your discretion would also be needed as if you need to connect to a server we would expect you not to tell anyone about it.


Here is the current staff:

So lets get to the main business,

Please only apply if you would consider your self to be a reliable person and you should also meet the requirements of your job.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Type of job you wish to do: [/b]
[b]How often would you be willing to work per week? [/b]
[b]Have you read your job requirements? [/b]
[b]Have you tried to apply before? [/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I will reply to you as soon as possible. You can also register on the forums, this will probably get you a faster reply.

At the end of this i want a network of servers that all offer similar features. Something like worlds! all with different hosts. We could maybe have a 24/7 server in the end. Lets see how it goes!

I hope you wish to join a team that wants to make a difference to private servers.
