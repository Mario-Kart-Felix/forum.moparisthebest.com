              <p>Lol actually that first kid who posted started all this and you guys just ended up in somehow. Kinda funny how all you guys just come in and get slammed by me because of what I said.(Fail Mopar Chodes once again…)<br>
No if you want to get technical I can’t troll on my own topic lmfao but you guys can. For me this is called replying and what you guys are doing is trolling so I think you should all learn the difference.<br>
I never once said I knew what I was doing all along. I actually said I went to this other site and they helped me through 1 post but for you guys its all questions and never answers so please before you start trying to troll get your facts straight. TBH, I’m laughing so hard right now cause all you guys are doing is making a complete fool of yourself. How you may ask?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="/u/reyx7">@reyx7</a> “I’m laughing so hard right now”<br>
Who comes on a topic and says that? Lmfao That’s what made me laugh the most.</li>
<li>
<span class="mention">@xx</span> matty xx No technically I wasn’t trolling lmfao but these fail kids on here think I am. I don’t blame you for asking cause you probably understand more then these kids that you can’t troll on your own post. (Second Funniest)</li>
<li>
<a class="mention" href="/u/cole1497">@Cole1497</a> Whats the difference between being trolled and being trolled softly? I don’t see the difference but once again I cannot troll on my own post. (Third funniest)<br>
If you guys would like me to go on I will gladly do it cause there are many more.</li>

<li>Why didn’t you say that in the first place and you know what I would rather have people pay to play then be able to use my username and log on so stop saying to make it false cause if it was a GOOD idea then the console wouldn’t be saying anything. Learn something about minecraft servers before posting k?</li>
<li>I am being a prick to you guys cause you deserve it and the first KID “CoonHunter” started this whole thing with his second post and look he read what I said and never posted back. Kinda funny huh?</li>
<li>There IS NO CLIENT ON <a href="http://MINECRAFT.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">MINECRAFT.NET</a> TO DOWNLOAD FOR THE SERVER SO WHY SAY "The client IS the minecraft client cause its not there I checked everywhere.<br>
You guys keep posting the same shit over and over and its not helping. I got real help on one of the recommended sites on <a href="http://minecraft.net" rel="nofollow noopener">minecraft.net</a> and they helped me no problem with it but it seems like you guys ask way more questions then you do help people… Kinda sad how you call this a community but none of you high rep chodes know what your talking about.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/reyx7">@reyx7</a> Don’t post on my topics cause for one no one cares if you are laughing or not. This isn’t a place for you to post something retarded just cause your laughing. I’m laughing too considering you guys all post when i am being a prick you just because I called you guys out.<br>
LOL I already play checkers actually and I think I’m pretty good at it but I still play computer games and play sports at school.(Soccer, Football, baseball etc.)<br>
I bet I know more about minecraft servers now then what you all do and I learned this all in 1 day from 1 post lmfao.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/hat">@hat</a> trix Really? As I posted before your client you gave me didn’t even work when I turned online mode to false lmfao so stop thinking you know it all when you clearly don’t. I actually don’t have or host a private server all my servers have been released on google and rune-server cause those are the sites where people go on to learn and not leech like moparscape losers.(you and everyone else)<br>
Your server didn’t even work if you want to get technical cause I said I wanted flight mode on and when I turn it on it never works so what’s that saying???<br>
On my BUKKIT server I can use fly by typing a command in to do it.<br>
Yes I am a premium user and will be for as long as i continue playing minecraft servers and I have a total of 50 players online right now and my vps is hosting my minecraft server currently.[/quote]</li>

<p>the above is your client download for minecraft.</p>

If you're running on Windows and just want to set up a server easily, download Minecraft_Server.exe (802 KB) and run it.
If you want to run the server on any other OS or without GUI it's a bit more involved (see this wiki article for a tutorial). First make sure you can use java from the command line. On Linux and Mac OS X this should already be set up but on Windows you might have to tinker with the PATH environment variable. Download and run minecraft_server.jar (621 KB) with java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui.</blockquote>
<p>the above is your download for minecraft.</p>
<p>being that you have came to a buckit server community straight out of moparscape and you have no clue what you are doing, most of us figured you weren’t premium. use the client provided above to download and play, ALONG WITH THE SERVER.</p>
<p>we know what we are talking about, you dont(obviously). last post of help i am giving you. if you dont figure it out, go somewhere else.</p>
<p>flight mode doesnt give you the ability to fly, it kicks you if you are flying. change your game mode to either 1 or 2.</p>

<p>Are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>You post a simple fix question, someone answers, and you turn into a total prick.<br>
You do not need any special “client” to log into a bukkit server. If it says server outdated, then the server isn’t running on the same version as your minecraft, which I can not diagnose from here because I don’t know what version you’re on.</p>
<p>If you’re wanting a server where nobody has to pay, then you HAVE to set online mode to false to prevent the server from checking for a verified login from the <a href="http://Minecraft.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Minecraft.net</a> servers.</p>
<p>If you cannot understand beyond this, please delete your bukkit server and go play checkers or something.</p>

<ol>
<li>It says its a bad idea to leave it false CAUSE people can USE my USERNAME and be admin if they want. Why would I want that???</li>
<li>You guys aren’t helping by saying the same thing each time cause for one, you guys are wrong about that chode before helping cause he didn’t post one thing on my topic with some helpful information.</li>
<li>Don’t keep flaming my topics cause all I asked was for help not for some little 12 year olds to start some shit and act tough online when irl I’d smack the living shit out of all of you.<br>
I’m done. Ill use the sites that <a href="http://minecraft.net" rel="nofollow noopener">minecraft.net</a> recommend for help cause if you notice, this site isn’t on there. Stop making sites that you don’t even have permission to do cause all this one is, is a imitation of moparscape which is the worst site for rsps stuff.<br>
EDIT: The client IS the minecraft client isn’t helping me one bit cause if you check <a href="http://minecraft.net" rel="nofollow noopener">minecraft.net</a>, they don’t have a download for the client so how was I supposed to know I needed to go to <a href="http://thepiratebay.org" rel="nofollow noopener">thepiratebay.org</a> to get a minecraft client there? You guys MAY think you know it all buy you don’t cause for one the client that hat trix linked me to didn’t work and neither did the source he linked me to. Just stop wasting you pathetic lives on this shit and go do something else.</li>
