              <p>This is very easy.</p>
<p>Close everything and re-start you’r computer.</p>
<p>Then,open you’r server source,and go to characters to the profiles.<br>
You should see “character rights = 3” somewhere if they are owner.<br>
You should see “character rights = 2” somewhere if they are admin.<br>
You should see character rights= 1" somewhere if they are a moderator</p>
<p>You should see character rights= 0 if they are a normal player.</p>
<p>Just do this.</p>
<p>Change all the people you don’t want to be mod/admin-make thier character rights to 0.</p>
<p>If you want someone to be mod-make it character rights = 1<br>
If you want someone to be admin make character rights = 2<br>
If you want someone to be co-owner make char rights = 3</p>
<p>Normal player is char rights 0.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p>
