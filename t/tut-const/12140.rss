[center][b][u][size=30pt]Newguy45&#39;s const Tutorial[/size][/u][/b][/center] 

[center][glow=red,2,300]For this tutorial ill be referring to my scar script &quot;Gaiaonline Fisher Revamped&quot; so if you dont have it get it.[/glow][/center]

[center]To start off what is a const? Well a const is more are less a choice. In my script [glow=blue,2,300]&quot;Gaiaonline Fisher Revamped&quot;[/glow] I use a const to let the user make the decision of what rod they want to fish with.[/center]
[hr]

[center][size=30pt]How to declare a const[/size][/center]

Ok. i know what most of you are thinking you think &quot;oh man this is easy ill i have to do is:

[code]
var
varname:const;
[/code]

Right?&quot;

wrong. A const is not really a variable therefore cannot be declared under Var.

so now &quot;your wondering how am I going to do this then?&quot;

well its simple. If you would take my script [glow=blue,2,300]&quot;Gaiaonline Fisher Revamped&quot;[/glow] for example
you would see:

[img]http://tinypic.com/264rjgg.jpg[/img]

Notice how its not declared as a var the const has its own &quot;void&quot; 
when you declare a const it goes befor the begin line, just like var.
after the word &quot;const&quot; you put in your choice to be made such as:

[code]
weather=&#39;?&#39;;
[/code]

being who i am i like to comment the choices that are avalible to the script users
such as:

[code]
weather=&#39;?&#39;; // sunny or night or rainy
[/code]

telling them that they can edit that line either to:

[code]
weather=&#39;sunny&#39;;
[/code]

or

[code]
weather=&#39;rainy&#39;;
[/code]

or

[code]
weather=&#39;night&#39;;
[/code]

once there declaired give  yourself a pat on the back and continue on...
[hr]

[center][size=30pt]How to set up your const choices[/size][/center]

Ok now that we have declared are const we have to create the choices in a procedure or the computer will get mad at us = O.

once again we will take a peek at [glow=blue,2,300]&quot;Gaiaonline Fisher Revamped&quot;[/glow] to see how i set up my const.

[img]http://i6.tinypic.com/264rtav.jpg[/img]

Now after takeing a long hard look at that const what did you notice?
Every choice has a begin and end. Keep in mind if you have two begins in one of your choices you will have to end it a extra time at the end of the procedure just be careful and count your begins and ends.

now a const can vary with looks so im going to try to simulate a basic const that will write a line for the different weathers.

[code]
procedure weatherchoices;
begin
if(weather=&#39;sunny&#39;)then
begin
writeln(&#39;Its sunny outside!&#39;);
end;
if(weather=&#39;rainy&#39;)then
begin
writeln(&#39;its raining outside&#39;);
end;
if(weather=&#39;night&#39;)then
begin
writeln(&#39;Its dark outside);
end;
end;
[/code]

and that concludes my const tutorial keep an eye out because i may be adding more to it if people just cant seem to understand.
Thanks for reading and please post your errors and until then happy scripting.</description>
