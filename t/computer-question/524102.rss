    <title>Computer Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-question/524102</link>
    <description>Alright so I have re-installed Windows (the plan is/was to re-install Windows after one year, every year for my computer to make sure it remains as fast as I can make it).


I&#39;m having a bit of a problem with the keyboard and mouse functions. When I re-installed Windows for Samsung (and I have visited their website by the way, couldn&#39;t find anything that would help) I had to manually download all the drivers from their website based on the computer that I have or based on their model.


From what I know, I have downloaded all the up-to-date drivers and hope that I did at least but I have noticed that I can no longer click and have a key down (e.g. having the &#39;W&#39; key down and trying to move the mouse) - this is a BIG problem while playing a MMORPG for example (SWTOR, Diablo III etc.)


So was wondering does anyone know what I should do? I might need to mention that it DOES work while I&#39;m not using a game but will NOT work while I&#39;m actually ON the game.


Here is the computer that I have by the way:

              <p>Thanks for the help, I have figured it out as well. When I called the Rep. for Samsung, she was telling me I should have used the built-in recovery system that Samsung has. I told her that the Rep. when I called two days prior didn’t tell me this and she apologized etc., the computer is NOW the way it use to be (as if I opened it up from the box) and EXACTLY with what it needs to be like and use.</p>
