    <description>Read the things in colors...i put orange one in there...



&lt;blockquote&gt;First, Your here because you want to add talk to people on your server..Im here to teach you ....follow these simple steps and soon youl be talking your way to a annoyence. 

Id say the difficulty of this guide is 1/10its pretty easy.


STEP 1 Open Client.java and find &quot;public void customCommand&quot;

just below that you should find this 
Code (): [Select]actionAmount++;command.replaceAll(&quot;no-ip&quot;, &quot;imgay&quot;);command.replaceAll(&quot;servegame&quot;, &quot;imgay&quot;);command.trim();
It may only have actionAmount++, but dont freak out...this is fine..

paste this in below what u just found.

Code (): [Select]if (command.startsWith(&quot;pm&quot;))        {            try            {                String pmInput = command.substring(3);                int seperator = pmInput.indexOf(&quot;:&quot;);                String username = pmInput.substring(0, seperator);                String message = pmInput.substring(seperator + 1);                BufferedWriter writePM = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;./pms/&quot; + username + &quot;.txt&quot;, true));                DateFormat simple = DateFormat.getInstance();                String now = simple.format(new Date());                writePM.write(&quot;[&quot; + playerName + &quot; at &quot; + now + &quot;] &quot; + message);                writePM.newLine();                writePM.flush();                sendMessage(&quot;Successfully sent PM.&quot;);            } catch (Exception e)            {                sendMessage(&quot;Use ::pm username:message to send a message. They will receive it&quot;);                sendMessage(&quot;the next time they log on.&quot;);            }        }




now find this &quot;public void update()&quot;
you should see this right next to it...(})

paste this right above the curly thing..


Code (): [Select]try        {            File pmFile = new File(&quot;./pms/&quot; + playerName + &quot;.txt&quot;);            String pmLine;            if (pmFile.exists())            {                BufferedReader pmReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;./pms/&quot; + playerName + &quot;.txt&quot;));                sendMessage(&quot;You have new PMs!&quot;);                try                {                    while ((pmLine = pmReader.readLine()) != null)                    {                        sendMessage(pmLine);                    }                } catch (Exception e)                {                } finally                {                    pmReader.close();                    pmFile.delete();                }            } else            {                sendMessage(&quot;No new PMs.&quot;);            }        } catch (Exception e)        {            sendMessage(&quot;Error checking for PMs.&quot;);        }
Now find this.... &quot;import java.io.*;&quot;

Put this just under it.. 
Code (): [Select]import java.text.*;import java.util.Date;
This is not your usual Private messeging..its a &quot;::pm&quot; Command..

So just do this... lets say you want to talk to me.. youd type this..  ::pm butchd12: hi dude, thanks for the help.
