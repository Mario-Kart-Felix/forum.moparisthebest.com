    <title>How to make the scrip click on colors?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-the-scrip-click-on-colors/112285</link>
    <description>Hi im just starting to learn scar, and i want to make a scrip for some neopets games.

I first want to make one for evil fuzzles from beond the stars.

I so far have made it click on start game, and then im not sure what to do.

How i planned to do it was (because the aim of the game is to click on these random monsters that come out of no-where, and they are always a very vivid color, e.g red blue green etc) so what i was going to do was, make it look for the color red, blue, etc then to click on it, i think you have to set x,y as intergers, then use FindColorTolerance(var x, y: Integer; color, xs, ys, xe, ye: Integer; Tolerance: Integer): Boolean; to find color then set up a ClickMouse(x, y: Integer; Left: Boolean); with x,y being set as where to click from the color finder thingy.

But you probly read that and thought WTF is that guy thinking????? that is why i need someone to help me with this, and just make how to do it, then write that part of the script so i get an idea on how to do it.

also what i was confused about was where do i get the xs,ys,xe and ye as the box on where the acual scan for the colors are.

Thanks alot,

              <p>First off, you probably don’t want to use tolerance.  If this is a neopets game, there is NO alteration in the colors of the fuzzies (I think), so you want the color to be as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>So that would come out to something like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Begin
If (FindColor(x, y, itemcolor1,0,0,549,399)) then
  MoveMouse(x, y);
  Clickmouse(x, y, true);
If (FindColor(x, y, itemcolor2,0,0,549,399)) then
  MoveMouse(x, y);
  Clickmouse(x, y, true);
If (FindColor(x, y, itemcolor3,0,0,549,399)) then
  MoveMouse(x, y);
  Clickmouse(x, y, true);
end;</code></pre>
<p>I made a quicky to show you</p>
<p>[code]program EvilFuzzler;</p>
<p>var<br>
x,y: integer;</p>
<p>Procedure Clickem;<br>
begin<br>
If(FindColor(x,y,255,0,0,600,400)) or<br>
(FindColor(x,y,160,0,0,600,400)) or<br>
(FindColor(x,y,8370531,0,0,600,400)) or<br>
(FindColor(x,y,4849663,0,0,600,400)) or<br>
(FindColor(x,y,5570515,0,0,600,400)) then<br>
begin<br>
MoveMouse(x,y);<br>
ClickMouse(x,y,true);<br>
Wait(100);<br>
end;<br>
end;</p>
<p>begin<br>
Repeat<br>
Clickem;<br>
Until(false);<br>
end.[/code]</p>
<p>That’ll get you past the first few levels, but I didn’t set it up so it goes through by itself.  You have to stop the script, choose your upgrades, hit continue, then start the script again.<br>
You can try to go on from there.<br>
And that got me to lvl 2 with a score of 248 already. which is the score people get at around lvl 5 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
So you could possibly dummy it down a little.</p>
