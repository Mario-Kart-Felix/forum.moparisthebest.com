    <title>[REQ] Virtue [REQ]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-virtue-req/526402</link>
    <description>Many of you have seen TONS of leeches of this source. And the only server that ISNT a leech of this that used the source is Abyss.
I was wondering if anyone happens to have the Source, Client, And cache, with NO errors.
I need it. And many people try to sell it for tons.
It&#39;s not worth anywhere near 100 as people try to value it at.
One leech of this source is/has to be Kirithium, and PvP Masters.
Speaking of  PvP Masters, if you have bought the PvP masters current source from &quot;Azan&quot; the main owner of PvP Masters, YOU HAVE BEEN SCAMMED/RIPPED OFF BY HIM.
If people wish to find this source, and release a copy of it for free to me. I&#39;d MUCH appreciate it.
Thank you.
Just so you know. I know Hank &amp; Scott Perretta, the 2 owner&#39;s/dev&#39;s of the RSPS called Virtue.
So don&#39;t try anything slick.
Thanks! Bye!</description>
