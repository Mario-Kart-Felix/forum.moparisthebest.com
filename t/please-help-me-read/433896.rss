<p>Refer to my first post in this topic. So I didn’t help?<br>
You’re the person that’s wasting his time by giving him crappy help that isn’t even related to his problem.</p>

<p>What the hell are you talking about. That post was complete nonsense. Stop misleading him.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>: This isn’t a problem with portforwarding and all that jazz. Can you run ANY batch files? Is that batch file ran from another program? Are you running the console from another computer in your network? Update me with your information.</p>
