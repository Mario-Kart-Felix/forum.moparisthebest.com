    <title>Can someone explain the stream class to me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-explain-the-stream-class-to-me/404470</link>
    <description>I&#39;m playing around with packetTypes and packet sizes etc, etc, there is a lot of readUnsignedByteA() and similar methods. I&#39;ve looked over them a few times but I&#39;m still not at a complete understanding how they work. I also don&#39;t understand their correlation with buttons, objects, etc. 

Could someone please explain these things to me?</description>

              <p>That’s a little better, thanks guys.<br>
I understand the unsigned concept, as I’ve read everything on the wiki. xP</p>
<p>My question in more detail though, say I’m working with object clicking, which is the opcode for that is 31 and byte length is 6. How would I know which methods within the stream class to use to get information like the object ID, and location of the object?</p>

i don’t think java supports unsigned types - probably why<br>
[/quote]Yes it does.[/quote]</p>
<p>like what…besides char (unsigned short)</p>
