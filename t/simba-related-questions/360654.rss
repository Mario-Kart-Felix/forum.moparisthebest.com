    <title>Simba related questions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simba-related-questions/360654</link>
    <description>Hi,

I was wondering if you guys and girls have any questions regarding Simba.
The questions can vary from design, history of simba, future plans, possible features, etc.
The reason I am asking this is because I&#39;m wondering if there are any members on Mopar who would like to work with / on Simba. I know this forum is a bit java oriented [i][citation needed][/i], but any help is very welcome.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It would probably make making forms easier. If you can find a Free Software Form Editor, we can add it. We’re not going to add or buy commercial crap like Freddy does. It doesn’t fit our ideology. If you really need this I suggest you use SCAR instead. I’ve personally never had any problems creating forms without the form editor, but I don’t use forms too much either. It’s quite useless in an interpreter language like pascalscript, IMO. No multithreading, and all the form stuff has to run on Simba’s main thread. Quite a pain to work with. (The same goes for SCAR)</p>

For example using the “SetDesktopAsClient” as client for three browserwindows side by side where it would be possible to search for bitmap pictures in each browser windows without activating it. Right now im getting dizzy seeing different browserclients pop op as they get activated and are searched for bitmaps. I don’t know if this is possible at all. If you have to click in the browser-client they will off-course be activated by nature but it would be nice and maybe also use less cpu power(?) to be able to search for bitmaps visible on the screen with only activating a parent client.</p>

</aside>
<p>Simba has a (full blown) API to switch from different client targets. It can even seperate mouse and bitmap (windows, etc) targets. It just hasn’t seen much documentation love (and testing, I guess). <a href="http://wizzup.org/simbadoc/scriptref/window.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wizzup.org/simbadoc/scriptref/window.html</a></p>

I hope the plans for library wrappers for different programming languages will be realized because I would really like those bitmap-functions implemented like a library in C++ or Java etc… That way you could make your own program independently of the Simba or Scar software and that would make life easier in several ways if you (as I do) plan to make an application from scratch.</p>

<p>They are still under way. There’s no one else working on them except me and I have a few side projects at the moment, but I’ll get it to eventually.</p>

<p>Well I would prefer these few functions getting implementing instead of having to mess with the Windows API.  They have ported so many other functions so I would be rather surprised if it would be hard to implement.</p>

              <p>Hmm…I have never used Windows API. Thanks for the link. Looked at it and got dizzy but I guess I might be able to figure it out. Anyway I still would prefer that the client-functions from scar i mentioned would be implemented in Simba.</p>
<p>What I meant with the 3 point was that I would like to be able to use the FindBitmap-functions in several browser windows without having to activate each single window each time i need to find a bitmap.</p>
<p>No matter what, I have to have several browser windows open at the same time because I search bitmaps on different websites so I cant just use one client window.</p>
<p>The problem is that every time I want to find a bitmap in the other browser window, than the one currently active I have to use the function “FindWindowBySize” and thereafter “ActivateClient”, to be able to find bitmap in the other browser window. If I dont activate the other browser window the function wont find any bitmaps at all because it still uses the handle for the first browser client.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the screen could be searched without having to activate each browser window every time, because what happens is that everything gets “locked” on the desktop and I get dizzy by seeing the browser windows blinking while getting activated several times a second. Thats why I wondered if it was possible to implement a client function dedicating a part of the screen as a parent client and then be able to search all browser windows put in the parent client.</p>

              <p>Plazan, if you are running Windows, you can just make use of the native win32 API. FindWindow(…) would probably suit you. I didn’t really understand your third point, but are you talking about getting windows other than the active window? You can easily do this too with the windows API using, as said above, FindWindow(…),  EnumWindows(…), etc.</p>

<p>As soon as we have a decent interpreter and Linux works, Mac will get some more love too. The main problem is none of the developers actually have a mac. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>This sounds like an amazing project. I am personally really excited for the Mac release. It makes me happy that more programmers are coming to the Mac Side.  I recently started learning C on my mac so I would be interested to poke around in the source once its available. Perhaps once my skills increase I could help out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Anyways my question is when is the mac version coming?  ;D</p>
<p>And will be be in the form of an xcode project?</p>
<p>Or has none of this been decided yet…</p>

              <p>Ok that is just odd. And I assume MoveMouse(0, 0); moved to the top of that window as well?<br>
Also, if you start Simba from the terminal you can see when it is selecting a particular Window. (It will write some debug about trying to make it transparent + the XWindow ID; perhaps you can use that to see if it can select the flash app?</p>
<p>If you use compositing, Simba will try to make windows transparent if you’re hovering over them with the ``selector’’. I never got Firefox/TB to go transparent so that may be a XUL/X11 issue.</p>
<p>Anyway, if this doesn’t help debugging I can prepare a more debug friendly version.</p>
<p>And perhaps someone else can test the window selection as well? I really never had any problems with it.</p>

The size comes up correctly. I am using firefox but again i stated that all colors no matter what window I select even the Simba window is 0. Yeah something is wrong so I need a fix.</p>

</aside>
<p>I assume you’re referring to using Reflection for walking? Or is this not RS-related?<br>
I don’t know too much about reflection these days, guys over at SRL may be able help. (Hope I’m allowed to say this <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> )[/quote]<br>
I don’t know I assume its not getting the window correctly at all as if i try any window it always returns 0 for the color.  When I pick a window I click and hold the select a client then i drag to my location and release similar to scar.</p>
