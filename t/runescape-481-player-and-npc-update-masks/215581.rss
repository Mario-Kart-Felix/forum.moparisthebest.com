    <description>Yeah, I need help finding them..Sorry if this isn&#39;t the topic you where probably thinking of but yeah I&#39;m just having a bit of a problem when searching for these.  I&#39;m not expecting any of you to directly tell me where they are but, I would appreciate if I was somehow pointed in the right direction as to finding them.  I know that Class47 (I think...don&#39;t flame me if it&#39;s wrong) deals with Player/NPC Update Masks and many other things but my main concern as of now is to find the Player/NPC Masks and handle them serverside so that when I log-in I see an actual player model, not an invisible one.  And on a side note, where would the loading of the chatbox be located? like loading the arrows on the right side of the chatbox, the line above the username, and the little asterisk thing and again I&#39;m not expecting any of you to directly tell me where it is butort of direction or help with it I will appreciate.  Thanks for reading and hopefully you won&#39;t give a person who is just getting the grasp of Java and it&#39;s properties a hard time.  

(I know that person who is just learning or &quot;grasping&quot; at Java shoukdn&#39;t be undertaking a project like this, but I have some friends who have worked with 481 before and have guided me through how the client loads, connects, sends packets, etc and I am learning new things every day.)

After a night of searching, I think I have found Player Updating...it&#39;s Opcode 254 (I THINK). If someone can confirm this, that will be great.

And after using RSbot and it&#39;s InterfaceExplorer, I believe I found all that I need related to the Chatbox and alll of the other interfaces like Eqipment, Inventory, Stats, etc.  Thanks Qauters for the help.

3 posts and 35 views? :\

All I need to know now if the player updating opcode is correct is the NPC Update Mask which I&#39;m sure I can probably find on my own.


Oh and if this is somehow in the wrong section, sorry...I didn&#39;t really find anyother section that was suitable for this except for this section.</description>

The chatbox is an interface, so you have to see where it loads the interfaces. RSBot with InterfaceExplorer can be a great help to find the interface id's.
Interface 137 is chat box related, child interface would be your name + text etc. (Like Qauters:Hello World!*)
Child 55 is scrollbar.
The interface also contains the info related to the GE.

It’s more client related then server related at the moment and since this is a 481 client it wouldn’t fit in the 317 client hacking section that is at <a href="http://Mopar.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Mopar.org</a> and 3. well, if this is in the wrong spot/site you can lock or delete it if you want and I’ll take it over to to <a href="http://Mopar.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Mopar.org</a></p>
