    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-few-models/309441</link>
    <description>These are all the models i completed and im happy with... if you dont like them, post kinda suggestions... id love anything to help me get better:)
My Earliest Complete Model! GUTHIX GOD AXE! (why god axe? because i dont have a godsword blade model i can use atm... lol)
Picture:

My Second Complete Model(might do some repairs, the left side is a bit weird, and i want to make it more tight on the body...) Ranger Platebody
Picture:

^That&#39;s one of my favorites;) i think the dark brown area will show up like cloth(not sure though, maybe only in hd... dunno)

Ranger Platelegs(of course, it is part of the ranger armor set ive been doing :) yes, it is just a recolor, jagex gets 99.9% of credit)
[IMG]http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e61/RTSV2Nemo/rangerplatelegs.jpg[/img]

Dragon Kiteshield (one of my favorites, i remade this many times, this is my best i&#39;ve done on it... i fixed the handle and dragon tail up a bit this morning)
[IMG]http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e61/RTSV2Nemo/dragonkitepics.jpg[/img]

I also mad a jetpack, it was a 10 minute thing i was bored... but its decent, the fire is cheasey but i would have dont reallly bad if i tried to make it realistic. Here it is
Picture:

Again, any suggestions would be loved... I made all these but the legs from scratch, i used prims for the jetpack...
Credits:
God axe: 95% Me for making it even the trace i used, 5 % for Jagex for the guthix idea(and i recolored the end of a guthix staff for the hilt

Ranger Platebody: 100% Me...

Ranger Platelegs: .1% Me for spending 2 minutes recoloring... 99.9% Jagex for the model.. :D

Dragon Kite: 97% Me 3% Jagex for the idea of everything... Though the dragon symbol a remade on paint...

Jetpack: 100% Me... if you want metasquoia can have 5% for the prims...

If you want dl links i&#39;d be more that happy :)
