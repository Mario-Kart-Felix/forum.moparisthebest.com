    <title>Getting a team for Dragonpkzz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-a-team-for-dragonpkzz/311804</link>
    <description>I was looking for a semi-professional professional codeing team. I was hopeing that we could all agree on one server source, and code it out for maby a month or two. Then we go and switch into Hamachi or No-Ip. I will be the source/files holder and or host. You guys will have to help me out a little bit i havn&#39;t coded in 1[sup]1[/sup]/[sub]2[/sub] years. I usually just look at it, understand it, and mess around with it, but i want this to be professional. Once we have acomplished our no-ip server, and have enough donations, we WILL go to dedicated. I will list every1 that is on the team below.
