    <description>Well I just started my server about 2 days ago. And I have put it on every advertising site i can think of. And youtube. But yet no one plays. I mean i get 2-3 people on here or there. But on my old servers i had about 20-27 people on all the time. And the servers are both good. they have all skills. Skillcape emotes d claws. And its 317 if you were wondering.

And i cant think of anything i did different with my old server and my new one.

How can i get players online. (oh and i dont syi)

Thanks Please answer if you have the time.
