    <title>Image Flame vs Text Flame, and some staff stuff</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/image-flame-vs-text-flame-and-some-staff-stuff/295069</link>
    <description>Well, I decided to post this on behalf of AMERIKA&#39;s unfair moderation.

First off, [b]this staff is fucked up[/b]. Look at M.Dog311, the one who requested AMERIKA&#39;s moderation. Then look at `Rich, who locks every topic in the general section that might be fun to talk about, or where you just post a picture. That&#39;s also fucked up.

Now onto the topic. I want to point out some stuff staff members might not look at (Note: I used AMERIKA&#39;s situtation here).

There&#39;s 2 people on a forum. Person A and Person B. Person A posts a topic breaking the rules, and makes a fool of himself. Person B posts an image with the text that has something to do with a face palm. Now, a bad staff member (M.Dog311) would end up locking the topic properly, but then punish Person B too. Why? He used an image? If Person B had posted something like &quot;*Face palm* Wrong section...&quot;, nothing would&#39;ve happened. The topic would&#39;ve been locked, and Person B would&#39;ve remained fine.

You see what happened there? Staff (I don&#39;t know about all) treat images as worse than text, even if the image is representing something that could be expressed in words.

Oh, and I know AMERIKA&#39;s case had to do with failing, but that&#39;s beside the point. Look at the face palm situation.

Now some staff member might fight back saying &quot;He broke rule number #, which states no flaming.&quot; That would be correct, however, if they enforced that rule with [i]everyone[/i] on the forum, there would probably be green, yellow, and maybe even blue dots everywhere you go.

They also might argue with &quot;He&#39;s been warned before, etc...&quot; or &quot;He knows better.&quot;, and again, that&#39;s also true. But like I said before, that&#39;s not the case with most members. It&#39;s not enforced.

Finally, their response could be &quot;We don&#39;t have time to chase every member around the forum.&quot; If that&#39;s the case, then don&#39;t even bother tracking down specific members, because that&#39;s unfair.


So my suggestion is either enforce the flaming rule or be specific with image flaming, or stop unfairly punishing members.

Wait, they&#39;re likely to fight back with that too, with something like &quot;We&#39;re not unfairly punishing members, because they deserved it.&quot; That&#39;s right, but also wrong at the same time. Sure, they might have deserved it, but it&#39;s unfair because you&#39;re letting other members get away with what another got punished for.

Oh, and last but not least, this isn&#39;t a suggestion topic. Just a point of view, and I guess a little rant, I want others to discuss.

That&#39;s all,

~Lin</description>

AMERIKA’s moderation was not unjust at all.  I did, in-fact request it.  But as you know, I can not place the moderation.

<p>I casually browse the forums, just like any other user, accept that when I see something that is breaking a rule I have the power to do something about it. So I do. I do not track down specific member’s, I just happen to view their topics, and when there is a rule broken, the topic will be locked or the user infracted.</p>
<p>As for image posts being the same as text based posts: That is absolutly untrue, “a picture says a million words”. A picture based post can stir far more shit then a text post.</p>

<p>The staff members have the power to see some posts as ‘spam’ and some as ‘not spam’, but since the staff members, excluding Taharok, don’t warn most violators fairly, AMERIKA shouldn’t even receive a warning even though he broke the rules, despite what I stated in the first paragraph.</p>

I agree, that last case with AMERIKA was unfair.<br>
I see loads of members everyday posting, swearing their heads off, insulting others, and sometimes getting away with just a small infraction, yet AMERIKA posts one ‘fail’ picture, and he’s moderated?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>he was given a moderation cause he was already warned</p>
<p>also, I do agree that some things are taken too seriously, but I really don’t see a problem with <span class="bbcode-i">most</span> of the things I lock.[/quote]To be honest, I did go overboard on that part. Most of the stuff you lock is for a purpose, but some shouldn’t be locked.</p>

              <p>Well, I decided to post this on behalf of AMERIKA’s unfair moderation.</p>
<p>First off, <span class="bbcode-b">this staff is fucked up</span>. Look at M.Dog311, the one who requested AMERIKA’s moderation. Then look at `Rich, who locks every topic in the general section that might be fun to talk about, or where you just post a picture. That’s also fucked up.</p>
<p>Now onto the topic. I want to point out some stuff staff members might not look at (Note: I used AMERIKA’s situtation here).</p>
<p>There’s 2 people on a forum. Person A and Person B. Person A posts a topic breaking the rules, and makes a fool of himself. Person B posts an image with the text that has something to do with a face palm. Now, a bad staff member (M.Dog311) would end up locking the topic properly, but then punish Person B too. Why? He used an image? If Person B had posted something like “<em>Face palm</em> Wrong section…”, nothing would’ve happened. The topic would’ve been locked, and Person B would’ve remained fine.</p>
<p>You see what happened there? Staff (I don’t know about all) treat images as worse than text, even if the image is representing something that could be expressed in words.</p>
<p>Oh, and I know AMERIKA’s case had to do with failing, but that’s beside the point. Look at the face palm situation.</p>
<p>Now some staff member might fight back saying “He broke rule number #, which states no flaming.” That would be correct, however, if they enforced that rule with <span class="bbcode-i">everyone</span> on the forum, there would probably be green, yellow, and maybe even blue dots everywhere you go.</p>
<p>They also might argue with “He’s been warned before, etc…” or “He knows better.”, and again, that’s also true. But like I said before, that’s not the case with most members. It’s not enforced.</p>
<p>Finally, their response could be “We don’t have time to chase every member around the forum.” If that’s the case, then don’t even bother tracking down specific members, because that’s unfair.</p>
<p>So my suggestion is either enforce the flaming rule or be specific with image flaming, or stop unfairly punishing members.</p>
<p>Wait, they’re likely to fight back with that too, with something like “We’re not unfairly punishing members, because they deserved it.” That’s right, but also wrong at the same time. Sure, they might have deserved it, but it’s unfair because you’re letting other members get away with what another got punished for.</p>
<p>Oh, and last but not least, this isn’t a suggestion topic. Just a point of view, and I guess a little rant, I want others to discuss.</p>
<p>That’s all,</p>
<p>~Lin</p>
