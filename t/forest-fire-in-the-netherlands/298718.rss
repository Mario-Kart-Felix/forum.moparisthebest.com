    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The Hague - About 550 people, many of them pensioners or guests at a luxury hotel, were evacuated Friday after a forest fire in Schoorl in northwestern Netherlands, local officials said as the fire was brought under control around midnight.

The local mayor&#39;s office said access to the stricken area remained forbidden and the people who had been evacuated as a precautionary measure would have to spend the night in shelters or with relatives and friends.

The fire accompanied by thick smoke progressed through an area of dunes, scrubland and forests to threaten the village of Schoorl, which has about 2,800 residents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
