    <title>Thoughts on Current rsps bases</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thoughts-on-current-rsps-bases/520678</link>
    <description>So recently ive been comparing the code to many different sources that are currently out there. I keep asking myself [b]What is the best/Stable source?[/b]
Some people say [b]Hyperion[/b] is the best while others say [b]RuneSource[/b] is the best. Now I know alot of people that prefer using [b]Shards[/b]. So I am asking the community What they think the best source is.

In my opinion I would go with Runesource or Hyperion. Mainly because Graham Designed Hyperion and i got to know him as a friend not just as a programmer. Then I would probably do Runesource because again I have discussed many things with blake before and we grew a friendship before he deleted all his accounts on the communities.

So take the time now and comment below on your personal Opinion on the mentioned sources or name another one that was not mentioned.</description>

<p>where in that do i make a single reference to my server development?</p>
<blockquote>Personal choice man. You may say Hyperion is complicated. I say no as I can develop things on Hyperion 10x faster than on PI. And I used to be a PI noob!</blockquote>
<p>yea thats true, i dont got much experience with hyperion but just upon first glance it confused me, but yea its based on opinion what ever your more comfortable with</p>

Anything but project insanity<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I know most people say pi’s are shit but they are so simple and there is so many tutorials (for new people who need help) and things you can do with them. yea sure they aren’t the best but the uniqueness that you can add into them is what i like. as for hyperion and so on its just so complicated i’d rather just say screw it and go with the simple stuff and its good for learning basic things.[/quote]<br>
Personal choice man. You may say Hyperion is complicated. I say no as I can develop things on Hyperion 10x faster than on PI. And I used to be a PI noob!</p>

<p>I can, the project i am currently working on is a PI im taking out all jagexs armours except the basics bronze-rune and making my own thats boss armours and all, then we are also taking out all the bosses and making new more unique ones, then we are gunna have new dungeons and such, this is all with the help of amy_webb, poopler, our webdeveloper nic and myself. theres lots more as well, all new minigames, thats just the beginning, so yes there is lots you can do still, and yea your right it is a bit sloppy but atleast its easy access, and idk about unorgranized, i find it very easy to find everything throughout my source</p>

<p>I know most people say pi’s are shit but they are so simple and there is so many tutorials (for new people who need help) and things you can do with them. yea sure they aren’t the best but the uniqueness that you can add into them is what i like. as for hyperion and so on its just so complicated i’d rather just say screw it and go with the simple stuff and its good for learning basic things.</p>

<p>I agree. I see some things to do easier and harder in different bases.</p>
<p>Some things are overly-complicated (i.e. winterlove’s way of loading and saving players) and some things are pretty simple (i.e. navigating through Hyperion’s files). But Hyperion really wins my cookie. It has the least faults and more strengths imo.</p>

Apollo, Hyperion, Runesource, RS2HD, my favorite bases. Hyperion and RS2HD are my completely most favorite (they both really have the same design in terms of packaging use and file names/use, so they are really the same).</p>

              <p>So recently ive been comparing the code to many different sources that are currently out there. I keep asking myself <span class="bbcode-b">What is the best/Stable source?</span><br>
Some people say <span class="bbcode-b">Hyperion</span> is the best while others say <span class="bbcode-b">RuneSource</span> is the best. Now I know alot of people that prefer using <span class="bbcode-b">Shards</span>. So I am asking the community What they think the best source is.</p>
<p>In my opinion I would go with Runesource or Hyperion. Mainly because Graham Designed Hyperion and i got to know him as a friend not just as a programmer. Then I would probably do Runesource because again I have discussed many things with blake before and we grew a friendship before he deleted all his accounts on the communities.</p>
<p>So take the time now and comment below on your personal Opinion on the mentioned sources or name another one that was not mentioned.</p>
