<p>I can, the project i am currently working on is a PI im taking out all jagexs armours except the basics bronze-rune and making my own thats boss armours and all, then we are also taking out all the bosses and making new more unique ones, then we are gunna have new dungeons and such, this is all with the help of amy_webb, poopler, our webdeveloper nic and myself. theres lots more as well, all new minigames, thats just the beginning, so yes there is lots you can do still, and yea your right it is a bit sloppy but atleast its easy access, and idk about unorgranized, i find it very easy to find everything throughout my source<br>
[/quote]I really think as a bunch of uneducated (tertiary-wise) teenagers you will produce content that is way better than Jagex’s stupid computer science majors’ and software engineers’. I can’t way to play!</p>
<p>i totally agree, but jagex has improved within the past few months with the new content as in changing the look of all the basic models to make them all unique, but yea all the jagex computer science people and all are older and have lost their creativeness so they are losing that since of adventure thats the biggest reason why i quit runescape because i feel like the adventure was gone, and i feel they are slowing moving towards not caring about the players but just the players money (soloman store thing). but i cant blame em they have to make money some how, although  they make a shit load from memberships.[/quote]</p>

Anything but project insanity<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I know most people say pi’s are shit but they are so simple and there is so many tutorials (for new people who need help) and things you can do with them. yea sure they aren’t the best but the uniqueness that you can add into them is what i like. as for hyperion and so on its just so complicated i’d rather just say screw it and go with the simple stuff and its good for learning basic things.[/quote]<br>
Personal choice man. You may say Hyperion is complicated. I say no as I can develop things on Hyperion 10x faster than on PI. And I used to be a PI noob!</p>
