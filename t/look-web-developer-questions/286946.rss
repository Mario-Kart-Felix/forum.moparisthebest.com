    <title>LOOK: Web Developer Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/look-web-developer-questions/286946</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not the person to ask questions around here as I use google a lot for my resources, but this one I cannot find. I have never seen anyone yet to mention great sites that they have [b]subscribed[/b] to, like: [url=http://dzineblog.com/][b]Dzine Blog[/b][/url], [url=http://www.grafpedia.com/]Graf Pedia[/url], [url=http://psdvibe.com/][b]PSD Vibe[/b][/url], [url=http://hv-designs.co.uk/][b]HV Designs[/b][/url], [url=http://www.tutorial9.net/]Tutorial 9[/url], [url=http://www.pvmgarage.com/]PVM Garage[/url], etc. 

Have you subscribed to a Web Profession&#39;s Blog before/already? If so, what was/is the name of it and what all do you remember that you have learned from it?

Over here I have learned many things for someone who strives a lot :p. I learned to use GIMP better obviously though, there are some basic things which I never knew of until a few days ago that actually decreased my works elapsed time :cool:. I&#39;m hoping to see some of you guys have subscribed to those/these awesome sites out there :D though. My reason for saying this is because these guys actually post good information, they don&#39;t just post tutorials and codes, but they also give tips and resources that ease or/and increase your capabilities.</description>

<p>I just practice, practice, practice, and look at other sites that amuse me and see why it amuses me. And of course build up on technique.</p>

              <p>I don’t subscribe to webblogs, I bookmark some and I’ll check on them occasionally. But no, I don’t spend every waking moment watching my RSS feed on an update. As for who I subscribe too, it’s mainly just advertisement designers, or guys in graphic design. Only the ones that are ‘in the biz’.</p>
<p>There are many guys out there that do some of the most well known work, but no one ever sees the artist behind it. There’s a whole world of Graphic Designers that have websites, but aren’t mainstream, you have too look for them. I go to those guys for inspiration in what I do.</p>
