    <description>The game loads fine and I can click things but I can&#39;t type anything. 

I&#39;ve tried chrome, mozilla, and internet explorer, same with all of them. I cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled java, along with the JRE. Also restarted the computer and the web browsers with no success. 
I have no idea what else to try, any suggestions?</description>
