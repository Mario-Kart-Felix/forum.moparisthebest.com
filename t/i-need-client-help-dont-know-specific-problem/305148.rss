    <title>I need Client help (dont know specific problem)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-client-help-dont-know-specific-problem/305148</link>
    <description>Okay, I have a No-ip.biz  IP for my server. and i have a client and source, that im pretty sure work. ( if you know of any that you know do work , please reply with link ). so i go onto my source and &quot;compile&quot;. Then while sitll on my source i &quot;Run&quot;. then i go onto client and &quot;Run&quot; it. ok, now some clients work and some dont. some say a whole lot of stuff about &quot;Unkown Sources&quot; . for example, &quot;Java.net.URLClassLoader$1.run &lt;Unknown Source&gt;&quot; and there a few more like that.   What Am I Doin wrong?

My second problem is, one time i got a source compiled and ran a client. then i got my friend to download the client. When he clicked &quot;log In&quot; it said &quot;Error in Connection&quot;. How can i fix this, do i have to connect my No-Ip.biz address to the client somehow?</description>

              <p>Well, some sources do not work.</p>
<p>I suggest using a pre made source.</p>
<p>I’m sure you can find some on here.</p>
