    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-with-my-client-not-loading/296805</link>
    <description>Alright ignore the cant read this errors, the top one is the issue. When i load the client, it works good. Then i try to log onto it and i get that big error. It&#39;s not anything to do with my codeing cause  i had the same issue with one of the deltascape clients i downloaded that i didnt even edit what so ever. So it must be with my computer, can any one tell me the issue?
