    <title>Error with my client not loading?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-with-my-client-not-loading/296806</link>
    <description>Alright ignore the cant read this errors, the top one is the issue. When i load the client, it works good. Then i try to log onto it and i get that big error. It&#39;s not anything to do with my codeing cause  i had the same issue with one of the deltascape clients i downloaded that i didnt even edit what so ever. So it must be with my computer, can any one tell me the issue?

(sorry for posting here, i need this issue resolved tho)

              <p>It threw an Exception when attempting to Initialize the ‘Platform’ class within the path com.sun.media.sound.<br>
It was probably caused because you might have an older version of Java installed, or maybe because it’s attempting to start music upon initialization of the client, and there are no music files to be found.</p>

              <p>I would say it has to do something with your java…<br>
try right clicking on run server and find there java type and switch it to yours…<br>
so lets say they had jdk1.6.0_01<br>
you would replace that with jdk1.6.0_14 if you have jdk 6 update 14…</p>
