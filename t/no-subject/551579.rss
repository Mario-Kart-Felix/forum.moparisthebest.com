    <description>Live your life forever dreaming
Live your life forever believing
You can make it someway
And it&#39;s a hard game to play
It&#39;s the road your heart is choosing
You can make it work out

Time is change of season for you
And giving you the reason you need
To hold on forever
Keep yourself together
Keeping it all together
When you fly high into the light

Take it straight to the top
And hold on
And keep on believing
Keep yourself believing

Live to win, sometimes you lose
Realize it&#39;s all up to you
Life is but a series of games
You hold on forever
Keeping it all together
When you fly high into the light

Take it straight to the top
And hold on
And keep on believing
Keep yourself believing

Take it straight to the top
And hold on
And keep on believing
Keep yourself believing

Take it straight to the top
And hold on
And keep on believing
Keep yourself believing

Take it straight to the top
And hold on, and hold on

Take it straight to the top
And hold on, and hold on
Keep on believing

Same Love Lyrics<br>
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis<br>
Ft: Macklemore &amp; Mary Lambert<br>
Produced By: Ryan Lewis<br>

<p>[Piano Intro]</p>
<p>[Verse 1: Macklemore]<br>
When I was in the 3rd grade<br>
I thought that I was gay<br>
Cause I could draw, my uncle was<br>
And I kept my room straight<br>
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face<br>
She’s like, "Ben, you’ve loved girls since before Pre-K!"<br>
Tripping, yeah, I guess she had a point, didn’t she?<br>
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head<br>
I remember doing the math, like<br>
"Yeah, I’m good at little league"<br>
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant<br>
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics<br>
The right-wing conservatives think it’s a decision<br>
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion<br>
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition, playing God<br>
Ahh, nah, here we go<br>
America the brave still fears what we don’t know<br>
And “God loves all his children” is somehow forgotten<br>
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago<br>
I don’t know</p>
<p>[Hook: Mary Lambert]<br>
And I can’t change<br>
Even if I tried<br>
Even if I wanted to<br>
And I can’t change<br>
Even if I tried<br>
Even if I wanted to<br>
My love, my love, my love<br>
She keeps me warm [x4]</p>
<p>[Verse 2: Macklemore]<br>
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me<br>
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?<br>
“Man, that’s gay” gets dropped on the daily<br>
We’ve become so numb to what we’re saying<br>
Our culture founded from oppression<br>
Yet we don’t have acceptance for 'em<br>
Call each other faggots<br>
Behind the keys of a message board<br>
A word rooted in hate<br>
Yet our genre still ignores it<br>
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser<br>
It’s the same hate that’s caused wars from religion<br>
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment<br>
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins<br>
It’s human rights for everybody, there is no difference<br>
Live on! And be yourself!<br>
When I was in church they taught me something else<br>
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren’t anointed<br>
That Holy Water that you soak in has been poisoned<br>
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless<br>
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen<br>
I might not be the same but that’s not important<br>
No freedom til we’re equal<br>
Damn right I support it</p>
<p>[Trombone Interlude]<br>
I don’t know</p>
<p>[Hook]</p>
<p>[Verse 3: Macklemore]<br>
We press play, don’t press pause<br>
Progress, march on!<br>
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause<br>
’Til the day that my uncles can be united by law<br>
Kids are walking around the hallway<br>
Plagued by pain in their heart<br>
A world so hateful<br>
Some would rather die<br>
Than be who they are<br>
And a certificate on paper<br>
Isn’t gonna solve it all<br>
But it’s a damn good place to start<br>
No law’s gonna change us<br>
We have to change us<br>
Whatever god you believe in<br>
We come from the same one<br>
Strip away the fear, underneath, it’s all the same love<br>
About time that we raised up!</p>
<p>[Hook]</p>
<p>[Outro: Mary Lambert]<br>
Love is patient, love is kind<br>
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)<br>
Description 10 Contributors<br>
?</p>
<p>“Same Love” is a song from Macklemore’s album The Heist which has played a big part in making the issue of gay and lesbian equality more understandable to mainstream audiences.</p>
<p>He defends homosexuality, a rarity in hip-hop, though it should be noted that this was not the first song by a big name in hip-hop to speak on gay struggle, coming after Murs’ “Animal Style.”</p>
<p>As hip hop scholar and educator Amil Cook writes:</p>
<p>In 2013, Angel Haze, who identifies as pansexual, freestyled over the beat, addressing their own experiences as someone whose sexuality does not conform to society’s norms.</p>
<p>Michael<br>
7 months</p>
<p>For context it might be worth noting that the song came out during the R74 campaign in Washington state. See eg. Macklemore ‘Same Love’: Hip-Hop Artist Releases Pro-Gay Single For Marriage Equality I recall a KEXP interview with Mary Lambert where she mentions the campaign in reference to the song.<br>

Everybody wants a thrill<br>
Payin’ anything to roll the dice<br>

              <p>Live your life forever dreaming<br>
Live your life forever believing<br>
You can make it someway<br>
And it’s a hard game to play<br>
It’s the road your heart is choosing<br>
You can make it work out</p>
<p>Time is change of season for you<br>
And giving you the reason you need<br>
To hold on forever<br>
Keep yourself together<br>
Keeping it all together<br>
When you fly high into the light</p>
<p>Take it straight to the top<br>
And hold on<br>
And keep on believing<br>
Keep yourself believing</p>
<p>Live to win, sometimes you lose<br>
Realize it’s all up to you<br>
Life is but a series of games<br>
You hold on forever<br>
Keeping it all together<br>
When you fly high into the light</p>
<p>Take it straight to the top<br>
And hold on<br>
And keep on believing<br>
Keep yourself believing</p>
<p>Take it straight to the top<br>
And hold on<br>
And keep on believing<br>
Keep yourself believing</p>
<p>Take it straight to the top<br>
And hold on<br>
And keep on believing<br>
Keep yourself believing</p>
<p>Take it straight to the top<br>
And hold on, and hold on</p>
<p>Take it straight to the top<br>
And hold on, and hold on<br>
Keep on believing</p>
