    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-anti-auto-clicker-made-this-thinking-of-stalls/541444</link>
    <description>Add this in Player.java
[code=java]	/**
	 * How many the player has clicked the second option of an object
	 */
	public int sOCPacketClicks;
	
	/**
	 * A flag to see if the process of reset the packet 132 clicks has started
	 */
	public boolean isRefreshingClicks = false;
	
	
	
	
	
	
	[/code]
Then this in second click object packet
[code=java]AntiAutoClicker.addClicks(c);[/code]

and add this class:
[code=java]package server.util;

import server.event.Event;
import server.event.EventContainer;
import server.event.EventManager;
import server.model.players.Client;

/**

public class AntiAutoClicker {

	/**
	 * The maximum click per minute a player should do, because stalls are
	 * re-stashed every 3 seconds, so 60/3 = 20, and that is not likely to happen
	 * because i doubt any player is that good.
	 */
	public static final int MAXIMUM_CLICKS_PER_MINUTE = 20;
	
	/**
	 * The wait time until the clicks are refreshed are 60k milliseconds
	 */
	public static final int RESET_TIME = 60000;
	
	/**
	 * 
	 * @param player
	 * 		the player that will have its clicks added
	 */
	public static void addClicks(Client player) {
		
		/**
		 * Every time the player clicks the second option of an object
		 * that variable is increased
		 */
		player.sOCPacketClicks ++;
		
		player.sendMessage(&quot;&quot;+player.sOCPacketClicks+&quot;&quot;);
		/**
		 * If the player has the same amount or more than the maximum amount of clicks
		 * per minute continue
		 */
		if(player.sOCPacketClicks &gt; MAXIMUM_CLICKS_PER_MINUTE) {
			
			/*
			 * The player is walked away from where he is to stop his power skilling
			 * or whatever he is spamming.

			refreshClicks(player);
		}
	}
	
	/**
	 * if the player has gotten to the maximum number of clicks avaible
	 * the player will walk back three steps
	 * 
	 * @param player

	public static void movePlayer(final Client player) {
		
		/**

		 */
		player.getPA().walkTo(-3, 0);
	}
	
	/**
	 * After one of the first click the clicks will be reseted
	 *

	 */
	public static void refreshClicks(final Client player) {

				c.stop();
			}
			}, RESET_TIME);
	}
}
[/code]


So how a normal stall works is that when you steal from it the items disappear from it and the stall is restashed in 3 seconds, so it would mean 20 clicks in 1 minute to get all the items from the stall.

What this does is that if you click it more than 20 times in one minute it will walk you back.
So it combats AutoClicker and massclicking

*Note
sOCPacketClicks stands for secondObjectClickPacket</description>

<p>EDIT: Also another thing you have to fix is that the person doesn’t go in one direction everytime. Reason… Someone can click something that has a low timer and can clip into objects.</p>

Shouldn’t you record the amount of clicks within a certain interval? Maybe a mass amount of clicks inside of a certain area.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Then the person will slow down the auto clicker and if he keeps editing the anti auto clicker script then normal people will get affected because you click a lot of you havent noticed.[/quote]<br>
That is very true. Amount of clicks would hurt most normal players rather than ACs.(their not really bots…) The best way to counter Autoclickers would be through a random event of some sort. It doesn’t have to be a “real” one, it can be made up by you as well. Even if it is "type this command ::ul <span class="hashtag">#rand</span>#"<br>
or something like “what is the first item in your inventory?”<br>
::itis Coins<br>
Make it a mini quiz show with random questions <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>I have one on my Mac that basically records position on screen, what type of click / key to press, so I can basically write scripts for anything. not to mention I could have just used applescript to make a simple macro.</p>
<p>again, stop worrying about the way macros are done. and just add randoms and shit.</p>

I had an auto clicker that supported key commands and shit. Once I set it up like to mine Pure Ess for me on runescape. I was able to key in to hit the d pad so the mouse could hit the bank and everything… So I mean, the tech is out there, and it ain’t hard to come by.</p>
