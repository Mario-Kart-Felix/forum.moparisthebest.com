    <title>Wtf is wrong with my mouse?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-is-wrong-with-my-mouse/160006</link>
    <description>Everytime i want to open something, or go to a webpage it doesn&#39;t click! Like if i wanted to open up a folder in my hard drive, sometimes you would just have to click it twice(Normal way) but sometimes i hv to click it like 6 to 7 times for it to open, its not slowness of the computer. Just the mouse, i don&#39;t think it could be dirty inside, because that only affects the movement of the mouse on the window, not the actual clicking? I downloaded updates, patches for the mouse, still no luck? Anyone got anything in mind to fix it?</description>

              <p>Didn’t help. In Halo i still shoot super slow with the pistol, and i’m clicking super fast, and as for folder stuff, when i highlight it doesn’t highlight, folder won’t open, etc.</p>

              <p>If i click softer, it doesn’t even open up lol. I just tried with the start button, i just clicked it 5 times, still won’t open(softly). Clicking it hard, actually makes it open, but most of the time it doesn’t, its better than soft clicking though.</p>

              <p>If the other mouse only had sensitivity issues, which is obviously down to the DPI and what you are used too. So clicking was fine then it’s probably just that mouse? (Maybe clicking too hard? xD)</p>
