    <title>Learning multiple programming languages at once</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/learning-multiple-programming-languages-at-once/460534</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I just recently got into programming with java and it&#39;s been going pretty well lately.  I&#39;m about a third of the way through my first book and I am planning on getting more advanced books as I learn more and more.  SO, as of late, I&#39;ve been getting interested in web development/designing.  I am debating if I should buy a coupe of books on web design/development and learn it together along with java or, should I finish my book on java and then go to web design and then back to java again etc.  I don&#39;t have too much spare time lately because of homework and extracurricular activities but, whenever I get the chance I practice with java.  Will it be harder for me to continue to learn java at the same time as html, php, css, mysql etc. or, will it not have any effect on my progress with Java?</description>

              <p>HTML and CSS takes around a day or two to come to grips with, I don’t see why everyone sees them as impossible. They’re not even classed as languages imo.</p>
<p>PHP to it’s fullest extent will take longer as it is the most widely used scripting language in the world, it takes quite a while to learn properly. SQL comes hand in hand with PHP, or at least it did with me. If you learn PHP it’s essential to know SQL if you wish to make any form of project.</p>

              <p>Thanks a lot for the feedback guys.  In the end I decided to continue my progress only with Java, for the time being.  However, once I become fluent with Java, I will definitely hop on to web development and start with HTML and then continue my way up to PHP.</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, it’s much harder to learn multiple languages at once. When you’re learning the syntax of one language, you’ll just make it harder for yourself in my opinion. Stick with learning, and becoming fluent in Java. Java is a good language to start because it’s such a highly OOP orientated languages, and teaches you the basics of OOP/etc, and you will then apply that to other languages.</p>
