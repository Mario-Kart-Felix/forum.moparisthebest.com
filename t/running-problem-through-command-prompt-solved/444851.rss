So as soon as I run my server it&#39;ll be all like running and blah blah then it will say online. But then as soon as it says that all those Fatal errors will occur. I tried reverting all my stuff back but it&#39;s still doing that. I think it happened after I clicked save on my quest tab to save  my account. Does anyone know what to do?</description>

              <p>Some of those coordinates are at the slayer tower in canafis if that helps?</p>
