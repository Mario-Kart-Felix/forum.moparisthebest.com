    <title>Ivman not found?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ivman-not-found/267436</link>
    <description>[s]I installed Arch with fluxbox, and now when I browse with FireFox it the fonts look of bad quality. Like when you zoom out with ctrl + mouse wheel. On Windows they kind of look like vector images, you know, with smooth edges. But on my Arch they don&#39;t. How do I fix this?

And a second question: Some pages, including www.moparisthebest.com, are filled with chinese signs instead of normal characters. Something similar happens to openoffice, where everything is filled with [][][][] instead of normal letters. After I start up openoffice, it crashes within a minute.[/s]

Edit: I think I&#39;ll make this thread continuos one. I&#39;ll edit the first post when I have a new question, or when I fixed my problem, as you can already see. Unless you guys think I shouldn&#39;t, then I&#39;ll make a new thread everytime I run into a new problem.

Edit 2: I have an external hdd connected to my laptop via usb. For some reason it isn&#39;t detected, so I read somewhere that I had to install ivman. So I did. But when I try to run it, it doesn&#39;t recognize it. But when I do &#39;man ivman&#39; I do get a manual page. What the hell am I doing wrong?</description>
