You can always get into contact with the VPS host to ask them if the port is being blocked by something on their end. I’m not your provider, so I can only do so much.[/quote]</p>
<p>The VPS im using is a basic one for now which doesnt offer technical support but the port isnt being blocked by them, any other ideas mate, add me on skype - daannnp</p>

canyouseeme will say success when your server is online and broadcasting on port 43594, assuming you told it to look on port 43594.<br>
That service only checks if there is something broadcasting… So if you did not have the server on and you checked the port, it will always say it failed.<br>
Make sure the firewall on the VPS is allowing connections to go through, both inbound and outbound.[/quote]</p>
<p>Firewall is disabled on the vps so it shouldn’t matter should it ? And I’ve got it allowed inbound but not outbound is that the problem ? And port 43594 says its not open on canyouseeme , I don’t know the problem ?</p>
