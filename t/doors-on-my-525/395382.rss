    <title>DOORS on my 525</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/doors-on-my-525/395382</link>
    <description>Hello, I am using a 525 source and its Hybrid PVP.
I am wanting to move my servers home and I used doors.cfg to try to get into my new home.
I need the Camelot Castle Gate to open for me and here is the code, and if that doesnt work.. how can i delete the doors? code under doors.cfg:
//door = 2757	3482	0	-2	1
//door = 2758	3482	0	-2	1
[ENDOFDOORLIST]
The doors are facing south, it is the gate that is used for the Castle in Camelot.
Thank you! :)</description>
