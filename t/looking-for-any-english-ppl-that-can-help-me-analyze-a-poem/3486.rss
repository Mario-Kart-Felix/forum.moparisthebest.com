    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-any-english-ppl-that-can-help-me-analyze-a-poem/3486</link>
    <description>Hi, im exams are coming up and ive been pushed to the limit. Ive had no time whats so ever to prepare an oral presentation on one of Ted Hughes poems that I have to do and im desprate for help. Its called warm and cold and is writen (as i said) buy ted hughes. Heres a link to it http://www.poemhunter.com/p/m/poem.asp?poet=6616&amp;poem=29462

If anyone whos good at poetry could have a look at that and give me a few words of advise as to what its about, id much appreciate it. One thing to note, Ted Hughes almost always draws a metaphor between human behavour and nature showing how nature is superior, Its this im looking for. Thank you in advance anyone able to help.[br][size=1]Posted at: May 31, 2006, 03:43:27 am[/size][hr]this is an urgent bump. if anyone can help, plz do. Common english buffs.</description>
