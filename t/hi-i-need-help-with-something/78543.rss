    <title>Hi,I need help with something</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hi-i-need-help-with-something/78543</link>
    <description>Ok, the title says all.
Well, Me and chaz are trying to make hyphyscape V.2.
But, I&#39;m trying to make different starting point.But, I don&#39;t have the cords.
I would like to know if someone can get me a guide to cords or tell me the cords.
Of Ape Toll or Entrana.
Plus I would also like suggestions if you think i should make the starting and main place somewhere else.
Thank You,
Jon

              <p>well, i cant give ya em, but i coudl give u a way to get em? run the server and go to entrana/ape atoll, and either use the command ::coordon or go to ur running bar and u should have ur x,y coordinate. Now go to the place were ur character starts out, and get the x,y for that. Now search that coordinate in client.java, and replace it witht eh one u got from ape atoll/entrana. I recommend bakin up ur client.java b4 doing this, caz i mite be wrong  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
