    <title>Restarter problem?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/restarter-problem/295821</link>
    <description>Ok I have no idea why this is happening. It restarts for hours fine, but every now and then I notice it restarts and no one can connect. I&#39;ve re opened the auto restart 5 times and turned it back on and still no one can connect.

EDIT: Could it be because I was doing something at the time of the reset? -Nvm happened when I wasn&#39;t doing anything.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 17, 2009, 04:42:52 pm[/size][hr]anyone?</description>
