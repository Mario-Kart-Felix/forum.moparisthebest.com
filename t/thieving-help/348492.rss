    <description>Hello, I am not interested in using Scar to auto RuneScape but as to using Scar to auto private servers to start learning Scar. Although I am having a bit of trouble, I want to Script a Scar Script that thieves from a Stall, and when it detects a color from the log in screen it goes to coord x,y and clicks it to log in until the color is gone. The Stall looks like this along with the log in screen.

I really do not know much about scar so I am looking for some help with this but I don&#39;t want you to code it for me, I want to learn.

If you think you can help me code scar my msn is: slim-shorty@live.com or just comment below</description>
