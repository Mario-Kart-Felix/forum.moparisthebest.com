    <title>Webclient Error On Website?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-error-on-website/523680</link>
    <description>Well I made the server jar then uploaded to dropbox then used the code for the webclient

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Place Title Here&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;applet code=&quot;client.class&quot; archive=&quot;Place uploaded file here&quot; width=&quot;765px&quot; height=&quot;503px&quot;&gt;
Java is not installed on your machine or your browser does not allowed Java Applet to run&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the latest Java technology at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.java.com/&quot;&gt;http://www.java.com/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

I used this then changed the title of the client to mine then i put the file link where it says place uploaded file here then when i saved that and go to the webclient and click run it comes with an error and says error. click for details i click that and it says ClassNotFoundException under says client.class. Idk what I did wrong can some1 explain this and what I should do to fix it thanks</description>

              <p>If the client.class file is in a package you need to include it. If the client.class is within the package package you would put code=“package.client.class” Also remember to reference your code from the right spot: just outside the package or if there is no package in the same directory as your client.class file is in. If your html document isn’t in the right location you can use the codebase attribute in your html code. I hoped I helped!</p>
