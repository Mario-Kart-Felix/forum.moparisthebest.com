[center]Don&#39;t post bad comments, because this is my first topic, and I never saw a tut on this.[/center]

[center]This is actually fairly easy.[/center]
[center]Open your source folder and click on &quot;player.java&quot;[/center]
[center]Then Search this: // Giving the player an unique look[/center]
[center]You will see a code similar to this:[/center]
[center][code=cpp]// Giving the player an unique look
		playerEquipment[playerHat] = 6858;
		playerEquipment[playerCape] = 14095;
		playerEquipment[playerAmulet] = 6585;
		playerEquipment[playerChest] = 14538;
		playerEquipment[playerShield] = 6889;
		playerEquipment[playerLegs] = 2497;
		playerEquipment[playerHands] = 7462;
		playerEquipment[playerFeet] = 15350;
		playerEquipment[playerRing] = 6735;
		playerEquipment[playerArrows] = -1;
		playerEquipment[playerWeapon] = 4151;[/code][/center]
