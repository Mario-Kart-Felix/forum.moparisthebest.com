[b]Desktop Destroy 2[/b]
-Info
Desktop Destroy Chicken Carnage is a game wherein you have to kill as much chickens as possible within a time limit. You can use several weapons and goodies to reach your goal. How more chickens you kill, how more points you get. How more original you kill them, how more points you get. 
Example: You can use your bloodtube on a chicken and then shoot it, to gain more points than just shooting it. But you also can use your bubblegun on a chicken, then use your bloodtube on the bubble and then flame it, and gain even more than more points! Be original and gain points, but also be quick and sadistic, that&#39;s where Destkop Destroy is all about. 

Where the hell is part one? It&#39;s gone. Hehe, that rhymes.

WinEye places a pair of cartoonish-looking eyes on your desktop that always look towards your mouse pointers current location. The eyes blink occasionally, complete with optional sound effects. You can drag and drop the program to place it where you prefer on your desktop. While WinEye is running, a system-tray icon appears with a right-click menu for access to the programs functions. You can adjust properties for blinking and sleeping, colors, size, sounds, and more. If you want to have access to the area of the screen behind WinEye it will be hidden automatically. If you have registered your copy, you&#39;ll get a code for switching off the reminder that appears after WinEye is started. The registration charges will be given to SOS Children&#39;s Villages organisation.

[b]Help Me II[/b]
Your Mac chokes out a plea for assistance, and writes the plea on the desktop, using folders to form the letters. Quite an effect, if we do say so ourselves... 

[tt][b]Installation:[/b][/tt]
This item is an extension, drag it onto a closed System Folder, and it will automatically be placed into the Extensions folder, where it belongs. When the computer is restarted, the extensions should take effect. In some cases there is a PowerPC version of the program, which you should use on any Mac with a PowerPC processor in it. Use the regular version for older 68k Macs. In cases where there is only one version, it will work on just about any Mac. Additional requirements are listed with the files. Note: If the computer&#39;s sound is turned all the way down, extensions that play sounds won&#39;t be noticeable. 

[tt][b]Removal:[/b][/tt]
Just remove it from the Extensions folder of your System folder, and restart your Mac. It is that simple!

-Info<br>
WinEye places a pair of cartoonish-looking eyes on your desktop that always look towards your mouse pointers current location. The eyes blink occasionally, complete with optional sound effects. You can drag and drop the program to place it where you prefer on your desktop. While WinEye is running, a system-tray icon appears with a right-click menu for access to the programs functions. You can adjust properties for blinking and sleeping, colors, size, sounds, and more. If you want to have access to the area of the screen behind WinEye it will be hidden automatically. If you have registered your copy, you’ll get a code for switching off the reminder that appears after WinEye is started. The registration charges will be given to SOS Children’s Villages organisation.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Help Me II</span><br>
Your Mac chokes out a plea for assistance, and writes the plea on the desktop, using folders to form the letters. Quite an effect, if we do say so ourselves…</p>
<p>[tt]<span class="bbcode-b">Installation:</span>[/tt]<br>
This item is an extension, drag it onto a closed System Folder, and it will automatically be placed into the Extensions folder, where it belongs. When the computer is restarted, the extensions should take effect. In some cases there is a PowerPC version of the program, which you should use on any Mac with a PowerPC processor in it. Use the regular version for older 68k Macs. In cases where there is only one version, it will work on just about any Mac. Additional requirements are listed with the files. Note: If the computer’s sound is turned all the way down, extensions that play sounds won’t be noticeable.</p>
<p>[tt]<span class="bbcode-b">Removal:</span>[/tt]<br>
Just remove it from the Extensions folder of your System folder, and restart your Mac. It is that simple!<br>
