Hello, welcome to Varrock. This is a new village that I made and plan to continue it&#39;s development every day. This village will continuously expand, if you wish to live here, please contact me via PM on here or contact me on that chat ingame.

Information on citizenship[/b] -
You hereby pledge by becoming a citizen of Varrock that you will work under the rules of the Moparscape official server rules found [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,471687.0.html]here[/url]. You pledge that you will work to continue the development of this village and eventually into a city and any disobedience can and may result in expulsion from the city indefinitely. You will be aware that any chest made inside the city is owned by Corey and may only be password protected (please, please make it different than your username) and will inform Corey of the password that is set on this chest, any disobedience will result in expulsion from the city indefinitely. You will be aware that any material needed to continue the development of the city (coal, iron, cobblestone, wood mainly) will be taxed from your chests (roughly 1-10%) as needed. You will be an honorable citizen and the finding of any griefer within the city will be reported, regardless of relationship. If notification of conspiracy is made aware, you will find yourself and the griefer expelled from the city and the staff of the server will decide your punishments. You will not live in the city for free and must not be soliciting. Should you eventually run out of materials to be taxed due to solicitation, you will be given a 7 day notice to obtain materials for the next tax collection. Failure to do so will result in your removal from the village.

Areas 
[b]
First House of Varrock[/b]
[IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/2z8dfnr.png[/img]
This was the shelter Corey used to begin the city. This was his only use of defense from the elements of darkness. This contains his first chest, first furnace, and first workbench.

[b]Blue Moon Inn [Bar and Apartments][/b]
[IMG]http://i53.tinypic.com/9zoxw8.png[/img]

The second structure to be built in Varrock. This facility will come with pre-built chests by Corey. Each citizen will be given 1 starting chest with their own password locked by Corey. You will be able to upgrade your chests into a small vault under your chest with the following guidelines.

[ul][li]Small Chest - 9 Wooden Planks[/li]
[li]Large Chest - 18 Wooden Planks[/li][/ul]

Notice that you will be taxed 1 wooden plank to create the chest, but is essentially worth the extra plank.

[b]Guardhouse[/b]

Currently, the only wheat farm in the city. Will provide moderate food when tended to correctly.

[b]Mine shaft[/b]
[IMG]http://i54.tinypic.com/ibmet0.png[/img]
This is the city mineshaft. You will create your own mining networks within this shaft. You are not allowed to mine upwards until you&#39;ve walked 25 paces (squares) into the mineshaft. Any materials you find in here are yours. You will be taxed 1-10% materials from your chests at the end of every week (Sunday).

[b]Rules on buying a home[/b]
If you wish to buy a home, follow these rules please;
If you find an abandoned home or a prebuilt home anywhere within Varrock, please check for signs of who owns that facility or who is selling that facility.
For building a home, the plot you build on is free, but space is limited, if I find the house taking up too much space (usually on the surface), I may downsize it a little.
Current home sellers are (an usually named via signpost):
Corey
Mopar_x

[b]Current rules on expanding homes[/b]
Due to limited space, you are only allowed to build upwards 3 stories within your home. Each story consists of the floor (blocks below you, 3 blocks up, then the roof (blocks above you) which results in 5 total blocks per story.


[b]Expanding outside the walls rules[/b]
If you wish to expand outside the walls, you must follow these rules.
1) Your area must be connected to the main city via wall. So it is recommended to keep it symmetrical (keeping it square/in line with the outside wall)
2) Your area MUST be surrounded by wall. The general rule for creating the wall is making it 4 cobblestone wide and at least 3 blocks higher than the ground below it.
3) Each corner of the wall that is added must have a watch tower that is 4x6x4 (lengthxheightxdepth) with 1x2 (lengthxheight) blocks on the corners
4) You must remove the section of the current wall after you finish construction and create a road from the main city to that section
5) Expansion is only allowed if it is near Varrock, the expansion cannot be far away because the wall materials needed to create a wall that far is massive and likely impossible to complete.


Topic still under construction...
