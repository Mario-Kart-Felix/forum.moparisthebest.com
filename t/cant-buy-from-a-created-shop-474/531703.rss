    <title>Can&#39;t buy from a created shop (474)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-buy-from-a-created-shop-474/531703</link>
    <description>So I have succesfully made a shop and added items but when I try to buy something, nothing happends. I don&#39;t get anything or no message. I can buy from shopkeepers/shopassistans with the id of 520-527 but thoose shops are the only shops I can buy from.

Is there anything I can do so I can buy from other shops?</description>
