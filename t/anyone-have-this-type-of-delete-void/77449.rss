    <title>Anyone have this type of Delete Void?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-this-type-of-delete-void/77449</link>
    <description>What type of void I&#39;m talking about if when you click on an object or something it deletes a certain object, 
IE if you clicked on a door it would delete it. Everytime I try what I made I d/c..
And no, it&#39;s not Fedexer&#39;s delete object&#39;s release you have to specify the coords with that. With mine you are spawning the object with an item and you can delete your object.</description>
