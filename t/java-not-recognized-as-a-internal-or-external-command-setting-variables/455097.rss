    <description>[b]Description[/b]: Fixing Java is not recognized as a internal or external command.

[b]Difficulty[/b]: Easy

[b]Assumed Knowledge[/b]: Reading, looking at pictures, downloading

Well I&#39;m making this tutorial because it seems a lot of people don&#39;t know how to locate their java paths. When they run their source or compile.

[b]Step One[/b]: Downloading Java

You always want to have the most up to date Java. I recommend installing the updated Java Runtime which can be downloaded here: [url=http://www.java.com]www.java.com[/url] and the updated Java SE Development Kit (JDK) Cobundles which can be downloaded here:[url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[/url] (What I have circled green is the Development Kit that you should download if it updates just get the new one.) It might ask you to install J unit choose the option not to install it. You can uninstall Netbeans after its done installing everything.

[b]Step Two[/b]: Knowing what Java you have

Go to start

Click on My Computer

Local Disk (C:)

Program Files Folder or Program Files (x86) Folder

Java Folder

there you are...


[b]Step Three[/b]: Setting up Environmental Variables

Click the Start Button

Hover(aka position) your mouse on My Computer and right click it then choose properties. 

Next choose Advanced system settings you should get something like this:

Click on Environmental Variables...

Make a new... one where it says User variables for (YOUR LOGIN USER)

Variable Name: CLASSPATH
Variable Value: C:\Program Files\Java\VERSION OF JAVA YOU DOWNLOADED\bin;%CLASSPATH%;
or 
Variable Value: C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\VERSION OF JAVA YOU DOWNLOADED\bin;%CLASSPATH%;

[b]^If your java downloaded in the Program Files (x86) Folder[/b]

Make a new one under the same thing but this time its going to be

Variable Name: PATH
Variable Value: C:\Program Files\Java\VERSION OF JAVA YOU DOWNLOADED\bin;
or
Variable Value: C:\Program Files\Java\VERSION OF JAVA YOU DOWNLOADED\bin;

[b]^If your java downloaded in the Program Files (x86) Folder[/b]

Make sure that you set it to your version of what you downloaded

If you are still having trouble take a look at this picture:

[b]Step Four[/b]: Locating Java in Source &amp; Client Run.bat, Compiler.bat

Right click on your run/compiler in Source Folder &amp; Client Folder and choose edit

you should get a code like this or similar:

(EXAMPLE)
[code]@echo off
title Server
java -Xmx800m -cp bin;deps/poi.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar;deps/jython.jar;log4j-1.2.15.jar; server.Server
start Run-Server.bat
pause[/code]

If your run &amp; compiler works after setting up your environmental GREAT! If not continue...


What I have in purple text is what you need to change it to

@echo off
title Server
&quot;C:/Program Files/java/VERSION OF JDK YOU DOWNLOADED/bin/java.exe&quot; -Xmx800m -cp bin;deps/poi.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar;deps/jython.jar;log4j-1.2.15.jar; server.Server
start Run-Server.bat
pause

You basically get it I hope! same thing with Program Files (x86)

@echo off
title Server
&quot;C:/Program Files (x86)/java/VERSION OF JAVA YOU DOWNLOADED/bin/java.exe&quot;-Xmx800m -cp bin;deps/poi.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar;deps/jython.jar;log4j-1.2.15.jar; server.Server
start Run-Server.bat
pause


Well I hope that this tutorial has helped you fix your problem. Please leave some feed back if you wish. Good luck.  :D</description>
