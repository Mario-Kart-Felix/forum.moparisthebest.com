    <title>Problems with Starting my server up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-starting-my-server-up/328105</link>
    <description>Ok, well I just decided to get back into making servers and I just ( I Think) did everything i was supposed to do to start my server. I portforwarded (correctly), I mad a no-ip,  I changed my firewall settings, and I redownloaded no-ip DUC. But none of this is working. I can get on my server without the ip but not with it. 

Does any1 know what might be wrong.</description>
