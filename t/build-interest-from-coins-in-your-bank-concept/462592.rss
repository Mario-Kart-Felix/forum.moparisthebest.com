    <description>Edit: Just added this to Hyperion.

I was playing around with a few things I was learning in Java and decided to write a class based on the concept of having coins in your bank and them build interest over the course of a week.

This is not copy and paste, it&#39;s a concept. Use the formula and implement to your server&#39;s format. This formula adds 1% of your current amount of coins to your bank each day. Starting with 1M you will have accumulated an extra 72k (per week) just in interest. I think this would be an awesome feature for a server.

[code=java]
public class InterestRate {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		boolean banking;
		int coins = 995;
		double coinsAmount = 1000000; //1m
		
		/**
		 * Check for the bank method
		 */
		if(banking = true) {
			
			/**
			 * Check for coins inside your bank
			 */
			if(coins == 995) {
				double amount;
				double principle = coinsAmount;
				double rate = 0.01; //1%
				
				/**
				 * 7 days in total
				 */
				for(int day = 1; day &lt;= 7; day++) {
					amount = principle * Math.pow(1 + rate, day) * 100;
					coinsAmount += amount;
					System.out.println(&quot;Day &quot; + day + &quot;    You now have &quot; + Math.round(amount) / 100 + &quot; coins (&quot; + rate + &quot;% interest rate)&quot;);;
				}
			}
		}
	}

}
[/code]

You can simply copy and paste this into a new class and run it on it&#39;s own to see the output, and then implement the concept to your server. The output is as follows:

Day 1    You now have 1010000 coins (0.01% interest rate)
Day 2    You now have 1020100 coins (0.01% interest rate)
Day 3    You now have 1030301 coins (0.01% interest rate)
Day 4    You now have 1040604 coins (0.01% interest rate)
Day 5    You now have 1051010 coins (0.01% interest rate)
Day 6    You now have 1061520 coins (0.01% interest rate)
Day 7    You now have 1072135 coins (0.01% interest rate)</description>

              <p>Cool idea, but banks can’t make money from just giving free interest. They have to turn around and loan out money that people deposit! Why not allow banks to give out loans [at high interest rates], and allow the interest rates of deposits and loans to fluctuate?</p>
<p>You could have a lot of fun setting up a system like this, lot of ways to regulate it. You could even setup a customer loyalty system, the longer a player has been on the server, the better interest rates they can receive.</p>

              <p>It’s an good idea, but in practice it’s bad for the economy of the server. If everyone has access to the same free thing, and there is no correlative sink to siphon the generated money from the game (without providing extra benefits), you may as well give the players access to a command that gives them X GP every day.</p>
<p>In short, there are reasons banks can give interest out to savings accounts, and it’s because they also take money from other accounts. If your economy is acting as the model for the bank (giving interest), then it needs to take as well, or you end up with uncontrollable inflation and devaluation of your currency.</p>
<p>EDIT - I do want to emphasize though that it’s great that you are coming up with ideas <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>lul. Nothing else to say about that.</p>
<p>OT: Great release, and great idea.</p>
<p>You could really thrive from this. Here’s and idea for the tax, make it about once a week, but make it so that all accounts get it at one time, online or offline, so that when the log in they have to pay the tax, or it gets removed from their amount of coins, but make it random so that they don’t know when to drop their coins and cheat the system.</p>

              <p>^Omg yes. And a dole office for the poor lol. You actually gave me a few ideas. Currently the basic system I wrote only works when you are logged in. The intention was to use it so it accumulates a block of interest once per day, but for the sake of concept I obviously did not write all those methods to run in a separate program.</p>
<p>Now I’ve added it to my server I’m going to implement the interest per day system and maybe some of those additions you mentioned. I also plan to make it run regardless whether the player is on or offline, I just haven’t figured that out yet. Perhaps a separate thread?</p>

              <p>Adding a feature like this is good for several reasons. A few being:</p>
<ol>
<li>Veteran players will be rewarded by this system.</li>
<li>Players who quit could be encouraged to come back, because of the interest that has accumulated in their Bank.</li>
<li>Everyone likes Gold and everyone needs it. Players would login just once per day to check on their interest rates.</li>
<li>Interest adds a whole new concept to the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few things that could be derived from this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bank loans with interest that must be paid back.</li>
<li>Investments. Whether this be stocks, bonds, houses, ect.</li>
<li>Preferred Customer status at banks, thus resulting in small benefits, such as perhaps being able to use the Quick-Deposit box.</li>
<li>Item Pawns. You can Pawn any item at a fraction of It’s price, and you have a certain time limit to pick the Item up. If you fail to pick it up from Pawn, interest will keep accumulating until you eventually lose it.</li>
</ol>
