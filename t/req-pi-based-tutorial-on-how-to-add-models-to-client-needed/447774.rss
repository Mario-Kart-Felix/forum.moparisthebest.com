<p>What a stupid logic. And what do you mean by convert ints? You ints are ints, you can’t convert them.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span><br>
Custom ints go into your class8/itemDef class. You can find renamers around on google, just google something like model renamers or something similar.</p>
