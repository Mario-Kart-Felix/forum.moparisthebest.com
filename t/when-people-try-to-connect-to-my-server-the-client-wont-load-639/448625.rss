              <p>Make sure your cache is in the right location and is compatible with the revision you are loading. If thats not the problem then id suggest uTorrent, just download it on the bottem right corner there is like a little box its like |        |   click in the middle disable broadband test, and then put in port 43594 or whatever port your running on and then test it, if this does not help idk what to tell ya tbh…</p>
<p>Best of luck.</p>
