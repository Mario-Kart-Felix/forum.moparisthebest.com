    <title>[PI] Summoning npcs don&#39;t attack</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-summoning-npcs-dont-attack/519751</link>
    <description>Currently the summoning npcs do not attack anything. If I would click on a NPC it will move to it but nothing will happen. If I would use a  Steel Titan it will not attack anything but I would use the special it will do do damage. I&#39;m not sure what class this would be handled in or what methods to call to make them attack so any help is appreciated.</description>
