<p>I don’t know how things work in UK because I’m with Virgin Media and I’ve still been torrenting around 60gb worth of videos/software etc a month or so. Most/all(?) pirating websites are blocked but I’ve been using a proxy to grab magnet links and not once has my ISP said anything? It seems more of a US thing where they actually take action depending on bandwidth usage (from what I’ve seen anyway) I could be wrong.</p>

RSCShadow is trying to say that you have a better chance to do those things than to get a lawsuit against you for pirating, which like you said isn’t relevant to criminal charges itself, but that wasn’t the intent in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>Assuming you shared music online for all five years of the RIAA’s legal hunt, among an (eventual) crowd of 45.6 million, that’s a one in 1,629 chance of getting caught during that time period. If we convert that to the one-year odds so frequently cited for freak accidents, you’re looking at a one in 8,129 chance, in any given year. You’re more likely to be killed in an accidental injury within the same year (a one-in-2,517 roll of the dice every time you put another candle in the cake) than face an RIAA lawsuit.</blockquote>
