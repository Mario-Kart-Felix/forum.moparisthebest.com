                    if(c.getItems().playerHasItem(85)) {
                            c.getPA().movePlayer(3087, 3493, 0);
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Alert##QUEST COMPLETE!##REWARD:##500k coins and 300k woodcutting experience&quot;);
                    } else {
                        c.sendMessage(&quot;Alert##You need to find the shiny key first!##CLUE: what WOOD be the best way out?&quot;);
                    }
