[b]V. Fishing for Profit[/b]

1-20 Shrimp/Anchovy(level 15)
20- 62 Trout/Salmon (level 30)
62-90 Monkfish (Requires the quest Swan Song)
90-99 Rocktail

1-20
Grab a small net (put it in your belt slot) and head off to Draynor Village to begin your journey to riches! Fish using the net in the water south west of the bank. Bank or drop your shrimp as your inventory fills and continue to do this until you can catch anchovy. Once you can catch anchovy stay at this spot for 5 more levels until you reach level 20 fishing.

20-62
Congratz on getting 20 fishing, now for the fun part! 62 fishing may seem like a far way away but it easily obtainable with patience. Now we will need a flyfishing rod (which can also be put in the belt slot) and some feathers and head to your favorite river around RuneScape. I went to Lumbridge while flyfishing. Now Click a Lure Fishing Spot on the river and star to catch trout. After you catch 1 trout click it and put it in your ability bar, by doing this you are now able to drop this fish in 1 click or one push of a key. Right click your slot that has the trout in it and select Customize key-bind and choose whatever key you feel most comfortable with. Another way to drop the fish is to just simply click the slot with your mouse. Continue this until 30 fishing which will unlock Salmon as an alternate fish that you will catch. The rates for salmon are lower than Trout as it is a higher level to catch but you will start to see Salmon in your inventory as you flyfish. Continue this until you reach level 62 fishing which will grant you access to Monkfish with the completion of Swan Song!

62-90 
This is where the money starts to come in! At current prices Raw Monkfish sells for just over 380gp each! AFTER you have complete swan song head over to the Piscatoris Fishing Colony and begin to fish with a Small Fishing Net. Just a few steps from the fishing spots is a bank so you can offload your catch very quickly. Continue to fish here until level 90 fishing. This may take some time as the xp rates are not the at only around 30-40k per hour but the profit is what we&#39;re after, right?
[img]http://i.imgur.com/tpcDAUj.png[/img]

90-99
Well you finally made it! Level 90 fishing, now what...well lets try Rocktails. At current values Rocktail sells for over 1.4k gp ea! Before fishing for these nice bits of money you must first buy a couple of items. First you need is a Fishing Rod, and secondly is Living Mineral. The Living Mineral is the bait in which you use to catch Rocktail. Buy as much as you can afford as you will be making your money back and then some seeing as at current values this bait is a steal at just over 40gp ea! Head over to the Dwarven Mine and go down into the Living Rock Caverns. Here you will be able to fish Rocktail and bank at the pulley system. You may want to bring some armor to wear to fend off the attacks of the monsters that reside down there. Now stay here from 90-99 and beyond to make maximum profits from fishing!

[b]VI. Fishing for XP[/b]

1-20 (xp rate-slow)
Same as before you&#39;re going to start off fishing shrimp and anchovy until you are able to fish for trout.

20-70/99 (xp rate-moderate)
From level 20 all the way to 99 you can stay at fly fishing and have xp rates as much as 70-80k per hour using urns full fishing outfit and the ability bar to drop your fish. The other option is to start at 70 fishing and do C2 Fishing at Daemonheim.

70-99 (xp rate-high)
If you choose to stop at 70 and try out C2 Fishing then you will see some of the highest xp rates in game capable of reaching over 110k xp per hour at higher levels. Now with gaining that much xp in a skill like fishing it doesn&#39;t come without its downsides. C2 Fishing is very click intensive and to some people can get very aggravating to do. Now for how to C2 fish. Firstly get a Ring of Kinship and teleport to Daemonheim. Open up the ring and form a party. Climb down the dungeon entrance and select a floor (preferably a lower level one) and select complexity 2. Once in the dungeon sell some items from your inventory to the smuggler and buy 250 feathers. Now rush the dungeon searching for fishing spots, fish stacks in your inventory so no need for having to drop anything. Once you have exhausted all of the spots you can do end the dungeon and repeat.</description>

Should test out the xp/hr on each spot aswell<br>
[/quote]This ^</p>
<p>A major thing I look for when searching for training methods is the xp/hr[/quote]<br>
When I update it later tonite with the fast xp rate method I’ll add the rates, I didn’t add them for this one because it is based off of profiting not xp.</p>
<p>EDIT: Updated with familiars/fishing gear/auras/urns ect… might add more info about them ect…</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">V. Fishing for Profit</span></p>
<p>1-20 Shrimp/Anchovy(level 15)<br>
20- 62 Trout/Salmon (level 30)<br>
62-90 Monkfish (Requires the quest Swan Song)<br>
90-99 Rocktail</p>
<p>1-20<br>
Grab a small net (put it in your belt slot) and head off to Draynor Village to begin your journey to riches! Fish using the net in the water south west of the bank. Bank or drop your shrimp as your inventory fills and continue to do this until you can catch anchovy. Once you can catch anchovy stay at this spot for 5 more levels until you reach level 20 fishing.<br>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>20-62<br>
Congratz on getting 20 fishing, now for the fun part! 62 fishing may seem like a far way away but it easily obtainable with patience. Now we will need a flyfishing rod (which can also be put in the belt slot) and some feathers and head to your favorite river around RuneScape. I went to Lumbridge while flyfishing. Now Click a Lure Fishing Spot on the river and star to catch trout. After you catch 1 trout click it and put it in your ability bar, by doing this you are now able to drop this fish in 1 click or one push of a key. Right click your slot that has the trout in it and select Customize key-bind and choose whatever key you feel most comfortable with. Another way to drop the fish is to just simply click the slot with your mouse. Continue this until 30 fishing which will unlock Salmon as an alternate fish that you will catch. The rates for salmon are lower than Trout as it is a higher level to catch but you will start to see Salmon in your inventory as you flyfish. Continue this until you reach level 62 fishing which will grant you access to Monkfish with the completion of Swan Song!<br>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>62-90<br>
This is where the money starts to come in! At current prices Raw Monkfish sells for just over 380gp each! AFTER you have complete swan song head over to the Piscatoris Fishing Colony and begin to fish with a Small Fishing Net. Just a few steps from the fishing spots is a bank so you can offload your catch very quickly. Continue to fish here until level 90 fishing. This may take some time as the xp rates are not the at only around 30-40k per hour but the profit is what we’re after, right?<br>

</div></a></div></p>
<p>90-99<br>
Well you finally made it! Level 90 fishing, now what…well lets try Rocktails. At current values Rocktail sells for over 1.4k gp ea! Before fishing for these nice bits of money you must first buy a couple of items. First you need is a Fishing Rod, and secondly is Living Mineral. The Living Mineral is the bait in which you use to catch Rocktail. Buy as much as you can afford as you will be making your money back and then some seeing as at current values this bait is a steal at just over 40gp ea! Head over to the Dwarven Mine and go down into the Living Rock Caverns. Here you will be able to fish Rocktail and bank at the pulley system. You may want to bring some armor to wear to fend off the attacks of the monsters that reside down there. Now stay here from 90-99 and beyond to make maximum profits from fishing!<br>

</div></a></div></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">VI. Fishing for XP</span></p>
<p>1-20 (xp rate-slow)<br>
Same as before you’re going to start off fishing shrimp and anchovy until you are able to fish for trout.</p>
<p>20-70/99 (xp rate-moderate)<br>
From level 20 all the way to 99 you can stay at fly fishing and have xp rates as much as 70-80k per hour using urns full fishing outfit and the ability bar to drop your fish. The other option is to start at 70 fishing and do C2 Fishing at Daemonheim.</p>
<p>70-99 (xp rate-high)<br>
If you choose to stop at 70 and try out C2 Fishing then you will see some of the highest xp rates in game capable of reaching over 110k xp per hour at higher levels. Now with gaining that much xp in a skill like fishing it doesn’t come without its downsides. C2 Fishing is very click intensive and to some people can get very aggravating to do. Now for how to C2 fish. Firstly get a Ring of Kinship and teleport to Daemonheim. Open up the ring and form a party. Climb down the dungeon entrance and select a floor (preferably a lower level one) and select complexity 2. Once in the dungeon sell some items from your inventory to the smuggler and buy 250 feathers. Now rush the dungeon searching for fishing spots, fish stacks in your inventory so no need for having to drop anything. Once you have exhausted all of the spots you can do end the dungeon and repeat.</p>
