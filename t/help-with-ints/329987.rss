    <title>Help with ints?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-ints/329987</link>
    <description>ok so this other guy was asking me about a reborn command and i gave him some code. then i thought about it and i thought maybe i should put it in my server. then when i use the command, it should say &quot;you are now reborn!&quot; but it doesn&#39;t, and the reborn in my character filles doesn&#39;t even change. can anybody tell me how to change it?

here&#39;s my code:


[code]
		if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;reborn&quot;)) {
		if(reborn != 1) {
			sM(&quot;you can&#39;t be reborn twice!&quot;);
			}
if(reborn != 0 &amp;&amp; getLevelForXP(playerXP[0]) &gt;= 99 &amp;&amp; getLevelForXP(playerXP[1]) &gt;= 99 &amp;&amp; getLevelForXP(playerXP[2]) &gt;= 99 &amp;&amp; getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]) &gt;= 99 &amp;&amp; getLevelForXP(playerXP[4]) &gt;= 99 &amp;&amp; getLevelForXP(playerXP[5]) &gt;= 99 &amp;&amp; getLevelForXP(playerXP[7]) &gt;= 99) {
reborn = 1;
sM(&quot;you are now reborn!&quot;);
playerLevel[0] = 1;
playerLevel[1] = 1;
playerLevel[2] = 1;
playerLevel[3] = 1;
playerLevel[4] = 1;
playerLevel[5] = 1;
playerLevel[7] = 1;

playerXP[0] = 0;
playerXP[1] = 0;
playerXP[2] = 0;
playerXP[3] = 0;
playerXP[4] = 0;
playerXP[5] = 0;
playerXP[7] = 0;
}
}
[/code]


and i added a new line in my char files and made an int that saves to it. so does anybody have some suggestions?

edit: i just remembered, the very same problem happens when i tried making an infhp command.</description>

<p>That way you can check if the command even changes your reborn-amount.<br>
I would also add an<br>
else{<br>
sM(“You do not meet the requirements to be reborn!”);<br>
}[/code]<br>
after the part of the command that handles what to do if you meet the requirements.<br>
This way you can check if the command reads your levels right. If your levels are 99 etc, but the command says that you do not meet the requirements yet, something is going wrong <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Hmm well I’m not sure why it wouldn’t save the reborn-amount, but I did see some flaws in your code.</p>
<p>At the start of your command, you’re saying this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(reborn != 1) {
                        sM("you can't be reborn twice!");    
                    }</code></pre>
<p>Basicly what you’re saying there is that you cannot be reborn when your reborn-amount is not equal to 1. But, this also means you cannot be reborn when your reborn-amount is 0. Because 0 is not equal to 1 as far as I know <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Next you are saying:</p>
<p><code> if(reborn != 0  &amp;&amp; bunchOfLevelsHere()) {
reborn = 1;
// More stuff </code></p>
<p>Now what you are saying there, is that if your reborn amount is not equal to 0, and your levels are 99, your reborn amount get’s set to 1.  Now this would be impossible to achieve.  This would mean you need a reborn-amount of more, or less, then 0 before you are able to be reborn.</p>
<p>So I would suggest switching those 2 around, because now this code just does nothing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
