On upgrading my RealFlow license to RF4, I got RF4.

I decided to test out all the new stuff. Took a while to get used to, then I got an idea.
See how quickly I could fill a bottle and simulate it falling, because it took ages in RF3.

So I modeled the bottle in C4D. Then made a horrible scene, and threw in some HDRI lighting.

Set up everything in RF4, and started simulating.

While that was going on, I started setting up the renderer&amp;materials in C4D, as usual.

Actually, I think I did an excellent job on the Dasani material and the water shader. All made from scratch.

When 600 frames were calculated, I started rendering them out in C4D, to try and catch up with RF4&#39;s output. Just so I didn&#39;t have to calulate all 1200 frames, then render, I decided to do both at the same time pretty much.

This took up quite a few days, with calculating&amp;rendering from 11PM to 7AM almost every day.

Well around the 1100th frame in RF4, the calculation decided to kinda die out. It took about 9 hours for it to get 45% of just one frame done. Dunno what caused this, but I just figured hey this is far enough anyways.

So I rendered the rest out with C4D. Then composited it in After Effects.

Now this is what it&#39;s turned into.
Sorry for the quality. YouTube jacked it up. If anyone wants the real high quality vid, just ask.

<p>But these are just small details.  Its just like…it looks real, but not <span class="bbcode-i">real</span> real, you know?  I watched it 10 times to compile this list.[/quote]</p>
<p>no bubbles cause I didn’t waste time with gaseous emitters and such. wayyy too much work for something that small.</p>
<p>&amp;&amp;I didn’t think YouTube crapped up quality that bad. but in my version, you can see it splash.</p>
<p>the water comes out like that (cylindrical) because it comes out of the top of the bottle, which is shaped like that. it’s not gonna spread out, it would come out like that shape, logically.</p>
<p>but it’s not like I wasted time modeling all of this. so it’s no minus for me hahaha.</p>
<p>I just threw in a scene, and spent maybe five minutes on that bottle. then set up the scene in RealFlow and let that work. then rendered. took maybe 10-20 minutes out of a day at the most.</p>
<p>I’m gonna upload to googlevideo and see if the quality’s any better there.<br>
cause YouTube reallllly took it down.</p>
