<p>Yeah, you can do it yourself. Not hard, you’re right. But, the awesome part about VPS companies is they will do it for you.</p>
<p>When I ordered my VPS, I wrote a note to them in the order asking to have port 43594 opened in the firewall and wherever else they may have needed to open it (some vps companies are different…).<br>
So when I got on it all I had to do was put the server on it and start it.</p>

<p>with vps you have to manually allow port 43594 inbound and outbound in firewall rules, maybe thats the problem?</p>

<p>No you don’t.<br>
Talk to the VPS host. They’ll do it for you.</p>

<p>You need to ask them (NOT US) to make sure <span class="bbcode-b">port 43594 is open for both inbound and outbound connections</span>.<br>
And you can probably ask them to open your windows firewall (if you are on windows and it is enabled).</p>
<p>The rest is cake.</p>
<p>Run No-IP (so it acts as a DNS).<br>
Run your server.<br>
Change the IP in the client to the No-IP if not already.<br>
Jar the client<br>
Distribute it<br>
???<br>
profit.</p>
