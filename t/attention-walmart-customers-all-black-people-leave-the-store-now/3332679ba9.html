</aside>
<p>They said that in 2000 but instead of 2050 it was 2015. But theres a big difference. The whites may become the minority but they will not suffer from poverty etc like the majority of the current minorities, so they would still be raised right and do better in school and be more successful. But it won’t matter. If right now you take a wealthy black and white man and have them be business partners, race would be the last thing on their mind. But if you’re poor its what you blame for your poverty, unless you’re born into it by your 16 year old mother. And if thats the case then that goes back into the circle of stereotypes that happen to be true.</p>
<p>Im not saying theres no successful blacks, some make it very far in life, and others are doped before they finish high school. Just like whites but it happens to be less with them.</p>
<p>This may sound ridiculous to you Mopman, and i can see that. Ask a foreign exchange student that has been in a southern state.</p>

<p>Look at all the results. People asking if it is possible or if it exists, search for racism against blacks and you get a bunch of news articles related to incidents.</p>

        <p>I’m really getting tired of all the racism shit posted on these forums. Thankfully, this was a serious topic(or at least turned into one.) I don’t find racism in any form funny. Racism has really just boiled down to hatred on culture, rather than the physical nature, that it used to be.</p>
<p>My best friends are black, and I’m white. In fact, I live in Kentucky, a southern state which is known for racism. I fit one of the many stereotypes for my race, and my culture. I wear the boots, the clothes, etc. But still some of my best friends are city boys, who have a completely different culture. I don’t ever think, or say a single racist thought, and that can be corroborated by my friends. I don’t see them as inferior in any way shape or form.</p>
<p>But it’s those fucking punk kids that, just so happen to most often grow up in the suburbs, go to predominately white public schools/private schools, and more often than not, never see or speak to a black person. Like the case with a few people here, I’m not being judgmental. But those of you who used the term, African American, how many black people do you know well, better than being an acquaintance. ALL of the black people I know, my friends, their family, they don’t like to be called African American. They were born in America, that makes them American. When you go to Europe, do you call them African European? The majority of black people today who live outside of Africa, were not born in Africa.</p>

        <p>I think the point is that “black” doesn’t refer to a specific race, and a small minority of black people feel the word should reflect where they originate from rather than assuming all black people come from blackland.</p>
<p>I mean, you wouldn’t refer to asians as “brown” but rather something a bit more meaningful, right?</p>
<p>In practice though black is fine and everyone knows what the fuck you mean, and nobody gets offended. I don’t get pissed off when people call me white and go OMG BUT THAT COULD BE FRENCH BRITISH IRISH AMERICAN etc.</p>
<p>This thread is pretty sad because it’s not so much racial intolerance as a complete lack of understanding of the world. The fact Frell thinks that white people, given the same circumstances as oppressed minorities, wouldn’t succumb to the same fate by virtue of being white… I dunno, sorry Frell but I have to assume you’re trolling again. I know you think I attack you or whatever, but really everything you say is just so consistently stupid. It’s not personal, you’re just misguided.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was your perfect white upbringing.</p>

        <p>You’re right. But I’m going more towards culture, than ethnicity. The whole motherland thing with some black people, I think that’s more because of their lack of identity, so they look for one in the culture of their ancestors. As is the case with white people. Italian Americans, are very in tune with their culture.</p>
<p>You really have said everything that I was trying to get at. It’s a lack of understanding of other people’s culture is where this racism stems from I do believe.</p>

<p>Of course we would hear about it if it had said whites, christ.</p>

<p>For example, a high school in florida had a hispanic club, an african american club, and asian club etc.  A white girl wanted to create a caucasian club and the NAACP and all other similar organizations were all over it calling it racist.  It happens more often than not.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>By which you mean it happened once, and you’re never gonna let it go because it gives you something to cry about when nobody is talking about the healthcare bill or how america is being overrun by mexicans.</p>
<p>Honestly, that event you described sucks, but uh… one retarded incident does not mean shit.</p>
<p>Also, are you sure the NAACP was not for abolishing ALL of the clubs? Because I’d campaign against a hispanic club and a black club too. All of them are retarded.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s just an example, that happens all the time.  How about the current law of the USA?  They call it ‘Affirmative Action’ which is a nice way to say racism in action.  Basically the law tries to give jobs, scholarships, and various other chances to less qualified minorities over more qualified ‘white’ people, just because the people are minorities.  If that isn’t racism in action, I don’t know what is.  I had to work my way all the way through college and currently owe a lot of money to the government that I borrowed to go to college.  Every time I visited the financial aid office all you could find were many brochures about scholarships and financial aid you could get IF you were asian, or african american, or hispanic, or a woman.  NO scholarship was available only to white males like myself, why is that?  It is because if someone were to start a scholarship where the requirements were to be a white male, the NAACP and other organizations would be all over that like white on rice, calling it racist.  Do you think otherwise?  Because this is my actual experience on this issue.</p>

<p>But who is truly to blame for this? There are groups that look out for the interest of the white race. It’s called the Ku Klux Klan, just because white people are too afraid to take action when it comes to race wars, and in stead choose to shy away from doing anything offensive. Doesn’t make it the minorities fault.</p>

</aside>
<p>The term ‘racism’, I think we can agree, in this context is best defined as “discrimination against or antagonism towards other races” (“Racism”, Oxford English Dictionary). And to discriminate - [to] “make an unjust distinction in the treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, sex, or age” ("Discriminate, Oxford English Dictionary). The real question then falls upon whether or not this is a just distinction or not. Within the American System (a system that encourages socioeconomic class distinction and separation, which often falls upon racial lines), discrimination is evident, and has been evident. Affirmative Action was created in the 1960s by Lyndon Johnson because severe discrimination was occurring within employment, education and business, despite the illegality of such discrimination. Affirmative Action is also based on gender, not just race (white women are it’s greatest beneficiaries) - but this topic is about race, so I won’t bring that up. Don’t think for a second that this discrimination is gone - the numbers don’t show that. Personal income distribution for Whites according to the Census Beaureau: <a href="http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_002.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_002.htm</a><br>
Personal income distribution for Blacks according to the Census Beaureau: <a href="http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_005.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/perinc/new03_005.htm</a><br>
As you can see, there is still a great level of disparity in America (this was just an example, there are other ways as well). Affirmative Action tries to balance this out - and try to bring SOME fairness to an unfair system. Racism is the cause of the problem; affirmative action attempts to neutralize that racism. I could go on but I’m pretty sick and this is already disorderly enough so yeah  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>tl;dr - Affirmative Action consists of a distinction. Is that distinction just or not? Capitalism encourages class differences, which often falls upon race, at least in America. Lobbyist groups such as the NAACP push for Affirmative Action to try and level the playing field, so to speak, so that people who did not have a fair shot due to racism/sexism now do. In my opinion this is just.</p>
<p>P.S.<br>
An important thing to remember is that whether something is ‘just’ or ‘unjust’ is all a matter of opinion, there is no correct answer to this question.</p>

<p>And why is that? Your anti-black nonsense just proves the point: white people don’t like black people. So black people have a hard time getting a decent job, and because education in America either sucks or isn’t affordable for most black people, they end up uneducated and without a bright future. You end up with a vicious circle, and groups like the NAACP try to break this circle.</p>
<p>Something similar is going on here in the Netherlands. There are a lot of properly educated doctors from the Middle-East living here, but because they have to pass a language test without being able to prepare they aren’t allowed to actually work as a doctor. So they end up frustrated and doing shitty jobs.</p>

<p>There’s nothing for me to “not get” because you haven’t provided any proof of evidence of your bullshit statement. I’m supposed to just empathise with you because I’m a middle-class white male, not because I’ve actually seen any evidence of what you say going on.</p>

Lol, Mopman doesn’t get it. Bottom line, non-whites are afforded things that whites are not due to action groups (such as the NAACP), and these same groups act as watchdogs of white behaviour. Likewise, they receive leeway when their behaviour is called in to question.<br>

<p>And why is that? Your anti-black nonsense just proves the point: white people don’t like black people. So black people have a hard time getting a decent job, and because education in America either sucks or isn’t affordable for most black people, they end up uneducated and without a bright future. You end up with a vicious circle, and groups like the NAACP try to break this circle.</p>
<p>Something similar is going on here in the Netherlands. There are a lot of properly educated doctors from the Middle-East living here, but because they have to pass a language test without being able to prepare they aren’t allowed to actually work as a doctor. So they end up frustrated and doing shitty jobs.[/quote]</p>
<p>As I have said, I have a few black friends. Believe it or not, there ARE Black’s that do something with there life. BUT, according to statistics, the MAJORITY of prisons are the Blacks, yet they are a MINORITY in America. It tells you something about most of there population. They are scum, who don’t mind going to jail. Infact, most of them go to jail, get out, and actually want to go right BACK in, because they have nothing else to live for, it’s like a game.</p>
<p>But, according to niggers, (as you said they don’t like there actual race name)white’s are racist! Sure, there are whites in jail, and in gangs, but statistics show that its a very minor amount. It’s human nature to shut out people who are unlike themselves; I hate hanging out with druggies.</p>
<p>Oh, and another thing… They call each other Nigger left and right… “Hey nigger, give me some of that my nigger!”; yet if you were to make one comment with “Nigger” in it, you would be in shit because you used a “racial slur”.</p>

        <p>Kozy, i have black friends also. Theres a difference between niggers and black people (socially).</p>
<p>About how they say nigger alot and when whites say it they flip, thats true. But i like how also they rarely say cracker and when they do no one cares which is why it is rarely done. There is no reaction to gain pleasure from.</p>
<p>Your first paragraph brought back a funny memory. In English we were talking about stereotypes because the teacher was getting frustrated, so she said “What about serial killers? Theres rarely any black serial killers, they’ve all been white.” And i said “Just because the blacks rape them first doesn’t mean its not murder.” Tables turned, i was eyed, and we went back to learning English.</p>

<p>You are making several assumptions here, and using faulty reasoning. You make the assumption that people who go to prison are “scum who don’t mind going to jail”. You then induce (based off of a false assumption) that because these members of the race have this trait, the majority of the population do. You continue to make false assumptions with your next sentence - a sentence which, even if you could have some sort of source for, is horribly overgeneralizing.</p>
<p>Based off of faulty logic, yes you do have a point… but if you were to remove the fallacies and clean up the faulty reasoning, the point dissipates with it.</p>

<p>There’s nothing for me to “not get” because you haven’t provided any proof of evidence of your bullshit statement. I’m supposed to just empathise with you because I’m a middle-class white male, not because I’ve actually seen any evidence of what you say going on.</p>
<p>But no, there is no racism against black people anymore, it’s all imagined, clearly.[/quote]<br>
Mopar provided one.</p>
<p>I do believe that their are scholarships here which are geared specifically at certain groups based on their races, without equivalent scholarships for the white male.<br>
Now white families, in general, may be more affluent than aboriginal families.<br>
The same applies when considering American families, or British families. But what about the poorer white families? Surely poor white males deserve a chance to ‘break the vicious cycle’ as well.</p>
