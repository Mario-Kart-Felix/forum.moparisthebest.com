    <title>Custom items in game problem (allready added)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-items-in-game-problem-allready-added/370904</link>
    <description>Hello all, 
i am trying to add custom items into my server, and its working, but ive hit a small problem.

So, I have:
Made the model with metasequioa
made the drop model
made them both .dat
gzipped them
created int&#39;s
put int&#39;s and models in proper place
changed item.java in server files to fit the item (boots)
ive spawned the items in game, they worked, the sword worked fine, but when i attack, it disappears.

Now, im not asking a long responce on how to do this and fix it (because im sure its hard/takes a while and no one will want to take their time to type it all out), im just looking for the name of a program to do it, or a link to a tutorial or somehting along those lines.


thanks</description>
