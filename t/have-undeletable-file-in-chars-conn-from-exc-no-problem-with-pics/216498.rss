    <description>I got a way to fix that problem

first what you want to do is make backup off all your charaters and connect from files but dont backup the undeletable file just put over to the side

heres a image
[IMG]http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc214/omfgevertime/help2.jpg[/img]
[b]DONT[/b] backup the undeletable on

ok the next step could go two ways

1:you have a char deleter go to step 3

2:you dont have a char deleter go to step 2



STEP 2:[making char deleter] ok now what you want to do is make a char deleter

First make a text document
name it char deleter
[IMG]http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc214/omfgevertime/help3.jpg[/img]

go into the document and put in this code
&lt;blockquote&gt;@echo off
:menu
color 09
echo This utility can be used to clear all of the current character information
echo WARNING: Once you use this, there will be no way to recover lost character files

==100% Credits To Mr Gunz==
echo.
echo Type C to clear all character files and information
echo Type E to exit this utility
echo.
set /p option=Option:
if %option%==c goto clear
if %option%==C goto clear
if %option%==e goto exit
if %option%==E goto exit
if %option%==* goto error
goto error
:clear
cls
del /F /S /Q characters
del /F /S /Q connectedfrom
del /F /S /Q moreinfo
del /F /S /Q savedgames
echo All character related information has been deleted now
pause
exit
:exit
cls
exit
:error
echo An error has occured
echo Press enter to go back to the main menu
pause&lt;/blockquote&gt;

save it again as Char Deleter.bat


STEP 3:(you have the char deleter now)


open it and it should say this
[IMG]http://i215.photobucket.com/albums/cc214/omfgevertime/help4.jpg[/img]

now type c and it should delete all the files in there including the undeletable one


STEP 4:(undeletable files gone)

now go back into chars/connect from/ exc.. and put your backups in!

90% to me
10% for MR Gunz for the char deleter</description>
