    <description>[b]June 22: [/b]&lt;blockquote&gt;A fight in Woodland Park in the Barton and Sanford area last night sent a 32-year-old Hamilton man to hospital in critical condition but he is expected to survive.

Hamilton police say two men, ages 25 and 35, were walking through the northwest area of the park when they came across two men, a woman and a three-year-old child sitting on a bench.

Police don’t yet know if the two groups knew each other, but words were exchanged, escalating to a physical confrontation in which three of the men were stabbed.

One of the men sitting on the bench suffered the worst injuries. He was rushed to hospital after fleeing the scene but collapsing on Barton Street, where police and paramedics found him unconscious after being called to the park around 9:30 p.m. for a disturbance and possible stabbing.

He has been in an induced coma, but is expected to be brought out of it today and is expected to survive, police said.

The other two suffered minor injuries and the fourth man involved, a 36-year-old, was injured but not stabbed. All three are from Hamilton.

The other three men are all from Hamilton.

The park has been roped off from the public today while police continue their investigation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
