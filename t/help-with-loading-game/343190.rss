    <description>not sure if this is right area to put this in but i just signed up and im trying to play and not have to make my own server, i got on the client and i did go to the help tab and clicked server status and chose a server from there and when i got the client loaded again i tried logging in and some error would happen, it was different for every server, i actually got as far as to see the inventory, mini map, and all the buttons but no land scape or any thing in the game. i just want to play around and get cool stuff. plz help me so i can do that.

thank you  :)</description>
