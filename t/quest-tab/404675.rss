    <description>Okay. So I started working on a new project. :P Yeah. Tipicle. xD

I was going through the coding and all. And went over to the quest tab. This just about explains it... e.e

I didn&#39;t know Monkey Madness was free... xD

But no.. I want it so that is LIKE the runescape&#39;s quest... When they were in the &#39;317&#39; days. Like with the old crap stone and stuff. 
But they would be the same, and going through the coding in there nothing shows why the quest are there... Now the question is..
Since this is an old server like thing, would it be in the client files.. Or is it still gonna be in the Server ---&gt; client.java? 
Or texthandler.java? Ehhh. I&#39;m just trying to bring back what was the most awesomest thing ever. Which was runescape in it&#39;s olden days. :D

Edit: It&#39;s Delta Based. &gt;.&gt;

If you could help, help would be lovely. :3
