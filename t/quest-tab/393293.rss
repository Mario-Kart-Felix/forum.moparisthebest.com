              <p>[quote=“Bumm85, post:2, topic:393293”]Well it depends on what revision and base you have. The commands will be similar but will not be the same. Please tell us what revision and base your using and I cna help.<br>
For the ep and players online its pretty much the same so here are the codes.</p>
<p>Players online: +players+<br>
and by ep im guessing you mean sorta like pk points</p>
<p>Ep: +pkpoints+ (change the pkpoints to whatever the ep is called in the character file)[/quote]<br>
could you help me insert them in like with teamviewer cause i tried it and it still doesnt work its showing the other things still. and with ep i mean like extra potential in my server i have ep and it goes up by how much time you spend in a hotzone.</p>
