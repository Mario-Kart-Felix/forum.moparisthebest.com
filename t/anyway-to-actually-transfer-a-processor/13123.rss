    <title>Anyway to actually TRANSFER a processor?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyway-to-actually-transfer-a-processor/13123</link>
    <description>I checked the AMD docs on how to INSTALL a processor, and they were talking about some thermal conductive crap on the heatsink. And because of that, I can&#39;t remove the heatsink once I installed it.

The problem is that I am about to buy a new motherboard, and I don&#39;t want to have to buy a new processor with it =/

So, is there anyway for me to transfer the whole processor with the heatsink over to another mobo? I can&#39;t just remove the processor and let the heatsink go with it, because the heatsink is actually wider than the processor -.- (noway to get to the release lever)</description>

              <p>never having seen an amd heatsink i cant tell you specifically, but will either have 4 plastic …legs… or 2 clip sorta things, if it has clips they are easy enough to undo. if it has legs you will have to turn a thing on top of each (should have an arrow, may need a screwdriver)</p>
<p>yea, you can buy thermal grease <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> it would probably have to be a shop dedicated to selling computer parts though</p>

              <p>You have to remove the heatsink (doing this will ruin the thermal grease/tape), unclip the CPU, do whatever you want to do with it, stick the CPU into the mobo, buy some thermal grease, put the grease ontop of the CPU in a nice even (thick) layer, reattach your heatsink</p>
<p>uuh if you would like me to retype that, just ask ;D</p>
