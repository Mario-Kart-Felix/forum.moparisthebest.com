    <title>The Best Way Of Advertising ($100)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-best-way-of-advertising-100/83963</link>
    <description>Hoping that everything goes fine and dandy, Google ought to be paying me soon, which means I&#39;ll have 100USD to spend on Spiced-FX. I&#39;m not interested in using it for personal use. 

Anyway, the website, in all honesty, kicked off pretty well. It was released Saturday night, and already our traffic is 3GB with 1044+ visits. I am, however, interested in trying to make it something semi-successful, as the site is based on graphics resources. So far, I&#39;ve been finding and adding link after link, and have done pretty well, and it&#39;s got to the point where I need members to start submitting there packs/tutorials/resources. 

The only way to do/get the above is to get more members, and I&#39;m not interested in the cheap sneeky advertising on sites like this which have nothing to do with Graphics, but more professional advertising on graphical sites.

Now, I have a few choices:
1. Personally ask the site for my banner to be displayed for a certain amount of hits/clicks and agree on a fixed price.
2. Get advertising through Google AdSense. The only problem with that is a lot of people ignore or just block the ads completely.
3. Other - That&#39;s where you come in. 

So, yeh, that&#39;s it :) 

I know you lot wont let me done, so I&#39;ll thank you now ;) &lt;3</description>

<p>I’d much rather go with the most popular advertisement scheme. Looks like AdSense it is <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>It is pay by click, but, you’d have to agree to a certain amount of clicks and pay upfront.</p>
<p>Google Adsense was the first thought that came in to my head, but I’m really not sure on how effective it <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> is.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve read many good reviews that it works well.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don’t waste money on those ptc(pay to click) sites. Users come on to click links and make 0.002 cents and they dont pay attention to anything and they just keep clicking links. It’s such a waste of money. I remember we used like 8 gbs of bandwidth one night and not a single person joined the forums lol(on my old site…).</p>

2. Get advertising through Google AdSense. The only problem with that is a lot of people ignore or just block the ads completely.<br>

<p>I am not 100% sure on how it works, but I know you pay by click, so I don’t think it costs you unless people actually click on the link and visit your site.  Plus it would only be advertised on pages with relevant content.  If I was going to advertise that is probably how I would do it.[/quote]</p>
<p>It is pay by click, but, you’d have to agree to a certain amount of clicks and pay upfront.</p>
<p>Google Adsense was the first thought that came in to my head, but I’m really not sure on how effective it <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> is.</p>

              <p>Hoping that everything goes fine and dandy, Google ought to be paying me soon, which means I’ll have 100USD to spend on Spiced-FX. I’m not interested in using it for personal use.</p>
<p>Anyway, the website, in all honesty, kicked off pretty well. It was released Saturday night, and already our traffic is 3GB with 1044+ visits. I am, however, interested in trying to make it something semi-successful, as the site is based on graphics resources. So far, I’ve been finding and adding link after link, and have done pretty well, and it’s got to the point where I need members to start submitting there packs/tutorials/resources.</p>
<p>The only way to do/get the above is to get more members, and I’m not interested in the cheap sneeky advertising on sites like this which have nothing to do with Graphics, but more professional advertising on graphical sites.</p>
<p>Now, I have a few choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personally ask the site for my banner to be displayed for a certain amount of hits/clicks and agree on a fixed price.</li>
<li>Get advertising through Google AdSense. The only problem with that is a lot of people ignore or just block the ads completely.</li>
<li>Other - That’s where you come in.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, yeh, that’s it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I know you lot wont let me done, so I’ll thank you now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> &lt;3</p>
