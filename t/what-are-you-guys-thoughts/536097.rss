    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Lostprophets&#39; frontman Ian Watkins was jailed for alleged child sex crimes almost a year ago.
Despite previously saying he &quot;furiously denies&quot; the charges and asserting today that &quot;he was a victim of a malicious campaign&quot;, Watkins pleaded guilty to the following:
sexual assault involving children (3 counts)
child pornography (six counts)
animal pornography (one count)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I didn&#39;t know this band at all until reading this, but I still think its ridiculous what people will do for people who are &quot;famous&quot;.</description>
