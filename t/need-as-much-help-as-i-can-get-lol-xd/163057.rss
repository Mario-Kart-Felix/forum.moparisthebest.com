    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-as-much-help-as-i-can-get-lol-xd/163057</link>
    <description>I have only been coding a day and didn&#39;t have problems till I got into deleting stuff from project 16 v6 source, im having problems getting rid of summoning, the summoning stuff and songs in the music list, getting rid of all the emotes and the emote interface and getting rid of the quests in the questlist.

any help at all would be great but if you can&#39;t thats cool :)</description>
