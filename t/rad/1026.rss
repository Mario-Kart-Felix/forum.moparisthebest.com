[size=10pt][u]Idea[/u][/size]

This is just a random idea I had to make a radio station.
I will be using the ShoutCAST service for WinAMP. You will need WinAMP to listen.
[hr]
[size=10pt][u]Playlist and Requests[/u][/size]

I will be doing requests as much as possible. Just PM me or e-mail or something. Even post it here, and I will get around to adding it.

The current music I have for play is basically a ton of Metal and Industrial.
Video Game music will also be played, as some tracks r0x.
[hr]
[size=10pt][u]You[/u][/size]

If you have any music you would like to broadcast that you&#39;ve created, let me know.
I will add it to the list of tracks. Please, edit your file information to where you can be contacted, track title, your alias ect.
[hr]

In which case I would like to get this running by Friday or so.
Any questions and ideas can be posted here.</description>
