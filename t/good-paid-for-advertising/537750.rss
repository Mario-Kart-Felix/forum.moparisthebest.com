    <title>Good Paid-For Advertising?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-paid-for-advertising/537750</link>
    <description>The title says it all, we&#39;ve gained around a hundred dollars or so and after VPS expenses we still have some left over to get some advertising on RSPS sites. The only problem is that I have never worked with any paid for sites and I&#39;m wondering what the best ones are? Thanks</description>

              <p>Yeah it was our original goal to bid for Mopar sponsor. We’ll follow through with that now that I’ve gotten the opinion of the public along with some other ideas. Appreciate it guys, and post anymore suggestions if you have them.</p>

Other han that, cane’s post is pretty accurate. It’s a given that you should have your website developer read up on SEO techniques (even at beginner level) to improve your SEO ranking and ultimately give you a better return from search engines.</p>
