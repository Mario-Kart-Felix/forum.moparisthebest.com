              <p>You  can move npcs to a different coord by doing ::dataon I think it is it will give you the coords where your standing.  Now go to the spawn-config file in data folder. You will see it has  like npc = 2 blah blah.</p>
<p>The blah blah is where the coords are. Change that to whatever coords you want.</p>
<p>For moving objects keep the dataon on.</p>
<p>Now go to src-&gt;server-&gt;models-world -&gt; objectmanager/handler I don’t remember which lol  (probably manager ) and go down to customSpawns.  you should see some stuff like (blah,blah,blah,blah,blah) change the coords in that to the new one.</p>
<p>Now to remove objects such as a wall etc you need go t the same area  go to the coords of the object type in the coords into the customSpawn method then you  instead of listing the object id in that array you would just  put -1</p>
