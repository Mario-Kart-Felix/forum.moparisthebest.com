    <title>&quot;Error connecting to server&quot; But idk what the problem is</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-connecting-to-server-but-idk-what-the-problem-is/542614</link>
    <description>I&#39;m posting this here because I don&#39;t think my VPS company will really dig the whole RSPS vibe.

So basically, I have been working on my RSPS called RareScape, it is on a fully functioning VPS (1GB RAM, DDoS protected, 4TB bandwidth etc), I port forwarded, Firewall enabled port, Changed my IP on the server to my NO-IP&#39; IP. 

The weird thing is the server works fine, But randomly while me and 3 other people are on we get DCed, and I check my VPS to see if everything is working and it is, everything should be doing its job. I have to close my NO-IP and re-open it then wait like 6 minutes for it to start working again.

Is it my VPS? Or is No-IP not compatible with VPS&#39;? Or something else idk just help me please. Thanks.</description>

              <p>I don’t think so. The VPS company is a pretty big one, they provided me with one IP address but I’m really not sure on the disconnecting thing.</p>

              <p>Sounds like your VPS doesn’t have a static IP address? Does the IP address change when you get disconnected? If this is the case then you have a terrible host.</p>
