    <title>[HELP] Make Barrage Work [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-make-barrage-work-help/267521</link>
    <description>OK I am using Ddsspeced source and I have just noticed that for some reason spells such as Ice Barrage and Ice Blitz have stopped working. This proves quite anoying as people can then flee from you while PKing and many users complain about it, if anyone can post a reply on how to solve this issue then it would be greatly apreciated :)

Thanks for any help you can give</description>
