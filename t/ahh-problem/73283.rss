    <title>Ahh! Problem!</title>

    <description>Heres the problem...

1. everyone was getting lvl 185 (max) so i wanted to make max 135 not 99.  So, i did tut, and got errors.  I thought i deleted full thing...heres what happened.

2.  First time, everything was out of 200, so i went back and fixed it.  Everyone was messed up on stats.

3.  Stats went back to normal, but new problem.  Everyone started out with lvl 185 combat.  You look at stats, you get 1/99.  Good.

4.  When you lvl up, you have a goal, but when you pass it, it gives new goal, it doesnt change 1 to 2.

Help please![br][size=1]Posted on: April 01, 2007, 09:09:20 PM[/size][hr]Longstory short.  Everyone is lvl 185 when you log in, new user.  How do you change? back to 41?[br][size=1]Posted on: April 01, 2007, 09:15:18 PM[/size][hr]Fixed!</description>
