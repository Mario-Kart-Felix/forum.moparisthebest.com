    <title>Planet x</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/planet-x/257970</link>
    <description>Presented in this video are some photos of what many people call Nibiru and Planet X. They are very real and my evidence is pure fact. What many people do not realise, is that Nibiru is infact a dark star, about half the size of our Sun. It has a number of large planets and moons orbiting around it, one of which is Planet X. It&#39;s kind of like a mini solar system. These objects are heading towards us, as they have done in the distant past. These objects will become visible to every human on Earth within the next couple of years. Some time around 2012/13, these objects will be closer to us than our own Sun, and will dominate the daytime and nighttime sky. Another fact many people do not know about, is that Planet X is an inhabited planet. The US government knows this, and are infact in contact with them because this is not just a catastrophic event for us, it is for them aswell. Many people can be saved, but actions need to be taken NOW. If we leave it to the last minute, it will be to late. Within the next few years, nobody will be able to hide the fact these objects are heading towards us, because they will be seen by everyone and will grow larger as they approach us. Global panic is unavoidable and this event is unavoidable.

              <p>They’ve been talking about it since the 30’s though. They were looking for this planet x, found Pluto instead but they knew it was still not their planet x. So there is still mysteries about the gravitational pull of Neptune, and other things. This basically led all kinds of shit recently about it, twisting it into 2012 and stuff. Bunkers are part of this dumb theory because of that Norwegian politician who was apparently in them said there was like crystal energy etc and other shit no one knows about.</p>
<p>I like reading about the Sumerians though and what they had to say about Nibiru. Also BlazeFire’s explanation of this was different to what I know, I thought Nibiru and planet x were the same name for each other, as well as nemesis, dark star, etc. There are theories that NASA has found it. They found something, but blamed technical difficulties iirc. Theres other “proof” around they are hiding it from us.</p>

<p>It orbits the sun different from other planets. It is almost like it caught onto our solar system, like an asteroid can catch onto a moon or planet. Instead of going counter-clockwise like all other planets, it has an oval shaped clockwise orbit. I read a lot about it but I can’t remember a whole lot, this was when I was awake for like 3 days.</p>

<p>Also Japan has plans to find this planet.</p>

              <p>YES! I was waiting for this topic to be made so that I didn’t have to make one explaining everything <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I think it’s highly interesting just to read about it. Can’t say I believe it. But they are hiding facts about it from us, so there must be something going on. I believe japan wishes to look into it furthur as well. They think they will find it within 10 years.</p>
<p>As for it containing gold-feening aliens/gods, probably not. (Although they are still baffled by the gold mines they found from 10,000 years ago) The bunkers around the world that the government is spending trillions on are quite interesting too. You know, the ones that must be built before 2012. Careful when you use “facts” though. These aren’t facts at all, it’s basically what some researchers have been writing about and selling books by retranslating summerian texts (the first civilization). They do their best to back up their evidence though I would like to read Dark Star, which is a book about it.</p>
<p>It’s the theories around it I like. The time it takes to orbit and how it orbits different from other planets etc, fill in the gap for many mysteries in our own solar system. As well as it explains many of the catastrophic events such as the great flood.</p>
<p>It also explains how this planet is the reason our planets poles are switching. That being said I am only interested by this, and I wouldn’t believe it until I saw it. You would have to look up the claims I made if you want more information.</p>

              <p>That’s some real fake shit, you see just by viewing them. A logical story would be the Polar Shift to occur, in which would cause a second ice age.</p>

              <p>Presented in this video are some photos of what many people call Nibiru and Planet X. They are very real and my evidence is pure fact. What many people do not realise, is that Nibiru is infact a dark star, about half the size of our Sun. It has a number of large planets and moons orbiting around it, one of which is Planet X. It’s kind of like a mini solar system. These objects are heading towards us, as they have done in the distant past. These objects will become visible to every human on Earth within the next couple of years. Some time around 2012/13, these objects will be closer to us than our own Sun, and will dominate the daytime and nighttime sky. Another fact many people do not know about, is that Planet X is an inhabited planet. The US government knows this, and are infact in contact with them because this is not just a catastrophic event for us, it is for them aswell. Many people can be saved, but actions need to be taken NOW. If we leave it to the last minute, it will be to late. Within the next few years, nobody will be able to hide the fact these objects are heading towards us, because they will be seen by everyone and will grow larger as they approach us. Global panic is unavoidable and this event is unavoidable.</p>
