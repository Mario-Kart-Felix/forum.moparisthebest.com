    <title>What VPS Hoster Would Suit my Needs Best?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-vps-hoster-would-suit-my-needs-best/525736</link>
    <description>I plan on releasing my server soon. There&#39;s two developer&#39;s, me and my friend. Our goal is 20 online at a time by the end of the month. This is achievable since we&#39;ve both run servers before and have friends piling up on our Skype accounts asking to play. On launch day, we expect at least 5 players at a time. We&#39;ll probably always be connected to the VPS in some way, shape, or form. We also, cant use Linux. No matter how hard I tried to get my friend aquanited with it, it just didn&#39;t work.

So, here&#39;s what we need.

A VPS that can hold a relatively stable source 24/7 with 20 players. 
Can&#39;t be Linux.
Won&#39;t Blacklist IP&#39;s if they&#39;re not the ones used during registration. (I&#39;ve had this happen, and I had to submit tickets. :/)

Well, I guess it could be Linux if it&#39;s a desktop edition, my friend couldn&#39;t understand how command lines work.... (facepalm)


PS: We&#39;re on a budget. A ramen noodle every night budget. Don&#39;t link me to a site that&#39;ll charge us $60 a month for a cheap VPS.</description>

<p>I would recommend Lazerhosting, they’ve got some pretty cheap ones. They also sell dedicated servers for decent quality VPS-price.</p>
