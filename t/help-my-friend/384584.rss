    <title>Help my friend?</title>

    <description>Hey Moparscapers I come to you today to help my friend Dakota Rose. I&#39;ve known this kid probably since i was 4 or 5 years old. Ever since he was about 10 or 11 he decided he wanted to be in a band (obviously I didn&#39;t have faith in this dream as it was a pretty big wish) 5 to 6 years later I am still friends with him and he is now in a band called Worth The Wait. I love the band and I want to be a part of it too because i love the way he sounds and hes one of my best friends. If you would like to hear some of his stuff go to : http://www.facebook.com/WTWOfficial?ref=ts# &lt;--- Facebook. They have more stuff, but i&#39;m not allowed to leak any of the demos he gave me so you will have to deal with what you got. He may be going on warped tour as well if he gets enough votes in which you can vote here : http://www.battleofthebands.com/u/dakotajrose (if you don&#39;t have an account just make one real fast it takes about 2 mins or less and just vote for him) If you like his music discuss about it and if you don&#39;t tell me what he could work on. He is only 16 and his screams are beast!</description>

I honestly like the music even though I’ve become a more mellow and oldies/classic rock, punk, and underground rap type of person. Wouldn’t mind buying the band’s album if they released one.</p>
