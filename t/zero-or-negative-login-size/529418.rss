    <title>&quot;Zero or negative login size&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zero-or-negative-login-size/529418</link>
    <description>So I kept getting an error in my cmd saying &quot;Zero or negative login size&quot;.
The reason it was happening was because I had Windows Remote Desktop Connection opened, and after closing it I stopped getting the error.
What I want to know is why would having Remote Desktop Connection opened caused problems running the server?
And what exactly does it mean when it says it. And *maybe* if known how would I fix the problem so I can run Remote Desktop Connection.

Note: This might not be considered the proper place for this since I don&#39;t really need help with the problem, since I figured it out.
BUT it was the best place I could think of to place this at.</description>
