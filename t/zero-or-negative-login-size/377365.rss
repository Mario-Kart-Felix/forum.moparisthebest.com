    <description>I&#39;m hosting a nice server; 

Base : [PI] RuneVerfix

Just letting my forum members test it out a bit with updates I made to the source. They can&#39;t log in though. It says Zero or Negative Login Size whenever they try to. It happened before I edited anything I thought it was nothing though...

I downloaded two more sources without editing except for the port etc allowing me to connect. It says the same thing when they try to log in... They all are PI&#39;s (Don&#39;t say PI&#39;s are shit)

Please I really want to host. :s</description>
