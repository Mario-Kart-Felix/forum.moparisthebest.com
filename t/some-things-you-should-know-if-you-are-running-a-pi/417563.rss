    <description>Some things you should know if you are running a PI
Ok, This is just for new coders that are new to PI and RSPS coding.
Btw, I have made this tutorial from my phone.

Information: For Beginners

Some important stuff to know:
If you change any part of your server files you will have to compile then update your server then turn it off and on.   By doing this the server saves every character file and there is no chances of a roll back.  Note:  If you change stuff about a player in the character folder you will have to make sure the character is offline before saving and compiling.

Where important server files are located:
If you need Client.java or anything important you will have to go to your server folder then click on src then server then models then all the neccassartry folders will be there.

I will be adding more stuff soon as I&#39;m on my phone.</description>
