The free trial actually lasts you quite a while, and you can either do a micro-transaction or a subscription service. To buy the ENTIRE game, and never need a subscription, was like 60 dollars when I played (or 40 for sales). That’s one thing I like about it at least. You can pay as you go, and not worry if you end up quitting, because your not paying by the month.</p>
<p>Last time I played this was right after Celestia came out, not sure what’s changed since then though. I may be completely incorrect. I actually am gunna go take a look.</p>
<p>EDIT - Wow, two whole new worlds. I may take this game back up a bit and have a looksie.<br>
