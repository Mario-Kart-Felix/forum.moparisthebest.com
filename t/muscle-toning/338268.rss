    <description>What&#39;s the best way to tone muscles that are already pretty big? Just doing lots of reps on low weight or some other way. 

Thanks.</description>

              <p>Since I started working out!</p>
<p>My workouts don’t consist of heaps though, but they’re better than most people’s nonetheless.<br>
I simply do squats, deadlifts, press/military press (it’s far easier to squeeze the glutes with the feet together, imo), bench press, lateral rows and chinups.<br>
I’m getting a skinfold test done on Tuesday, so maybe I’ll post my bodyfat percentage after that’s done. At the moment I weigh about 78kg.</p>

              <p>First off, it kills my eyes that Lothy just used the word “stabiliser muscles.”  What he was referring to was core.  Doing free weights is a lot better for core muscles, but if you really care all that much more just do core workouts (which I actually find pretty fun).  Seeing as core strength improves balance, durability, and abdominal strength at the same time, it’s a great workout.</p>
<p>P.S. since when does Lothy care/know about working out?</p>

<p>I put 1 cup of rolled oats in my blender and grind them down to a reasonably fine powder. I then put 1 cup of skim milk in along with 1 banana, and grind again. After that, I add 30 grams of protein powder, grind again. Finally, I add another 1 cup of skim milk, grind, and then drink.</p>

<p>Ditch the machines and move to free weights. Machine strength isn’t functional strength, because the machine balances the weight for you. This means that any ‘strength’ gains you make on a machine aren’t usable for real-world purposes (such as physical work).<br>

The problem with the machine weights is that they balance the weight for the user, keeping it in the correct path of motion.<br>
Usually, stabilisation of the weight to ensure proper technique is the responsibility of the person training. When a person does squats as opposed to using a leg press machine, they’re building up all of their little stabiliser muscles too because they’re actively balancing the weight. The guy on the leg press misses out on building these muscles.</p>
<p>What this means is that a guy who can squat 200kg can leg press that or more. Throw a guy who can leg press 200kg into a squat rack for some squats and he might be lucky to squat 50kg… but more than likely just the bar if he has never done it before.<br>
Working with barbell exercises builds strength that you will be able to make use of outside of the gym.</p>

Boxing 4 nights a week isn’t really easy, in my opinion, presuming that’s 4 hours per week. In fact, that’s actually quite a lot of work. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>Even so I was losing it fairly easy just with the decent diet before I boxed, I mean I drank on weekends and still cut fat.</p>
<p>Just need to cut out processed stuff. The less processed the better. Orange &gt; orange juice &gt; orange cake etc</p>
<p>You can eat as much as you want, as long as it’s not crap.</p>

Well, 6 - 8 hours is a lot of time each week. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Congratulations for doing so well.</p>
<p>Regarding rolled oats and rice, I agree. I’ve always wondered why more university students don’t make these two things larger parts of their diet, considering how crying poor we all seem to be. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Ditch the machines and move to free weights. Machine strength isn’t functional strength, because the machine balances the weight for you. This means that any ‘strength’ gains you make on a machine aren’t usable for real-world purposes (such as physical work).</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/</a> for a well balanced strength training program. The site is a gold mine when it comes to strength training and fat loss.</p>

              <p>Well it all depends on what you’re going for.  If you’re looking for size, then you’re looking for a weight that you can do about 8 reps with (you should be feeling a big burn on the last 3 reps). But yes, if you’re looking to tone, go for a lot more cardio to lose your fat.</p>

Boxing 4 nights a week isn’t really easy, in my opinion, presuming that’s 4 hours per week. In fact, that’s actually quite a lot of work. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Is that 3,500,000 calories? If not, why is there a ‘k’?</p>
<p>Also, do all the calories you eat necessarily get absorbed by your body? I’d expect that some remain unabsorbed and end up in your feces.</p>

I could probably drop 4.4 - 11 pounds (2 - 5kg) overnight using diuretics (diuretics dehydrate your body, almost completely eliminating water weight) – people in sports (boxing, MMA, other martial arts) with weight classes do it all the time before fights; that’s <span class="bbcode-b">weight</span> loss right there, and fuck yeah it’s easy.<br>
But <span class="bbcode-b">fat loss</span>, which is what this topic is concerned with, isn’t easy. You can expect to lose 2 pounds of fat per week <span class="bbcode-b">at best</span>. If you lose any more than that then you are most certainly losing muscle tissue.<br>
For the record though, most people will only manage to lose 1 pound of fat per week (which is 3500 kCal) without also losing too much muscle mass.</p>
<p>Yz85Racer is kinda on the right track, presuming I understand what he’s getting at. Why exactly are you looking to reduce bodyfat?<br>
There’s nothing wrong with sitting around 15% bodyfat, which is where the average man is.<br>
Personally, I see bodybuilding for the sake of bodybuilding (ie, aesthetics) as something for morons to waste their time with.<br>
Your muscles aren’t really that functional, you just look like a musclebound dickhead.</p>
<p>If you’re going to do it, do it because of a real reason – whether it’s to become more proficient at some sport you do, or perhaps for the sake of work (particularly anyone here in the armed forces for their country).</p>
