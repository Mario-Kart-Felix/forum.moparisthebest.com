Yes, All of them indeed have passed and in that course there is a very high pass rate encouraging allot more people to start taking it.</p>

45??</p>
<p>I had 2 lessons, at the end of the first the guy told me I would have no issues passing. The second lesson was because I had to get a ride home from my dad’s and a cab was about the same price.</p>

              <p>I did the one-week crash course for my bike test (not car).

At the moment it’s 120 hours, comprised of 10 - 20 hours night driving IIRC.<br>
Apparently they’re raising that to 200+ hours in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to move to Australia then do yourself a favour: get your licence in the country you currently reside in and then make the move so you avoid the ridiculous burden placed on both yourself and your supervising driver.</p>
