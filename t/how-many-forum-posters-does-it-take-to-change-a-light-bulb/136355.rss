1 to move it to the Lighting section

2 to argue then move it to the Electricals section

5 to flame the spell checkers

3 to correct spelling/grammar flames

6 to argue over whether it&#39;s &quot;lightbulb&quot; or &quot;light bulb&quot; ... another 6 to condemn those 6 as stupid

2 industry professionals to inform the group that the proper term is &quot;lamp&quot;

15 know-it-alls who claim they were in the industry, and that &quot;light bulb&quot; is perfectly correct

19 to post that this forum is not about light bulbs and to please take this discussion to a lightbulb forum

11 to defend the posting to this forum saying that we all use light bulbs and therefore the posts are relevant to this forum

4 to post that the URL&#39;s were posted incorrectly and then post the corrected URL&#39;s

3 to post about links they found from the URL&#39;s that are relevant to this group which makes light bulbs relevant to this group

13 to link all posts to date, quote them in their entirety including all headers and signatures, and add &quot;Me too&quot;

5 to post to the group that they will no longer post because they cannot handle the light bulb controversy

4 to say &quot;didn&#39;t we go through this already a short time ago?&quot;

13 to say &quot;do a Google search on light bulbs before posting questions about light bulbs&quot;
