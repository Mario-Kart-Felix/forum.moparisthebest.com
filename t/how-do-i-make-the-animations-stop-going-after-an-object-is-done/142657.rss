    <description>How do I make the animations stop going after an object is done? Like you will keep doing the animation until you logout, So how do I fix this?

Im trying to make it work when you click an object you do an animation, but you keep doing it. How do I make it so you only do it one time?



How can I make emotes only show one time instead of it going and going and going.[br][size=1]Posted on: September 12, 2007, 02:47:13 PM[/size][hr]Does anyone know how?</description>
