    <description>ok im trying to make my weclient and i can get it to load and everything and even dl the cache but the problem is models i have made my own armour and weapons i have also put in the skillcapes and bow to make pplz happy. so i put my model folder my lunar folder and my sprites in my cache along with the mainfile.dat and the .ixd0 - 4. so i run it with .bat and it works; then i run it with my jar and it loads the client and i can log in on anyone not wearing any custom items, but if they are it just laggs and never lets me log in ... any solutions...sry for the long read, lol.</description>
