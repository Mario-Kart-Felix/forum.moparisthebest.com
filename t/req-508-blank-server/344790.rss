    <title>[req] 508 Blank server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-508-blank-server/344790</link>
    <description>i have been looking all over for a blank 508 server and cant find one anywhere. i found a blank 508 but the links are invalid and the person wont make new ones. i used the search bar as well and found nothing.

could someone give me the link for a BLANK 508 server?

help is greatly appreciated (if there is no BLANK 508 server then 317+ will do.)

NOTE: blank meaning all the files are there and it is pre coded but home is at lumbridge no minigames no customs...ect.)

And if anyone could help me with 601 client (601 running on 602 cache) client by hotyute that would help if not then i need a blank 508+ client as well (preferably the highest client available)


NOTE TO MODS: i know requests are not permitted but this should be considered since i cannot find what i am looking for manually or using the search bar (which tbh sucks and needs to stop displaying everything that has 1 word)

ty for help (:</description>
