    <description>Ok well, in boolean &#39;CheckForSkillUse3(int Item, int Slot)&#39; . . Is all my pots.. And food i don&#39;t use.. Because of handler. This is what it looks like..

[code]
	public boolean CheckForSkillUse3(int Item, int Slot) {
		boolean GoOn = true;
		if (server.FoodHandler.HealItem(Item)==true) {
		if (!(duelRule[6] &amp;&amp; duelRule[7])) {
//FoodHandler stuff here..
		} else {
		sendMessage(&quot;Food and drink have been disabled in this duel...&quot;);
		}
		} else
		switch (Item) {
[/code]

duelRule[6], and duelRule[7] is drink and food. Below switch (Item) { is all the cases etc.. Food, drinks, horses, and so on...

&lt;blockquote&gt;if (!(duelRule[6] &amp;&amp; duelRule[7])) {&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It&#39;s basically saying, if its different from that, it doesn&#39;t do below...

But my pots are below, so when you turn off pots in a duel, it turns food off aswell.

When you turn food off, you turn pots off aswell...

Does anyone know how this can be fixed?

I know this is kinda simplish... But its 9:43am .. Just woke up :|..

Would really apreciate help.</description>
