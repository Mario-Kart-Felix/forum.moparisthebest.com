    <description>Feel free to add me on Skype if you have any Web Development questions, needs some help with your server website (or need one), or just want to give some suggestions for this project! Skype username: aj.cordio

Hello Moparscape community, this is a project that I picked back up last night sometimes, and i&#39;ve been working on it quite a bit. Basically i&#39;m re-creating Runescape, except i&#39;m making it browser based. Primarily PHP, whether or not it will be released for open source I have not decided, however it&#39;s a work in progress and it is projected to take a couple more months of good hard work to get it finished. Most of this work is CSS, which is a web development coding language that&#39;s used to basically design the page to however someone may want it. I&#39;m using some to no HTML, another language. And i&#39;ll be primarily using PHP, a scripting language used in Web Development. I&#39;m still planning out some of the details for this game, let me throw out there before any one comments that it is impossible. Why yes, I understand re-creating runescape on a browser is completely impossible as Runescape is Java, and has 3d models and such. This will be TEXT BASED, as appose to graphical, if you have ever heard of Mafia Wars, that is an example of a text based game. I have over 20k Runescape sprites and I plan to use most of them. Soon I will be adding all of the items to databases to create an Item Database, so I can correctly use and set stats for each individual item in runescape currently. I have a few pictures that I&#39;m going to show you below, I will have a quick description of what each picture is.

DISCLAIMER: I understand this greatly involves the Jagex copyright policy, however. I really can only get in trouble if I release it to the public, or make any type of money off of it. I&#39;m going to develop it localhosted, and eventually purchase a domain and upload it to a webhost, in the Jagex copyright it basically says that the sprites and images can be used, as they release them publicly, it just takes a more brighter person to find out how to rip them. I&#39;ve personally contacted Jagex and they confirmed that their policy was correct, and gave me the A-Ok on proceeding with this project. 

With that being said, On with the images.. (Please Note: Images may be large for some)

(About; This is the standard log-in screen that many of you know, and recognize)

(About; I&#39;ve found a nice moving GIF, for the loading screen, so like real Runescape, the &#39;light&#39; spins around the circle)
[img]http://i43.tinypic.com/351tqmx.png[/img]

(About; I&#39;ve worked on this the past two hours, this is laying out the client for images to be added when finished. Please note that this is an actual browser page, and not something made with an image-editing program, this is a couple hundred lines of CSS and some HTML to create this, the colored lines are just a debug for me as the creator, so I can visually see where everything will align. Also, I&#39;ve changed the mini map some, i&#39;ve still included a compass, world map button, health, prayer, and run buttons, it isn&#39;t too hard to determine where they are.)
[IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/2qw1zsy.png[/img]

EDIT: (About; This is just a progressed version of the image above, this is just to show people how I can add in images now and start to build the client, top to bottom, graphical wise.)
[img]http://i45.tinypic.com/2ziww21.png[/img]

EDIT: (About; This ties into the image above this one, this is the inventory basic template, you can see it come together from the image that&#39;s two up.)
[IMG]http://i50.tinypic.com/dcwoxv.png[/img]

EDIT: (About; Added a few more images, i&#39;ll need to re align some of the tabs, but this is how it&#39;s starting to look. Re-alignment should only take a few seconds, a matter of changing some numbers.)
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/2ez32ae.png[/img]

EDIT: (About; I&#39;ve added a few more pictures and re-aligned the inventory tabs, I didn&#39;t get as much done lately because I went on vacation, I came back however and worked for a couple hours and below is the outcome! I may have someone create me something for the minimap area, that looks a bit more appealing, now i&#39;ll be working on the rest of the inventory tabs. And also the first tutorial!)
[IMG]http://i46.tinypic.com/5l2rr4.png[/img]

EDIT: (About; This image is far ahead of the ones above it, the option to start the tutorial and do a couple things before continuing the game. This image primarily shows off the inventory system, I used bronze sword, and iron armor as a test. This gets the users inventory from the MySQL database and translates the id to &#39;$item#&#39; then implements it into an image, it&#39;ll then look for the item in the /items folder, with the item id from the database, being the image name, then adds .png at the end, and displays the information. The image below shows a bit more.)
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/260ap9s.png[/img]

EDIT: Interworkings of the Inventory System..
I&#39;ve gotten three private messages from users who were quite interested on finding out how the inventory system works. So, I&#39;m here to elaborate some. In the inventory container there is a standard grid to hold the items. The item images are stored locally at images/items, where they can easily be accessed at any time. I have a small PHP function that pulls the current users inventory from the database, the database is set up as &quot;username - item1 - item2 - item3&quot; and so on. Within say &#39;item1&#39; the data for that user is 001. This data is sent to another PHP script that pulls up information about the item from a different file, it converts the id 001 (itemid) to the item name, requirements, and stats. Then another script handles this information and puts it into the grid in the inventory,l it shows the items image from the images folder, displays the items name when it&#39;s hovered over, and says some other things, like whether or not it can be equipped to certain slots. Here is a small video.

[size=12pt][b]This information is from my old development thread from months ago, with my other account; which was un-rightfully banned. I&#39;m including this because it has a bit more information to add to this.[/b][/size]
I thought this may be a cool idea to try out, with six years of professional web design on hand, I thought I would attempt to do this myself, considering the fact that I&#39;ve played Runescape quite a bit to re-create it in my browser. Before any confusion, this is NOT a private server, this is a clone / re-create of runescape that is in your browser. Most of us know the game, &quot;Mafia Wars&quot; that was primarily popular on Facebook about a year or two ago, right? That is a browser based MMORPG, some people also call these types of games, &quot;Text Based&quot; games. Before reading further please note the two things. To start, this is not coded in Java, i&#39;m using Html, CSS, Php, MySQL (Main coding languages for web development) and possible some javascript, which is somewhat java coding but different in many ways. And also, note that this isn&#39;t a private server, and this is going to take a while to complete. After its done and I open it in beta mode to about 50 users, i&#39;ll then get all of the bugs out that I can find, and then make the website easy to install for the average Joe, and hopefully release some tutorials on how to edit it. Once again, this is Text / Browser based, no java coding is used for this. 

Now, Moving on.. This thought randomly popped up a couple days ago and I thought it would be pretty cool to try out and see how it works out. I&#39;ve already started coding a few things, please keep in mind that i&#39;m doing everything from scratch, the log-in box looks exactly like runescape except it&#39;s in your browser, like this text that you&#39;re reading, you can click and drag your mouse over it and highlight the text. There will obviously be things that are different, it&#39;s physically impossible to re-create Runescape 2 without using any Java coding, i&#39;ll just throw that out there. The things you do in Runescape, you&#39;ll be able to do on here, in a mafia wars type theme, lets go through an example, front to back, lets say you want to train your woodcutting level..

You&#39;d click the spellbook on the right side of your screen, the minimap and inventory area acts like a minimap, and will follow you to every web page that you go to. Then click the teleport for skilling, you&#39;ll be presented with a short loading screen, and a teleporting &quot;.gif&quot; short animation will show, then you&#39;ll go the the webpage called &#39;skilling.php&#39;. From there, you&#39;ll see a screen with options for different skills, you&#39;d find the tree and click it which will redirect you to the &#39;woodcutting.php&#39; file of the website. On the woodcutting.php file you now need to do some type of work or something to actually get the logs, the logs are then put into your inventory, say the logs have an item id of 600, the .php file will store the log in your MySQL table for the user, under &quot;character_inventory_1&quot; and it will put 600 in the Item_ID column and 1 in the Amount column. Then this will connect with the inventory.php file and tell it to display all of the information in the character_inventory_1 slot and character_inventory_2 slot in the 2nd slot of the inventory, I want to have it set up so that getting a full inventory of logs will give you X Amount of xp per log, and it takes about 4 seconds per log. 

Explaining what i&#39;m working on is somewhat hard to do, you&#39;d have to see it to actually know what i&#39;m talking about, i&#39;ll post a test one in a couple days so that people can create accounts, log-in and possibly some other things. I&#39;ve been working on it for about three hours already, I have almost an exact clone of the log-in screen, the text is somewhat noticeably different, and i have a redirect after log-in page, you&#39;ll log in, and then be presented with a loading screen (what is the runescape loading screen when logging in, and it actually works), I have all of the mouse-overs working aswell, so when you hover your mouse over the log-in button, it will glow like it would in runescape. It&#39;s already set up in full screen and can easily support full screen, however, you can drag your web browser to make it different sizes and play at whatever size you&#39;d like. 

This isn&#39;t going to be all graphic fancy and such, considering the fact that at first i&#39;m recreating it, and making it playable before I worry about HD pictures, and also the fact that this isn&#39;t coded in java and everything is text/browser based. If you don&#39;t know what a browser based game is, you&#39;re really not going to get much of a concept of what i&#39;m talking about, and chances are you wont until I release a test to the community and have people register and log-in. As for now, I have two pictures, what you see in the pictures has taken me about four hours in total, and 35-45 lines of html code, 150 lines of CSS code, and about 250 lines of php code (for the log-in system), and 12 images have been used so far. This first image is the main screen you get when you first go to the website, this log-in screen is almost exact to the runescape log-in screen, yet the amazing thing is, I haven&#39;t used any java while doing so.

After you logged in all that it says for now is, &quot;You have sucessfully logged in, &#39;USERNAME_HERE&#39; &quot; Just so that i know the script actually is working and everything is working now. Now I need to work on the page you&#39;re presented after you&#39;ve logged in, which will be a two column website base, with the sidebar in the right column (where the minimap, health, inventory, and other things are), and the game in the left column, where you&#39;ll be able to train the skills, do the quests, and where your bank will show up and what not. 

Today i&#39;m going to be focusing mainly on that third page after you&#39;ve logged in, primarily the side bar because that&#39;s probably one of the hardest thing to recreate, because there are about 200 active objects and links all in the sidebar, for different tabs, viewing skills, and using all of the teleports and the mage book, re-creating the teleport system will probably be one of the hardest things. You&#39;ll be re-directed to a page when you click a teleport and it will change the info in the MySQL database to say, &quot;Character_Location&quot; 1-50, if you teleport to varrock it may put Character_Location as 2, then the browser reads it and it will re-direct you to the correct page. 

I hope some of you will understand exactly what i&#39;m re-creating after i&#39;ve described it a bit, and hopefully you guys support me so that i can continue in my development, i&#39;m also currently looking for a Graphics Person that can help me along the way with some graphics, let me know if interested. I&#39;ll be updating soon with more posts and probably a test in a few days, so people can log-in

[size=12pt][b]- End Old Development Thread -[/b][/size]

I hope you guys enjoy this thread, I would like your feedback if you have the time, I will have some more pictures up of the client tomorrow sometime, keep checking back as this thread will be updated every few days. I&#39;m taking all suggestions as well, i&#39;ll need as much help as I can get from the community as this is a fairly big project.

Thanks for your time (Sorry for taking your time; if you read the whole thing)! - The Web Guy

[size=12pt]Updates[/size]
[b]Everytime something major is changed it will be posted here.[/b]

- Created inventory template, i&#39;m going to now work on the first item, a toolkit. As well as add the tab icons, next will be laying out the standard 28-item grid in the inventory, and inserting guidelines bits of php for each item, this means I&#39;ll be able to add the item database, with ease.

- Layed the groundwork for inventory tabs, the attack tab, stats, and quests are 80% done.</description>

I’m still curious how you’re going to have the game play. It’s text based correct? So is it just going to be a sequence of screens and buttons? How will the mini-map work?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ll think of some better ways to describe it, the minimap will basically show a section of lumbridge, a section of edge, etc. If you move to a different section, it’ll show a different section of edge. So edgeville may have say 5 sections, you can do different things in each section, if you travel to edgeville via the teleport button in the spellbook tab, it’ll show each section on a bigger map, and say what you’re able to do within each section, you can travel to that section and do those things in that section. Section for thieving in edge, woodcutting, fishing, etc. But it’ll be based on where things are in actual edgeville.</p>

<p>Image fun? I had to align everything and get everything set up to look like an actual client, before I start doing the actual game, if you had any sense with web development you would understand that. It’s exactly like creating a website from scratch, you have to lay out the columns, the header, the footer, etc. And plan where everything is going to be. Then build it, before you can add content to the website.</p>
<p>And also, ‘Continue further and you’ll be feeling it in your wallet.’ Hmm ? This isn’t costing any money, I’m doing this purely for fun, and wish for nothing in return, as I’m not putting money into it. Not sure what you mean by ‘feeling it in my wallet.’</p>
