    <title>Help setting up server on a Dedicated Website</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-setting-up-server-on-a-dedicated-website/289016</link>
    <description>I would like some suggestions to go about setting up EasyRSC onto my Dedicated website.  This host is not running off my personal PC, therefore it&#39;s more complicated than running &quot;run_server&quot;.  While having this hosted on my dedicated host, my server will be able to run 24/7. 

For a start, I am using Cpanel.
My host&#39;s IP is this: 208.87.243.22 (But every time I type this in, it doesn&#39;t connect to anything but an Apache page that my web-host provider has set.)
Any ideas on how to get around this?
I am receiving an error on how it &quot;Cannot assign request address&quot;
Buildfile: build.xml

runls:
[code]java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out: connect[/code]

I am using Xisto Linux as a host.


Any ideas on how to get around this?


I&#39;ve tried to hook this up myself and have had a few buddies try and help me setup it also, but all attempts have failed.
And I really don&#39;t prefer to host any RSC server off my PC as a DDOS may occur.  :S



Also, another option.
We&#39;ve tried to setup RSCDv25 onto a database also, but while trying to connect through my server with the IP I was given, We kept getting &quot;cannot assign requested address&quot;.  Also, we&#39;ve tried using my host&#39;s IP, and that hasn&#39;t worked either.  I know that my settings aren&#39;t incorrect.  It connects to my host&#39;s database just fine.  But when it comes to running the Login Server, it doesn&#39;t connect.

Any suggestions?</description>

<p>I’ve tried that also.<br>
Still get the connection error.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Also, in my server.java file, these are my settings before I compile:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">acceptor.bind(new InetSocketAddress("192.168.0.2", GameVars.portNumber), new RSCConnectionHandler(engine), config);</code></pre>
<p>EDIT:<br>
My suggestion is that some firewall that I am not aware of is blocking the incoming request.</p>

<p>Also, I read your post a few hours ago, the reason why RSCD was big was because there were no other servers out, not because it was invite only. If you think you’re going to get loads of players by making it invite only, you’re horribly mistaken, look at zzgame.[/quote]<br>
Hmm, I understand that.<br>
And we’ve reconsidered that aspect.</p>
<p>Anyways, back on topic.<br>
Hmm, now that I remember, that wasn’t the error I was getting.<br>
“java.net.ConnectException: Connection timed out: connect”</p>
<p>My server was up &amp; everything.<br>
The only way I can connect to it is if I set my settings in setting.ini to 127.0.0.1<br>
I’ve tried port forwarding, etc.  Nothing still.<br>
Also, a few of my friends have tried to setup it through Teamview, still nothing.<br>
This makes me think my PC is refusing connection, So, I disabled my firewall on my modem, along with my PC.<br>
Still…  The same error.</p>
<p>Take in mind, we’ve setup on a friends PC with the same settings, we just edited them so they would connect to his server, and it worked…</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

Bro, to be honest, you should look at the error your getting and its quite obvious what is wrong. Look at what I bolded, it clearly shows that the information you provided for it to connect to is wrong, just try looking at your errors before you post <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
