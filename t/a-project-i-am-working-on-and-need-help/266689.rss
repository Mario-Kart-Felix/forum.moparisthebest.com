    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-project-i-am-working-on-and-need-help/266689</link>
    <description>ok. well 1st. im planning to make some sort of auction place.

1st. i need a command that will teleport me to a like a room that is boxed in and we can start auctioning items. and i want to make that command like ::teleportauction or something.

2nd. a commdand like ::auction (item id) (number of that item) -- this will auction the item up.

3rd. a command like ::bid 1000 --- that would post an offer of 1k for that bid.

4th. and a npc in that room u talk to to get ur cash back.

its gonna be a hard process but we can get to it. i would like all ur help to help me do this.
thanks. bowzer.</description>
