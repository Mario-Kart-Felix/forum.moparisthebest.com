    <description>I was just curious about this...

Would deleting a lot of objects in the Deleteobjects method make your server lag less?

Because i&#39;m making a f2p server, and that would be cool to delete a lot of objects in the members area and make it lag less =)</description>

              <p>uh no not necessarily in a way it might make it lag less. but only if you have like a bajillion objects that the server has to load when a person goes there. and even still all it is, is script space. the smaller your file the better so having less objects could be.</p>
