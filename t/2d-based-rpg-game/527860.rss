    <title>2D-based RPG game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2d-based-rpg-game/527860</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been very interested in programming the past few weeks, and I&#39;ve done several different projects and things to further my knowledge. I have always wanted to create a game, so I started off with a text-based game that used Swing to add functionality to the game. Unfortunately, design patterns and even the reasoning behind the game started to become a problem, so I decided to move onto something bigger, a game powered by a 2D engine. Progress has been pretty good lately, and I&#39;m slowly learning all of the features that my current 2D engine offer (Slick2D). 

Here is a screenshot to show an example of the game so far:
[img]http://gyazo.com/cd4c61c83afca1ccb65910fd339aba97.png[/img]
The game currently supports:

[ul][li]Character moving[/li]
	[li]Map loading[/li]
	[li]Collision detection[/li]
	[li]Animations[/li][/ul]

These features work, and no bugs have been found yet, but the overall design and functionality of them are most definitely going to be changed around in the future. If you are interested in seeing how everything is handled, you can check at look at my repository:
[url=https://github.com/voidar/legious]https://github.com/voidar/legious[/url]


I know this game is nothing special, but I have really enjoyed developing it so far, and I hope to continue doing do. If anyone thinks they would like to join in on the development of this game, and you have a understanding of Java (and possibly Slick2D), feel free to post below.</description>

I was speaking for design patterns as a whole, but those related to the former game, which was suppose to be text-based; however, it started turning into something much more, which is why I decided that previous ideas were redundant for the task at hand.</p>

              <p>I have updated the way maps are loaded, which will make things such as collision detection an easier thing to work on. The past system relied on a coordinate based detection, while the new one actually checks a tile’s property via an XML file. I’m still running into a lot of design complications, but I hope to get past these issues as fast as possible.</p>

The game looks bad so far. I realize the artwork is not final, but you’ve got 3 different styles of art going on. The grass is very simple and plain, the character is detailed and upscaled, and the font is anti-aliased. None of it fits together. Stick to one style and it’ll easily look better.<br>

That’s funny because Flash is hardly “web-based” development.  It can be standalone too, yano!  Also for mobile devices, etc.</p>
<p>But, if you have a slight grasp of Java, you have an even greater grasp of ActionScript.</p>

<p>And I will suggest flash because this is a perfect application for such (unless you use Firefox, given that Firefox has yet to fix that huge 1gb+ memory usage issue).</p>
<p>If the contents of the original post concluded that this was something he planned on releasing as a full fledged game, then hell yeah I’d tear this guy a new one.  But obviously the trippy as fudge (stare at it, I dare you) background wouldn’t be suitable for anything worth producing.</p>

<p>I’m completely aware of it, and I’m glad that you are giving criticism; however, the artwork is not something I’m completely worried about at the moment. The sprites are from different things, and are not meant to go together, but I will definitely rework the art when the time comes.</p>

The game looks bad so far. I realize the artwork is not final, but you’ve got 3 different styles of art going on. The grass is very simple and plain, the character is detailed and upscaled, and the font is anti-aliased. None of it fits together. Stick to one style and it’ll easily look better.<br>
[/quote]Focusing on artwork and sprites at the beginning of a project is a surefire way to never finish it.[/quote]That’s true, but I didn’t want to look at the code. After doing so, I have a <span class="bbcode-b">lot</span> to say about the engine, but I think it’s better if I just leave it at something simple that can visibly make a difference.</p>

              <p>I’ve been very interested in programming the past few weeks, and I’ve done several different projects and things to further my knowledge. I have always wanted to create a game, so I started off with a text-based game that used Swing to add functionality to the game. Unfortunately, design patterns and even the reasoning behind the game started to become a problem, so I decided to move onto something bigger, a game powered by a 2D engine. Progress has been pretty good lately, and I’m slowly learning all of the features that my current 2D engine offer (Slick2D).</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot to show an example of the game so far:<br>
<img src="http://gyazo.com/cd4c61c83afca1ccb65910fd339aba97.png" alt width="642" height="484"><br>
The game currently supports:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Character moving[/li]<br>
[li]Map loading[/li]<br>
[li]Collision detection[/li]<br>
[li]Animations[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>These features work, and no bugs have been found yet, but the overall design and functionality of them are most definitely going to be changed around in the future. If you are interested in seeing how everything is handled, you can check at look at my repository:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/voidar/legious" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/voidar/legious</a></p>
<p>I know this game is nothing special, but I have really enjoyed developing it so far, and I hope to continue doing do. If anyone thinks they would like to join in on the development of this game, and you have a understanding of Java (and possibly Slick2D), feel free to post below.</p>
