    <title>Any way to bring this back?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-way-to-bring-this-back/430859</link>
    <description>Majority of people here probally dont actually remember things like this, But back in RSC when there was not bots that displayed players &#39;&#39;pid&#39;&#39; to find if you had catch on certain players you would have to test it out on your buddys.

For example im &#39;&#39;player1&#39;&#39; my friend is &#39;&#39;player2&#39;&#39; now if i was to click follow &#39;&#39;player2&#39;&#39; and would follow 2 squares behind then i would not have catch on this player meaning if he was to retreat during a fight and i was to attempt to catch him, it just would not respond, now if i was to follow this player and i was 3 squares behind then this meens i had catch on this player and when he was to retreat from a fight i could catch him. Now if i was to logout i would probally lose &#39;&#39;pid&#39;&#39; over him and more than likely he would now gain catch over me and visa versa. 

Is there any chance we can intergrate this into Mopar, This has always been how the catching system worked in RSC and still is to this day. 

Unlike private servers were we all have catch over one another?</description>

              <p>It wasn’t a “bug”. It was purposely implemented. Lower PID server sided would be priority followed by the next PID. There is a runefest video which explains exactly why they created the PID system and its intentions… but they realized that if they reverted the PID rotation (lowest to highest --&gt; highest to lowest) Say you were PID 2 and fighting two people (1 and 3) your packets were still second place and thus unfair. So the overall system was abandoned. I like the current system. Like I said… whoever clicks first plays first and seems more fair. Or id just idle till I have the best PID and be leet.</p>
