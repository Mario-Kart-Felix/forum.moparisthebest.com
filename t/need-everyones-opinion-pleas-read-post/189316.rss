    <title>Need everyones opinion! - pleas read &amp; post</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-everyones-opinion-pleas-read-post/189316</link>
    <description>First of all before I talk about what I want to say is that I posted this here for my new site skin that I am making &amp; only reason is because I want to know all the FAQ&#39;s about a moparscape server development team interest. I haven&#39;t finished the site in my sig in case someone wants to ask a question about that either. Anyways:

I am asking everyone in the mopar community about what pages do you think development teams feature. For a hint on what I am saying, what pages do you think should also be added to the site? Such as pages referring to our team members, about us, our products, job offers, our games - beside those what other pages should we add?

Thanks for your opinion by the way - I really need this opinion so much... also here is a sneak peak of my site in development:
