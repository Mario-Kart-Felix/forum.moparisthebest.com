    <description>Alright so I can connect to the server from my client but no one else can I change the &quot;server listeing on (IP here)&quot; and the ports are good 43594 and I changed the client Ip. I&#39;m extremely rusty havn&#39;t done this in over a year, I seem to remember something about changing to online mode in the server.java but im not sure any one got any ideas?

PS I forgot to add its an error connecting to server when you log in</description>
