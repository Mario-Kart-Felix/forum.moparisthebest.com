              <p>Well,  I dont have time to play but I will support your security.  RSC has always been a hate jealous filled section.  I’ve known smoke for 14 years and hes a great guy to have running things.  He did great on <a href="http://Rscheatnet.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Rscheatnet.com</a> and both my <a href="http://rs2cheating.com/us" rel="nofollow noopener">rs2cheating.com/us</a> I helped run.  Funniest thing is I know from a couple of my friends who played JustPK who bug abused,  Shame they wish to come to a forum as if they’ve done nothing.  Well, As in life there is always bigger fish in the sea.  Some of us work within a field little skiddys try to fight in… Shame really… Ruins the idea of the game to have such muppets about… Cheating and getting cought only to try spin the blame off.  Typical nolife childish acts.</p>
<p>I wonder how they would react if it happend to them.  Run a free game for people who think its funny to mess with it.  What goes around comes around is a phrase ive always liked.</p>
<p>Why people need to cause trouble is beyond me… Dont agree with how other people do what they are doing? Just shut your faggot mouths.  What other people do doesnt effect you, its nothing to do with you.  It dont effect your day to day existence so why get involved?  Just proves a point that your really are no life faggots with nothing better to do than try cause bullshit… Dickheads always get shot down, by someone or other… Just stfu move on with your lives and stop thinking you have the right to try sabotage people… Because your the very same morons who when it happens back to you… Run to forums and QQ more.</p>

</aside>
<p>if u think that mopar forums are irrelevant than why keep responding to a post here?  If you don’t care about advertising, what will you do to keep your game from dying?</p>
<p>Mopar is the biggest rsc community, other forums you will get very few people if any and by saying mopar is irrelevant makes me think your a young twat who puts up a server just for recognition and nothing else. This is why rsc is dying, people like you who put up a server, bash the community and then take it down. Trust is a big part in running a server yet the more you talk, the more you show who you really are.</p>
<p>you’re not gonna win against trolls yet you keep trying.<br>

<p>I have nothing to prove, mopar is shit most of the people here are downy twats like you. I’ll still throw an advert up here purely just because I can. The fact that you seem to be so fascinated by me and my project is a real compliment.</p>
<p>The fact that you think mopar is “the biggest” way to gain players is proof enough that you don’t know what the hell you are talking about.</p>

<p>I’m not fascinated by you, I’m “drawn in” by the fact you post on forums that you hate hoping to get people and show your hate through your posts.  If you could be more “adult” like and not put the community down that u advertise on, you may see more people than the 10-20 you will get when you come back up.</p>
<p>Going from easyrsc to a New source that isnt “easy” takes you a week? look at a guide to set up a server, you can get one up in a day. I have released some guides in-case you need help <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,665482.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,665482.0.html</a></p>
<p>theres some tools/guides i re-uploaded from awhile ago that will help you get you on your way.</p>

<p>if u think that mopar forums are irrelevant than why keep responding to a post here?  If you don’t care about advertising, what will you do to keep your game from dying?</p>
<p>Mopar is the biggest rsc community, other forums you will get very few people if any and by saying mopar is irrelevant makes me think your a young twat who puts up a server just for recognition and nothing else. This is why rsc is dying, people like you who put up a server, bash the community and then take it down. Trust is a big part in running a server yet the more you talk, the more you show who you really are.</p>
