    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-fixing-459-mapdata/355602</link>
    <description>Ok I&#39;m new to this client stuff i never made my own client or anything like this so i need help fixing 459 [PJA] mapdata because my client had 317 mapdata , now i have the 459 data and it have some obv bugs in it, like in building paths , patches, missing objects and many more, so i&#39;m wondering if someone can help me how to learn to fix these stuff or give a basic tut that i can keep on from that point, Ok there was the Warrior guild that was missing i downloaded the mapdata fix and all objects got fixed, and now i went wildy the wild ditch [line] was buggy too like looks only black line, how i can fix it that it becomes a normal ditch?
and some buildings are glitched like varrock museum , church and many.

EDIT: TAKING PICS for example.

Thanks.</description>
