&lt;blockquote&gt;Obama has been known frequently to fictionalize aspects of his own life. During his 2008 campaign, for instance, Obama claimed that his dying mother had fought with insurance companies over coverage for her cancer treatments. 
That turned out to be untrue, but Obama has repeated the story--which even the Washington Post called &quot;misleading&quot;--in a campaign video for the 2012 election.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Who knows what to believe anymore lol. Hes almost out though!</description>

Pwnd: Yes diesel is better in CO[sub]2[/sub] emissions, but is worse when it comes to NO[sub]2[/sub], something that you doesn’t want to much of in a city.

<p>Yeah cause a diesel puts out like 0.001g/km of NOx gases. It’s all a scam set up by retarded hipster greenies cause they wanted a job.[/quote]<br>
So explain how why some Norwegian cities had big problems with NO[sub]2[/sub] this winter? With fine headlines like “Most polluted city in Europe” and warnings about going outside because of the high levels of NO[sub]2[/sub].</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
The numbers is found was 1.5 gram per kilometre in -7 C the first 3.7 km with a cold engine. 1 gram per km with a warm engine. Stop getting your facts from FOX news. The car that was tested was a Toyota Avensis 2-litre. I begin to doubt your facts in the milk discussion and not only your opinions.</p>
