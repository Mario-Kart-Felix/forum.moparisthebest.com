We should have freedom when it makes sense, allowing people to sell risky food is not making any sense.<br>
[/quote]If cared for properly, it’s not risky. [/quote]</p>
<p>no matter how much care the CONSUMER puts into storing the milk properly, raw milk can still be contaminated as early as the cow being milked, pasteurisation kills anything harmful in the milk before it is bottled ensuring that at the time of bottling it is guaranteed to be safe to drink</p>
<p>I really just want to stress that the issue with raw milk is that if it is contaminated as the cow is being milk or from the container used to store it etc this contamination will exist until the consumer drinks it, and since milk isn’t typically prepared in any way the only defence stopping you from getting ill is your immune system</p>
<p>and just for the record, I’m all for it being legal for sale, that is, from farm distributors that get it from certified farms only, and provided it has adequate warning labels on it to distinguish it from regular milk</p>

<p>no matter how much care the CONSUMER puts into storing the milk properly, raw milk can still be contaminated as early as the cow being milked, pasteurisation kills anything harmful in the milk before it is bottled ensuring that at the time of bottling it is guaranteed to be safe to drink[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>In New Zealand, the milk goes straight from the cow to the tank via the milk line and milk pump, there are no “containers” in between.</li>
<li>If a cow is sick, it’s milk is milked straight into a bucket and disposed of. The cow is given a round of anti-biotics and is only allowed back into the milking herd after a set time, ie 4 days.</li>
<li>The quality of the milk is tested every day as it is picked up, the farmer receives a receipt which states milk quantity, Somatic Cell Count (The cow produces more of these when she is sick or when she is old, it can make the milk taste different), milk fat content, milk solid content, protein content, bacteria test results, sediment test results and other items.</li>
<li>The bulk milk tank must be washed twice with hot water and acid before any milk is added to it. After every milking, 20-45 minutes is spent washing the entire shed with either acid or alkaline solution (alkaline is every 4th day). The wash water must be at least 80 degrees celcius by the time it has gone through the system.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is not guaranteed to be safe, but there is only a very very little chance of it being unsafe.<br>
If the SCC rating of the milk exceeds a certain value, the milk company stops picking it up straight away and the farmer gets a large fine. If any penicillin is found in the milk, the farmer gets a huge fine. If the temperature of the milk is above 7 degrees celcius at the time of pick up, the farmer gets a huge fine. If there is too much water in the milk, the farmer gets a huge fine. Any issues with the farm are resolved quick smart.</p>
<p>My uncle’s cows have the second highest quality milk in all of NZ, and probably quite high up there in relation to the rest of the world. The milk from my dad’s cows is not quite as high quality but it has never gotten anyone sick, so meh…</p>

<p>'Nuff said. In most instances it wont be dangerous but the fact of the matter is it CAN be dangerous. No matter how low the risk is once you supply to a large enough population people will get sick occasionally. Even if only 0.0001% of a sample of 1 million people drank your milk and got sick that’s still 1 person. Now, I pulled those stats out of thin air obviously, but the point stands - minimising risk is vastly important and when there is no disadvantage to not doing something that improves safety it seems truly stupid to not bother with it. (And I reckon 0.0001% is being rather generous but I could be wrong)</p>
<p>You could live on a farm your entire life drinking raw milk and never get sick, maybe its safe, or maybe you already developed a stronger immune system for it as a kid. However it seems idiotic to bet that the rest of the population will have the same luck, all in the name of “freedom”.</p>
<p>EDIT: I just have to comment on the argument that people have drank raw milk for centuries, I think Niall has made all the necessary points but I’m just hoping you do realise up until modern hygiene standards were introduced people were probably getting sick from raw milk all the time or do people forget that most children never used to live past around 5, and the life expectancy was well under half of what it is today.</p>

        <p>A translation of the Dutch Wikipedia page about legislation of raw milk in the Netherlands:</p>
<p>“Because the Dutch livestock is TBC-free, the sale of raw milk is allowed. The VWA (Dutch FDA) thinks it’s unwise to consume raw milk, and there have been cases of people getting sick in the 21st century. Sickness was caused by campylobacter and salmonella. Farmers are allowed to sell raw milk because buyers are expected to boil the milk before consumption.”</p>
<p>Two-thirds don’t actually boil the milk though. But these people know what they are doing, and are willing to take the risk. The average consumer buying groceries in a supermarket has no idea what risks they are taking when buying raw milk.</p>

So what you are saying is that since there is a 99.8% chance a person will be involved in an automobile accident in their lifetime, driving should be banned? I guess you are all for self driving cars? I guess you are all for a boring future where everyone is a useless shit that sits in front of a computer all day, hops into a self driving bus to go home to their one bedroom apartment, drinks some distilled water, eats some soylent green and then goes to bed only to repeat this for the rest of their lives?<br>
In a future like this, I would rather have died at age 5 from a sickness as this future would suck arse. Like it or not, it is natural for many of a species to die before they reach adulthood. We are only evolved to live approximately 35 years. After that we begin to break down, our bones become porous, our hearts get weaker, our muscles begin to degenerate. The fact that must be faced is that if we don’t start dying younger, the world will become over populated very soon. Food supplies will become insufficient and many people will starve.</p>
<p>tl;dr, either let people start dying younger, impose birth limitations on people or have a shitty fucked up future where noone actually has any fun.</p>
<p>edit: Also, now that I think about it, it would be far better to get sick in a controlled environment from something such as milk as this will help build up your immune system. If there were to be a major natural disaster and you were cast into a completely unsafe environment, your chances of getting sick would go through the roof. If you had actually played outside as a child, eaten dirt, not washed your hands, had raw milk and gotten sick, you will have a far stronger immune system than if you had never done those things as a child. You would have a minuscule chance of survival in a harsh world after a huge disaster. So basically, be my guest and be a little bitch at the moment, it just means I will have more of the world to myself after.<br>
-Just look at indians living in the slums, they often live past their 50’s (unlike many Americans). They have built up a very strong immune system compared to us. I bet that if you went to India and spent a month or so in the slum conditions you would get very sick and they would just laugh at you.</p>

        <p>How many people die a year from alcohol? Perhaps we should boil all alcohol so there is no alcohol in it to harm people. How many people get injured from marijuana in some way or another? Perhaps you stupid stoners could stop smoking weed and drinking alcohol, those are far worse for you than raw milk. Don’t even get me started on cigarettes or coffee.</p>
<p>You guys are the most retarded fuckwits in the world. You have no life, you are complete failures. You cannot handle the fact that there is no logical reason to ban the sale of raw milk. You may as well just let the government tell you what time to wake up, what to eat for breakfast, where to work, what time of the day you need to take shits. You do not have the ability to think for yourself and have an urge to be led by others. Idiots.</p>
