        <p>as frell pointed out cigarettes have warning labels and cannot be sold to minors, some proponents of raw milk want it to be sold in supermarkets along with regular milk and despite how many labels you slap on it, someone is bound to unknowingly buy raw milk and get ill from it unnecessarily(the current situation in some states is that raw milk can only be sold by farm distributors is infinitely more preferable than super markets selling it, and the route that the uk takes where only licensed farms can sell it, with adequate warning labels is even more preferable)</p>
<p>my main gripe is proponents of raw milk who want it sold in super markets or easily accessible, and especially with people who make the false claim that it’s a healthier alternative to children because of the nutritional difference, infants and children are the ones most susceptible to the ill health effects of raw milk and while I don’t want to make the “please think of the children argument”, allowing raw milk to be sold in super markets or under the guise that it’s healthier than pasteurised milk is extremely irresponsible and unnecessary, especially since the nutritional difference is insignificant at best, and even with the nutritional value considered there exists such a thing as filtered milk that doesn’t have the ill health effects of raw milk but has the same nutritional value</p>
<p>tl;dr it’s fine for ron paul to support raw milk but it’s extremely idiotic and some proponents of raw milk are down right irresponsible with their claims</p>

<p>Ron Paul’s whole deal is that people should make their own decisions, not the federal government.  So, if you don’t agree with some of his policies and you happen to be part of the majority, he won’t follow through with it.  That’s how it’s supposed to be.</p>
<p>The states are supposed to take care of most of the legislation.  That’s where he makes sense.</p>

        <p>I dont think its wrong for the federal government to protect the ignorant population from their own stupidity brought on by media exposure, niall said people claim its healthier, when it really isn’t and that is a problem. In fact, Nutella was recently sued by a mother and she won $5M. She claimed the Nutella commercials made the food look like a healthy choice but it was not at all.</p>
<p>At least with smoking the damage really starts taking a toll on you over time. One glass of organic milk could kill a small child if you get a really bad batch.</p>

<p>I’ve lived on a farm for my entire life and the only milk I drink is straight from the cow or from the filter between the cow and the vat. Milk is perfectly safe to drink if the cows have been fed properly and not filled with the garbage that you american’s feed your cows. Instead of making it illegal to sell raw milk, make it illegal to feed your cows fucking crappy food that makes them get sick, make it illegal to factory farm the cows, don’t make it illegal to sell raw milk.<br>
People have lived thousands of years drinking raw cow milk. If your child dies from raw milk, tough. It’s called natural selection, without it we will all be retarded failures within the next few hundred years. People who live in town these days are pretty much all useless and don’t deserve the air they breathe. Air contains many pathogens and is far more likely to kill you than milk but you don’t see any legislation saying that you can only breathe air out of a bottle which has been sterilized.</p>

That won’t happen though, because corporations run everything. If such laws were to be put in place, the price would go up, and there’s not enough idealists out there to ever make it happen. People are stupid cretin and would take convenience and low prices over ecological and lasting solutions.</p>

        <p>You do know that I am not against pasteurization, right? I am just against it being illegal to sell unpasteurized milk. I am also against cows being fed absolute crap. They should at least have the right to eat fresh grass in a paddock, considering they give their lives just to feed us. My family’s 300 cows are all very healthy and very rarely ever need veterinary attention, some get mastitis but that is normal and is very quickly remedied. The beef from our cows is of high enough quality to be eaten raw, I would not say the same of grain fed cows which spend the majority of their lives in a shed.</p>

        <p>i don’t really know all too much about this topic, but i think you all are treating runescape3dude a little harshly - raw food isn’t a bad thing if it’s handled properly, but corporations will most likely not do this (i know). why not require the farms that wish to sell non-pasteurized milk to place a label on this product? i don’t think paul is against eliminating the FDA…</p>

<p>I guess you could allow the sale of raw milk as long as the milk is sold at the farm. But you can’t sell it in a supermarket.</p>
