    <title>Maple Story and Server [Urgent?]</title>

    <description>Don&#39;t post if you&#39;ve know clue what things like a RunServer are..

Okay, I&#39;m just asking is it bad to run my server - not actual MoparScape, just the DOS-like runserver thing so people can play on my server without me having to be on it.
Is it bad to run it while I also have up on my screen (full) Maple Story which is another Online game?

~~~~~~~~~~~
if you&#39;re wondering why I ask this then read:

I got bored and me and some friends decided to play some other online game.

So here&#39;s the thing, when I was playing sometimes it minimizes [it&#39;s a full screen game]
When I&#39;m on the desktop either my RunServer is just gone outa&#39; nowhere or I look in it and see the server crashed.

If I try and start it back up right after it quickly closes saying something with &quot;Fatal Error&quot;
If I exit Maple Story and start it up it works fine and I can turn Maple back on again.

Anyone know why it does this and if it&#39;s safe to run both?..

Help extremely appreciated =D</description>
