    <title>474? how to remove extra teleportation options?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/474-how-to-remove-extra-teleportation-options/440215</link>
    <description>ok so u know how when u click minigame teleport it comes up with options in the chat box of a bunch of minigames? i want to remove that so that when u click on the teleport it takes u directly too 1 place only. like regular teleporting 

i tried from clicking buttons but when i removed the options all it did was either give a list with no options and the teleports didnt work then or the teleport wouldnt work at all and nothing would happen?

any step by step instructions? thanks ill rep</description>
