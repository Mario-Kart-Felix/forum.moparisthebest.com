              <p>I’d say go for it. Your first server is bound to have a ton of mess ups anyway. Everyone has to start somewhere, why not? I would recommend it just because it’s a good learning experience to go through a few times.</p>
<p>I don’t think you’ll get flamed for posting a development thread as long as you follow the rules of it. The main reason why people get flamed there isn’t because their server sucks, it’s just because they refuse to pay attention to how they’re supposed to post. Anyways, good luck if you do decide to.</p>

Also, if you’re ever facing people being unconstructive and posting things such as “this sucks” or “you won’t get far”, you can just report the post to a moderator. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
