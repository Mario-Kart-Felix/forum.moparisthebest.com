    <description>How do I fix the food?

I was editing my server and compiling every so often so that I could see were the errors where and in the end I got no errors so it&#39;s all ok. Then I tried pking, I went to eat but my health didn&#39;t increase and the manta was still in my inventory.

I don&#39;t remember which parts of my server I removed.

Could someone please tell me how to get the food working again please? :)</description>
