    <description>Alright,
I&#39;ve been playing rs roughly since late &#39;01, and I&#39;ve never really been aware of this side of the Rs community until now. I don&#39;t even know what half the stuff listed on the forums are, if even that. 

So, could you guys be so kind as to introduce a new member into whole new world?

For example:
Who/what is mopar?
Whats aryan and scar?
Rs has hacks?
etc.

I know this might be in the wrong forum, but as it seems to get the most attention, maybe I&#39;ll get better answers to all my questions.


Thanks for reading,
