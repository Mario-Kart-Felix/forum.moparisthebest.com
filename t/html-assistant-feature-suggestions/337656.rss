    <title>HTML Assistant (Feature suggestions)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/html-assistant-feature-suggestions/337656</link>
    <description>I am in the process of creating an HTML Editor. I want to know, if you were coding HTML, what are some features you would want in such a program? I have 3 main ones that I am working on as you read this, but I would like some of your idea&#39;s.

If you would like to know what my HTML Assistant already has, even thought it is really basic right now, check out the Project thread in the C# section of my website.

Current Idea&#39;s
[ul][*]CoonHunter - FTP Support
[*]CoonHunter - Syntax Highlighting
[*]CoonHunter - Line counting (on the side of text area)
[*][s]Pure2Ownage - &#39;Instant&#39;-Script[/s] - Decided not to do
[*][s]Davidi2 - Snippets[/s] - Finished/Still progressing[/ul]


Please, either discuss, or suggest. No spamming.

What im doing now:
[ul][*]Nothing, I need idea&#39;s that can be basic features before I do the more advanced stuff.[/ul]

These sound the same, and in general are, but I will make them different, like &#39;Instant&#39;-Script gives you a custom dialog, and you input the information needed. For snippets, It will basically be a &#39;lookup&#39; for some sample codes.</description>

<p>I suggest adding snippets, and other things. For example, have an option to insert an image, then a popup that asks for the image location, and then it inserts the image code.</p>

<p>Alright, I will add some custom Dialog’s on having a script. Shouldn’t be a problem.</p>

<p>I think the syntax highlighting helps developers in a small way, so they can find peices of code faster. The reason I am making an HTML specific program is because i need to for pracice. If i can successfully complete this, then adding more languages to it wont be hard.</p>
