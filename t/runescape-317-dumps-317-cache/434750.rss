    <title>RuneScape 317 Dumps + 317 Cache</title>

    <description>Hello MoparScape,

[b]Note: This is for Emulous.[/b]

Me and my friend Skyru are making an Emulous project. We will be using a Project Insanity client and an Emulous Base (Not PI but the server PI is based from.)

It would be a lot of help if you guys could please post the follows dumps, or links to where people have posted these dumps.

100% RuneScape Shop Dump (317)
100% RuneScape NPC Dump (317)
100% RuneScape Spawn-Config Dump (317)
100% RuneScape Object Dump (317)
100% RuneScape Item Dump (317)

We don&#39;t want any items in the server that aren&#39;t from the 317 revision.

Also, does anyone have a 100% 317 - 377 Cache? We also want to get a 317 gameframe, so if any of yuo have links to these it would be helpful because I&#39;ve looked myself and can&#39;t seem to find any.

Thanks,

Skyro!</description>
