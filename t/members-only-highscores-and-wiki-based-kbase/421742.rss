    <description>http://services.runescape.com/m=news/coming-next-week-new-website

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Other News...

- Along with the release of the new website, we will be making hi-scores a members-only feature.

This is for a number of reasons, but the main one is to keep them fresh. We want the hiscores to feature players who will compete with each other, tooth and nail, for hiscore glory. There are many dormant accounts within the hiscores that have not played for a very long time, and this will give new arrivals in Gielinor a shot at hiscore fame alongside the grizzled veterans on equal terms for all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I thought this was pretty interesting. I was sort of upset because of all the people that have earned 200m stats and are in the top 20 or so, but have long since quit. I asked and they will lose their rank, but if they become members again, they will go back to the rank they were at, and not the end of the 200m list.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The old manual has been transplanted into a new, wiki-based format and will form the core of the new website. With the exception of a few key pages maintained solely by Jagex staff, these pages can be edited, and visual assets can be uploaded, by RuneScape account holders who meet certain baseline requirements. In you, we have an amazing community, from those with a decade of RuneScape experience and knowledge to fresh new faces, and with this change we’re empowering all of you to pool that RuneScape nous for the community to use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The good old kbase is being converted into a wiki :)

&lt;blockquote&gt;With the exception of a few key pages maintained solely by Jagex staff, these pages can be edited, and visual assets can be uploaded, [b]by RuneScape account holders who meet certain baseline requirements.[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My guess is it&#39;ll be just like the forums, you&#39;ll be able to receive mutes/bans if you vandalize.</description>

You still didn’t help your argument, $92 is still a good hunk of money to find out if you even like endgame. And last I checked amazons expansion prices were the same as <a href="http://wow.com" rel="nofollow noopener">wow.com</a>[/quote]<br>
£59 isn’t a large amount of money, infact it’s only slightly more expensive than console copies of new games like BF3, also prices on <a href="http://battle.net" rel="nofollow noopener">battle.net</a> for wotlk+cata are around £40 each.</p>

<p>Sigh, meant 155*</p>
<p>Supposedly the fun thing about WoW is raiding, and you either like it or you don’t.</p>
<p>So lets see.</p>
<p>About 2 months casual playing to 70, experimenting with classes and seeing what you like. -$30-$60</p>
<p>Buy wotlk - $40<br>
Another month to 80 - $15<br>
Buy Cataclysm - $40<br>
Another few weeks to 85 - $15</p>
<p>Yay time to raid!!</p>
<p>This is horrible, good thing I only spent… $155…</p>
<p>yay…</p>
<p>Blizzard is full of dickheads to let this happen. Seeing as how it is all buffer/timey content until the supposed “fun” comes. They make you pay to find out if you like their game.</p>

<p>but thats the thing you said most had left the game either been banned or stopped goldfarming because of bots disabled. This is false, I have a student that works in a gold farming company afterschool and yes some accounts had been banned but most have not. The bosses of these companies are actually happy because the removal of bots increased the price per mill. the truth is Jagex is bullshitting just how much the gold farming influenced the player count.</p>
