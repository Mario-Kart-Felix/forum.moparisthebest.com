    <title>Cache updater for 317, I pay you 5 dollar if you get it to work</title>

    <description>Hello everyone.
I want to create a cache updater for my server.
You know what I mean the Searching updates on startup thing.
I want to have an updater in my client so whenever I have a new model it downloads the new cache automatically. I don&#39;t care if it redownloads the full cache.
Does anyone know how to do that?
I have seen lots of servers who do it. But i never found a tutorial on it.
I hope someone can help me thanks in advance, Artegoworld owner 
I will pay anyone who can get this to work 5 dollar with paypal. ;D
Ps I think it&#39;s done in signlink.java in my server, I just can&#39;t get it to work and there are no tuts.</description>

              <p>I know that the problem is that it downloads the cache on another spot than, and I don’t want my users to have to download more than 1 cache. It should also delete the previous cache. Btw it doesn’t matter if there is a new download link in client.jar, because the client already knows where the previous cache is and won’t redownload it on the same spot.<br>
EDIT: You are right, I should just reupload and increase the cache version, thank you!<br>
Ps If you want I give you some money because you made me realise that, what’s your paypal?</p>
