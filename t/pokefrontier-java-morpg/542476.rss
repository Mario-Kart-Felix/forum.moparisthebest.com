Hey guys im currently working on a pokemong orpg using JavaFX the thread is currently under construction until i find a graphics designer

Pokemon Frontier will start off with the Orange Islands series as GameFreak has never created a rom off of that season i have decided to make the game interesting by starting there, the game will be based off of BP (BattlePoints) With these battle points you will be able to unlock a road to finding great treasures and legendary pokemon, throughout the game once reaching the end you will find the Battle Frontier which will be a competitive region itself filled with the strongest trainers out there!

This entire project is an eyesore. For the love of god, please choose one graphical style and stick to it. Stop using smoothed high-resolution 32-bit-color text with a translucent background on top of pixelated low-resolution 16-bit-color graphics. Your icons at the top… None of them are remotely alike. The first one is smooth and looks like a rendered model. Next you have a jagged sprite, followed by a stretched low-res chat bubble, a high-quality sprite, a shrunken map, and then a custom icon with an arrow that doesn’t match anything else.</p>
<p>Then there’s the quality of everything else. The character’s animation not resetting when its walk cycle stops, the battle status images in arbitrary locations with respect to the battle scene and each other, the HP bar having a transparent empty bar (what happens when the background is green, red, or yellow?), the background battle image looking like it’s been compressed, some Pokemon sprites or models being stretched while others aren’t, the battle GUI lacking borders (seriously, the top line of the bottom box isn’t even straight…)… I could go on and on.</p>
<p>I understand this is a work-in-progress, but my god man, I’ve made a Pokemon clone and it’s not that hard, especially since you can rip the graphics and copy designs from the games! Ugh, I really don’t understand why all Pokemon MORPGs end up looking the way this one does.<br>

There isn’t a graphic designer in the team so any images you see are most likely picked from a random source. It’s illegal to use the regular Pokemon sprites.[/quote]<br>
Actually it’s not. Nintendo condones and loves fan games, it is however to use the Pokemon sprites in the context of a ROM because of the usage (they’ve explicitly stated this many times)</p>

              <p>[quote=“508Reject, post:31, topic:542476”]Thank you! If you have any suggestions for <span class="bbcode-s">the battle</span> <span class="bbcode-b">ALL</span> GUI they are welcomed![/quote]I nitpick these kinds of things. There is too much blank space for just an HP bar. Maybe if you had added a little more info in it (such as; the name of the Pokemon you’re fighting &amp; the level of it), there wouldn’t be as much blank space. I suggest making it more vertical than horizontal. I’m not sure what the right-hand side, Pokemon ball, blank slate is - but I assume it’s for the Pokemon you have in your belt. Depending on how spaced out they will be from one another, that looks fine, other than I believe it could be expanded just a bit larger (both vertically and horizontally). And what I mean by this is the Pokemon, not the slate itself. The text is a bit hard to read, but that may come from the resolution I am viewing it at. However, I still feel like there should be less blank space on the right-hand side of this slate, to make it equal on both sides and look less tacky. You should also add more of a border, like black lines and such. The images just seem to collide with each other, and it makes the switch between the two just unbearable to look at. And… Must I say anything about the action bar? The text in it isn’t even aligned in the center properly. As well as everything else, really. Nothing is aligned properly, every element has disoriented blank spaces, and not equal on each side. Now, there can be some cases where it works out like that, but not in this case. Such as your action buttons. I will say one thing, I do like the font you used for your names and chat box, but please do something about the font in your action buttons.</p>
<p>That’s all! I hope you take some of what I said and jot it in your notes! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>As a side note: This looks absolutely amazing, I will definitely be playing this if it’s as good as it looks.</p>
