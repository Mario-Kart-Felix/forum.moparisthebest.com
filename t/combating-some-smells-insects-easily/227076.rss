    <description>[CENTER][B]Tips for combating some specific smells. [size=1pt]- by ZeroFreeze - www.moparisthebest.com/smf[/size][/B][/CENTER]

[B][U]-- Combating smells --[/U][/B]

[B]Ew, garlic![/B]
If you ate food with a lot of garlic or you ate raw garlic (ew..) then this solution is for you. Simply eat parsley to get rid of the smell. Don&#39;t like parsley? Try brushing your teeth. ;)

[B]Cheesy feet:[/B]
Another common annoyance: smelly, cheesy feet. The reason for this stench is bacteria, which decomposes the foot&#39;s sweat. This procedure releases acids, which smell. The solution: Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda. Unexpected, huh? Put a spoonful of the powder into around 850ml of water, stir thoroughly and dip your stinky feet in.

[B]Cutting onions[/B]
When you&#39;re done with cutting onions and crying, you&#39;ll probably notice that your hands - if you&#39;re not wearing gloves - smell like onions. &quot;To the bathroom; time to wash my hands!&quot;. Wrong. It doesn&#39;t work. Don&#39;t cry; cut one or two slices of lemon or lime and wash your hands with it. And, uh, unless you love the taste of a lemon-onion mix, you should throw away the slice.

[B][U]-- Combating insects --[/U][/B]

[B]Wasps[/B]
This may not always work, but most of the time (for me, at least) it worked perfectly. If wasps are bugging (:P) you while eating outside, then try placing a few copper coins on the table. For some reason, most wasps dislike copper. Tada!

[B]Mosquitoes[/B]
To keep it short, simply place either a tomato plant, a lemon- or lime tree on/as near as possible to the window. Mosquitoes usually hate the smell of these plants. Alternatively - if you don&#39;t mind - you can use slices of garlic.

That&#39;s it for now. I&#39;ve collected/tested/found some of these things in my life and now I decided to write it all down and share these tips with others. Kudos to my dad and to a waitress in Berlin, for two of these tips.

<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">– Combating smells –</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Ew, garlic!</span><br>
If you ate food with a lot of garlic or you ate raw garlic (ew…) then this solution is for you. Simply eat parsley to get rid of the smell. Don’t like parsley? Try brushing your teeth. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Cheesy feet:</span><br>
Another common annoyance: smelly, cheesy feet. The reason for this stench is bacteria, which decomposes the foot’s sweat. This procedure releases acids, which smell. The solution: Sodium bicarbonate, also known as baking soda. Unexpected, huh? Put a spoonful of the powder into around 850ml of water, stir thoroughly and dip your stinky feet in.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Cutting onions</span><br>
When you’re done with cutting onions and crying, you’ll probably notice that your hands - if you’re not wearing gloves - smell like onions. “To the bathroom; time to wash my hands!”. Wrong. It doesn’t work. Don’t cry; cut one or two slices of lemon or lime and wash your hands with it. And, uh, unless you love the taste of a lemon-onion mix, you should throw away the slice.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">– Combating insects –</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Wasps</span><br>
This may not always work, but most of the time (for me, at least) it worked perfectly. If wasps are bugging (:P) you while eating outside, then try placing a few copper coins on the table. For some reason, most wasps dislike copper. Tada!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Mosquitoes</span><br>
To keep it short, simply place either a tomato plant, a lemon- or lime tree on/as near as possible to the window. Mosquitoes usually hate the smell of these plants. Alternatively - if you don’t mind - you can use slices of garlic.</p>
<p>That’s it for now. I’ve collected/tested/found some of these things in my life and now I decided to write it all down and share these tips with others. Kudos to my dad and to a waitress in Berlin, for two of these tips.</p>
