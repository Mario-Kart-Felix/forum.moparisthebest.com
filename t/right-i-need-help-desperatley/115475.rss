    <description>I have tried everythin to make my server work and it just doesnt want to :(
I was wondering if someone could possibly send me a server that could be run staright away and therefore i would be able to see if it works on my computer or its just i was doing something really wrong :)

If anyone could do this for me i would be extremely happy as i have a 11 week summa due to me just left school and goin to collage and need sumthin to occupy me with :)

Cheers i am also willing to host servers for people :)
