    <description>hey guys well i&quot;m looking for a co owner or owner it doesn&#39;t matter. i don&#39;t care if u have 1 post or not all i need to know is if your gonna be a good co owner/owner.i&quot;m mostly looking for a co owner/owner that can do the following,web design,coder, etc. i don&#39;t have a source/client but im very active. i&quot;m home schooled. so i&quot;m on most of the time. the source and client have to be either blank and then we can code or it can be a coded server with everything already in it. i don&#39;t like leeching so when we start working together were not gonna leech were gonna make a legit server coded by us. i&quot;m a very good coder but im a good learner so if your willing to help me code then awesome. the co owner/owner will get 50% donations. when im not on the server i expect the co owner/owner to take over my job while im gone. well i guess some things i expect from this person but there&#39;s one more thing. i would like this server to be a pking server. well thanks for taking the time to read this and i hope you will put this in thought. contact information:
email: campyanth@gmail.com
aim: campyanth

i like to be contacted over aim. i do not have a msn yet but i will make 1 later today.
note- the only reason i can&#39;t find a source/client is because i am never lucky enough to find 1.</description>
