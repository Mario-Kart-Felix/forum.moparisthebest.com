    <title>How to fix object and pickups? - Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-fix-object-and-pickups-please/339882</link>
    <description>Hello community!  I am using delta as a base to code a server that will (hopefully) take everyone back to the old runescape ways. lol.  I was wondering if there was a method to making a requirement that your character be at the object or item before it is picked up/opened/etc?

Any help appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
