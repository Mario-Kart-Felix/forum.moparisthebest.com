    <description>how hard would it be to make a ::dnsban command?

for anyone who doesnt know the :ipban cmmand is good in a way but it dont do anything for the people who can change their ip adresses

a dns is somthing your internet provider gives you and only they can change you can try to mask your dns but it wont do anything at all. 

now that I think of it I know Near Reality has this for the administrators I am wondering if it is released foor public or no? I know most servers load ip adress with dns but for the servers that just logg the ip adress will have to be fixed up so they read the dns also.

anyways the question is:
is there a :dnsban command?
if so what is it.
if not than what do you think will be needed to create one?</description>
