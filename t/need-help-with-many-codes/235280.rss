    <description>So I have many different things I need to know. First of all, I&#39;m using a Winterlove based server. 

[b]1.)[/b]The first thing I want to do is make it so that when you teleport, you don&#39;t need to have runes or need a magic level too do it. I tried this myself and it didn&#39;t work. (Didn&#39;t compile right)

[b]2.)[/b]The next thing I want to do is make some banks work... Almost none of them work and I want to make some of them work in the major cities...

[b]3.)[/b]Also I want to change my home spot, I don&#39;t know how to do this... I have tried looking in my client.java for the coordinates of the starting point (in falador) and it didn&#39;t show up...
