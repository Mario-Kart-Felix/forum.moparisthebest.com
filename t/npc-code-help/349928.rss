    <title>Npc code help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-code-help/349928</link>
    <description>alright, I&#39;m running a 517 server, and was wondering.. I&#39;ve seen servers that have npc&#39;s walking around.. I was wondering if anyone could teach me how to let npcs walk around? give me a little snippet or something... I was wondering if this had anything to do with it..
[code]spawn	=	####	XXXX	YYYY	H	0	0	0	0	0	Npc Name :o[/code]
I was wondering if the zeros had anything to do with it.. like the first zero being one x coord and the second zero being a y coord and the 3rd zero being a 2nd x and 4th zero being a 2nd y ... idk, I was wondering how you would make the npc&#39;s walk around.. :)</description>
