    <title>A command to show PK Points?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-command-to-show-pk-points/287123</link>
    <description>It usually is ::mypks but for some reason this source doesn&#39;t have it. and trust me, theres a pk point system just no way to check it. how do I make it tell them their Pk Points? :]

if (command.startsWith(&quot;mypks&quot;)) {
sM(&quot;You have +Pkpoints+&quot;) }
}

something like that

help?</description>

              <p>Well obviously you must have a Pking point system added, but here the command:</p>
<p><code>
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("mypks")) {
	    sM("You have currently " +pkPoints+ " Pk Points!");
	}</code></p>
<p>To cheack other’s pk points:</p>
<p><code>
if(command.startsWith("chekpoints")) {
String name = command.substring(11);
try {
int p = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name);
client c = (client) server.playerHandler.players[p];
c.sM(""+playerName+" Watched you're pk points!");
sM("This player has currently "+c.pkPoints+" Pk Points.");
} catch(Exception e) {
sM(name+" either isn't online or doesn't exist");
}
}</code></p>
