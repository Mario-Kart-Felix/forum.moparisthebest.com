    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-some-vb-would-be-great/2681</link>
    <description>ok soo i was bored and saw something about an auth system so i got reallly bored and made this, and now i made the basic layout of it, but in visual basic how do i make it so when you click the &quot;Send&quot; button it saves the information in a word or notepad file? and so that it clears the text box. if you guys can help it would be greatly apreciated. 
Thanks
