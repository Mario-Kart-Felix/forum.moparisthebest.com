              <p>2075 is the emote for shooting the xbow<br>
0427 is the range(crossbow) emote<br>
and your food should have cases, for example take the number of a manta and CTRL + F find it, i think its 823, then itll look like</p>
<p><code>case 823:
stuff here
break;</code><br>
you gotta make it look like this</p>
<p><code>case 823:
if (actionTimer &lt;= 0) {
stuff here
} else {
return = false
}
break;</code><br>
note: that actiontimer example wont work depending on your source<br>
to assign a weapon an attack emote, use this<br>
make sure your putting this under</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int GetWepAnim()</code></pre>
<p>then copy n paste this, and fill out the ###<span class="hashtag">#s</span></p>
<p><code>if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == ####) // weapon
{
return ####; //emote
}</code><br>
post for more help<br>
if anyone would like to correct me, please do(a couple month break and im rusty ;s)</p>
