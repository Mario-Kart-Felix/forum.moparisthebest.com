    <title>[Request] Website banner/logo</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-website-banner-logo/118089</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been needing a professional logo, but cant make a nice banner. this is what I will replace it with

http://runesource.org/src/img/VbStyle-Black/forum_logo.gif

I need a transparent background because this will go on the main page aswell.. (which is white)

All I need it to say is &quot;RuneSource&quot; with subtext saying &quot;Java Editing &amp; Development&quot; and If you put a design that looks good on it, then put it in. 
The text can either be a shade of grey or blue, or somthing that goes well with the site. thats my preference, but its really up to you if your making it. anyways thanks if you could do this, it&#39;s appreciated.

I offer a level 87 RS account... If you can do this for me, PM me or reply. 

Thanks</description>

              <p>Dude, do it yourself. Take a few days to learn the basics of photoshop, and then play around with it. This is the best way for you to have a logo since you will be making it.</p>
