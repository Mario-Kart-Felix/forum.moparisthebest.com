    <title>Connecting not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-not-working/363031</link>
    <description>I have tried to get my server to connect from another computer, but i can&#39;t get it to work.....
I have tried the regular method of portforwarding, and have changed my client connection to my no-ip.
It doesn&#39;t work.
I tried utorrent.
It says connection already started on port 43954 when i run my server.....
Help!!!</description>

<p>you have to portforward via utorrent after you have started to host your server otherwise anything using the port 43594/5555 before the server will say port is already in use hope this helps if you don’t understand what i mean ill explain in full detail but i believe that is an easy enough answer for you</p>
