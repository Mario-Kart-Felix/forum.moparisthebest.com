    <description>Ok so I need to use reflection so I don&#39;t have to unzip/deob my runescape.jar. CAn some one Explain what it is for me.</description>

              <p>You can also so stuff such as change the accessibility of fields and methods (and access private fields or methods of an object, for example), but the reflection package and no power to actually alter the class files - you need to use a bytecode library, like BCEL as White Castle recommended, to create something like a deobber.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>The reflection API represents, or reflects, the classes, interfaces, and objects in the current Java Virtual Machine. You'll want to use the reflection API if you are writing development tools such as debuggers, class browsers, and GUI builders. With the reflection API you can:
<pre><code>* Determine the class of an object.
* Get information about a class's modifiers, fields, methods, constructors, and superclasses.
* Find out what constants and method declarations belong to an interface.
* Create an instance of a class whose name is not known until runtime.
* Get and set the value of an object's field, even if the field name is unknown to your program until runtime.
* Invoke a method on an object, even if the method is not known until runtime.
* Create a new array, whose size and component type are not known until runtime, and then modify the array's components. 
</code></pre>
<p>First, a note of caution. Don’t use the reflection API when other tools more natural to the Java programming language would suffice. For example, if you are in the habit of using function pointers in another language, you might be tempted to use the Method objects of the reflection API in the same way. Resist the temptation! Your program will be easier to debug and maintain if you don’t use Method objects. Instead, you should define an interface, and then implement it in the classes that perform the needed action.</p>
<p>Other trails use the term “member variable” instead of “field.” The two terms are synonymous. Because the Field class is part of the reflection API, this trail uses the term “field.”</p>
<p>This trail uses a task-oriented approach to the reflection API. Each lesson includes a set of related tasks, and every task is explained, step by step, with a sample program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You use reflection to get information about existing .class files (gets methods, constructors, stuff like that). I’d recommend BCEL if you want more control though.</p>
