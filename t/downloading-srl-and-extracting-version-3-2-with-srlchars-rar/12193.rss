    <description>                       Are you tired of not knowing what you do??
Are you getting these or more similar ERRORS when trying to compile your script?:

[scar]Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL/SRL.Scar does not exist.
Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL/SRL/Skill/WoodCutting.Scar does not exist.
Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 2.03\includes\SRL/SRL/Misc/PlayerForm.Scar does not exist.
Unknown identifier &#39;FindColorCircleD&#39; in script C:\Documents and Settings\HP_Administrator\Desktop\SCAR 2.03\includes\srl\srl\core\Color.scar
Failed when compiling[/scar]

Then your at the right place!
This is going to explain to you how to download and extract new SRL includes into your computer. I made this because everywhere i go i always see someone that says
&quot;Cant download SRL&quot;, &quot;How do you extract&quot;, &quot;I keep getting these errors look!&quot;.
So if you have any problems like this, this guide is for you.

First off make sure you have the latest version of scar witch can be found here:
http://www.dylock.net/scar/

Once downloaded SCAR you will need includes for it.
Includes are big files that have loads of codes put into them to make scripting easier for us.
To download includes go to SCAR and click file ---&gt; download includes. 
This should download a whole bunch of includes but these are barley ever used because they are out of date.

This is the most recent up to date unclude witch is called SRL, SRL&#39;s newest version can be found here:    (VERSION 3.2)
http://dakotastorm.sslpowered.com/dakotastorm.com/SRL-Forum/showthread.php?t=2646


Now when downloading the newest version of SRL, Make sure to place it in the includes folder in SCAR.
After that is complete, now its time for the extracting part.

To extract you need a program called WinRAR witch can be downloaded here:
http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm

After downloading it there you will need to extract the new SRL you just downloaded into your computer.
ok here it goes...

[u]FIRST[/u]: Make sure you properly installed SRL into the includes folder and WinRAR into your computer.

[u]SECOND[/u]: Go to &quot;My Computer&quot; then click on &quot;presario (C:)&quot;[&lt;-- Yours might say something different but look for something that says &quot;(C:)&quot;]
Now after you clicked on that file look for a folder that is named &quot;Program files&quot;... click that.
You should see a whole bunch of folders... look for one that says &quot;SCAR 2.03&quot; and click on that.

[u]THIRD[/u]: Now you are in the SCAR folder where you will see something that looks like this:
[img]http://img505.imageshack.us/img505/626/scarfolderzw2.png[/img]
Although your icons may be different, but we should have the same file names.

[u]EXTRACTING[/u]: To extract, click on the includes folder and look for a icon that has 3 books stacked up and says SRL witch looks like this:
[img]http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/9755/srliconda2.png[/img]
now right click and select the option that says &quot;Extract here to SRL\&quot;
[img]http://img169.imageshack.us/img169/1449/srliconyh3.png[/img]
once you&#39;v extracted it, it has made a new folder named SRL.

[glow=red,2,300][u]NOTE[/u][/glow]: sometimes the new folder you extracted might of said something different like &quot;SRLv320&quot; or something similar to this, if this is the case just rename it &quot;SRL&quot;, just like that but without the  &quot; &#39;s  :P

Now that you have the extracting done,
its time to place the plugins into there folder.
To do this click on the new SRL folder you just extracted, then click SRL witch is located in that folder, and then you will see a folder named &quot;Place inside plugins folder&quot;. There should be icons in here witch NEED to be copied and put into a folder named &quot;Plugins&quot; witch is located in the same place where you found the &quot;Includes folder&quot;... Copy them one by one and insert them(paste) into the Plugins folder.

Heres a step by step picture:
[img]http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/7127/scarpluginslp2.png[/img]



Now for the last part..
Downloading and extracting SRLChars into the SRL\SRL folder.

The download link for this is:
http://dakotastorm.sslpowered.com/dakotastorm.com/SRL-Forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=882&amp;d=1156992271

Witch is attached to the bottom of the post as &quot;SRLchars.RAR&quot;
Download this and save it into your includes folder.

Now go to the includes folder by following the second step that i said before.
Copy the SRLchars.RAR and go into SRL and paste it in here.
Once it is pasted Right click and click &quot;Extract here to SRLchars\&quot;
Now you have succesfully installed SRLchars   :D

(If you didnt understand this, heres a picture below)
[img]http://img54.imageshack.us/img54/1535/srlcharstq5.png[/img]


Now that you have done all this
You have properly set up SRL and you can now start Autoing ;D

Hope this guide helps

<p>Okay this is what you do. You open up the includes folder that is located in the Scar 2.03 folder. Temporarily move the SRL v3.20 folder into some other location. Still inside the includes folder, right click, “New”, then choose “Folder”. Name that Folder “SRL”. Put the SRL v3.20 folder inside that “SRL” folder, and rename it “SRL”.</p>

              <pre><code>                   Are you tired of not knowing what you do??

Failed when compiling[/scar]</p>
<p>Then your at the right place!<br>
This is going to explain to you how to download and extract new SRL includes into your computer. I made this because everywhere i go i always see someone that says<br>
“Cant download SRL”, “How do you extract”, “I keep getting these errors look!”.<br>
So if you have any problems like this, this guide is for you.</p>
<p>First off make sure you have the latest version of scar witch can be found here:<br>
<a href="http://www.dylock.net/scar/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.dylock.net/scar/</a></p>
<p>Once downloaded SCAR you will need includes for it.<br>
Includes are big files that have loads of codes put into them to make scripting easier for us.<br>
To download includes go to SCAR and click file —&gt; download includes.<br>
This should download a whole bunch of includes but these are barley ever used because they are out of date.</p>
<p>This is the most recent up to date unclude witch is called SRL, SRL’s newest version can be found here:    (VERSION 3.2)<br>
<a href="http://dakotastorm.sslpowered.com/dakotastorm.com/SRL-Forum/showthread.php?t=2646" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dakotastorm.sslpowered.com/dakotastorm.com/SRL-Forum/showthread.php?t=2646</a></p>
<p>Now when downloading the newest version of SRL, Make sure to place it in the includes folder in SCAR.<br>
After that is complete, now its time for the extracting part.</p>
<p>To extract you need a program called WinRAR witch can be downloaded here:<br>
<a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm</a></p>
<p>After downloading it there you will need to extract the new SRL you just downloaded into your computer.<br>
ok here it goes…</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">FIRST</span>: Make sure you properly installed SRL into the includes folder and WinRAR into your computer.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">SECOND</span>: Go to “My Computer” then click on “presario (C:)”[&lt;-- Yours might say something different but look for something that says “(C:)”]<br>
Now after you clicked on that file look for a folder that is named “Program files”… click that.<br>
You should see a whole bunch of folders… look for one that says “SCAR 2.03” and click on that.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">THIRD</span>: Now you are in the SCAR folder where you will see something that looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://img505.imageshack.us/img505/626/scarfolderzw2.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Although your icons may be different, but we should have the same file names.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">EXTRACTING</span>: To extract, click on the includes folder and look for a icon that has 3 books stacked up and says SRL witch looks like this:<br>
<img src="http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/9755/srliconda2.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
now right click and select the option that says “Extract here to SRL”<br>
<img src="http://img169.imageshack.us/img169/1449/srliconyh3.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
once you’v extracted it, it has made a new folder named SRL.</p>
<p>[glow=red,2,300]<span class="bbcode-u">NOTE</span>[/glow]: sometimes the new folder you extracted might of said something different like “SRLv320” or something similar to this, if this is the case just rename it “SRL”, just like that but without the  " 's  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Now that you have the extracting done,<br>
its time to place the plugins into there folder.<br>
To do this click on the new SRL folder you just extracted, then click SRL witch is located in that folder, and then you will see a folder named “Place inside plugins folder”. There should be icons in here witch NEED to be copied and put into a folder named “Plugins” witch is located in the same place where you found the “Includes folder”… Copy them one by one and insert them(paste) into the Plugins folder.</p>
<p>Heres a step by step picture:<br>
<img src="http://img528.imageshack.us/img528/7127/scarpluginslp2.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now for the last part…<br>
Downloading and extracting SRLChars into the SRL\SRL folder.</p>
<p>The download link for this is:<br>
<a href="http://dakotastorm.sslpowered.com/dakotastorm.com/SRL-Forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=882&amp;d=1156992271" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dakotastorm.sslpowered.com/dakotastorm.com/SRL-Forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=882&amp;d=1156992271</a></p>
<p>Witch is attached to the bottom of the post as “SRLchars.RAR”<br>
Download this and save it into your includes folder.</p>
<p>Now go to the includes folder by following the second step that i said before.<br>
Copy the SRLchars.RAR and go into SRL and paste it in here.<br>
Once it is pasted Right click and click “Extract here to SRLchars”<br>
Now you have succesfully installed SRLchars   <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>(If you didnt understand this, heres a picture below)<br>
<img src="http://img54.imageshack.us/img54/1535/srlcharstq5.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Now that you have done all this<br>
You have properly set up SRL and you can now start Autoing ;D</p>
<p>Hope this guide helps<br>
