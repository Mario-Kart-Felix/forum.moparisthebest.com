              <p>This means when you’re trying to register your server on whatever toplist site you’re using, the site can’t detect that your server is running. This can be for many reasons, the most obvious being, your server isn’t running. Other possibilities:</p>
<p>[ul][li]You didn’t port-forward correctly (as suggested earlier)[/li]<br>
[li]On the site you type your IP address or port for your server wrong.[/li]<br>
[li](not likely) the toplist site isn’t properly working/pinging servers correctly.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Make sure you have port-forwarded correctly and the IP address for your server corresponds to the IP typed in the toplist site, if you still have the problem, let us know how you went about port-forwarding.</p>
