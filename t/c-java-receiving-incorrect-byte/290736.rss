    <description>abraham2119 says:

I have a networking application in which the server is written in C and the client in Java. Basically, I encounter an error when sending one of the following bytes: -112, -113, -115. When sending one of these bytes from the server to the client, the client receives them as a byte with a value of &#39;63&#39;. Since the original code is long, I wrote a sample application which illustrates my problem. Run the server, and then the client, and you will see that the client will print out the character: &#39;?&#39; which has an equivalent value to 63.

Here is the sample code:

              <p>Chances are it’s actually working as it should and you’re just misunderstanding your results. To avoid confussion, you should just stick to hex for describing each byte. Something such as 0x0D is much clearer than a one-byte char such as ‘?’ in C, a two-byte char in Java such as ‘?’ or a signed integer such as -112.</p>
<p>A Java char is also different than a C char. A C char is a type on its own, equivalent to EITHER signed or unsigned char, depending on the implementation. In most architectures it will be a single byte long. However a Java char is as Jython_ implied, a <em>two</em> bytes integer.</p>

              <p>An idea… char’s are unsigned (0-65536), so maybe that’s the issue?</p>
