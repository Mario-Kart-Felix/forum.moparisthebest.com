    <title>Need Help On My Shops! I have NOO clue what&#39;s wrong!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-on-my-shops-i-have-noo-clue-whats-wrong/411140</link>
    <description>On my server, everytime someone tried to buy something from shops, it opens a blank shop (it used to open a different shop but we deleted it). Now it just opens a blank shop when you want to buy something. It also doesn&#39;t even give you the item. Can someone help ASAP? Thanks in advance!!</description>
