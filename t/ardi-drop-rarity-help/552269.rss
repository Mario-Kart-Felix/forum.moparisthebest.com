    <title>[ARDI] drop RARity Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ardi-drop-rarity-help/552269</link>
    <description>okay so i thought i had everything figured out invalving my drops so a couple buddies of mine and myself was testing drops and we quickly figure out it wan not exactly when i thought.

this is what my drops look like:
[code]	public static final int[][] NPC_DROPS = {
			// {NPCID,ITEMID,ITEMAMMOUNT,RARITY}
			// Rock Crab
			{ 1265, 3610, 1, 20 },
			{ 1265, 2677, 1, 7 },
			{ 1265, 526, 1, 0 },
			{ 1265, 995, 15000, 0 },[/code]

This is a Code in my NPC Handler that i dont exactly understand how to read. (meaning i dont know exactly what the code is saying)
[code]	for (npc = 0; npc &lt; Config.NPC_DROPS.length; npc++) {
				if (npcs[i].npcType == Config.NPC_DROPS[npc][0]) {
					if (Misc.random(Config.NPC_DROPS[npc][3]) == 0) {
							Server.itemHandler.createGroundItem(c,
									Config.NPC_DROPS[npc][1], npcs[i].absX,
									npcs[i].absY, Config.NPC_DROPS[npc][2],
									c.playerId);
					}[/code]

I set arma to drop hilt Rarity = 55 thinking it meant 1/55 chance to get it as a drop.
[code]//arma boss
{ 6222, 11702, 1, 55 },[/code]

i know for a fact setting the rarity to 0 makes it drop everytime but anyways when i tested drops we got 2 hilts in like 10-15 kills and we has gotten nearly 2 armadyl armour sets which body&amp; legs are set to 35 and helm 25. 

when we was killing zammy (kril) we was getting like 2-5 items per drop so it was just crazy how fast we was getting everything. we even go zam hilt first kill which is set to 25 rarity.

i wanted arma hilt to be 1/55 and zam to be 1/25 and i also dont care how much of the normal loots you get per kill but like 2-4 of the rare loots in one kill is crazy.

can anyone tell him how the rarity in my drop system works and/or how to calculate what the drops would be in % or fraction?
It maybe the case that this is just a bad drop rate system to use and if that is the case ill have to find snippet or tut to adding a more straight forward drop system.</description>

okay thank you for the very well explained description of how it work. i just spread the rates out some and now you dont get like 5items per kill lol.<br>
[/quote]<br>
should probably rewrite your drop system to properly prevent that[/quote]</p>
<p>which can be done by not looping through like how you are doing it now</p>

              <p>That a close to perfect explanation above, the way the drops are handled in most PI based servers are horrible, although it’s still down to luck, I’d suggest upping your drop rate for armadyl to sustain you’re economy.</p>

              <p>Let’s say you set that rarity value to 9.</p>
<p>NPC_DROPS is a two-dimensional array.</p>
<p><code>if (npcs[i].npcType == Config.NPC_DROPS[npc][0]) {
    if (Misc.random(Config.NPC_DROPS[npc][3]) == 0) {</code></p>
<p>If the npcType is the same as the npcType listed in [npc][0], proceed. [npc][0] in this case is 1265. [row][column]</p>
<p>Now here is what you’re looking for in this next if-statement. [npc][3] is that RARITY value you’re looking at. misc.random(value) is going to return an integer between 0 and value. So if you have misc.random(9), you are going to return a random number between 0 and 9. If you have Misc.random(Config.NPC_DROPS[npc][3]), you’ll return a number between 0 and RARITY.</p>
<p><code>if (Misc.random(Config.NPC_DROPS[npc][3]) == 0) </code> is saying that if the RANDOMLY CHOSEN NUMBER from 0-RARITY is ZERO, drop the item id in [npc][1] and the amount of [npc][2]. This means a RARITY of 0 will always drop because a random number between 0 and 0 is always 0.</p>
<p>So if you have a rarity value of 9, it is a 1/10 chance the item will be dropped. (because 0-9 is ten numbers. the item will ONLY be dropped if misc.random returns 0).</p>
<p>With this system, it is possible to receive all of the NPC’s drops at one time, although depending on numbers, it will be unlikely. It’s going to use misc.random on every single drop the NPC has because of the for-loop. It’s going to loop through every row of NPC_Drops --&gt; if the dead npc has the same id as [npcs][0], do the misc.random --&gt; if the misc.random is 0, drop the item --&gt; move onto the next row).</p>
