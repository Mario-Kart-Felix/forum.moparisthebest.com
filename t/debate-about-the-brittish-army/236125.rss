    <title>Debate about the brittish army</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/debate-about-the-brittish-army/236125</link>
    <description>Theres no doubt that the brittish army is the most well trained army in the world, thus making us powerful, because Britain is a small country meaning that if we were the size of America we would probably be a powerful country. Ive seen a debate about the Americans supplying guns to Germans in WWII. Im not doubting if its true or if its fake but in my opinion i believe its true. The Russian army has alot of weapons but because there such a big country they can have a massive army, and tbh the Russian army if you ask me are a piece of shit. They have estimately 15/1 to Brittish soldiers yet each Brittish soldier could probably take out like 9 on their own. If china were going to war with the world they would win no doubt. The reason the Germans were good in WWII was because Hitler was a smart man, he had tactics and knew what he was doing.</description>

<p>Exactly, so they should have been more catious, rather than dropping a test weapon on one of the most popular Japanese cities. Besides of which, that is hardly any excuse because if it were the case, why did they drop a second a week later?</p>

wouldnt ‘most unstable’ or ‘the least stable’ worked 100x better there?</p>

<p>This one was your only sort of true answer, Russia has about 15,000 however most of them since the collapse of the soviet union have not been properly kept up so most may not work, however the USA has more deliverable nuclear weapons than Russia.</p>

<p>Depends, Britain and America both rely heavily on each other. Detestably the only super power still remaining is the United States (but even that is debatable as far as the last 20 or so years are concerned) and if Russia and Britain were to go to war, we’d have the US fighting on our front and Russia would have… well… no-one because nobody wants to oppose the powerhouse that is the combination of UK+US <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Even China, the worlds up and coming superpower wouldn’t take on such a combination. The reason being, the extensive range of allies the UK/US have means they have antimissile sites all over the planet.</p>

<p>Actually, they could. A Tiger tank has a really good armoured front. Combined with the fact that it can penetrate a Sherman tank at a range of about 2km, it was devestating. A Sherman couldn’t even <span class="bbcode-i">hit</span> a Tiger from that distance, let alone penetrate the armour of it. The reason that the Allies won a the war was that for one Tiger, the Allies built 5 Shermans. And Sherman tanks were way faster then a Tiger (There is a movie about this, I can’t remember the name).</p>

              <p>The reasons that Germany was über (to use their terms) were simple. They were motivated, the convention after WWI (I believe it was in Vienna) made Germany paid a shit load of gold/money etc… So the Germans were poor, and Hitler benefitted of that.</p>
<p>The German war industry always has been great. The German weapons in the French-German war were superior, in WWI they were superior and in WWII they were. And it’s not true that the US gave the Germans weapons, I don’t know where you based that on but it’s bullshit.</p>
<p>The Brittish army is quite good now, but it hasn’t always been like that. The navy was great, and still is. But the ground troops weren’t that great, and are average now. The SAS is great, and probably the best in its kind. But normal soldiers are average, as I said.</p>
<p>The problem with Russia is that it had a reputation, one that was about the quality of their guns. Their guns sucked, it was shit. They did have an advantage when it came to army size, but the country is so huge that it took ages for them to get a well-sized army to the front. The Germans used this to their advantage in WWI. The von Schlieffenplan was simple. First take out the French army, that was unorganised and badly equipped. The French had a great defensive line at the French-German border, close to Elzas-Lotharingen. By going via Belgium, the Germans evaded that line. Then quickly move the troops to the east. The Russians should be ready by that time, but still were no match.</p>
<p>It all went a bit different. The Belgians didn’t cooperate, so it took to long to get to France. Then the French decided to dig themselves in, and voila, you have two fronts instead of one.</p>

              <p>Theres no doubt that the brittish army is the most well trained army in the world, thus making us powerful, because Britain is a small country meaning that if we were the size of America we would probably be a powerful country. Ive seen a debate about the Americans supplying guns to Germans in WWII. Im not doubting if its true or if its fake but in my opinion i believe its true. The Russian army has alot of weapons but because there such a big country they can have a massive army, and tbh the Russian army if you ask me are a piece of shit. They have estimately 15/1 to Brittish soldiers yet each Brittish soldier could probably take out like 9 on their own. If china were going to war with the world they would win no doubt. The reason the Germans were good in WWII was because Hitler was a smart man, he had tactics and knew what he was doing.</p>
