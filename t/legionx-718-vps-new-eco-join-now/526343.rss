    <description>[size=14pt][u][b][center]LegionX [Official][/center][/b][/u][/size]
[size=10pt][center][b]Out Of BETA! Added VPS![/b][/center][/size]

[center]New Forums Coming Soon! That One Is Temp![/center]

[u][center][b]Background information[/b][/center][/u]
[center]When I opened LegionX for the very first time a couple of months ago I was sure that my server was certain for success but little did I know that the server actually wasn&#39;t as good as I thought and had to be shut down due to lack of funds a couple of months later! I have, since then, upgraded every component of the server that I can! The server is so much better than before and I cannot wait for people to start playing![/center]

[center][u][b]What Makes Me Proud Of The Server![/b][/u][/center]
[center]The server has taken me so long to make the game have many features so that players are never bored of the server! I am dedicated toward keeping my server successful and alive! I am not like many server owners who are just money hungry. I made LegionX because I enjoyed doing so and I will enjoy knowing that people are having fun on a game that I have developed purely by myself![/center]

[center][u][b]Server Overview[/b][/u][/center]
LegionX has a fully working top of the range VPS. Our skilling is perfect. Our boss&#39;s, such as Nex and Godwars bosses are flawless, our minigames are all working! (Including Dominion Tower)! Although LegionX is more of an eco based server pking can gain you great rewards from pk points! Join LegionX now! Webclient and decent forums are coming soon!:)
