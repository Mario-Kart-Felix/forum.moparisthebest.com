    <title>Economy-Based Delta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/economy-based-delta/283466</link>
    <description>I got bored and tryed coding out.

Pics?:

Why should I post freaking pictures, or take the time taking them? It&#39;s Delta, you all know whats in it.

First 10 days turned into the following:(direct from a .txt in the source lol.)

[code]Global objects:
Most of Home seems okay, Restrictions in place.
Although fishing spots are getting on my nerves.
For some reason, they dont appear as a Global Object

Teleport related:
Monster tele removed, just need to figure out how to remove the interface.
Removed most teleports!

Economy related:
No Dragon weapons added to shops, aside Claws.
Shops nerfed to suit my F2P Strength in the economy.
Shop items removed and stock reduced in order to demand Skilling!251

NPC Drops:
Hill Giants satisfactory, although I may remove Rune Battleaxe.

NPC Spawns:
About 7% completed, maybe more as I am unsure of how much more
Areas I will be adding.

Object Teleports/Npc:
Successfully made the Raft at Home take players to Crash Island.
Raft back from Crash Island completed.
Ladder to the Hill Giants Completed.
Ladder leading back to Home done.
Teleport to Fallador made.
Elkoy takes players to Gnome agility course.[/code]

There&#39;s more, but I can&#39;t really be bothered with the rest.

EDIT: forgot the credits, my bad.

NOTE: I don&#39;t know all of the credits, so bare with me.

Its nice, you should make it more F2P. ;), like add moss giants for better drops.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is just a base-economy for other people… My version has a lot more things, but I wont be releasing because, well… I want my own to be unique and something I can fart around on with friends <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Basically, I was over all the “pk servers” which destroyed everything that people like Delta and Pali work on servers for.</p>
<p>So, basically… A couple of things were removed, locations changed ect (as I’m working on it for me and a few friends to fart around on when we’re bored of runescape.)</p>
<p>The main focus of the economy, is F2P with a little bit of P2P.</p>
<p>I just want to see Delta being used for something other then just a pk server, it has easy coding, all skills ect ect.</p>
