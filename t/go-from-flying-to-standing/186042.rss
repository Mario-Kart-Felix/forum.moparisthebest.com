    <description>How do I go from the flying command to standing normally on the ground?
Here&#39;s my code for flying...

&lt;blockquote&gt;else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;fly&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;playername&quot;))
{
setAnimation(1500);
playerSE = 1501;
playerSEW = 1851;
playerSER = 1851;
playerSEA = 1851;
sendMessage(&quot;I&#39;m Flying! Weeee!&quot;);
		updateRequired = true; appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 02, 2008, 10:15:02 PM[/size][hr]Any help, from anyone, please? Any ideas?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 03, 2008, 01:59:34 AM[/size][hr]Does anyone know the walking animation number?

Since I know the flying animation is 1851, and the levitation animation is 1500 what is the normal standing still animation? (if I knew that I could make this code to make the person land on the ground)</description>
