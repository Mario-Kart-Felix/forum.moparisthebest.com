    <title>Making a hyperlink open in different browsers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-hyperlink-open-in-different-browsers/491653</link>
    <description>My school is annoying as hell. All the computers default to IE on restart, or logout. So every time I have to log in, open chrome, set as default, and all that.
So is there a way I could make a shortcut that opens to a specific page, with chrome only?

Oh, and I have epic bot. Is there a way to force safe mode without hitting &#39;s&#39; during load?</description>

It is a bad thing for schools because it didn’t come built into the OS, thats why they wont change. Thats the reason every school I’ve been to gave me. Even though each teacher I’ve talked to about it has a pendrive with Opera, Firefox, or Chrome installed. Its not a bad thing to people who actually know. Just remember, most school boards (aka old people who don’t actually know a ton about technology) think that just because it is built into the OS, it means it is far more secure than any other you can download.[/quote]<br>
The IT department at my district makes it mandatory that FireFox, Chrome, and IE are installed (obviously IE is), but they still default to using IE…</p>

<p>Haha, similar story, installed a cracked version of photoshop and I got called into the headteacher’s office and threatened with a half a million pound fine, they said they were close to calling the police…  Was banned permanently from using computers after that.</p>
<p>At topic, I doubt the network admin can just set it up so you can explicitly have chrome as default, the way it worked in my school, the appdata folder was wiped every time the user logged out.  If he were to do it, he would most likely have to make every one using the system with chrome as default.</p>

<p>Well, at my CTS, I got Halo installed and all that. But that’s because it’s not a normal school, and the funding we receive is way better than public schools. But of course it’s the public school that’s an issue <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>My school uses iboss for internet security. and some n network shit for the computers.<br>
I don’t know what the hell they were thinking. They made it possible for 4 computers to run on 1 tower. That’s by far the stupidest thing they could do, seeing as the computers have 2gbs ram max, each.</p>

So is there a way I could make a shortcut that opens to a specific page, with chrome only?</p>
<p>Oh, and I have epic bot. Is there a way to force safe mode without hitting ‘s’ during load?</p>
