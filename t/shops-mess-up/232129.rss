    <title>Shops mess-up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shops-mess-up/232129</link>
    <description>Hey,

[tt]As we all know, I&#39;m a self admitted leecher.
I&#39;ve made a mistake again. I&#39;ve had this one for some time, but it wasn&#39;t answered before and I&#39;m not going to necromance that topic now.

Anyway, my shops refuse to work unless you access the shop by talking as opposed to trading the shopkeeper, but even then it only works with some shops. Recently, I have relocated the shopkeepers to a new shops location, and since they have not worked. I am determined to keep going with the new location though, unless it is absolutely necessary to revert to the old area.[/tt]

Help?
