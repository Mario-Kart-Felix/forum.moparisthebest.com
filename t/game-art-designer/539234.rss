    <description>I am in need of a graphic designer. You may have seen my post about the game I am developing called Space Anthem. I need the images done for this game. I will give you full credit for your work.

I am horrid at graphics, and it is near impossible to find images that not only match each others graphic styles, but are the correct sizes I require. I would also like these done in .png format. Space Anthem is a side scrolling bullet hell game.

What Images I Am Asking For:

Player Ship 64x32
Player Ship Animated 64x32 (two subimages animated flames emitting from the thrusters)
Player Laser 16x4 (This can be animated or not up to you)
Asteroid 64x64 (Again this can be animated, but is not required)
Enemy 1 48x32 (animated 2 subimages flashing lights)
Enemy Bullet 8x8
Enemy 2 64x32
Boss 192x192 (Will need to go over this with you before you create it.)

That&#39;s it for now, there may be a few more in the future, but maybe just 1 or 2 more. Thanks in advance! I would also appreciate a little preview of the player ship if that&#39;s possible.</description>
