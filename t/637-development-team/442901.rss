    <description>[center][size=24pt]637 Development Team Need![/size][/center]

If your reading this then your interested in working with a team on a 637 dementhium server.

There are a few things that we will need on this team.

1. We will need someone familiar with java programing.
2. We will need someone who is familiar with HTML for the webclient.
3. Most importantly we need someone who is social and not afraid to pitch an idea, someone who can become friends with the team to provide the best results for the server.

This server can go far we just need more than 2 people to work on it.

If you would like to work on this amazing server then send me a PM and we can work out communications and get to working  :)</description>
