Hey guys,</p>
<p>I dont mean to preach or anything but if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all. I don’t know whether Matt coded every part of his server or not but there is no need to turn this into a dissing board against him.</p>
<p>Seriously, there is way too much dissing going on around the rsc community and then we wonder why there is so much ddosing going on. If someone makes a server then leave them to it… If you like it, play it… if you then dont like it… then just dont play it.</p>

<p>yo fuck u and your gay preaching nigger[/quote]</p>
<p>Since when is having common sense considered “preaching”?</p>
