[b]Live Radio DJ[/b]
We are now offering our own live radio stream with a professional DJ - Evan. We plays various genres that include rap, hip hop, rock, pop, electric, metal, jazz, and sometimes we play funny commercials like the WTF Blanket!?! commercial.

[b]Live Support System[/b]
When we say live support, we mean it. InnovationX has selected trusted members of the community to serve as [b]Live Support Operators[/b]. We always have [b]3[/b] [b]Live Support Operators[/b] online. Each [b]Live Support Operator[/b] has been chosen according to their time-zone and languages spoken. For example, when it is 3:00 AM in the United States, there will be Australian and Asian [b]Live Support Operators[/b] online, as across the earth it is 3:00 PM and many will need support. [b]MOST[/b] of our [b]Live Support Operators[/b] are fluent in more than 1 language, in fact some are so well, they speak [b]4 different languages[/b]! We currently use [b]LiveZilla FREE[/b] for our Live Support system.

[b]Dedication To It&#39;s Best[/b]
InnovationX is dedicated to serving customers, such as you. We want you to experience a new type of private server, one in which is a democracy. We don&#39;t do things without asking your opinion of it first. Nearly all of our updates have fair-polls that are open to the public. People can vote whether or not the update would enhance InnovationX. [b]ALL[/b] of our staff members are voted on by current staff members, keeping staff quality upright.

[b]The Forums[/b]
Here at InnovationX, we hate illegal affairs. Our [b]vBulletin[/b] forums are [b][u]PAID[/u][/b] as well as our themes.

Here&#39;s a few facts:
[spoiler=Show Facts][b]1)[/b] You cannot use any version of the software without a license.
[b]2)[/b] You void all your warranty and support by using ANY version of the software other than the one you obtained via members area here.
[b]3)[/b] You void all your warranty and support by editing the version of the software you downloaded via members area.
[b]4)[/b] Nulled version have a lot of known security issues which I will not outline. By using them (which is illegal in 99% of the case), you open your forum, and everything associated with it up to hackers and malicious users.
[b]5)[/b] Your host may close your account (this applies to dedicated/colocated servers in datacenters) when they notice you are housing illegal software using their bandwidth, even if you are rightfully licensed.
[b]6)[/b] Jelsoft can, have been, and always will take appropriate legal actions against those using vBulletin illegally.[/spoiler]

Our forums are [b]ACTIVE[/b]. Unlike other server&#39;s forums, when you post something, expect it to be answered in a few minutes, not a few weeks. Here at InnovationX we are proud to have one of the most active forums in RSPS.

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Live Radio DJ</span><br>
We are now offering our own live radio stream with a professional DJ - Evan. We plays various genres that include rap, hip hop, rock, pop, electric, metal, jazz, and sometimes we play funny commercials like the WTF Blanket!?! commercial.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Live Support System</span><br>
When we say live support, we mean it. InnovationX has selected trusted members of the community to serve as <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operators</span>. We always have <span class="bbcode-b">3</span> <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operators</span> online. Each <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operator</span> has been chosen according to their time-zone and languages spoken. For example, when it is 3:00 AM in the United States, there will be Australian and Asian <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operators</span> online, as across the earth it is 3:00 PM and many will need support. <span class="bbcode-b">MOST</span> of our <span class="bbcode-b">Live Support Operators</span> are fluent in more than 1 language, in fact some are so well, they speak <span class="bbcode-b">4 different languages</span>! We currently use <span class="bbcode-b">LiveZilla FREE</span> for our Live Support system.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Dedication To It’s Best</span><br>
InnovationX is dedicated to serving customers, such as you. We want you to experience a new type of private server, one in which is a democracy. We don’t do things without asking your opinion of it first. Nearly all of our updates have fair-polls that are open to the public. People can vote whether or not the update would enhance InnovationX. <span class="bbcode-b">ALL</span> of our staff members are voted on by current staff members, keeping staff quality upright.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The Forums</span><br>
Here at InnovationX, we hate illegal affairs. Our <span class="bbcode-b">vBulletin</span> forums are <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">PAID</span></span> as well as our themes.</p>
<p>Here’s a few facts:<br>
[spoiler=Show Facts]<span class="bbcode-b">1)</span> You cannot use any version of the software without a license.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">2)</span> You void all your warranty and support by using ANY version of the software other than the one you obtained via members area here.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">3)</span> You void all your warranty and support by editing the version of the software you downloaded via members area.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4)</span> Nulled version have a lot of known security issues which I will not outline. By using them (which is illegal in 99% of the case), you open your forum, and everything associated with it up to hackers and malicious users.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">5)</span> Your host may close your account (this applies to dedicated/colocated servers in datacenters) when they notice you are housing illegal software using their bandwidth, even if you are rightfully licensed.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">6)</span> Jelsoft can, have been, and always will take appropriate legal actions against those using vBulletin illegally.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>Our forums are <span class="bbcode-b">ACTIVE</span>. Unlike other server’s forums, when you post something, expect it to be answered in a few minutes, not a few weeks. Here at InnovationX we are proud to have one of the most active forums in RSPS.</p>
