    <title>Sicko</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sicko/111316</link>
    <description>If you haven&#39;t seen it. See it. It isn&#39;t on Tv-Links.. So go torrent it off Demonoid. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The movie Sicko is an examination of problems in the American for-profit health insurance and pharmaceutical industries. It talks about the insurance industry and how it is currently a system wherein they make more money by denying health care than by providing it. You hear about how PHARMA is the largest and most powerful lobbyist block in Washington D.C. Sicko exposes the fact that America is the only industrialized nation in the world that still does not have national health care and most Americans don&#39;t even know it. It takes a look at examples and testimonies about corruption and abuses that cost Americans billions of dollars every year and he highlights the failings of our system with a trip to Cuba where he shows that quality, affordable health care is something that even small, poor nations are capable of providing it&#39;s citizens if they want to.


Michael Moore accompanies a number of rescue workers injured after the World Trade Center attacks of 2001 to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay detainment camp (an American territory) to ask for health care for the 9/11 responders. When unable to receive care there, they move on to Havana, Cuba, so that they can receive medical treatment they would otherwise not be able to afford. Although trip participants signed confidentiality agreements prohibiting them from talking about the trip, some thought the trip a success, with The New York Post quoting John Feal, head of the Fealgood Foundation which raises money for 9/11 first responders, that “From what I hear through the grapevine those people who went [to Cuba with Moore] are utterly happy.&quot; In an interview with Time Magazine, Moore states &quot;I’m not trumpeting Castro or his regime. I just want to say to fellow Americans, &quot;C’mon, we’re the United States! If they can [provide care for all] we can do it.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>edit2: I just finished watching it. I’m not quite sure to say because I’m really not educated on the health care system. It’s very easy to give in and agree with this movie, but coming from one of the most bias’ed people in the world I’m just not sure what to think.</p>

<p>True he is bias’ed but you can deny that our health care system is not the greatest…</p>
<p>And that a country this big does not have Universal Health care for its people? While all of the other rich country’s in the world do? Something has to be wrong… We have enough money to waste billions of dollars on a fucking war… But not enough to take care of our own people?</p>
