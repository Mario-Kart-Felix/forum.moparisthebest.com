<p>Did you really just correct someone because they didn’t capitalise an acronym? Seriously what has this website become?[/quote]So if you were to make a website, you’d be able to deal with permanent misspellings? Typing on a forum and writing text for a website are 2 completely different things. Websites are professional, and look disgusting if things are misspelled or just plain wrong. On forums poor grammar is expected.</p>
<p>Yes, I did correct him; because he’s wrong.</p>
<p>[quote=“Muroth, post:1, topic:395228”]Looks good, but I don’t like the new RS website, maybe because i’m on a shit old XP desktop with wireless adapter that’s slow. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> Good job.</p>
<p>and actually, you use &lt;?php not &lt;?PHP so, it doesn’t matter what acronyms you use as stated above.[/quote]&lt;?php is part of the code, not the name of the language. Nice try, though.</p>
<p>EDIT: And by definition, acronyms are capitalized. You already contradicted yourself.</p>
