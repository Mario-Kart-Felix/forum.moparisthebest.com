    <description>Hi, the client I am using is Richscape&#39;s client, and after using it for along time I noticed that it was badly known for it&#39;s t2 errors and getplayer size missmatch errors. Well I have tried fixing these errors but I can&#39;t seem to get rid of them. It happens really bad in player vs player combat. How could I resolve these errors?
