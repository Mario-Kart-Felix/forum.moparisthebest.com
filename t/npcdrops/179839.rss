    <description>I have tried asking before, but never really got any answers. I know a lot of other people are wondering about this too. Does anyone know how to switch the npcdrop files from item2.java to npcdrops.cfg?
The only server I have seen that actually uses npcdrops.cfg is Devolution v7, and that is what I have grown acustommed to. 

I&#39;d love for some help =)
Thanks</description>
