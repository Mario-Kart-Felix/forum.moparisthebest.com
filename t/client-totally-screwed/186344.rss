    <title>Client totally screwed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-totally-screwed/186344</link>
    <description>Alright, so I was messing around with my client a little bit (lol asking for trouble there), when I realized, I can no longer log into [b]ANY[/b] server, even my local host one.  Can someone help me out and tell me what&#39;s wrong.  I changed all server ip statements to localhost, but it doesn&#39;t work at all.</description>
