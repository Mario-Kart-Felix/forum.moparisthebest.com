              <p>use <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a>, type in 43594 as the port. If it doesn’t connect then you have to check to see if you ip has changed, which with <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> it will have your ip right above in bold text. Next make sure your firewall allows incoming and outgoing packets, if that is fine make sure your ip is the same with the router, when you turn your computer off your router will reclaim the ip and most likely give you a new one when you reconnect to it, if it is different then configure your network adapter to manually set the ip, choose an ip that is at least 20 - 30 away from your other devices so it gives them room and doesn’t screw things up. If you did all that correctly your computer should be able to turn off and then reclaim the same ip every time.</p>

              <p>Then something else is blocking them, check your firewall to make sure the exception you added is still their. Also make sure if you have a dynamic ip you use <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> for the DNS updating or else you will have to contentiously change the ip and create a new download link every time your ip changes.</p>
