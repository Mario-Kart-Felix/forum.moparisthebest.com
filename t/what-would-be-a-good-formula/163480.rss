    <title>What would be a good formula</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-be-a-good-formula/163480</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to come up with a formula so the worse the bonuses etc are sort of thing the lower the number gets...

It&#39;s really hard to explain

Say for example if Player X is using ice barrage on Player Y;

Player X is level 90 Magic with 85+ Mage Atk Bonus
Player Y is level 83 Magic with 110+ Mage Def Bonus

The chance of the barrage hitting will be higher than if

Player X is level 90 Magic with 20+ Mage Atk Bonus
Player Y is level 83 Magic with 210+ Mage Def Bonus

But obviously if

Player X is level 99 Magic with 110+ Mage Atk Bonus
Player Y is level 1 Magic with -20 Mage Def Bonus

It&#39;s going to hit practically all the time.

So i want this method to produce a higher number the better the chance of the spell hitting is and a lower number the better the chance of a spell splashing is, ty if you understand;

[code]
public int PlayerMageDefence(int PID, int P2ID){
int P2MageDef = P2ID;
client P2M = (client) server.playerHandler.players[P2MageDef];
int Player2MageDef = P2M.playerBonus[8];
int PlayerMageAtt = playerBonus[4];
int ReturnNumber = THIS IS THE FORMULA I NEED TO DO WHAT I JUST ASKED;

return ReturnNumber;
}
[/code]</description>
