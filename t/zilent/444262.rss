    <title>Zilent</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zilent/444262</link>
    <description>Doesn&#39;t post much but he&#39;s working on RSCD daily and is the reason why RSCE &#39;succeeded&#39;, very unspoken about person. Incredibly knowledgeable and extremely humble, never asks for anything and it would be good to get him some kind of status.

He&#39;s made a RSC client in C++ from scratch, understanding the RSC client completely (except for the Camera class, but he will get there). He knows RSC far more than xEnt does that has the &#39;RSC Guru&#39; status.</description>

              <p>Oh and his C++ work is re-doing pretty much the entire RSC client in a modern, OOP approach. The main reason for doing this is to make it harder for bots, there’s not many people who will be able to reverse engineer this in this scene. It’s far too tedious for someone in the RSC scene to bother. It’s really not something we want public but I suppose the server couldn’t hurt when it’s done.</p>
<p>That’s not a bad shout actually, allowing the server to be released with the option of changing what IP the client points to in a text file or something, allowing people to dev plug-ins and content without running off and making their own server.</p>

              <p>Ah right. Well yeah, I was thinking it’s a bit weird that xEnt has the custom title when it’s accepted that Zilent far surpasses xEnt’s knowledge when it comes to RSC development and the RSC client itself. If it’s custom text then it takes a bit of meaning away.</p>
<p>Lets put it like this, I see people with ‘Java guru’ or ‘C++ guru’ and have never heard of them, Zilent is genuinely seriously skilled in both although he says C++ is his strong point and he hates Java. Any kind of status would be good but I think he’d appreciate something C++ related more. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>TBH he barely uses Mopar as he hates the kids talking shit, I doubt he’d notice but IDK, it just seems appropriate. Maybe because I know him so well and know what he’s capable of etc.</p>

              <p>If he were to open source the C++ stuff then I suspect it would be evaluated as well worth the C++ cup (Togepi award image, iirc) if he’s as good as you say he is.<br>
The RSC Guru title you’re referring to is merely custom text that xEnt has given to himself. As a moderator, he had this ability.</p>
