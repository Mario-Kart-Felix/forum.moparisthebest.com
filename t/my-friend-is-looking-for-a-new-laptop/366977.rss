    <title>My friend is looking for a new laptop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-friend-is-looking-for-a-new-laptop/366977</link>
    <description>My friend has a mother who is a moron. No matter what anyone says to her, anything that involves more than Microsoft Office is a virus. My friend is looking for a laptop in which he can play RuneScape and do other tasks such as homework on. He has a $400-$500 budget.

As I know little about hardware, I was wondering if you guys could throw some ideas out here. He does not care about graphics and he does not intend on installing giant programs to it. I doubt he could do anything advanced so it needs to be simple.

Any ideas?</description>

              <p>I’d order one off <a href="http://newegg.com">newegg.com</a> (or tigerdirect, both are equally good) if you can.  We recently (4-5 months ago) purchased an MSI brand laptop, and I love it.  I’ve been using MSI motherboards in just about all my computers for damn near 10 years, and I’ve never had a complaint about them either.  MSI is just an all around good company.</p>

              <p>Try going to (sounds ghetto) but Wal-Mart or Best Buy, Wal-Mart sells crap things, but if he uses it properly it will last him quite a long time. And Best Buy are scum bags who will try to rip him off, but if he goes with someone who knows what he needs and how much it’s worth I think he will be fine.</p>
