    <description>Ive implemented both these systems for npc chats, and both seem to compile perfectly, however whenever I test it out it just does not work at all.. Ive checked to make sure everything is there.. what am i missing? im using moparclassic&#39;s build.xml so that the build shouldnt be the problem.. any suggestions?</description>

<p>is that still using the single thread with the abstract delayed events? if so looks very neat compared to it’s java version.[/quote]I don’t think so; I think it would be a bit messier by using lambdas and currying.</p>
