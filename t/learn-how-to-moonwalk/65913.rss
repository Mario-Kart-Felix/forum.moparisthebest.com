    <description>[u]I learned moonwalking by this video perfectly, chicks dig it![/u]
Read how to do it first, then watch the video.

Start with your feet together

Lift your right heel, put your weight on your right toe, make sure your right knee is bent

Slide your left foot back (keep it flat) and keep your left leg very straight

When your left foot is all the way back, do the following all at once:

Put the right heel down by straightening the right leg
Put the left heel up by bending the left knee and shift your weight to the left toe. 
Now slide your right foot back and make sure it stays flat until it is all the way back.

Also make sure that your left knee stays bent and your left heel stays up until the right foot is all the way back.

Then shift your weight etc...


NOW, watch the video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EEynvjfljU

Remember, first time it&#39;s hard and confusing, but you will get it. It is very nice when you know how to do it. :D</description>
