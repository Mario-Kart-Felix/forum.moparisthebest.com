    <title>Torva Full Helm help (Delta 317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/torva-full-helm-help-delta-317/447266</link>
    <description>I need help coding my Torva Full helm, for some reason even though I&#39;ve tried adding it to &quot;Helm&quot; and &quot;Full Helm&quot; in Item.java, my Torva Full Helm still appears as a weapon, and it also appears as a Platebody, now at first I considered that I might have it grabbing the wrong model from the models folder, but than I realized that once I dropped it, it looks like the Torva full helm on the ground, so now I know it&#39;s taking the correct model. Any help? Please? I&#39;m thoroughly stumped.</description>
