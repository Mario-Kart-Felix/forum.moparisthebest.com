    <title>[508] How to make yourself Admin/Mod - for Amateurs [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-how-to-make-yourself-admin-mod-for-amateurs-508/356975</link>
    <description>Okay, i am pretty sure that there is already a tutorial somewhere on this, but it took me a long time to get the answer, and for some of you, you probably still don&#39;t know how exactly, so i decided to make this tutorial, this is my first tutorial by the way.


Okay well, first off you&#39;re going to want to open your source.

Now you are going to want to open, &quot;src&quot;.

Now open, &quot;Palidino76&quot;, or whatever the next folder is in your source.

Next open, &quot;rs2&quot;.

Finally open your, &quot;io&quot; folder, and open &quot;Login.java&quot; text document located inside.

A simpler method of getting to your login.java is to search for it in your source using search.

Once you are in, &quot;Login.java&quot; you are going to want to press &quot;ctrl+f&quot; on your keyboard to open up find.

Now there are to possible things to search for, if you know the previous owner&#39;s name, you can search

[code] &quot;NAMEHERE&quot; [/code]

But if you do not know the previous owners name you can search for...
[code]if (p.username.equals(&quot;[/code] instead.

Select, &quot;find next&quot; you will now be brought to the player rights.

The code should like like either
[code]	if (p.username.equals(&quot;UserName&quot;) || p.username.equals(&quot;username&quot;)) {
        	p.rights = 2;
	}[/code]

OR

[code]	if (p.username.equals(&quot;username&quot;)) {
        	p.rights = 2;
	}[/code]

Okay to make yourself owner you want to change the name in quotes(&quot; &quot;) to your name, here is an example if you were moparscape.

[code]	if (p.username.equals(&quot;MoparScape&quot;) || p.username.equals(&quot;moparscape&quot;)) {
        	p.rights = 2;
	}[/code]

The username in the first quotes is your exact username, then the username in the second quotes is your exact username EXCEPT in lowercase, if your username already is all lowercase, then this should work, as if your name would to be moparscape.

[code]	if (p.username.equals(&quot;moparscape&quot;)) {
        	p.rights = 2;
	}[/code]

Now  that&#39;s if you wanted to make yourself mod/admin, if you wanted to make your self mod then you would just change the
[code] p.rights = 2;[/code]
into
[code] p.rights = 1;[/code]

To add staff, simply just copy and paste the original code hit enter after } then paste, and change the username/rights if needed.
It  is recommended that if you are adding staff and the codes from previous staff are still there to just change the name in quotes and the rights if needed.

Okay after ALL of that work is complete, then you want to go into file, then select save.

Now you are going to want to close the text document and now run the compiler, some sources call it, &quot;compiler&quot; or &quot;compile&quot; or &quot;build&quot;
after you have run that, then run your server, then your client.
Now you can log in and you are now whatever you set your rights to!!! CONGRATS!!!

If you have done all this and it doesn&#39;t work, you don&#39;t understand, or you would like help, PLEASE ADD MY MSN, i would be glad to help!
