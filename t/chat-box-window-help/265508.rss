    <title>Chat box window! help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chat-box-window-help/265508</link>
    <description>Oh hi there. Didn&#39;t see you there. Anyways, I want to make it so when I click my runserver.bat, not only does my server window open but another window opens that redirects all the chat in-game to that box only. I want this because it will be easier to read what my players are saying without getting on the server myself and opening the chatlogs which takes around 10 minutes to load. How would I do this? I found out that all regular chat is packet 4. Here is the code that prints the text into my server window: [code]println_debug(
                        &quot;Text [&quot; + chatTextEffects + &quot;,&quot; + chatTextColor + &quot;]: &quot;
                        + misc.textUnpack(chatText, packetSize - 2));[/code] Here is my whole packet 4. [code]        case 4: // regular chat
            chatTextEffects = inStream.readUnsignedByteS();
            chatTextColor = inStream.readUnsignedByteS();
            chatTextSize = (byte) (packetSize - 2);
            if (muted == 1) {
                sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t talk because you are muted!&quot;);
            } else if (muted == 0) {
                inStream.readBytes_reverseA(chatText, chatTextSize, 0);
                chatTextUpdateRequired = true;
                println_debug(
                        &quot;Text [&quot; + chatTextEffects + &quot;,&quot; + chatTextColor + &quot;]: &quot;
                        + misc.textUnpack(chatText, packetSize - 2));
                chatlog();
                String playerchat = &quot;[&quot; + playerName + &quot;]: &quot;
                        + misc.textUnpack(chatText, packetSize - 2) + &quot;&quot;;
                // println_debug(&quot;Text [&quot;+chatTextEffects+&quot;,&quot;+chatTextColor+&quot;]: &quot;+misc.textUnpack(chatText, packetSize-2));
            }
	
            break;[/code] Now I wouldn&#39;t know how to direct chat into another box so two windows open when I go to run my server. But I&#39;m guessing you would use this to do it. I would also like the chat to stay in my primary window also. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.  :)

[u][b]EDIT:[/b][/u]

Could something also be made so when I click runserver.bat, it&#39;ll turn my server on like it normally does and then when I click something like chat.bat, then it will open that second window so I can make it an option whether or not I want that second window up?</description>
