<p>Ive had feeling of this before. Its so weird but interesting. These kinds of ideas is being put into movies more and more. Like at the end of the movie called Repo Men. The main character Saves countless lives, gets the girl, and live a good life. But we come to find out he is hooked up to a life preserver that implements a happly unrealistic life into his head. I know i just spoiled the ending to the movie but its still worth a watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it,</p>
