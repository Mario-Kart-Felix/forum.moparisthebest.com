    <title>Duelling - Challenge option doesn&#39;t appear</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/duelling-challenge-option-doesnt-appear/384668</link>
    <description>I downloaded RuneFX base and I plan to make some changes and increase my java knowledge, it&#39;s actually quite fun however I&#39;ve come to a brick wall I can assure you I&#39;ve tried my best with this.

My problem is:
In the duel arena there is no challenge option?, and in the bottom right hand corner the duel arena battle axe just flickers non stop? any ideas.

I contacted the server owner he said that &quot;The duel arena is quoted out go to client class&quot;
He didn&#39;t really explain it enough for me to fix the problem, know what he meant.

Does anyone have an idea on what I can do - Thanks.
Yours sincerely, Era</description>
