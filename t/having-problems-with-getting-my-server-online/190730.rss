    <description>I&#39;ve done everything, portfoward, no-ip and no-ip DUC, i have JDK 6u3 and it works proper

Portfoward

No-ip DUC

It lets people [b] under my internet connection get on using my Computers IP [/b] (the ip that i opened ports for) But it seems that my no-ip is useless and has no effect, how do i make my no-ip work so anyone could connect using my no-ip?

EDIT: I&#39;m getting off 2 go to bed so tomorrow i will check this out, also, before you post please take time 2 [b] read the whole thing [/b] and please no [b] spam [/b]</description>
