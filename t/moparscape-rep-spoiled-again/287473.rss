    <title>MoparScape Rep spoiled again?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/moparscape-rep-spoiled-again/287473</link>
    <description>I&#39;m only bringing this up because of the recent complains about the rep system. Many people here simply want the system removed altogether. Right now, almost no more polls are coming in about potential new vets, and rep is being handed out like it&#39;s nothing.

Okay, so we have had the rep on this website reset 2 times. I think we have some options:

[b]1. [/b]Leave it in the same, horrible state it&#39;s already in.
[b]2. [/b]Reset it again, and hope that everything works now.
[b]3. [/b]Add a [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1308]karma limitation[/url], where users can only add karma a certain number of times per topic/post/pm.
[b]4. [/b]We can switch to an [url=http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=1129]advanced reputation system[/url], one that lets moderators moderate reputation exchanges.
[b]5. [/b]We could possibly modify the Karma system to remain the same as it is now on moparisthebest.com, but change it back to single reputation points here. (this would make reputation slightly more meaningful)
[b]6. [/b]There is a modification for SMF that enables reputation to be given out only to topic starters, and not to the repliers. This may be an option to take to try and fix the reputation chaos.
[b]7. [/b]Change Vet requirements to exclude reputation, and be on a user-select basis.
[b]8. [/b]Change Vet system to applications instead of inside polls/discussions (or combine them).
[b]9. [/b]Only allow staff members, community members, and MoparScape Veterans to hand out reputation points.

In order to reply to this topic, simply type in whatever numbers above you agree with. Many of these can be used in combination, so post the numbers next to each other. If you think more should be added, say your part. There&#39;s no doubt this system needs to be changed, but there is many ways it can be changed.

Personally, I&#39;m for #s: [i]2,4[/i] or [i]2,5[/i]
I like the idea of having an applications system as well. We could like have people apply to become a Vet, then we vote on them. Or, we could just vote on every single person that reaches over 50 rep, but I think they should apply for it instead. Thus, I&#39;m also for numbers [i]2,5,8[/i]

What numbers are you for?</description>

thats the only issue, it would become like rep and get abused just as easily. Also our suggestions really need to be taken on board and acted on soon just to stop this spiralling shitsink</p>

              <p>I had another potential idea, if you make all rep modifications have to be authorised by a moderator it will restrict the abuse. With this used in conjunction with the rep one person per week idea this would be really good way of fixing all the reputation issues. It would be a bit more strain on the moderators (sorry guys) but if you bump a few more people into the position then you can keep the workload about the same as it is now (per moderator.) This way you can introduce negative rep. You asked for a way to stop the abusers on Storks thread Mitb and i think this is the best way</p>

<p>Rep can be given if you receive a PM from a user as well, it’s not just a post (I know this because I just tried it :D).  Honestly, like Moparisthebest said; who would actually want to go through the hassle of waiting a week to rep the same account?  Sure it’s been done before, but it’s not really a big deal.  If it’s abused, they can have a rep reset, simple as that.  I’d honestly wait until the switch to SMF 2.0 before we do anything with it though.</p>

<p>No, I think a minimum rep requirement is better than minimum posts.[/quote]</p>
<p>I was thinking in combination. It isn’t exactly difficult to get past the quiz, so any account with 0 posts and access to the forums have the potential for mass repping, once they themselves have enough.</p>

it is definitely because otherwise people would just make accounts and start doing a few posts and then repping themselves</p>

              <p>I like that idea as well, but maybe we could do a slight alteration to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, you can rep 1 more point for every 15 points you have. How about switching it to 1 point for every 50 points you have, and you are able to rep 1 person for every 7 days.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">or</span>
</li>
<li>Keeping rep to 1 point per time, but letting you rep 1 more person for every 50 points you have. So people at 200 could rep 4 people per 7 days, instead of the default 1.</li>

<p>you rep them the next week etc, you have to decide yourself who you think deservers it more.<br>
you should do it like this: after sunday at midnight (GMT EST or any other timezone it doesnt really matter) have the ability to rep for that week so you can wait right up until the next sunday to decide who gets your rep for that week, then again on that sunday at midnight it resets and you get the next week to decide again and so on</p>
