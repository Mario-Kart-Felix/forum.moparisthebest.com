    <description>problem # 1:

i recently found the coded for customs and i had a post about this before and it kind of helped me. the problem is that some of them items (bandos full helm, d pl8body) by default go into the &quot;weapons&quot; slot. there was also a problem with the d kiteshield and d cape but i figured those out. i put the ids in the appropriate places according to item classification in the item.java and item4.java files. 

problem # 2:

the custom weapons (d claws, god scimmy, bandos scimmy, ss, supreme claws, &amp;&amp; tri-godswords) dont work when i try to use them. what happens is when i go to attack it switched to a punch type attack and hardly do any damage which im guessing is just the punch attack itself, not the weapon. how would i get them to work?

problem # 3:
the custom weapons (stated above in the parentheses) special doesn&#39;t work. how would i get them to work?</description>
