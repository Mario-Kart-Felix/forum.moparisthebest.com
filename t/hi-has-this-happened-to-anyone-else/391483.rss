    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hi-has-this-happened-to-anyone-else/391483</link>
    <description>So there i am, on rsbots.net, i bought an autominer pro auth, so i go to yahoo mail and open my inbox, and i get this
&quot;Message from webpage
hi&quot;

So i close it, thinking &quot;wtf?&quot;

Then not even a second later, it comes up again, this time i had the option to click &quot;Dont show any more popup dialogs from this page&quot; or whatever, so i checked that and it didnt come up.. I searched it on google, lots of other people were having this problem.. no one has the answer.. Could my browser be infected?</description>
