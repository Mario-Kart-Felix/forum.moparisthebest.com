    <title>Anti-Flood ...Tried one, did nothing, Java programmer Pros Read</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anti-flood-tried-one-did-nothing-java-programmer-pros-read/359319</link>
    <description>Hey everyone...I can understand some actual JAVA programming, like the core stuff such as: Where to put things ect. , But I am not good at actually making code off the top of my head or with a little hint. Some of you may say I fail at JAVA...I do...I can do all the basic server stuff. Look at some code similar to useing Item on Item and change it to where it works. I can do those things, but I want to know how to make particular JAVA programming code. 

Reality: I came home today from a waterpolo game hoping to add new updates to my awsome 562 that I have been working on. I just bought a VPS and it works awsome. When I get home, Server is crashed. I get it online again and the flooders are still flooding (Online 1, Online 2, Online 75)...I tried looking for an Anti-flooder code for a 562...Found one...attempted to put it in the right place.Compiled fine but did nothing. I tried to code an antiflood. No success at all...I just sat there with blank notepad open thinking. 

What I need Your Help For: I need someone to actually teach me/break down an antiflood code for a 562 so that I understand how it is actually made. I am serious about this and I am willing to pay a few dollars for you to help me. No, I don&#39;t want to buy a 562 anti-flood code for $3...I want to learn how to make one for $3 or $5 (Paypal)...Because then I am losing money by buying a VPS and my server isn&#39;t running to accept donations because of people who love my server. My players are also not happy and It is all upon my shoulders and I need someones help to show me how to make a working anti-flooder for a 562.


Please I am really determined and I need someone fast :)
Help me please.

I did have 30 players online during the day and around 15-20 during the night so that is why I got a VPS because my player cunt was increasing dramatically, then once the flooders came…hardly anyone is on…So this will be like a new start…</p>

              <p>thats a cheap way of fixing the flooding problem. now your other player can not connect to your server as well…if u had any. make sure to go to the link on how to remove norton and then try reinstalling zone alarm or the other one mentioned above. ccleaner is fantastic! you will love it. the first scan will take 5 min after than it takes 20 seconds. make sure to use the “clean” taB ASWELL AS THE “REGESTRY TAB” on ccleaner. it will give u the option to backup your regestery just click no.</p>

Simply right click on them, click add rule, then click Allow to change it to Deny.<br>
They can’t ever connect again as long as your firewall is on.<br>
Also remember to be in the NETWORK ACTIVITY section of Outpost and to click the + button next to the application to see the individual IPs or you might screw up your server.</p>

              <p>one of the best firewalls which most top servers use is called zonealarm. it is used to stop mass connections from the same ip and to actually ip ban the ipaddress form your router not your exact computer. because most anti-flooder codes just block the connections to that exact computer or if u have a vps it blocks the server but the connection is still going through your router causing loads of traffic. every connection that connects to your server comes from a remote computer sent to there router and through there modem and from there goes through your modem Then your router (where you port forwarded from) then to the ip you port forwarded to which is the computer running the server. so now that you know how some one connects to your computer you can understand how unsafe still anti-flooder’s built into your servers files is. so after all that chat just download zone alarm and all your problems are fixed. btw zone alarm is 100% free</p>

              <p>Hey everyone…I can understand some actual JAVA programming, like the core stuff such as: Where to put things ect. , But I am not good at actually making code off the top of my head or with a little hint. Some of you may say I fail at JAVA…I do…I can do all the basic server stuff. Look at some code similar to useing Item on Item and change it to where it works. I can do those things, but I want to know how to make particular JAVA programming code.</p>
<p>Reality: I came home today from a waterpolo game hoping to add new updates to my awsome 562 that I have been working on. I just bought a VPS and it works awsome. When I get home, Server is crashed. I get it online again and the flooders are still flooding (Online 1, Online 2, Online 75)…I tried looking for an Anti-flooder code for a 562…Found one…attempted to put it in the right place.Compiled fine but did nothing. I tried to code an antiflood. No success at all…I just sat there with blank notepad open thinking.</p>
<p>What I need Your Help For: I need someone to actually teach me/break down an antiflood code for a 562 so that I understand how it is actually made. I am serious about this and I am willing to pay a few dollars for you to help me. No, I don’t want to buy a 562 anti-flood code for $3…I want to learn how to make one for $3 or $5 (Paypal)…Because then I am losing money by buying a VPS and my server isn’t running to accept donations because of people who love my server. My players are also not happy and It is all upon my shoulders and I need someones help to show me how to make a working anti-flooder for a 562.</p>
<p>Please I am really determined and I need someone fast <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Help me please.<br>
