              <p>It sounds like English; it even looks like English, but I can’t understand a word you’re blabbering. Try learning elementary grammar before attempting to inflict your next literary abomination on moparscape.</p>
<p>I notice that you never let an idea interrupt the flow of your posts. Generally, there is nothing wrong with having nothing worthwhile to say - unless you insist on saying it. However, I’ll consider letting you have the last word if you guarantee it will be your last. You bring to mind a quote from Josh Billing: “Doesn’t know much, but leads the league in nostril hair.”</p>
<p>Reading your post is less interesting than watching paint dry. If wit was spit, your mouth would be drier than a shallow well in an African heat wave. If I had wanted to talk to somebody with your personality, I would be at the damn pet store talking to the lizards. Maybe you wouldn’t come across as such a jellyfish-sucking mental midget if you weren’t so dumb that even blondes tell jokes about you; if your weren’t so fat that buildings bounce when you haul your Sumo Wrestler mass down the street, or if you didn’t have a face that could be used as an alternative to a stomach pump. No, come to think of it, you would.</p>
<p>In future, if you have something to say, just shut up.</p>
