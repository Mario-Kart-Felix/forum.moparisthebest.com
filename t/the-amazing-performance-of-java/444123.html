<p>I found this benchmark quite interesting. I rewrote it all based on the picture and tested it. I made the benchmark run for 40 times consecutively - always regenerating the random elements of input arrays a and b to eliminate the possibility of cached results. The first few runs are all around 18600ms. It needs 4 runs to “warm up”, after that it gains a speedup of 800ms (4%) and no further improvements are made.</p>
<p>Would you like to desribe what you think the JIT compiler’s optimizer can do? A lot of people seem to think JIT compilation is some ultimate process. In reality they have been brainwashed by the promoters of managed languages. I’ll hold back my viewpoint on this because I really would like to see how you define optimization.</p>

<p>Are you implying that the hotspot compiler has no impact on performance? Let me ask you, how do <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> define optimization? Are you naive enough to think it’s only related to cpu time on a specific task? Optimization is a focus of prioritizing one aspect of runtime or compile time, which is well beyond the scope of just cpu time (if that’s what you would presume). I may optimize memory monitoring (and subsequently, garbage collection), at a cost of extra memory and perhaps cpu time. I may optimize compile time at the expense of runtime (or vice versa) by compiling to a simpler, high-level language and interpreting it, which also allows for easy architecture retargetting. I may optimize abstraction in a language design at the expense of offering no low-level functional support and, rather, provide an easy-to-use object oriented syntactical paradigm.</p>
<p>Most of what I just mentioned vaguely outlined the Java programming language (and several others at the same time). Would you have considered any of those aspects to be “optimizations?” If it’s just down to cpu time (as you implied in this topic), then go ahead and use C for everything. Hell, you might as well use raw assembly on the off chance you are able to make it go a few microseconds faster than optimized and compiled gcc binary.</p>
<p>If you were a wise programmer, you’d realize that “optimizing” your program involves asking many questions and making many decisions, the least of which is cpu time. If you wanted to make a very fast math library and wanted to do it at the assembly level, it could take you months before it would target several different popular architectures. The higher the level of language you use though, the faster you will be able to program it. With some languages, this is at the expense of performance. If you used Java, then you save the development time of writing a needed or unneeded memory handler, among other concepts. If you use C++, you have more you have to write, but more control over the end program.</p>
<p>I could probably go on for several hours on this topic and be redundant as hell. The point is, it’s the same naivete as thinking there is one universally “good” language for every solution. It’s project-specific and depends heavily on the application in question and what aspects you want to be most efficient.</p>

Would you have considered any of those aspects to be “optimizations?” If it’s just down to cpu time (as you implied in this topic), then go ahead and use C for everything. Hell, you might as well use raw assembly on the off chance you are able to make it go a few microseconds faster than optimized and compiled gcc binary.</p>
<p>If you were a wise programmer, you’d realize that “optimizing” your program involves asking many questions and making many decisions, the least of which is cpu time. If you wanted to make a very fast math library and wanted to do it at the assembly level, it could take you months before it would target several different popular architectures. The higher the level of language you use though, the faster you will be able to program it. With some languages, this is at the expense of performance. If you used Java, then you save the development time of writing a needed or unneeded memory handler, among other concepts. If you use C++, you have more you have to write, but more control over the end program.</p>
<p>I could probably go on for several hours on this topic and be redundant as hell. The point is, it’s the same naivete as thinking there is one universally “good” language for every solution. It’s project-specific and depends heavily on the application in question and what aspects you want to be most efficient.[/quote]</p>
<p>What you have there is a tl;dr lecture on power/performance vs developer productivity (I read it anyway). Totally unrelated to my previous post, the only related sentence is the one I highlighted in bold - therefore I’m going to reply to that part only. I’m glad you didn’t go as far as explaining the word “optimization” in every possible area of life where the word has a meaning.</p>
<p>Did I say that a JIT optimizer produces no side effects? No.</p>
<p>My previous post was about the fact that most java fanboys believe that the JIT compiler is some mysterious tool that does “this and that” - and since it performs the optimizations at runtime it must spit out extraordinary machine code - it doesn’t. A C++ compiler does “this and that” too and even more. It’s just funny how the java fanboys go on about their theoretical jitters. Let’s look at the benchmarks, alright. And guess what, my imaginary static C++ compiler will always be better than the imaginary java jitters.</p>

<p>I think you’re being foolish here. Are you claiming that all the software development companies out there that use C++ are doing it wrong because they’re not using managed languages that would help them be more productive? Those companies obviously have already done the “this versus that” analysis and the decision was C++. There are areas where native code is the only option.

<p>I don’t know if you’ve noticed that native code is getting more and more attention lately. Google and Apple are developing an entire new compiler for C++ - Clang. In the mobile space native code is the only option if you want to have a unified code base, minus the glue code. Lately expressions such “performance per watt” and “performance per user” have emerged. I suggest reading about C++ usage at Facebook, mainly the interviews given by Andrei Alexandrescu. At this point their back-end is entirely C++ and the front-end PHP code is automatically translated into C++. This allows them to run on only a small fraction of the servers that would be necessary to run a 100% PHP codebase.</p>

<p>I am familiar with clang. The point of it is to simplify a lot of what was difficult to work with before. You can’t simply solve all of the pure-native issues with a brand new compiler, though. These are conceptual differences that have their limitations.</p>
<p>And perhaps you ultimately missed my point. I was not arguing against C++ once in this topic. I was stating there are times to use a more powerful yet more difficultly managed language and there are times to not. Facebook did not originate on such concepts, they only decided to move to them later on. Hell, they could have used a popular mono project which contains a php engine that dynamically compiles the php to CIL bytecode and lets the mono runtime deal with it. I guarantee that solution would be very close in performance but yet it’s magically in a managed language. :o If they had decided against using that approach and wanted to spend the extra time writing their own backend, that’s fine too. Either way, they had more reasons than even you probably know in choosing their exact solution.</p>
