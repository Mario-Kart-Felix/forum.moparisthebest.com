    <title>Adsense ban triggers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adsense-ban-triggers/354223</link>
    <description>I got banned from adsense like 5 years ago for being a moron and clicking my ads, but I want to re-register. I&#39;m going to uni soon so I&#39;ll have a completely new address, new phone number and an IP based 300 miles away. I&#39;ll also show ads from a different site than the banned one. I can set up a new bank account, too.

Will I still be able to register under the same name? I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t have a persons name as a ban trigger because there are so many people with the same name, but everyone I ask says you have to use someone else&#39;s name. Is this true?</description>

              <p>I never got asked for that when I registered the first time, probably because I’m in the UK? I remember signing my name on the bottom of a form, agreeing that I’m based outside the USA and something to do with not paying tax.</p>
