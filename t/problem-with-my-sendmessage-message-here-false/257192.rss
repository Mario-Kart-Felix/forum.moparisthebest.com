    <title>Problem with my &quot;sendmessage (&quot;message here&quot;) = false&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-my-sendmessage-message-here-false/257192</link>
    <description>Yeah I tried to delete this:
[code]sM(&quot;my message here&quot;);[/code]

and simply did:
[code]sM(&quot;&quot;);[/code]

which still sent a message in game of just a blank line. I moved on to doing this:
[code]sM(&quot;&quot;) = false;[/code]

and compiled and got:
[code]client.java6774: unexpected type
required: variable
found     :  value
        sM(&quot;&quot;) = false;
            ^[/code]

I&#39;ve tried adding the bracket but it didn&#39;t work but I&#39;m not positive I did it right. 

EDIT: Most people nowadays on Moparscape don&#39;t know what the hell this means. If you answer it, then you should know that you know SOMETHING about private servers. This is a simple question, probably something extremely easy to answer for people from old Mopar.</description>
