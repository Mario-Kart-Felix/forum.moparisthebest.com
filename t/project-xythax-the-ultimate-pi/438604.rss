[hr]
Hello there, MoparScape and welcome to my Development Thread.
[b]Why are you doing this?[/b]
I&#39;m fed up of people criticising the Project Insanity base. This, is why I&#39;m creating this source. Project Insanity obviously has some major flaws, but these can be fixed, there are spoonfed tutorials everywhere on it. So I&#39;m starting off with the original PI base by Sanity and I&#39;m making this into a brilliant source, for all to revel in and use, I [b]will[/b] be releasing this as soon as it&#39;s completed. Project Insanity has some good aspects to it, but all over the RSPS world, there are hundreds of tutorials on improving this base, there&#39;s absolutely everything, if someone just put their mind to it and followed even 50 of these tutorials they&#39;d have a pretty great base on their hands. I am, however, going to programming a lot of this custom, and not following tutorials. I may follow them for guidance, but 90% of the new code will be written by me, just inspired by tutorials.
[hr]
[b]Who else is doing this with you?[/b]
No-one, this will be a solo project.
[hr]
[b]What are you starting with and what&#39;s your plan?[/b]
I&#39;m starting with the original Project Insanity server and client released by Sanity, Sanity is the creator of this base for those of you who do not know.

I’m not trying to bring the project down but the title is miss leading for the sheer fact there will never be an “Ultimate PI” because its main stream and over used.<br>

<p>This is the Server Development section, not the Server Development teams section.  You can’t request for a team in this section, this is only to display your project or to show off some kind of server or aspect of your server.[/quote]</p>
<p>In reply to the quote from dj, I’ll say the same to you.<br>
There aren’t any tutorials to show them, no, but once you’ve read through most of the other tutorials even if you’re a beginner at Java, then you begin to get an understanding and you start to screw around with the codes in it, of course, this is only if you wish to actually learn something, you must have a sense of motivation about you to start looking into guides, not just for servers, but for the whole language of java.</p>
<p>As for the development team, I’ll remove that, my bad.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just because it’s over used doesn’t mean it’s not good. PI has some good aspects to it, and if you just put some work into it then you’re a mile ahead of everyone else who uses it. I’m hoping that when I’m done with this it partly makes people realise that it’s not the base, it’s the programmer.</p>
