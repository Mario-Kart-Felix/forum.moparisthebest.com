    <title>Uploading A Download Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/uploading-a-download-client/406326</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I just need some help on uploading my download client. I have both the source and the client, and I also have the server online. My router is also portforwarded. What I&#39;m looking to do is make the server that I am currently on, public so other people can play it. I&#39;ve tried converting my client file into a .rar file so I can upload it to uppit, but when people downloaded it, it said error connecting to server... So can anyone help me upload the download client so other people can play it?

Thanks,

Anthony</description>
