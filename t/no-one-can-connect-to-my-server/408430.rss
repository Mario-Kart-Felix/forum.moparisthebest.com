    <description>[center][b]I have port forwarded, and canyouseeme.org can see me on port 43594. I&#39;ve put my no-ip into the client.java folder, and yes I compiled. I&#39;ve restarted my router, I&#39;ve restarted my computer, no-ip DUC is updating my host, I&#39;ve tried having uTorrent on and off, but every time I try to log on it says &quot;No response from server. Please try using a different world&quot;. [/b][/center]


[center]I&#39;m getting very sick and tired of asking people how to fix this. I have asked and asked, but NO ONE has made an attempt at helping me.

[b]TELL ME WHAT I AM DOING WRONG. PLEASE.[/b][/center]</description>

              <p>I am 100% sure. I have been viewing EVERY thread that seems similar to mine. I done EVERYTHING people have suggested in other threads. But there is NOTHING here about what my issue is. And no one is willing to go on teamviewer to see for themselves what the problem is.</p>
<p>I NEED to get this server up. There are people who are really counting on me to get this done. But I am just stumped.</p>

              <p>Okay that’s very wierd, are you sure ports are forwarded correctly if you can log on locally but not from outside your router?</p>

              <p>That’s the exact same issue I have, the client works with the source, just not when I try to connect with No-Ip… I can only connect as localhost. I used to have a working server, but I quit for awhile… Now I’m wishing I hadn’t . I just need someone to Teamviewer with me.</p>

              <p>No, that is not the issue. I’ve been able to connect to it before, but now I can’t. It only does this when I try to move from using a local IP, to a custom IP (the no-ip). The client works for the source. That is not the issue.</p>

<p>What I think may be happening here is you are running an older client with a newer source, For example 317 client on 508 source.</p>
