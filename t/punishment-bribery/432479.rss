    <description>I&#39;m not sure I like this new trend,

http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,534999.0.html

Paying 20 diamonds for someone to remove a report and pretend it never happened, I don&#39;t know but that doesn&#39;t seem very justified to me. I don&#39;t like how this is going basically if someone where to burn down an entire city and he paid the owner e.g. 50 xrayed diamonds he would then apparently not be banned because he was pardoned. 

It seems like a way to just profit expensive, cheated materials from griefers instead of enforcing the rules correctly.</description>

<p>Also, look away from the abuse part - The server rules MUST be enforced that’s what they’re there for.</p>

              <p>Yes, if someone griefs anothers property the intention to do harm is still there. Simply saying “Pay me 20 diamonds and we’ll pretend it never happened” isn’t working for me. It also opens the possibility to manipulation e.g.</p>
<p>Pay me 5 diamonds a week or I bring the report back up and you’ll be banned.</p>
<p>Basically it gives idiots like Agl power over people who made a mistake, or power over griefers in general. It also isn’t setting the rules of the server at all it’s basically saying you can grief, if you have enough diamonds to pay the person to shut up.</p>

<p>But basically you want it so the state(game staff) can press charges even if the plaintiff(agl) decides to drop it and accept payment(bribe) from the defendant<br>
