    <title>If you have trouble portforwarding. (Click here)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-you-have-trouble-portforwarding-click-here/267258</link>
    <description>   Hello, In the past I have had trouble with portforwarding I kept asking around on here as well as on &quot;Portforward.Com.&quot;

   However, I found that no one seems to want to help with this problem, So I decided to contact my Router&#39;s provider for example my router is a &quot;Intellinet, Active networking&quot; Just type in your companys name, and then select &quot;Support.&quot; 

   Well, Hope I helped someone :).

                                                                        ~Sincerly~ Microsoft1.</description>
