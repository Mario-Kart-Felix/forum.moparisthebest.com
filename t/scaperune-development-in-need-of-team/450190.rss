First of all I don’t think I’ve seen the name anywhere but I’ll check thanks for that.<br>
Second of all look at where I put that part it was on “Advertisement/gfx:” I don’t know how to use photoshop, I’m sorry if I don’t meet your standards,  anything related I use paint, why would I try to coding a server if all I could use was paint ? but you must have misunderstood, and I’m not “inexperienced” not trying to claim I’m pro either.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re welcome for the post, I can promise you that the name is taken 100 times over. Still, I wouldn’t list your age, that might turn some Developers off who might otherwise be interested. Also, replace every time you say “coders” with “programmers”.</p>
