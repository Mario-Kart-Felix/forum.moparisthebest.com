    <description>

Before my retirement in runescape I use to be the owner of a smart clan. All the members in the clan became rich because of my pking technique. I now yall will be the first ones to know about it step by step.

Ok first off you don’t realy need a clan just maybe 5 friends, a mage with atleas 70 mage because you’ll need fire blast and bind. Also your other friends should be strong in a skill like around 80-90. Ok your friends and walk to the giants then go up a lil more. You’ll need to be at a specific spot and its located over lev 20 so the players cant tele. Ok when your there make a death dot= when all the players are on top of each other to make it look like theres one player there.

Ok now get the lowest player in your team to lure. It has to be a mage and around lev 70. And you should wear a good items to make them follow you. It shouldn’t be too rare or it’ll be too risky so the item I used to use was a blue mage t top. Ok now walk to the giants and if your luck a player would start attacking you. So run to your friends and the best place were your friends are located is that the guy following you wont see them immediately cause they are at a high point. Ok so the enemy is following you the moment you see the your friends white dot in the mini map bind the enemy! That’s when your friend will start attacking him. Keep binding him till he’s dead don’t let him pass lev 20 or he’ll tele. 

Ok after your have lure everyone in that world walk with your friends all the way to the back of the wild were the demons are located. Ok there is were every clan makes the biggest mistake! They raid the house located by the demons were some people hang out. The problem doing that is when people see like 5 white dots in there mini map running to them they’ll log out and that’ll be a waste of time. Ok what you should do is send your lowest member with a lot of food and of course if there are people by the demons they are going to attack him. So while being attack he should run to the team and that makes it the enemy not able to log out. 



After your done all that go back to the “luring spot” and hop worlds. When my clan did all this we pked like 20 sets of rune a day. 

Hope it helps</description>

Lures are too obvious, how about you just train to 99 range and mage, and go own them.<br>
