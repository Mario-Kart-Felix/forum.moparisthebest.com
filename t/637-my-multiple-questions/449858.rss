    <title>[637] My multiple questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/637-my-multiple-questions/449858</link>
    <description>I&#39;m tired of starting new threads, because I feel like &#39;tard. (I am a &#39;tard for these questions..)

1. Help me add shops. (&#39;tard)

2. I added objects to the ground (mining rocks) and the rocks only let me mine the iron and coal rocks.. WHY.

3. My npc def editor doesn&#39;t work. WHY.

4. These items in the PK shop are bought with PK Tokens. It says you buy them with GP because it has the GP symbol next to it.. yet you still buy it with the same amount of PK tokens.. how do I make it show as my PK token?

5. The people at GWD can attack through the wall before you even get inside, how can I fix that?

If you know any of these answers, please reply with the number to the answer..
Thanks for any help!</description>
