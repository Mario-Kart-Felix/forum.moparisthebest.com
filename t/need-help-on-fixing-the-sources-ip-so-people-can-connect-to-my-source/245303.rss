[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 19, 2008, 11:29:42 pm[/size][hr]Er.. i tried to connect with my client, which is already set up to connect to my no-ip and has worked on my other source, when i go to connect to my server says &quot; error connecting to the server&quot;.. Er, this is why i was curious if i have to change anything in the source to connect to my no-ip, like i had to do with my client.</description>
