    <description>[center][b]A new Canadian tool can re-grow teeth![/b][/center]

Amazing. Canadians are really getting good. Canadians stocks are rising, 36 Canadian Theators are goign to get nominated for a prize, and captured many terrorists. Well anyways back to the article.

Yes the canadian tool can re-grow teeth! In the article, it said that it should be ideal for hockey players and sugar lovers. 

A partial quote from the article on how it works:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Chen helped create the tiny ultrasound machine that gently massages gums and stimulates tooth growth from the root once inserted into a person&#39;s mouth, mounted on braces or a removable plastic crown.

The wireless device, smaller than a pea, must be activated for 20 minutes each day for four months to stimulate growth, he said.

It can also stimulate jawbone growth to fix a person&#39;s crooked smile and may eventually allow people to grow taller by stimulating bone growth, Chen said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yay! No more crooked smiles or small teeth with relaxed gums from all those massages... sounds good. :D
