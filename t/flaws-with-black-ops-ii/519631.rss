    <title>Flaws with Black Ops II</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flaws-with-black-ops-ii/519631</link>
    <description>1. Anyone on your team sucks, you have no defense from spy planes unless your level 55.
2. Riot campers
3. Dieing when enemy is not even around corner yet.
4. Their too good of lobby placement system.
Let me explain:
 Ooh great, always get the best lobby possible! my max connection is probably half (at best, on a good day) of anyone elses. so every game i join, i am the ONLY person with connection that is not 4bar. its great,... for them. 

My transfer from black ops to black ops 2 was very unpleasant dropping my 5.0 ratio on BO to a .5 on BOII. sounds amazing right? Granted they had good intentions with the lobby connections but seriously.. I think when the community argued for &quot;better connection&quot; they didn&#39;t expect everyone to get better connections lol. (just them)
I can&#39;t even play normal team deathmatch because every game i join it kicks me from the game, (loads...something with syncing settings...then kicked) Says host migration every time, then kicks me after 20 seconds. I can play the arms race at the moment but it is where everyone went to rank up quickly &gt;.&gt; (especially the people that know what their doing, because noobs cant find that lobby.. they want usual tdm).

I get stuck in lobbies, with lower connection, and get shot before enemies comes around corner (and if i run out of the way, it throws me back in to their sight to kill me). So any chance of me doing good at the moment is out the window. 
Connection is mainly a problem because i use fal, put 6 rounds in guys chest, then die without a hitmarker. (happens ALOT on hijacked)
With the fal i actually started going positive, because i am usually a sniper but no good snipers unlocked yet :( and the FAL is similar to a sniper, and has fast fire, and aims faster :D
 Their pros are all cons to me lol.
you have any problems with BOII? post.</description>

              <p>I assumed everyone knew what lag comp is, feel free to youtube it; I never knew I was expected to educate people in that respect (basic explanation, the videos on Youtube explain it better I feel <a href="http://www.callofduty.com/thread/200565548" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.callofduty.com/thread/200565548</a>).</p>
<p>Edinburgh (the capital I live in…) has the best average internet speed in Britain as an average, I’m not sure about other statistics. I’m with one of the better ISPs (some claim best, I highly dispute that). I have one of the better routers (few hardware problems that I discovered after a traceroute but they don’t hinder my usable speed noticeably of course). I have a very good internet package. I live pretty close to the exchange center (I think it’s called) as I live in the city center. I am in the prime location for a good internet connection and I have made sure I have gotten one due to my gaming and other family members and their excessive downloading/streaming in the past effecting this in a negative way. It’s up to you whether you believe I have good interwebs or not, I have many other reasons I could explain but it doesn’t really matter as it was to back up a claim.</p>
<p>If you don’t still believe I know lag comp very well. How about 32+ (I stayed at lvl 80 non prestige + 10th prestige for a while) prestiges in mw3 (my most played cod ofc)?<br>
99% of the time people blame their shitty tactics on lag comp. I.e. I miss a lot of hardscopes in mw3 because I unintentionally move when I snipe a lot (I don’t think I fully rest the joystick) but a lot of the time I’ll blame it on lag comp and have seen my friends do the exact same thing. You can’t prevent lag comp but you can make it so 70% of the time (estimate) you won’t die from it. Simple tactics like excessively ads’ing help stop you dying due to lag comp. It’s not fun (for me at least that’s why I only do things like that when I’m tryharding, but it works; then again what I’m saying is for most people is tips to being a ‘better’ player).</p>

              <p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:35, topic:519631”]Lag comp isn’t that bad, I have good internet (proof that’s it’s good : <a href="http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/6010/speedj.png" rel="nofollow noopener">http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/6010/speedj.png</a> , this is with me running programmes and five other devices possibly using accessing the internet as well), now we can establish that I must get lag comp a lot (most people with good internet have a ping of around 20 normally, mine is around 7 normally to put it into perspective for you).<br>
I can tell you right now lag comp isn’t bad at all if you play ‘tactically’. Personally, I don’t find playing tactically fun at all so I don’t follow my own advice however I know it works for sure unless your playing against tryhards as basically playing tactically is a form of tryharding.<br>
You guys shouldn’t whine so much about it, wait a year till you get matched with people who don’t live in your city/town etc then you’ll seriously start feeling the lag comp.</p>
<p>If your rushing around (like I do) suck it up, you can get around it. If you’ve got bad ping, you can’t really do much about that; that’s something which is reasonable to complain about.<br>
You might say lag comp in itself is a right to complain however it feels like bad players are just blaming everything on the lag comp.[/quote]</p>
<p>You said lag comp many times, and never quite said what it is. I know there is some sort of “lag compensation” on MW3 because it will “try” to even out players connections, but the host always has better connection still, regardless.<br>
and your 6-20 ms ping must be on a very small data size. Try with 100 bytes or better, and our connection comes through our phone-line (like dial-up, but uses splitter) so that limits it as well.</p>

I can tell you right now lag comp isn’t bad at all if you play ‘tactically’. Personally, I don’t find playing tactically fun at all so I don’t follow my own advice however I know it works for sure unless your playing against tryhards as basically playing tactically is a form of tryharding.<br>
You guys shouldn’t whine so much about it, wait a year till you get matched with people who don’t live in your city/town etc then you’ll seriously start feeling the lag comp.</p>
<p>If your rushing around (like I do) suck it up, you can get around it. If you’ve got bad ping, you can’t really do much about that; that’s something which is reasonable to complain about.<br>
You might say lag comp in itself is a right to complain however it feels like bad players are just blaming everything on the lag comp.</p>

<p>[quote=“heroisgay, post:20, topic:519631”]1. Your teammates on average are usually going to suck, this wouldn’t change for any Call of Duty game. Your best bet is to make friends with other players, and eventually only play with a party or full party- I rarely play anymore but in any Call of Duty I usually dominate in a full party, and do above average solo.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Some form of this has been in every mainstream CoD game and if they took it out it would reappear in a different form.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.This is probably a connection issue, on your screen the enemy isn’t around the wall yet on theirs he’s already there- again nothing to do with Bops2 in particular.</p>
<p>My only real problems with Bops2 is I found it mostly boring and connections are always an issue. Nothing out of the ordinary for a CoD though, they’re more fun imo when you’re in a full party.[/quote]<br>
if i pull out an automatic (last night) i realised i rape :l made 4 parties rage quit and the host migration was aborted, so didnt even get to keep my ratios lol. So its a lose-lose for me :\</p>
<p>[quote=“Dustin Gowler, post:26, topic:519631”]I don’t play bo2 i still play mw2,</p>
<p>kd mw2 1.5  i play domination and run and gun the whole time i win pretty much every game… my team hasnt lost in over 200 games.</p>
<p>i have a k/d of .6 on bo2 and a w/l of .5 its impossible to get a good team or a good connection.[/quote]<br>
i got a 1.01 on BO2 or something like that. (last i checked) but i started overkill hybriding with my dsr50{ballistics} and fal{select fire, target finder} and at least breaking even every game, i think a major part of it is getting used to the maps and using my radar. If i don’t know their coming, my connection wont let me kill them<br>
[ I am clearly shooting before them on my screen, on their screen i havnt fired a shot in the killcam]<br>
And one more thing i hope people need to realise, anyone who lives in town is more likely to have a really low PING. Most cases (ping&lt;=40 ms) 60 at worst.<br>
For me the ping is (pings DNS host) 152ms. And that is a basic ping (32 bytes data).<br>
4bar connection isnt based on connection rate, it is based on ping. so until my internet provider installs a booster closer to our house, there is no chance of me getting better connection.</p>
<p>So with this scenario, your at worst 60ms ping: your TTY connection is 60 to the server, 60 back. (120 ms total) and you can send more data. for me i have 152 ms to server, 152 ms back so i am waiting 304ms for a data packet, and since it sends one with every bullet, the most often i can send a “bullet” is every 300ms :<br>
but the difference is about 180ms (how much sooner you can see me, and react)<br>
which is still only .18 seconds, but in the world of reactions times, that is a lot.<br>
and for the most part, before my second bullet can even send my ps3 recieves the “dead” packet so it will null any future packets of mine, meaning my bullets will not hit you, in medal of honor, they dont have this. and every time i die, i also take the other guy with me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>[quote=“Arcik, post:3, topic:519631”]black peniss got you too?</p>
<p>I play with crap speed and I don’t get any connection problems. Maybe they just don’t like you? :p[/quote]</p>
<p>You live closer to town?<br>
I don’t know about you, but being 21 i dont have $150,000 laying around to go buy a new house in order to get better internet.<br>
This is the only speed offered at our distance.</p>

<p>I know, what I meant is you likely wont find players able to do that often, so your best bet is finding people to play with. Randoms have always and will always be bad on average as a team.</p>

              <p>[quote=“heroisgay, post:20, topic:519631”]1. Your teammates on average are usually going to suck, this wouldn’t change for any Call of Duty game. Your best bet is to make friends with other players, and eventually only play with a party or full party- I rarely play anymore but in any Call of Duty I usually dominate in a full party, and do above average solo.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Some form of this has been in every mainstream CoD game and if they took it out it would reappear in a different form.</li>
</ol>
<p>3.This is probably a connection issue, on your screen the enemy isn’t around the wall yet on theirs he’s already there- again nothing to do with Bops2 in particular.</p>
<p>My only real problems with Bops2 is I found it mostly boring and connections are always an issue. Nothing out of the ordinary for a CoD though, they’re more fun imo when you’re in a full party.[/quote]<br>
If you’re playing games like domination, demolition, etc. The ones with different objectives rather than killing, you need to work as a team to win.</p>

<p>I’ll have to hop online and browse my Recent’s. I know what map it was on and what game mode, that’ll save some time.</p>

I found it. Total effing bullshit!</p>
