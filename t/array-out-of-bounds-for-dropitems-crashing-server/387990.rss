    <title>Array out of bounds for dropitems crashing server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/array-out-of-bounds-for-dropitems-crashing-server/387990</link>
    <description>Can anyone tell me how to fix this as it keeps crashing my server. Although i don&#39;t know where to fix it i believe its got to do with the item id of a drop being outside a certain number and i need to redefine that number somewhere (just taking a stab so could be wrong).

Just added new drop 6183 (frog token to some monsters, to use with a random item chest) so not sure why thats causing it.
