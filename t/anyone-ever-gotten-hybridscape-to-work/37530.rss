    <title>Anyone ever gotten Hybridscape to work?</title>

    <description>Has anybody ever gotten Hybridscape to work for them?
Theres a bug in the savefile, which keeps users from logging on, they just throw an exception and d/c.
I tried *coughdecompilingcough* the hybridscape out of Moparscape, and putting the savefile code in there with some modifications, but still no luck.</description>
