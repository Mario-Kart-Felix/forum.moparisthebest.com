    <description>k well i was browsn thru rsmv for a bit nd i came across r prtty nice looking pl8, maybe a fuller version of the torso iunno, but i messed round with it, added wings, some primitives and coloured it and i came with this:

[IMG]http://i205.photobucket.com/albums/bb170/shadowfire38/09-04-16215620.png[/img]


Plz note, i take bout... erm... iunno... %25 credit? :S, for the recolour, lil bit of add ons etc, nd %70 for jagex, for the items and %5 for the epic tuts on mopar :],

//=====\\
Advice Time
//=====\\

Now i was hoping to recieve some advice on what i should do, idc for harsh critism, this is my 2nd time using meta,other than the basic recolours(a robin for example), and i personally &lt;3 this pl8.

{//==-==\\}
Help Time
{//==-==\\}

k well, ever since i started with meta, and recolouring i could never figure out how to animate something, so i was wondering if anyone could give me a quick tut on how to animate this pl8 and if possible capes, or a link to a tut, it would b the biggest help ever and if it works ill rep++ :D

Updates:D

<p>wow. some1 cant handle a little critism. get the fuck off these forums. nobody enjoys your shit recolors. NOTHING that has to do with a jagex model could EVER be epic. Ofcourse you can use the word epic all you want, but everyone will be like "wow what a fag if he thinks thats epic he must have the mind of a 6 year old. heres an idea: grab a shovel, hire some1 to help u dig a hole, jump in and tell him to bury you. some1 who uses “epic” as much as you must be a 4foot10 kid with 2 inch thick glasses. tell me: how often does ur mom abandon u at a bus stop?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>lmfao wow it takes a no life to say shit like that, actin tough behind a cp gj nerd. nd fyi dont pick a fight u cant win  cause u kno deep inside ur shitty life u kno u have no chance at anything. 4’10? thats not too short so like wtf? theres tons of 4"10 ppl that prob have a better life than u and prob could get a job anywhere further than mcdonalds unlike u? recolour, yh i kno, but does it rlly fucking matter whether its a re colour or a model from scratch? either one ppl will have likes and dislikes, not all negative dislikes like u, seriously kid, get outside and go ask ur mom to bend over for u and ask if she feels anything and expect the obvious expected. now stfu and go crawl back to ur den plz? i dont want ur shit here just cause u spaz out over someone responding back to ur negativity.</p>
<p>hm and a shovel wow? go tie the rope and pay someone to kick your chair y dont u? fucking loser[/quote]</p>
<p>Did he just say that 4’10’’ wasn’t short…</p>
<p>Hahahaha…</p>
