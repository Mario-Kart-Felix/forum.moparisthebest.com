    <title>I found my old server files but can&#39;t connect?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-found-my-old-server-files-but-cant-connect/554224</link>
    <description>So i found my old server files from 2010 and I cant seem to get them working.

Firstly, I can&#39;t find the original client I used for the server. It was called BrokenX. So im using a clean client I found.  

Secondly, when I dont run the server I get &quot;error connecting to server&quot; but when I DO run the server I get &quot;No response to login server&quot;

If anyone can help me out that would be nice! The server download for the files are down below, test them out and see if you can get them working.
