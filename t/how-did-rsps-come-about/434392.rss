    <title>How did RSPS come about?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-did-rsps-come-about/434392</link>
    <description>This is probably a dumb question but I&#39;m going to ask it anyway.

How did people like WinterLove get Jagex&#39;s items and stuff? Like how is everything to scale and what not? Is there some way to rip off all of RuneScape&#39;s items and maps? I think it has to do with the cache but I just want to understand it fully..

Sorry if its a stupid question..  :(</description>
