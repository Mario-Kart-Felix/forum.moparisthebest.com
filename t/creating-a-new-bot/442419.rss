    <title>Creating a new bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-new-bot/442419</link>
    <description>Hey All. I&#39;m new to this form and programming in this way but i was wondering if someone could help me out. 
I want to create a hole new bot client and add scripts to just like the recent NeXus bot did through re sellers. 
I&#39;m not doing this to gain personal profic or anything i just have an interest in bots and how they work and the NeXus bot is exactly what i want to learn about. 

what programming language was the NeXus bot made with
With Jave completely?
With C++ as the client&#39;s language and Java as the scripts that tell the client what to do?
Or with this Language called NeXus ?- http://nexuslang.org/

What&#39;s Better Reflection or Injection ?


If i was to go about creating a new bot client and everything like the Nexus how would i go about it ?</description>

<p>We already have a working GL bot that works by replacing the opengl32.dll file. It interfaces with Simba: <a href="https://github.com/silabsoft/SimbaGL" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/silabsoft/SimbaGL</a></p>
<p>As for the logging, you can use GLIntercept. It works the same way (by replacing the opengl32.dll file) and you can configure it to log to a file and have pictures of each modification to a frame. I don’t know if it supports automatically associating a command with a frame, you might have to do a bit of manual work on that.</p>

              <p>Nexus uses reflection, made in Java, if you want a good look on how to make one I’d say take a look at one of the older versions, like 15.xx+; or just look at powerbot.  The only real difference was how they accessed the fields.</p>

              <p>Programming languages are just tools. That being said, different tools and toolkits are better suited to different approaches. For reflection, Java is really your only option; it’s also your best bet if you want to do bytecode injection. If you want to make an OpenGL bot you’ll probably want a toolchain that can compile to native, so C/C++ (or almost any of the Visual Studio languages if you’re on Windows) would work. For a screen scraper / color bot you can essentially use anything that has the appropriate I/O libraries.</p>
<p>Of course, you can build all the other parts that don’t interface with the game itself (e.g. the scripting system, user interfaces) in whatever language you see fit.</p>
<p>As for which approach is ‘better’, that’s your call really. All of them aim at solving the same problem. At the moment I’d probably say a OpenGL / DX bot is your best bet since it’s been three months since we’ve made any changes and the bot Silab + I worked on still works just fine. Reflection / injection bots require quite a bit of maintenance and updating due to obfuscation.</p>
