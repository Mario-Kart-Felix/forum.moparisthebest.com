    <description>have you ever thought about animals? they have fur and us humans? we have skin and shit. nothing fancy. what about skin? what&#39;s up with that? where does it start and where does it end? what if humans lost their skin every winter and walked around as skeletons and trees got pissed because they had to rake our skins off their lawn? we kill animals and wear them as our new skins. and we eat the rest of them. haha that&#39;s what they get for having fancier skin than us. being all furry. i bet i pissed a lot of vegetarians off. good. you&#39;re missing out. it tastes great.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Pwnd, post:21, topic:547234”]I sometimes try to put myself in an animal’s mind…  and the things I think of are not really explainable.  Not to me anyways.  Like, we have structured speech.  We use that when we talk ourselves through decisions.  Da fudge does a cat use?[/quote]I think it’s more about instinct and mimicry. Do you really need language to make a decision? If you’re playing a video game involving strategic, fast decision-making, do you think about how to solve it in language? These are the kinds of decisions cats and other animals make when catching prey for instance. I don’t think cats and other non-human beings can make educated long term decisions, which are usually the kind we think about with language.</p>
<p>To add, look at how some simple “survival rules” can be applied to actual mechanics in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Braitenberg vehicle</a>:</p>
<blockquote>A first agent has one light-detecting sensor that directly stimulates its single wheel, implementing the following rules:
<pre><code>More light produces faster movement.
Less light produces slower movement.
Darkness produces standstill.
</code></pre>
<p>This behavior can be interpreted as a creature that is afraid of the light and that moves fast to get away from it. Its goal is to find a dark spot to hide.</p>

<p>I remember one time when I was stoned I was very deep into my thoughts. I came to realize that my conscious state is all that I will ever know; I realized that everything about life and whatever else there might be in the universe and beyond is just locked in your conscious and unconscious mind. I thought about how a persons perspective is so much different than mine, and everything should be interpreted in different ways because in the end interpretation is infinite. I thought about how we use our eyes to see everything and how the center of every thing that exists is only in your brain and without your brain nothing exists. Your eyes are just a gate that handles information coming in to your brain so it can be processed. I even thought about how humans may be avatars of beings from another dimension, and things of that nature.</p>

<p>I always think about that. Sober or not, there’s a whole universe out there that needs exploring. It’s way too big to complete even if we lived to be a million years old. The universe is expanding every second, and there’s like billions and trillions of stars, or what if we’re being fudgeed with? What if there’s like, a giant in the sky that threatened scientists because they went too far and if the scientists said anything about the giant, he would kill everyone? Stupid thought or not, but it could be possible. All this science talk, maybe we haven’t explored deep enough. Maybe there is such thing as aliens, but they look exactly like us.</p>

<p>have you ever thought about animals? they have fur and us humans? we have skin and shit. nothing fancy. what about skin? what’s up with that? where does it start and where does it end? what if humans lost their skin every winter and walked around as skeletons and trees got pissed because they had to rake our skins off their lawn? we kill animals and wear them as our new skins. and we eat the rest of them. haha that’s what they get for having fancier skin than us. being all furry. i bet i pissed a lot of vegetarians off. good. you’re missing out. it tastes great.</p>

<p>I remember one time when I was stoned I was very deep into my thoughts. I came to realize that my conscious state is all that I will ever know; I realized that everything about life and whatever else there might be in the universe and beyond is just locked in your conscious and unconscious mind. I thought about how a persons perspective is so much different than mine, and everything should be interpreted in different ways because in the end interpretation is infinite.
