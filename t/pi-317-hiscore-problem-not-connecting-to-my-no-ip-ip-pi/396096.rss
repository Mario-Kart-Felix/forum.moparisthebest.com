    <description>[b]Welcome, I&#39;m having a slight problem with the IP,[/b]

1) I have add port 80-80 to my router website thing so that&#39;s portfoward and i named it hiscores.
2) I went to my firewall and added hiscores to TCP and UDP port 80 and named it hiscores aswell.
3) I went to my c: drive and went into my xampp folder and then htdocs then hiscores 
and i have changed all the ip&#39;s in all the files to legacypro.no-ip.biz (my ip) and left the myconnection bit in mysql.php to &#39;Localhost&#39;
Then i try going to my hiscores (http://legacypro.no-ip.biz/highscores/highscores.php) on the internet and it doesnt load. The only time it loads when i use: http://127.0.0.1/highscores/highscores.php

              <p>I had exact same problem. My problem was that my isp didn’t allow port 80 to be used. So all I did was go to Xampp folder, than Apache, than i went to conf, opened up httpd.conf with notepad ++ doesn’t matter what you use.</p>
<p>searched for 80, changed them to 60. restarted apache, forwarded to port 60. bham worked fine.</p>
<p>I added you on msn, so if you need help feel free to give a shout their. I can also do TM.</p>
