    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/43594-port-help-connection-refused-please-help-rspstutorials/519799</link>
    <description>OK so I am going to use the best English I can here so here i go, OK to start of I would just like to say my operating system is Windows XP. Every time i port foward and check port 43594 it says the following: Error: I could not see your service on xxx.xx.x.xxx on port (43594) Reason: Connection refused. Now connection refused means that something is blocking the port but its opened. I have already disabled my firewall added and added the exception in the windows firewall plus made a 43594 inbound and outbound service and also a firewall service on my default gateway although it is still is not working and I would just like to ask some one or some body to help and guide me through this lots of thanks - RSPSTutorials</description>
