        <p>Ok, so, I‚Äôve been meaning to post this for a while now but I never got around to it, and I know 6 hasn‚Äôt been released yet but there‚Äôs a reason I‚Äôve included it.</p>
<p>For anyone about to post tl;dr, this is mainly for cod fanboys, most of the points listed are pretty obvious and I‚Äôd only expect someone with as much free time as me to actually read, and reply, such as tico.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Hint: just scroll down to the bold bits for a summary.</p>
<p>Well, cod4, I wasn‚Äôt going to buy it but I was told this game was the dogs bollocks, endless reviews praised it and even Yahtzee from Zero Punctuation said it was a good game, so I decided to buy it. After all, I had heard it ‚Äúrevolutionized‚Äù the FPS genre. Single player wasn‚Äôt that good, and gameplay was worse. I mean, this is about cod and I know that, but almost instant deaths from shots are NOT realistic, and in games make them almost unplayable. Take for example, death by limb shots. Sure, it‚Äôd be painful as heal and you probably would die of shock, bloodloss or whatever but it wouldn‚Äôt kill you as quick as a headshot, and I know this is a reoccurring problem in FPS games but it‚Äôs easily fixed, but anyway, on to multiplayer. As I‚Äôm sure many of you may remember, multiplayer was full of faggots using lmgs, actually first, I‚Äôll discuss a few problems with cod4 specifically first.</p>
<p>Lets talk about lag. When I first got cod4 I had a 2mbit package and only in the last week have I been able to experience 20mbit speeds in games, and I‚Äôll explain more later, but on 2mbit I could play fine with not too many deaths due to me experiencing lag, to give you a comparison, say in Quake 4 or KZ2, if you lag, the enemeis stop, you stop, and you die because you‚Äôre a sitting duck. In cod4 however(and 5), you can run, shoot and kill enemies while you‚Äôre not synced with everyone else, and for the most part get away with lagging, I‚Äôve probably done it a lot of times, and it‚Äôs happened to me more times than I can count to, well, not really but it‚Äôs a big reason as to why I get a lot of extra kills and deaths. Another thing that is probably related to lag is hitboxes, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen some css vids where the hitboxes are 2-3 ft in front of where they should be, and while cod4 isn‚Äôt as bad as this, in a lot of the replays someone seems to be aiming say, towards my groin and get headshots(more on this in a bit) due to some fuckery with height levels.</p>
<p>Another problem with cod4 is bullet penetration, this was a big selling point and while it <span class="bbcode-s">works as expected</span> is an interesting feature, it‚Äôs funny how handgun bullets can penetrate several layers of brick walls and still kill. This, along with deep impact means the maps may as well be in an empty room without cover, which is basically what killhouse is. I can‚Äôt really put much more here, bullets eat through everything as if they were made of steel, and while armour piercing rounds are made of hardened steel, it doesn‚Äôt make much of a difference if you use deep impact or not, which suggests all rounds are armour piercing.</p>
<p>Another thing terribly wrong in cod4 and 5 is firing from the hip, maybe I‚Äôm just a console tard but honestly, I‚Äôm just as good with a joystick while sniping in cod than I am with a mouse, I don‚Äôt see why aiming has to be dummed down to the point where if they‚Äôre in front of you, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you actually aim on them or not, they still die if you shoot them first. I remember the days where high powered guns shot to the direct center of the screen, in cod4 and 5 they just slap a wide crosshair on all sniper rifles which really, REALLY won‚Äôt hit anyone at close distance, even if you crouch. I mean, ok, supposedly there are ways of no-scoping perfectly but I‚Äôve tried and I tried hard, but the only kills I‚Äôve got while no-scoping were pure fluke where I didn‚Äôt try the techniques I found on youtube.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionlessae52.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Finally that brings me to LMGs, balancing in cod4 is terrible. Lets take the MP5, it‚Äôs accurate, useful at medium to long distance, nice fire rate, and kills very effectively, just like the m4. P90 does well, it does very well in fact and I‚Äôd rather have it over any assault rifle in any situation. The rest of the smgs and assault rifles are a joke and usually have reduced damage in return for stats that won‚Äôt help, such as range. Sniper rifles are next, and while the M40A3, Dragonuv(at a pinch) and the 50cal all act as sniper rifles should, the m21 often takes 2 shots to kill, and the r700 is a joke, 1 less bullet than M40A3 and for what? I can‚Äôt really comment on shotguns as they work perfectly, which brings me to LMGs. They can kill anything through anything faster than you can aim and shoot, they‚Äôre easy to use, come with HUUUUUUUGE clips and while the reloading times are slow to make up for it, you can use sleight of hand(stopping power isn‚Äôt that useful with LMGs), and finding a place to reload and even change your knickers isn‚Äôt THAT hard. Lets recap, most smgs are a little worse than assault rifles, the mp5 may as well be an assault rifle, and the p90 is the best of them. The sniper rifles are ok, but there‚Äôs really no reason to use M21 and R700, and the other 3 are almost identical, shotguns are fine and LMGs act like all of these, with more ammo.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So, why is cod4 a bad game?</span> It‚Äôs very generic, it was hyped up, there‚Äôs some bad gameplay issues that need fixing(for example, bullet penetration), guns need balancing, martyrdom is as stupid as it is annoying, grenades ‚Äúcook‚Äù too long, there‚Äôs a lot of network issues, did I mention it was hyped?</p>
<p>Now, cod5, I like cod5, mostly. For those who don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs basically cod4 if it were reskinned. I‚Äôll try to keep treyarch bashing at a minimum but it‚Äôs hard to resist.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll start with lag same as last time. The first few hours I played of cod5 online I was surprised, I could actually play a game instead of spending 10 minutes joining a game for the host to fucking quit and games to fucking freeze, I can probably count the times games have ended due to host on both hands instead of needing a calculator for cod4. Generally the network code has improved dramatically, you can notice a difference. They seem to have borked something along the way though, maybe this was like it in cod4 but I haven‚Äôt played it in a long time. Take a scenario, I have a double barrel shotgun, it‚Äôs instant kill within a few feet and only takes 2 shots at 10 ft or so, I hide around a corner. Someone comes around the corner facing me(read: not shooting, not about to shoot), I go to shoot but nope, I‚Äôve already died. It took me a REALLY long time to figure out why this is happening, clients don‚Äôt sync properly(and it isn‚Äôt a ping issue, it has happened every game where I have a free 20mbit download speed available) so if you‚Äôre an unlucky bastard who‚Äôs not up to speed with everyone else, there isn‚Äôt anything you can do other than hope your shots killed him and hope some more that no one‚Äôs around that corner because by the time you see them you‚Äôll be dead, which brings me to my next argument.</p>
<p>Weapons in cod5 are seriously a joke. The stg is basically the only good rifle. The others just don‚Äôt have a big enough clip to damage ratio, and compared to say, PISTOLS, just don‚Äôt work. Now, since machine guns were a huge problem in cod4, you‚Äôd expect them to be nerfed in cod5 right? Well, if you said yes, go treat yourself to a cookie because they were, mostly. There are a lot of them, each having it‚Äôs own strong and weak points, sort of. The biggest advantage is the ability to well, mount them using a bipod that you unlock, this gives dramatically reduced recoil and make machine guns a reliable option for medium to long range shooting that‚Äôs better than anything other than bolt action rifles. Now, the problem is, instead of fucking trying to fix the glitch with bipods in prone, treyarch just removed it. Nice‚Ä¶  Bolt action rifles are okay I guess, can‚Äôt complain about shotguns, and smgs, well, they‚Äôre enough to make me trade the game in when I can be assed. Lets just say, smgs are cod4‚Äôs lmgs, they have the least recoil of any automatic gun, they have ridiculous power, more than their real life equivalents, better range and penetration and all. Lets take the mp40, 2 shots to kill with stopping power, 3 or 4 without. If you have juggernaut it‚Äôll buy you: no extra time. The mp40 has less recoil than any gun in the game, and compared to the mp40 in cod2, it is an absolute joke. I honestly think treyarch employees just knocked off for lunch during balance testing and couldn‚Äôt be assed to finish it. I mean, any noob can use the mp40 and they do, every single game I‚Äôve played on cod5 has had some faggot using an mp40. I just got off a game on cod5(as I‚Äôm playing it between paragraphs) and every single time I died the enemy was using an mp40. I mean, the crosshair is pathetic on it(as it is with all smgs), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjHFgTMyjlM" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">watch this video</a>, you can see the recoil he gets after 2-3 shots, yet you can get (mostly) perfect kills firing it in full auto like <a href="http://www.9thsspanzer.com/Images/PhotoGallery/Events/2007/Mifflin-April/MP40.jpg" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>. If you fired the magnum or a rifle from the hip you just committed suicide, so why should smgs be different?</p>
<p>Finally there are the glitches, for every one treyarch fixes some retard adds another, it wasn‚Äôt bad but jesus christ, it seems they just can‚Äôt fix these things. I really can‚Äôt comment but it has to be mentioned.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So, why do I think cod5 is a bad game?</span> Well, I was hoping it would fix some of the problems cod4 had, but in the end for what it fixed it added, heavily. You can just refer to the cod4 list as that‚Äôs adequate, but I honestly think mp40 and smgs need to be added, the guns need balancing but these are just unbelievable. As I‚Äôve been playing recently(with 20mbit speeds, should have a decent ping) I still get killed quicker by an mp40 faster than I can shoot with a shotgun, and it‚Äôs not the shotgun that‚Äôs the problem. In the last few games I‚Äôve noticed, either my shotgun has bad taste in who it wants to kill or the game is fucked, at 5ft I ‚Äúhit‚Äù with both shots but it won‚Äôt kill them, I get sprayed with an mp40 and die faster than I can think of what I can do to not die. What‚Äôs surprising is I get kills at 8-9 ft without needing to fire again, in the same games!</p>
<p>So, it‚Äôs been around 2 hours since I started this post so I‚Äôll try to make the next bit quick: why I think cod6 will be bad.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll start with camoflauge, this is a huge problem in cod4 or 5, you go in prone, move the crosshair a tiny bit to the left or right and your body swings 180 degrees with your legs sticking out wearing green neon lights saying ‚Äúhis head is here‚Äù, ready for a sniper to shoot. This happens regularly standing up, in crouch(which I should add, moving in crouch ‚Äúraises‚Äù you but it doesn‚Äôt raise your view angle so you have no way to tell if the enemy can actually see you, many times I‚Äôve been killed because my back is actually visible to them when to me it looks like it‚Äôs 1 ft below the cover I‚Äôm hiding behind). Next I think they‚Äôll break weapon balancing again. I won‚Äôt be buying the game unless some highly biased fuck convinces me it‚Äôs good(yes, I mean you thug) so I won‚Äôt be around to tell, but I guarantee they‚Äôll fuck something up bad enough to make everyone and their dog abuse it. I also imagine there will be more network code bugs, but hopefully no glitches(considering cod4 was fine the most part). If martyrdom isn‚Äôt removed or modified in, you know, a more humanly possible way then the multiplayer mode will definitely ruined, and generally the rest of the perks need balancing(and not by treyarch‚Äôs staff who think like: ‚Äúwe‚Äôll stick stopping power at a low level, add a powerful gun at low level and everyone else can go fuck themselves‚Äù). Next I think they‚Äôll ignore weapon penetration, I like the idea of lead bullets actually disintegrating on hard surfaces while bullet penetration adds(or is removed completely, while armour piercing ammunition is added as a weapon addon) armour piercing ammunition which work like before. I think if a lot of this stuff is fixed it‚Äôll deserve the hype it‚Äôs had, but I guess only time will tell.</p>
<p>So guys, thanks for reading, I‚Äôm sure you had more fun reading this than I had playing cod 10 minutes, I‚Äôll look forward to some replies.</p>

        <p>I still think that first Doom and then Goldeneye revolutionised the FPS. The COD franchise is just these games but with fancy graphics and supposedly superior complexity.</p>
<p>My only criticism of your review is how detailed and specific you are about things that ‚Äúmost‚Äù average gamers do not notice. It obviously bothers you a lot and I do agree with most of your points.</p>

        <p><span class="bbcode-b">COD4:</span> It seems you want a game to be <span class="bbcode-b">truly</span> realistic. If you want that, go join the army. Shot multiple times in the limb will kill you in COD4 because if they were to realistically implement things where if I were to shoot you in the leg a few dozen times and you just lie there for another 2 minutes until someone kills you, it wouldn‚Äôt be that fun. Although <span class="bbcode-u">last stand</span> does a pretty good job if you‚Äôre looking for something like that.</p>
<p>The lag problems are because the games are not hosted on a server, they‚Äôre hosted by players. This problem which I believe is in COD5 as well so I won‚Äôt mention it down the road either, though, I‚Äôm sure MW2 (assuming you‚Äôre talking about MW2 and not TreyArch‚Äôs COD6) will be throwing that out the door‚Ä¶ hopefully as Infinity Ward are planning on making this a MLG game. (This lag problem occurs in GOW/2 as well I believe, it‚Äôs called lag switching)</p>
<p>You are right with bullet penetration, especially on a map like <span class="bbcode-u">Backlot</span> where if someone is sitting on top of that mounted machine gun it‚Äôs pretty much insta-kill even if you‚Äôre hidding behind a couple walls.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre just talking about Snipers here? So‚Ä¶ yeah, the no-scoping glitches are real and work. I‚Äôve tested them out myself but I don‚Äôt use them.</p>
<p>The MP5 is definitely not that useful at long distances, it‚Äôs really hard to pick someone off with an MP5 at a long range and will likely end in you dying for taking the small while to shoot. I‚Äôm surprised you haven‚Äôt mentioned the M16 in all this, since if you are to hit someone with this gun‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre dead. There‚Äôs only a few milliseconds to make up for the time they made a mistake in shooting, to directly hit you the next time.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre right though, you can‚Äôt be bad with an LMG. You can literally stand there and spray and get a good amount of kills. But, in my opinion‚Ä¶ most of the guns are fine as they are. Of course some need balancing, but perfection isn‚Äôt key when it comes to this. You need to modify things to adjust to how you want your game to be played. For example, the M16 in real life is not a semi-automatic gun, it‚Äôs automatic.</p>
<p>A game can certainly not be bad because it was overhyped. I hear about many games being hyped up so much it‚Äôs all I think about for that day. Then‚Ä¶ critics come and say the game is bad because is was hyped up too much. Hyping up is what get people into the game and attracts more to play. Now I know what you mean by someone saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs THE BEST GAME EVAR PMFGZ LOLZ‚Äù‚Ä¶ but c‚Äômon, I hear about almost every game being overhyped.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">COD5:</span> I‚Äôve never had that problem you‚Äôve encountered with your shotgun so I can‚Äôt really say anyhing on that‚Ä¶ To restate, the MP40 was obviously modified to suit the games needs. If you look and compare, not all of the guns act as how they do in real life. (Going back to the Dragunov in COD4, the recoil on that thing in real life is devastating and you simply can not have that in a game) Now, I don‚Äôt know how‚Ä¶ but I am RETARDEDLY good in COD5. For some reason it seems you need A LOT more skill to play COD4 than COD5. I use the MP40 but I definitely don‚Äôt use it how you see others do, as with the MP5 in COD4. I play tactical and actually use that little LB button resting under my left finger. I <span class="bbcode-b">NEVER</span> see the need to spray at the hip and always find time to aim and shoot instead, spraying at the hip is just not how I play and I think it makes me play a lot better than I would otherwise.</p>
<p>Now I mainly use the MP40 and MP5, but I am skilled with the shotguns and other guns in those games as well‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just what I perfer. The trench gun in COD5, I can maneuver around people spraying that shit everywhere and still manage to kill them. It‚Äôs how you play in most cases.</p>
<p>Now I‚Äôm assuming cover, among other things will be fixed in MW2. I‚Äôve heard about it being complained about for ages‚Ä¶ But for some reason I RARELY see these cases happen for me when I go to kill someone.</p>

<p>Yeah I‚Äôve tried last stand, probably more than any other perk on 4. It‚Äôs ridiculous the amount of times it doesn‚Äôt take effect, and compared to say, martyrdom it is completely underpowered. I like 5 because other people with second chance could revive you, but relying on teammates to help you in <span class="bbcode-u">a team game</span> is harder than you think. The point I should have made was, if you‚Äôre going to give someone the ability to go into last stand/second chance, it should be free, and on 5, morphine should be given as a perk to say, revive you with reduced speed and dramatically reduced walking speed.</p>

<p>Again I should have said, I‚Äôd prefer it if there was no crosshair and if say, the bullets fired reasonably close to the middle of the screen.

<p>I‚Äôve never really had a problem with the M16, probably because of lag I don‚Äôt know but every gun seems to kill me that fast. I haven‚Äôt played cod4 in a while but all I can think of is a time where someone with an M16 was spraying me while I was jumping about to reload, he eventually missed 28~ times and had to reload, I ran over and stabbed him.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>I realize guns would have to be modified to make a playable game, but cod5‚Äôs guns seem godly. I didn‚Äôt want to get too much into realism with cod5 because I was getting tired, but treyarch was trying to copy cod4‚Äôs success imo, the ‚Äúred dot‚Äù simply wouldn‚Äôt work the way it does in cod4 and was probably only added to please the red dot users, and the guns generally seem much better than in cod2.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have much of a problem if the user bothers to aim, but from shotgun killing distance, the mp40 is much better from the hip and it can kill people further away than 15~ ft, the only advantage the shotgun has is it‚Äôs instant kill where with the mp40 you have to wait for the 3rd shot(which vs anything other than shotguns will come faster).</p>

<p>Hopefully it is, it‚Äôs kind of unfair for me to use cod5 as an example, but firing through wood shouldn‚Äôt be less effective than firing through brick walls, and things that acually look like good cover(cars, crates, walls) should act like cover instead of exploding(if it‚Äôs cars) and not stopping bullets(if it‚Äôs crates and walls).

<p>As a fairly casual FPS gamer, CoD4 is one of my favourite games. I cba to analyse it in this much depth simply because I don‚Äôt play it enough.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I‚Äôve played it a lot so I can‚Äôt quite reply fairly but for cod5, most of the things I listed I had happen to me in 3-4 games. I just wished cod5 was nerfed in patch, even if that means less kills all around.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd thought I‚Äôd elaborate on the lag a bit, on cod5 it seems I shoot, 4-5 magnum shots later and none of them hit, I‚Äôm not a bad shot and regularly use up all my magnum ammo, but it seems on a certain one or two guys I just can‚Äôt hit them, I mean, everyone‚Äôs at 3 bars ping so either we‚Äôre all getting 100ms + of lag and the game treats it as as green because everyone has it, or the clients just don‚Äôt sync up properly. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all died once or twice by a knife 3 ft away, or go to fire a missile for it to disappear midflight, or even shot someone and in the replay it hits 2 ft to the side of them!</p>
