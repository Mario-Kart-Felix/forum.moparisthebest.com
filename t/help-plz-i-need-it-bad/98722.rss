    <title>Help plz i need it bad</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-plz-i-need-it-bad/98722</link>
    <description>Ok, I downloaded &quot;death scape&quot; source off of Xbox Modder&#39;s list. When I go to extract     the files, a thing comes up saying the file is password protected. What do I do? Is there a way around the password? And most of the files I can not open without a certain program(theres at least 50) and they all take separate programs, is there a way I can get through that with out downloading 50 different programs?</description>
