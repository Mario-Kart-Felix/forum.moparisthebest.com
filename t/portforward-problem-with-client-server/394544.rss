    <title>Portforward problem with client/server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portforward-problem-with-client-server/394544</link>
    <description>I didn&#39;t know where to put this... So if staff could move this too the proper area please do so :). 


Theres a problem with my fortforwarding or no-ip is not working or something...


When I try to get on my server using the no-ip.org ip it doesn&#39;t log me in. I have everything right. And it still doesn&#39;t work.

My portforward is right. My paths and classpaths are right (I believe) and my no-ip is up. And the ip is right in the client thats on the thing. The host is up too. It has a check and everything..

Any ideas on how to fix it, so I can put it online?


Edit: 


How do I change ip in a [PI] client... No gui or anything so is it the class68_sub15 or whatever?</description>

<p>Yea I think you have to open ports with no-ip. And can’t your portforward with utorrent?</p>
