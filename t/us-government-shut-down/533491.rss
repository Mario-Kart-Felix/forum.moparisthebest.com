<p>They’re not against the idea of NHS, they’re against Obamacare specifically because of how it works. If we’re going to have NHS then they want it done properly. Democrats in the US are known for aiming for short-term goals, where Republicans tend to look at the long term risks. This makes Democrats seem more progressive even though both parties are aiming for the same thing in the end.</p>

              <p>Saw this comment:</p>
<p>“The Republicans only want (latest compromise offer)for the Obamacare to be equal for all and be NO exemptions for Obama and his family, or Congress and their family, Federal judges or big businesses. But no, they want to be exempt because who in the hell can afford 9.5% of their income to pay for it. If the President makes $450,000 a year his health care would be $42,750 a year under his own stupid plan. He should have to pay it if we have to pay it. Fair is fair!!! Thank a Republican for fighting for equality!”</p>
<p>I haven’t really been following this whole deal but if the above is true then it makes sense that Obama would put the majority of the stress on the middle class</p>
<p>Even though RiiPiinFtW sees this as the republicans just hating it for no reason, there are alot of hidden clauses in the bill. They’ve been on the headlines a few times over the past few years. The general right-wing consensus is NHS is good but Obama is trying to push it through too fast because this is the only thing he’ll be known for. Republicans are mad because Obama hasn’t considered the risks his brute-force approach to switching to the new system may cause.</p>
<p>with that said holding it hostage to a shut down is stupid</p>

[/quote]<br>
if you havent realized both parties are retarded I feel bad for u son[/quote]Oh I have noticed both parties being children, but the Republicans are the ones to blame. They talk about how they were put in there to do this, when in reality, democrats had the most votes in the 2012 election, but the republicans won the districts.</p>
<p>Its all a back and fourth game, but the democrats won’t step down. They have grown some balls.</p>
