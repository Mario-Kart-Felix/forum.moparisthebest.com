        <p>Why are you so bent on ruining RSChill? Do you honestly think it is going to help your server any? Typical sob story would be “Well if everyone joins RSChill nobody will join us and we have nobody to pk!” Well did it ever occur to you that if you did not DoS and hack other servers you would not gain the bad rep to repel incoming traffic? Did it also occur to you that your server lacks the attraction to bring more players? We did not have to do anything on any other server to get our traffic and you are so stricken with envy you do not realize that by attacking our server you are not only gaining a bad rep but are wasting time you could be using to PROPERLY bring in more players! You would succeed alot better if you actually bothered spreading the word in a friendly manner but what do you do instead? DoS other servers just to try to ruin that server and make its players go to OTHER servers instead of yours? Hack accounts and actually bother STEALING 8 gems from a stall with a spawn time of a couple minutes just to get ahead? You guys made a server for pking and you come take high level accounts and SKILL with it? You guys need to get your priorities straight before you ruin your server entirely, which as I have been told is at least a year old and STILL in its current sorry condition.</p>
<p>My friendly advice to DGB: Stop attacking other servers and try attracting traffic properly, which does not include spamming other servers’ globals. This will make your server far more successful than your current antics.</p>

<p>Honestly, no one cares. You should have known you would get attacks, almost every RSC Server does. If you can’t get protection against it and are just going to complain about it on the Moparscape forums just shut it off. Also there is nothing unique in either one of your servers.</p>

<p>That’s the problem: too many don’t care about something that is more harmful than helpful. A simple protection is not a constructive answer. The point of this thread is to put an end to an illegal act on other people in an attempt to make the victims join their server. The sad part is more people like you for example accuse those like me trying to see an end to it that we are just crying over spilled milk or simply trolling the DoSers. I admit most do troll them out of anger and frustration but it is not the true answer. So many people play these servers out of rage that they have forgotten what playing a game is all about… I only wish people can remember this reason and enjoy themselves no matter what server they are on even if it isn’t theirs. There is no contest here people we all share a common factor: We want to play Runescape Classic, be it for PKing or “skilling”. The other fact of the matter is so many pure pk servers like dgbpk for instance fail because they focus too much on pking and not enough on skilling. Think about it: How much of the pking community enjoy it more when there is VALUABLY RARE stuff instead of FREEBIES at stake? This applies more to dueling than anything. If all is too easy it becomes boring and people leave.</p>
<p>Think DGB players as well as all you out there who want to reply to this thread like cyndibal did: Is the server you are on taking PROPER steps to expand? Is DoSing REALLY the solution? Can the server improve to attract more players? Logic bests rage my friends!</p>

<p>No, I didn’t and I don’t need to. I have an idea of what it says and, like I said, you aren’t going to change a thing making posts like this, complaining about the situation. You are clearly clueless of how pointless this thread is, and how it will only encourage more malicious behavior. You aren’t going to get through to these people by reasoning and/or guilt. If you like the game as much, put up some money and buy some protection.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s clear that you haven’t read anything that I’ve said. I hope you get it this time for your own sake.[/quote]</p>

<p>You honestly think words like those will help your server? Listen to what I am trying to tell you, for your sake. If you continue this war path there is only one conclusion: Everyone leaves all private servers and goes to moparclassic once it releases from alpha. Why moparclassic? Because it will have protection from DoS attacks. Now do you see how futile your attacks are?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/joe777-2.html">@Joe777</a>: I’m going to attempt to get you to realize complaining about it isn’t going to make it stop, it’ll actually encouraging it believe it or not. You’re not going to stop someone from doing something malicious just because you complain about it. That is exactly why these people do what they do - they want reactions. You’re feeding into what they are fishing for.</p>
<p>I’m not saying ‘DGB’ players have done anything, I would have no way of knowing, and I don’t believe you have any hard evidence to support your accusations either. If you do, please share it, otherwise just let it go. Please don’t respond back with “well something happened and the next minute we were attacked”: that is not proof.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You didn’t read a word I posted did you? This is not a complaint thread it is an attempt to get them to see the light in a sense. And as long as you think that way sure nothing is going to change. The more people that can pitch in to this cause the greater the chances of getting it to stop. I am not saying it is a guarantee but it is worth a shot isn’t it?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, I didn’t and I don’t need to. I have an idea of what it says and, like I said, you aren’t going to change a thing making posts like this, complaining about the situation. You are clearly clueless of how pointless this thread is, and how it will only encourage more malicious behavior. You aren’t going to get through to these people by reasoning and/or guilt. If you like the game as much, put up some money and buy some protection.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s clear that you haven’t read anything that I’ve said. I hope you get it this time for your own sake.</p>

<p>If you aren’t going to bother reading anything don’t bother posting it is as simple as that.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If only it was that simple. If you had read anything, and you’re still trying to progress with this topic not knowing you’re being an idiot about the whole situation.<br>
Only to get you to shut up about the ‘not reading’ crap, I took a look at your post. I don’t understand how you don’t think you’re complaining, or how you don’t think my argument fits. I was spot on without even having to read your post (believe it or not, you’re not the only one who has made a topic like this. There has literally been thousands…)</p>
<p>You just said to ‘verse905’: “You honestly think words like those will help your server?”</p>
<p>What makes you think <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> words will help <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> server?</p>
<p>You’re still making random accusations without showing any hard evidence and honestly I find that very distasteful. Also at your comment about players going to ‘moparclassic’ because they have enough sense to have protection against these attacks: Why don’t <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> have enough sense to buy protection?</p>
<p>So your plan is to beg and plead for the attacks to stop, so you don’t lose your players to another server that is competent enough to protect themselves against attacks?</p>
<p>I’m done here. It’s in your best interest to listen. Otherwise you should join those other players and start playing ‘moparclassic’.[/quote]</p>
<p>You see this topic as a complaint because you compare it to those who tried out of anger and frustration and you are not trying to be very open about it. I am doing this for their sake, not mine or anyone else’s. Until you can learn to differentiate between complaining and reasoning you were not “spot on”.</p>
<p>FYI the owner is getting a dedicated server so you don’t have to worry about the server anymore. With nothing on the line except DGBPK’s reputation you cannot necessarily call it a complaint can you? This is why I am posting all this: to try to HELP these people, even though they are no longer directly DoSing but using a program to do it for them.</p>
<p>As for the “random accusations” these are not accusations and verse905 is backing it up or framing DGBPK entirely.</p>
<p>There is no begging and pleading involved. I show the lost the way into the light then it is up to them to take the path or not. Hopefully they do, for their sake… I would hate to be them if they ever got busted for this upon the feds and ISPs actually cracking down together!</p>
<p>I will be looking at it when it is done to see how it is but for the time being my interest is turned elsewhere.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you wish to go over? If not then thank you for your time and have a nice day!</p>
