    <description>Why are you so bent on ruining RSChill? Do you honestly think it is going to help your server any? Typical sob story would be &quot;Well if everyone joins RSChill nobody will join us and we have nobody to pk!&quot; Well did it ever occur to you that if you did not DoS and hack other servers you would not gain the bad rep to repel incoming traffic? Did it also occur to you that your server lacks the attraction to bring more players? We did not have to do anything on any other server to get our traffic and you are so stricken with envy you do not realize that by attacking our server you are not only gaining a bad rep but are wasting time you could be using to PROPERLY bring in more players! You would succeed alot better if you actually bothered spreading the word in a friendly manner but what do you do instead? DoS other servers just to try to ruin that server and make its players go to OTHER servers instead of yours? Hack accounts and actually bother STEALING 8 gems from a stall with a spawn time of a couple minutes just to get ahead? You guys made a server for pking and you come take high level accounts and SKILL with it? You guys need to get your priorities straight before you ruin your server entirely, which as I have been told is at least a year old and STILL in its current sorry condition.

My friendly advice to DGB: Stop attacking other servers and try attracting traffic properly, which does not include spamming other servers&#39; globals. This will make your server far more successful than your current antics.</description>

Look, I’m sick of all this grade-school drama when it comes to the RSC section.  This is what it comes down to, if you are so childish you would attack (Ddos) anyone else, then I will ban you and delete all of your topics, and censor the URL to your server on this forum.  For now, I have proof that ‘rschill.eu’ are attacking another server, right here on their own website:</p>

<p>I’m going to give ‘pkufast’ 24 hours from this post to stop the attack, and if not then I’ll do what I said earlier.</p>

<p>Finally now can i provide you proof of what RSCEmulation has been doing for over 2 years? I have MSN Logs on my HDD.</p>

<p>Well I don’t exactly agree to them sucking but I agree to the rest of what you said. In all honesty a server is only as good as its community. The downside though is not one of these servers will likely ever be like Jagex’s were but it would be nice if one was lol because let’s face it Jagex’s server sucks because JAGEX runs it.</p>

<p>Of course it isn’t new but it also shouldn’t be old either… It is no different than trying to blow up a building which of course is illegal. If they continue illegal activities ONLINE who’s to say they won’t try it OFFLINE too? But I digress. I have shown them a path with light at the end and it is their option to choose it and lead a better life or continue their current path and waste their time ruining their lives.</p>

<p>If you aren’t going to bother reading anything don’t bother posting it is as simple as that.<br>

<p>If only it was that simple. If you had read anything, and you’re still trying to progress with this topic not knowing you’re being an idiot about the whole situation.<br>
Only to get you to shut up about the ‘not reading’ crap, I took a look at your post. I don’t understand how you don’t think you’re complaining, or how you don’t think my argument fits. I was spot on without even having to read your post (believe it or not, you’re not the only one who has made a topic like this. There has literally been thousands…)</p>
<p>You just said to ‘verse905’: “You honestly think words like those will help your server?”</p>
<p>What makes you think <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> words will help <span class="bbcode-b">your</span> server?</p>
<p>You’re still making random accusations without showing any hard evidence and honestly I find that very distasteful. Also at your comment about players going to ‘moparclassic’ because they have enough sense to have protection against these attacks: Why don’t <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> have enough sense to buy protection?</p>
<p>So your plan is to beg and plead for the attacks to stop, so you don’t lose your players to another server that is competent enough to protect themselves against attacks?</p>
<p>I’m done here. It’s in your best interest to listen. Otherwise you should join those other players and start playing ‘moparclassic’.[/quote]</p>
<p>You see this topic as a complaint because you compare it to those who tried out of anger and frustration and you are not trying to be very open about it. I am doing this for their sake, not mine or anyone else’s. Until you can learn to differentiate between complaining and reasoning you were not “spot on”.</p>
<p>FYI the owner is getting a dedicated server so you don’t have to worry about the server anymore. With nothing on the line except DGBPK’s reputation you cannot necessarily call it a complaint can you? This is why I am posting all this: to try to HELP these people, even though they are no longer directly DoSing but using a program to do it for them.</p>
<p>As for the “random accusations” these are not accusations and verse905 is backing it up or framing DGBPK entirely.</p>
<p>There is no begging and pleading involved. I show the lost the way into the light then it is up to them to take the path or not. Hopefully they do, for their sake… I would hate to be them if they ever got busted for this upon the feds and ISPs actually cracking down together!</p>
<p>I will be looking at it when it is done to see how it is but for the time being my interest is turned elsewhere.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you wish to go over? If not then thank you for your time and have a nice day!</p>

<p>You honestly think words like those will help your server? Listen to what I am trying to tell you, for your sake. If you continue this war path there is only one conclusion: Everyone leaves all private servers and goes to moparclassic once it releases from alpha. Why moparclassic? Because it will have protection from DoS attacks. Now do you see how futile your attacks are?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Outspoken, post:2, topic:430019”]<a class="mention" href="/u/joe777">@Joe777</a>: I’m going to attempt to get you to realize complaining about it isn’t going to make it stop, it’ll actually encouraging it believe it or not. You’re not going to stop someone from doing something malicious just because you complain about it. That is exactly why these people do what they do - they want reactions. You’re feeding into what they are fishing for.</p>
<p>I’m not saying ‘DGB’ players have done anything, I would have no way of knowing, and I don’t believe you have any hard evidence to support your accusations either. If you do, please share it, otherwise just let it go. Please don’t respond back with “well something happened and the next minute we were attacked”: that is not proof.[/quote]</p>
<p>You didn’t read a word I posted did you? This is not a complaint thread it is an attempt to get them to see the light in a sense. And as long as you think that way sure nothing is going to change. The more people that can pitch in to this cause the greater the chances of getting it to stop. I am not saying it is a guarantee but it is worth a shot isn’t it?</p>
