<p>I’m not looking for people who are advanced in client hacking but rather people who are willing to learn and show promise to be good team members who have fun. If you are interested then apply! I’m not going to say no because I don’t like you. I’m sure we can talk it out and then if there are any gaps I think that we can cross then we will get there when we get there.</p>
<p>I agree. Some of what we do is original and I don’t care if our ideas are released because I doubt anyone will copy them. Like I said we are people for the community and all our projects are community oriented. So I hope that helps dispel any confusion/worries.</p>
<p>Understanding the components and pieces of the client can come with me giving you a little lecture about what I know. Most of the ‘client hacking’ I see around here is as you said more practical application when we work with the understanding and inferring bit. So that’s something to be aware of. But its not difficult to learn. Like I said, I can help with that.</p>
