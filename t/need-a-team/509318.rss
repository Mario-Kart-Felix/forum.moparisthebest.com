    <description>[size=24pt]Welcome to redemptionscape![/size]
Hello, i am currently hosting a server [317] with a guy who is a bad coder and has no respect. I have this server online for proof i can host i&#39;m not a coder i know the basics but the rest confuses me. So some stuff about me i am currently 17 jr in highschool next year i failed a grade before thats why im going to be a jr, i have a amazing girlfriend we are 9months apart and been dating for about a year and a half every saturday we hang out but i can leave the server on. Im about to start my bank account to be able to buy vps soon. and now ill tell you some goals for the server
[size=18pt]GOALS[/size]
Alright so here are the basic goals :
to have a server i can call &quot;its our work&quot; basically not just leech.
to make a server none has seen before to work hard and have it pay off.
to make it fun to play and make so theres something players can always do.
so those are basic goals atm. now for what im looking for all together.
[size=18pt]What i need for this server.[/size]
So what i need is:
A good coder with atleast a year of coding and knows whats hes doing.
I need a web designer to design our website.

<p>I Find myself quoting Clawz multiple times today, haha. But seriously he’s right, have a more complex process of finding your staff, you could end up with a coder just like the first.</p>
