    <title>Need a Team! =)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-team/336353</link>
    <description>Well I am a educated Java coder, and I&#39;m looking for some players who think they are good enough to Join my Project RuneLord wich is currently Beta.

~What Kind of Staff Members do I need??~
Well, I am currently looking for some experienced [u]Modelers[/u] because previously i tried to make models of some items and faithfuly failed...
If you think your a good modeler add me on MSN xxlove2pkxx@hotmail.com
and answer these questions:
What have you previously Modeled, Items, Npc&#39;s or New Areas?
How old are you? (Optional)
If you would like to be a Website Java Coder answer these questions:
What do you think of our Java-coded Runescape-like website (I&#39;ll pm it to you just pm me for link)
How old are you? (Optional)
If you want to be a RuneLord Coder, you must be these:
- A good server owner, greet new players etc.
- Nice to work with never give up on your goal.
- you dont use people
- You are a experienced coder and have a good taste of old RS =)......
~RuneLord Related~
RuneLord is a good economy server wich has a 300XP Hit, it has many of it&#39;s own quests, a 100% Boxing Ring with working boxing gloves, fixed dark bow anim and c&#39;bow...
Barley laggs after we played around with the Login Handler....
We add Special Event&#39;s each time we have theres a celebration day.. like easter, Christmas etc.
We use anti-lagg so when we update it doesnt shut the server down it would only make a 1 second connection lost to keep them online and not make them quit..
We have a hang out zone with bh 100% and a new minigame called 
Camp (under construction) and battlefield!
Why do you think this will be succesful?
Well many players have loved the server and we got 10 players in 5 minutes once..
We have a cool custom tour that takes them all around RuneLord well... Show&#39;s them places and keeps them company.
We will be having a minigame Guide soon too..
We know this will be succesfull because we have a staff that never gives up and always there except for one lazy staff member...
Well, if you would like to join the private server, then you are most welcome, but if you dont you loose because probably in 1-2 years it could be one of the best..
I&#39;m not trying to brag or anything... But yeah.
