    <title>Sound card playing up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sound-card-playing-up/239685</link>
    <description>Right, last week I bought 4gb ram for my comp, when we put it in we turned on the computer. Everything was working just fine. Then I completely wiped my disk and installed windows XP. But the soundcard wasn&#39;t working. The computer knew it was there, Just wouldn&#39;t use it. I decided to download the latest realtek driver hoping it would fix it. When I installed it I restarted my computer and it seemd to have worked. I then installed all my regular programs like Photoshop, Dreamweaver and uTorrent, restarted my computer and what do you know. The soundcard wasn&#39;t working again :mad:. I poked around and reinstalled the latest drivers numerous times. After getting fed up I left my computer on standby and waited for my brother to come home because he is more of and expert than I am. When we turned it on it worked again. My brother said well there can&#39;t be anything wrong with it, things just don&#39;t decide to work when they feel like it. I then turned off my computer. The next morning I turned it on again, and surprisingly enough my sound card wasn&#39;t working again. My brother had a look, he thought it might have been the power supply. Luckly my brother had an old 700w power supply, so we replaced my 250w with his old one. No difference.
I have spent enough time trying to find a reason for this. The sound card is built onto the motherboard, It is protected by a small metal case, so there is no way I could have broken it while setting the new ram in.

I was hoping someone here might have an answer.

If your answer is, &quot;Have you checked the BIOS?&quot;.
My answer is, &quot;Yes, There is only an option to turn it on and off.&quot;.

Thanks for any help,
Regards Chris.</description>

              <p>I returned the pci card to the shop, because it was doing the exact same as the on board card. If I put my computer on standby and then back on it works for some reason. It does the same for the scroll wheel on my mouse and my graphics card plays up untill it’s been on stand by. Any one know whats wrong? I have all the latest drivers.</p>

              <p>Same happened here lol. Those inputs on the card are probably MIDI inputs/outputs. Do what MITB said and it should work properly.</p>

<p>I have had about 3 computers with integrated sound that just flat out doesn’t work anymore.  It is not even a driver issue because no sound comes out with any operating system (windows, linux, freebsd etc).  The only solution I have found is go to the store and buy a cheap PCI sound card and put it in, that works.</p>

<p>Same thing happened with my computer. And I used the same solution. It’s crazy how on board sound seems to just decide to give up randomly more than any other components.</p>

              <p>Make sure your onboard sound card is turned off and you have the drivers installed for your new card and it activated.  You shouldn’t need any internal wires plugged into it.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I have to wait till Thursday when they get them in :P, atleast I know that it probobally can’t be fixed. Thanks.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 31, 2008, 06:54:15 pm[/size][hr]OK, I bought a new PCI soundcard for 20 euro. I put it in, tried turning the on computer and all that happend was nothing. Everything worked but nothing loaded. I then noticed 3 sort of plugs on the top of my soundcard like it needed a power supply. I looked at the on board sound card and noticed a cable going into it. I placed that cabe onto the soundcard. Still no luck. Finally I took the battery out to reset the bios and put it back in. And guess what. STILL NO FUCKING LUCK!. After a while i got fed up and left it. I took the battery out and left it out over night. Turned on my computer and the gremlins living inside my computer must have felt sorry for me and went back to work. I disabled the onboard souncard in bios and rebooted, then I installed the driver I got on a cd with my soundcard. But guess what. IT ISN’T FUCKING WORKING!</p>
<p>It’s not muted.<br>
The speakers are plugged in.</p>
<p>The cable that I put on the soundcard from the onboard one is back in the onboard one, It goes from a RGB card to my TV/Radio card and the into onboard sondcard. Anyone got a clue what it’s for?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
