    <title>Help with portforwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-portforwarding/387467</link>
    <description>So I have ported correctly my router, I have added the exceptions into my firewall, there are no exceptions listings on avast that I am seeing for ports as well. 

So my question is, what else could be blocking the port? Every time I go to the portforward port checker it says the port is not open.

I am using a tl-wr740n router.
