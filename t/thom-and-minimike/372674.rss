    <description>No, I am not asking for help, and dnt flame me... U dnt have to answer

So, yea. Some1 who calls himself Thom or something, and some1 who calls himself godlyadmin claims to own Banch-Pkz or something, and says they have a name. I am just wondering if any1 have heard about them?

I am asking you here, as they couldn&#39;t even code a delta when i last checked.

If this does not belong here, tell me =\</description>
