    <description>[i]Applies to anyone who has registered at[/i] [url=http://villavu.com/forum/]Villavu:[/url]
[size=10pt]
[b][u]Change your passwords here (mscp) if you use the same details there (villavu).
Not doing so could result in account theft.[/u][/b][/size]

From The Homepage:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, we got cracked. (This is not worthy of the name &#39;&#39;hack&#39;&#39;; see wikipedia on what hacking is)
Please change your passwords if you used a similar one on other sites (this includes your EMAIL)!
If you used it anywhere else, don&#39;t ever share passwords among sites again!!!
Additionally, please make sure that you change any passwords you may have used in private messages, etc.

Note by Wizzup:

The incident occured due to a mistake on my side. I&#39;m really sorry; someone
posing as BraK told me he had forgotten his password. I happened to recall
BraKs old email address. I asked him to verify using that one, and he was able
to send me a mail using that address. I thus assumed that this was BraK.
I was not aware that this email address was no longer under his control.

We then went on to reset his modcp and admincp pass (which is shielded
by another password)

Using some admincp hack he got access to our passwords. We have no reason
to believe they also took the rest of the forum contents, but please don&#39;t
take my word for it.

All the other stuff should not be harmed. This includes:
 * simba.villavu.com (for Simba binaries)
 * stats.villavu.com
 * wizzup.org
 * paste.villavu.com (paste service)

IF YOU HAD PASSWORDS STORED IN PRIVATE MESSAGES, CHANGE THEM.

Let me also take this opportunity to lecture you on personal data:

   Never rely on third parties to store your data unless their sole 
   service is in fact hosting your data. Don&#39;t use Facebook for your 
   data, photos, etc.

I&#39;m sorry for the inconvenience. I&#39;m also sorry for the time I&#39;ll take me
to verify everything and get VillaVu back up again.

Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be back, as always...
Time indication? Anything from one day to a week or so.
But I&#39;ll probably go and sleep first. :-)

For any questions; please visit the IRC (irc.rizon.net #srl) or drop
me a mail you can find my email at my website: http://wizzup.org/#contact
