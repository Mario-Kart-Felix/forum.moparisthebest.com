    <title>[pi] combat system and familiars [rep++]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-combat-system-and-familiars-rep/397939</link>
    <description>hey right so im working on summoning for my PI server and all working okay until your in combat with your familiar and the familiar does more damage against the opponent, should the opponent be another npc then there is no drop :S whereas if the opponent is a player then the drop appears for the player who died, meaning the damage isnt counting. so what i need help with is figuring out how to make the damage dealt by the familiar count as the players damage when checking for drops.

any help is appreciated :)

thanks in advance
