We didn&#39;t believe we were going to get several kids in two pregnancies,&quot;  she states.A growing dilemma is who pays for these kinds of pregnancies. Although Lebowitz got insurance, most plans don&#39;t cover fertility therapy so partners have to foot the bill alone. It&#39;s a method that can cost as much as $10,000 a try, and doctors say many could only afford to take only one gamble, reports CBS News Correspondent Pascal Murphy.&quot;A couple may state, &#39;I have five ovum developing, I am spending money on this out of pocket, I can only do one cycle because of the fees. I will take the chance of having multiple a pregnancy,&#39;&quot; says Dr. Robert Stillman, a fertility expert.For those who take which chance and abruptly end up with huge people, the hospital bills on your own can run from the hundreds of thousands of us dollars.
