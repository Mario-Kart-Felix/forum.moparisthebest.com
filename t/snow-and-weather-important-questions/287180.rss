    <title>Snow and Weather: Important questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/snow-and-weather-important-questions/287180</link>
    <description>Hey, I am using Pwnscape source, and was wondering how to make it snow. I know that snow apparently make my server glitchy and that I cannot see. But I have thoughts about this. I have used the search bar and google and failed to find any tutorials or other peoples posts where the answer is actually given. SO, if you would have time to explain how to do this, or have the link to a tutorial on how to make it snow, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Also, Is it possible to make fog in the background on my server? I know 508/525s have it. But is it possible to do it on a 317? 

First question is probably most important. 

Thanks a lot
