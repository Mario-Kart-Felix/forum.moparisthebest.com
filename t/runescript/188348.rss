    <title>RuneScript ; )</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescript/188348</link>
    <description>So I got bored of 2 of my other projects and decided to hold them off for a little bit :)

Why? To experiment!

I am trying to see how far I can go into reproducing the runescripts ;D, Well it&#39;s not really runescript because no one really knows for sure exactly what it looks like, or exactly how it makes the game function... So I will take what ever is out there and put it all into a nice little package for one day to be released if anyone else becomes curious.

ex:
&lt;blockquote&gt;openshop(shop);&lt;/blockquote&gt;


But for now (without trying anything), I&#39;m curious... How would I know if I should be using a string or an Integer? (yes i know my java basics :P and know the difference, but just asking to see if theres something that can tell you which type of a variable to use).

example:

openshop(shop);

shop = # of shop? So it would be integer correct? So does that mean i should just do what I;ve been doing so far :P? Trial and error?

The package will be in the same folder so the programmers can call up on it into the file they like without adding more lines of code to their main ;D
(im bothering to try it because i still believe that its nothing but java... or at least the same syntax :P)</description>

              <p>Well, we can assume every shop has a GUID, or “globally unique identifier”. For convenience, we’ll also assume we’re using a conventional SQL database. This is a number which is “unique” in that it is only attributed to <span class="bbcode-u">one</span> row of data in our hypothetical “shops” table.</p>
<p>openshop(id); would be fed the GUID of a shop as its required argument (in this instance, the GUID will simply be 1). The function itself would then pull that particular shop’s information from our database, calling it by the ID - the GUID - we supplied.</p>
