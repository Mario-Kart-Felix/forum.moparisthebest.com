    <title>Help with PK POINTS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-pk-points/227229</link>
    <description>Okay just about every server I see, it has PK Points... well I showed everyone my Clan Wars release, but I still some help with some things... so what I need is a way to make Clan Wars points... but heres what I need

-The Clan Wars points (so when you kill someone in Clan Wars it gives you points)
-A Clan Wars Zone (kind of like the nonWild() thing, only clanWars() instead, so that the game recognizes that you are in Clan Wars and when you kill someone in the Clan Wars Zone, it gives you Clan Wars points... get it?)

so yeah those are just a few things I need help with (yes I will give credits when I show/release Clan Wars v2. but still a long way away from v2. but if you would like to help, pm me, or if you know the answer right off, just post a comment on how I could do it, not a full fucking description that is in almost perfect detail, just basic directions that will get me started... thanks

(again, I will give credits to those people that help me)</description>

No, you would add something like this into the void youdied().</p>
<p><code>if(clanWars()) {
 teleportToX = ####;
 teleportToY = ####;
 heightLevel = 0;
 //pEmote = 15;
 //pWalk = 13;

 hitDiff = 0;
 updateRequired = true; 
 appearanceUpdateRequired = true;

Also, you would add an extra bracket to the end of youdied().<br>
EDIT:That’s to make it so you don’t loose items BTW.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>yeah but still, how could I make it to where when you kill someone in clan wars, it gives you clan wars points?<br>
also I’m trying to do this thing where instead of Danger and Safe zones, I would also have a Clan Wars zone, so that it would show Clan Wars on the side instead of Danger on the side…[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 21, 2008, 03:39:38 pm[/size][hr]anyone??[/quote]<br>
To do that you could add something like this in your public boolean clanWars(), so example:</p>
<p><code>public boolean clanWars() { // By Jordie
	if(absX &gt;= XCOORD &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= XCOORD &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= YCOORD &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= YCOORD)
        clanPoints();
	return true;
	else
		return false;
}</code><br>
I think, not sure, not thinking.<br>
In the void clanPoints() you could add something like this…</p>
<p><code>
public void clanPoints() {
if killplayershithere
clanPks =+ 1;?
//You could make the interface change if you're in clanwars, by using the public boolean clanWars, To be honest I'm not sure.</code></p>

Yeah, make a new one using character tokens, like WRX said there’s a good example of them in his tutorial, so like this: (Depending on what you made)<br>
if (clanKills == 1) {<br>
some stuff<br>
sendMessage("You killed sumone naow ur points r " + clanKills + “kay”);?<br>
