    <title>Adding a command to unlock commands?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-a-command-to-unlock-commands/454291</link>
    <description>How would I try this? I know what file but I&#39;ve got no clue how to go about it. does anyone have any examples they can show me? I want the unlock command to only work for staff and no staff commands can be used without entering it in. Read title if you&#39;ve got no clue what I&#39;m talking about.</description>

I can help you tommorow. You could give it a shot though. It’s all in command handler.  Have a Boolean variable (passwordUnlocked) for if the password was unlocked, default being false. Create a command that unlocks it by taking and argument (password) and comparing it to the password you set, if it’s correct make the variable true. Now have another get class (getPw) to see if the variable is true or false. Finally, on the commands you want password protected add &amp;&amp; getPw();. (make sure it’s in the bracket).</p>
<p>Hope I explained that alright. The rscangel source had it in their source (give credits of course). Give it a shot, if I doesn’t work I’ll help ;D.<br>
[/quote]You wouldn’t want it set up like that. You want each player to unlock the commands, so logically, the variable belongs to a player, not the command handler.</p>
<p>Something similar to what you had in mind could be described as a service.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">object AuthenticationService {
  private var authedUsers = List[WeakReference[Player]]() 

  def isAuthed(p : Player) = authedUsers.contains(p)
  def auth(p : Player, password : String) = {
    if (password == Config.COMMAND_PASSWORD) {
      authedUsers ::= new WeakReference(p)
    } else {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid password")
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The above can easily be converted to Java, but I prefer writing Scala in the browser.[/quote]<br>
My bad you are right</p>
