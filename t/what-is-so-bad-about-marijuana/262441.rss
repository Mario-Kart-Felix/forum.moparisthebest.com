    <title>What is so bad about Marijuana?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-so-bad-about-marijuana/262441</link>
    <description>I always see people dissing marijuana. I don&#39;t understand what is so bad about it. I understand why they diss stuff like cigarettes, and acid and stuff, but why weed? I have been smoking since 8th grade, and I have never run into any health/social problems because of it. I always see people saying its &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;ruins your life&quot; &quot;youll die from it&quot;... but really, you dont. I ask people why its so bad and they say &quot;cuz its illegal it must be bad duh!&quot;. The real reason they don&#39;t legalize it anyway is because it would ruin the economy.</description>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You’re a little confused. delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol does NOT stay in your body for months. It is metabolised fairly quickly to 11-hydroxy-thc (amongst other active metabolites) and then those are further broken down into inactive metabolites which are stored in fat cells. They no longer have any psychoactive effect on the human body, they do however provide a way for people to tell if you’ve smoked recently (piss tests/ blood tests etc).</p>
<p>Pretty much every chemical you consume is broken down this way and has some form of inactive metabolite that stays in your body for some amount of time (usually a lot shorter, but it makes no difference)</p>
<p>EDIT: Anotehr example of the wonders that is in vivo metabolism: when one smokes tobacco (or ingests nicotine in any other way) a primary metabolite of that process is cotinine, which is detectable in the body for days after the cigarette was smokes - dosen’t stop cravings though, does it? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Metabolites are not the same as the drug that was consumed.</p>
<p>TLDR:<br>
11-nor-9-carboxy-thc, one of the long half-life secondary metabolites has NO PSYCHOACTIVE EFFECT. Once you are not stoned anymore, you are not stoned anymore.</p>

<p>The fact that your fat stores it doesn’t mean much. It’s not even psychoactive anymore. I work out often and play sports, I don’t experience anything bad from marijuana still being in my fat cells.</p>
<p>“You can get psychosis and other psychic damage.”<br>
This isn’t proven. It’s only known to make pre-existing cases of mental disorders worse. If you are mentally healthy there’s not much to worry about. Unless you just don’t know about your “pre-existing” mental disorder.</p>
<p>Lose dexterity? Maybe if you smoke too much and you’re burnt out. This is just temporary.</p>

<p>I’m not in the US, I’m in the UK. I fully agree that 18-25 year olds are more likely to be worse drivers than older people, due to showing off &amp; simple lack of experience. However I fail to see what that has to do with drugs. I have never stolen, set fire to property that wasn’t mine or driven dangerously (or AT ALL) while under the influence of anything.

It’s funny that you say drug using friends will destroy your life, the drug using friends I’ve had have been my closest and best friends. Negative stereotypes are bad, yoh.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to use drugs, it’s always within your power to say no, whoever your friends are, jeez.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes if your friends respect your no, but not all can say no every time someone ask them.<br>
Ok, people with drugs don’t destroy you, but you should not get someone to start, not give them their first drugs.</p>
<p>And sorry for saying this, but you will get problem because of your drugs and alcohol.</p>
<p>Like you write in the crime tread:</p>

Dangerous Driving<br>

<p>I’m not going to deny that. You’re right. I was against most hard drugs. Before I started smoking pot, I liked the idea of shrooms from what I had read about them, but I was worried to do them (plus I didn’t have a connection for them) because of the way I’ve seen people get on them. Forcing themselves to puke so that they don’t get higher, wishing they were dead so that they wouldn’t have to endure a few more hours of the mental state they were in. As I smoked pot for a while after, I felt I was ready. I developed a huge interest in drugs, I find them absolutely fascinating. I used to read about every drug I could think of for hours simply because I was interested. I gradually became more open to doing the drugs I was reading about.</p>
<p>Now I’ll do a hard drug, and have a fun time. But they make me appreciate marijuana even more. It’s so easy, so reliable. And despite having a good time on the harder drugs, I always feel that I got my little fun in and that I don’t need to repeat the experience, or at least for a long time.</p>
<p>But if you are against harder drugs, you don’t have to do them. If someone is worried about smoking weed because it can lead to harder drugs, just remember only you can decide what you put into your body.</p>

<blockquote>"There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs."
<p>Source: Janet E. Joy, Stanley J. Watson, Jr., and John A Benson, Jr., “Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base,” Division of Neuroscience and Behavioral Research, Institute of Medicine (Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1999).</p>
<p>“Our key findings were that 1) there are no unique factors distinguishing the gateway sequence and the reverse sequence — that is, the sequence is opportunistic; 2) the gateway sequence and the reverse sequence have the same prognostic accuracy; and 3) a sizable proportion of substance users begin regular consumption with an illicit drug. These results, considered in the aggregate, indicate that the gateway sequence is not an invariant pathway and, when manifest, is not related to specific risk factors and does not have prognostic utility. The results of this study as well as other studies demonstrate that abusable drugs occupy neither a specific place in a hierarchy nor a discrete position in a temporal sequence. These latter presumptions of the gateway hypothesis constitute what Whitehead referred to as the ‘fallacy of misplaced connectedness,’ namely, asserting ‘assumptions about categories that do not correspond with the empirical world.’”</p>
<p>Source: Tarter, Ralph E., PhD, Vanyukov, Michael, PhD, Kirisci, Levent, PhD, Reynolds, Maureen, PhD, Clark, Duncan B., MD, PhD, “Predictors of Marijuana Use in Adolescents Before and After Licit Drug Use: Examination of the Gateway Hypothesis,” American Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 63, No. 12, December 2006, p. 2139.</p>
<p>“The gateway hypothesis holds that abusable drugs occupy distinct ranks in a hierarchy as well as definite positions in a temporal sequence. Accordingly, substance use is theorized to progress through a sequence of stages, beginning with legal, socially acceptable compounds that are low in the hierarchy, followed by use of illegal ‘soft’ and later ‘hard’ drugs ranked higher in the hierarchy. One of the main findings of this study is that there is a high rate of nonconformance with this temporal order. In a neighborhood where there is high drug availability, youths who have low parental supervision are likely to regularly consume marijuana before alcohol and/or tobacco. Consumption of marijuana prior to use of licit drugs thus appears to be related to contextual factors rather than to any unique characteristics of the individual. Moreover, this reverse pattern is not rare; it was observed in over 20% of our sample.”</p>

<p>“The results of this study suggest that general behavioral deviancy and not specific risk factors accounts for illicit drug use. When illicit drug use occurs first, it is very likely due to the opportunity afforded by the neighborhood environment in context of low parental supervision. The probability and rate of development of a diagnosis of marijuana use disorder and alcohol use disorder were the same whether or not there was conformance with the gateway sequence. Evidence supporting ‘causal linkages between stages,’ as specified by the gateway hypothesis, was not obtained. Nor were specific risk factors identified that were related to consumption of each drug. Our results indicate that efforts to prevent marijuana use should utilize strategies directed at averting the development of the characteristics prodromal to the manifestation of behavior problems.”</p>

<p>The Institute of Medicine’s 1999 report on marijuana explained that marijuana has been mistaken for a gateway drug in the past because “Patterns in progression of drug use from adolescence to adulthood are strikingly regular. Because it is the most widely used illicit drug, marijuana is predictably the first illicit drug most people encounter. Not surprisingly, most users of other illicit drugs have used marijuana first. In fact, most drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana – usually before they are of legal age.”</p>

<p>More than 100 million Americans have tried marijuana; 14.4 million Americans are estimated to be “past-month” users. Yet there are only an estimated 2,075,000 “past-month” users of cocaine and 153,000 “past-month” users of heroin.</p>
<p>Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings (Office of Applied Studies, NSDUH Series H-34, DHHS Publication No. SMA 08-4343), Rockville, MD, Sept. 2008, p. 250, Table G.1, and p. 254, Table G.5.</p>
<p>According to the 2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health:<br>
“In 2007, the average age at first marijuana use among recent initiates aged 12 to 49 was 17.6 years, which was similar to the average in 2006 (17.4 years) (Figure 5.4). Among recent initiates aged 12 or older who initiated use prior to the age of 21, the mean age at first use was 16.2 years in 2007, which was not significantly different from the estimate (16.1 years) in 2006.”<br>
“In 2007, the average age at first alcohol use among recent initiates aged 12 to 49 was 16.8 years, similar to the corresponding 2006 estimate (16.6 years). The mean age at first use among recent initiates aged 12 or older who initiated use prior to the age of 21 was 15.8 years, which was the same as the 2006 estimate.”<br>
“In 2007, among recent initiates aged 12 to 49, the average age of first cigarette use was 16.9 years, similar to the average in 2006 (17.1 years).”</p>

<p>"In 2007, the rate of current illicit drug use was almost 9 times higher among youths aged 12 to 17 who smoked cigarettes in the past month (47.3 percent) than it was among youths who did not smoke cigarettes in the past month (5.4 percent).<br>
“Past month illicit drug use also was associated with the level of past month alcohol use. Among youths aged 12 to 17 in 2007 who were heavy drinkers (i.e., consumed five or more drinks on the same occasion on each of 5 or more days in the past 30 days), 60.1 percent also were current illicit drug users, which was higher than the rate among nondrinkers (5.0 percent).”</p>

<p>A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association on cannabis and its possible role as a gateway drug found that “While covariates differed between equations, early regular use of tobacco and alcohol emerged as the 2 factors most consistently associated with later illicit drug use and abuse/dependence. While early regular alcohol use did not emerge as a significant independent predictor of alcohol dependence, this finding should be treated with considerable caution, as our study did not provide an optimal strategy for assessing the effects of early alcohol use.”</p>

<p>A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association on cannabis and its possible role as a gateway drug concluded that “While the findings of this study indicate that early cannabis use is associated with increased risks of progression to other illicit drug use and drug abuse/dependence, it is not possible to draw strong causal conclusions solely on the basis of the associations shown in this study.”</p>

<p>"Other mechanisms that might mediate a causal association between early cannabis use and subsequent drug use and drug abuse/dependence include the following:<br>
"1. Initial experiences with cannabis, which are frequently rated as pleasurable, may encourage continued use of cannabis and also broader experimentation.<br>
"2. Seemingly safe early experiences with cannabis may reduce the perceived risk of, and therefore barriers to, the use of other drugs. For example, as the vast majority of those who use cannabis do not experience any legal consequences of their use, such use may act to diminish the strength of legal sanctions against the use of all drugs.<br>
“3. Alternatively, experience with and subsequent access to cannabis use may provide individuals with access to other drugs as they come into contact with drug dealers. This argument provided a strong impetus for the Netherlands to effectively decriminalize cannabis use in an attempt to separate cannabis from the hard drug market. This strategy may have been partially successful as rates of cocaine use among those who have used cannabis are lower in the Netherlands than in the United States.”</p>

<p>In 2002 the English government published research on the initiation of drug use and criminal offending by young people in Britain. According to the study, “After applying these methods, there is very little remaining evidence of any causal gateway effect. For example, even if soft/medium drugs (cannabis, amphetamines, LSD, magic mushrooms, amyl nitrite) could somehow be abolished completely, the true causal link with hard drugs (crack, heroin, methadone) is found to be very small. For the sort of reduction in soft drug use that might be achievable in practice, the predicted causal effect on the demand for hard drugs would be negligible. Although there is stronger evidence of a gateway between soft drugs and ecstasy/cocaine, it remains small for practical purposes. My interpretation of the results of this study is that true gateway effects are probably very small and that the association between soft and hard drugs found in survey data is largely the result of our inability to observe all the personal characteristics underlying individual drug use. From this viewpoint, the decision to reclassify cannabis seems unlikely to have damaging future consequences.”</p>

<p>In March 1999, the Institute of Medicine issued a report on various aspects of marijuana, including the so-called Gateway Theory (the theory that using marijuana leads people to use harder drugs like cocaine and heroin). The IOM stated: “There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.”</p>

<p>The Institute of Medicine’s 1999 report on marijuana explained that marijuana has been mistaken for a gateway drug in the past because “Patterns in progression of drug use from adolescence to adulthood are strikingly regular. Because it is the most widely used illicit drug, marijuana is predictably the first illicit drug most people encounter. Not surprisingly, most users of other illicit drugs have used marijuana first. In fact, most drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana, usually before they are of legal age.”</p>

<p>No he is right, smoking weed is an entry to harder drugs, it is a proven fact(something like 90% try harder drugs after weed)!</p>
<p>But really, alcohol is the entry drug…</p>
