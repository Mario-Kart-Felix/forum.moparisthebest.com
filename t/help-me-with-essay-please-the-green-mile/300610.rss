    <description>I&#39;m suppose to be writing an essay for an interested adult explaining how the quote relate to the character John Coffey. I can use examples based on personal experiences, readings, or observations. The quote is by Charles Lamb, it goes &quot;Pain is life- the sharper, the more evidences of life&quot;. You don&#39;t have to know the whole story but [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Mile_%28novel%29]here&#39;s the plot summary[/url]. So far I have this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[center][size=16pt][b]The Green Mile[/b][/size]
[i][b]Essay: 1st draft[/b][/i][/center]

I am writing under the influence of Charles Lamb, “Pain is life-the sharper, the more evidence of life”, in the novel [u]The Green Mile[/u], based on John Coffee’s perspective.

After reading this novel I realized that people who have experienced pain throughout life are able to tell you a shocking story about it. John Coffey was an innocent convict that was seen guilty for his size, and his strange behavior. When, really William Wharton was the murderer of the two small, white girls. No one actually believed it was him though, except Paul Edgecombe (the narrator &amp; Cold Mountain Penitentiary block supervisor on death row, nicknamed “[i]The Green Mile[/i]”). Charles Lamb’s quote relates to the cruelty that John witnesses and interacts with throughout this novel, The Green Mile. It’s easy to research evidence, but it isn’t as hard as you would think to be apart of the occurring evidence, it’s much more to it then you thought afterwards.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

              <p>I think you are right because I don’t know the whole story of that essay. But as I read it,<br>
this book made me motivated to something which is very relevant. This story takes place in a nursing home.</p>
