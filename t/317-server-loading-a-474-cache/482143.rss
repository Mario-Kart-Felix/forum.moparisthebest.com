    <title>317 server loading a 474 cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-server-loading-a-474-cache/482143</link>
    <description>[size=18pt]Sorry if it&#39;s in the Wrong section :( and yes this is a [Req][/size]

So basically I want to start a new server. I want to start a 317 server loading a 474 cache (474 Map, Items, GFX, Animations, Interface etc.) and I don&#39;t know what one to get.

I would like to have the server as complete as possible (with all/most skills working 99% - 100%) and isn&#39;t edited to the extreme that it will be a RSPS. Now, I am not going to make a 2007 Remake or anything like that. It will be a server that I want to have in there. So custom shops and everything will be on there. For the Minigames I would love to have the main Minigames (Barrows, Pest Control) completed so then the people who go on the server can go for Barrows etc. The starting position and everything like that I don&#39;t really mind. I can sort that out myself when I get a server.

Also I just want to say that I don&#39;t want any custom items that are above 474. So no D claws, no Torva, No Chaotic no SOF etc.

I don&#39;t mind what Base I use (As long as it&#39;s easy to use and it&#39;s simple to navigate through) because I can go with what ever. (I&#39;ve used PI, Delta, Allstar, Czar etc). I will go with RuneSource or Hyperion if I have to (Just as long as the Code is easy and I can understand it)

Is there any server that fits my needs? If there isn&#39;t then is there one that is close to my needs? I have used the search bar and all that so.</description>

<p>No requests. The link I posted is probably the best you’re going to get and if you whine and complain how it has/doesn’t have something you want, you’re an ungrateful shit.</p>
