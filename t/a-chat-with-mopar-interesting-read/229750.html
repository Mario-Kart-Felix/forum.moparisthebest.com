Session Ident: moparisthebest
01[19:16] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; hi
01[19:16] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; sorry for the delay
01[19:17] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; please message me when you're back
[19:18] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; hey, im here
01[19:18] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
01[19:18] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; before we begin
01[19:19] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; I would like to inform you that you have the right to tell me not to include any part of the interview in the paper
[19:19] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; alright, understood
01[19:20] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; and that the interview would become much more interesting, if you give honest answers, 
01[19:20] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; rather than 
01[19:20] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; answers that could be found with simple research
01[19:20] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; it's just customary for me to inform you :)
01[19:21] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
01[19:21] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so let's start with the basics
01[19:21] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; around what time did you first start getting into programming
[19:21] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; senior year of high school, an intro to c++ class
[19:22] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; which was uh
01[19:22] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh C++, I assume you also had some sort of interest in runescape at the tme?
01[19:22] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; time*
[19:22] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 2004 is when I graduated high school I guess
[19:23] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; actually no, never even heard of runescape at the time
01[19:23] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; oh? so when did you first start playing runescape?
[19:23] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; about november of 05 or so
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh so it was at the time, when scar was starting to peak over other former bots?
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; even though scar is NOT a bot
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
[19:24] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; actually I didn't start looking into cheating on runescape until february of 06 or so
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; wow
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; that's quite recent
[19:24] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; wait
[19:25] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; my years are off
[19:25] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; november of 04 i started playihng, and feb of 05 started cheating :)
[19:25] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; sorry bout that
01[19:25] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh
01[19:25] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; that's ok
01[19:25] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so what was your first cheating community? kaitnieks perhaps?
01[19:25] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; and how were you informed about it?
[19:25] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; rstools.prv.pl is what I found first from a google search
01[19:26] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
[19:26] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I just got SCAR and some scripts from that site and wrote scripts on my own until probably april
[19:26] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; chriz's ironminerbanker was one
[19:26] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; along with gussy's smelter
01[19:27] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; what gave you the motivation to write the scripts on your own? Did you not trust the former scripts, or did you feel like you needed to contribute something.
[19:27] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; my first community
01[19:27] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; sorry about that go ahead
[19:28] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; was sythe.org I suppose, where I was promptly banned because I released a script that mined and banked iron and also mined coal in the guild
[19:28] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; and mutant squirrel thought it was a ripped pay script
01[19:28] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; haha
[19:28] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; so that kept me out of any community for another month or so till I found kaitnieks.com :P
[19:28] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; onto your next question
[19:29] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I just wrote them on my own because I didnt know there were communities I suppose
[19:29] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; and from the 2 sample scripts I had I got down the basic syntax and could figure out how to make them do what I wanted
01[19:29] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; wow impressive
[19:29] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; by then I already had taken an intro to java class at college in fall of 04
01[19:30] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so you learned syntax of pascal, by just looking at former scripts?
[19:30] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; and then like I already said, when I did try to contribute I got banned :P
[19:30] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yep
01[19:30] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; after being rejected from other communities, what made you trust kaitnieks? As far as I remember, you did contribute good amount on kaitnieks
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; lots of comments and writelns helped me understand what was going on
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; there were quite a few things I saw as superior about kaitnieks.com
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 1. no images in signature
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 2. no donator rank
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 3. you couldn't donate to get power (mod / admin)
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 4. no black market meant no scammers
[19:32] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 5. people were friendly and helpful, even when you asked stupid questions
[19:32] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; guess thats all I can think of for now...
01[19:32] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so is that what you were looking for in a community?
01[19:32] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; the idea of
[19:33] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; well, it just made me comfortable and willing to contribute
01[19:33] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; no profit within a community, but just a community of people combined together to help each other advance their knowledge of programming?
[19:33] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; i'd never been in an online community before, except sythe.org, and that just made me know of things I DIDNT want in a community
[19:33] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yes, pretty much what you said
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok then
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; judging from what you've been through
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; imagine that there were no communities
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; it was the old times with auto rune, where people would sell their bots for money
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; no discussion about them 
01[19:35] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; do you think, that the cheating community could advance as it has to this stage without the ideal of a community?
[19:35] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; honestly, I wasn't around in the RSC times, but i've heard a good deal about them
[19:35] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; and no, I don't think the community would have advanced much at all without a community that shares
01[19:36] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; So what do you think the community offers, that helps the cheating community grow so exponentially?
01[19:36] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; As andrew said "We advance our technologies, they just come back with smarter bots"
[19:37] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; open source has a lot to do with it in my opinion, I wouldn't have figured out how to deobfuscate and modify the client if it wasn't for the open source work of others
01[19:37] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; winterlove?
[19:38] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; saevion is the one who wrote the deobfuscator
01[19:38] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh
[19:38] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; winterlove wrote the first private server
01[19:38] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; speaking of that
01[19:39] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; how has the cheating community grown to now? I mean at my time scar scripts were the thing to do. But now it's all about private servers?
01[19:39] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; Is it a sign that the cheaters just don't care any more or
[19:39] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; there was an in-between period where all sorts of java bots ruled
01[19:40] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; the fact that they lost interest, and want to expand their knowledge in other areas
[19:40] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 99% of them were based on aryan, but most of them worked perfectly
[19:40] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 377 was the last of the so-called 'old-engine' clients, then the version hopped up to 400 and was an entirely different beast
01[19:41] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so basically
[19:41] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; how technical do you want me to get here? or is it sufficient to say that it was too different for any of the olds bots to adapt to without a complete rewrite?
01[19:41] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; yea that's sufficient
01[19:42] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; i just want to keep it as an overlook on how the community grew
01[19:42] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok let's take a step back real quick
[19:42] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; so back in the aryan days, it was rather easy to write a good bot with some slight java knowledge
01[19:42] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh
01[19:42] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; aryan was the first java bot for rs2?
[19:42] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; but now you have to be an expert in multiple fields to get anything to run at all, let alone be updateable and not detectable
[19:43] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; there were a few private ones beforehand, and sbot was public but closed-source, detectable, and you had to pay for it
01[19:43] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; cool
[19:43] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; but aryan was the first public, open source bot
01[19:43] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
01[19:43] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; let's take a step back
01[19:44] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; most people think moparisthebest.com is the new kaitnieks.com when kaitnieks informed the cheating community he can't be very active anymore
01[19:44] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; how did you convince the community to move to your site?
01[19:44] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; even though you weren't there from the rsc times
[19:44] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I never wanted to run a site really
[19:44] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; after kaitnieks.com shut down, he redirected everyone to raw's site
[19:45] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; who is a known scammer, and the whole thing was an obvious scam
[19:45] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I went to genodemon and ruler's site for a few days, but it just wasn't the same
[19:45] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; there was no even half-decent replacement for kaitnieks.com
[19:45] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; so after rumors that kaitnieks.com would reopen were squashed, and I was sure it was never coming back
[19:46] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I went about trying to remake it, my first post went so far to say that as soon as we got some admins back from kaitnieks.com that I would resign my staff position and let one of them take over
[19:47] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I told the people I knew from kaitnieks.com on MSN about the new site, and they felt comfortable there too
[19:47] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; so slowly the old community moved to the new site, as it was the next-best alternative
01[19:47] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; what was wrong with genodemon/ruler's site?
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; same old same old
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; black market
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; images in sig
01[19:48] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh ok got ya
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; the whole forum was based on selling ruler's bot
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; (which was a 100% rip of aryan)
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; donator ranks and the whole lot
01[19:49] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; speaking of that, correct me if i'm wrong
01[19:49] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; there are no post counts on your site correct?
[19:50] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; that was another thing as well, it still keeps track of post count but it isn't displayed on threads, you have to physically click on the profile to see it
01[19:50] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; because I assume you'd rather see quality posts instead of spam?
[19:50] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yes
01[19:51] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok almost done
[19:51] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; the premise is quality of quantity, ideally post count shouldn't matter
[19:51] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; oh, just remembered another thing I hate about just about all other sites
01[19:52] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; did any of the kaitnieks mods come to your community?
[19:52] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; they are usually called 'affiliates', sites would swap links and such, always thought that was stupid
[19:52] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yes, most of them came over in the beginning, but over the years most have gone away
01[19:53] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh, but new have come correct? Or do you feel that the community is slowly dying off?
[19:53] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; no, new have replaced the old, seems to be how the whole community goes
01[19:53] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; how much money do you have to pay to keep the site/servers running?
01[19:54] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; on average
[19:54] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yea, I think the only staff left from kaitnieks.com is Waffendennis, and he is so inactive he will probably be gone soon...
01[19:54] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; =/
[19:55] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I got a steal on a dedicated server for $49 a month, then I pay $9.99 a year for another host for the cache and $9.99 a year for each of the 3 domains (moparisthebest.com, moparisthebest.org, moparisthebest.com)
[19:55] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; also I've spent about $200 on extra RAM for that server
01[19:55] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; this all comes from your own pocket?
[19:56] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; in the beginning I had to pay it all out of my pocket, but about 8 months after the site first started the google ads started paying for it
[19:56] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; now it actually pays for itself and gives me a little extra beer money to boot
01[19:57] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so what was your motivation in the beginning to create a community, with nothing in exchange. Even though at the time many might have rejected your community as a replacement for kaitnieks?
01[19:57] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; did you ever feel like you wasted the money?
[19:57] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I just wanted the old community back and there was nothing else remotely close
[19:58] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; many people did reject the new community for the longest time, but as more and more came back they did as well
[19:58] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; in the beginning I just used shared hosting and such which was much cheaper, like $10 a month or so, so to me it was worth it
[19:59] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I actually had the domain and a crappy host before I installed forums, I just kept my files on it, and MoparScape Revolution (pre-private servers)
01[19:59] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; Would you concur with the statement that your community tries to avoid commerce, no market section, and even the script sales section is pretty much dead, compared to other forums.
[19:59] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; the host of that later screwed me over so the beginning of the forum lost a month or so, that sucked
01[20:00] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; o =/
01[20:00] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; that does suck
01[20:00] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; Although you could have easily made money selling your servers, why release them for free?
[20:00] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yes, we avoid commerce forcefully, eventually they conviced me to add a market section but its only for legitimate in-game trade that avoids scamming
[20:01] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; people don't seem to use the scar sales section anymore since the home of SCAR has pretty much moved to srl-forums
01[20:01] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; by servers, i mean private servers*
[20:02] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; because I believe all software should be free and open-source, that is how civilization advances, and it will be the future of software
01[20:02] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; good quote, thanks
01[20:03] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok one last thing
01[20:03] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; i know as time goes on, you're becoming more and more busy
01[20:04] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; what do you think is the future of the community, since RWT got banned, do you believe the community will progress more towards the private servers with the old pking methods? When do you think the community will come to a point where they don't need you to guide them anymore. Do you think that point is present, or is it in the future?

        <p>[code]<br>
01[20:05]  and do you think that point will represent an ideal community?<br>
[20:06]  well, i certainly can’t spend hours and hours online a day like I used to in the beginning of college, but I try to never let more than a weekend go by without getting on and dealing with what needs dealt with<br>
[20:06]  the future of the community<br>
[20:07]  really the really good hackers/programmers that made the best bots have never been in it for the money anyhow, just for the challenge<br>
[20:07]  thats why the software is released freen and open source in the first place, sort of to ‘stick it to the man’ rather than for monetary gain<br>
[20:08]  so I don’t think the elimination of RWT will stop any of those, its simply that the new engine is much more painful to keep up with and the people that are experianced enough to actually deal with it are too busy with college and/or work, since they are older now<br>
[20:09]  the community has been progressing towards private servers since they first came out<br>
[20:09]  but as you can tell by the physical split of <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/moparisthebest.com</a> they are quite different communities all together<br>
01[20:10]  yet they both represent the cheating community?<br>
[20:10]  so they tend to progress seperatly<br>
01[20:10]  can you tell me one big difference between them?<br>
[20:10]  no, there is a private server community and a cheating community<br>
[20:10]  the private server community was simply formed originally by the cheating community<br>
01[20:10]  ok got ya<br>
[20:10]  it actually still surprises me about people in the private server community complaining about cheating on thier servers<br>
01[20:11]  lmao<br>
[20:11]  there are many people who consider cheating on the game wrong and wouldn’t do it, but see no problem in private servers<br>
[20:11]  haha, it actually reminds me<br>
[20:11]  when I released moparscape 3.0, which was the first/only private server client to have aryan built into it<br>
[20:12]  I got quite a few PMs begging me to make it identify itself somehow, by sending an extra packet or something along those lines so they could ban the moparscape client from thier servers<br>
[20:12]  because they didn’t want cheating on thier servers <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
01[20:12]  lol<br>
01[20:12]  don’t you think<br>
[20:12]  I told them in that case they better start writing some anti-cheating methods just like jagex does<br>
01[20:13]  that stealing jagex idea of runescape by creating private server is just as much cheating as actually cheating in the game?<br>
[20:14]  well, they are different concepts I think, I don’t believe private servers really harm jagex in any way<br>
01[20:14]  ok last question I SWEAR<br>
01[20:15]  let’s have a step way back<br>
[20:15]  hehe, its alright<br>
01[20:15]  from the knowledge you have gained as a leader of the new community<br>
01[20:15]  do you think the old programmers originally coded to harm runescape, or just for the challenge of coding artificial intelligence?<br>
[20:16]  I don’t think anyone has ever coded to harm runescape, but either for the money to be made or the challenge of beating jagex<br>
[20:17]  and again, the best by far only code for the challenge <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smiley1bce.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
01[20:17]  that’s true <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
01[20:17]  thanks for your time<br>
[20:17]  no problem<br>
[20:17]  so your going to write a paper about this?<br>
01[20:17]  do you mind if i post the paper or the interview on your forums?<br>
01[20:17]  yea<br>
01[20:18]  i have to write like 5 papers on a subculture<br>
01[20:18]  and i chose the rs cheating community<br>
[20:18]  actually I was just going to ask you to post it up after you are done <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
01[20:18]  lol cool, will do<br>
01[20:19]  gotta c +p this just in case<br>
01[20:19]  later thanks for the interview<br>
[20:19]  my client keeps logs in case you lose something<br>
[20:19]  also, you should consider giving kubuntu a shot <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (i see you use mirc, yuck)<br>
03[20:19] * Looking up moparisthebest user info…<br>
01[20:20]  ahh<br>
01[20:20]  kubuntu?<br>
01[20:20]  linux software?</p>
<p>[/code][br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 04, 2008, 08:48:51 pm[/size][hr]reserved for the paper if i can ever find it…</p>

        <p>This interview looked like it was conducted by a child. In fact, it was so bad that i gave up midway into the second half. It seemed each question was asked without any planning or preparation whatsoever.</p>
<p>Also, why on earth are you idolizing moparisthebest? It’s pretty clear this community is only ran for the money. I wouldn’t consider using another communities member base that much of an accomplishment.</p>
<p>Perhaps next time you will interview someone who has actually had a major part of where cheating is today.</p>

<p>I, also, didn’t quite like your interviewing style.<br>
You rushed and assumed things, and said “ahh” like every- fucking- sentance.</p>
