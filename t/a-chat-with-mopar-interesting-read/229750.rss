    <description>Note: I sincerely apologize for not posting this earlier mopar, I completely forgot I was supposed to post this here until I ran into it on my computer. I will post my accompanying paper later when I can find it somewhere... This is all unedited raw chat logs, so sorry for any typos.

Session Start: Mon Mar 10 19:16:15 2008
Session Ident: moparisthebest
01[19:16] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; hi
01[19:16] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; sorry for the delay
01[19:17] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; please message me when you&#39;re back
[19:18] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; hey, im here
01[19:18] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
01[19:18] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; before we begin
01[19:19] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; I would like to inform you that you have the right to tell me not to include any part of the interview in the paper
[19:19] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; alright, understood
01[19:20] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; and that the interview would become much more interesting, if you give honest answers, 
01[19:20] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; rather than 
01[19:20] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; answers that could be found with simple research
01[19:20] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; it&#39;s just customary for me to inform you :)
01[19:21] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
01[19:21] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so let&#39;s start with the basics
01[19:21] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; around what time did you first start getting into programming
[19:21] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; senior year of high school, an intro to c++ class
[19:22] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; which was uh
01[19:22] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh C++, I assume you also had some sort of interest in runescape at the tme?
01[19:22] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; time*
[19:22] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 2004 is when I graduated high school I guess
[19:23] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; actually no, never even heard of runescape at the time
01[19:23] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; oh? so when did you first start playing runescape?
[19:23] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; about november of 05 or so
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh so it was at the time, when scar was starting to peak over other former bots?
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; even though scar is NOT a bot
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
[19:24] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; actually I didn&#39;t start looking into cheating on runescape until february of 06 or so
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; wow
01[19:24] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; that&#39;s quite recent
[19:24] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; wait
[19:25] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; my years are off
[19:25] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; november of 04 i started playihng, and feb of 05 started cheating :)
[19:25] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; sorry bout that
01[19:25] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh
01[19:25] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; that&#39;s ok
01[19:25] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so what was your first cheating community? kaitnieks perhaps?
01[19:25] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; and how were you informed about it?
[19:25] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; rstools.prv.pl is what I found first from a google search
01[19:26] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
[19:26] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I just got SCAR and some scripts from that site and wrote scripts on my own until probably april
[19:26] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; chriz&#39;s ironminerbanker was one
[19:26] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; along with gussy&#39;s smelter
01[19:27] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; what gave you the motivation to write the scripts on your own? Did you not trust the former scripts, or did you feel like you needed to contribute something.
[19:27] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; my first community
01[19:27] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; sorry about that go ahead
[19:28] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; was sythe.org I suppose, where I was promptly banned because I released a script that mined and banked iron and also mined coal in the guild
[19:28] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; and mutant squirrel thought it was a ripped pay script
01[19:28] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; haha
[19:28] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; so that kept me out of any community for another month or so till I found kaitnieks.com :P
[19:28] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; onto your next question
[19:29] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I just wrote them on my own because I didnt know there were communities I suppose
[19:29] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; and from the 2 sample scripts I had I got down the basic syntax and could figure out how to make them do what I wanted
01[19:29] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; wow impressive
[19:29] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; by then I already had taken an intro to java class at college in fall of 04
01[19:30] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so you learned syntax of pascal, by just looking at former scripts?
[19:30] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; and then like I already said, when I did try to contribute I got banned :P
[19:30] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yep
01[19:30] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; after being rejected from other communities, what made you trust kaitnieks? As far as I remember, you did contribute good amount on kaitnieks
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; lots of comments and writelns helped me understand what was going on
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; there were quite a few things I saw as superior about kaitnieks.com
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 1. no images in signature
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 2. no donator rank
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 3. you couldn&#39;t donate to get power (mod / admin)
[19:31] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 4. no black market meant no scammers
[19:32] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 5. people were friendly and helpful, even when you asked stupid questions
[19:32] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; guess thats all I can think of for now...
01[19:32] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so is that what you were looking for in a community?
01[19:32] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; the idea of
[19:33] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; well, it just made me comfortable and willing to contribute
01[19:33] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; no profit within a community, but just a community of people combined together to help each other advance their knowledge of programming?
[19:33] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; i&#39;d never been in an online community before, except sythe.org, and that just made me know of things I DIDNT want in a community
[19:33] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yes, pretty much what you said
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok then
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; judging from what you&#39;ve been through
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; imagine that there were no communities
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; it was the old times with auto rune, where people would sell their bots for money
01[19:34] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; no discussion about them 
01[19:35] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; do you think, that the cheating community could advance as it has to this stage without the ideal of a community?
[19:35] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; honestly, I wasn&#39;t around in the RSC times, but i&#39;ve heard a good deal about them
[19:35] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; and no, I don&#39;t think the community would have advanced much at all without a community that shares
01[19:36] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; So what do you think the community offers, that helps the cheating community grow so exponentially?
01[19:36] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; As andrew said &quot;We advance our technologies, they just come back with smarter bots&quot;
[19:37] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; open source has a lot to do with it in my opinion, I wouldn&#39;t have figured out how to deobfuscate and modify the client if it wasn&#39;t for the open source work of others
01[19:37] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; winterlove?
[19:38] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; saevion is the one who wrote the deobfuscator
01[19:38] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh
[19:38] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; winterlove wrote the first private server
01[19:38] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; speaking of that
01[19:39] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; how has the cheating community grown to now? I mean at my time scar scripts were the thing to do. But now it&#39;s all about private servers?
01[19:39] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; Is it a sign that the cheaters just don&#39;t care any more or
[19:39] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; there was an in-between period where all sorts of java bots ruled
01[19:40] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; the fact that they lost interest, and want to expand their knowledge in other areas
[19:40] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 99% of them were based on aryan, but most of them worked perfectly
[19:40] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; 377 was the last of the so-called &#39;old-engine&#39; clients, then the version hopped up to 400 and was an entirely different beast
01[19:41] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so basically
[19:41] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; how technical do you want me to get here? or is it sufficient to say that it was too different for any of the olds bots to adapt to without a complete rewrite?
01[19:41] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; yea that&#39;s sufficient
01[19:42] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; i just want to keep it as an overlook on how the community grew
01[19:42] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok let&#39;s take a step back real quick
[19:42] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; so back in the aryan days, it was rather easy to write a good bot with some slight java knowledge
01[19:42] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh
01[19:42] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; aryan was the first java bot for rs2?
[19:42] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; but now you have to be an expert in multiple fields to get anything to run at all, let alone be updateable and not detectable
[19:43] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; there were a few private ones beforehand, and sbot was public but closed-source, detectable, and you had to pay for it
01[19:43] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; cool
[19:43] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; but aryan was the first public, open source bot
01[19:43] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok
01[19:43] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; let&#39;s take a step back
01[19:44] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; most people think moparisthebest.com is the new kaitnieks.com when kaitnieks informed the cheating community he can&#39;t be very active anymore
01[19:44] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; how did you convince the community to move to your site?
01[19:44] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; even though you weren&#39;t there from the rsc times
[19:44] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I never wanted to run a site really
[19:44] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; after kaitnieks.com shut down, he redirected everyone to raw&#39;s site
[19:45] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; who is a known scammer, and the whole thing was an obvious scam
[19:45] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I went to genodemon and ruler&#39;s site for a few days, but it just wasn&#39;t the same
[19:45] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; there was no even half-decent replacement for kaitnieks.com
[19:45] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; so after rumors that kaitnieks.com would reopen were squashed, and I was sure it was never coming back
[19:46] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I went about trying to remake it, my first post went so far to say that as soon as we got some admins back from kaitnieks.com that I would resign my staff position and let one of them take over
[19:47] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I told the people I knew from kaitnieks.com on MSN about the new site, and they felt comfortable there too
[19:47] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; so slowly the old community moved to the new site, as it was the next-best alternative
01[19:47] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; what was wrong with genodemon/ruler&#39;s site?
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; same old same old
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; black market
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; images in sig
01[19:48] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh ok got ya
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; the whole forum was based on selling ruler&#39;s bot
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; (which was a 100% rip of aryan)
[19:48] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; donator ranks and the whole lot
01[19:49] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; speaking of that, correct me if i&#39;m wrong
01[19:49] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; there are no post counts on your site correct?
[19:50] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; that was another thing as well, it still keeps track of post count but it isn&#39;t displayed on threads, you have to physically click on the profile to see it
01[19:50] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; because I assume you&#39;d rather see quality posts instead of spam?
[19:50] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yes
01[19:51] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok almost done
[19:51] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; the premise is quality of quantity, ideally post count shouldn&#39;t matter
[19:51] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; oh, just remembered another thing I hate about just about all other sites
01[19:52] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; did any of the kaitnieks mods come to your community?
[19:52] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; they are usually called &#39;affiliates&#39;, sites would swap links and such, always thought that was stupid
[19:52] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yes, most of them came over in the beginning, but over the years most have gone away
01[19:53] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ahh, but new have come correct? Or do you feel that the community is slowly dying off?
[19:53] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; no, new have replaced the old, seems to be how the whole community goes
01[19:53] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; how much money do you have to pay to keep the site/servers running?
01[19:54] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; on average
[19:54] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yea, I think the only staff left from kaitnieks.com is Waffendennis, and he is so inactive he will probably be gone soon...
01[19:54] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; =/
[19:55] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I got a steal on a dedicated server for $49 a month, then I pay $9.99 a year for another host for the cache and $9.99 a year for each of the 3 domains (moparisthebest.com, moparisthebest.org, moparisthebest.com)
[19:55] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; also I&#39;ve spent about $200 on extra RAM for that server
01[19:55] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; this all comes from your own pocket?
[19:56] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; in the beginning I had to pay it all out of my pocket, but about 8 months after the site first started the google ads started paying for it
[19:56] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; now it actually pays for itself and gives me a little extra beer money to boot
01[19:57] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; so what was your motivation in the beginning to create a community, with nothing in exchange. Even though at the time many might have rejected your community as a replacement for kaitnieks?
01[19:57] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; did you ever feel like you wasted the money?
[19:57] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I just wanted the old community back and there was nothing else remotely close
[19:58] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; many people did reject the new community for the longest time, but as more and more came back they did as well
[19:58] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; in the beginning I just used shared hosting and such which was much cheaper, like $10 a month or so, so to me it was worth it
[19:59] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; I actually had the domain and a crappy host before I installed forums, I just kept my files on it, and MoparScape Revolution (pre-private servers)
01[19:59] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; Would you concur with the statement that your community tries to avoid commerce, no market section, and even the script sales section is pretty much dead, compared to other forums.
[19:59] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; the host of that later screwed me over so the beginning of the forum lost a month or so, that sucked
01[20:00] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; o =/
01[20:00] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; that does suck
01[20:00] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; Although you could have easily made money selling your servers, why release them for free?
[20:00] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; yes, we avoid commerce forcefully, eventually they conviced me to add a market section but its only for legitimate in-game trade that avoids scamming
[20:01] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; people don&#39;t seem to use the scar sales section anymore since the home of SCAR has pretty much moved to srl-forums
01[20:01] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; by servers, i mean private servers*
[20:02] &lt;moparisthebest&gt; because I believe all software should be free and open-source, that is how civilization advances, and it will be the future of software
01[20:02] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; good quote, thanks
01[20:03] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; ok one last thing
01[20:03] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; i know as time goes on, you&#39;re becoming more and more busy
01[20:04] &lt;knightstreak2&gt; what do you think is the future of the community, since RWT got banned, do you believe the community will progress more towards the private servers with the old pking methods? When do you think the community will come to a point where they don&#39;t need you to guide them anymore. Do you think that point is present, or is it in the future?

              <p>The point of this article was not about runescape cheating or botting. It is about how the new wide spread use of technologies have help spread up communities that freely exchange information. Whether you want to think on a large scale and talk about wikipedia, or in small scale and talk with a small community owner (in this case mopar) is up to you. The facts about the runescape cheating were only used to fill the readers in with a little bit of context, so they can understand what kind of information is shared within this community.</p>
<p>I am sure, there were a lot better candidates for this topic. But due to the demand on time, I was lucky enough to get mopar to schedule an interview with me, and since he met my requirements, I was happy. I do not regret the decision of using him over anyone else.</p>
<p>Greeny - why so defensive? I mean if you really didn’t learn anything new, then the best thing to do at times is read it and just ignore it?</p>
<p>Sorry, this was just meant to be a little form of entertainment and has gotten way out of proportion.</p>

If I wanted, I could have edited it to make it run smoothly, but I figured that most of you guys would be mature enough to read beyond the organization.

<p>If you didn’t learn anything, then I am impressed by your knowledge. Because, I can almost guarantee you, that you didn’t read the whole interview.</p>
<p>Mopar might in-fact have almost no significance to the cheating community. However, runescape cheating was not the topic of my interview or paper. If you can infer the true topic on which I was pushing at in my interview, then you may find out why Mopar is one of the best candidate for the interview.</p>
<p>[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 09, 2008, 09:39:04 pm[/size][hr]To the comment on no pre-made questions.</p>
<p>Trust me, I had around 50 pre-made questions, yet I could almost answer around 48 of them with a little bit of research. Since, I only had limited alloted time for the interview, I tried pushing topics which Mopar was comfortable in discussing with me. Maybe only 2-3 of the quotes from the interview were actually used in the paper. But those 2-3 quotes are what pushes the paper to the next level.[/quote]</p>
<p>I knew all of what was said. I also agree with greeny in saying that Semaphore or wL would have been better to talk to. In fact, it was Semaphore who taught me majority of what i do know about cheating.</p>

<p>A better person to interview, and I mean no offence to moparisthebest, would be Semaphore or wL.</p>
<p>I talked to Semaphore for around 30 mins about 2 weeks back and learned new things from the word go, and that’s quite remarkable seeing as I’ve been on this scene longer than him.</p>

<p>Also, why on earth are you idolizing moparisthebest? It’s pretty clear this community is only ran for the money. I wouldn’t consider using another communities member base that much of an accomplishment.</p>
<p>Perhaps next time you will interview someone who has actually had a major part of where cheating is today.</p>
