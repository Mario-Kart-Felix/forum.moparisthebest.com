    <title>Would a PI template be worth releasing? [Completely Cleaned Out]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-a-pi-template-be-worth-releasing-completely-cleaned-out/547137</link>
    <description>Hello guys, i have been working a few hours on this and was wondering if it is even any use to release in the downloads section so i don&#39;t release something and get flammed out for it:

I have a Project Insanity server with literally nothing in it. Just the structure of the files but nothing at all coded in the files. Not to sure if this is making since, but basically, it still contains all the packaging files: Server.Java, Client.Java, Player.Java.. Ect,... but there is nothing in them but the packaging specification. It is basically a file template to code it however you like.

Anyways, was wondering if this was even worth a release, i&#39;d like to hear it.</description>

<p>If you want to use it as a learning experience (not sure how, as I don’t know much of how this stuff works), then go for it. Anything that is going to help you learn how to do something better/new is worth doing.</p>
