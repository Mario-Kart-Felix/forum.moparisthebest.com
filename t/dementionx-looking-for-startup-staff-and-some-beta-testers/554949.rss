Hi everyone my name is Rob im the owner of an upcoming [718] RSPS named DementionX, i am planning the release for April 1, in the next three weeks i would like to put together a small team of staff members as well as some beta testers. If you are looking and willing to contribute to a project, send me a pm on skype or reply to this thread, teamspeak would be an asset for any team member and you must be mature, thank you for your time.
