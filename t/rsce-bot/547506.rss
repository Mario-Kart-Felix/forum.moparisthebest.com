<p>I think <a href="http://pkwith.me" rel="nofollow noopener">pkwith.me</a> is actually Hixk if memory serves, based on here and what I have seen on the Karamja forum. Mark Gore / T_x has a specific way of having a dyslexic seizure while typing on the keyboard which lacks punctuation, capitalization, spelling out entire words, and putting a general, non-sociopathic effort into completing a task or an explanation. With a reduced active vocabulary and frequent referral to “cba” and “cbf” as reasons for inaction, he is easily identifiable.</p>

<p>Maybe his nice but I remember reading threads were he would steal software and claim it as his own . That’s not someone I would trust personally.</p>

<p>So what has his generosity been traded for in return? That does shoot up some red flags if he is buying you things.</p>

In 2009, Mark Gore installed an IRCD for botnet C&amp;C on my VPS under the guise of hardening the firewall against UDP floods he had orchestrated. I discovered this and observed his botnet checking in with the IRCD before I terminated his access. He then went on to a powerbot forum, did the same to trick them into accepting his mitigation help, became an administrator, and last I heard, I believe from him directly if memory serves, he was infecting users there to grow his botnet.<br>

Past is past.  He’s a remarkably intelligent person and remarkably nice.  He ordered me a microphone, a VPS, lets me use a high-powered dedicated box.<br>
Learn to forgive, mate.  He doesn’t infect his own players.[/quote]<br>
“He doesn’t infect his own players.” Wish I knew how to bold this.<br>
Really? He doesnt infect his own players? Have you dealt with him before today?</p>
