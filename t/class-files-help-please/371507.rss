    <description>[font=verdana][size=small]I got a source from the server download section and am currently working on the project. When I started to work and check important items for spawning I noticed that the ags looked weird, like a blurite 2h sword... So I was confused and posted on how I could fix the problem... Everyone said that it was a client side problem, and that I need to go to models on the client side, however, there is no models on the client side on the server side... But then it got worse, I also noticed there was no class 8 folder, so I cannot add new items or anything... so if you could tell me any alternate folders you know of that is the same as class 8 that would be great, as for the models I cannot fix the ags problem because there is no models, (models is on the server side but that&#39;s not what the other people said on the other post). also if there is no alternative folder is there a different class 8 folder that I can get anywhere else?

[font=verdana][size=small]I would deeply appreciate if you could tell me because I want to fix ags, and add in claws =(.[/size][/font]
[font=verdana][size=small]THANKS! [/size][/font]</description>

              <p>[quote=“Mendorphins, post:2, topic:371507”]From what I just understood from that, is that you went to look for the Client.java for the client in the server folder?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Class8.java is in your <span class="bbcode-b">client</span> folder. If you don’t have one, re-download the source, because it didn’t download properly.</p>
<p>If this continues to fail, get a different client.</p>
<p>And you won’t just be able to open and view your models willy-nilly. You need either RSMV or a 3D modelling application like Blender or something. There’s a massive tutorial in the model section. Go look it up.[/quote]I have looked at the RSMV and watched some vids on youtube, but I did download the client three times over already and I really like the server don’t want to get rid of it =(</p>
