    <title>Battlefield: Bad Company - Review</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/battlefield-bad-company-review/216683</link>
    <description>Well i purchased the game the day it was released completed it within two days and have played quite a few online games and am ready to give a review for you guys.
This game is addictive, its so easy to pick up the controller and continue from where you left off or even just from a random mission. The Single player is something that is definately impressive. You play as Preston Marlow and you get thrown in to B-Company or &#39;Bad Company&#39; There you meet private Terrance Sweetwater and Haggard. Both of whom are in the same boat as you. The leader, you is generaly called sarge, is the only person in [i] history[/i] to have opted for a B-Company transfer. As you play through the game many twists and turns reveal themselves to you and your story is no longer about the army but personal gain. I will not give away what happens but it is a good story. The banter between the NPC&#39;s is most entertaining and listening to the radio station is quite fun aswell, but is ultimately a gimmic. Throughout the story mode you have to find collectables which are weapons, not gadgets. As long as you pick up one of each type of gun you get the collectable. Among collectables you will find gold crates which you are supposed to collect aswell. Giving up an extra 5 minutes of your time to drive down to a remote location on the map will most definately be worth your time.
The Minimap is great, its 3D but still easy to use and you can glance at relevant parts of the map at your choosing. The map itself is positively HUGE and you can spend ages exploring it looking for enemies,gold and collectables. There are a wide variety of vehicles and MG&#39;s to use in the game and at your leisure aswell. Throughout objectives you will find various gadgets like a laser designator or a rocket launcher you can choose which is best for you to complete the objective. In one mission you will receive alot of objectives making the mission longer and more exciting. The destructible enviroments can play a big part in your single player campaign or a small part depending on your own preference.
Online is definately expansive and explosive with the only game type being destroying the gold crates at the moment. There are vehicles a plenty and weapons for you to use. Something that miffs me off is the find all five weapons which are stupid you need to have: preordered the game, have ALL other battlefield games, sign up for their newsletter and two other things to unlock them stupid really but thats just personal opinion. The maps are brilliant and in depth the gadgets are cool and the trophies,wildcards and patches to unlock give the game a cool depth to it.</description>

It’s pretty good  game, one piece of criticism i guess would be that you have hold down the thumbstick to sprint, imho would have been better if you press it and you sprint for like 5 secs or something.<br>

But then if you was running an someone popped out from around a corner you couldn’t pull out your gun fast enough so you would be kiled.[/quote]<br>
exactly its slow enough as it is without forcing human error</p>

<p>You get them by killing another player with a knife and then you can display them, every player has their own unique dogtag and you can collect them you can get more than one dogtag for the same player to show they suck really bad by getting knifed repeatedly in a game, personally i have 25 dogtags and 18 of which are unique. They do nothing they are like the mugshots in burnout paradise just to show you are better than them</p>

              <p>I, personally, like the game. Haven’t neccessarily played the single-player mode enough to say anything about it, but so far the multiplayer experience is great.</p>
<p>Hip-fire is very inaccurate starting at mid-ranged distances from my experience, not too sure on that one. Gold Rush mode DOES get boring after a while, that’s for sure; conquest better be coming soon.</p>
<p>But for some reason, I can’t play the game too long or I get <span class="bbcode-i">really</span> bored. I mean it’s fun for maybe the first hour or two, but after that it seems to go by slow and boring. Maybe I’m still new and haven’t played it enough etc., but I had to stop after about two hours due to boredom and lack of concentration on the game.</p>
<p>The graphics, to me, seem strange after being used to Call of Duty’s graphics and textures. They seem so much more unrealistic compared to COD4’s, and I’m still getting used to the feel of the game. I’m not sure if it’s just me on that last statement, but I really thought the graphics were going to be better.</p>
<p>I’ve got a quick question, too. What are dog tags and what do they do? I haven’t really figured that out, and just can’t seem to have an idea. Apparently you steal them from other people or earn them, I just don’t know. So if anybody could answer, that’d be great.</p>
<p>There’s my two cents.</p>

<p>This game is really good, but only with friends. By yourself it’s not really fun and you kind of get bored and have to play single player. Got it on ps3 and xbox 360. Gotta say ps3 version has really nice looking clothing texture. Brilliant game.[/quote]<br>
i know it was more a general comment</p>

              <p>Yeah, i saw a video comparison on gametrailers and the 360 one had a more colourful look to it. Anyway i’m not sure about performance wise on the both games, i heard the 360 version is having trouble online or had trouble online and the ps3 version is having trouble with voip.</p>
<p>What is it with these next-gen games and them being released unfinished and untested? Seriously, maybe they should take a leaf out of kojimas book and spend as much time as they need on actually perfecting the game.</p>

<p>This game is really good, but only with friends. By yourself it’s not really fun and you kind of get bored and have to play single player. Got it on ps3 and xbox 360. Gotta say ps3 version has really nice looking clothing texture. Brilliant game.</p>
