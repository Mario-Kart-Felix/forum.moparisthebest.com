    <title>Please read. Unable to open output stream to character.log</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-read-unable-to-open-output-stream-to-character-log/261223</link>
    <description>Hi. Maybe you&#39;ve seen my last post that I didn&#39;t really get any help out of at all. I know i&#39;ve set up my ports, classpaths/paths, and everything else correctly; but one thing is stopping me from making any progress on developing my server. Any time I try to edit code the output stream is unable to be accessed and any changes i have made to text files, ie character files is undone. would someone enlighten me as to how I can solve this problem once and for all? Thank you. -Flipzro[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 08, 2009, 09:33:37 pm[/size][hr]: (</description>
