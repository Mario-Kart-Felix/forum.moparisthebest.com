    <title>[Forum Suggestion] Required Base Input?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/forum-suggestion-required-base-input/406248</link>
    <description>I enjoy helping people in the Server Help and Client Help sections, but 40% of my posts are &quot;What base is this...?&quot; because they do not post the base. (Project Insanity, Delta, Etc.)

I believe there should be some kind of rule to save the time of people that are willing to help.

Because I would be helping someone (I focus on PI), and after 20 minutes they FINALLY say, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s Delta btw.&quot;....</description>
