    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/membership-denied/228200</link>
    <description>Ok, this is the only thing i can think of that would logically make sence. if you have any other reasons why something like this would happen tell me.

A few months ago i gave my password to my cousin who gave it to a friend, who ... yeah.. you get the point. anyways, I finaly got my account back, and under control. i changed my pass, changed the recoveries, and sent a request to the staff when i changed them. 

After a while i forgot that i canceled my membership so they had no access to taking out cash and stuff from my moms visa when i wasn&#39;t even the one playing. well obviously this has completely worked against me. When i tried to renew it i keep getting the message that it has been denied. The only choices they give me are that of insufficiency in my moms card. Which i checked, my mom&#39;s card has nothing wrong with it and theres enough for 5 bucks that runescape membership requires at the least =.= 

Anyways, so I&#39;ve concluded that the reason why they won&#39;t accept it is because they don&#39;t want to be reliable for my moms credit card losing money to someone who gets a hold of my account again. So they just decided to deny the card all together to get rid of that scenario. If that is the case, they should at least give you some way to contact them through the website or something.

Anyone else have any suggestions as to why they would deny it? And has this happened to anyone before.</description>

              <p>Alright, my brother did this EXACT thing, and so I had to get his account “unlocked” &lt;&lt; only from subscribing, could still play.<br>
Sent a message into Jagex, they actually replied this time… holy jebus… and I get this:</p>
<blockquote>Dear Name,
<p>Thank you for contacting Jagex Billing Support.</p>
<p>Your subscription attempts have been declined by either your bank or our own fraud protection system. This decision was taken to protect the owner of the card because one (or more) security checks have failed.</p>
<p>Please note that if your bank approves the transaction but our own system has reason to reject your subscription attempt, any funds that have been reserved on your card will not be taken by us and will be released and returned to you after 4 - 5 working days.</p>
<p>If you attempt to subscribe again with these details, in order to make a successful payment, please ensure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are sufficient funds available on the account you are making a payment from.</li>
<li>You have correctly entered your card number and security (CVV) number.</li>
<li>You have correctly entered your full address and country as your card issuer has on record for you. This should be the address to which your card statement is sent. If you have moved recently, please double check this.</li>
<li>You have correctly entered your post/zip code if applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you continue to have problems subscribing with these details, you may wish to consider using an alternative payment method. For more information on the options available to you, I would advise you to consult the Billing articles in the ‘Billing’ section of the ‘Customer Support’ section of <a href="http://www.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.runescape.com</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this answers your query.</p>
<p>Please always refer to the Game Guide and Help link on the top of our website to find the answer to your queries quicker.</p>

</aside>
<p>I checked everything that has to do with the card. its nothing about it. I have enough, and i did visa as visa. Another thing that sucks, is that i tried getting it through phone for one month just so i could cash in my items for gold (tell the story later) but when i tried to get my pin number when i replied “Y” they didn’t send it back. i did the whole process 3 times and they still wont give me the pin number…</p>
<p>As for my item story, the kid that got on my account wasted 10m on a bunch of seeds, which are worthless now because I’m not a member. and i can’t trade them in free worlds. basically my cash is screwed because i can’t get my membership back. hopefully the value of those gayass seeds don’t go down.</p>

              <p>Ok, this is the only thing i can think of that would logically make sence. if you have any other reasons why something like this would happen tell me.</p>
<p>A few months ago i gave my password to my cousin who gave it to a friend, who … yeah… you get the point. anyways, I finaly got my account back, and under control. i changed my pass, changed the recoveries, and sent a request to the staff when i changed them.</p>
<p>After a while i forgot that i canceled my membership so they had no access to taking out cash and stuff from my moms visa when i wasn’t even the one playing. well obviously this has completely worked against me. When i tried to renew it i keep getting the message that it has been denied. The only choices they give me are that of insufficiency in my moms card. Which i checked, my mom’s card has nothing wrong with it and theres enough for 5 bucks that runescape membership requires at the least =.=</p>
<p>Anyways, so I’ve concluded that the reason why they won’t accept it is because they don’t want to be reliable for my moms credit card losing money to someone who gets a hold of my account again. So they just decided to deny the card all together to get rid of that scenario. If that is the case, they should at least give you some way to contact them through the website or something.</p>
<p>Anyone else have any suggestions as to why they would deny it? And has this happened to anyone before.</p>
