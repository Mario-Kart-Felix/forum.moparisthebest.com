    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-delete-npcs-and-change-what-their-saying-and/116014</link>
    <description>My server folder got messed up and restarted. But now I wanna delete a NPC or change what their saying and for e.g I wanna change what a NPC says like look here! I type look here! in client.java and it says it cant find it. Secondly, how do you delete NPC&#39;s? Also,  where it shows the equipment bonus&#39; of tiems how you change that to a diff colour and how you change your skill menu e.g where it shows your strength level and so on to a diff colour?</description>

              <p>delete npc’s<br>
stand on the npc and type ::coordson to find out they’re X and Y coord<br>
go into autospawn.cfg and search the coords then delete that guy</p>
<p>bonuses<br>
them colours can’t be changed, that i know of</p>
<p>stats menu<br>
go into client.java and search the command (“skillsmenu”)?<br>
then there’s either a void in there or the menu that comes up<br>
if it’s the void search that void<br>
if not you should see the lines of the stats<br>
like<br>
<span class="mention">@whi</span>@Str -<br>
or whatever<br>
change the <span class="mention">@whi</span>@</p>
