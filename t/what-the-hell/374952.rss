    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-the-hell/374952</link>
    <description>Note: Very stoned, excuse any grammar inperfections kthx

I smoked weed with my mother just now.  Up until this point she never knew I smoked, and swore to disown me if she ever caught me.  I came home from a christams eve party and she came home an hour later obviously drunk.  We decorated and were talking about pot and SOMEHOW it escillated to us smoking my bong in our family room.

I&#39;m freaking right the fuck out, tomorrow is going to be awckward as FUCK because shes going to regret it, and be pissed, and now she knows and FML.

Thread:
Please help me!  What the fuck do I doooo?</description>

That’s true - drinking alcohol is part of the Australian culture.</p>

This is hilarious!  I want an update on what happened the next day.<br>
[/quote]Well for the first post, I was very paranoid and what not and therefore was completely freaking out.  I’ve calmed down a little.  She hasn’t.</p>
<p>The good news was, it was xmas and family was over so nothing got said until after the festivities and guests left.  Then she was all over it.  “MICHAEL, I AM SO DISAPPOINTED ABOUT LAST NIGHT” blah blah blah and something about me losing both of my nuts if she ever catches me high, or finds weed in the house, and that she will be looking from now on.</p>
<p>In short, the next day was terrible.  And still is.  And will be until I move out![/quote]<br>
You should have yelled the same thing back to her “And dont you ever come home drunk again!”</p>

<p>Short term memory loss</p>

</aside>
<p>That is really subjective, I’m guessing some people experience it to varying degrees while others don’t at all. Regardless, presumably it is “short term”?<br>
[/quote]<br>
That really depends on the kind of weed. When I smoke amnesia, I do tend to have shitty short term memory, but anything other than that and I’m fine.</p>

<p>“Cannabis is not illegal because it is dangerous, but dangerous because it is illegal.”<br>
Again it’s subjective, some people will get bloodshot eyes from smoking, others do not. Personally, I would say it is significantly easier to act sober while stoned than while drunk.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Again, the bloodshot eyes depend on the kind of weed, but also how much you’ve smoked.<br>
If I smoke a little, I don’t get bloodshot eyes, but if I smoke a lot, I usually do.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I actually disagree with almost all of your points here.  Acting sober while drunk is very easy for me, while high it is extremely difficult.  Why?  I smoke very good weed.  VERY good weed.  And yes, while high my memory is totally shot, and lights become orange and distracting and I am unable to carry on even the shortest conversation because I forget what the conversation was even about in the middle of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Just wondering, have you ever been to the Netherlands? They say the weed here is generally pretty good.<br>
It does depend on the coffeeshop though, there’s one around here called Fly N Hy, which is really touristic and generally it sucks, but there’s two others, Majestic and De Baron, which sell really good weed. That’s usually where me and some friends get our weed. It’s generally better to ask the locals where to get the weed :P[/quote]No, but I’m Canadian so knowing the RIGHT people means I can get some really boom stuff.  I would LOVE to visit the Netherlands and I’ve heard great things not only about the weed but the general culture and people too!</p>
<p>I usually smoke exos, like Jack Flash, White Widow, AK, etc.  I even got my hands on real G13 one time.  Was the boomest, expensive as hell but damn was that thing COVERED in crystals.</p>

Short term memory loss<br>
[/quote]<br>
That is really subjective, I’m guessing some people experience it to varying degrees while others don’t at all. Regardless, presumably it is “short term”?[/quote]<br>
That really depends on the kind of weed. When I smoke amnesia, I do tend to have shitty short term memory, but anything other than that and I’m fine.</p>
<p>[quote=“Unhandled, post:31, topic:374952”]“Cannabis is not illegal because it is dangerous, but dangerous because it is illegal.”<br>
Again it’s subjective, some people will get bloodshot eyes from smoking, others do not. Personally, I would say it is significantly easier to act sober while stoned than while drunk.[/quote]<br>
Again, the bloodshot eyes depend on the kind of weed, but also how much you’ve smoked.<br>
If I smoke a little, I don’t get bloodshot eyes, but if I smoke a lot, I usually do.</p>

<p>I actually disagree with almost all of your points here.  Acting sober while drunk is very easy for me, while high it is extremely difficult.  Why?  I smoke very good weed.  VERY good weed.  And yes, while high my memory is totally shot, and lights become orange and distracting and I am unable to carry on even the shortest conversation because I forget what the conversation was even about in the middle of it.</p>

<p>Just wondering, have you ever been to the Netherlands? They say the weed here is generally pretty good.<br>
It does depend on the coffeeshop though, there’s one around here called Fly N Hy, which is really touristic and generally it sucks, but there’s two others, Majestic and De Baron, which sell really good weed. That’s usually where me and some friends get our weed. It’s generally better to ask the locals where to get the weed <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>“See dad the problem is…well…yea!”, is a usual scenario when I’m high.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, your statement on it being subjective is entirely true.  Although the potency of the drug plays a huge role, different people will be completely different in terms of reactions.</p>

<p>The hallucinogenic effects you have!</p>
<p>But on a serious note. I would prepare yourself to have a talk with her about the effects of weed. Lay down the facts. Explain to her thats a natural substance with few if any bad side effects.</p>

<p>Pulp Fiction reference aside, she’s overreacting if you’re an adult.<br>
If I was a parent and my son/daughter aged 14/15 etc was smoking weed, I’d be pretty pissed off about it. Come 17 and beyond though, it’d be their business – I’d tell them to be wary of any substances they induced, and to be safe about it.</p>
<p>My reason for this is that while there isn’t any real proof saying that weed can cause harm to an undeveloped brain (as Mopman kindly pointed out when we had this conversation on IRC), there isn’t any solid evidence to say that it doesn’t. So yeah, if I was a parent then I’d prefer that the kids wait until they’re a bit older.</p>
<p>tl;dr: If you’re an adult, 18+, then your mother’s reaction is ridiculous and overbearing.</p>
