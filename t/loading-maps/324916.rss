    <title>Loading Maps :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/loading-maps/324916</link>
    <description>I added the new Christmas costume to my client, compiled, then ran my client. My client was saying &quot;Loading maps 75%&quot; for at least 3 minutes, so I went back deleted the models, removed the costume from my class8.java, and just removed everything about it from the client and server, and it&#39;s still saying &quot;Loading maps 75%&quot;... No errors are coming up on the client of server run. So what could be causing this?... Please help.</description>
