    <title>317 Co Owner Crown Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-co-owner-crown-help/363856</link>
    <description>I have created a Player Rights &quot;4&quot; for owner and kept &quot;3&quot; for Co Owner.  I have changed many of the owner only commands to &quot;4&quot; and many of the owner commands are still &quot;3&quot; for Co Owner too.

My Problem- The Crown can be switched for either Owner or Co Owner through this code: 

          if (playerRights == 4) {
                out.write(2); // Crown fixup


            } else {
                out.write(playerRights); // mod level
            }
in &quot;if (playerRights == 4)&quot; that makes me the Owner have the crown.  If i switch it to if &quot;(playerRights == 3)&quot; the Co Owner gets crown instead of me.  


Main Question- How do I make it give me a crown for both Owner and Co Owner? Doing 
&quot;if (playerRights &gt;= 3) or any code that consolidates the crowns just crashes the client. 

Please Help!


Sincerely,


TheCyberMan
