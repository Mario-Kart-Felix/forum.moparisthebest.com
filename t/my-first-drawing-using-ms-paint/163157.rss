    <title>My First Drawing Using MS Paint</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-drawing-using-ms-paint/163157</link>
    <description>I say my first, it&#39;s my first semi-completed drawing.  I&#39;ve messed around on Paint before, but have never gotten this far.

Okay, what I&#39;ve done here is drawn a simple character outline (According to a picture of my account on RuneScape2), then gradually filled it in with different colours.  Originally, I wasn&#39;t confident and didn&#39;t want to mess up, so I spent around 20 hours on this, zooming in to specific body parts and using the smallest brush to fill in the area, varying my colours every so often to make the shading look decent.

This was my outcome:

I got into my mates house and we were playing Halo 3, eventually got bored as you do.  So I got that image and started working on it some more.  This was the result (I&#39;d spent around 2-3 hours on this believe it or not):

It&#39;s incomplete, and yes I do mean that if I were to complete the drawing, I&#39;d go over all of the parts that need to be re-shaded.  My methods were alot more varied doing this one, whereas the first time I was really carefull and used the undo tool God knows how many times..

Rate or whatever, I don&#39;t mind.  Just tell me what you think.  Unfortunate that it has to be revolved around RuneScape2 I know, I apologize for that.</description>

<p>Visit the graphics section on the RuneScape Community forums. They have tutorials for images like that.</p>

<p>Here he says he drew an outline according to his runescape character, whether he drew it looking at the image or physically traced image or not doesn’t matter, he used a premade image and copied it.</p>

<p>Exception, I don’t see where you have the right to come in here and begin arguing in a fight that has nothing to do with you. He did use a premade image, he took a picture of his account.</p>

<p>Actually, I wasn’t talking about the second one. I was talking about the first one (the one which took him 20 hours.), the one with the solid cyan background.</p>

<p>That has no gravity on the conversation at all you jack ass. He fucking traced a picture off of RuneScape. which already has a pretty large contour from character to background. He’s a kid, not a 20 year old professional game designer. Big deal Jagex made a character.</p>
<p>I never said no one could make images like that. I said he shouldn’t get the kind of praise he is getting for what little work he did.</p>

<p>Let me get home so I can trace a RuneScape picture. Honestly, when people physically draw something, like anime. People ask if you traced it or not, and you say “Oh, yeah, I did.” Then they make fun of you. Or just brush off what you drew as just a sheet of paper. Useless, now when a person traces a fricken picture, and uses a paint bucket. They get praise, it’s ridiculous.</p>
