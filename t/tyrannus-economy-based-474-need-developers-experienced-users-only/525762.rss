    <title>Tyrannus - Economy based 474 (Need Developers, Experienced Users Only)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tyrannus-economy-based-474-need-developers-experienced-users-only/525762</link>
    <description>[center]Hi there, 
My name is Devin, or, [i]Tyrannus[/i].
I am an Undergraduate Computer Science Major, specializing in Generalized programming.
I have 3 years University level training in C#, Java, PhP, Python, MySQL, and Perl.
Before going off to college, I had several years experience in Programming RSPS, on these forums, under a different Alias. Our server was quite successful. 
And now I am returning to the community to start a serious project that I hope will go far.[/center]




I am looking to start an Emulation project using the 474 revision, loading a higher cache (Not sure what revision yet). I intend to go the distance on this project, and am looking for people who are committed, experienced, and willing to follow direction.
Obviously looking for users on this forum with only similar experience and training would be quite extreme, however, I do have a few required Specifications if you intend to work on this project.


[b]Experience Requirements:[/b]

[ul][li]Minimum 2 Years Programming Experience (Varies depending on job duties, [e.g. Web developer will require 2 Years Web Development Experience])[/li]
[li]Ability to work at a mature level, on a serious project, with a serious goal. I will not tolerate immature behavior.[/li]
[li]Must have Flexible availability through-out the week.[/li][/ul]




I will be paying the full service fee of getting the server started. Including purchasing a Dedicated Server to host our Website and Server from.
I will be handling all Financial Aspects of getting us online, and getting us presentable, professional forums.

We will not be going Live until after our Development stage is completed (Estimated 2-3 weeks time before Beta Server Launch)




I will be hiring for 5 Positions, please feel free to send me a Personal Message with any additional reasons, beyond the application format, why you think you want to work on this project.
