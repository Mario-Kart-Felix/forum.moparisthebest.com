    <title>Multi-threaded projectileHandler</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multi-threaded-projectilehandler/72693</link>
    <description>Alright, I created a new class, called projectileHandler, and it controls all magical projectiles shot. Now it is seperate from other threads, so it has its own timer. Unfortunately, When I cast some spells, they perfectly make a trail to the target, but sometimes the client gets the wrong buffer and says there are too many players. I tried syncronizing everything in Stream.java, and the same fate happens. I&#39;m not sure what is happening. Here is some code.



Client.java in parseincomingpackets(). Creates a new projectile(NPC target).
[code]Runnable projectile = new projectileHandler(&quot;Wind&quot;, &quot;strike&quot;, absX, absY, playerIndexx, false);
                        Thread t = new Thread(projectile);
                        t.start();[/code]



gfx fire in projectileHandler
[code]for(int i = 0; i &lt; PlayerHandler.maxPlayers; i++) {
        if(PlayerHandler.players[i] != null) {
    Client p = (Client) PlayerHandler.players[i];
    if(p.distanceToPoint(casterX, casterY) &lt;= 60)
{
    //Casts Spell In Hands
        p.stillgfx2(castID, casterY, casterX, 0);
    //Fires Projectile
        p.createProjectile(casterY, casterX, offsetY, offsetX, angle, speed, movegfxID, startHeight, endHeight, Lockon, isNpc);
    //Finishes Spell
        p.stillgfx2(finishID, enemyY, enemyX, speed);
    }
        }
    }[/code]

The projectile thread destroys itself after it has done what it was supposed to. The part it screws up at is in the gfx firing. The Client gets the wrong buffers (I guess because its multithreaded), but I do not want to scrap my multithread idea. What should I do?</description>
