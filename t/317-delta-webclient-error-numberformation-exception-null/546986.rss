    <title>317 Delta Webclient error - NumberFormation Exception, null</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-webclient-error-numberformation-exception-null/546986</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m fairly new to RSPSing and recently I had downloaded a mostly blank delta client &amp; server to get me started. I wanted to get some experience with making a webclient for the future, so I created a few webpages quickly (the main page, download page, and webclient page; the other non-webclient pages are obviously irrelevant, but I just wanted to state what I have in the other folders) and I watched a youtube video on how to package the files in a .jar as well as sign them.

However, after doing so, I&#39;d often get one of three errors:
First, there was an error with client.class and other referenced  classes, so I placed those resources in the accompanying folder and had not gotten an error for that after I had did that.

Secondly, a permissions and name error; I googled the problem and so edited my manifest template to look as such:

[code]Main-Class: client
Permissions: all-permissions
Application-Name: ScavengeScape[/code]

I had no errors of the same kind after that.

Thirdly, and this is the main problem I am having at the moment, I now get this error:

I will either get this in console:

[code]Java Plug-in 10.67.2.01
Using JRE version 1.7.0_67-b01 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
User home directory = C:\Users\(myaccount)
----------------------------------------------------
c:   clear console window
f:   finalize objects on finalization queue
g:   garbage collect
h:   display this help message
l:   dump classloader list
m:   print memory usage
o:   trigger logging
q:   hide console
r:   reload policy configuration
s:   dump system and deployment properties
t:   dump thread list
v:   dump thread stack
x:   clear classloader cache
0-5: set trace level to &lt;n&gt;
----------------------------------------------------
0[/code]

or this:

[code]Java Plug-in 10.67.2.01
Using JRE version 1.7.0_67-b01 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
User home directory = C:\Users\(myaccount)
----------------------------------------------------
c:   clear console window
f:   finalize objects on finalization queue
g:   garbage collect
h:   display this help message

q:   hide console
r:   reload policy configuration
s:   dump system and deployment properties
t:   dump thread list
v:   dump thread stack
x:   clear classloader cache
0-5: set trace level to &lt;n&gt;
----------------------------------------------------[/code]

Which absolutely tells me nothing.  :palm:

Thinking it was a referencing error in the HTML code (even though it shouldn&#39;t be; the correct application name shows when I try to run it,) I tried several different addresses:

Directly referencing from within the folder:
[spoiler]&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;ScavengeScape Webclient&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;PRAGMA&quot; CONTENT=&quot;NO-CACHE&quot;&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
 
&lt;BODY background=&quot;C:\Users\(myaccount)\Desktop\scavengescapehtml\bg.jpg&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p align=&quot;Center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;C:\Users\(myaccount)\Desktop\scavengescapehtml\scavengescapemainpage.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;C:\Users\(myaccount)\Desktop\scavengescapehtml\scavengescapelogo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Back to main page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;marquee behavior=&quot;scroll&quot; direction=&quot;left&quot;&gt;///Scavengescape News/// Website created (9/27/14) - Client and server in development (9/28/14)&lt;/marquee&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;applet name=&quot;ScavengeScape Webclient&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; height=&quot;503&quot; archive=&quot;demorpg.jar&quot; code=&quot;client.class&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;param name=&quot;java_arguments&quot; value=&quot;-Xmx1024m&quot;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;[/spoiler]

Referencing its direct filepath:
[spoiler]&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;ScavengeScape Webclient&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;PRAGMA&quot; CONTENT=&quot;NO-CACHE&quot;&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
 
&lt;BODY background=&quot;C:\Users\(myaccount)\Desktop\scavengescapehtml\bg.jpg&quot;&gt;
 &lt;p align=&quot;Center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;C:\Users\(myaccount)\Desktop\scavengescapehtml\scavengescapemainpage.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;C:\Users\(myaccount)\Desktop\scavengescapehtml\scavengescapelogo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Back to main page&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;&lt;marquee behavior=&quot;scroll&quot; direction=&quot;left&quot;&gt;///Scavengescape News/// Website created (9/27/14) - Client and server in development (9/28/14)&lt;/marquee&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;applet name=&quot;ScavengeScape Webclient&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; height=&quot;503&quot; archive=&quot;file:///C:/Users/(myaccount)/Desktop/scavengescapehtml/clientresources/demorpg.jar&quot; code=&quot;client.class&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;param name=&quot;java_arguments&quot; value=&quot;-Xmx1024m&quot;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;[/spoiler]

I&#39;ve also tried a dropbox link which returned a bad link error and once fixed it provided the same error the other two have.

Also, I&#39;ve been told to change my security exception and security in general to exclude my website/make my security level medium, both of which did not work. I&#39;ve tried installing and signing with the latest version of JDK.

I have not messed with system elements in a while nor have I compiled the client with the latest version of JDK, some things I will do soon, and will update you if they work or fail.

Thanks mates.

Update 1:

Compiling and signing with the newest JDK did not work, however I feel this may be important:

If there is anything wrong there, please notify me. The .jar should be hosted in the folder, but you may see something I do not.
Also, after I accept and run everything, the same problem occurs.</description>
