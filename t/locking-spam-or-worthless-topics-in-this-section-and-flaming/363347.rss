    <title>Locking Spam or Worthless Topics (In this Section) and Flaming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/locking-spam-or-worthless-topics-in-this-section-and-flaming/363347</link>
    <description>So I was thinking... is there really a point to locking or deleting useless topics? Does a post count REALLY matter on this forum? Clearly it does, or else those useless topics would stay alive. The only logical reason to delete a useless topic is to prevent actual discussion ones from being visible, but if they were worth talking about and still active they wouldn&#39;t be on the brink of page 2 in the first place.

I think the only reason &quot;No Spam or Flame&quot; are the first rules on every forum is because EVERY other forum has it, so owners would think it&#39;s a necessity. Was Davidi2&#39;s dog dieing topic really worth locking, you terrible mod Silabsoft? (Oh no I broke a rule and directly attacked another member! If this was the real world, I wouldn&#39;t get locked up for expressing my opinion in public. I and a ton of other people get flamed all the time and nobody does crap) What harm could it possibly cause to keep it open and let others post their opinions, or just troll? If he really cared about being trolled or made fun of, he wouldn&#39;t have posted it in the first place. Whether or not a user wants something to be discussed should be up to them and not those &quot;in control&quot;.

If the point of deleting these topics is to keep the forum civilized and an actual place for discussion, well then we&#39;re heading in the wrong direction. No matter what, people are going to flame. If you want to stop topics that create flame wars, then you&#39;re going to have to get rid of every member potential of creating one.

Obviously nobody has thought of the spam and flaming rule thoroughly, but just felt like creating one more rule because they can. If they did, they would see how pointless it is and that it truly shows that post count matters, forum space is vital, and everybody should take flaming seriously. Remember, this is the internet, and flaming doesn&#39;t actually matter. Eventually everyone will see that people like abraham2119 can only seek fun in a manner that involves mentally damaging another, and their ignorance will drive them away.

Before I go on and on and on, I want to bring up one more point. General discussion is spam overall. It doesn&#39;t help production or serve a point, so why do we have this board? Why are we only limited to discussing what those with authority think is worth discussing? This forum makes me sick. A lot of things haven&#39;t been thought through, and those smart enough to bring these things up are ignored and the awfulness of this community continues.

I agree to a point, but I think if the topic is really worthless and has NO propose at all. Like a good bye thread or whatever, then it should get deleted/locked.[/quote]I think Lin agrees that those are common sense pointless.</p>
<p>But I totally agree with this. Also, a lot of random threads like ‘post your picture’ ‘what are you listening too’ ‘post your favorite song’ are all alive and going well, but my picture thread was locked immediately, with the mod saying ‘go back to /b/’[/quote]</p>

<p>The name of the thread was “<a href="http://Fuking.net">Fuking.net</a> images”  the site is <a href="http://fukung.net">fukung.net</a>.  Even your link has it as <a href="http://fukung.net">fukung.net</a>.  We don’t allow any other threads like yours to be posted.  The closest that I know of is the “Post your picture” thread, which is all people posting pictures of themselves.  Not horribly retarded pictures from 4chan.[/quote]FC had said ‘<a href="http://fuckung.net">fuckung.net</a>’</p>
<p>Also, why don’t you allow them to be posted? It’s general discussion, and images are obviously allowed:<br>
From the rules:<br>
No extremely grotesque images<br>
No pornography please</p>
<p>So if images weren’t allowed, why not just say ‘no image threads’, instead of making rules for images.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>[quote=“Lin, post:1, topic:363347”]So I was thinking… is there really a point to locking or deleting useless topics? Does a post count REALLY matter on this forum? Clearly it does, or else those useless topics would stay alive. The only logical reason to delete a useless topic is to prevent actual discussion ones from being visible, but if they were worth talking about and still active they wouldn’t be on the brink of page 2 in the first place.</p>
<p>I think the only reason “No Spam or Flame” are the first rules on every forum is because EVERY other forum has it, so owners would think it’s a necessity. Was Davidi2’s dog dieing topic really worth locking, you terrible mod Silabsoft? (Oh no I broke a rule and directly attacked another member! If this was the real world, I wouldn’t get locked up for expressing my opinion in public. I and a ton of other people get flamed all the time and nobody does crap) What harm could it possibly cause to keep it open and let others post their opinions, or just troll? If he really cared about being trolled or made fun of, he wouldn’t have posted it in the first place. Whether or not a user wants something to be discussed should be up to them and not those “in control”.</p>
<p>If the point of deleting these topics is to keep the forum civilized and an actual place for discussion, well then we’re heading in the wrong direction. No matter what, people are going to flame. If you want to stop topics that create flame wars, then you’re going to have to get rid of every member potential of creating one.</p>
<p>Obviously nobody has thought of the spam and flaming rule thoroughly, but just felt like creating one more rule because they can. If they did, they would see how pointless it is and that it truly shows that post count matters, forum space is vital, and everybody should take flaming seriously. Remember, this is the internet, and flaming doesn’t actually matter. Eventually everyone will see that people like abraham2119 can only seek fun in a manner that involves mentally damaging another, and their ignorance will drive them away.</p>
<p>Before I go on and on and on, I want to bring up one more point. General discussion is spam overall. It doesn’t help production or serve a point, so why do we have this board? Why are we only limited to discussing what those with authority think is worth discussing? This forum makes me sick. A lot of things haven’t been thought through, and those smart enough to bring these things up are ignored and the awfulness of this community continues.</p>
<p>~Lin[/quote]<br>
I agree with you 100 fucking percent</p>

If anything Silab helped him, because people were bound to troll the topic eventually.
<p>This has never been a support forum either, and shouldn’t be. What the hell are all year 13 year old members going to do?</p>
<p>Simply put, whine more lin.</p>

              <p>Im new here so I don’t know much of what goes on. But my experience with other forums tells me that flaming/hating is the way of the internet life.<br>
There will always be people whose purpose is simply to just rage/hate, but I suppose that is fine, because at the end of the day it doesn’t make much different to the thread owner, everyone has their own opinion.</p>
<p>As for the general discussion board, I sorta disagree because it breaks the whole monotony of RSPS - its like taking a break from all that gibberish talk (I’m a noob), and if it is general discussion then I guess anything should go - whatever the topic be.</p>
<p>Obviously after my response and several others yet to come there will be people that will flame, hate etc. Instead of locking the topic if you just ignore them it does the same purpose, flamers/haters only want attention.</p>
<p>This is my opinion and you may/may not agree <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>But I totally agree with this. Also, a lot of random threads like ‘post your picture’ ‘what are you listening too’ ‘post your favorite song’ are all alive and going well, but my picture thread was locked immediately, with the mod saying ‘go back to /b/’</p>

              <p>So I was thinking… is there really a point to locking or deleting useless topics? Does a post count REALLY matter on this forum? Clearly it does, or else those useless topics would stay alive. The only logical reason to delete a useless topic is to prevent actual discussion ones from being visible, but if they were worth talking about and still active they wouldn’t be on the brink of page 2 in the first place.</p>
<p>I think the only reason “No Spam or Flame” are the first rules on every forum is because EVERY other forum has it, so owners would think it’s a necessity. Was Davidi2’s dog dieing topic really worth locking, you terrible mod Silabsoft? (Oh no I broke a rule and directly attacked another member! If this was the real world, I wouldn’t get locked up for expressing my opinion in public. I and a ton of other people get flamed all the time and nobody does crap) What harm could it possibly cause to keep it open and let others post their opinions, or just troll? If he really cared about being trolled or made fun of, he wouldn’t have posted it in the first place. Whether or not a user wants something to be discussed should be up to them and not those “in control”.</p>
<p>If the point of deleting these topics is to keep the forum civilized and an actual place for discussion, well then we’re heading in the wrong direction. No matter what, people are going to flame. If you want to stop topics that create flame wars, then you’re going to have to get rid of every member potential of creating one.</p>
<p>Obviously nobody has thought of the spam and flaming rule thoroughly, but just felt like creating one more rule because they can. If they did, they would see how pointless it is and that it truly shows that post count matters, forum space is vital, and everybody should take flaming seriously. Remember, this is the internet, and flaming doesn’t actually matter. Eventually everyone will see that people like abraham2119 can only seek fun in a manner that involves mentally damaging another, and their ignorance will drive them away.</p>
<p>Before I go on and on and on, I want to bring up one more point. General discussion is spam overall. It doesn’t help production or serve a point, so why do we have this board? Why are we only limited to discussing what those with authority think is worth discussing? This forum makes me sick. A lot of things haven’t been thought through, and those smart enough to bring these things up are ignored and the awfulness of this community continues.</p>
