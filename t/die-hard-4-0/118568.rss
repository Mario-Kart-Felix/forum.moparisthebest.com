    <description>Die Hard 4.0

This movie was by far, the sickest in the last 5 years! It had a very nice story which had to do with a group of hackers who end up taking over all the computer related utilities such the Internet, television, cell phones, traffic lights, and everything else you can imagine. 

John McClain is back as a super hero indestructable cop working for the (I think) NYPD (I forget, I might be wrong) in this riveting movie. In the beginning, he has to just pick up some ordinary kid and bring him to the cops on computer related charges. Little did he know that some very malicious team of security fanatics were taking down all their  competition, top hackers, in order to take over the U.S. computers without a threat. 

I don&#39;t want to spoil the rest for you, so go and watch the movie in the [b]theater[/b]. Don&#39;t download it from a gay torrent because you will lose the effect of the movie. Action movies supply a much higher magnitude of entertainment when watched in a theater instead of a dinky 18&quot; laptop. 

I saw it here in India and it was just perfect! Of course, it was a corny movie, but if you ignore the small mistakes here and there and get by the indestructable hero, then it can be loads of fun!

              <p>Oh yes this was quite a good film. I mean I have to say one of the best parts was when they were chased into the underground way by the helicopters. Unrealistic, but entertaining. Oh and another film to add onto the unrealistic entertaining movies. Transformers.</p>

              <p>Eh, any movie is unrealistic. Have you ever seen Rambo? lol that was a fun movie but man if I wanted to sit and make fun of it, I could do it all day lol.</p>
<p>Same with Rocky. I could make fun of that for the next year, but it was still entertaining. Also take any fiction or fantasy movie. Those are made to be unrealistic, but people still enjoy. A recent example would be Harry Potter. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So if you see anything unrealistic to an extreme point, just take your eyes of the screen and say to yourself that it’s a movie. It’s not supposed to be real. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> No one would want to see a movie on some guy who went to work at a factory for 7 hours and then come back watch TV and go to sleep. That’s realistic, but very boring.</p>
<p>I do agree that I did see many unrealistic things in that movie, like why the cops showed up at the very end… lol, but like I said before, I could pick at it all day, but then I wouldn’t enjoy it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>To be honest it’s my favorite movie now. I watched it yesterday (except here it’s called Live Free or Die Hard) at the theater. My friend and I weren’t going to, we got caught going to a different movie then we got a ticket for something else in the first theater (A setback, we hadn’t been caught in the 20 other times we’d done stuff were not supposed to do there)… So we got kicked out, we went to a different theater (better anyhow). The effects were very cool. It seemed real. Couldn’t go through 2 minutes without someone dying, a shoot out, or a big explosion <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>When they’re driving it looks real too.
