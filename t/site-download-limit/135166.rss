    <title>Site Download limit :/</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/site-download-limit/135166</link>
    <description>Ok i have a question,

is there a way to bypass a download limit that is based off of a account other than an ip address. i was wondering because this would save me 6$ a month lol, if you want a look at the site im talking about refer to [url=http://www.animenuke.com]here[/url]

thanks for your help =)

P.s. is there a way to trick a tracker into thinking your upload ratio is higher then it is? Like torrent wise.</description>
