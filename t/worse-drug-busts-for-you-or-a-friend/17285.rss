e and my other 2 friends, were go to the topsfield fair. One of my friends wanted to sneak in so we said ok and i am really good at sneaking in, but my freindd wanted to sneak in formthe main entrance. MY friend who didnt have money fell behind from talking on his cell, thenit happen to him the police caught him. Me and my other friend were about 70 yards away from my firiend who got caught and we were going to walk out since there wasnt a way to get in. Then are friend who got caught ratted us out and then pointed us out to the pice and they cam chargin over and got us. I tried using my famous exucse that usally works is that i wnet to go get money from  my moms car, they didnt buy it and they wanted to see my moms car. I tried to play stupid and i said i dont know what kind of she has lol. Then we were there for about a hour trying to get out of the mess. Then my friend who got cuahgt ratted us even mnore and said that we snuck in on firday last week and  we did but didnt get caught but he got caught trying to sneak in last weeek, too. Me and my friend denied it of course. They took are names street adress and phone number and what town we lived in. Then the cops asked us if we had any drugs. My friend who got caught first had about 5 grams of weed on him and keeps it in a baggy in 2 clean socks, but before we went my other friend threw his socks away so it was just in the baggy. Of course my friend said he didnt have any drugs on him. So they mad ehim empty out his pockets and he keep the 5 grams of weed in his pocke thinmking he was safe. Then the cop felt him and found the bag and luaghed and said it hought you didnt have any drugs this keeps getting better and better. They handcuffed him and then they searched my friend but before they did he kept on saying i want a warrent please, for about 3 minsutes before they searched him. The cops luahged at him saying we dont need a warrent to search you so they made him empty out his pockets he kept his chilum in trhe pocket. Then the cop felt him to see if he kept naything in his pocekts the cop pushes up the chilum about half way and  then pushes it back down. I think they wree doing my friend a favor on that. Then they searched me but all i had was cash and a cell phone. Me and my friend with the chilum got to leave, since he we didnt have any drugs.  The next day my friend who got caught had to go to court and he got 6 months of probation and 20 hours of community service and teh funny part is my friend gets off punishment on monday and gets to go to the fair</description>

              <p>I was in my bath room smoking cigarretes one time, and then my mom knocked on the door and said open up. I put the cigarrete in the toilet and opened up the bathroom door. I don’t really know what she was thinking at that moment, but I think she saw the smoke and probably smelled it in my hair…I dont really think she cared to much, she just told me it was stupid and to stop…I guess tobacco really isnt THAT bad even though its not good for you, but I haven’t dont a major drug before.</p>
