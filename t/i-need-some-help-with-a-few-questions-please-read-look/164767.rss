    <description>Hi! my first question is when i wear certain items like a necklace it goes to the weapon slot so now i cant use a weapon. How do i make it work?

My second question is how to add silabs items and stuff i got the the client but it wont open, I just need to know everything im supposed to do and have and edit. I just barely found out that they got new items and need help adding them. Remember I just barely found out about the items
!

My third question is how to make gates and doors work. They don&#39;t work.

You can answer all or any of my questions just help me please!
I know your thinking im a noob and stuff, but just help please!!
