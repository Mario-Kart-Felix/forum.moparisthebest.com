    <title>Matrix 718</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/matrix-718/523947</link>
    <description>Having problems with a few things, greatly appreciated if someone could help me out.

#1) my current run.bat is:
@echo off
title Server 
&quot;C:/Program Files/Java/jre7/bin/java.exe&quot; -Xmx512m -cp bin;lib/*; com.rs.Launcher true true false
pause
-
But considering I have a linux server, I need to convert it so it works with linux, I checked a few tutorials and it just confused me. Anyone can clear it up for me, greatly appreciated.

#2: How to make an account creation name restriction, so it would block the names with like &quot;mod&quot; and &quot;owner&quot; so example people could create the name of &quot;mod matrix&quot; or &quot;owner matrix&quot;. But if the account has already been created it will still allow you to login. Just not to create new account names with those words.

#3. How to fully restrict all admin ranks except for certain names to not be able to:
Cannot Trade
Sell to Shops
Drop Items (if so, it disappears right away)
Dismiss Summoning Creatures to allow admins to drop.
Staking
Pking (says like admins cannot be attacked)
When they die, keep items on death
-
And any other ways admins could find a way to trade to mess up the economy.

Thanks greatly appreciated.</description>
