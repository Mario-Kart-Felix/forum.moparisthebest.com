    <description>So i want to work offline with matrix (localhost)

So i went to loader.java and changed all Ips to 127.0.0.1

But this is there too, i didnt changed it yet, but i think its good to post it.

[code]public static final int LOBBY_PORT = 41116;[/code]

He still stays at 0%, source 0 errors and runned, client 0 errors (14 warning) and runned.

How can i make it start</description>
