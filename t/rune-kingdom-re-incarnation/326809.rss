    <title>Rune-Kingdom; Re-Incarnation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rune-kingdom-re-incarnation/326809</link>
    <description>Hello, and welcome to my thread, This thread is for the development of a server created originally by the MoparScape user, [b]Skype™[/b]. With his permission I&#39;ve decided to download the source fix the multiple bugs it has in it, add more features and basically face lift it to where the stability isn&#39;t such a huge factor. Then, finally when finished I&#39;ll release back onto this website with the credits all going to him. So now, onto the progress.

[b][i]Known Bugs:[/i][/b]
1. Login IP-Ban: Fixed
2. Duel-Arena Duping: Fixed
3. Trading Dupe: Fixed
4. 2 Hander Shield Glitch: Fixed
5. Slayer Dupe: Fixed
6. There was more but the were not as significant as these other ones.

[b][i]Updates[/i][/b]
1. Moved home to Entrana
2. Made 3 new quests that are hard but give XP to certain skills and unlock new areas.
3. Edited bonuses and lowered XP rate to make the server more of an economy
4. Removed most of the good items from the Shop to increase economy.
5. Made GodSword smithing for 90+ smithers instead of bosses dropping full GodSwords.
6. Created better GodWars with Custom NPC&#39;s to fight to enter the dungeons.
7. Edited Fight Pits whereas the winner gets GP depending on the amount of players in the pit.
8. More to come just started this project 3 days ago.

Pictures [u][i][b]WILL[/b][/i][/u] be coming soon, I just need to get on my Desktop because my Laptop (which i&#39;m using now) is slow as hell.
