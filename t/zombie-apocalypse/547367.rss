<p>I know, it isn’t im talking about city people and rednecks, theres allot of smart athletic people but all my friends think the rednecks will out live the city people, so i decided to make a topic and “Rednecks” and “City People”</p>
<p>So i made a topic here for all of you to decide who will live longer, not that it matters tho </p><blockquote>Zombie apocalypse isn’t ever coming</blockquote> but its just something for fun

this topic is not to offend anyone if you get offended from this why df did you read and/or click on it and if you are offended dont comment<br>

<p>had to read 3 times to clarify what you were saying, use a comma next time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>It actually depends. City folks may have access to more guns, but rednecks are just crazy, they don’t give a single decimal of a shit if they get dirty. It’s a 50/50 tbh.</p>
<p>next time i will use a comma, and i know i live right in the middle of redneck world xD allot of my friends are rednecks DUCTAPE solves everything[/quote]</p>
