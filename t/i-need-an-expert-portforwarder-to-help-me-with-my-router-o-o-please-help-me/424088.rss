    <title>I need an expert portforwarder to help me with my router. O.o Please. Help. Me</title>

    <description>I have RoadRunner internet by Time Warner Cable, I access my gateway settings by typing my IP address into my address bar. I allow the port to be opened.

I created an exception in my firewall. 

And when I go to check if the port is open, I still get this.

I was able to access my server locally with 127.0.0.1 last night but I cannot now, I don&#39;t know why. Any help with either issue is appreciated. Thank you, Dylan


EDIT: I found out why I couldn&#39;t log on on my server offline but I still need help portforwarding my router. :s</description>
