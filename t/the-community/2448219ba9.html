<p>Kait’s was different. WAY different.<br>
Back then, cheating wasn’t really for the masses, kait’s had what, perhaps 2-5k members, whereas this board has 250k members.<br>
The community “feeling” has gone away due to macroing becoming widespread (and perhaps also private servers), which imo is the cause for the sorry state of RS cheating.<br>

Kaitnieks reached 40k in members.[/quote]<br>
Wasn’t that around the time of aryan/rsps?<br>

        <p>[quote=“Tree, post:1, topic:244821”]<span class="bbcode-u">@ Elitism</span></p>
<p>This has been a problem for a number of years now. Since majority of the members are halfwits, it’s only natural for elitism to breed. There isn’t a cure so we should stop looking for one.[/quote]<br>
There is always a way to fix this problem, or at the very least, decrease the amount of it occurring and/or stopping the spread of it. Of course, it all depends on what you mean by the term elitism, as there are multiple meanings which differ from one person to the next. The thing is, nobody is trying to change it, because <span class="bbcode-s">they want it like that</span> <span class="bbcode-b">anybody who’s opinion matters is listened to and all others are ignored.</span></p>
<p>The defending of an individual because he/she is a friend when in all honesty he/she commited an illicit act is terrible. It’s happened a few times in the past, with staff members too. I know this is not too much of a serious problem, but it builds up after a while and forces the idea that it is okay to do such things in the future (not just for the wrong-doer, but for the community as a whole). Staff members who participate in such acts, in my opinion, should be severely punished. Permanent/temporary demotion or even a temporary ban. This may sound harsh, but staff members should not be doing these types of things in the first place, and deserve 100% of the punishment due to their foolishness.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s my reasoning: Because elitism in general is not against the rules and general acts corresponding with elitism in general are allowed, it is hard to prevent events with any sort of relation from occurring. Most of the staff (if not all with the exception of a few moparscape moderators) are so-called elitists themselves and fall in with the elitist crowd, and honestly dont care about it happening. I’m not going to go into much further detail on the aforementioned matter, instead, I’ll skip straight to a recently very controversial topic: Greeny.</p>
<p>Many say he does his job just fine, which is true if you think about just the job itself, but there are things that go with. For example, <span class="bbcode-i">how</span> you do the job is a big factor. I’ve seen him lock topics with messages like “lokd” rather than explanations for the lock, and without a hint that could help the poster him/herself from doing it again. Hatred against specific individuals in the community is not a real pro to your argument either. I’m not saying I have anything against Greeny, but things can be improved just like everybody else.</p>
<blockquote>@ Staff Changes
<p>The head chief has been inactive for a fair while. This isn’t his fault but it is leading the the community getting worse and worse. To make up for his activity, he as promoted Lothy and Niall to look after the community and keep everything in order. These two members are responsible for looking after a community that they don’t own or benefit from.</p>
<p>For some reason, many of our members choose to ignore these facts. I’m fully aware that they do a horrible job at times. Though, anyone with that position would get criticised because of the sheer amount of elitism that lurks these boards.</p>
</blockquote><br>
I completely agree with you here. They fulfill their role as administrators on a forum that, in return, they gain nothing from. People criticizing Niall and Lothy are not thinking about what they’ve done for the community, and are only considering options available that benefit them in one way or another (e.g. fitting in with the crowd).
<blockquote>@ The New MSCP Mods
<p>These new staff members are simply there for the manpower. Their role is equivalent to Jason’s. They are not required to be thinkers. The admins are also not to be blamed for these staff selections. Every staff member has had the opportunity to object to these solutions before the promotions took place. There was very little opposition.</p>
</blockquote><br>
This is not a way to think of our staff members that actually do work on the site they are intended to do work on when you do none of it yourself. I suggest stopping the hypocrisy on this matter, because if I recall correctly, you did not shout-out and try to prevent these promotions from occuring. That might not be your point, as I am just pointing a finger at you due to my assumption, but this goes for the rest of the staff. Complaining about what they do is not right, rather, why not try to help them out? Nobody is perfect, and if you are more experienced in the field they are trying to succeed in, why not help them out? You were in that position too, so acting all high and mighty would be a foolish thing to do.

<p>Here’s your problem.  You’re trying to remodel perfection, which obviously isn’t going to occur.  How about we shoot for an acceptable level, and not a superior level?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is true. Many of us are complaining the forum is going downhill and the only reason we’re here is because IRC, to flame, etc. If you think so, you can just fuck off and leave right now. If not, we can assist you in that matter. If you honestly dont care for the community just go ahead and save yourself your time and your life: leave. Or at the very least, don’t contribute to the discussion going on that does not concern you nor if do you not concern it. You are the problem in the community.</p>
<p>Bottom line: attempts have taken place, but once the going got tough, people gave up. We need stick to our plan, and continue with it full-on. Especially staff, as we have a large influence on what goes and what doesn’t. If we combine our efforts and if we do not stop trying, we can accomplish what we are aiming for: a greater community.</p>

        <p>The fact of the matter is, elitism is the root strangling this community at the cores. Elitism, in my definition, is the growing cause of wanting to be better than all others in a group of people and are thus treated as so. As a result of elitism, all none-elite members are treated like trash, terribly thwarting any chances of them to grow in their knowledge and understanding. Talking like this seems to make me almost non-arrogant, but those of you who have been here when I was a mod myself know otherwise. I do not claim to be not-arrogant, but that does not, under any reason, seclude me from the ability to point out how wrong and selfish arrogance is. It does not seclude me from being to also point out how much arrogance has grown and is growing on this forum either. Do you not realize that every member on this forum is full of themselves? Those who are prideful and boastful about it won’t even understand what I am saying here because they will be blind and hardened against the idea of improvement. I don’t really care how they feel, because the they are the minority for once. Any normal-minded person reading this post will truly realize that this forum is full of utter <span class="bbcode-u">shit</span>.</p>
<p>Improvement? Haha, you must be joking. <span class="bbcode-b">No</span>, improvement is very possible. This community needs to get off of their own balls and realize that everyone is talented, that everyone is good at something. One thing I have noticed ever since I quit from being apart of the staff here is that every single person who has ever lived as done simply that- they LIVED. Everyone alive right now will be alive for every second just like everyone else. During every second, every person is learning based on what their senses are inputing to their brain. Each person is always in a different environment at every second than someone else, thus everyone is <span class="bbcode-b">always learning something different</span>. How unique can you get? People are beyond unique. There is no such thing as normal and thinking of so makes you a fool. Every person has their own individual talents and their own gifts, so why should you judge them on their dreams or on their lesser talents? You, I, or anyone else on this forum is no better than each other. We each have our own gifts and our own brains and memories and that alone sets us apart in such a way that cannot possibly be weighed, despite what you can ever say or think.</p>
<p>So, how do we improve the community? After this community realizes that we are all different and it is impossible to truly judge someone for how talented they really are, then the community can be balanced in a way that equalizes the playing field of posting topics and sharing ideas. Then, when someone comes along thinking they are better than someone else, the community itself will shun them and they will realize how stupid they are being and will stop judging people.</p>
<p>However, despite the fact that this idea of improvement is relatively simple, it is not going to be happen. I am being pessimistic about this because I know it is impossible to bring about. One has to experience what life is like at the bottom, or near the bottom, as a result of their arrogance, in order to truly understand the points I have outlined. I am not saying I have experienced this myself, for I doubt I have, but I have tasted a bit of it and have really realized how fucking selfish I was when I was so arrogant (more than I am now) when I was a moderator.</p>
<p>Now, besides just sitting here talking about elitism, how to improve it, and it is actually impossible to improve, I also want to discuss moderatorship. I have been a moderator longer than most now can say, and earlier than most can say, though only on these forums. I have experienced the rantings and have felt what it is like to have an entire community of people literally rant in unison against a decision I have made. I feel the frustration in the current staff for how these topics are treating them, because no one has a fucking clue what something is like until they taste it themselves. Don’t think, for a single second, that you know something- you are only fooling yourself. Being apart of a staff of a community of nearly 5,000 active people, with over 200,000 made accounts is a very tough feat. You need to have a well organized work ethic and understand how to work well in tough situations. And, when you make a mistake, you better have some tough skin, because shit like <span class="bbcode-i">this</span> happens. People start thinking they know what the hell they are talking about when they are really restating what someone else has said and are sticking their head farther up their ass than one thinks is possible.</p>
<p>Now, I hate to have started this entire topic so well and end with such biasness, but I felt it was necessary. I have recently talked over with several people what they thought about the current issues going on and you would not believe some of the answers I have gotten. Just please, understand how difficult it is to try to give everyone what everyone wants and then be criticized and kicked repeatedly, once down, just for trying. And also, try to understand why elitism is causing all these problems and how it can only be changed one step at a time, with each and every one of us.</p>
<p>PS: I apologize for stating nearly 5 arguments throughout this small post and being very, very diverse and supporting no straight thesis, but again I felt it was necessary to vent everything I have to say, just as a start. Thanks for reading if you made it this far and please support or criticize this post- I encourage you to.</p>

Those who are prideful and boastful about it won’t even understand what I am saying here because they will be blind and hardened against the idea of improvement. I don’t really care how they feel, because the they are the minority for once. Any normal-minded person reading this post will truly realize that this forum is full of utter <span class="bbcode-u">shit</span>.</p>
<p>Improvement? Haha, you must be joking. <span class="bbcode-b">No</span>, improvement is very possible. This community needs to get off of their own balls and realize that everyone is talented, that everyone is good at something. One thing I have noticed ever since I quit from being apart of the staff here is that every single person who has ever lived as done simply that- they LIVED. Everyone alive right now will be alive for every second just like everyone else. During every second, every person is learning based on what their senses are inputing to their brain. Each person is always in a different environment at every second than someone else, thus everyone is <span class="bbcode-b">always learning something different</span>. How unique can you get? People are beyond unique. There is no such thing as normal and thinking of so makes you a fool. Every person has their own individual talents and their own gifts, so why should you judge them on their dreams or on their lesser talents? You, I, or anyone else on this forum is no better than each other. We each have our own gifts and our own brains and memories and that alone sets us apart in such a way that cannot possibly be weighed, despite what you can ever say or think.</p>
<p>So, how do we improve the community? After this community realizes that we are all different and it is impossible to truly judge someone for how talented they really are, then the community can be balanced in a way that equalizes the playing field of posting topics and sharing ideas. Then, when someone comes along thinking they are better than someone else, the community itself will shun them and they will realize how stupid they are being and will stop judging people.</p>
<p>However, despite the fact that this idea of improvement is relatively simple, it is not going to be happen. I am being pessimistic about this because I know it is impossible to bring about. One has to experience what life is like at the bottom, or near the bottom, as a result of their arrogance, in order to truly understand the points I have outlined. I am not saying I have experienced this myself, for I doubt I have, but I have tasted a bit of it and have really realized how fucking selfish I was when I was so arrogant (more than I am now) when I was a moderator.</p>
<p>Now, besides just sitting here talking about elitism, how to improve it, and it is actually impossible to improve, I also want to discuss moderatorship. I have been a moderator longer than most now can say, and earlier than most can say, though only on these forums. I have experienced the rantings and have felt what it is like to have an entire community of people literally rant in unison against a decision I have made. I feel the frustration in the current staff for how these topics are treating them, because no one has a fucking clue what something is like until they taste it themselves. Don’t think, for a single second, that you know something- you are only fooling yourself. Being apart of a staff of a community of nearly 5,000 active people, with over 200,000 made accounts is a very tough feat. You need to have a well organized work ethic and understand how to work well in tough situations. And, when you make a mistake, you better have some tough skin, because shit like <span class="bbcode-i">this</span> happens. People start thinking they know what the hell they are talking about when they are really restating what someone else has said and are sticking their head farther up their ass than one thinks is possible.</p>
<p>Now, I hate to have started this entire topic so well and end with such biasness, but I felt it was necessary. I have recently talked over with several people what they thought about the current issues going on and you would not believe some of the answers I have gotten. Just please, understand how difficult it is to try to give everyone what everyone wants and then be criticized and kicked repeatedly, once down, just for trying. And also, try to understand why elitism is causing all these problems and how it can only be changed one step at a time, with each and every one of us.</p>
<p>PS: I apologize for stating nearly 5 arguments throughout this small post and being very, very diverse and supporting no straight thesis, but again I felt it was necessary to vent everything I have to say, just as a start. Thanks for reading if you made it this far and please support or criticize this post- I encourage you to.[/quote]<br>

The fact of the matter is, elitism is the root strangling this community at the cores. Elitism, in my definition, is the growing cause of wanting to be better than all others in a group of people and are thus treated as so. As a result of elitism, all none-elite members are treated like trash, terribly thwarting any chances of them to grow in their knowledge and understanding. Talking like this seems to make me almost non-arrogant, but those of you who have been here when I was a mod myself know otherwise. I do not claim to be not-arrogant, but that does not, under any reason, seclude me from the ability to point out how wrong and selfish arrogance is. It does not seclude me from being to also point out how much arrogance has grown and is growing on this forum either. Do you not realize that every member on this forum is full of themselves?
