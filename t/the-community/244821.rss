    <description>Lately, there have been numerous threads which criticize the work of our staff members and the running of this community. However, no viable solutions have been presented. The new members in this community continuously fail to recognize the amount of attempts that have been made for improvement.

[u]@ Staff Changes[/u]

The head chief has been inactive for a fair while. This isn&#39;t his fault but it is leading the the community getting worse and worse. To make up for his activity, he as promoted Lothy and Niall to look after the community and keep everything in order. These two members are responsible for looking after a community that they don&#39;t own or benefit from. 

For some reason, many of our members choose to ignore these facts. I&#39;m fully aware that they do a horrible job at times. Though, anyone with that position would get criticised because of the sheer amount of elitism that lurks these boards.

[u]@ Greeny[/u]

I&#39;m personally tired of people having a go at this guy for the job he is doing. This valued member of the community has been helpful to anyone that has came to him. There have been multiple times where i have required his assistance in various tasks and he has came to my aid. This guy is the heart and soul of the community and partially the reason as to why i keep coming back here.

The whole time this moderator has been doing his job, he has been consistent. There isn&#39;t a sign of hypocrisy in this guy and his posts reflect this. He has also been open for debate against his character and i have never seen him back away from an argument. 

[u]@ The New MSCP Mods[/u]

These new staff members are simply there for the manpower. Their role is equivalent to Jason&#39;s. They are not required to be thinkers. The admins are also not to be blamed for these staff selections. Every staff member has had the opportunity to object to these solutions before the promotions took place. There was very little opposition.

[u]@ Elitism[/u]

This has been a problem for a number of years now. Since majority of the members are halfwits, it&#39;s only natural for elitism to breed. There isn&#39;t a cure so we should stop looking for one.
[hr]

There isn&#39;t much more to say. I just wanted to cover a few subjects that have been neglected in the past. These are my opinions, not the staffs. Keep that in note.

NOTE: The paragraph&#39;s on Greeny are not in response to Squig&#39;s thread. There have been many previous threads on him.</description>

<p>Kait’s was different. WAY different.<br>
Back then, cheating wasn’t really for the masses, kait’s had what, perhaps 2-5k members, whereas this board has 250k members.<br>
The community “feeling” has gone away due to macroing becoming widespread (and perhaps also private servers), which imo is the cause for the sorry state of RS cheating.</p>

Wasn’t that around the time of aryan/rsps?<br>
I remember a time where kait’s was like 2-5k members…[/quote]</p>
<p>Kait was best when it was around 2-5k members :(…and people were learning and posting stuff in the community hacking tips…a section that completley died when aryan came out. =(</p>

The factor of elitism can be blamed by the moderators, to a certain extent.  To the other extent, it may also be blamed on those who bring the elitist comments among themselves, and just generally people in the community.  It is partially at the fault of the moderators for allowing these things to occur; but I assure you, we will not allow it to occur any longer.  If you have noticed, quite a few more warnings, moderations, and mutes have been handed out in an attempt to bring down the occurrence of the elitist remarks.</p>
<p>I personally do not see a need to pick new moderators - the jobs that we are supposed to be doing are being fulfilled, which is simply all that is asked of us.  So by asking for new moderators, you are simply telling us that the work we are doing isn’t in your liking.  Did we ask you if you liked it?  Do we truly care if you like it?  You aren’t supposed to like a certain moderator for them to be doing a decent job.  Ever wondered why you all have different opinions of us?  This is because you all have your own interpretation of the rules, and our interpretation may not match yours.  As the rules state, the rules are to be enforced at the moderator’s discretion.  So please, if you truly have question about an action we have made, send us a PM about it so we can try to resolve it, and explain to you why the certain action was taken.  If you are still unable to come to a conclusion to us and still can not blatantly see where you have done wrong, take it to an administrator and they will deal with the issue at a mature level.</p>
<p>In regards to mistakes by any staff member; just ask yourself: in the end, was the correct action taken?  Was the moderator able to resolve the mistake they had made in a responsible matter?  We are not perfect, guys.  We will never be perfect, and certainly what matters is that we realize what we did wrong and fix it, and learn not to re-enact the mistake.  Yes, we all have made mistakes one time or another, but I certainly do not recall any major problem that occurred with an error made by a moderator.  If you believe we have made a mistake, please, PM us.  We would rather have the action correct than have several people unhappy.<br>

If you’re worried about the community, do something about it. Don’t sit around and whine and want people to do it for you (cough TeleNubby). If you’re saying the community is shit, etc, is there a bot out there that doesn’t suck? No, there’s how to contribute.<br>
[/quote]I’m not going to start something and watch you guys disagree/not participate/not contribute. It’s happened before and I have no interest in allowing that to happen again (cough Yz85Racer). And honestly, are you high, because you keep saying weird things (e.g. is there a BOT - unless I’m not getting something).[/quote]<br>
Auto/Bot, etc.</p>
<p>But seriously, you do whine and bitch about the state of the community. Not saying it is a bad thing, but for as long as I can remember about being around the scene, it’s always been like this, the only new thing about the “elitism” problem is that it has gone from the word ‘troll’ to ‘elitist’.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should stop being a fool and blaming the staff, maybe they are at hand responsible, and I actually agree with you that it’s partly their fault, but it isn’t completely. We tried putting new moderators in, Thug-life, Yakman and Tico135. Did it work? No, not really. Not saying they do a bad job, but Tico135 has made more mistakes than I can count to, Yakman isn’t very active (moderating wise), and I don’t really have anything to say about Thug-life because he’s handled it well.</p>

<p>An improvement can only be made once this member base shifts to another community with a completely new setup. It’s only in this transition that a major change can be made.</p>

<p>This has been tried and tested multiple times. It’s not possible for a community to be successful if it is sharing another’s member base. It simply does not work. The only reason mitb managed to gain popularity was because it drew from a dead communities member base.</p>

<p>It’s because you both are idiots. I came to this conclusion by looking through your recent posts. I don’t apologize for my comments at all. In the other topics, i simply pointed out that your attempts at elitism were not justified at all.</p>
<p>Example: <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,321230.msg2541565.html#msg2541565" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,321230.msg2541565.html#msg2541565</a></p>
<blockquote>This is not a way to think of our staff members that actually do work on the site they are intended to do work on when you do none of it yourself. I suggest stopping the hypocrisy on this matter, because if I recall correctly, you did not shout-out and try to prevent these promotions from occuring. That might not be your point, as I am just pointing a finger at you due to my assumption, but this goes for the rest of the staff. Complaining about what they do is not right, rather, why not try to help them out? Nobody is perfect, and if you are more experienced in the field they are trying to succeed in, why not help them out? You were in that position too, so acting all high and mighty would be a foolish thing to do.</blockquote>
<p>I think you missed the point a bit. I’m saying that the <span class="bbcode-b">admin’s</span> shouldn’t be blamed for the selections because the other staff members did have the opportunity to object to them.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">@ Thread Responses</span></p>
<p>It’s great to see a few opinions being expressed. However, this topic was simply created to inform a few people of what actually happens and why certain members shouldn’t be criticized. It’s really that simple. If i was to list every individual problems then i would be here all day.</p>
<p>Any solutions presented would be too hard to implement and we seem to think that if it works, then we should just leave it.</p>
<p>[sub]EDIT: Expanded the paragraphs on the thread responses.[/sub]</p>
