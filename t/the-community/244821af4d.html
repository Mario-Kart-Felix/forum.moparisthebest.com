        <p>The factor of elitism can be blamed by the moderators, to a certain extent.  To the other extent, it may also be blamed on those who bring the elitist comments among themselves, and just generally people in the community.  It is partially at the fault of the moderators for allowing these things to occur; but I assure you, we will not allow it to occur any longer.  If you have noticed, quite a few more warnings, moderations, and mutes have been handed out in an attempt to bring down the occurrence of the elitist remarks.</p>
<p>I personally do not see a need to pick new moderators - the jobs that we are supposed to be doing are being fulfilled, which is simply all that is asked of us.  So by asking for new moderators, you are simply telling us that the work we are doing isn’t in your liking.  Did we ask you if you liked it?  Do we truly care if you like it?  You aren’t supposed to like a certain moderator for them to be doing a decent job.  Ever wondered why you all have different opinions of us?  This is because you all have your own interpretation of the rules, and our interpretation may not match yours.  As the rules state, the rules are to be enforced at the moderator’s discretion.  So please, if you truly have question about an action we have made, send us a PM about it so we can try to resolve it, and explain to you why the certain action was taken.  If you are still unable to come to a conclusion to us and still can not blatantly see where you have done wrong, take it to an administrator and they will deal with the issue at a mature level.</p>
<p>In regards to mistakes by any staff member; just ask yourself: in the end, was the correct action taken?  Was the moderator able to resolve the mistake they had made in a responsible matter?  We are not perfect, guys.  We will never be perfect, and certainly what matters is that we realize what we did wrong and fix it, and learn not to re-enact the mistake.  Yes, we all have made mistakes one time or another, but I certainly do not recall any major problem that occurred with an error made by a moderator.  If you believe we have made a mistake, please, PM us.  We would rather have the action correct than have several people unhappy.</p>

<p>Perfection has been attained. It was called Kaitnieks</p>

</aside>
<p>Kait’s was different. WAY different.<br>
Back then, cheating wasn’t really for the masses, kait’s had what, perhaps 2-5k members, whereas this board has 250k members.<br>
The community “feeling” has gone away due to macroing becoming widespread (and perhaps also private servers), which imo is the cause for the sorry state of RS cheating.</p>

<p>Kaitnieks reached 40k in members.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Wasn’t that around the time of aryan/rsps?<br>
I remember a time where kait’s was like 2-5k members…[/quote]</p>
<p>Kait was best when it was around 2-5k members :(…and people were learning and posting stuff in the community hacking tips…a section that completley died when aryan came out. =(</p>
