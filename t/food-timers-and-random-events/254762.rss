    <title>Food Timers?and Random Events?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/food-timers-and-random-events/254762</link>
    <description>Anyone describe to me how to put in food timers and a good time for the food.
Also
if you know how to add in random events that would be great too.
But
I only want them to get events if they are thieving or object training not when they are standing there or pking.</description>
