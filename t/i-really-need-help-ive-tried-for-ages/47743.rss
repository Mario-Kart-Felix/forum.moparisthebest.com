              <p>Alright, gonna try and give you a quick run through</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a>
</li>
<li>Click “hosts/redirects”</li>
<li>Create a new one, make sure your IP matches the one in your top left hand corner</li>
<li>When done, you need to set up you’re router (if you have one)</li>
</ol>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>1.Go to start<br>
2. Click Run<br>
3. Type in ‘cmd’ and press enter (no quotemarks)<br>
4. type in “ipconfig /all” (again no quotemarks) and press enter<br>
5. The “default gateway” should be something like 192.168.1.x (x being a number). Put that into your Internet Browser (e.g Internet Explorer) and press enter<br>
6. Find “Virtual server”. If it asks for a password, it’s usually:</p>
<p>Username: Admin/Administrator<br>
Password: Admin/(no password)</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Now, you should have a screen that says about “port redirecting” somewhere. You’ll have to find this yourself I’m afraid</li>
<li>It should now bring you up a screen with some blank boxes, and a dropdown box saying UDP/TCP/ TCP\UDP.<br>
You must enter the port you are using for your server (either 43594 or 5555 usually)</li>
<li>Now, set these to both UDP/TCP. (P.S. If you use the UDP/TCP box, and it doesn’t work, try using UDP, TCP *and TCP/UDP. Worked for me =-))</li>
<li>Set the redirection to your IP (do steps 3+4 to find this out)</li>
<li>That should be you done. First get your friends to try to connect to your IP (<a href="http://www.ipchicken.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.ipchicken.com</a>). If they connect to your IP, but not you’re no-ip, post back =-)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry if this is too complicated, feel free to pm me if you need more help.</p>
