    <description>I saw in the RSC development, how they all work on making one server better (at least i think :P) I was thinking maybe we can get a few people here to work together to make an awesome server.  I can help with it.  Just post whether or not you would like this, just an idea.

~If we do this, I would like people with at least enough experience to code the server, not just follow tutorials.
