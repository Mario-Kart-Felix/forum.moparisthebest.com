    <description>Hey,

     I&#39;m working on my first script. One that I&#39;m pretty sure has never been published before. It&#39;s a silk buyer. I don&#39;t know if anyone knows this, but if you buy silk from the silk merchant in alkharid for only 3gp each, you can sell it to the silk merchant in Ardy for 60gp each. That&#39;s a 57gp profit per silk, and there&#39;s no worrying about whether or not prices will drop. Anyways, this is my first script, and I&#39;m having some problems with it. The bank functions don&#39;t work for me, so I&#39;ve had to make my own. I haven&#39;t integrated multi-player yet, I&#39;m waiting for later versions. I plan on implementing anti-randoms and bans, but I&#39;m gonna wait till the script has it&#39;s full bare structure. Logging in works ok, then 95% of the time it doesn&#39;t have a problem finding the bank. Then getting to the silk seller is where I really need help. I&#39;ve never actually gotten all the way there. Please take a look at my script, maybe run it, and maybe try to help? Anyone who gives any help or suggestions ends up in my credits when I publish this. And considering this is probably the first of it&#39;s kind, I think that&#39;d be pretty cool. Anyways, here&#39;s the script. Thanks.

[code]program BuzzysSilkBuyer;

//2. Setup lines  16-18

end;

procedure BuySilk;  //can&#39;t get to click seller, but otherwise works.

until(silktemp &gt;=27);
end;

begin
SetupSRL;
LogIn;
GetCash;
GotoSeller;
BuySilk;
end.[/code]

I know that there&#39;s plenty of things left to do, but I&#39;m really just focusing on the path to the silk seller from the bank at the moment. I&#39;m making this in Divi , just thought I&#39;d say something because I haven&#39;t tried it in 2.03. Please try to help.

Thanks,
Buzzy

Ps. For the banking to work, you have to be in the 3rd to last bank slot. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Perhaps try reading some tutorials on RadialRoadWalk<br>
The only way I can think of to get places in Al kharid is RRW or Using FindSymbol.</p>
<p>Perhaps keep radialroadwalking until you can findsymbol then walk there</p>
<p>And try using DeclarePlayers and then the SRL log in function</p>
