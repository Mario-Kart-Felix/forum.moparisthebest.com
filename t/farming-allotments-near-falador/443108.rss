    <title>Farming allotments near falador</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/farming-allotments-near-falador/443108</link>
    <description>The formula that The Wanderer(AJ) gave me won&#39;t work with the client I&#39;m using.  I think this client got 508 objects dumped, which wrote over the varbits somehow.  It works perfect with a blank 317 client, but with this client it acts weird as hell.  I&#39;ve tried many bitshifting formulas to send the state, and it sends it to one of the allotments, but fucks up the other one completely.

Does anybody have any other formulas they could share?

Other than this: 
((patch1 &lt;&lt; 16) + ((patch2 &lt;&lt; 8) &lt;&lt; 16) + ((1 &lt;&lt; 8) + patch3) + (patch4 &lt;&lt; 8))</description>
