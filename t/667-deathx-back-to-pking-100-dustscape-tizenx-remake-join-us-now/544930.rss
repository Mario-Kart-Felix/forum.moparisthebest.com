It&#39;s more LIKE a TIZEN-X REMAKE!


-Why us ?

We have a VERY detailed advertisement below, if you wish to view it then go ahead! If not, I will give you a quick writing about why to choose DeathX over others. Firstly, DeathX has been online now for 1 Week, and isn&#39;t going offline anytime soon. So, if you were to invest time and effort in building your DeathX character, it isn&#39;t going to waste. We started off as a 100% pvp server, but over the year we&#39;ve developed into a more broader audience, meaning that we include PvM, bosses, dicing, skilling and minigame elements into the game. We have flawlessly coded unique features such as killstreaks, upgradable weapons &amp; armour, custom gear selections, random pvp drops, and the newly developed bindable items mod, which allows you to hold your swords, whips, bows, staffs and shields on your back or on your hip holsters. We also brags about the custom minigames we offer to our players; with a zombie survival minigame just released, players are slaying zombies left right and center. The zombies minigames are included with rewards, where you can spend after slaying zombies. DeathX also has 100% installation of vote for rewards, where you can do exactly that. There are multiple voting rewards, ranging from pvp armour sets, cash and pvp tokens, to food, potions and miscellaneous items.
