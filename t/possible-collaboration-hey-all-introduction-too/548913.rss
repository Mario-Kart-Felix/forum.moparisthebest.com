    <title>Possible Collaboration? - Hey all [Introduction too!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/possible-collaboration-hey-all-introduction-too/548913</link>
    <description>Greetings everyone, my name is Kenneth Emerson, AKA Xsnip3rX (my original account on here was never activated and i tried to activate it time and time again and i guess i set the registration for it to the wrong email...) so here&#39;s Xsnip3rX(1)....!...

Back in the days of RSPS&#39;s being born... i made MythScape, one of the first (i think the third or fourth RS2 Private server), i brought a few guys on to help me code it... Ramenryoko, AridTag, Spikes of Christ, and one other guy, can&#39;t remember his name at the moment, so, i kinda shared the source code with them, honestly, it was a shitty source, barely had trading.... no pking, no dueling, no combat period yet, all you could do is stand in the area where the punching bags were across from the bank and spawn rares all the time and hit the sacks for exp gain... anywho, for the time i guess that was amazing... so AridTag and Spikes of Christ modified my source code, added following and a few other things and released it...source code and all, now there&#39;s a million RSPS&#39;s out there.  :palm:

So there&#39;s my back story and introduction.... now to the good stuff... if anyone is interested in collaborating with me, I am willing to share my code and make a complete server, i&#39;d like to have as complete of a server as possible... if this sounds interesting for anyone, please reply to this thread or private message me.  :)

Thanks - Xsnip3rX</description>

Not sure if you are referring to old rs2 or RSC.</p>
<p>Here is also a link for EasyRSC it’s very beginner friendly:<br>

<p>Make sure you have jdk1.6_35 that’s what I set the compiler to specifically.<br>

Thanks, i’m using NoobScape V3 until i get back into the swing of things, wouldn’t mind getting my hands on rscd v25 though, so far i’ve de-customized the NoobScape client and server, it’s pretty much back to vanilla rsc.</p>
<p>The first server i coded was RS2, but since i got into coding rsc servers i haven’t felt the need to return to rs2 servers.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested please let me know.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not sure if you’re still active, but I’d be interested in a de-customized Noobscape V3, but my knowledge in coding only basic java.  I’ve never messed with RSC so I don’t even know how to get mine to work as is.</p>
