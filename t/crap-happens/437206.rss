    <title>Crap Happens</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crap-happens/437206</link>
    <description>Something&#39;s up. I have no idea why this happens and this isn&#39;t the VPS&#39;s fault.

Skyru and I can&#39;t figure out what it is either.

Entire CMD window (the very bottom is where it happens):
