    <title>[Tut] What programming language is right for you?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-what-programming-language-is-right-for-you/19905</link>
    <description>First of all I would like to say that I got this idea from Scar :P He said he was going to do this, but since he is still learning his language, I thought I would beat him too it. If he objects, I will give all the credit to him ;D Also If some of my information is wrong, or I forgot to mention something (which I know I did because I am writing this fast), just post it and I will fix it.

So let&#39;s start! What programming language is right for you? Thats a pretty broad question. There are many, many, many programming languages for you to choose from. The answer to the question ultimatly comes down to what you want to do:

1.) Make Programs
2.) Make Games
3.) Web design
4.) Program for fun
5.) Program for a living
6.) Learning how to program/General Programming
7.) Etc.

So once you have picked one of these, we can take a closer look at things. 

[b]GENERAL PROGRAMMING:[/b]

If you want to go with just a general programming language (one to just start off with), I would definatly go with HTML. Even though it is for Web Design, it is a verrry easy language to learn, and remember, this is for someone with no programming experiance at all. 

After you have masterd the fruitful art of HTML, go with Java. Not JavaScript. Java and JavaScript are different. But anyways back to the point. Java is a great language to get the feel for things. It gives you an idea of what real programming is like.

[b]MAKING GENERAL PROGRAMS:[/b]

For making general programs, I think you should deffinatly get into Java or VB. They are both great languages for making applications. Just about anything you can think of can be made with one of these languages.

[b]GAME PROGRAMMING[/b]

This is the area I am interested in right now ;D For making games I would DEFINATLY go with C++ or a Blitz language. You might say, &quot;What about Java?&quot;. Although one could spend time making a game with Java, Bltiz is just perfect for making games (although a little outdated) and C++ is 20 times faster than Java, so it makes the game run smoooooother.

[b]WEB DESIGN[/b]

Hey, what can I say? Web Design is a great skill to have, so go with the first language you I mentioned...HTML. It is probably the most common Web Design language used. Also JavaScript, PHP, XHTML, and others are great also (see list at bottom for others because I am writing this fast and know I am forgetting any).

[b]PROGRAMMING FOR FUN[/b]

Again, for programming for fun, Java is a GREAT language to learn. It can be used for so many things, like RuneScape. Overall Java is just a great langauge. VB is also great. And (correct me If I am wrong) Delphi is good for just general programming also. And here we come to probably the best language for just messing around with (especially on this forum), SCAR (Pascal). It is great to make scripts with (I don&#39;t know SCAR but I whish I did.) Overall, If you know SCAR and make good scripts for RuneScape and other things it will earn you respect in many places (if they like RuneScape ;D. If you don&#39;t like RuneScape, don&#39;t learn this language, even though it can be used for other things, it is primarily used for SCAR scripting).

[b]PROGRAMMING FOR A LIVING:[/b]

C++/C all the way. Lots of companies use C/C++ because it is a fast and flexible language. If you are looking to get into programming for a living learn C++ for shure, and then (again) possibly Java.

So there you have it, some of the information is probably missing of incorrect, but just post it, and I will correct it. Also, here is a list of languages:

PROGRAMMING:
C++
C
C#
Java
VB
Delphi
Pascal

WEB DESIGN:
HTML
XHTML
JavaScript
PHP

(note: these are not all of the languages, there are hundereds, but that is all I could think of off the top of my head, so if you have more post them)</description>

<p>not really, and if you really wanted the speed you would go with assembly :)[/quote]<br>
Assembly is only as fast as you program it to be. A program in C++ gets optimized for speed when it compiles.</p>
<p>And programming in ASM (generally) isn’t practical except for programs that need direct interaction with hardware.</p>
