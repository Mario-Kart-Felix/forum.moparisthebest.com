    <title>Would you share your .minecraft folder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-you-share-your-minecraft-folder/376956</link>
    <description>when i get my minecraft folder uploaded i will post a link here. [url=http://p2spvw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p3Oicei0WOsI6Ht_jVD1YUAroHEjjCP-GiYQ2TEEgqQvAND93TCxhpjh_U3n3YyZ3Quifdr7hAfppTjt3CLfKS4mX1_92GCsy/minecraft.zip]http://p2spvw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1p3Oicei0WOsI6Ht_jVD1YUAroHEjjCP-GiYQ2TEEgqQvAND93TCxhpjh_U3n3YyZ3Quifdr7hAfppTjt3CLfKS4mX1_92GCsy/minecraft.zip[/url]

i thought i would share the libraries i put in the native folder to make it run on my linux set-up. but i was hoping someone that bought the client, and has a custom skin; could post a zip of that folder. the zip should contain: the bin, and resource folders; options.txt; and any other file/folder excluding saves, and texturepacks. thank you if you do. if you dont want to post it on here you could pm me it. im wanting to see something is why im wanting to see someone to give me their MC folder zip.</description>

              <p>sorry for the post being difficult to read. i definitely need to work on my verbal and written communications. i dont believe it would matter very much what the os is. If it did i have a mac vm. but what im wanting it for i dont think the os matters. i believe mac is a bsd variant. I thank you if upload.</p>

              <p>That was quite difficult to read…  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Anyway, I would upload mine but I’m running on Mac OS X. Does this matter greatly? Linux and Mac are very similar…</p>
