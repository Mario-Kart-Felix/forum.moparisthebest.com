    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/corb-lund-band/2052</link>
    <description>Who here likes Corb Lund Band?  It&#39;s country music(here me out:) but the good kind :)

It&#39;s a bunch of sweet tunes, banjo&#39;s and everything. Download the song The truck got stuck, and tell me what you think ;) The songs usually tell a story or adventure, and they are really catchy. Go listen to &quot;the truck got stuck&quot; :)

<p>He passed out on impact, was legally dead for a few minutes. Ambulence came, somehow revived him, he then died over night from severe brain damage. This guy was in his 20’s, and the guy who hit him didnt go to jail, I still dont understand why. The guy who hit him is named Josh Brash, he’s well known as a criminal in our town yet he never goes to jail for anymore then a night. After he got hit with a baseball bat, my friends uncle took a round with him, and still kicked his ass after being hit with the bat a few times. We were all very drunk, and was one hell of a crazy night, but not very fun <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I searched google to see if there was an article, hoping our local newspaper would have published it on the net but I could not find. I still dont know everything that happened that night, but it was all caused because when they opened up the truck door they hit that Josh guys car very slightly(not even a dent).</p>
<p>Just goes to show that small towns can be just as dangerous as a large city. <em>Siver’s</em> I can still remember that sound the baseball bat made. Sounded so hollow.</p>

              <p>I do not like country for the most part, theres just a few of them that are pretty cool. I suppose my choice of music is also influenced by my friends. I listen to al lot of music, except rap and death metal.  When we do our mud runs we listen to this kind of music, even some Johnny Cash as well <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Mud Runs are whenever we get like 20 people and we race trucks through paths we made in the forest, we do it usually when its extremely muddy. I only drove once, and feaked out a little too much(Im only 15). Last year someone died though, my friends sisters boyfriend’s friend(rofl) got hit over the head by a baseball bat, I’ll never forget that aweful sound.</p>

<p>I can deal with some Martina McBride, Clay Walker, Travis Tritt, Garth Brooks. But the new country is lame and is starting to get too sexual.</p>
