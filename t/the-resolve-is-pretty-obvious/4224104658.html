yeah, this idea has been proposed for a while now… oh well, but couldn’t you just write a mod for that or something? I mean, you can do that with smf, amiright?</p>
<p>And the reason it would be needed, in my opinion, is to bring sense back into servers here, now its just pi this, pi that,<br>
[PI] HALPPPP, and just a shit load of leeches and viruses, and it would be a great idea, because there are some people here who I’m pretty sure are willing to do this, and we can keep all of that off here and on r-s or something</p>

I remember this one dude, mr silabsoft, who was F A I L S or something with a new acc cuz he was mad (was  trolling or something and death muted him) and no one was there to stop him, me and him were practically the only ones online at the time… he did alot of it before someone finally came in the morning or something and finally cleaned it all up, see, if we had some people like that, it could have been preventable, because they have a duty and they would stay online longer to… well… do it, and like I said, a visible sign or anything like mopar mods and other badges, that wouldn’t be needed, best keep it secret, or not even, there would be no point of it, its just a duty, if they want to do it, they can.</p>
