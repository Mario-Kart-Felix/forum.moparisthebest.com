    <title>The resolve is pretty obvious -.-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-resolve-is-pretty-obvious/422410</link>
    <description>Well, as you know the download section is full of morons. From leechers to idiots who over and over again posts in wrong section.
Been having this on mind for awhile and it&#39;s pretty obvious how to fix this... before reading the text below, try to figure out.

Since the tutorial section is locked by approval system whitch means moderators has to check it before it gets posted for real, why not add this in the download section? where it is actually needed? I dont know what you think but it&#39;s pretty obvious resolve.

If i spelled something wrong please tell me

I remember this one dude, mr silabsoft, who was F A I L S or something with a new acc cuz he was mad (was  trolling or something and death muted him) and no one was there to stop him, me and him were practically the only ones online at the time… he did alot of it before someone finally came in the morning or something and finally cleaned it all up, see, if we had some people like that, it could have been preventable, because they have a duty and they would stay online longer to… well… do it, and like I said, a visible sign or anything like mopar mods and other badges, that wouldn’t be needed, best keep it secret, or not even, there would be no point of it, its just a duty, if they want to do it, they can.</p>

yeah, this idea has been proposed for a while now… oh well, but couldn’t you just write a mod for that or something? I mean, you can do that with smf, amiright?</p>
<p>And the reason it would be needed, in my opinion, is to bring sense back into servers here, now its just pi this, pi that,<br>
[PI] HALPPPP, and just a shit load of leeches and viruses, and it would be a great idea, because there are some people here who I’m pretty sure are willing to do this, and we can keep all of that off here and on r-s or something</p>

It used to be moderated, they removed that feature. It wasn’t necessary and not many people could create a server good enough for moderators expectations.<br>

Used to be yes, when it was there users wanted it removed, now it’s gone people want it back, can’t win…<br>
If I recall correctly, it was a limitation of the forum upgrade anyway, so even if we did want it back I’m not sure it’d be possible.[/quote]<br>
The upgrade from 1.1.x to 2.0.1 made the package unusable.</p>

<p>Hardly?  Most of the time there’s either no reports or 1 or 2, if anything, the users need to report more.  And no, it is not our job to go through the whole forum and find the rule breaking topics ourselves.</p>

              <p>Well, as you know the download section is full of morons. From leechers to idiots who over and over again posts in wrong section.<br>
Been having this on mind for awhile and it’s pretty obvious how to fix this… before reading the text below, try to figure out.</p>
<p>Since the tutorial section is locked by approval system whitch means moderators has to check it before it gets posted for real, why not add this in the download section? where it is actually needed? I dont know what you think but it’s pretty obvious resolve.</p>
