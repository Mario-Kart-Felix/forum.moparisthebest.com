    <description>This is just a reminder that there are to be [size=12pt][b][u]NO[/u][/b][/size] server/forum advertisements at all on MoparScape. Lately there have been tons of server/forum advertisement topics, and these need to stop. There is a [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php][b]Server Status Page[/b][/url] for a reason. If you are posting a link to a forum, don&#39;t bother, it will only give you a punishment.

If you are posting it on the forums because you are having an error that your server is &quot;offline,&quot; [b]that means you are doing something wrong[/b], in which case you should visit [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,200036.0.html][b]this topic[/b][/url]. All topics advertising servers will be removed [b]without[/b] warning. 

Thank you for your cooperation,
