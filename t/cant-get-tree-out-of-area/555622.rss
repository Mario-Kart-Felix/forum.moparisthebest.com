    <title>Can&#39;t Get Tree Out of Area</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-tree-out-of-area/555622</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using TrisidiaX V3 Source and TrisidiaX V2 Client (For the CPanel)
Theres an Fing tree by lottie. Lottie is located in edgeville bank. Does anyone know the file where I can erase the tree?

EDIT:
Still having trouble getting rid of the tree. The coordinates are: 3092, 3497, ground level.
These coor are not on objectmanager.java or objecthandler.java and I can&#39;t figure out how to get rid of it.</description>

              <p>I know your server is PI based but by any chance is there a makeGlobalObject in ur client.java? I mean I could be wrong but if it’s not in objectHandler.java or objectManager.java maybe it’s because your server pulls objects from client.java too</p>

Do you have any data on the object?</p>
<p>Like can you click it and it prints out an ID? it’s coords?</p>
<p>That actually looks like an object that was custom spawned. When you teleport to edgeville, does it take a second for that object to show up?<br>
[/quote]<br>
There is no option to do anything with. On right-click there is only ‘walk here’ the Chair near it, on right-click, I get ‘examine’, ‘walk here’. When I was messing with the code, I would notice it would sometimes turn the chair into the tree, and other times the table would disappear, or all 3 would be there. And it takes like 2-4sec to spawn everytime I log in or tele.[/quote]<br>
Okay that means it’s being spawned somewhere within your server.<br>
The fun part is finding out where.</p>
<p>Use noclip to walk where the object is spawned then use ::object 2213.<br>
That should spawn a bank booth. If the object deletes, you now have it’s coords, and you can use ::mypos to find where it is. From there, you just search for the X, Y and remove whatever is spawning it.</p>
<p>If the object is still there, you didn’t stand in the right position.</p>

<p>There should be a list of objects already being spawned in it, just add in the coords for the tree and set the object id to -1. Make sure the object type is 10 or it may not delete.[/quote]<br>
So I’ve added in the coor for the tree, and here is the whole section:</p>
<p><code>//Edgeville Pking Zone
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3095, 3498, 1, 10);
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3096, 3498, 1, 10);
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3095, 3499, 1, 10);
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3090, 3494, 1, 10);
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3091, 3495, 1, 10);  //chair in front of lottie3091,3495
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3094, 3496, 1, 10);  //table in front of lottie3094,4396
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3090, 3496, 1, 10);
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3093, 3488, 1, 10);
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3092, 3488, 1, 10);
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 3092, 3497, -1, 10); //added in dumbass tree coor
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 2689, 3716, 1, 10);
		c.getPA().checkObjectSpawn(-1, 2689, 3715, 1, 10);</code><br>
What am I doing wrong?</p>
