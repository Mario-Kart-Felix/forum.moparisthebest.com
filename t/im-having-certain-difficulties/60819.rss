              <p>Well that means either, your account has been corrupted in some way or fashion, and because most serverbases can’t recognize a corrupt account, it gives you generic messages, or two logic would dictate that the servers may actually be down contrary to popular belief because of the misgivings of a status page, and that’s without the inexplicable fact that your account may infact be logged in.</p>
<p>Also: it may be a hamachi network, and your not in that network, or have some problems that reject packets from the server.</p>
