    <title>Oh dear you died in clan wars...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/oh-dear-you-died-in-clan-wars/179790</link>
    <description>Ok all  i did was add this.


[code]if(loseNoItems()) {
		teleportToX = 3487;
		teleportToY = 3090;
		heightLevel = 0;
		//pEmote = 15;
		//pWalk = 13;
		sendMessage(&quot;Oh dear you died in clanwars!&quot;);
		hitDiff = 0;	
		updateRequired = true; appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
	} else if(!loseNoItems()) {
}[/code]

after this...
[code]public void youdied()
		{[/code]


And it compiles successfully. 

then i added this.

[code]public boolean loseNoItems() {
	if(absX &gt;= 3330 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3359 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3204 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 

3221)
	return true;
	else
		return false;
}[/code]

under this.

[code]public class client extends Player implements Runnable {[/code]

then compiled and it compiled successfully. But whenever i pk at that certain spot where ur not &quot;suppose&quot; to lose items, u lose items!!!

and when you die it says this.

[code]Oh dear you died in clanwars!
Oh dear you lost all your items...
Oh dear you died in clanwars!
Oh dear you lost all your items...
[/code]

any1 help?</description>

<p>EDIT:<br>
heres you’re fix i hope</p>
<p>ok make this coding</p>
<p>[code]public boolean loseNoItems() {<br>

<li>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>return true;
else

</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>look like this</p>
<p><code>public void loseNoItems() {
if((absX &gt;= 3330 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3359 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3204 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3221))
}</code></p>
<p>and put it right under</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class client extends Player implements Runnable {</code></pre>
<p>then look for</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void initialize()</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean initialize()</code></pre>
<p>i got the void not the boolean so odds are you’ll have the same unless ur using a diffrent source that use’s it as a boolean</p>
<p>anyways once ur at that void/boolean scroll down untill you find you’re welcome message’s like i have mine, mine look like this</p>
<p><code>if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("blablabla")) {
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = "SERVER OWNER blablabla IS ONLINE START BEHAVING!";
}</code></p>
<p>if it’s not the same then just change the</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">blablabla</code></pre>
<p>to whatevery you have your’s set to and the</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">PlayerHandler.messageToAll = "SERVER OWNER blablabla IS ONLINE START BEHAVING!";</code></pre>
<p>dosn’t have to be in ur line of coding thats just what i have lol</p>
<p>and under that last } that you see in the code above simply just add this under it</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">loseNoItems();</code></pre>
<p>if you can’t find the welcome message that you see above just try putting the</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">loseNoItems();</code></pre>
<p>right under you’re</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void initialize()</code></pre>
<p>so it looks something like this</p>
<p><code>public void initialize() {
loseNoItems();</code></p>
<p>or if you’re { is in antoher place it might look like this</p>
<p><code>public void initialize()
        {</code></p>
<p>if thats the case then just add the</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">loseNoItems();</code></pre>
<p>under</p>
<p><code>public void initialize()
        {</code></p>
<p>to make it look like this</p>
<p><code>public void initialize()
        {
loseNoItems();</code></p>
<p>and the hopefully u wont loose items when u die in that sertian area that u have coded if it dosn’t work or if u get any errors post’em i’ll try to help fix for ya, i tryed making this as simple as i could so thats why it’s kinda long lol</p>
<p>R3P++ would be very apreciated[/quote]weni die i still lose itemz?</p>
