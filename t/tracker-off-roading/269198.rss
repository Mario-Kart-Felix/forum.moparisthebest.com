    <title>Tracker off roading</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tracker-off-roading/269198</link>
    <description>So, me and a buddy were driving around talking about how bored we are, and he says its time we start on this off road deal, we have been wanting to get a vehicle or make one, well found out a friend had a running 93 geo tracker in his back yard, not bad at 480$.

So weve got this crashed tracker, runs fine, needs an alternator, belt, and some brake work. Nothing major, no hood or driver side headlight lol.

end Random info i felt like throwing in.

So, we have a mad low budget, it was a cheap fucker we got just for fucking around and off roading with. Any one know anything we can do to make it better that doesn&#39;t cost an arm n leg? So far our only idea is suspension spacers or w/e. We want a winch but I doubt we can afford one, any cheap brands that work nicely? And, opinions, &lt; $500 for a running tracker, are they worth it?</description>

<p>I’m fairly confident they are identical vehicles, with different branding on them.  I know the Geo Tracker was made by suzuki at least.</p>
<p>My advice would be not to spend much, get some nice used tires at a junk yard (make sure all 4 are the exact same size) and if you want to try to jack up the rear end you can with some $30 dollar blocks from autozone, but I believe the front end has independant suspension and therefore there is no easy or cheap way to raise it.</p>
<p>If you want a good, cheap winch, check out harbor freight tools (you can order online or go to a local store if there is one near you)</p>
