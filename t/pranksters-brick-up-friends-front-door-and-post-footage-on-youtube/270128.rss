    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Leigh Black began plotting his revenge after his friend Dave Pearce sneaked into his house while he was away and rearranged all of his furniture.

In retaliation, when Mr Pearce went away on holiday to Thailand, Mr Black teamed up with friends Shannon Sellick, Jason Giovanni and Si Orr, to build a brick wall across his front door.

The friends, all from Bridgwater, Somerset, filmed their caper from start to finish and have now posted the footage on the video sharing website.

Mr Sellick said: &quot;When Leigh went away a few weeks ago Dave got in his house and swapped everything upstairs with everything downstairs and was there waiting for him when he got back.

&quot;So we decided to get our revenge and when Dave went away to Thailand for a few days last week we built a brick wall over his front door as a nice surprise and were there waiting for him when he got back.&quot;

Despite being heavily jet-lagged after his flight home from Thailand, Mr Pearce saw the funny side of the prank and managed to knock the wall down.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
