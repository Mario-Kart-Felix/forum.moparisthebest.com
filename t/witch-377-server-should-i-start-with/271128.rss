    <title>Witch [377] server should i start with?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/witch-377-server-should-i-start-with/271128</link>
    <description>[b]M[/b][b]E[/b][b]T[/b][b]A[/b][b]L[/b] here,

I have a question that might me easy for some people to answer. But first a little about me since this is my first post... I&#39;ve been working on a server that hasn&#39;t been released to the public for a quite some time it&#39;s a 317 now. I started before Miss Silabsoft released her client with the newer items. So i&#39;ve been working on it for some time now, i&#39;ve put the newer items on including Dragon Plate body, Dragon Claws, ECT, ECT. But I want to convert all my work into a [377] server.. For the people that are gonna say &quot;LOL noob you can&#39;t do that.&quot; Witch people will say that. I converted my work from an old server to a [317]. I admit some stuff didn&#39;t work but most of it did. So I will post another topic somewhere else saying my accomplishments on my server.

So if you have any suggestions on a starting [377] server please post here I&#39;m been looking, i&#39;ve got one i might use but I want to here from you guys/girls.</description>
