    <description>Hello there 
Kreedomscape is a brand new RSPS, put online Today!!!. We&#39;re a friendly community who is looking for new staff and players,  We&#39;re not like other servers, everyone in our community will treat you with respect, and we dont have the over used edgeville home, but we added a twist and made it in Lumbridge  It&#39;s good, trust me!
 
Kreedomscape Is an olschool server based on the 2007 era. 
Owner- Mod Raven
Co-Owner Mod Krow
Admins - None!
Moderators - None!

Here are some of the features we have in our server, not all, but some...
Dueling
God wars dungeon (FULLY working, kill counts needed [old rs gwd] )
Many different shops at home
Fully working lootshare (clan chat)
Bosses!
KBD
Daggonoth kings
chaos elemental
More coming soon...

Basic essentials available in shops
24/7 hosted
Fully working barrows
Pest control
Tzhaar caves
Fully working PK&#39;ing
Easy to switch prayers, Altars at edge!
Owner and co-owner on alot so you can easily get help
AND MUCH MUCH MORE! 

Unfortuantley, I cannot upload pics due to problems with my PC, but the link to the webclient and downloadable client is https://www.rspscoding.org/play/?server=KreedomScape
If you&#39;re webclient isn&#39;t working, follow these steps.
1) Control panel
2) Search Java
3) Press Java
4) Security
5) Edit site list
6) Add these three sites to your list

Thanks,
Kreedom Team.</description>
