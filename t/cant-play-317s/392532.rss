    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-play-317s/392532</link>
    <description>K so I used to able to play all 317&#39;s fine. But I can&#39;t anymore, it takes about 15 minutes for it load all the way and when I log in it&#39;s all laggy and my computer freezes and I have to reboot it.
  But I can play 508+ Fine.

Why?</description>

[/quote] however the newer version of the runescape client is less corrupt than the 317 due to the fact that it’s almost never edited. 317 cache’s are completely corrupt most of the time.[/quote]<br>
Then this would be a cache problem, not a hardware? Anyways, if the cache is the case, search for “508 looks” in the server downloads at the client I was working on. Worked fine on my old 2004 laptop, and my 2001 laptop (although a tad of lag on this one, due to the lack of hardware memory). This will tell you if the problem does persist in your computer, or some shitty programmer.</p>
