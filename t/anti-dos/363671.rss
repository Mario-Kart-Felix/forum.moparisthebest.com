    <description>DEOB: 317

Can somebody tell me how I can make my server so it doesn&#39;t crash when it get&#39;s dosed, or slowed down. Also, flooded. I don&#39;t know anything about this sort of program for RSPS, so if someone could help me out that would be fantastic.


Thanks.</description>

<p>Do you know what you are talking about?, don’t answer that…</p>
<p>To stop a flooder you can use an ArrayList, Hashtable, HashMap, a simple array, and many other things to stop people from logging on to multiple accounts on the same ip address.</p>

<p>I got flooded by no lifers who don’t know how to code but want a lot of players on a completely leeched source and my pc didn’t give a shit that they where flooding and just ignored it.</p>
<p>If the starter area is somewhere lots of people are at, then it will lagg you’r players and you’r server is more likely to crash.[/quote]Fixed grammar.</p>
<p>He wants to say that if you put the place you first login somewhere no players are at, those guys will only spam in that area and it won’t affect you’r players, because they can’t hear them. But if you set the starter area somewhere many players are at, then you’r players will feel the lagg because of all the spam they get.</p>
