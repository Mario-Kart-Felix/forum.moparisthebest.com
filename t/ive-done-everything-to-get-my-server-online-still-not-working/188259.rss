    <description>So heres the deal, i portfowarded, got no-ip and No-ip DUC running checked the smiley face (he&#39;s blushing) allowed an exception in my port. I have JDK and everything,[b] only people under my internet connection can connect 2 my server using my computers ip [/b] Everyone thats not under my internet connection say they get errors when trying to connect using my No-ip, computers ip, and even my internet ip. None of it works for them. How do i allow people that arent under my internet connection to connect to my server??

Portfowarding

Virtual Server (looked like an advanced portfoward so i filled it out as well, maybe i have to have both ports enabled instead of just TCP??)

My No-ip DUC
