    <title>PKScapeX Requires MySQL in JAVA Developers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pkscapex-requires-mysql-in-java-developers/171702</link>
    <description>PKScapeX is planned to be a big server not only based on pking but will also be involved with every skill.

The server is not far from being done and has been in development by me alone for just over 3 months now.

If you are quite experienced with MySQL in Java then you may wish to help me in the PKScapeX Development Team by assisting me with MySQL.

The main thing which i need to do right now is run the PKScapeX character files through MySQL.

I am in no way asking for someone to just give me the method of saving and loading through MySQL however i want to program it with someone else so i am doing as much as i can.

I am very familiar with MySQL in PHP but not in Java, and i pick up things very quickly which is good for you.

If you are interested in this you can contact me on this thread, by pming on here, or by pming me on the PKScapeX forum which can be located by clicking the link in my signature.

The PKScapeX forum also includes much more details on the server if you&#39;re interested.</description>

<p>MySQL in Java is a thing.</p>
<p>Its integrating MySQL into Java.</p>
<p>If i just said MySQL it wouldn’t be clear as i know a fair bit of MySQL, but only MySQL in PHP.</p>
