    <description>Someone refer&#39;d me to ask in the client section for this rather than server sided so here we go,

Hello rune server, i am currently trying to figure out were or what i would need to do to be able to change the game controls for my server, for example:

Currently you use arrow key&#39;s for camera and mouse to click your direction etc

What i want to do: Make it so WASD keys make you run forward/backward/side/side and &quot;right&quot; clicking the mouse and moving it will spin the camera 360 instead of arrow keys.

If anyone can help me with this i&#39;d apreciate it, please and thankyou</description>
