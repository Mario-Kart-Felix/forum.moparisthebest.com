              <p>when your editing your source its all in java so you will need to read your source only in a computer language.  Bruce Eckle wrote a book on how to read java and the download to the book is here <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/java/tij/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.codeguru.com/java/tij/</a> or you can just learn on your own and read the source, understand it, and code it.  and when you edit it you edit it as a java file</p>
