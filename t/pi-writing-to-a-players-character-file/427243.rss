    <title>[PI] Writing to a players character-file?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-writing-to-a-players-character-file/427243</link>
    <description>Ok, so I just added a voting system, however I&#39;ve modified it a little bit, so that once you&#39;ve voted and you log out and back in, an interface appears (If you&#39;ve voted).
(Which is currently linked up to my old voting system).

So the interface only appears when I change the character-file manually. 
from: (vote = 0) to (vote = 1).

If I do it manually, it works fine, however, my new voting system doesn&#39;t use character files to write to in order to grab the information, it uses phpmyadmin and MySQL. 

I was wondering if there&#39;s any way to make it write to the character file (as well as) writing to the PhpMyAdmin table?

Not sure what code I need to post on here, so will post upon request.. As I don&#39;t want to end up filling the thread up with random code that is of no use to anyone :/ 

Thanks in advance!</description>

              <p>Thanks, I’ll check it out, and it works using the old oting system, however the old system is no longer linked to anything, and therefore nothing ‘writes’ to the players character-file, meaning I had to do it manually, which made it work <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>So just need to link it to the new system, simply by making the new system write to character-files.</p>
<p>Many thanks yet again <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
