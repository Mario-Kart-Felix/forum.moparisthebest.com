    <title>Looking for partner to help set up RSPS + WebClient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-partner-to-help-set-up-rsps-webclient/402905</link>
    <description>Alright so I&#39;ve been searching for a while, trying to set up my own RSPS and WebClient.  After about 3 months, I have given up.  I simply decided that I am not smart enough to figure it out for myself lolz.  I am looking for a partner to help me set up a 317 RSPS and WebClient.  I will be willing to advertise for the server of whoever helps me or pay a certain percent of donation profits or something.  I would prefer that one of the following bases be used (It doesn&#39;t really matter which one)

Acrylicx
Demise PK
DesignX
FateScape
IceyyScape
Lost Valentino
Marc Scape
RuneClear
TarzanPVp
TrinityPK

Have any other questions?  Reply to this, or PM me.  MSN = rememberscape@live.com

First person to respond with a legitimate offer that I agree to is probably the one I will choose.

I am looking for someone WITH EXPERIENCE regarding this kind of thing.  Not a n00b like me lol.</description>
