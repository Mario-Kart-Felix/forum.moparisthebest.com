    <title>[Need] Webclient[317][MayPay]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-webclient-317-maypay/350634</link>
    <description>Well, I know their is a lot of people needing webclients. But I just can&#39;t figure it out.
I tried everything that I knew, do the best of my ability, so I feel that I got defeated.
This is my last resource. Can anyone out there get me a working, stable, good web client for my server, if its good enough, I may even pay up to 5.00. All I want is to get my server going. 




Thanks, 
Krowen.</description>
