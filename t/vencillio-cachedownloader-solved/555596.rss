[size=18pt]Here is the solution i have come up with .. if you go into Signlink.java, and search for  (  ./Cache/  ), without the parentheses, and change it to the name of your cache, and add c:/ instead of ./, then you will redirect the autodownloader to put a new cache in as an update. Sorry guys for the inconvenience of the large letters before. But i have fixed them. And i hope that this thread will help someone else in need of hekp on this particular code. Thanks, Have a great day! :)  ![/size]

              <p>Look the OP is still going to have the IOException because he has not touched the URL code. You can assume the NPE is because of the cache not loading or something but it will not have any direct affect on the OP issue since he’s solved his issue. Either way of it causes issues he can let us know.</p>

Are you serious?<br>
Try going to the url.</p>

<p>Edit:<br>
before you jump on the “omg but that’s not the nullpointer” well no shit it’s not. If you read my first reply, I was waiting on the OP to supply more information on the nullpointer.</p>

<p>you know, i was up all night at work this night and came home to find this error. I was really tired, and i could barely stay awake. Didnt realize that the font was so large.

I stated the problem i was having was that i cant get the cache to download, and go into the folder c:/users/Example/… so it is not downloading or its not looking in the right directory. but everytime i look through the code it still seems to be pointing in the right directory … Any help would be great.

<p>[size=18pt]Here is the solution i have come up with … if you go into Signlink.java, and search for  (  ./Cache/  ), without the parentheses, and change it to the name of your cache, and add c:/ instead of ./, then you will redirect the autodownloader to put a new cache in as an update. Sorry guys for the inconvenience of the large letters before. But i have fixed them. And i hope that this thread will help someone else in need of hekp on this particular code. Thanks, Have a great day! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  ![/size]</p>
