    <title>So anyone that is good with bytecode</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-anyone-that-is-good-with-bytecode/2918</link>
    <description>wanna hook up and try to work things out?

I got a few comparable classes/methods worked out to what they was named in the old deobs. Comparable as they have changed so much stuff around.

Of course I am going after the easy stuff first. Like the old signlink.getUID, signlink.findCacheDir etc.... IE The deadgivaways. :D 

Interesting...

Objects, and methods are being held in fields as well....

Getting an object array casting one of them in the array to a single class then casting that to a string as the arguement to reflect.getField to put that field into the array...

They do the same thing to get the class name to invoke getDeclaredMethod and the arguements for it...

Seems they got a much better toy to obfuscate with now.</description>

<p>hmmm, wonder what file just got opened there...  considering how the variable that got read in... was placed there by a(String , byte , int) method in the very same class this method is in as the path to the cache directory.</p>

<p>And it continues on just like before... they havent even touched the method in thier changes.</p>

<p>nd.m = uid ....<br>initilized to 0 in the constructor, set via the method I am talking about, and only referenced in one other place and I am sure we can all guess where that is.</p>

<p>Havent looked, but wouldn't be surprised a bit if ud.g leads to output stream somewhere lol, methods keep getting called at the end of the methods it goes down and quit looking after the second call. (what else could it possibly be...)</p>

<p>13 instances of that, 5 of those are going to be the menuaction&lt;&gt; arrays.	<br>Used to be only 11 arrays that size, AFAIK, menuActionName &lt;, and will a string type. Not sure what the ohters was before hand that was that size.</p>

<p>Dont look like thats a shortcut though. <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=3" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> ec class is holding a ton of strings... including what used to be menuaction name, still has those, but has alot others too.

<p>Encoded strings are now encoded to support ANY character set.</p>

<p>This encoding requires them to be transformed from the encoding to the local char-set before rendering etc can occur. Therefore jagex put them as static "ec" variables. Packages are collapsed therefore all of these strings become package level. And as such, package level fields can be moved to any class that is package level.</p>

<p>Sorry nerice and krich, your classes you have "identified", you've identified incorrectly.</p>

<p>One very, very, very, very noteable change is that with there obfuscator: Instead of putting the hashkey for methods "3214" in the exceptions, they now put "classname.methodname(arguments)" which is so much easier for us.</p>

<p>Nerice, haven't you heard of package level obfuscation?</p>

              <p>wanna hook up and try to work things out?</p>

<p>I got a few comparable classes/methods worked out to what they was named in the old deobs. Comparable as they have changed so much stuff around.</p>

<p>Of course I am going after the easy stuff first. Like the old signlink.getUID, signlink.findCacheDir etc.... IE The deadgivaways. <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> </p>

<p>Interesting...</p>

<p>Objects, and methods are being held in fields as well....</p>

<p>Getting an object array casting one of them in the array to a single class then casting that to a string as the arguement to reflect.getField to put that field into the array...</p>

<p>They do the same thing to get the class name to invoke getDeclaredMethod and the arguements for it...</p>

<p>Seems they got a much better toy to obfuscate with now.</p>
