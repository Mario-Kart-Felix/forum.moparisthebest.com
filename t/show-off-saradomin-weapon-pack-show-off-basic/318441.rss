    <title>[show off] saradomin weapon pack [show off] basic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/show-off-saradomin-weapon-pack-show-off-basic/318441</link>
    <description>  yea so, i havnt really had time for modeling anything, even though i just began ;]
       but i came up with this saradomin weapon pack (i spent like 30-40 minutes working on em through-out 3days)
    i know it&#39;s not good, i wanted it to be very basic, i used as little faces as i could test my skills, the shield has less then 60 faces  :eek:
 i mainly made this for my server that i&#39;m making, their just ment to be very basic stuff, i didnt bother adding to much detail, or making the edges curvy cause i know it wouldnt really make a difference in-game, well here they are, tell meh w/e th&#39; heck u wnana say x]
         and yes, unlick the acraain or w/e, i actually came up with these idea&#39;s myself, i&#39;ll probably still make the other rs gawds wep packs :]

well, here they are:

saradomin scimitar:

[IMG]http://i45.tinypic.com/2mobinp.jpg[/img]
i think it looks a bitlonger in this redner cause of the angle xD

saradomin twin daggers:

saradomin twin daggerby it&#39;s self:
[IMG]http://i47.tinypic.com/2d1v33q.jpg[/img]

saradomin shield:  (i know, the pic also has the sara scimitar in it =S  )
[IMG]http://i45.tinypic.com/29g0jkn.jpg[/img]

saradomin bow:      (i know it doesnt look the best, but i wanted to use as little faces as i could)
[IMG]http://i45.tinypic.com/mbnaft.jpg[/img]

this is some random scroll i made out of primitives (i got the idea from naruto when my little bro was watchin&#39; it):
[IMG]http://i49.tinypic.com/242wo6s.jpg[/img]

[IMG]http://i48.tinypic.com/296c2s5.jpg[/img]
and no, the pic at the back is not a penis xD, it&#39;s the word &quot;dragon&quot; in japanese (and no, i&#39;m not japanese O_o )
     i could do way better then this, well atleast i think i can, my dean razorback guitar is proof x]</description>

              <p>They’re ok. nothing amazing but they arent ‘shit’ as i know eventually someone will say. why would you try and use as few faces as possible? i mean, yea for rs low poly is good, but you should always go for only using as many as you need to make the model work, not as few as possible. theyre good V1 models and if you make V2 im sure theyd be less rough.</p>
