    <title>Adding music to a client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-music-to-a-client/283970</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not all that familiar with clients, but I&#39;m attempting to make one.

Here&#39;s what I need help with...

1. Adding Mp3&#39;s that can only be played from my MP3 file
2. Adding a live radio into it.

If anyone knows please tell :)</description>

              <p>Well, to add MP3 format music to a client, you just go into ‘User’ and then into "Music’ in your client files. There might be music in that folder already, if so, delete them if you don’t want them, and then just put your own music into that folder… But the music you put in has to be MP3 or MIDI format, or else your client won’t recognize them. And if someone downloads your client, the music you added will play for them. But nothing stops them from deleting those songs…</p>
<p>And I don’t know how to add a radio to a client, it would surely be possible, though.</p>
<p>Hope I answered what you wanted me to ^^</p>
