    <title>Noting items in bank</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/noting-items-in-bank/457104</link>
    <description>When I put a noted item into a bank, it un-notes it. Fair enough that&#39;s kinda useful. But when I click &quot;note&quot; and try to take it out noted again, it won&#39;t note.

This happens with ALL items. Potions, food, armour, the lot.

Any ideas on how to fix this?</description>
