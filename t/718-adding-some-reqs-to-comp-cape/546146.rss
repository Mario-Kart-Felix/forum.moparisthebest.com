    <title>718 adding some req&#39;s to comp cape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-adding-some-reqs-to-comp-cape/546146</link>
    <description>Ok so, I changed a few requirements for the untrimmed comp cape, but now i want to add some requirements for a trimmed comp cape, which i want some of the req&#39;s to be:

Be on extreme difficulty
have 100 pvp kills
be prestige 5
kill every gwd boss 100 times
and then have all of the achievements done.

So basically, I dont know what the code for each of the things i want is, but i know it would be like

[CODE]			if(!player.is100pvpkills()) {
				player.getPackets().sendGameMessage(&quot;You need to have at least 100 pvp kills to use this cape.&quot;);
				return false;
			}[/CODE]

But I have no idea where i would get the first method &quot;if(!player.******())&quot;

So if someone could tell me where i could find the methods, that would be greately appreciated.
I dont know if any of this post made sence, but i hope it did.

Thanks!</description>

              <p>There’s a few ways you can go about doing this.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">I’m not experienced with 718 protocol, packaging, naming, or etc. Do not expect my code to be accurate, it’s examples</span></p>
<p>For the pk points, I assume you have a variable for that already.</p>
<p><code>if(player.getPkPoints() &lt; 100) {
     player.getPackets().sendGameMessage("You need to have at least 100 pvp kills to use this cape.");
     return false;
}</code></p>
<p>for prestige:</p>
<p><code>if(player.getPrestigeRank() &lt; 5) {
     player.getPackets().sendGameMessage("You need to be at least prestige level 5 to use this cape.");
     return false;
}</code></p>
<p>for gwd you will want to add 4 variables, 1 for each boss. Then you can do something like:</p>
<p><code>if(player.getZamorakKills() &lt; 100 || player.getArmadylKills() &lt; 100 || player.getBandosKills() &lt; 100 ||  || player.getSaradominKills() &lt; 100) {
     player.getPackets().sendGameMessage("You need to kill each GWD boss 100 times to wear this cape.");
     return false;
}</code></p>
<p>And then idk how you do your achievements… but lets assume 512 achievement points is 100% completion.</p>
<p><code>
if(player.getAchievements() &lt; 512) {
     player.getPackets().sendGameMessage("You must finish all achievements to wear this cape.");
     return false;
}</code></p>
<p>Put em all together and you’ve got what you want.</p>
