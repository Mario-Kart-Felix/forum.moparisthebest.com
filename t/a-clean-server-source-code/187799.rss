    <title>A clean server source code</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-clean-server-source-code/187799</link>
    <description>I have followed the guides. made a local server to play runescape. i played it at miniclip but since it was always asking for membership.. i decided to make a server fr myself to play.

I have downloaded many source codes made available here but i must say, that i have had problems with all of them.

1)many of them dont let me open the doors( i cant enter buildings nor can i get out to a fresher place to kill monsters)

2) i dont get any initial gold coins or equips to play.( i cant as much as chop wood to make fire, etc).

3) some of them have given me terrible bugs and i was forced to close the client.


I have downloaded JDK 1.6(the latest version)
I have loaded the client provided here as well.

Can someone help me and provide me with a link to the source code which will be useful to me so that i can play?

Thank you.</description>

<p>bro. to code it.i need to first play runescape and understand it. i really dont have any idea regarding it. i played it from <a href="http://miniclip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">miniclip.com</a> and i was attracted to the game badly since it offered some good features than ragnarok but i didnt have access to the rangers equiments which i wanted to use badly.<br>
i dont have any idea about the classes, where to find items etc. thats the reason i wanna play it first and then start adding codes myself.</p>

              <p>yep.<br>
u were right in telling i donno about runescape.<br>
I have played ragnarok and had hosted my own server for sometime with my friends:)</p>
<p>I just want to host runescape and play it.<br>
Just like ragnarok i feel that, here i can have monsters to level up and then switch classes, get gears etc. something that of in miniclip.<br>
just want a source code that lets me host a server and play it instead of going through the process of coding.<br>
I need to go a long way to do coding since i donno runescape completely nor played it more than 2 days.<br>
I was frustrated with miniclip asking for membership and thats the reason i want to get a source code and play the game first after which i can do coding myself.<br>
I have done my courses of c,java and dotnet.</p>

<p>The point in coding a server isnt to play on your own, but actually make things work, educate yourself etc.</p>
<p>Eg. for doors, try making cases…lol</p>
<p>If you really just want to play a game like runescape, which is so much easier, faster xp etc then try Dodian, or alternatively if you just want to get aweseome runescape items for free etc Try frugooscape, that server has dragon full helm etc (jagex items)</p>
<p>If you seriously want a source close to runescape to play on your own, you probably cannot, unless you make your own.</p>
<p>You sound like you don’t really know anything about coding, so try frugooscape, dodian or go to the moparscape server status and try some of them.</p>
<p>Good luck :S</p>
