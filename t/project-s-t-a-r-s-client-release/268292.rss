    <description>Hello guys, I&#39;m Redfield. I&#39;m back with a new client, and ready to blow you away with this one. The last project I did, was just a staler. It was basically a demo. A test for the Actual project. I caught a few flaws with the old one, and I realized the source I was using, offered very little. So in this one, I changed ALOT more.

I know I said I was going to make a V2, but im not. I&#39;m going to work on a server next! :) It will probably be a figment source.

______________
Credits
______________

To Braiton from silabsoft forums.
His base for chosen angels

Pur3pkftw (Also from silabforums)
He gave me the codes for the green Frame.

And me. :)

Let&#39;s get started!

  PROJECT S.T.A.R.S By Redfield.
_____________________________________________________

If you people saw my first client, you will know im a fan of the Resident evil series. The &#39;big&#39; Police department was S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.) Chris Redfield was the leader. (Hinting at my name...)
 

 lets get to the pictures.

 Some cool game frame. The colors are stars colors. Also, the inventory picture is the stars logo badge.

Thats the title screen. It works well with the plain white background, and the badge. Looks good eh?

________________________________
Features for the client
________________________________

 Braiton had 3 songs in there. I took out all 3, and put in 1. Whoop dat trick! Instrumentals. It&#39;s a really cool beat, but if you don&#39;t like it, you can replace it.

 It also use to auto connect to his server, and I changed to where it connects to you local-host IP. I really have nothing else other to say, other than enjoy! **PS-MORE PICS COMING SOON!**

I Added a Dark green Jframe. It used to be black.

<p>Yes i know, dragging an mp3 file into a folder is very hard. Using microsoft paint, to recolor the sprites is way too difficult, and changing what ip it connects to is way out of anybodies league, sorry i rate it -5/10</p>

<p>Actually no it didnt your not one to talk who leeches everything he touches. There wasnt a gameframe It was just the plain old blue one. So instead of saying stuff you dont know, why dont you Download it and try it, before you judge it.</p>

              <p>Hello guys, I’m Redfield. I’m back with a new client, and ready to blow you away with this one. The last project I did, was just a staler. It was basically a demo. A test for the Actual project. I caught a few flaws with the old one, and I realized the source I was using, offered very little. So in this one, I changed ALOT more.</p>
<p>I know I said I was going to make a V2, but im not. I’m going to work on a server next! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> It will probably be a figment source.</p>
<hr>
<p>Credits</p>
<hr>
<p>To Braiton from silabsoft forums.<br>
His base for chosen angels</p>
<p>Pur3pkftw (Also from silabforums)<br>
He gave me the codes for the green Frame.</p>
<p>And me. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<hr>
<p>PROJECT S.T.A.R.S By Redfield.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you people saw my first client, you will know im a fan of the Resident evil series. The ‘big’ Police department was S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad.) Chris Redfield was the leader. (Hinting at my name…)</p>
<p>lets get to the pictures.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i41.tinypic.com/2vt9x6h.jpg" title="2vt9x6h.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/2vt9x6h.jpg" alt width="690" height="453"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">2vt9x6h.jpg</span><span class="informations">765×503</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Some cool game frame. The colors are stars colors. Also, the inventory picture is the stars logo badge.</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i43.tinypic.com/2zz5539.jpg" title="2zz5539.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/2zz5539.jpg" alt width="690" height="453"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">2zz5539.jpg</span><span class="informations">765×503</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>Thats the title screen. It works well with the plain white background, and the badge. Looks good eh?</p>
<hr>
<p>Features for the client</p>
<hr>
<p>Braiton had 3 songs in there. I took out all 3, and put in 1. Whoop dat trick! Instrumentals. It’s a really cool beat, but if you don’t like it, you can replace it.</p>
<p>It also use to auto connect to his server, and I changed to where it connects to you local-host IP. I really have nothing else other to say, other than enjoy! <strong>PS-MORE PICS COMING SOON!</strong></p>
<p>I Added a Dark green Jframe. It used to be black.</p>
