    <title>Russia and Qatar get 2018 and 2022</title>

    <description>What are your views on this?

Naturally disappointed that England didn&#39;t get 2018 but I must admit that Russia were favourites after their presentation and clean bid while there was way too much controversy in England&#39;s bid.

I really expected Australia to do slightly better than obtaining just 1 vote from the 22 FIFA officials but Qatar basically won in the 1st round of voting. The Qatari presentation basically won it for them but I don&#39;t really support the decision that FIFA made to send it to Qatar anyway. First of all, it has a population of just 1.5 million and only about one-sixth of that population is made up of people actually born in Qatar, the rest are all people who have migrated to Qatar to support their workforce. Secondly, Qatar has never qualified for the World Cup. Thirdly, regardless of the air conditioned stadiums that were proposed, the 50 degree desert heat is going to be a bitch. I mean, it&#39;s not going to be air conditioned outside is it? Finally, no alcohol! What is this? You could list negatives from the other bids but IMO these negatives outweigh those of the other countries. I guess the riches basically won it for them. Bit ridiculous.</description>

              <p>Wait, if they play in the months of June and July which normally are the months that the World Cup is played in then the temperature will be around the high 40’s or low 50’s but if they play in the months around January then the temperature will actually be around 25 or 30 on average but that will mean that the whole tournament is going to clash with the various national football leagues if they end up doing it so a huge problem may be reduced if FIFA allow the tournament to be rescheduled which I think they may end up doing.</p>

I’d prefer them to have it than a small country, for the reasons stated above. Qatar isn’t going to recoup their spendings through tourism. At least the UAE has so much money that it isn’t funny.</p>

<p>Say that to the South Africans.</p>
<p>I’m happy the Netherlands didn’t get it. Stupid prestige projects, football clubs are on the brink of bankruptcy, and we have laws that state that (local) governments don’t use tax money to fund the clubs, and then we want the World Cup? We only have 1 stadium that meets the requirements, but they wanted to replace it nonetheless.</p>

<p>They’re going to be up in their neck in it, and the citizens won’t know what hit them. :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Besides, I wouldn’t say what I said above without reason. You should know that, despite it not being obvious, large sporting events usually leave the host country in debt. Wouldn’t be surprised if Australia is still paying for the olympics we held in 2000 in one way or another, even if it boils down to having sporting facilities that aren’t used enough to justify their existence.</p>

              <p>Thing is that those massive figures that they cite as a benefit don’t outweigh the spendings, which are almost always made. Increased training expenses, increased maintenance of already maintained fields. Whatever.<br>
Basically Australia, at least, gets penis envy. We have an inferiority complex when it comes to America and Britain, just in case you haven’t noticed. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> So we spend stupidly and come out in the red.</p>
<p>Say we were to build a new training facility – just because. The opportunity cost of this could be a new medical clinic. That’s it though, done and dusted; if you put a sports facility there then you can’t put a medical clinic there too.<br>
And trust me, Australia needs the medical clinic more.</p>
<p>Qatar would have been better keeping their noses clean of it for sure. How is a country of 1.5 million going to handle the influx of people that the world cup brings? Sydney pretty much broke down when the pope came here a year or two ago for world youth day, and I bet there’s more infrastructure in Sydney.<br>
In my opinion, the absolute best-case outcome for them is to break even. Worst case, and much more likely, they’ll be paying out the arse for years to come.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Hosting the world cup or olympics is like having a hundred-strong new year’s eve party at your residential property with guests that are 16 - 18 years old.<br>
A couple of fuckwits get drunk, break all of your shit, and you wake up in the morning having had a ‘magical’ experience that may cost you thousands.</p>
<p>Oh, and a new year’s day hangover.</p>

<p>The last thing Australia needs is another money sink to piss taxpayer money into, so I’m glad that there’s little confidence in an Australian world cup.</p>

</aside>
<p>People want the World cup for the economic benefits, there was around £4billion being projected that it would bring in to the economy. So it isn’t really a bad thing in regards to the tax payer, unless you’re creating an entire infrastructure from scratch, like Russia is.</p>
<p>But clearly, money for either Fifa or the country wasn’t their main intention when picking the countries. They’ve picked Qatar and Russia because they want a something that will hopefully expand the fan base, picking England would have earned Fifa more money, but you’ll always have football fans in England, it is the other countries they need to work on securing.</p>

              <p>What are your views on this?</p>
<p>Naturally disappointed that England didn’t get 2018 but I must admit that Russia were favourites after their presentation and clean bid while there was way too much controversy in England’s bid.</p>
<p>I really expected Australia to do slightly better than obtaining just 1 vote from the 22 FIFA officials but Qatar basically won in the 1st round of voting. The Qatari presentation basically won it for them but I don’t really support the decision that FIFA made to send it to Qatar anyway. First of all, it has a population of just 1.5 million and only about one-sixth of that population is made up of people actually born in Qatar, the rest are all people who have migrated to Qatar to support their workforce. Secondly, Qatar has never qualified for the World Cup. Thirdly, regardless of the air conditioned stadiums that were proposed, the 50 degree desert heat is going to be a bitch. I mean, it’s not going to be air conditioned outside is it? Finally, no alcohol! What is this? You could list negatives from the other bids but IMO these negatives outweigh those of the other countries. I guess the riches basically won it for them. Bit ridiculous.</p>
