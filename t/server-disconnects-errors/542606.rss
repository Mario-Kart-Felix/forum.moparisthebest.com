    <title>Server Disconnects / Errors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-disconnects-errors/542606</link>
    <description>Hello, I have been running a server for a while and had to shut it down. 
3 months go by and I decide to start it up again, and now every so often (1minute-1hr) the server either:
-Logs everyone off
-Makes it so you cant move

I was wondering if there is any bad code in ZenithSCape or if my internet connection has a problem?

Sorry that I dont have a lot to give, but I don&#39;t know anything or any reason that is causing this.</description>

              <p>Is it being hosted on a VPS/dedicated server? Or are you hosting it on your own computer? If it’s your own computer, it could just be internet problems, or maybe try running less applications when hosting your server.</p>
