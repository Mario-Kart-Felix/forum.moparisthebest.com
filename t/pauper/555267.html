<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Before we get started, I’d like to brush you all up on what Pauper’s all about. I wanted to create a special kind of economy server. Not one of those ordinary ones that mainstream-type servers claim to be - no, no, those are too easy for my taste. I’m hoping to reach out to anyone who feels the same as I do. What’s missing in the RuneScape private server community is a challenging server, one that you can actually enjoy. I intend to bring you this server, under the name of Pauper. This server will have hours upon hours of gameplay availability. I know this, for I already have roughly 80 hours of gameplay at the time of making this thread. I hope that you guys come and check out Pauper!</p>
<p>Pauper’s development began on March 9th, and was planned out extensively for three days beforehand. Why this has taken me so long to conceive was because this was a special project for me. Now, for any of you whom may still remember, you may want to bring up EcoPS. However, consider this the revamped, completed version of that server. When EcoPS was in beta stage, on it’s initial release, it was that in equivalence to Pauper’s last three weeks of alpha stage. Now, I won’t go onto say how it’s perfect, the server still needs quite a bit of work. However, the server is indefinitely a playable, enjoyable server. Momentarily, there is no means of voting (as we are not on any toplists yet), and there is no means of donations (though I do have a plan for them).</p>
<p>Pauper underwent some rather serious development for a time-span of almost two months. Most of these things were revamping an entire source, so there were virtually no leftover remains; so I could build Pauper around an almost empty environment. However, there were a fair amount of pretty significant updates on my behalf, but nothing too extravagant. This server was mostly designed for it’s simplicity, enjoyability, and ableness to consistently provide achievements for players.</p>
<p>During the development process, an ‘alpha stage’ was held. There was a small community of around 5-7 players, helping with the server’s testing process. The fortunate bunch that were online during these stages got access to the alpha forums, of where I had discussed future plans, helped get ideas, and had bugs reported to me. And for their good fortune, I had rewarded them with a title of ‘Alpha Tester’. There will also be one for the beta testers as well. So, as long as you have an account created during the beta stages, which is ongoing right now, you will have access to the ‘Beta Tester’ title. This thread will be updated once we reach the public stage.</p>
