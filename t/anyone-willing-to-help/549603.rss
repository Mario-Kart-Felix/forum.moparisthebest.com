    <description>Hey is anyone willing to help me with gettting my server online? I&#39;ve done all the basic steps. I&#39;ve portforwarded my ip, I&#39;ve made a no-ip server and it wont let the friends I&#39;ve sent it to connect.
I&#39;m looking for some help on here or if anyone is willing to come on skype or mumble or teamlink or whatever.</description>

<p>go into your security for me its mcAfee what you have to do is once your in you what ever you have click on firewall then click on add program then turn on all the java programs to let connections go in and out though that program.</p>
<p>then there should be a port thing too youll have to add your rsps port into it then restart duc then run your server/s then it should work.</p>

              <p>There is a rather large amount of tutorials on how to set up a server on these forums. Try looking there first.</p>
