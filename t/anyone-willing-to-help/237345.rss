              <p>well, for a start you should get a new banner.<br>
Also if i were you i would have a shorter domain, that is somewhat easier to remember.</p>
<p>I suppose you are trying to make a site kinda like tip.it or runehq, in that case you will have to add something that they do not have, because no one will bother coming to your site if you just provide them whit exactly the same shit.<br>
So try to come up whit stuff that they do not cover or offer. Maybe a site devoted to guides on how to defeat various monsters. i know tip.it have some of those, but last time i checked it was only around 3 or 4 guides. And there are already TONS of sites whit different money making guides/tips, so i will not suggest to have that unless is some really good tips.</p>

you should redesign the whole thing.</p>
<blockquote>Runescape is very different than real life (obviously). In runescape, you will find that whatever you say will not be taken seriously at first. If you ask someone to be your runescape friend, they might assume you?re a moocher and only talking because you?re after their runescape items.</blockquote> lol wut?
