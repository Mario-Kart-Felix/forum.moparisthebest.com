[size=20pt]Advertising[/size]

Q:Can I Get Viruses From Playing Runescape?
A:No, You can&#39;t get viruses from playing runescape.

Q:Do Runescape adverts affect the performance of RuneScape?  
A:Performance reduction is caused by a number of different factors. In some cases older computers can struggle to show very complex adverts whilst running RuneScape.

Q:How do I remove adverts from RuneScape?
A:By paying a monthly subscription fee and becoming a member, your game will be advert free. Please remember that intentionally blocking the adverts by another method is against Rule 15 of the Rules of Conduct and can result in action being taken against your account.

Q:Why is there adverts on Runescape?
A:Advertising is a very effective way for them to ensure that you can continue to offer the free-to-play version of RuneScape as they pay for the servers and the support needed to keep the game running.

[size=20pt]Ban &amp; Mutes[/size]

Q:How do I appeal my offence/ban?
A:If your account has been permanently banned and you believe that you have a reason as to why your account should not be banned that they are unaware of, then you can appeal individual offences by logging in to Account Recovery from the main page.

Q:How do I appeal my offence/mute?
A:If you have been permanently muted and believe that your mute is not justified then you can appeal individual offences by logging in to Account Recovery from the main page.

Q:What are black marks and what do they mean?
A:Black marks are Jagex&#39;s way of keeping track of how an account is behaving in the game.

Black marks are earned for breaking the Rules of Conduct and the number of marks given is dependent on the severity of the offence.

Each time you gain a black mark you will be informed of this by Inbox message so please check here before sending a query to Customer Support asking why you were given them.

If the number of black marks on your account reach a certain level, your account will be removed from the game. Black marks may be added individually or multiple marks may be added for more severe offences.

Q:Why have I been banned or muted?
A:If you have been banned or muted either permanently or temporarily then you will be able to see this when you log in to Account Management from the main page.

Q:Why is my account locked?
A:If they suspect that someone other than the original owner has access to an account then they will lock the account to ensure that none of the items on the account are stolen and it is not used to break the Rules of Conduct. If you indicate that someone else has used your account when appealing an offence your account will also be locked.

[size=20pt]Other[/size]

Q:Are clans an official part of the game?
A:They do not recognise Clans as a part of the game although we realise that being part of a team can be an enjoyable and game enriching experience especially when you want to play with a group of similarly minded friends. We have, therefore, provided items such as team based mini-games, wilderness capes and space on the forum so that players can organise themselves into these groups should they wish to.

Q:I have lost items in the game. Can I get them back?
A:There policy is, unfortunately, to never return lost items since doing so just encourages users to claim lost items they never had in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players.

There trade system is very secure so if you have lost items through a trade scam we suggest you check out there anti-scamming guide in order for you avoid being scammed in the future.

Q:I died, what happens now?
A:When you die a number of different things can happen depending on what you were doing before you died.

If you died while just questing normally then you will lose all of your items but the three of highest value

If you died after gaining a skull in the Wilderness then you will not keep any of your items.

If you had the Protect Item prayer active when you died you will keep one more item than you would have in either of the cases above so either 4 or 1 respectively.

Lastly, if you died while in certain combat mini-games you will not have lost any items but will be teleported back to the beginning of the mini-game with no penalty other than the loss of your progress.

If I forgot anything just post it or pm me
