              <p>I have many free templates out there bud, I’m sure one would come in handy. I’m finishing up a new one at the moment so if you’d like to wait for that release you can. I’m not going to advertise where I have the templates because I feel that is in bad taste, I’m sure if you snoop around the web dev section you will find what I have released.

No. There is no webclient for specifically a PI <span class="bbcode-b">server</span>. There are only webclients for <span class="bbcode-b">clients</span> and PI is not a client, it is a server. Rephrase your question and I’ll help you.<br>

LOL someone’s got a bug up there ass huh? Dude you wouldn’t help him even if he rephrased what he typed and you know it. You know what he wants and you know what he’s trying to type. Stop being a dick and actually help him. If not, come back when you don’t have a bee up your ass and don’t have an attitude. Thanks! (:<br>
As for this…if you have a jar made up for your webclient page just search on google “Ric’s Webclient Tutorial” and take the webclient page off that.</p>
<p>P.S. 3lv3n snip3r…Don’t you even think to respond to this as you won’t get another answer. Once again you wouldn’t even help him if he did what you said so just stop acting like you know what you’re talking about. Thanks again! (:[/quote]<br>
You obviously don’t know me and flaming at me will not help your cause. I would help him if he rephrases his question because, there is no such thing as a webclient for PI. So, basically, he’s asking for something that doesn’t exist. I’m not being a dick, I’m telling him the truth. Also, I do know what I’m talking about and, you don’t know me and what I’m capable of doing. If you really wish to test me about my knowledge about Java and HTML, please look up what I’ve done in the past. Before you come here talking shit about someone, do your loveing research first. Also, you really think making a webclient is that hard and that I’m not capable of doing that? I can jar and sign a client and have it uploaded and have the webclient working properly within a few minutes.</p>
<p>P.S. You’re obviously new to MoparScape and saying shit like that will start something. I’ve responded to your post, your move now.</p>
<p>Edit: If you still don’t think I’ll help people, check out how many posts I’ve made in the Server Help section compared to the rest of the sections. I do help people if they cooperate with me.</p>
