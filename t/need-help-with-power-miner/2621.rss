    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-power-miner/2621</link>
    <description> powerminer with banking and walkback, should be mostly working
  make a text file in Configs/ called paths.txt
  in there, an entry 0=x1,y1,x2,y2,xn,yn
  the path needs to start at mine and end at bank
  specify multiple paths with the path= argument

  walkback is untested

  usage: /powerMiner([optional bank,][optional walkback,][optional path=int,]id1,id2,idn)
