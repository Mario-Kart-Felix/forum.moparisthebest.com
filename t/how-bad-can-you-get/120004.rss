    <title>How bad can you get</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-bad-can-you-get/120004</link>
    <description>Well, last night, around 12 AM Central USA time, I was browsing MoparScape-Help forums, and I find all these posers on the site, and then a bunch of gay porn being posted all over. So I talk to Metal about it, and this is what he said..

[quote=&quot;Mod Metal&quot;]im getting rid of all the fucking spam and gay porn posts from last night.. newb&#39;s not really sure how to do his job apperentally[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Mod Metal&quot;]that was actually lothy on moparisthebest.com... they are jealous that our site is better then mopar now that they fucked it up..[/quote]
Look at that.. Lothy has been posting gay porn all over. What&#39;s the point of trying to ruin this site? You guys pruned for a reason, to keep all the noob tutorials out, and now MoparScape-Help has all the tutorials that people ask about, so you resort to being complete perverts.</description>
