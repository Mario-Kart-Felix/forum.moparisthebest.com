    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-update-of-stupid3ooos-powerminer/10151</link>
    <description>Wow, I remember autoing with this way back when. It&#39;s completely out of date now, due larely to the May engine update. I would [i][u][b]hugely[/b][/u][/i] appreciate it if someone could revamp the script (it was very lag-free) , possibly throw out the old and include SRL anti-random procedures. I&#39;d be willing to pay $13 USD. Thanks! I&#39;ll include a text file of the Powerminer.</description>
