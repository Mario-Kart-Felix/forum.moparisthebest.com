              <p>i didnt just copy and paste it, i added the exit at the end, didnt work. there was another line that i added that made it say cannot find specified path but it would still run. other then those 2 there it was all the same exept for the line where it runs from and when i tried adding that it said cannot find path specified and closed instantly without running client. those were the only things diff.</p>

              <p>in the run batch code, usually at the end it will say pause if it stays, try replacing that with something like “exit” without the quotes, or something like that i cant remember, and it should work, if that doesnt work, study other clients run batch code which the “black box” as you say exits, and see whats different from your run batch code.</p>
<p>P.S. its called a CMD or command prompt.</p>
