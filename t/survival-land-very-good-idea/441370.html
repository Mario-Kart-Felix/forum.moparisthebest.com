        <p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Background:</span></span> The age of exploration in a seemingly ever expansive land. The world is flat, or is it? Every body who enters into this Realm takes on the task of exploring vast wild lands.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Sea Voyage</span></span>: You must work in the city to make money. Survival is key for you at this point and you just cant wait to continue your journey. The people keep their own lifestyles and have their own abilities in town. You would be wise to bring a doctor with you and maybe a person who knows about plants.  You can work together as a crew(with other players) or command your own crew of town hirelings(NPC’s). Setting sail with simple tactics. You can acquire treasures beyond your dreams on your journeys and even happen upon a sunken ship. Though this wreckage is scattered with great treasure, what made it sink? You best be on the look out in these treacherous seas! The world is full of lands to claim and explore scattered through out the realm. They all are whittled with their own types of resources goodies and surprises. There will be weather patterns that turn nasty at times and require shelter from their power. Unless you are apt in your abilities to take the storm on head on you best be near land at these times. There would be up to an 8-man crew on a ship.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">Land Voyage</span></span>: You start out in a Port-side city. You work from a very young age and have very little money. You can start off from the beginning and begin your journey or make a few acquaintances first. You have many different options as to what you want to do on your journey, but of course you can do them all!(mainly survival skills) You may even opt to go with a sea crew in order to find new places to explore and things to discover.</p>
<p>The skills:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Voyager</span>-Controls your ability to get around, the higher your skill, the faster methods of travel available to you. Horses, ships, boats, horse N’ buggy, or walking.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Herbalist</span>-Your knowledge about plants, you know what plants can be eaten and which ones cannot. Your life is a learning experience full of stupid decisions ;D (You have to find out what it does somehow!) You develop a good immunity from diseases though.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Farmer</span>- self explanatory, BUT… it allows you to plant certain crops in the ground(hopefully). It also has to do with tree’s and seeds. The ability to find seeds is based on your skill as well. Experienced farmers have no trouble surviving.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Survivalist</span>-Your ability to, you guessed it, survive. This controls everything from starting fires to spotting fresh water. Would be more “hidden” type of skill because it would be the player(you) to notice hazards to drinking water rather than the character. You know how to light a fire.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Herder</span>-You use animals as your main way of life. You get milk from your cows/goats and you herd them though the lands looking for food. You would have a source of meat but your animals are prone to natural dangers and running off if you do not keep them pinned up at night. Your live stocks survival relies on your abilities to make fences so you are someone who needs to be good with making fences.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Builder</span>-Ability to build things. You can create great structures or little rickety shacks. The area around you depicts what you can use to build. If the area is full of trees you can make wooden structures like fences(to keep your animals in), cottages(long time to build), teepee’s(if you have animal hides), or make simple repairs to anything you own(ships, house/cottage, ETC.) IF you are really good at this skill people in towns will hire you.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Craftsman</span>- You are good with making tools. You build better quality fences with this ability(they have a stronger durability), You build tools and weapons with this. The higher the skill, the more “useful” your tools can be. You start out making wooden spears and anything simple, this turns into Hammers, hatchets, bows n arrows, any other more intricate designs.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Hunter</span>-You can catch and kill your own food. Definitely would not be the main focus of the game. Hunting would be pretty simple, making traps or Using a bow for deer, wild pigs. (not sure if guns would be introduced, as it is an exploration game)</p>
<p>The Game: while traveling you may come across wild animals. You can encounter NPC farmers and herders through out the lands. Staying on the good side of the law would be to your advantage. You can work at random peoples houses for Karma+. This will lead to you being seen as a good person and allowed more privileges within their homes and such. They can offer you shelter for the night, or a place to keep your animals(if their home permits it).</p>
<p>any other idea’s for skills let me know.</p>
<p>I have a lot more in my head though it seems rather difficult to explain it all D:</p>

        <p>A few minor changes and this would be dead on a One Piece game I built a while back in java for a few friends of mine,</p>
<p>I think you pretty much nailed it for a good story, simple and yet hugely flexible, that is what you want, is this something you are thinking about building? And another thing, is this a sandbox style game like The elder scrolls series or follow a more restricted story to adventure scenario like the monster hunter tri game?</p>
