    <title>Creating my own items (looks) and other problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-my-own-items-looks-and-other-problem/160741</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve posted this many times..I just want a tutorial :)

Can I make my own items, or at least change the way an item looks. Not the color, the entire tihng liek shape etc.

Also, when I DL servers, and try to edit the server, it opens in notepad, and is just a bunch of weird symbols. I tried opening in it in a few other programs, none of it works though.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 25, 2007, 04:02:53 PM[/size][hr]13 views 0 replies. o fun</description>
