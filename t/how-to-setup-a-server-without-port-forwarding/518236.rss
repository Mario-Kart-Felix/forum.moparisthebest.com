    <title>How to setup a server without port forwarding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-setup-a-server-without-port-forwarding/518236</link>
    <description>Now I have a .webs.com website and would like to let my friends test out and see what they think, so I tried to follow the steps of port forwarding the server, yet I have no clue what the password is and I don&#39;t think my dad will approve &lt;.&lt; ..

So I&#39;m asking is there a way without port forwarding the server and have a website do all for me?  If so can someone direct to a tut or just give me the site that can do for me...I&#39;m not afraid of paying a little money for the service if the website requires it.</description>
