    <description>I have almost almost done making my mini game in my server. All i need to know is how to not lose all your items when you die in the game and teleport to a set spot, how to save points when people log off both overall and current points, and how to make it so people dont see each other and are able to attack the monster without needing to wait, and for a future idea how may i go about making a game similar to pest control with like 5 people on a team fighting a bunch of monsters. Please help, thank you.</description>
