        <p>omfg lol. another clinton promoter. plz don’t say you’d vote for hilary.</p>
<p>anyway… here’s your “list” and after ea section’s ~~ is my comments<br>
Bush started the Iraq war - CIA told him 2 weeks before he attacked, there WAS NO FUCKING WEAPONS O FMASS DESTRUCTION THERE~~ and what proof do you have of this? I’m 99% sure that if something was said like this it would have been vague not “omfg saddam is an angel and has absolutely no weapons”. what most dipshits tend to do is forget what ACTUALLY happened. Bush started the war because saddam wouldn’t let UN officials (notice UN, not even american) look for them. what would you think if your brother was always stealing stuff from you, then you confront him about it and he doesnt show you what he’s holding behind his back. you’d kick his ass untill he showed you right?(pretty good metaphore eh?) Bush even GAVE saddam a time limit to change his mind, and warned him that we would go to war if he didnt.</p>
<p>Bush is against Gay Rights &amp; abortion - asshole~~ personally i don’t care, but I do think it would cause problems in the long run nontheless. there’s a thing called a will. it meets most of what was mentioned as reasons to allow it besides “love”</p>
<p>Bush’s family is making money off the war since his daddy is a merchant of war (that means he’s in dealing with arms - he owns a few weapon companies)~~ whoopdy doo. check the lists buddy boy. his daddy isnt supplying much to the army, which means he isnt makeing a significant profit from the war. besides, all politicians have similar backrounds of family owning big buisnesses. how do you think Kerry got his money? Heinz baby(from his wife’s family).</p>
<p>Bush fucking put America in debt after 8 years of Bill Clinton helping the defecit. Bush came in, jerked off, spewed cum all over the United States and now we owe the rest of the world like 100 trillion something dollars because of king shit dubya mother fucker.~~omfg… seriously dude you have no idea do you? what does america produce? we import waaaaaaaaaaaay more then what we export, and then the gov pays welfare and ss in advance(which is total bullshit because it wasnt designed to do that. I’m pretty sure it was regan that opened it to that… which is the main cause for it’s failure). oh… and umm… hmm… lets see… maybe… umm… WARS COST MONEY YOU FUCKING MORONS. BESIDES, THE PROBLEM IS AMERICA’S ECONOMY. NOT JUST BUSH. when you think of Bush economicly, think of Louis XIV(fits the supposed dumbness and everything)</p>
<p>He lied about 911.~~ how could he not? the media egged him on enough about it. besides, if anyone is to blame it’s the CIA, not bush. nobody knew exactly why it happened at first anyway.<br>
He lied about the Iraq War~~ or did the media?<br>
He has an IQ of 12 while Bill Clinton had one of 211~~ bs<br>
He got shit grades when he went to school (proves how dumb the mother fucker is)~~ once again bs. nobody would have access to his grades anyway. this is all bs<br>
His election was bought thanks to another king shit, his dad. no, it was bought thanks to the pansy named kerry.</p>

        <p>He controls the media, his IQ isn’t bs, he did get shit grades and they did have access to it, you’re dumb and you don’t read the news. And argue about things you don’t know. And his election was bought, when did you come out of the hole?</p>
<p>Clinton was the best president. The only thing he did, the ONLY thing he did was get blowjobs from Monica Louinskee. He had so many positives, and is still doing great stuff today. With all his organizations and everything.</p>
<blockquote>Bush is against Gay Rights &amp; abortion - asshole~~ personally i don't care, but I do think it would cause problems in the long run nontheless. there's a thing called a will. it meets most of what was mentioned as reasons to allow it besides "love"</blockquote>
<p>I wish bush didn’t care, that would be one less problem out of 10,000.</p>
<p>And we do have a huge defecit! Man you don’t know anything. Do you know how much the United States owes the fucking world??? I bet you don’t read at all, pick up the NY times, read the news online. Do something, rather than talk about things you no completely zero of.</p>
<p>Sorry for being so brunt, I just hate when people argue about things they don’t know.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Ron, post:41, topic:2130”]Are you fucking kidding me doomsday!</p>
<p>1.Bush started the Iraq war - CIA told him 2 weeks before he attacked, there WAS NO FUCKING WEAPONS O FMASS DESTRUCTION THERE</p>
<p>2.Bush is against Gay Rights &amp; abortion - asshole</p>
<p>3.Bush’s family is making money off the war since his daddy is a merchant of war (that means he’s in dealing with arms - he owns a few weapon companies)</p>
<p>4.Bush fucking put America in debt after 8 years of Bill Clinton helping the defecit. Bush came in, jerked off, spewed cum all over the United States and now we owe the rest of the world like 100 trillion something dollars because of king shit dubya mother fucker.</p>
<p>5.He lied about 911.<br>
6.He lied about the Iraq War<br>
7.He has an IQ of 12 while Bill Clinton had one of 211<br>
8.He got shit grades when he went to school (proves how dumb the mother fucker is)<br>
9.His election was bought thanks to another king shit, his dad.[/quote]<br>

<p>1.That was just a cover, you see saddam killed 150k of his own people with posion gas, and since america is number one, its our job to take out a dictator, so bush was infact doing his job as president.</p>
<p>2.are u fucking gay??? gay people should not be allowed to marry or even exsist, humans where made to reproduce and gay people cant do that, and aborshion is killing a person before they can live, killing u is okay your a noob, but to kill a baby who hasnt even been able to breath yet??? its sick wrong, and low down shitty</p>
<p>3.so whats wrong with selling wepaons, it doesnt mean shit since its his dad and not him… and if i owned a weapon factory does that mean that bush is bad becasue of that?</p>
<p>4.CLINTON didnt do shit, he is the worst president we every had, and your a fucking noob for liking him, and also we have always been in dept, AMERICAS NATIONAL DEPT HAS BEEN IN THE TRILLIONS FOREVER</p>
<p>5.how the fuck did he lie about 911, 911 happend is there anyway to lie about something that you have video and physical evidence?</p>
<p>6.no, he said we where going to war, and we did…</p>
<p>7.YOUR A FUCKIGN BILL CLINTON LOVER! stupid pussy, clinton sucks, you should get shot for saying he was any good, and bush isnt very dumb(you are becasue you think he is)</p>
<p>8.how the fuck would you know his grades dumb ass, and bill didnt even finish hishscool, motherfucker</p>
<p>9.KERRY DROPPED OUT, how the fuck is that baught, kerry is a pussy ass bitch, who was afraid of being a loser and so he quit.</p>
<p>that is all AMERICA RULES, now stop fucking with us before i shoot you in the ass.[br][size=1]Posted at: May 06, 2006, 10:56:05 pm[/size][hr][quote=“Ron, post:47, topic:2130”]Our economy is crashing. We are at an all time low on the stock market. Ever flip the channel to CNBC or something? Our GDP can still be high, while we still owe a lot. United States withdrawals aren’t included in GDP. If you noticed, GDP excludes a lot of things. Didn’t you take economics yet?[/quote]</p>
<p>ron, ron, ron, your being so noobish right now, incase you dont know, where in debt and have been for hundreds of years… its not big news, that thing is we are the top country adn we will forever be, just face it you terroist prick, we own you</p>

lamo, it’s soooo true.</p>
<p>[quote=“Ron, post:43, topic:2130”]He controls the media, his IQ isn’t bs, he did get shit grades and they did have access to it, you’re dumb and you don’t read the news. And argue about things you don’t know. And his election was bought, when did you come out of the hole?</p>
<p>Clinton was the best president. The only thing he did, the ONLY thing he did was get blowjobs from Monica Louinskee. He had so many positives, and is still doing great stuff today. With all his organizations and everything.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Bush is against Gay Rights &amp; abortion - asshole~~ personally i don’t care, but I do think it would cause problems in the long run nontheless. there’s a thing called a will. it meets most of what was mentioned as reasons to allow it besides “love”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I wish bush didn’t care, that would be one less problem out of 10,000.</p>
<p>And we do have a huge defecit! Man you don’t know anything. Do you know how much the United States owes the fucking world??? I bet you don’t read at all, pick up the NY times, read the news online. Do something, rather than talk about things you no completely zero of.</p>
<p>Sorry for being so brunt, I just hate when people argue about things they don’t know.</p>
<p>~Ron[/quote]</p>
<p>~coudln’t have said your last line any better ron. you just discredited yourself=P I didnt say we didnt have a huge deficit for one, but it isnt all bush’s fault moron. we’ve had a huge debt just about FOREVER(no, not really, but for a long time). If he controlled the media things would be A LOT better. people just say thier crackpot feelings like it’s law because they can put what they think is 2 and 2 together when there’s a lot more involved. lol… bill clinton did a lot more then that buddy. and a major thing was SCREWING UP OUR TRADE REGULATIONS WITH CHINA AND NOW EVERYTHING IS MADE THERE. and no, his IQ isnt 12. find any significantly creditable source for this and i “might” change my mind.</p>

-- George W. Bush, in a June, 2001, letter to British students at Oakhill College in Lancashire, England: but giving the benefit where doubt is due, we ask, had they been Americans, wouldn't they already be citizens?
<blockquote>God told me to strike at al Qaida and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Do you have blacks, too?</blockquote>
-- George W. Bush, meeting with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso; allegedly, in this incident, reportedly witnessed only by members of the White House Press Corps, Condoleezza Rice was present and jumped in to save Cardoso from having to answer, informing Bush that in fact Brazil is home to more blacks than any country outside Africa
<blockquote>This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As young Americans, you have an important responsibility, which is to become good citizens.</blockquote>
-- George W. Bush, in a June, 2001, letter to British students at Oakhill College in Lancashire, England: but giving the benefit where doubt is due, we ask, had they been Americans, wouldn't they already be citizens?
[/noob]
<p>GOOD CITIZENS, noob, the guy that robs a bank is not a good citizen… whats your IQ 2?</p>
<blockquote>God told me to strike at al Qaida and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them.</blockquote>

        <p>not really u weakly tried to discredit three quotes</p>
<blockquote>Do you have blacks, too?</blockquote>
<p>Isn’t fact but certainly sounds like something he would say.</p>
<blockquote>As young Americans, you have an important responsibility, which is to become good citizens.</blockquote>
<p>Here you missed the point, the fact is that he wrote this to English students… last time I checked England wasn’t America</p>
<blockquote>God told me to strike at al Qaida and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them.</blockquote>
<p>HE DID SAY THIS, it was reported in an Israeli newspaper called Haaretz. The link to the article can be found here - <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=310788&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=310788&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y</a> [please delete if no linking allowed]</p>
<p>Next, you go on to discredit 14 facts with two weak sentences, lets analyse it closely</p>
<p>Doomsday: “they are all fact,” - SO YOU AGREE WITH ME?<br>
Doomsday: “facts are thing that are neccisarly true” - HMMM I’M NOT SO SURE, why don’t we look at the definition of FACT</p>
<p>Definitions:</p>
<p>An indisputable truth.<br>
Something that is known to have happened or to be true or to exist<br>
An actual event or a true statement.</p>
<p>Doomsday’s definition:</p>
<p>“facts are thing that are neccisarly true”</p>
<p>hmmmm, it seems that your knowledge of the word FACT and what it means is limited =P</p>
<p>Continuing…</p>
<p>Doomsday: “just can be proven true or false, wich they are all false” - well obviously this is impossible, just look at the definitions.</p>
<p>Yep, so if your gonna try and PWN me or watever u want to call it, you may want to create a stronger argument, rather than making up some random shit and calling me a noob</p>

        <blockquote>Do you have blacks, too?</blockquote>
<p>ISNT FACT, and no he wouldnt say that, its common sense, kerry did say that in his presidental speech to arizona…</p>
<blockquote>As young Americans, you have an important responsibility, which is to become good citizens.</blockquote>
<p>he never said as young americans,and still your comment(about if they where americans they would already be citizens) if tehy where citizins, like is the guy who shots an old lady for 5 buck, hes an american citizen but hes not a GOOD citizen.</p>
<blockquote>God told me to strike at al Qaida and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East. If you help me I will act, and if not, the elections will come and I will have to focus on them.</blockquote>
<p>congratz, your the next level of noobness, that news paper is a fake, how stupid do you think i am???</p>
<blockquote>*Responsible for a $521 billion budget deficit - less than 4 years after inheriting a $200 billion surplus. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>how is he responisble??? he didnt do anything but run the country, i swear you just wanna blame shit on him, the debit is infact casue by everyone, since we import more than we export, so we end up indebit(but we are the top country so we dont have to pay it back)</p>
<blockquote>*He pulled out of the Kyoto Agreement on Global Warming, which had been agreed upon by 178 other countries. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>no reaon wasting time, we can do alot better here in the us, than doing the shiting agreement, its all a matter of ability, instead of planning you should do what you can(or find a way)</p>
<blockquote>*He is on pace to have taken more vacation than any president in history - including a 28-day vacation right before 9/11. Bush Jr. has taken 6 months of vacation in total. [FACT]</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>how do you know it was a vactions, it could infact have been a secret mission to keep the peace(it could happen) we will never know, and also where do you get your facts, there so shady, next time do your homework</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>*Bush Jr. has set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest a leader (10 million people), shattering the record for protests against any person in the history of mankind. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>any prez could have done it too, all they had to do is create a war on a country, its becasue so many STUPID fuckers in the world including the us, would like to see 9/11 happen again and again, if the mother fuckers would actually know shit, then they would notice that terrioism hasnt had war yet, so they think, we can do what we want, but then we declared war, and we owned them, notice how come the us has yet to have a terroist attack since then?</p>
<blockquote>*Bush Jr. is the first president in US History to enter office with a criminal record. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>LIES, we have had 72 presidents with a criminal record, along with the well worship geoge washington, and even abe lincon, also teddy rosevelt(great prez) had been arrested 7 times!</p>
<blockquote>*To this day has not yet caught Osama. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>why hate him??? you didnt catch him, and no one else has, so that a stupid reason to hate him, that like blaming you for the sun being so hot…</p>
<blockquote>*First president in US History to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. Elections). [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>lie, again he did accept them and they did inspect the election, wich my infact be the reason for kerry quiting his election.</p>
<blockquote>*Responsible for an unemployment rate of 6%, there are now 9 million people out of work in America, 3.3 million more than when Bush took office. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>FUCK, how can you blame him for this??? he didnt do it, did you know the us population grow 25.3 million a year??? so how do you expect for 25.3 million people to get a job, i bet you cant even find a job, how do you expect someone who doesnt speak english</p>
<p>also american are lazy, bush isnt responsible for that…</p>
<blockquote>*For lying about WMD's in Iraq. To this day none have been found [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>again to this day, so what if we find them tomorrow, or what if saddam shiped them to another country??? or maybe even he destroyed them so bush would look bad… also the WMDs were just a cover for us to take out a dictator, saddam had been in office for 10 years and had killed 500,000 of his own people becasue they wouldnt wear yellow on tuesdays(and yet you hate bush)</p>
<blockquote>*Spent over 166 billion dollars to blow up two third world countries that posed no threat to us. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>it doesnt mean shit if they dont pose a threat to us(no country does) once again saddam is an evil dictator^^ and osama is a terroist that killed over 2,000 american citizens, so does that mean we cant do anything about that, if you ran the country we would just be walked all over by terroist and shit, since you would be like, oh you kill 500,000 people in new york, nice job mate, keep up the good work…</p>
<blockquote>*Has not attended one US soldierâ€™s funeral. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>once again lie, he has attended over 400 us soldiers in the past 2 years, and possibly his vacitions that he took, could have been to visit the families of the dead soldiers</p>
<blockquote>*The first net loss of jobs since Herbert Hoover. Yes, that Herbert Hoover from the Great Depression. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>you sound more noobish every time you type something, okay here we go, the us grows 27.3 million people a year, and since america is lazy and dont wanna work, bussiness go to other countries for people that will work harder for half the money, its not bushes fault, its YOUR FAULT, and everyone else that sits around blaming bush becasue they cant get a job, bush has no controll of this country, thats the senate, he just runs the military…</p>
<blockquote>*At the presidential conventions, protesters are to be cordoned off in cages with razor wire. These are referred to as â€œfree speech zonesâ€. [FACT]</blockquote>
<p>its for his protection, what if you knew that 50,000 americans who hated you(becasue their so stupid)<br>
wouldnt you ask for protection, or who you let them storm teh stage and kill you???</p>
<p>conclusion</p>
<p>YOU ARE A FUCKING LAZY ASS BUM, WHO BLAMES BUSH FOR YOUR PROBLEMS BECASUE YOUR TOO STUPID TO ADDMIT THAT YOU SUCK AT LIFE.</p>
