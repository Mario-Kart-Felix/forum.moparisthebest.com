    <title>Hey need help with co-owner and owner(Delta)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hey-need-help-with-co-owner-and-owner-delta/368221</link>
    <description>Hey all
So recently i decided to give my bestfriend(and administrator) co-owner. Thing is,i wanna make it clear that he is co and i am owner. So i was wondering what ways i could do this. Aside from simply telling people,i need to make a way to make it absolutely clear
I have changed starting mesage,::info all that,but i was wondering if there were more ways?
Also,i would like some better owner commands for my new co-owner to expierience. If someone could give me a ::kill command,that would be good,but it would be nice to have some more armour commands,maybe animations?
I know i should just work it out,but im just tryin to quickly do it to suprise my best mate (he dont know he is co-owner yet)and then he will be able to have fun with the commands.
Thanks
