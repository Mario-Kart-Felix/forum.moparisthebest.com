If you are anxious to get rid of your glasses or contacts, a new operative option may be the reply. It’s a corrective surgical procedure for nearsightedness that is similar to laser surgery, reports Surgeon Dr. Rose Gabriele of CBS News affiliate marketer WOIO-TV in Cleveland.Intacs, which are placed onto the non-seeing periphery of the cornea, were recently licensed by the Food and Drug Administration.The small band segments in the shape of half-circles are placed on the edge of the actual cornea to change its form, says Dr. Samuel Salamon of the Corrective Eye Center in Cleveland. Patients are shot with an anesthetic but remain awake with the surgery. Tiny incisions are made in the cornea to place the implants in every eye. The procedure will take approximately fifteen minutes.Research indicates that most patients possess 20/20 vision or greater with the implants. Yet, unlike other helpful procedures, the augmentations can be removed.“We can get rid of the segments, we can adjust them, we can replace them,” claims Salamon.Like most surgery, almost always there is a risk of problems, including infection. The expense of the procedure is almost the same as vision surgery – about $2,2 hundred for each eye.Those with mild to moderate nearsightedness may also benefit from the medical procedures.  <a href="http://judykeim.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://judykeim.com/</a><br>
