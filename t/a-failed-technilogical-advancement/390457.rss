    <title>A (failed) Technilogical Advancement</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-failed-technilogical-advancement/390457</link>
    <description>Before my router broke last week, it was the fastest and best router I have ever had. When I ordered a new one, from the same company, they shipped one for 90$; The router was supposed to be &#39;faster&#39; and &#39;better&#39; than the previous one was.

After 6 calls to some Indians speaking for Tech Support, 5 1/2 hours of my time wasted, and countless hours of frustration: My Xbox 360 has a .2fps on live, I must repair my connection on my computer once every 5 minutes, my sister and brother cannot connect to the internet whatsoever, and somehow Windows Vista and Windows 7 can connect perfectly without any adjustments whatsoever.

In technological advancements, shouldn&#39;t they consider past technology? (I&#39;m running XP and this router has failed to work correctly.)

The Tech Support said it could be a problem with our adapters (which I believe so), however, I find it extraordinarily ridiculous how the same company that created our wireless adapters cannot create a new router that can function without us having to buy new adapters as well.

I&#39;m officially pissed.</description>
