              <p>To fix to 2handed problem, go to the source files, then look for Item.java and Item4.java. you might only have one, it dosnt matter. then somewhere it should have a list of 2handed wepons, just add the ID in there <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
