    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-to-host-a-server/99984</link>
    <description>i need someone to host a server for me, i cannot host the server as, i dont have SP2 which you need for the latest JDK and also if i hosted the server would only be on for about 5 hours a day, the person who hosts will have to keep changing files as a send them to him/her but they person will also get admin on my server, does anyone want to host? 
 please IM or e-mail me at dan_rox_@hotmail.com or you can just post here. i also have a no-ip, so i practicaly need someone to compile the server.</description>
