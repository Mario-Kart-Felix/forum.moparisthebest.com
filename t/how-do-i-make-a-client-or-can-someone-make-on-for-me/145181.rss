    <title>How do I make a client? Or Can someone make on for me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-a-client-or-can-someone-make-on-for-me/145181</link>
    <description>wanted to know how to make my own client or if someone can make it for me I will show you people my own pic I made of it for what I want it to look like. I was thinking for about server was there a way when someone openes up client that and its linked right to my ip adress?  I has second thoughts about the thing be linked to my ip adress because when I downloaded project lol v3 client it didn&#39;t work I typed in a username and pass and it said &quot;error connecting to server&quot; If I did somethnig like that would my server do that to?

THESE PICS ARE NOT REAL I EDITED THEM AND MADE THEM MYSELF ON MS PAINT!
