    <description>hey moparscapers, i have had a blast makeing my server and ive almost got all the touchups done, one thing i found  with the comp cape is that the player only needs to complete fight kilns once inorder to equip it (ikr?) i want to change this so the player needs 99 in al skills and 120 dung, how would i go about doing this? another thing just flicked right up on this source is the max cape, you can equip it no matter what level. can someone help me fix this please? greatly appreciated :)</description>
