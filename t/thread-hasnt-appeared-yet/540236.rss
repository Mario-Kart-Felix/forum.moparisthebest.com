    <title>Thread hasn&#39;t appeared yet?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thread-hasnt-appeared-yet/540236</link>
    <description>So, I made a thread in the server dev. section yesterday, and yet it hasn&#39;t appeared yet..
Should I assume that it&#39;s supposed to be approved first due to my &gt;2000 post count, or what?


I also tried to message the mods in control of the section, but it just said that I didn&#39;t have permission for it.




edit: interestingly enough this thread posts and yet my other one doesn&#39;t..
not sure if should re-post..</description>
