    <title>RuneScape Got Ddosed? Pics Included</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-got-ddosed-pics-included/123459</link>
    <description>Hey,

     A lot of people saw it happen last night, and if you saw it, you were shocked. Every single RuneScape server was taken completely offline. I mean, Everything. You couldn&#39;t change your pass, log on regular rs, log on rsc, view highscores, go on the forum, make a new character, not even send a complaint. Well, I was smart enough to take some pics. I started wondering what could have possibly done this. Other than the main server in cambridge got shut off for some reason, or my theory, a mass, planned, ddos attack. I could be wrong, but what ever. Here&#39;s the pics:

[URL=http://www.badongo.com/pic/816514]http://www.badongo.com/pic/816514[/URL]- This is my first pic, just a pic of the worlds, all at zero.
[URL=http://www.badongo.com/pic/816515]http://www.badongo.com/pic/816515[/URL]- Front page proclaiming there&#39;s 0 people playing, that&#39;s a keeper.
[URL=http://www.badongo.com/pic/816516]http://www.badongo.com/pic/816516[/URL]- Another worlds pic, I mean every world was offline...
[URL=http://www.badongo.com/pic/816517]http://www.badongo.com/pic/816517[/URL]- German servers are no exception =p
[URL=http://www.badongo.com/pic/816518]http://www.badongo.com/pic/816518[/URL]- Sorry for this, another world pic, but it tells you that world 1 and 2 are the best.
[URL=http://www.badongo.com/pic/816519]http://www.badongo.com/pic/816519[/URL]- Don&#39;t know why I bothered posting, just rs telling me server is down.
[URL=http://www.badongo.com/pic/816520]http://www.badongo.com/pic/816520[/URL]- RSC is off =/
[URL=http://www.badongo.com/pic/816521]http://www.badongo.com/pic/816521[/URL]- Couldn&#39;t even complain...

Yeah, now you have my rsn, idk, I don&#39;t cheat. Anyways, leave feedback, what do u think happened?</description>

<li>
<p>When the outage occurred we weren’t even able to tell our users what was going on, because our news posting system is at the same facility! We are now updating our webserver software so we can at least put an explanatory message up if this sort of thing happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are updating our core loginserver software so it handles outages of this nature better. Of course if our main servers can’t talk to the internet you still won’t be able to play, but we think we can at least stop an outage of that type causing a 15 min rollback. Which should make it less annoying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously we will be chasing the ISP for an explanation of exactly what happened, and making it clear to them how unhappy we are about this, and pressuring them for assurances of what they are doing to make this less likely to happen again.</p>

<p>We have someone in the office now working overtime on Sunday afternoon, making the changes for 1+2.</p>
<p>Please accept our sincere apologies for these problems. I’m finding them as frustrating as you are!</p>
<p>Thanks for you patience<br>

Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

<p>Yes, you would have to bring every single of the 100+ worlds down.  Not to mention if MITB has a firewall for this, I’m sure RS has a better one.  And RS worlds are designed to handle much more serverload.  How often does RS get pinged with data whenever you are logged on?  Multiply that by 1000 per server on a good day.</p>
