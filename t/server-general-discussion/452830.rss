    <description>Make the section so posts have to be approved by a moderator before appearing, there&#39;s not a huge amount of discussion going on and I&#39;m sick of wading though 10+ locked topics because idiots both can&#39;t read the rules and don&#39;t care about them.

I know this would require work on the moderators&#39; parts, but it would also save the time of getting 3-4 reports a topic just so someone could come in and lock it.  It also isn&#39;t that hard to just ignore the stupid &#39;phr33 hosting&#39; topics, just leave them there and approve any actual discussion topics.  Plus it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a super vital board or anything either, they could just check it whenever they have the time to get on (so maybe 1-2 times a day) to see if there are any good posts.

Then again, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s worse to have the board and reports spammed or to have to check the board every now and then.</description>

<p>With that mod are you able to hide topics? I saw the ability to hide posts, but not topics. Unless of course if you hide the original post the rest of the thread follows also.</p>

              <p>While I don’t particularly mind approving topics in the section, I think there are better alternatives that could also suit the rest of the forum as a whole. I was actually thinking about this earlier and I think a better alternative would be to give moderators the power to ‘hide’ forum posts/threads from the community. It’s not as bad as deleting them really, but I think it should only be used in certain situations where locked topics clutter up a board (such as this situation).</p>
<p>I would of posted this idea in the staff section normally, but it ties in with your suggestion so I see no harm in it.</p>
