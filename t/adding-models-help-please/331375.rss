    <description>I went to go add some capes, and when I spawn them, they appear in the inventory as nothing.. but they are there. When I click them, I turn invisible, except 1... With the 1 cape, when I wear it, this angled lime green cape shows up. and when I click the capes, they appear in the weapons spot. i want them to appear in the cape spot, but when I turned them into .dat files, I put them as gloves.. Why is it doing that, and how do I fix it?</description>

              <p>In your source find item.java. You will see a bunch of ID’s, when you come across a list that says <code>public static int capes[]</code> Post the item ID which was included in your int’s.</p>
