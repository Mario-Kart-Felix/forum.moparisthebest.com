    <title>Post bans with reasons here!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/post-bans-with-reasons-here/447852</link>
    <description>The older topic was getting a mess, so I&#39;ve taken it down and stuck this. The topics point is still the same expect with a different format, instead of multiple pages of unrelated posts and scattered ban logging in this topic you could make 1 post per moderator and continually edit that post as you add more bans.

This makes it a lot easier to handle. Thanks. A suggested format is:

Name: Moparisthebest, reason: speedhacking, time: 3 days, date: 6/6/1666, othernotes: n/a

and so on, feel free to use bold etc if you care how it looks  ;D Once a ban has expired cross it out, and remove the banned user from the ban function on the forums.

(PS I have gone through the ban list and unbanned those who are over due, or who are felt deserve another chance, myself and Zuppers did this on the IRC).

I&#39;ll start:
