    <title>[RELEASE] User-Updated Price List</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/release-user-updated-price-list/547995</link>
    <description>[center]Haven&#39;t done anything on Mopar recently so I figured I would throw up a release. Keep in mind this is in really early stages. To see what I&#39;m going to add in the future, scroll down to the [b]Upcoming Updates[/b] section.[/center]

[u][b]Table of Contents[/b][/u]
I. What is this?
II. How do I install it?
III. Security features
IV. Download links
V. Videos and Images
VI. Future Updates
VII. Credits

[size=18pt][b]I. What is this?[/b][/size]
[spoiler]It&#39;s nothing special really, it&#39;s just a way to have your players submit their own prices for the economy, however, there are security features so people can&#39;t mess it up.[/spoiler]

[size=18pt][b]II. How do I install it?[/b][/size]
[spoiler]Download the included .zip file found in the downloads section, extra the files found in /files/ to your webhost. I would recommend making a new folder within your site title, &quot;prices&quot; so the URL would be http://www.yoursite.com/prices/. Next, you&#39;ll need to create a new database titled [b]pricer[/b] then go to import via PhpMyAdmin and import the included [i]pricer.sql[/i] file. This will set up the table needed to run the application. You&#39;ll then need to open config.php and change your setting to properly connect to the database. Then that&#39;s it, you&#39;re good to go! Keep in mind that it comes with full Bandos already added to the list. If you want to delete them, truncate the table VIA PhpMyAdmin. [/spoiler]

[size=18pt][b]III. Security Features[/b][/size]
[spoiler]

[ul][li]Users cannot add letters to the prices.[/li]
[li]Users have margins/ranges on what they can enter. If an item is 1,000,000.. The minimum is 800,000 and the maximum is 1,200,000. This functionality is demonstrated in the video.[/li][/ul]
[/spoiler]

[size=18pt][b]IV. Download Links[/b][/size]
[spoiler][b]Uppit Download[/b]
[b]Size:[/b] [i]109kb[/i]
[b]Link:[/b] [url=http://up.ht/1xZRzoS]Download[/url][/spoiler]

[size=18pt][b]V. Videos and Images[/b][/size]

[/spoiler]
[size=18pt][b]VI. Future Updates[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
[code]- Make stuff a little nicer and flashier.
- Add more security by forum integration.
- Allow users to make X amount of modifications per day.
- Include a bulk item adding function.
- Allow deletion of items other than manually going into SQL.
- Add a simple login system to the application.
- Add graphs that show an item&#39;s change over time.
- Add images to make stuff look nice.
- Report system if a user doesn&#39;t agree with prices.[/code][/spoiler]

[size=18pt][b]VII. Credits[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
Myself - HTML/CSS/PHP/JavaScript/AJAX coding and bringing it all together.
[url=http://simplemodal.plasm.it/]Plasm[/url] - For supplying me with simple modal popups because I&#39;m too lazy to create my own.[/spoiler]

[center][b][size=16pt]Before people get in their feelings and start saying this is shitty, keep in mind that it took two hours, if that, and is still in early stages of development. Stay tuned for future updates.[/size][/b][/center]</description>

if you plan on server integration id heavily suggest taking quantity/distribution into consideration<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, not sure if I’d integrate it with the server. If I do, that’s far down the road.[/quote]the way you have it is so    <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>anyone can change the price even if they dont have/can’t afford it.</p>
<p>example:</p>
<p>item X costs Y<br>
50 players on server<br>
3 people have item id X<br>
47 people can’t afford<br>
47 players can change X price from Y to (y - ( 47 * margin) )</p>
<p>server now thinks X costs much lower than its intended price (crashed item)</p>
<p>your system should be integrated with a server (seeing as your other topic asks what the rsps community needs) it should be pair-able with a server.</p>
<p>you need to take into consideration: quantity, distribution, and time.</p>

<p>Hmm, wonderful ideas here. And yes, it’s a guide. It’ll also help owners manage the economy a bit. They can see what’s jumping in price, and then work on taking down those items a bit. Thanks for the ideas man.</p>

<p>Hmm, didn’t even think of doing percent-based margins. Thanks for the suggestion, I’ll have to look into using percentages. It would have to be different percentages for different amounts though.</p>
<p>10% of 100gp = 10gp margin.<br>
10% of 1m gp = 100k gp margin.</p>
<p>Items that are 1m tend to fluctuate and drop in price a lot more than 100k.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions for a method to prevent spamming? So someone can’t change 100gp to 110gp, to 120gp, etc. Aside from forum integration. I suppose I could do IP address.</p>

<p>Uhm, I’d really say good job… But… I think you could have done better… Why should there only be a 200k margin on prices? What if a new item gets introduced to the market at 1 mill, but in 3 hours is already worth 10 mill? You can’t make that change on the system without upping it by 200k at a time (Who would want to do that?).</p>
<p>Are there like… admin controls (besides going into the database) or something?</p>
<p>I’ve also never understood why people like price guides so much… In a server, if I don’t feel justified to pay X price for something, or receive Y money for Z items, I won’t do it. I don’t care if the market says I should be paying 2x as much, or if I should be getting 1/3rd less money. The value to me is the value I’m/You’re paying. Don’t like it? Find someone else.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well the margins can be changed. And that’s why there’s going to be a report/vote system. If a price doesn’t seem right, someone can veto it and set their own price, then people have to vote whether it’s a good change. And price guides are good to get an idea of what an item is worth.</p>

<p>Uhm, I’d really say good job… But… I think you could have done better… Why should there only be a 200k margin on prices? What if a new item gets introduced to the market at 1 mill, but in 3 hours is already worth 10 mill? You can’t make that change on the system without upping it by 200k at a time (Who would want to do that?).</p>
<p>Are there like… admin controls (besides going into the database) or something?</p>
<p>I’ve also never understood why people like price guides so much… In a server, if I don’t feel justified to pay X price for something, or receive Y money for Z items, I won’t do it. I don’t care if the market says I should be paying 2x as much, or if I should be getting 1/3rd less money. The value to me is the value I’m/You’re paying. Don’t like it? Find someone else.</p>
