    <title>Lightweight Java Game Library</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lightweight-java-game-library/297417</link>
    <description>I thought some of you might be interested in this and be able to use it. 
http://www.lwjgl.org/
It stands for Lightweight Java Game Library and as you can guess its a games library, it allows you to use to access: controls like joysticks and steering wheels etc, Open GL and Open AL
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) is a solution aimed directly at professional and amateur Java programmers alike to enable commercial quality games to be written in Java. LWJGL provides developers access to high performance crossplatform libraries such as OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) and OpenAL (Open Audio Library) allowing for state of the art 3D games and 3D sound. Additionally LWJGL provides access to controllers such as Gamepads, Steering wheel and Joysticks. All in a simple and straight forward API.

LWJGL is not meant to make writing games particularly easy; it is primarily an enabling technology which allows developers to get at resources that are simply otherwise unavailable or poorly implemented on the existing Java platform. We anticipate that the LWJGL will, through evolution and extension, become the foundation for more complete game libraries and &quot;game engines&quot; as they have popularly become known, and hide some of the new evils we have had to expose in the APIs.

LWJGL is available under a BSD license, which means it&#39;s open source and freely available at no charge.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>“dont reinvent the wheel”, “why make your own if there are better ones out there”, etc.<br>
if you are programming for fun and to learn, then the above is all bullshit[/quote]</p>

              <p>Abraham obviously doesn’t understand that OpenGL support is built into all modern video cards and they strive to implement as much as possible of it on the actual hardware, because it is faster that way.  This means that no matter what you do, how you do it, or what fancy-ass algorithm you come up with creating your top-of-the-line software renderer, it is always going to be a few orders of magnitude slower than OpenGL.  I suppose you could create your own video card to support your renderer, then try to get it accepted mainstream and get game developers to use it, but they won’t.</p>
<p>Bottom line, use OpenGL.</p>

<p>Using an already existing library is the ideal way to go. Even though a library like OpenGL is somewhat old, that does not mean it is not good. Think about it, php, and C are also old, but that does not stop programmers from programming the language.</p>

/agree<br>
jME is the ugliest shit<br>
jPCT is alright<br>
xith3D havnt looked, name gives me the creeps tho…so probably ugly too</p>
<p>whenever anyone asks me which would be the best engine, i simply say your own, you will learn something and its programmed how you like it</p>
<p>anyway i do prefer jogl over lwjgl, even tho lwjgl has been around longer it has issues on different platforms. note that those 2 are just your interfaces to OpenGL</p>
