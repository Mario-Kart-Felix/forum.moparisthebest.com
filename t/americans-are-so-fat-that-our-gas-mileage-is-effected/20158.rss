    <description>Americans are so fat that our Gas Mileage is effected

Article: http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061025/ap_on_re_us/obesity_gas_consumption
&lt;blockquote&gt;CHICAGO - Want to spend less at the pump? Lose some weight. That&#39;s the implication of a new study that says Americans are burning nearly 1 billion more gallons of gasoline each year than they did in 1960 because of their expanding waistlines. Simply put, more weight in the car means lower gas mileage.

Using recent gas prices of $2.20 a gallon, that translates to about $2.2 billion more spent on gas each year.

&quot;The bottom line is that our hunger for food and our hunger for oil are not independent. There is a relationship between the two,&quot; said University of Illinois researcher Sheldon Jacobson, a study co-author.

&quot;If a person reduces the weight in their car, either by removing excess baggage, carrying around less weight in their trunk, or yes, even losing weight, they will indeed see a drop in their fuel consumption.&quot;

The lost mileage is pretty small for any single driver. Jacobson said the typical driver — someone who records less than 12,000 miles annually — would use roughly 18 fewer gallons of gas over the course of a year by losing 100 pounds. At $2.20 per gallon, that would be a savings of almost $40.

Outside experts said that even if the calculations aren&#39;t exact, the study makes sense.

&quot;If you put more weight into your car, you&#39;re going to get fewer miles per gallon,&quot; Emory University health care analyst Kenneth Thorpe said Wednesday.

The same effect has been seen in airplanes. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that heavy fliers have contributed to higher fuel costs for airlines.

The obesity rate among U.S. adults doubled from 1987 to 2003, from about 15 percent to more than 30 percent. Also, the average weight for American men was 191 pounds in 2002 and 164 pounds for women, about 25 pounds heavier than in 1960, government figures show.

The study&#39;s conclusions are based on those weight figures and Americans&#39; 2003 driving habits, involving roughly 223 million cars and light trucks nationwide.

It will appear in the October-December issue of The Engineering Economist, a peer-reviewed journal published by the American Society of Engineering Education and the Institute of Industrial Engineers.

Jacobson, an industrial engineer, conducted the research with Laura McLay, a doctoral student in his Champaign-Urbana lab who now works at Virginia Commonwealth University.

They estimated that more than 39 million gallons of fuel are used each year for every additional pound of passenger weight.

The amount of extra fuel consumption blamed on weight gain since 1960 — 938 million gallons — would fill almost 2 million cars with gas for an entire year. However, that is only 0.7 percent of the total amount of fuel consumed by U.S. passenger vehicles each year, Jacobson said.

The estimates &quot;are probably pretty reliable,&quot; said Larry Chavis, an economist at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. &quot;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to encourage anybody to go out and lose weight to save gasoline, but even for individual families, it could have an effect on their budget.&quot;

Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, former
CDC director and chairman of an Institute of Medicine report on obesity, said the findings are almost beside the point.

&quot;The wrong fuel is being focused on,&quot; said Koplan, now at Emory University. &quot;If you&#39;re heavier, the most important fuel you use more of is food.&quot;

Eating less, driving less and choosing more active means of transportation would reduce gas consumption, and also help reverse rising obesity rates, he said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

lol this sucks for them. And this also reminds me that I haven&#39;t ran today :eek: ! 

My gas mileage is about... 28 miles to the galon. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not a fat porker. :P

<p>lol ok I’ll run over. Any way, I forgot that it depends on what sport you play and what you eat, etc. I admit, I was wrong.</p>
<p>I forgot that for teenage football players, the ideal fat percentage is around 7%. Notice, every time I said the fat percentage, I’m also saying teenage. For the teenagers, it’s 7% ideal (according to a friend of mine) for football players.  So I was still right in a sense, because I was talking about the ideal percentage for my sport. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>According to this chart, it’s like… 9 - 12% for backs, and 15-19% for linebacks.<br>

<p>LOL!</p>
<p>I’m 5’10" and ~145lb. I know for a fact I’m not fat. If I was, I’d have a hell of a time in TKD, which I don’t. A lot of people tell me I’m a little on the skinny side, but I don’t think that either. To be honest, I think I’m exactly normal.</p>

<p>And if anyone didn’t know, Golf is not a sport. It’s a bunch of rich people with nothing better to do. Jk I play golf, but it’s not hard work and full of drills like basketball, football, track, any other ‘real’ sport. Don’t waste yoru time on the computer. That’s what I did for a while.

Though for some reason I’m in shape <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>Just run around a little. Get active in one of your school sports. Track is very good! It’s my favorite. I suck at football, and I’m not tall enough for basketball, so I just find a sport I like. Even tennis is fun.</p>
<p>And if anyone didn’t know, Golf is not a sport. It’s a bunch of rich people with nothing better to do. Jk I play golf, but it’s not hard work and full of drills like basketball, football, track, any other ‘real’ sport. Don’t waste yoru time on the computer. That’s what I did for a while. I made my comp time an hour per day and I spend that time on the forums while reading news. lol.[br][size=1]Posted at: October 26, 2006, 09:29:34 PM[/size][hr][quote author=XxKanexX link=topic=30578.msg354226#msg354226 date=1161930761]<br>
My friend went over there and said that the meals are huge.</p>
<p>So i’m glad i don’t live there. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

lol yeah a lot of the meals here are big.</p>
<p>Hey back to weight discussion, my coach weighs 230 pounds and that guy is so jacked all over. He went to the doctors one day, and they used the BMI (body mass index) on him, and it showed that he was obese.</p>
<p>Muscle weighs more than Fat, so it was pretty funny. His health insurance company denied his application for insurance because they say he’s obese. Talk about major fatness in america. He’s probably the .02% of the population that has that problem.[/quote]</p>
<p>dude your not anorexic or w/e if u have 5% body fat…i know people that are 170+ pounds with 5% body fat on the Varsity Football team…They are fucking monsters…they are just mostly muscle if you think i don’t know what I’m talking about why don’t you run over to Florida and i will show you.</p>

<p>If you go 60 MPH for 100 miles,NON STOP, you’d use around 5-6 gallons.<br>
If you go 40 MPH for 100 miles,NON STOP, you’d use around 9 gallons.<br>
If you were in-city, goin 40 MPH for 50 miles, you’d use around 2 gallons.<br>
If you were in city going 60 MPH for 50 miles, you’d use 5 gallons of gas.</p>
<p>In turn - Slow in city, Fast on highway. We knew that, Didn’t we.</p>

              <p>Killer kure, if you knew what you were talking about, you would know that for all teenage athletes, 15% is ideal. And only people that are crazy and on varsity are the ones that have that. Below 10% is close to anorexic, and below 5% is anorexic. Know your facts. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I don’t play any sports.  I just sit in front of the computer all day.  But if you saw me you’d probably say I was the skinniest person you’ve ever seen :P.  Though for some reason I’m in shape <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=9" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:">[/quote]<br>
Just run around a little. Get active in one of your school sports. Track is very good! It’s my favorite. I suck at football, and I’m not tall enough for basketball, so I just find a sport I like. Even tennis is fun.</p>
<p>And if anyone didn’t know, Golf is not a sport. It’s a bunch of rich people with nothing better to do. Jk I play golf, but it’s not hard work and full of drills like basketball, football, track, any other ‘real’ sport. Don’t waste yoru time on the computer. That’s what I did for a while. I made my comp time an hour per day and I spend that time on the forums while reading news. lol.[br][size=1]Posted at: October 26, 2006, 09:29:34 PM[/size][hr][quote=“XxKanexX, post:11, topic:20158”]My friend went over there and said that the meals are huge.</p>
<p>So i’m glad i don’t live there. ;)[/quote]<br>
lol yeah a lot of the meals here are big.</p>
<p>Hey back to weight discussion, my coach weighs 230 pounds and that guy is so jacked all over. He went to the doctors one day, and they used the BMI (body mass index) on him, and it showed that he was obese.</p>
<p>Muscle weighs more than Fat, so it was pretty funny. His health insurance company denied his application for insurance because they say he’s obese. Talk about major fatness in america. He’s probably the .02% of the population that has that problem.</p>
