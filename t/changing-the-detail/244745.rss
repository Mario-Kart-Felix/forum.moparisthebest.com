    <title>Changing the detail</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-detail/244745</link>
    <description>I know it should probably be an easy question to answer, so I gave it a search and the most recent post I found with the word &quot;detail&quot; in it is dated back to 2006, and I was unable to find it in the FAQs that I could find.

Basically it says change the batch file, but the file is diffrent from 2006, it says to 

&quot;::param 0 for highmem, 1 for lowmem, another 0 to make the song not startup&quot;

Exactly where do I enter these commands, I tried entering ::param 0 and even ::param 1 and they did nothing in game, I tried adding them to the batch file and it did nothing.

I know there are higher detail settings because I&#39;ve seen them in screenshots.

EDIT: I found out that the search dates are a bit messed up, still the topics that I found had extremely vague answers or none at all.</description>
