    <description>just a question that i thault about how much bandwidth dose google use per day i heard that they get around 

91,000,000 &quot;Hello World&quot; searches per day  :eek: true/false ?

a few facts 

# Google&#39;s name is a play on the word googol, which refers to the number 1 followed by one hundred zeroes. The term was coined by Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner, and was popularized in the book, &quot;Mathematics and the Imagination&quot; by Kasner and James Newman. Google&#39;s play on the term reflects the company&#39;s mission to organize the immense amount of information available on the web.

# Google started as a research project at Stanford University, created by Ph.D. candidates Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were 24 years old and 23 years old respectively (a combined 47 years old).

# Google&#39;s index of web pages is the largest in the world, comprising of billions of web pages. Google searches this immense collection of web pages often in less than half a second.

# Google receives daily search requests from all over the world, including Antarctica.

# Users can restrict their searches for content in 35 non-English languages, including Chinese, Greek, Icelandic, Hebrew, Hungarian and Estonian. To date, no requests have been received from beyond the earth&#39;s orbit, but Google has a Klingon interface just in case.

# Google has a world-class staff of more than 2,668 employees known as Googlers. The company headquarters is called the Googleplex.

# Google translates billions of HTML web pages into a display format for WAP and i-mode phones and wireless handheld devices, and has made it possible to enter a search using only one phone pad keystroke per letter, instead of multiple keystrokes.

# Google Groups comprises more than 845 million Usenet messages, which is the world&#39;s largest collection of messages or the equivalent of more than a terabyte of human conversation.

# The basis of Google&#39;s search technology is called PageRank™, and assigns an &quot;importance&quot; value to each page on the web and gives it a rank to determine how useful it is. However, that&#39;s not why it&#39;s called PageRank. It&#39;s actually named after Google co-founder Larry Page.

# Googlers are multifaceted. One operations manager, who keeps the Google network in good health is a former neurosurgeon. One software engineer is a former rocket scientist. And the company&#39;s chef formerly prepared meals for members of The Grateful Dead and funkmeister George Clinton.
