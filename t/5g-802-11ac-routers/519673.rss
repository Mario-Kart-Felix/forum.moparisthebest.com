    <title>&quot;5G&quot; - 802.11ac routers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/5g-802-11ac-routers/519673</link>
    <description>I currently have a 50mbps wireless n connection with comcast. When it got updated from 25mbps to 50mbps just the other day I found out my old cisco was a (b/g?).  Thus, for full effect I need to get a wireless N :)

[hr]

Okay so..I am ASSUMING that they are backward compatible normally and hence ac would play n. I know a couple of routers I looked at did state this.

Here is my question what would you do? Would you just buy the wireless n router for now and possibly invest into an ac one later? Or purchase an ac one now. 

These are the two routers I am considering:

AC one:

http://www.bestbuy.com/site/NETGEAR+-+Wireless-AC+Gigabit+Router+with+4-Port+Ethernet+Switch/5400765.p?id=1218642235468&amp;skuId=5400765

^ this one is tempting cause I can finance for six months...

OR

N one:

http://www.bestbuy.com/site/NETGEAR+-+N750+Dual-Band+Wireless-N+Gigabit+Router+with+4-Port+Ethernet+Switch/6263799.p?id=1218725177432&amp;skuId=6263799

^ I have heard several people state this is THE router to have for gaming?</description>

<p>I had the funds already prepared(credit wise :o) so I went on ahead and just ordered the ac. I can always take it back f it doesn’t perform as it should. …got 90$ rewards back anyway xD…</p>
<p>ac router supposed to arrive today and the adapter tomorrow according to the ups tracker. I am intrigued by this “beamforming” I have heard “bullcrap” stories and stories of wonders about it. So not sure yet will be a new experience.</p>

              <p>Alright appreciate the consultation Justin. One last question I have been trying to google this and I can’t seem to find this. I don’t know a whole lot about the different switch layers but my dad suggested I make sure it does Layer 1 and 2. I haven’t been able to find a spec sheet that says either way. Do you know know/is there any way to find out?</p>
<p>Also mostly out of curiosity why was WEP removed from AC routers? And which network encryption do you suggest instead. I think it said it had wap2/wap-psk but I never used either one of those.</p>

If you feel like you need something right now, go with the second one, and over time keep an eye on some of Cisco’s commercial grade 802.11ac routers. You wouldn’t get 1gbps unless you had fiber, and that is still a ways away. If you ever decide you want to make use of a gigabit LAN for streaming across the house, that router will still support it just fine.</p>
<p>The spec is very very new, and will still take a few years before it comes widespread, so I wouldn’t worry about diving straight into this. If you’re just now building a gaming rig, go with any 802.11n dual band card, and in a few years when its time to upgrade, you can focus on upgrading your network too. The only reason I suggest commercial grade is because they will last much longer. It is definitely not needed, but nice to have</p>

              <p>Holy shit dem speeds. You don’t run a gigabit network at home, so the first one is even more of a waste. Wireless-N still supports speeds up to 750mbps, and unless your card supports that 5Ghz frequency its still going to fall back on 2.4b/g/n. In all honesty, if you were going to invest, I’d invest in something commercial grade.</p>
<p>If you are using it for gaming, is it PC or Console? The 360 and PS3 only support the 2.4Ghz b/g/n frequency, so you won’t benefit from the higher end half of it anyways. If its wired, they both support gigabit networks so go for the cheaper.</p>
<p>802.11g theoretically supports 54mbps so you don’t need to upgrade just yet, although who doesn’t want a shiny new toy?</p>
