    <title>Lets have an intelligent discussion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lets-have-an-intelligent-discussion/147239</link>
    <description>I have decided to head this off in the hope that semaphore might realise we are not all [s]purposely[/s] intentionally as stupid as we appear :)

For anyone who is an idiot: fuck off


[quote=&quot;semaphore, post:11, topic:145473&quot;]world traveling (given a world location the bot will move to that location no matter where it is)[/quote]
The only things that you might pause to think about would be how much of the world you want to have accessible (I would be inclined to go with major landmarks) and how you want your data to be represented. Maybe it is just me continuing in my stage of graph-fetish, but I would have landmarks as nodes and the routes as edges; the landmark might be an area of it might be an exact coordinate, the route being a list of actions (walking, using etc).

[quote=&quot;semaphore, post:11, topic:145473&quot;]script pausing for random event handling(effective practices for pausing a bot reliably for random event handling)[/quote]This problem I see as being non-existent with an event scripted bot, given that events are consumed and handlers have the proper priority (and of course that the script writer isn&#39;t an idiot). Thread scripted bots are [i]so[/i] RSC :P But I would only be a hobbyist cheater, events might be inefficient for high-density cheating.

[quote=&quot;semaphore, post:11, topic:145473&quot;]resource management (getting your bots to run at ~3% cpu without risking blatant detection).[/quote]I personally would prefer to see discussion on memory reduction. However, as for lowering cpu usage, deobfuscating the arithmetic fuckery, disabling the filling of polygons and *altering* any nonessential calculations will bring it down a large amount, how much I cannot say until I do it myself.

cut me down, elaborate, give your ideas.... go for it</description>

<p>? Isn’t that what the game does?</p>
<p>They use a multidimensional array to perform bitwise checks to validate if parts of the tile is traversal open or traversal closed (as well as projectile open / projectile closed). As bash pointed out, doors would have to be treated differently as the game itself treats doors as any other traversal/projectile blocker.</p>
<p>I use a ray scanning approach that, in my opinion, looks quite human. I use data that is shared among all instances that contains global location information. I found this to be very memory friendly. Doors and other path traversable entities are marked and at runtime their state is updated. The system only loads the data as the bot needs it and the data is unloaded as soon as a path is generated and the runtime logic will handle any portals, doors, gates, etc as they come. The tedious portion is mapping out connectors. From what I could see, there were no hard-coded locations that indicate where a path object will teleport/connect to.</p>
<p>As far as I’m concerned, there is no <span class="bbcode-i">right</span> answer to this. One implementation, in my opinion, is just as good as any other; so long as it handles movement completely. I see it much like updating code; reliability &gt; speed. The only stipulation I put on this is that it works every time from any location to any location. It took me quite a while to be able to successfully traverse from literally any location in the game to literally any other location in the game; handling doors, ladders, portals, etc as they arise. wL will say otherwise ( <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ), but <em>I</em> happened to think the feat was nontrivial. Getting from one location to another from anywhere on the same level or story is relatively simple. (Note I said <span class="bbcode-i">relatively</span>). Getting from one level to another level elsewhere and even validating if the location even exists is tricky if the location does not happen to be loaded in the game client.</p>
<p>After successful path finding comes the actual act of traversing it successfully without looking completely like a bot. Any idiot can create a node-to-node map-clicking movement function. It’s a bit trickier to reliably move from point to point along a path without giving away the fact that you are a bot. I know that if <em>I</em> can tell a bot from a human just by watching them move from place to place, anyone can. Getting your bot to move fluidly like a human would is not as cut-and-dry as one would think. One issue people find they have to get over is the movement of the map while the bot is moving. Training the mouse over the exact location is cumbersome, can be cpu intensive, and will increase the odds of detection (abnormal mouse jittering over an exact location).</p>
<p>Good discussion though, much more interesting to talk about this stuff over how fast one’s updater was able to find <span class="bbcode-i">getMaxHps</span>.</p>

<p>My opinion on this is just dont bother, it wont kill you to walk around making a large tile array, especially when you can make a script to do it for you and output the next tile wherever you plant the flag, also a JFrame with undo/redo buttons.</p>
<p>But now that im thinking about it, the client has the maths which makes a nice path that correctly walks around trees and walls without getting stuck, it probably only works for the current amount of tiles loaded. So you make a straight-line path to find the tile on the edge of the loading screen, and copy the client’s maths to get you there.</p>
<p>I’m getting really into this, I even drew you a picture <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>well the return-style scripting is annoying…<br>
well maybe you dont even have to pause a script, just stop it having any effect, like the methods for mouse-moving and key-pressing dont do anything if a boolean is true.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(randomBeingHandled)
   return;
moveMouse(hereX, thereY);</code></pre>
<p>but it would be annoying cause your script doesnt have any guarantees its moved the mouse, you could make it throw a runtime exception which just makes the script forget everything and start again from the last place it was… well, I’m out of ideas for that one.</p>
<p>well I guess this is the best I can do for this sort of thing</p>

Walls and doors would have to be special cases. If they are represented as items it is possible to have 3 different items on a tile, horizontal and vertical walls and a part of a tree. Alternatively it is possible to have 4 different arrays, vertical and horizontal walls, immutable items(trees) and items(objects like bread on the ground).</p>
<p>It is more complex than a simple 2D array and I recommend that you use something a bit more space saving than a 3D array. I have not looked at the client in a long time so I don’t know how this works.</p>

              <p>I am obviously not the one to consult on bot brainstorming, but I wanted to ask a question. If you were to send a packet to move from (say) 1500, 1500 to 3500, 3500; would your char actually move, or do you have to walk in steps (1500, 1500 to 1520, 1520, etc)?</p>
<p>Even if the former were possible, I would presume the RS servers would freak out and slam a couple black marks on you.</p>

              <p>I’m sure it would be possible to have a bot where EVERY tile is node and there are edges between the closest 8 (diagonally as well). These edges would only exist if a wall was not in the way and the nodes would only exist if they were not in an object. You can then have “action” edges for opening doors and the need to run as it is likely that you are under attack.</p>
<p>You can then extend this concept by having actions for ladders allowing you to map dungeons and so on.</p>
<p>On top of this you can randomise the path, making it a few squares longer and avoid detect ability. Or pass a integer argument specifying how random it needs to be allowing time critical applications such as pking to move faster or slower ones such as essmining.</p>
<p>Ruler already has an algorithm to do this which he has optimised the hell out of so I wouldn’t say it would be too CPU intensive. The advantages is that you can walk anywhere, you don’t need to give multiple paths and things like pking becomes much faster because instead of your character finding a route through masses of trees you can do it, avoiding the walking back that is so annoying.</p>

yes, i think this also, i would need to investigate more into the client to find out a better way of doing this.</p>
<p>as for world walking, i am not too sure, maybe use the minimap to walk around objects? idk, the only way i can think, is having a big array of walkable areas and a path maker.</p>
