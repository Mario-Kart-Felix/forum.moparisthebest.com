    <title>Shop Buying Problem 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-buying-problem-508/395692</link>
    <description>I am using the 508 Mezzy Scape V3.5 source download and trying to make it so that all skills are train-able. But first I wanted to clean up the bugs and some other non-wanted crap.

One of my two biggest issues is the Shop buying/selling. 

What happens is there is only three options. I would like to completely revamp the buying from shops.

Is there anyone that can point me in the right direction or point out some tutorials on this??

Help is very much appreciated.

Please, if you come here to call me a leach then just hit the back button. We are all leachers at some point and after I am done I intend on giving credits and what was originally MezzyScape will look like it was just a good base source.

Thank you in advance!!</description>
