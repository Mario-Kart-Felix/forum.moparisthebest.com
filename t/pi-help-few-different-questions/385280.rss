    <title>[PI] Help. Few different questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-help-few-different-questions/385280</link>
    <description>Okay, well I am about 4 hours into coding. In total I mean, I just started programming tonight:P

1) My lesser demons are dee dee dee looking:\ they look like they got hit by a freight train..

2) Commands aren&#39;t working.. e.g. ::item even though they are in the command.java

3) The walking looks  absolutely ridiculous. Is there any way to make it better?

4) I just made it so there is a thing under the quest tab that teles you to varrock e.g. (actionButtonId) being changed. but there is one error. &quot;^&quot; under the a in action (on the compiler) and it says it cannot find the symbol?

I have more questions. But that seems like a pretty big task for me already, considering I know nothing about programming ^.^</description>

              <p>hmmmm , i think your walking method’s using the wrong animation for walking XD<br>
lemme post my method , that should work for you…</p>
<p>go to CombatAssistant.java<br>
search for the getPlayerAnim method.<br>
you should see somthing like this :</p>
<p><code>public void getPlayerAnimIndex(String weaponName){
		c.playerStandIndex = 0x328;
		c.playerTurnIndex = 0x337;
		c.playerWalkIndex = 0x333;
		c.playerTurn180Index = 0x334;
		c.playerTurn90CWIndex = 0x335;
		c.playerTurn90CCWIndex = 0x336;
		c.playerRunIndex = 0x338;]</code><br>
post yours , it might be so that the normal walkIndex isn’t defined there.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>1 Can you list suggestions to fix them then? is it just the models? orrrr…</p>
<p>2 I could not find any, as this is the original PI so i searched for sanity and changed them all</p>
<p>3 I am a BRAND new coder, I am gonna need a little more specification to this pleasee!</p>
<p>4 Oh okay I’ll try right now and see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>1) i suppose you are using the original PI?
i dont know how to fix that , we generally use the 474 demon models with PI ( try Exion's PI source )
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>did you give yourself a higher rank in yor players save file?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pics plz , cant help without seeing the problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you erase the text “actionbuttonID” and just write case 0000:<br>
0000 being the actionbuttonID ( the number )</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<li>
<p>I am not sure how to go about this yet… I am guessing I need to find the correct 474 model and take out the old model and add the new? Yes I am using Sanity’s original PI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes I am playerRights 3, that’s owner correct? Or just admin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok I can really show you with pics. It would have to be a video or something. And I dunno anything about videos. It just has really laggy uncoordinated walking. you move and the character doesnt not take steps correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh I guess that would make sense ^.^ I tried to use an IDE but apparently I still need experience to understand those too…</p>
</li>

3. You can change how a player walks, depending on the weapon wielded.</blockquote>
<p>No sir, I mean without wielding anything. The walking is bugged or something I’m not sure yet.</p>
