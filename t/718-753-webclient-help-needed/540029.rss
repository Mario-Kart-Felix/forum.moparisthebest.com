    <description>Hey,

so this is what happened, i jarred my client, it all worked, for my friends too. so i thought, why not try to make a webclient? so i was looking for some html-codes.
now this is my problem: i tried multiple html-codes, but everytime i open my site it just stays at black/white screen, everything should work just fine i guess, i uploaded my client and if i open that site it downloads immediatly, also the redirections seem perfectly fine to me, so idk whats wrong.. 

please help?</description>
