<p>The point I was trying to make (I think, I got lost halfway) is that the system as it is creates a situation where shit happening to people early in life (which may, like me, be out of my control, or I guess might just be some kid who was a delinquent when young but then grew up or whatever) makes it difficult to turn it around, regardless of drive or intelligence or whatever.</p>

<p>I wish i listened to older people when they told me to do good in school. I figured it out a little late but i still have enough time to fix it. Its true though, as you grow the less important your life becomes. You’re first 20 years will make it or break it.</p>
<p>You’ve made me more mad at our own system more than ever. All the holes really fuck it up for the ones who need it.</p>

        <p>I agree with Mopman; it’s very hard for homeless people to get out. They struggle to stay clean, which means interviewers for potential jobs write them off. They struggle to remain healthy, mentally and physically.</p>
<p>I think anyone who suggests that someone would choose to be poor is a moron. And for the record, most homeless people were homeless before they started taking drugs; they end up doing things such as chroming (paint sniffing) as a coping mechanism.</p>
<p>And for the record, everyone has thus far overlooked the simple fact that the rich aren’t expected to get off their arse – they can skip out on any real work just by virtue of lucking out.<br>
The best and brightest may never end up dying rich, despite doing their very best. On the flip side of the coin, some talentless hack, like the author of Twilight, writes a slop of shit romance novel which just so happened to appeal to most girls. Instant millionaire, and she’ll never have to work again should she choose not to.</p>

<p>A large percentage of them took the drugs or alcohol up because of the homelessness, and not vice versa.

        <p>How do you get a job at said fast food restaurant, with no fixed address?</p>
<p>That is, assuming there is a shelter like that near you, too.</p>
<p>In the UK, homeless people can still claim Jobseekers Allowance without a fixed address by Giro. So that’s £50 give or take a week to spend on bread or whatever (hopefully not booze, though I don’t doubt that it happens). That’s perhaps enough to live a somewhat meager life on, but it isn’t helping you get out of your situation anytime soon.</p>

        <p>Ah, OK. Well, that would be very useful. I’m not sure we even have anywhere like that near me, though. There’s a few places that will give you some food, if you’re lucky, and a place in the town centre that has residency, but they’re practically always full and give priority to people who are likely to be short term. Which is fair enough, since they’re always full. At least they get to help out some single mum who got kicked out of her home or whatever who will probably have somewhere to stay in a few weeks.</p>

        <p>Actually, that issue with residency is one of the biggest obstacles (if not the biggest) in Australia too. Our shelters are always operating at full capacity too, and the result is that some people are turned away.<br>
Finally, some shelters only cater to women. This is good, because many women on the streets are there because they’re fleeing domestic violence. But with that being the case, that’s automatically a large list of shelters that any man can not make use of.</p>
<p>I can’t fathom the need for a residential address when it comes to receiving welfare payments; it’s like a kick in the teeth to those who need it most.</p>

Yes, if they nothing the poor will stay poor, and if the rich keep doing what they’re doing they will stay rich.  Where theres a will theres a way, but some people are in fact too lazy to cross the bridge.[/quote]Ya, it is the grinding-wheel of pure capitalism. There must be a huge poor working-class in order to accomodate for the rich, so essentially it is a very inhumane system. I believe that socialistic democracy is the best solution to this problem that we have today (Judging from the high living standards in scandinavia and other socialistic democracies).</p>
<p>The USA often brags about their Capitalistic system and success, and one of the many arguments i hear from the extremely conservative branch is “You are communists, we have thousands of products, what do you have?”. Well, first of all the USA isn’t even pure Capitalism (since there’s a few elite companies with way more power than they should have). Secondly, how much choice do you really have? Yeah, you got Dr Pepper, Coca Cola and Pepsi! The only problem here is that they are essentially the same thing, they are produced by the same big ol’ company, so you don’t really have that big and mighty choice you so prompty claim to have!</p>
<p>In a socialistic-democratic environment, Companies are allowed to exist, and are encouraged to thrive, but the essential things such as Healthcare and Education are either owned or funded by the state. (we have both private and public education that is equally good here, and both are free up until uni-level, where you start paying for things such as books and other neccessary materials for your education). Having drugs (Tobacco, Alcohol) government-regulated i feel is a good thing too, to ensure the taxes of these items are incredibly high and to stop oversupply and potential addictions leading to a bad life.</p>
<p>If you are going to work for the system, pay taxes all your life and fund the government, then it’s just fair that they give you the means to do so.</p>
<p>This prevents exploitation (assuming the state isn’t shit), and gives you a social security “web”, that protects you, should something go wrong.</p>
<p>I just woke up, so i have probably missed out on some things i wanted to say here, i think i got most of it down though.</p>

<p>Not everyone can be rich, and the rich people usually end up creating many middle class jobs for those who want to live well. The rich work with their mind, and in most cases they have it in a way that benefits the employees and the owner. But its not just the owner and then people working the machines, there is a whole hierarchy of people needed to be paid respected to their education, and shitton of more workers to pay. Why does McDonalds pay fast food workers minimum wage? I honestly don’t know, but would you give them any bigger of a cut without at least raising the experience requirements? I can see how your views would, in a way, protect everyone. But thats not how America was created to be.</p>
<p>America compared to many other countries is like a bike without training wheels. Its so easy to fall and so easy to stay up right.</p>

And this is the reason why all these Fox newscasters are always bashing Obama’s socialist policies. Right now our federal government provides too many things that it shouldnt, like social security, medicare, welfare, etc. These should all be funded by the state, our federal government forcing these things on all states is in a way, unconstitutional.</p>
<p>But, theres no limit to how much you can succeed in America either. Capitalism is the reason why microsoft is here, apple is here, coca cola is here, the phone exists, the lightbulb exists etc. All these people knew that if they succeeded there was nothing holding them down from being insanely rich. That probably wasn’t their only motive, but it definitely motivated them. Something similar to this is the reason so many people complain about sports players making $7m a year from throwing a ball around and endorsements. I had a problem with it, until i realized American citizens paid them, they’re paid by the people coming to games etc.</p>

<p>But none of those things go away if you provide welfare, medical assistance etc. They’re not mutually exclusive. The light bulb is, after all, a British invention. <img src="../../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
