<p>Well war is a very horrible thing that should be avoided at all costs. But haven’t you noticed that many of the self progressive nations have stayed relatively war free since world war 2? The free world most of all (excluding our policing in the Middle East, Vietnam, Korea etc.). The faster we get the middle east sorted out the faster they can be self progressive and we will be one step closer to world peace. Freedom in this world comes from blood and money, of course this isnt the only solution but it will usually end up this way. People don’t realize how many people died in wars for them to even show public opposition to war.</p>
<p>Its no doubt that when the modern world finds an alternative to oil the middle east will die, now is our chance.</p>

I’m not even going to answer that.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I seriously wonder what you’ve based your reasoning on. What makes you believe that the majority of the people in any particular military are ‘good people’?[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not one of those you see on the news labeling every solider out there fighting a hero, or anything like that, it isn’t me labeling them as a good person because they’re in the military, I’m labeling them that because I happen to think the majority of the population in this country, and in other countries like the US are good people.</p>
<p>Then of course, there is the other point of me knowing many, many people in the British armed forces, including a family member. But that is small, I am just one of those people who genuinely believe there are more good people in this world than not.</p>
<p>Other than that, I agree with Frell on this one.</p>

What you’re referring to is the incidence of psychopathy.</p>
<p>I read an article a while ago about how the Jews were bragging about a low incidence of PTSD in their soldiers that returned from service.<br>
The author of that article pointed out that a low incidence of PTSD could mean a high incidence of psychopathy.<br>
In short, the worst ones are the Jews.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Frell, post:25, topic:366127”]Well war is a very horrible thing that should be avoided at all costs. But haven’t you noticed that many of the self progressive nations have stayed relatively war free since world war 2? The free world most of all (excluding our policing in the Middle East, Vietnam, Korea etc.). The faster we get the middle east sorted out the faster they can be self progressive and we will be one step closer to world peace. Freedom in this world comes from blood and money, of course this isnt the only solution but it will usually end up this way. People don’t realize how many people died in wars for them to even show public opposition to war.</p>
<p>Its no doubt that when the modern world finds an alternative to oil the middle east will die, now is our chance.[/quote]</p>
<p>World peace can be achieved in two ways: by force, and end up with one worldwide police state, or by acceptance. I don’t know about you, but I prefer acceptance. Accept the differences between ‘us and them’. I know your rebuttal will be “they attacked us first”, but is that really the case? Sure, when you’re talking about direct attacks the Muslim extremists probably were the aggressors. But there’s a reason they attack. Just look at the Western corporations digging up natural resources in Africa and the Middle-East, and giving the locals barely anything in return. Look at Niger Delta. Look at the big forests. Look at the Somalian coast.</p>
<p>The Western world is always growing richer, and for that we need resources. Africa and the Middle-East are have a lot of these resources. You’d think that because of that, they would be very rich. But they aren’t. All the locals get is crap. We even send the ships we don’t need anymore for them to recycle, so we don’t have to deal with the heavy pollutants. This is what enrages people. Add to that the aftereffects of the Cold War, stir it, top it off with Israel, and you get anything but world peace.</p>

Its the governments fault if locals are not getting any benefits from the sale of the resources. Iraq has an income of $59b(IIRC) a year just from oil, but when people like Saddam dont use it to restore infrastructure its useless.</p>

Well war is a very horrible thing that should be avoided at all costs. But haven’t you noticed that many of the self progressive nations have stayed relatively war free since world war 2? The free world most of all (excluding our policing in the Middle East, Vietnam, Korea etc.). The faster we get the middle east sorted out the faster they can be self progressive and we will be one step closer to world peace. Freedom in this world comes from blood and money, of course this isnt the only solution but it will usually end up this way. People don’t realize how many people died in wars for them to even show public opposition to war.</p>
<p>Its no doubt that when the modern world finds an alternative to oil the middle east will die, now is our chance.<br>

<p>World peace can be achieved in two ways: by force, and end up with one worldwide police state, or by acceptance. I don’t know about you, but I prefer acceptance. Accept the differences between ‘us and them’. I know your rebuttal will be “they attacked us first”, but is that really the case? Sure, when you’re talking about direct attacks the Muslim extremists probably were the aggressors. But there’s a reason they attack. Just look at the Western corporations digging up natural resources in Africa and the Middle-East, and giving the locals barely anything in return. Look at Niger Delta. Look at the big forests. Look at the Somalian coast.</p>
<p>The Western world is always growing richer, and for that we need resources. Africa and the Middle-East are have a lot of these resources. You’d think that because of that, they would be very rich. But they aren’t. All the locals get is crap. We even send the ships we don’t need anymore for them to recycle, so we don’t have to deal with the heavy pollutants. This is what enrages people. Add to that the aftereffects of the Cold War, stir it, top it off with Israel, and you get anything but world peace.[/quote]</p>
<p>Spot on.</p>

<p>That is is probably exactly what was going on when the british empire existed, but it doesn’t exist anymore.  Now all the people getting rich are local people who don’t give a shit about their neighbors, like the ‘royalty’ in Africa and the Middle East.  Like Saddam Hussein making billions from oil, yet his entire country falling apart, thousands starving, and he uses some of the money for bullets to kill his own people.  So the blame needs placed where it belongs, to the bastards locally and not to be blamed on the ‘big countries to the west’.</p>

        <p>I could never directly criticise friendly fire. It’s a deep deep shame and that’s all that can be said, but until soldiers have the technology in the battlefield to know exactly whose friendly or hostile then it’s just something that can and will happen.</p>
<p>Most people here will have played a FPS with friendly fire enabled, I challenge someone to tell me while relaxing in your bedroom you haven’t accidentally shot a team mate. Take that totally meaningless, in-game situation - add some real world scenery, adrenaline and the genuine chance of death. It’s pretty fucking hard to keep your wits about you, when you’re probably scared shitless and trying to act professional.</p>
<p>I can’t even begin to imagine how many people in WWII were actually killed by friendlies. It was probably worse in medieval times, running round with swords and armour, only a few colours on your chest plate to distinguish friend from foe.</p>
<p>I just read recently about the British woman that was killed by a US grenade when they tried to rescue her. I’ve seen plenty of criticism of US forced in our media - “the SAS wouldn’t have done that” &amp; “we’d have used flashbangs not frags” or whatever. Wrong. Seriously just wrong. Sure, they could have done something different and yes, it could have turned out a whole variety of ways - but there were more ways it could have gone wrong than right.</p>
