    <title>SSH Webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ssh-webclient/324804</link>
    <description>I need to use SSH from school to access my webserver but I think they have a whitelist policy and only allow port 80 for websites, and maybe a few others. This means I can&#39;t use PuTTY or anything, and normal SSH webclients don&#39;t work because it&#39;s still trying to access a server on port 22, which is blocked.

This website works by proxying the session, but I&#39;d have to pay a subscription and I&#39;m still paranoid about them keeping my details: http://www.gotossh.com/

Is there an app I could put on the server which can be accessed via the web, but does the same thing as normal SSH? I would make it myself, but execution permissions are very difficult in PHP and barely work for me.</description>

              <p>That’s exactly what I was looking for, thanks! I’ll try to get it working, if not then I’ll try hosting on port 443 because I’m pretty sure they allow https.</p>

              <p>There is a PHP-CGI app that will let you ssh to your own server from a web page, with the connection coming from the server, not your client’s computer (in this case the school).  I’ve never tried it, but it seems to be what you want.</p>
<p>edit: I can’t find the program you are looking for, but you could write your own with this fairly easily:<br>

I’ll try to find the one you want though…</p>
<p>edit2: They probably allow HTTPS too, right? (port 443) Set ssh to listen over that? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Well as I say, I think they have a whitelist policy because I’ve tried a few ports and only 80 works (which is web, and I have a webserver…).</p>
<p>Are there any port ranges windows must have open to use the internet which I can use?</p>
