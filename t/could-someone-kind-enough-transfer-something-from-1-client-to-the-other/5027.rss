    <title>Could someone kind enough transfer something from 1 client to the other?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/could-someone-kind-enough-transfer-something-from-1-client-to-the-other/5027</link>
    <description>i really need tog et mage and range on my server but wheneber i do it seems to turn out horibly wrong....

i was wondering if someone could put the mage and range from one client.java into another so that it works? they are both compatable because they are both whitescape based?


take mage and range from  &quot;client2copyfrom.java&quot; and put it in &quot;client2beputin2&quot; and then upload please?
would somone do it?</description>
