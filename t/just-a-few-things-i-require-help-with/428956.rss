    <title>Just a few things i require help with</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-a-few-things-i-require-help-with/428956</link>
    <description>Ok firstly i would like to know a decent ::dice command for donators so i was just wondering if anyone has one or can point me in the right direction. My second request is how can i code a vote4reward for my website which generates a auth code which then can be used instantly ingame. finally how do i make a donator shop on the website so when a player donates to the game they can recieve their ingame item instantly by talking to someone. Thanks but google searches and searches on herehave led to no luck.</description>

Not sure what your donator thing is just change it or tell me what it is on your server. This is for PI :L[/quote]<br>

For the first part, it’s just a matter of using a random number generator, and requiring the user to be a donator to use the command.</p>
<p>For the second part, it might be a bit more complicated. You would have to verify that the paypal transaction was successful, and after that add the generated code to the player’s list of available codes (so that they can’t tell the code to their friend and duplicate the reward).</p>
<p>The third part is almost identical to the second in that after they donate (through Paypal), it adds the player to the Donator’s group, and refreshes the donator group in-game so that they don’t need to cycle out.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You’d need a MySql database for both the second and third requests wouldn’t you? :L You could do the last one with a ::claim command instead, that’d probably be easier :L So it’d work as on the donate page you need to put in a username. Then once you pay it’d write the name into a file and then when the player typed ::claim it’d remove them from file. It’d also write like for example “Matt 1050 1” and it’d work like item :L but it’d be like a temporary ::item.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, a database would certainly make it easier, but it’s certainly not the only way. You could send the update directly to the server, but that would make the server even more bulky.</p>
<p>As for claiming the prize, you would have to make sure that the people who had access to the list wouldn’t abuse it. It would be more ideal to use a database because otherwise you would have to read the entire file, add the entries to a list, remove the specified entry, and then write the file again.</p>
