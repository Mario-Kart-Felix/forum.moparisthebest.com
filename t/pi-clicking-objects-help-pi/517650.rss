    <description>Hello everyone, so there are some objects in my server that only allow you use them from distance. For example, if I click on a staircase in CastleWars while I&#39;m standing right in front of it, nothing happens, but it will let me use it if I am 3+ squares away from it. I&#39;m not sure what files we need to look at so if you know the answer, please help me out, or if you need to see a file, just ask. Thanks!</description>
