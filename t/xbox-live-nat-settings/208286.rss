    <title>Xbox LIVE - NAT settings</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xbox-live-nat-settings/208286</link>
    <description>My NAT is at moderate ATM, which means i can only join certain people. I learned how to set my NAT to open, and i did. I tested connection and my NAT was on open, and i could join everyone. 

But each time i restart my router, my NAT goes back to moderate, anyone know how i could keep it staying on Open?

I&#39;m on a DLINK router, i don&#39;t know the model, but i could find out if it would help.

The rules i applied to make NAT open are still applied, and UPnP still enabled. It was open the first time, so why isn&#39;t it still open :|?</description>
