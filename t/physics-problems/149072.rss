    <description>The teacher never teaches or gives up tips to solving any problems. But, he gives us the answer to the problem, and we have to show work to get that answer. If you guys can share with me some tips and pointers, I&#39;ll gladly appreciate your support. So here:



1. Your odometer reads 23,552.6 mi when you begin a trip at 0817.0 hours. If your average speed is 58.4 mi/hr and you travel until 1522.8 hrs, what does the odometer read now?
The answer 23,967.1 mi.


2. It takes you 12.2 seconds to accelerate from rest to a speed of 125 km/hr.
(a) What distance do you travel in this time? 212 m
(b) What is your average speed for this time interval? 17.4 m/s


3. A rock is thrown at an angle of 35.0[sup]o[/sup] to the horizontal with a speed of 11.5 m/s. How far does it travel?

4. The average acceleration of the shuttle during its 7.5 minute run is 
18 m/s[sup]2[/sup]. What velocity does it theoretically achieve at the end of that time?</description>

              <p>here’s <span class="hashtag">#1:</span><br>
First you need to find the time elapsed in the trip, it uses military time so dont be confused!<br>
(1522.8 hrs - 0817.0) hrs / 100 = 7.05 hours (you divide it by 100 to find actual time elapsed)<br>
distance = avgvel * time<br>
distance = 58.4 mi/hr * 7.05 hours = 411.72 mi<br>
The odometer started at 23,552.6 mi, so add 411.72 to it to get the new reading<br>
23,552.6mi + 411.72mi = 23,963.7 mi</p>
<p>here’s <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> (hope it helps)<br>
The velocity is 125 km/hr, so you should convert that to the standard m/s<br>
125 km/hr * 1000m/1km * 1hr/3600s = 34.72 m/s<br>
distance = avgvelocity * time<br>
Since you start from rest, your initial velocity = 0<br>
distance = ((34.72 - 0)/2)m/s * 12.2s = 211.79m</p>
<p>Part B:<br>
You already calculated the average velocity:<br>
(vf - vi)/2<br>
which equals: (34.72 - 0)/2 = 17.36 m/s</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#3:</span><br>
This is a projectile motion problem:<br>
First start of by finding the velocity in the x direction and velocity in the y direction:<br>
vx = 11.5<em>cos(35) = 9.42 m/s<br>
vy = 11.5</em>sin(35) = 6.60 m/s</p>
<p>Lets use the equation: vf = vi + at<br>
solve for t = (vf-vi) / a<br>
if you solve for when the velocity in the y direction = 0, you will find the time the rock reaches the highest point, that is half of the throw, and then we can multiply the t by 2, so:</p>
<p>t = (0m/s - 6.6 m/s) / (-9.8 m/s)<br>
t = 0.67s<br>
So the total time of the entire throw = 0.67s * 2 = 1.34s<br>
distance = v<em>t + (1/2)at^2<br>
since acceleration in the x direction = 0, d = vx</em>t<br>
d = 9.42 m/s * 1.34s = 12.62m</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#4:</span> (i’m not sure about this one)<br>
final velocity (vf) = initial velocity (vi) + acceleration<em>time<br>
vf = 0m/s + 18m/s^2</em>(7.5 min * (60s/1min))<br>
vf = 8,100 m/s</p>
<p>Hope it helps</p>
