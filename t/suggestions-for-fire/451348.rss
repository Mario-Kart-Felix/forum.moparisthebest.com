    <title>Suggestions for fire?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestions-for-fire/451348</link>
    <description>So I have this picture of a dragon. I want to make it look like he is breathing fire. I want in the background like a burning city/village type of theme. 

I am not asking for a request just suggestions on how about going about doing it. My PS knowledge is 1.</description>
