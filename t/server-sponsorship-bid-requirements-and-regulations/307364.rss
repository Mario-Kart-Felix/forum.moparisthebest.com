    <title>Server Sponsorship Bid requirements and regulations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-sponsorship-bid-requirements-and-regulations/307364</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t want to over step my boundaries saying that I don&#39;t venture over to this side of the site unless I&#39;m really bored and want to laugh but I believe your Server Sponsorship needs to be more exclusive as you assume it will be, you say that there will never be more than 10 servers on your sponsored list but of these 10 how can you keep the standards up with just your one rule? I suggest that you think about a detailed list of minimum requirements for all servers that will be on your sponsored list.

I propose something along the lines of using:

[ul][li]For a server to be officially sponsored it must be able to handle a minimum of 40 players.[/li]
[li]The server must have a system purely dedicated to the running of the server and any additional aspects of the server.[/li]
[li]The server must have secure methods of storing any information of its users be it their passwords or their items and objects.[/li]
[li]The server must not sell anything, be it elevated status to objects and items[/li]
[li]No malicious code may be used in your server or client.[/li]
[li]The server must meet all above requirements at all times, to keep this standard at random intervals in the week your server will be tested without your knowledge.[/li][/ul]


These are just rough outlines of what I would think could improve the quality of the servers you&#39;re sponsoring, feel free to expand on them (anyone).</description>

The rule about selling objects and items was removed because I can’t really expect them to pay for this out of their pocket when donations or selling items could help.  I personally don’t like it, but I don’t see another way.</p>
<p>The only rule I really care about and won’t change on is the rule about selling staff positions for money or donations, that won’t be tolerated.  The rule about no malicious code should be self explanatory, but I guess we could add it to the requirements for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>They could provide a snippet of code showing their method to encrypt their backups and saves.<br>
They could provide a screenshot of their VPS or Dedicated system if they use a remote desktop viewer tool as most do. / Resolve host and check via the forum tool if it matches their current IP.<br>
40 minimum because who wants a server that laggs at 15 players? Nor does it reflect well if you are sponsoring a server that crashes when you hit 10 players online.[/quote]</p>
<p>Anyone could lie about any of those things, and there would be no way we could tell if they were or were not lying.  And how do we test the 40 player capacity?</p>
