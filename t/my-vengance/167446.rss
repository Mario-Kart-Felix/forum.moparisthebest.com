    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-vengance/167446</link>
    <description>Hey i made vengance and i made it so it hit everyone, but now if someone is like lvl 1 varrock and does vengance everyone even get hit at ghorock by it. 
[code]    attackPlayersWithin(600, 17, 1); [/code]
i think thats it to make it multi
and i got another problem that is, when people are for example out of wildy and someone is in lvl 1
then the guy out of wildy click on the veng emote, then the person in wild gets hit thats dumb
how can i disable that?</description>
