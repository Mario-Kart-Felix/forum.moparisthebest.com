<p>You’re doing 1 divided by 1000, not 1 out of 1000. If you want to look at it that way, put 1/100 into your calculator and it’ll show up as .01% - which you even said yourself is wrong.<br>

so far rsbuddy’s ban rate is like 1:1mil or something.<br>

<p>Lmfao, what? If you mean 1 million people, you’re way off, because more than 300 people have been banned using it.<br>
If you mean $, you’re also way off, because trillions of GP have been made with it. Jagex doesn’t do enough to ban millions of people.[/quote]</p>
<p>Fine, for you who actually does care about the actual numbers and don’t understand <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">ratios</span></span>:<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Examples:</span></span><br>
1:100 get banned for using rsbuddy, depending on the scripts, the <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">ratio</span></span> changes, let’s say an example you were botting dungeoneering by yourself theres <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">about</span></span> 1:1000 change of getting banned, which by percentage is <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">about</span></span> .001% of people get banned.</p>
<p>Let’s say if you were botting something popular to bot like flax, sorcerer’s garden or pest control. The rates go up.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">examples:</span></span></p>
<p>About 1:50 people get banned at pest control (legit or botting it doesn’t matter), 1:25 gets banned for sorcerer’s garden (wayy more people then pest control) again, doesn’t matter legit or not legit, high ban rate. I’m not even going to mention flax, because I am tongue tied at how much the ban rate is.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Basic logic:</span></span><br>
More people bot the activity/skill, higher the odds of getting banned. <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">These ratios are estimates</span></span>, they could be greater or less.</p>
<p>1:100 means 1 to 100, which also means 1 in 100.</p>
