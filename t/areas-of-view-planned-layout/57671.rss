    <description>World: Use the absolute coordinates.
Chunk: uses the region chunk coords and approx coords.


World: will hold the lists of everything such as dropped items and npcs
chunk: will load the npcs in view and what not.

chunk Classes:  The same idea as packet handling except it would use a class based on the region coords.  these classes would hold area specific things such as doors only being openable if you have a key and what not.
will reduce lag, all other servers just use the absolute coords for everything.</description>
