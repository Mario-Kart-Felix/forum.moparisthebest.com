    <title>Making the background of the welcome screen black! PLEASE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-the-background-of-the-welcome-screen-black-please/526162</link>
    <description>Hello! I have recently been hurling my efforts into making my server have a good and wholesome FULL SCREEN interface on startup. Ive gotten far enough that I can make it happen on login if you are not a new player and I have text in a few boxes! My problem right now has been [s]my mother[/s] the fact that the player is able to see through the welcome screen and to the game. Is it possible to make a black background that covers the entire frame?

My code so far.

	public void sendWelcomeScreen() {
		sendInterface(15244, 5993);
		sendString(&quot;Welcome to RuneScape&quot;, 15257);
		sendString(&quot;&quot;, 15258);
		sendString(&quot;Make sure to set up a bank pin.&quot;, 15270);
