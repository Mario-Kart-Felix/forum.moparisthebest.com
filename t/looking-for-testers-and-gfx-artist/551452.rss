    <title>Looking for testers, and GFX artist</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-testers-and-gfx-artist/551452</link>
    <description>Hey, I launched a project 3 months ago, that I&#39;ve been working on consecutively. Me and my friend a month ago had mashed our sources, and clients together and started trying to create a really nice and amazing project people will abosolutely enjoy. There&#39;s only one thing I&#39;m lacking to make this process easier, and quicker. A few testers / players, to report any bugs they find and test the game, give input some more ideas, etc. And I&#39;m looking for someone who can make a logo and or client background. Please get back to me if you&#39;re interested, want to know information, or want to know what our future plans are, and what we&#39;re doing. Thank you much appreciated!
