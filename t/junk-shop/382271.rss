    <description>Hey Guys, I have another question. Well I want to make a shop that players of all rights(mod,regular, donor, and others) can use. The point of this shop is to get players to sell stuff to it and the shop gives them cash, like in a mage shop, you buy the runes, but decided you don&#39;t want them so you sell them back, but instead with this you can sell anything to it and get cash for it. Thanks Guys!   [color=limegreen]-Vhenom[/color]</description>
