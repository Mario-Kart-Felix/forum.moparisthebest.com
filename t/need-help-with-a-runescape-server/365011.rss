    <title>Need help with a Runescape Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-runescape-server/365011</link>
    <description>So Basicly What I need help with is that I need a good Cilent and Source with Donator items has to be a 317 + server . I just made a website * and im trying to make a 24/7 runescape server and get donations to make website a .com . So yea if you guys can give me a good source + client that has a ip changer and that I can set it to a certain ip when people download that will be great. Also I will Be looking for Mods, Admins for my server and site to handle my forums once I get my server up and running. My server will be top once I get everything planned out. So please give me the hottest source hot there and please a working client . Thanks for your help  :)

oh, and never start on anything higher than 317, you get frustrated, ask too many questions and dont know what to do even changing player rights, start at 317, they are simple, self explanitory, fun to code, and its were you start, slowly work your way up from deob 317 to 508, 525, 562 so on so forth, you will still have questions going to higher deobs, but you would at least have learned something from 317s and you might even be able to solve the problem by yourself, trust me, i made that mistake, and im happy with 317s</p>

              <p>no server just turns really good you have to code a lot of shit to make it good it takes time to have a top server im still working on one and it has taken 4 months so far… so if ur looking for old school oceanx source and client is good but if ur looking for a 508 idk too complicated for me</p>
