    <title>New Layout</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-layout/140181</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;ve been meaning to work on a new layout for my website for the longest time and just started making a new one a few days ago.

http://www.pwnds.info/newpwnds/

It will be the replacement for my current layout.
The difference between the sites, however, will be basically everything.  I&#39;m going to code everything myself; no external scripts.

How does it look thus far?  Vedy nice?  What can I work on?  
Thanks.</description>

              <p>I totally forgot I even made this thread; shit.</p>
<p>Alright, thanks for the comments.  Let me respond to them x]</p>
<p>[quote=“xxlegitxx, post:4, topic:140181”]Looks all right.  Couple things though.</p>
<p>top.jpg should have been saved as a gif.  You could have also either made it into two smaller images, with just the quarter circles on either side.  Never been a fan of rounded corners, because they clash with the unrounded edges.[/quote]<br>
I guess if .gif does not sacrifice that much, I’ll get on that.  It’s a bitch to put rounded edges on those, btw.  And I think it’d look annoying.  Meh, maybe I’ll give it a try.</p>
<blockquote>buttonbg.jpg could also have been saved as a gif, and it should have been 1px wide.  I think those menu items are a bit tall for the text inside it.  And maybe the bar could be extended across the width of the page; it looks sorta empty on the right.</blockquote>I'll get on that as well.  It does look empty, but it might be weird just being solid.  Again, I'll look into it.
<blockquote>navtop.jpg should have been a gif, and from the rounded corner, it looks lopsided.</blockquote>
I think that's because I have a sizing issue.  I didn't notice that though.  Quick, easy fix.  Thanks.
<blockquote>The fact that the body background color and the #big background color is the same is slightly annoying</blockquote>
Hah, I thought it was kinda chill.  I like the idea of the white border though that Bang Train suggested.
<blockquote>Everything with one color + white + anti-aliasing should have been a gif.  Well, basically everything except for the cookie monster could have been a gif.  Speaking of which, is that you in the top left corner?  Or is that a girl?</blockquote>
Lmfao, if I was in there, that'd be mad hott, but nah :P  That's a chick, I believe.  I don't know if I was supposed to take that as an insulting comment either, haha.
<blockquote>ID's should be only used once... otherwise it should be a class.</blockquote>
Is that so? :O
<blockquote>I fully intend to brute-force your admin page.</blockquote>
Have fun. ^.^  When you left this comment, the login didn't even work.  Plus, there's nothing there of value, haha.
<blockquote>But li3k total respect for the div layout.</blockquote>
Coordinate positioning saved this layout, hahaha.
<p>[quote=“Bang Train, post:6, topic:140181”]OOOO interesting</p>
<p>You started curves. But abandoned them. You have them on cookie monster and the top of the page, yet none of your nav buttons or the menu on the left or even the footer have them. Be consistent please.[/quote]<br>
Again, I thought they’d be annoying, but I’ll look at it.</p>
<blockquote>The Welcome, Projects, Links are the same color as the background. This looks bad. Make them stand out by either different color or take a while outline around everything from the header to the footer.</blockquote>
I'll most likely do this.
<blockquote>The pixel diffrence between the menu on the left and the header is more then the cookie monster pic and the header.</blockquote>They're different, you're saying?  That was intended.  I didn't think the cookie monster looked good enough.
<blockquote>The buttons are not links. Only the words. I kept trying to click the blue gradients of the button.......</blockquote>
Yeah, I really wanted to make the whole thing, but now that I see the fix ^.^
<blockquote>The space diffrence of the top of the word Home and Welcome is MUCH more then the space diffrence between the bottom of admin and the top of Projects.</blockquote>Is that so?
<blockquote>The uhh lululullululululululullululululululullllllllllllllllll seems the be floating. Its not really contained in anything except a big white space.</blockquote>Yeah? :P  I guess a border wouldn't hurt that part.
<p>Thanks again guys.[quote=“xxlegitxx, post:7, topic:140181”][quote author=Bang Train link=topic=192350.msg1731250#msg1731250 date=1188890396]<br>

[/quote]</p>
<p>True.  I believe setting a:link and a:visited display:block should fix it, which may cause some other minor problems which you could easily fix.  Then again, if you plan on keeping it unsupported for IE6, you could just do it for a.[/quote]Thanks :]</p>

              <p>You can make a layout much better than I can, but I don’t like it man. It just doesn’t seem to mesh well, you know?</p>
<p>The Menu titles seem a little too big and the link titles in the menu titles seem a little small. The big blue buttons don’t seem to go well with the rest of the layout. Seems a little too blue.</p>
