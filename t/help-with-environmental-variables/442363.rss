    <description>Hey, I&#39;m having a little problem with my variable&#39;s.

Im using a windows 7 64 bit operating system

my current settings that aint working..

PATH   C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_03\bin;

CLASSPATH   C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_03\bin;


Im wanting to just play around on a server for fun no one will play just me and my computer but the server wont load on 127.0.0.1 and it is saying this when I run the source&#39;s run  &quot;The system cannot find the path specified.&quot;.

This is what it&#39;s edit is set to.

&quot;C:\Program Files(x86)\Java\jdk1.7.0_3\bin\java.exe&quot;

So what am I doing wrong please help as I want to be able to play around and I cant figure out what im doing wrong at all.

Thanks
