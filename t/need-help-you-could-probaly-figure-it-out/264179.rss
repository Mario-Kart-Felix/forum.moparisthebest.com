    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-you-could-probaly-figure-it-out/264179</link>
    <description>Uhh ya... When I compile and then run delta it keeps saying
on the cmd:

[code]null
null
null
null
null[/code]


And it keeps on going on and on and when I try to log in it&#39;s just a black screen for like 10 seconds and then logs me off. Anyone know how to fix this?</description>

<p>Lmao, I never used delta, yet I know this is the anti-leech because so many noobs have asked this question repeatedly.

              <p>Lmao, I never used delta, yet I know this is the anti-leech because so many noobs have asked this question repeatedly. Either download the source without the anti-leech, or remove the anti-leech manually. If you cannot remove the anti-leech then you are not worthy of using the source. Somebody close this thread.</p>

              <p>Uhh ya… When I compile and then run delta it keeps saying<br>
on the cmd:</p>
<p><code>null

null</code></p>
<p>And it keeps on going on and on and when I try to log in it’s just a black screen for like 10 seconds and then logs me off. Anyone know how to fix this?</p>
