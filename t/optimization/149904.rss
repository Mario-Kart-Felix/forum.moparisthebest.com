    <description>Well, I have alot of un-used methods, arrays, ints, feilds, etc. I need to get rid of them, and I don&#39;t want to go through every single file and see if they are called or not. Can somebody show me how to use ProGuard? It&#39;s been really confusing to me, and I tried to reading about it. Add my msn to talk or talk on here.
