    <title>Oh My God. Girl throws puppies into a river</title>

    <description>[size=25pt][b]If you can&#39;t handle animal abuse don&#39;t watch it.[/b][/size] 
I myself watched like 10 seconds, then I shut it off.
Annnnyyways,
A video was posted on youtube showing a girl throwing puppies into a river, now deleted but it is still on the net. 4chan quickly spread it on /b/, and I guess they found the girl and I guess they are harassing her, hacking her facebook account, ect.

Discuss.

I mean c’mon whats up with this sick bitch!!! And I totally agree with Mrs Silab and Mopar, if they have something wrong with them they should be shotten, put to “sleep” or other things should be done to prevent any serious pain, but this, this is just sick.

Every living thing on this earth has the right to live! Killing off something without giving it a fighting change is inhumane. Sure, If the animal is majorly sick and has like a 1 in a million change to survive, I can understand, You are putting it out of its misery. As for these puppies, Did you see how fat they were? These puppies were <span class="bbcode-b">WELL</span> taken care of, and had no reason to be thrown in that river. Did you hear their whine? This means the puppies were not dehydrated at all. These puppies were healthy as a fucking horse, besides worms (FYI - All puppies are born with worms). This just shows how heartless you are Silab, you are now on, and forever will be, my hated list. You are now one of 4 people on that list, (Only person on this forum). Stop poking your nose in where it will offense tons, and are so heartless about. You do not ‘own’ animals, you simply take care of them.[/quote]</p>

Those puppies are not the same. Look at how flat the hair it while they are in the bucket, and how fluffy they are in the womens home. She is just looking for some ‘fame’ and free money.</p>

<p>I completely agree that there are legitimate reasons for killing animals.  Maybe they are sick, starving, have horrible deformities or any number of other reasons.  But there is no reason to kill animals this way, at least do it humanely, like shoot them in the head for example.  I watched the video, it’s pretty messed up.[/quote]</p>
<p>Or even better, shoot the fucking girl in the head.</p>
