    <title>I need help removing the attack option when you aren&#39;t in the wildy</title>

    <description>Ok so when you are outside of wildy in my server it still show the attack option and it&#39;s very annoying because if you want to walk towards somebody, you have to right click and click walk here every time because if you click near them it will say attack. Here is my code to make the attack option: [code]
            outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
            outStream.writeByteC(3); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
            outStream.writeByteA(1); // 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context 

menu
            outStream.writeString(&quot;Attack&quot;);
            outStream.endFrameVarSize();
            IsInWilderness = true;
[/code]

That is the code for the attack option. I want to make it so when you&#39;re in the wildy or at my funpk it says attack but outside of wildy it doesn&#39;t so I tried this: [code]if(funPk())
{
            outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
            outStream.writeByteC(3); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
            outStream.writeByteA(1); // 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context 

menu
            outStream.writeString(&quot;Attack&quot;);
            outStream.endFrameVarSize();
            IsInWilderness = true;
}[/code]

But that still didn&#39;t work So then I tried the opposite. I tried making it say if you are not in a non wild area it will show the attack option: [code]if(!nonWild())
{
            outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
            outStream.writeByteC(3); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
            outStream.writeByteA(1); // 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context 

menu
            outStream.writeString(&quot;Attack&quot;);
            outStream.endFrameVarSize();
            IsInWilderness = true;
}[/code]

but that still didn&#39;t work. How do I make it so when your in the wildy it shows the attack option but when you&#39;re not in it, it removes the attack option and just says walk here?</description>

              <p>How would I put it into my client? There’s no if statements for this [code]            outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);<br>

<p>EDIT: Ok I tried changing it to this (I am testing it on my funpk first): <code>if(funPk())
{
            setOption("Attack", 3, 1);
} else { setOption("null", 3, 1);
}</code></p>
<p>All that did was remove the attack option completely. I saved a backup so…</p>
