    <title>The PPP Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-ppp-development/440541</link>
    <description>The PPP Development or The Perfect PI Project Development is a non-hosted project that I have  recently started. 

[center]Our Objective[/center]
The objective of The PPP Development is to develop by far the most efficient PI up to date. We will not  be focusing on adding the newer revision items/contents. On the other hand though we plan to work on the current  content and improve it to be more efficient, work properly, and to overall create a better  source to begin with.

[center]The Team[/center]
-Loveandpoiwer - Main Developer: Develops and improves the overall skills combat, and other content which is wherein already added.
-OPEN - Core Developer: - While I do know some stuff about the core after several hours of reading up tutorials I would like to still get a  real java professional who understands the cores importance and who knows how to make the core  be as functional and perform at the highest standard possible. Current applications are being took for the position. The core developer should not   have to spend as much time on the project. In reality, the project will most likely  be done in a couple of weeks after I have done all skills to make sure they are functional and as improved as possible.

[center]The Application[/center]
Position : Core Developer
What type of related experience do you have that makes you believe you are  best fit for this position? 
Can you supply proof of this experience? 
Define in your own words what makes up the core and what major  factors ( rsps wise I guess...to stay specific) you believe affect the core mostly?
If hired on, what changes would you do to the core and why?
Comments:

[center]The Credits[/center]

-Int Buuk - Source being used, high level of credits should be given to him as he has  redone several factors of the  server.
-Loveandpower - For current and future developing 
-Whoever gets core developer
-Whoever else who wishes to  take credits who deserve it.</description>
