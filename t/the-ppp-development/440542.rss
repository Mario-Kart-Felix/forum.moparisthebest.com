    <title>The PPP Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-ppp-development/440542</link>
    <description>The PPP Development or The Perfect PI Project Development is a non-hosted project that I have  recently started. 

[center]Our Objective[/center]
The objective of The PPP Development is to develop by far the most efficient PI up to date. We will not  be focusing on adding the newer revision items/contents. On the other hand though we plan to work on the current  content and improve it to be more efficient, work properly, and to overall create a better  source to begin with.

[center]The Team[/center]
-Loveandpoiwer - Main Developer: Develops and improves the overall skills combat, and other content which is wherein already added.
Core Developer: - While I do know some stuff about the core after several hours of reading up tutorials I would like to still get a  real java professional who understands the cores importance and who knows how to make the core  be as functional and perform at the highest standard possible. Current applications are being took for the position. The core developer should not   have to spend as much time on the project. In reality, the project will most likely  be done in a couple of weeks after I have done all skills to make sure they are functional and as improved as possible.

[center]The Updates[/center]

-PickupItems packet redone to properly pick  up  items, fixed a dupe  with this packet as well.
-Fixed up most of the server to be de-bug friendly.
-rewrote player following to be done properly ( credits to paladino as well for original base)
-rewrote npc walking, npc do not clip now, they do not go through walls, other static objects, etc, npc&#39;s are now clipped when attacking so if you move away  they can&#39;t attack  by going through objects etc.(still a little buggy)
-Rewrote slayer as it was good  but a  little  messy to me ;)

[center]The Credits[/center]

-Int Bauk - Source being used, high level of credits should be given to him as he has  redone several factors of the  server.
-Loveandpower - For current and future developing 
-Whoever gets core developer
-Whoever else who wishes to  take credits who deserve it.</description>

<p>-Also note: There won’t be any real media for this… there is no unique content in this. I am  just improving what is  already on here.</p>
