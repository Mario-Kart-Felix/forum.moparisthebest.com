    <title>Hackers Hacked my Server, Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hackers-hacked-my-server-help/245830</link>
    <description>I just finished hosting my first server, and a couple of minutes in someone logged in and started spamming 

&quot;YOUR SERVER IS UNDER ATTACK! PLEASE REMAIN CALM!&quot;

As he was doing that he was creating a load of accounts, the same name but a different number at the end. It went up to 70 then i finally ended up IP banning him.

Thats not all... A couple of more minutes later, someone CHANGED their character rights to 3 ( Owner ) and his brothers ( Same IP in the character logs )

He demoted me, then IP banned me... WTF??

What do i do now?.... I cant log in, un-ban myself or anything..
I think i need a new source or re-install right?

Can anyone tell me what i have to do so that doesn&#39;t happen again? Thanks.</description>

My, your server sucks.[/quote]</p>
<p>His server doesn’t suck dude…And you’re not getting hacked…The problem is IF you downloaded a pre-made source and you edited it and made stuff and such…The original guy who coded that server and released probably put in his client.java that when a certain name (his name) logs onto that server, his char rights automatically go to 3. I use an allstarscape source and the original guy who coded it his name was Mod Allstar…If that name logged on he would automatically be made owner. I ip banned him and removed from the client.java where if he logs on it gives him owner rights.</p>
<p>EDIT: You don’t have to get rid of the source because some nerd is pushing you to do it…Push HIM out of the server.</p>

              <p>Best thing to do when this happens is to pull the server offline. Remember, you have more power over the server than they do, because you have all of the data files locally, plus the source.</p>
<p>In addition to what X Screech X said, you can also modify your source so that it automatically kicks anyone with his IP. That might be a good thing to do, since it is already compiled into the source, and therefore unmodifiable.</p>
