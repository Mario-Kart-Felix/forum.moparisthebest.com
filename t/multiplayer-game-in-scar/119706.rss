    <description>Multiplayer Game in SCAR

This could be done. People have already made games in SCAR, and a lot of us know server script languages like PHP. If we could use both skills together, we could make a sweet Multiplayer game.

Example:

Make a script which is a 2D fighting game. You can verse the computer or a player across the net.

Choose to verse a player across the net and the script connects to say...
http://www.scarscriptersserver.com/fight.php?p=search-for-players

That page could have a list of IP addresses, and say you selected IP address 1.1.1.1 the fight would then start.
http://www.scarscriptersserver.com/fight.php?f=YOUR-IP-vs-1.1.1.1

Each time a player moved their character or did anything to affect the game, the input would be sent across the web and saved to a txt file which the above mentioned page would be read by both your script and the opponents script. Once each script keeps constantly connecting to the page for more input, it would be showing each of the characters moving on each computer following the input from the txt file. 

The input could be something like this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;YOUR-IP: UP [jump]
YOUR-IP: CTRL [punch]
OTHERIP: RIGHT
YOUR-IP: CTRL [punch]
YOUR-IP: Inflicted 10 damage
OTHERIP: RIGHT
OTHERIP: RIGHT&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This won&#39;t be easy and what I am talking about is just 1 idea to do it. It may get complicated and may chew up a bit of bandwith, but at least it&#39;s an idea and it&#39;s feasible. :)

Hope someone can do it! I&#39;ll try to work something like this and if I get any more interesting ideas I&#39;ll try to post. If you&#39;re wondering what the hell I&#39;m talking about, feel free to post.</description>
