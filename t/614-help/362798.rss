    <description>[size=14pt]Hello I am currently hosting a 614 server, like 99% of them magic doesn&#39;t work. If anyone know&#39;s what file and what the code is to put it in. I am gladly giving co-owner. Cause, I&#39;m sure if you know how to do that you can code most of the things I need coded. Started this server yesterday, and already 61 downloads.
