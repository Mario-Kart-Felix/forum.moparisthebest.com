    <description>Okay, I&#39;m making my server...

And as usual, There&#39;s problems.


I&#39;m using winterlove and Galkons client base

1. I can edit galkons sprites, But theydon&#39;t change at all on the client.
2. I have a serious item null problem.

-Most of the items I have in turn into nulls, this seems to be from 07956+, They all turn into nulls when spawned. The rest are fine. The ones in the Class8.java don&#39;t turn into nulls instantly,  but do if you say move an item, Wear it etc. If I have more than one item in the class8. in my invent - Moving something will change them all into nulls...

How do I fix this, I don&#39;t want all my items turning into nulls

I&#39;ll add my other questions later, Only if this null problem is fixed</description>

<li>Try going to the bank and see if the srpites change there. alot of sprites dont show up untill you open a bank (make every sprite the same not just 1)  so if you changes the magic book change all 2 or 3 magic books or you will not see them</li>
