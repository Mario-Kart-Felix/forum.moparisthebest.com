    <title>Modeling question, blender, not sure where to post this question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/modeling-question-blender-not-sure-where-to-post-this-question/315689</link>
    <description>  well i hope i&#39;m posting in the right area,
anyways, here&#39;smy question.

i never really opened and edited a ruenscape/jagex model,
     so now, i tried looking in my friends old p server files,
  and i found some folder with &quot;models&quot; and they were all in winrar.
i didnt everything, including extracting them, but i couldn&#39;t open up the files in blender

my question is:
  where do i find the jagex models so that i can edit/re-color them?

please,
  i would rep++ you if i could ;]  (i mean to the one who answers)  but i can&#39;t xD</description>
