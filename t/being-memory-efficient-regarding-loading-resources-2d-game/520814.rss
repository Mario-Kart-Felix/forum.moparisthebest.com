    <title>Being memory efficient regarding loading resources (2D game)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/being-memory-efficient-regarding-loading-resources-2d-game/520814</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got some questions about the best way to handle loading resources regarding a 2D tile based game (think LoZ:LttP). I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do with it, but if one of these is by far better practice than the others and someone with more experience making these type of games could point it out to me, I&#39;d be greatly thankful for the knowledge.


Loading a map that is split into regions, I can see a few possibilities:


[ul][li]Have all regions in memory at all times. This is probably the easiest, but also seems the most memory inefficient.[/li]
[li]Only store the active region in memory, when moving to a new region load it quickly from its file and discard the old one from memory. This is also a very easy to implement solution, and the most memory efficient, but it could be slightly bad if the regions take a (relative) while to load from file. [/li]
[li]Store the active region and any referenced regions (ones located North/South/East/West, as well as any that could be called from action objects like entering a house or cave) in memory. When entering a new region it should already be stored in memory, and then you load the new referenced regions from file.[/li][/ul]


And depending on which solution I use there, it also ties into how I&#39;d load the tile set images:

[ul][li]Have all tileset images and information  loaded into memory (on disk all of the tilesets are 2.28mb, but I have no idea what that translates to in BufferedImage format when loaded into Java)[/li]
[li]Have all tileset [i]information[/i] (tile width/height, resource path, transparency color, etc) loaded into memory for all tilesheets, but only load the resource image and create the different tile sprites when the sheet will be referenced by a loaded region.[/li]
[li]Load the referenced tilesheets from scratch each time a new region is loaded[/li][/ul]


Thoughts? I&#39;m leaning towards the second option in both instances.</description>

<p>When switching a region in GTA3 you had to load every building, sprites, missions, care packages etc etc. They decided to cache it for use instead of loading/disposing as you moved. Which they do with graphics as you would notice a certain amount of cars in your area and no more. If you stopped traffic and turned and looked back again the traffic was gone. Not to mention which changing islands they wanted you to feel like it was a long distance. Remember it was a huge jump from GTA2 so they couldn’t get it perfect <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Edit : Oh I also forgot it may have something to do with reading from the disk as well <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

I would set the unload threshold at 10-15 squares. If you have small regions just keep the nearby ones loaded constantly. Loading during the transition works fine too, as long as the loading is fast. Don’t do like the early GTAs where you have those long loading screen between islands<br>

<p>Irrelevant. The long loading screen was required. It took longer to start up but the performance was 100x better. They knew what they were doing.[/quote]<br>
GTA 3 and Vice City required it but San Andreas didn’t? All 3 were built on the same generation of consoles.</p>

What if they keep crossing over that 5 square distance line? I guess there is a way that could work, but personally I think loading during a transition (either when you enter the region or preloading) is still the best bet.</p>
<p>EDIT - I’m just going to do a quick benchmark and maybe upload the code and a map file so others can tell me exactly how long it does take to load a region, and I’ll base my choice on that.</p>

Like I hinted at in the OP, each region has an array of referenced tileset IDs. When I load a new region, the list of current referenced tilesets is cross referenced with the list of referenced tilesets from the new region. Any duplicates are kept, and any others are unloaded. Then the rest of the tilesets that haven’t been loaded for the new region are processed.</p>

<p>How important is memory efficiency? If it isn’t alfa-omega. I would suggest a similar system as I suggested, but only unload when a certain time have passed, or you’ve reached a set limit of regions.</p>

The camera moves along with the player until you reach the edge of a region (the regions can be larger than the screen width), and then once you reach the edge or whatever it fades out really quick and you are moved to a different region. The closest representation I could find:<br>

Notice how when he reaches the top the camera stops moving and when he gets to the very edge it moves him into the next region</p>

              <p>In Uni we learned to base our 2D game on an a specific amount of memory. We were assigned a random computer build and had to determine the amount of available memory we were given to work with. Some people had 512mb of ram, others had 384KB etc etc. In the early days… and Blizzard still amazes me with how flawless starcraft II is… games were based on the capabilities of the computers in that era. It’s still appropriate to be efficient as possible. The “add more RAM” is completely ignorant and irrelevant. Although memory is extremely cheap now a days… we should still learn efficiency.</p>
<p>With that being said you should determine the amount of memory you want to hold yourself to before you start. If you could get a hold of an old windows 98 computer and use it to test your game as you progress. You can find old computers on craigslist for free.</p>

Map = The entire game map, there is only 1 instance of this in the entire game<br>
Region = Subsections of the map, can be huge like a city or forest, or tiny like a small</p>
<p>So basically while most games would go World -&gt; Map -&gt; Region, I just go Map -&gt; Region, with Map being what most would call World and Region what most would call Map.</p>
<p>So assuming ‘map’ means region for me, the first point you made would basically be the same as the second bullet in mine right? Because that’s what I’m currently planning on doing. Cache on demand sounds interesting, but probably more for something like sprites instead of the map.</p>

              <p>I’ve got some questions about the best way to handle loading resources regarding a 2D tile based game (think LoZ:LttP). I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do with it, but if one of these is by far better practice than the others and someone with more experience making these type of games could point it out to me, I’d be greatly thankful for the knowledge.</p>
<p>Loading a map that is split into regions, I can see a few possibilities:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Have all regions in memory at all times. This is probably the easiest, but also seems the most memory inefficient.[/li]<br>
[li]Only store the active region in memory, when moving to a new region load it quickly from its file and discard the old one from memory. This is also a very easy to implement solution, and the most memory efficient, but it could be slightly bad if the regions take a (relative) while to load from file. [/li]<br>
[li]Store the active region and any referenced regions (ones located North/South/East/West, as well as any that could be called from action objects like entering a house or cave) in memory. When entering a new region it should already be stored in memory, and then you load the new referenced regions from file.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>And depending on which solution I use there, it also ties into how I’d load the tile set images:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Have all tileset images and information  loaded into memory (on disk all of the tilesets are 2.28mb, but I have no idea what that translates to in BufferedImage format when loaded into Java)[/li]<br>
[li]Have all tileset <span class="bbcode-i">information</span> (tile width/height, resource path, transparency color, etc) loaded into memory for all tilesheets, but only load the resource image and create the different tile sprites when the sheet will be referenced by a loaded region.[/li]<br>
[li]Load the referenced tilesheets from scratch each time a new region is loaded[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Thoughts? I’m leaning towards the second option in both instances.</p>
