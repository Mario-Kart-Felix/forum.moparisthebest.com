I don&#39;t understand what this is or how to fix it. But you can see the usernames and how my actual name is something different. I am also level 126 but sometimes appears as level 1&quot; or level 0&quot;. But in the combat interface i&#39;m shown as level 126 so that is fine... :S
I have tried searching these random names in the server + client but nothing comes up. I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a random string named something else. This is a mix source/client between deception v2 and process pk bases. I have also deleted the skill &quot;summoning.&quot; Which may affected the cmb viewed.

Has anyone ever experienced this issue? :S</description>
