    <title>Electoral College? Thoughts?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/electoral-college-thoughts/468217</link>
    <description>I know a lot of people, for some reason, think the Electoral College voting system is a good process. I believe it&#39;s just a horrible idea, as it gives the win to a majority of one state. This has caused many many problems with previous elections, and the wrong person being put into office, appose to the person who should. Take this example..

There are five states, these are the population of the states.

State 1 - 80 people
State 2 - 130 people
State 3 - 40 people
State 4 - 100 people
State 5 - 60 people

5 people = 1 electoral vote

State 1 has 16 Electoral Votes
State 2 has 26 Electoral Votes
State 3 has 8 Electoral Votes
State 4 has 20 Electoral Votes
State 5 has 12 Electoral Votes

There are two people running for office, candidate 1 and candidate 2. To win the election, they need at least 42 electoral votes. Candidate 1 wins States 1 and 2. Candidate 2 wins States 3, 4, and 5.

Count them up here is the total:
Candidate 1 = 42 Electoral Votes
Candidate 2 = 40 Electoral Votes

Candidate 1 wins, correct? With the Electoral College, yes.

Personally, I think everyone should vote individually for a candidate, and tally up all of the votes, and let the winner be based on that. 
State 1 - 80 people
State 2 - 130 people
State 3 - 40 people
State 4 - 100 people
State 5 - 60 people

Say in State 1, this happens:
39 people vote for candidate 1 - 41 people vote for candidate 2

State 2, this happens:
74 people vote for candidate 1 - 46 people vote for candidate 2

State 3, this happens:
30 people vote for candidate 1 - 10 people vote for candidate 2

State 4, this happens:
20 people vote for candidate 1 - 80 people vote for candidate 2

State 5, this happens:
5 people vote for candidate 1 - 55 people vote for candidate 2

Tally it all up and here are the results.
Candidate 1 Citizen votes: 166
Candidate 2 Citizen votes: 250

This being, people clearly want candidate 2 to win, however, due to the electoral college, candidate 1 has won, due to majority rules. What do you guys think on this topic?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>The system is flawed, yes. But the electoral votes are determined from the vote of the people. The candidate that gets a majority of the votes of the people for a particular state, gets all of the available electoral votes. An improvement would be to either divide it into congressional districts, or even counties per state, and have the votes settled that way. That’s why the United States is not a democracy, it is a democratic republic. If every person had to vote, and all votes that were cast in the nation were to be authorized, validated, and counted, it would simply take too much effort, and too much time to get anything done.</p>
