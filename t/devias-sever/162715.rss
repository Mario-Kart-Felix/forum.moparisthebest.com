Proof is needed without proof you&#39;ll get declined no matter what the other stuff says.
Experience is also needed without that also you&#39;ll get declined.

Info:
As Forums Mod you must be active but not as much as an administrator.

As Forums Admin you must be active at least 5+ hours if not more.

Server Mod must be active if there are no admins available(depending how long and when the server is up provided by the hoster)

Server Admins must always be online if owner or co-owner aren&#39;t online(depending how long and when the server is up provided by the hoster) 

Coders must have really good experience with sites(including SMF IpbFree Freewebs spruz and many more) must provide server with a decent logo, good with SMF coding (not smfforfree).

Thankes
