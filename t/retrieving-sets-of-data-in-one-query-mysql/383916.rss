    <description>EDIT: Probably should start at this post: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,479678.msg3514385.html#msg3514385

Alright, this is partially hard for me to explain.  I don&#39;t really know if there is a &quot;term&quot; for it, but whatever, heregoes.  

I have a table with some data like &quot;string&quot;, &quot;total_views&quot;, &quot;views_in_10min&quot;, &quot;views_in_24hrs&quot;.  I, with one query, want to get the top 5 of &quot;total_views&quot;, &quot;views_in_10min&quot;, &quot;views_in_24hrs&quot;.  

I&#39;m finding it rather difficult.  People have been trying to show me examples, but I&#39;m just unable to get them.  I was referred to http://thenoyes.com/littlenoise/?p=36 but I don&#39;t understand it and cannot apply it to my current problem.

Thanks dawgs</description>

              <p>The new code doesn’t look dirty. You’ve normalized your database structure a bit more, which is the good part about it, but you should be using one table for all of your view data. This will allow you to choose more ranges of view data when you need it freely accessible.</p>
<p>Following your recent post, I would suggest you make a view table with a timestamp which specifies the time in which that view was initiated. When you want to select a range of the last 10 minutes, you would write the WHERE clause with a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_between.asp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">BETWEEN</a> functionality. This will allow you to select views between two timestamps and associate them with the like ID.</p>
<p>10 mins: SELECT likes.id,likes.text,count(views.id) AS view_count FROM likes, views WHERE likes.id = views.likeid AND timestamp BETWEEN <span class="bbcode-b">UNIX_TIMESTAMP()-600</span> AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() GROUP BY likes.id ORDER BY view_count DESC</p>
<p>30 mins: SELECT likes.id,likes.text,count(views.id) AS view_count FROM likes, views WHERE likes.id = views.likeid AND timestamp BETWEEN <span class="bbcode-b">UNIX_TIMESTAMP()-1800</span> AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() GROUP BY likes.id ORDER BY view_count DESC</p>
<p>24 hours: SELECT likes.id,likes.text,count(views.id) AS view_count FROM likes, views WHERE likes.id = views.likeid AND timestamp BETWEEN <span class="bbcode-b">UNIX_TIMESTAMP()-86400</span> AND UNIX_TIMESTAMP() GROUP BY likes.id ORDER BY view_count DESC</p>
<p>total: SELECT likes.id,likes.text,count(views.id) AS view_count FROM likes, views WHERE likes.id = views.likeid GROUP BY likes.id ORDER BY view_count DESC</p>

              <p>Thanks for that, Zachera.  I thought I’ve explained my issue well enough, but I will do my best here, then yano, put a note say “this post is probably better to read than the entirety of the thread.”</p>
<p>Simply, what I wanted was to see if I could get multiple sets of data in one query, all from the same table.  The sets of data would be relatively the same, just different constraints were added to each set (I.E. get x sets which have the highest views in the past 10 minutes, get x sets which have the highest views in the past 30 minutes, etc.)</p>
<p>We will refer to the sets of data as “likes”.  All it is, is an id and text, mostly.  That is its own table, blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I did rework everything though.  I made it more “normalized”, if that’s the word for it haha.  I have four tables now.<br>
The last 3 are the 10m_views, 30m_views, 24h_views.  They are described as ‘id’, the id of the like, and ‘views’, the amount of views that like has.  It will be incremented (view = view + 1) each time the like is viewed independently.</p>
<p>So, there’s going to be a single record in these three tables per like that will hold the data representing how many views.</p>
<p>I was told that “multiple queries” isn’t necessarily resource intensive, but I figured there was a better way.  This is what I have CURRENTLY:</p>
<p>[code=php]<br>
$queries = array(“SELECT likes.id, text, 10m_views.views FROM likes, 10m_views WHERE likes.id = 10m_views.id ORDER BY views DESC” . $limit,<br>
“SELECT likes.id, text, 30m_views.views FROM likes, 30m_views WHERE likes.id = 30m_views.id ORDER BY views DESC” . $limit,<br>
“SELECT likes.id, text, 24h_views.views FROM likes, 24h_views WHERE likes.id = 24h_views.id ORDER BY views DESC” . $limit<br>
);</p>
<pre><code>	foreach ($queries as $query) {
		$stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare($query);
		if ($stmt-&gt;execute()) {
			while ($res = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
				$arr[] = array($res['id'], $res['text']);
			}		
		}	
		$stmt = NULL;
	}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>That looks dirty to me, but whatever.  Any input on what I have now or how I described it?</p>

              <p>Your vague explanation of what you need help with makes it harder for others to understand what you need help with. Maybe you should rewrite the topic and go in-depth about every specific detail so that we can get an understanding? I’ll explain a solution though, based on my interpretation.</p>
<p>It seems like you have a video website where you want to display the most viewed, most viewed in 30 days, etc. The way I explain below will be based on my interpretation, so hopefully you won’t get confused.</p>
<p>Normalizing the database, like nade mentioned, would be the proper solution. While it may seem like you would be overflowing any particular table, you would actually be organizing your data effectively. By normalizing your database, you are organizing your data effectively and connecting pieces together without getting too much data intertwined in one table. It’s very important to separate data into tables effectively in MySQL and connect them with <span class="bbcode-b">foreign keys</span> so that you aren’t getting data result sets with more data than you really need. For example, what if you wanted to get database information for views, but nothing related to the actual video for that view? What if you wanted only video data but no view counts? It’s important to outline what your requirements are and ensure that you’re not getting more data than you need.</p>
<p>A solution to the issue you’re having would simply be to reorganize your table structure(s).<br>
I would suggest you effectively put videos into one table (tbl_Video) and views into another table (tbl_View).<br>
tbl_Video should contain all of the video data, such as VideoID, Title, URL, Uploaded By, DateCreated, etc.<br>
tbl_View should contain all of the view data: ViewID, VideoID, IP, Referer, DateCreated, etc.</p>
<p>I added IP and Referer to tbl_View table to better explain my solution. DateCreated in tbl_Video is vitally necessary, as we’ll be using it in this example.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of MySQL is that you have the ability to specify which columns you want to have in your result set. It’s very crucial to take advantage of this – personally, I never use “SELECT <span class="bbcode-b">*</span> FROM…” – because you will find that it’s a lot easier to get only what you want and nothing more.</p>
<p>With that said, we can now start building our queries. All of it will be explained.</p>
<p>SELECT Video.Title, Video.URL, Video.UploadedBy, Video.DateCreated, COUNT(View.ViewID) AS Views FROM tbl_Video AS Video, tbl_View AS View WHERE View.VideoID = Video.VideoID AND View.DateCreated BETWEEN “2011-01-01” AND “2011-01-31” GROUP BY Video.VideoID</p>
<p>This query selects data from the two tables – Video and View. Each block is explained below.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">SELECT Video.Title, Video.URL, Video.UploadedBy, Video.DateCreated, COUNT(View.ViewID) AS Views</span><br>
We select the video data from the Video table, as well as the amount of Views (by counting the View records returned in the result set).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">FROM tbl_Video AS Video, tbl_View AS View</span><br>
We specify which tables we get data from, then setting them up as ‘Video’ and ‘View’ as their alias (so we don’t have to do SELECT tbl_Video.Title, tbl_Video.URL, etc).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">WHERE View.VideoID = Video.VideoID AND View.DateCreated BETWEEN “2011-01-01” AND “2011-01-31”</span><br>
We be sure to match the Views to the Video as well as selecting a date-range for which the Views were added (or, created).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">GROUP BY Video.VideoID</span><br>
We group the results by VideoID, meaning that each View will go to their respective Video rather than scattering across to the wrong videos.</p>
<p>By utilizing the functionality of normalizing your database structure, you give yourself very specific focuses on which result sets you want and which result sets you don’t want when displaying data on a website. You ultimately avoid redundancy and are left with a structure that allows for flexibility amongst each normalized aspect of the table. Adding new features which are specific to only one of the two tables is better than adding more complexity to simply just one table all by itself.</p>

<p>The LITERAL time of the view is redundant, but I think you were just using that as an example.  I just need the counts.</p>
<p>I think creating a new row per view would be ridiculous as well.  I’m not entirely sure how MySQL works, but for some reason I think that would be a huge overhead on retrieving the amount of views.</p>
<p>My table looks like:<br>
id, text, total_views, views_10min, views_30min, views_24hrs</p>
<p>And what I ultimately want to do is get the top (#) of the 3 end view amounts and return the 3 * # in a single query.  I also wish to ignore duplicate data, if that could be weaseled in there without php intervention.</p>

Only returns 10, but I think I know why lol…  Probably because the 10_min and 30_min data is the same.</p>

<p>Alright, this is partially hard for me to explain.  I don’t really know if there is a “term” for it, but whatever, heregoes.</p>
<p>I have a table with some data like “string”, “total_views”, “views_in_10min”, “views_in_24hrs”.  I, with one query, want to get the top 5 of “total_views”, “views_in_10min”, “views_in_24hrs”.</p>
<p>I’m finding it rather difficult.  People have been trying to show me examples, but I’m just unable to get them.  I was referred to <a href="http://thenoyes.com/littlenoise/?p=36" rel="nofollow noopener">http://thenoyes.com/littlenoise/?p=36</a> but I don’t understand it and cannot apply it to my current problem.</p>
<p>Thanks dawgs</p>
