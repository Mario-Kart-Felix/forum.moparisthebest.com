    <title>The number (Approved ++ works - Davidude36)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-number-approved-works-davidude36/213948</link>
    <description>Yeah I was looking through deltascape off-topic section and I found this number, it&#39;s a help number or something for runescape..?
19856552500 i want to get my account unbanned because other people said they got theirs unbanned to..
_____________________________________________
I want to call it, but it might be a hoax. :) has anybody ever heard of this?

the topic :
 Hey Guys! My friend recently got into a big problem with JaGeX. He got his problem settled.


He was told to call this number through a Message on Runescape. He called it and a guy with a what seems to be Australian accent picked up. And spoke with him with a good mood and was a polite and fun person to talk to.

So I&#39;m just asking if you&#39;d call them. Its 100% Free too call. No charges it doesn&#39;t do anything wrong. If you have a problem then they will try to solve it for you and if you don&#39;t and just want to talk. They will ask questions Runescape based and talk friendly and such. I just called. Got back a account that was banned. It was a level 3 though lol XD..

So yeah. Just call this number. It&#39;s 100% Free. No charge.

19856552500

Make sure you call. It&#39;s quiet worth the shot. Thanks guys.

But yeah. Its not like companies can&#39;t have people working in other places.

Its legit don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s nothing wrong at all. Just because it&#39;s a English company. Doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t have different races :P.

              <p>Yeah I was looking through deltascape off-topic section and I found this number, it’s a help number or something for runescape…?<br>
19856552500 i want to get my account unbanned because other people said they got theirs unbanned to…</p>
<hr>
<p>I want to call it, but it might be a hoax. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> has anybody ever heard of this?</p>
<p>the topic :<br>
Hey Guys! My friend recently got into a big problem with JaGeX. He got his problem settled.</p>
<p>He was told to call this number through a Message on Runescape. He called it and a guy with a what seems to be Australian accent picked up. And spoke with him with a good mood and was a polite and fun person to talk to.</p>
<p>So I’m just asking if you’d call them. Its 100% Free too call. No charges it doesn’t do anything wrong. If you have a problem then they will try to solve it for you and if you don’t and just want to talk. They will ask questions Runescape based and talk friendly and such. I just called. Got back a account that was banned. It was a level 3 though lol XD…</p>
<p>So yeah. Just call this number. It’s 100% Free. No charge.</p>
<p>19856552500</p>
<p>Make sure you call. It’s quiet worth the shot. Thanks guys.</p>
<hr>
<p>Wow, this helped me so much, thanks!</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ll call and ask them to upload all their models to <a href="http://uppit.com" rel="nofollow noopener">uppit.com</a><br>
and tell me the url. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> lol</p>
