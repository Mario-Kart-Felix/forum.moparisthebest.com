    <title>Custom npc (Armour is loaded, npc itself isn&#39;t)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-npc-armour-is-loaded-npc-itself-isnt/552330</link>
    <description>Hello!

I don&#39;t know if someone knows about this? But i would really love you if you helped me :o
With some help from someone i finally managed to get the npc in my game, i used npc id 1 for it, and i can see the armour, but the npc that belongs in the armour set is invisible?

Also, just wondering, my npc anims are fucked :p The whip animation is very strange and walk animation also, it&#39;s standing is very unrealistic, does it have to do with the fact there&#39;s no npc in the armour? (Maybe a really dumb question) :p
