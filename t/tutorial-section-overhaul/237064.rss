    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tutorial-section-overhaul/237064</link>
    <description>As you may of noticed, the Rs2 tutorial section is down to 5 pages. I spent a few hours going through the section and locking required topics, etc. If you have noticed I may of missed one or two, if this is the case please feel free to push that report button.

I&#39;m posting this asking that you try to keep that section clean.</description>
