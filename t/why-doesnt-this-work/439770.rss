    <description>[code]else if (!newDung() &amp;&amp; inDung == true) {
			getPA().movePlayer(2634, 4691, playerId*500);
		}[/code]
That would mean if the player isn&#39;t in newDung() and inDung == true; the player gets teleported back to the specified coordinates if i&#39;m right... Why doesn&#39;t it work?</description>

<p>He could have already used those for something else. I think you guys are getting way off topic now. It doesn’t matter, it works, is simple and doesn’t have any difference than if he had used another number.</p>

<p>Guys can you please stop posting and asking about the same problem over and over again…</p>
<p>The reason is because every 4 floors the world resets… He just messed up and did 500 instead of 400 or just 4.</p>
<p>That code just makes it so you are teleported to a world that no one else is in.</p>

<p>I am fairly certain the floor id*500 will work just fine. But it is much better just to do the playerId * 5 (every 5 height levels it repeats meaning you can create a floor for each person based on their playerId. The height level client sided will be stored in an integer.</p>

<p>Are you taking the initial ‘floor 0’ into account?</p>

<p>Also with an else if statement, That code will only execute if the original if statement is false.</p>

That would mean if the player isn’t in newDung() and inDung == true; the player gets teleported back to the specified coordinates if i’m right… Why doesn’t it work?</p>
