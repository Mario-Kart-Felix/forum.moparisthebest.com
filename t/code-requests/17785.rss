    <title>Code Requests</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/code-requests/17785</link>
    <description>Okay... Well. I was wondering if someone could help me out...

Firstly, is there any way to get it so that when females put on a top, it doesn&#39;t still look like a guy top. A code for that, or at least for only drag chain, would be very helpful.

Secondly, I was wondering if there is a code or whatever to get rid of the bug where, if someone disconnects during a trade the opposite person will loose the items that they had put up for trade?

Finally, is there a way to make the ::char command avaliable to all users rather than just administrators?

Thanks for the help,
-Alexia</description>

For the char command, go in to client.java and search for “char” untill you come to the command, delete the bit saying like if players 3 or something.</p>
