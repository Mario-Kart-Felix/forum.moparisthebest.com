    <title>Connecting my server to the net(millenium edition)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-my-server-to-the-net-millenium-edition/63939</link>
    <description>Ok so I have millenium edition windows, cant use hamachi. Well at least that i know of. Is there anyway to have it online for others to use besides hamachi, also I was looking for a way to allow my other computer to play on the server as well. I have a linksys router/cable/2 computers. 

I have my source compiled and i access it all the time through moparscape on my computer so i believe i have everything ineed with the exception of a way to get it publicly online.

If anyone knows away, or if i missed a guide somewhere please shoot me a link or respond if you can help.

       Thanks Mul</description>
