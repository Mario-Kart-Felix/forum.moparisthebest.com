    <title>Porting question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/porting-question/465834</link>
    <description>Just a quick question. Trying to help a friend get his server up and he is getting a porting error &quot;no route to host&quot; well that does seem obvious what the error is but I am not sure myself. I have in the router under port forward both udp/tcp 43594 and also in the firewall I have made exceptions for 43594 tcp/udp inbound rules.</description>
