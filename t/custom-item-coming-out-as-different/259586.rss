    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-item-coming-out-as-different/259586</link>
    <description>Hello I am having trouble with a custom item I made. I followed this tutorial &quot;[b]How to make/add your own Custom Items(Updated, 9 Steps,NEW DOWNLOAD LINKS) [TuT][/b]&quot; by varmisher several times through and made my own custom weapon. When I go and add it into my server files though it comes out as different items depending on the id I make it. Is their an Id i can make it wear it will come out as the weapon I made it to be?? if it is not the id...what would be the problem. All help is appreciated.</description>
