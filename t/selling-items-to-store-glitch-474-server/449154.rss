    <title>Selling items to store glitch. (474 server)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/selling-items-to-store-glitch-474-server/449154</link>
    <description>In my server if you purchase multiple of any item from any shop you can sell it back as 10. Let me give an example to help anyone that doesn&#39;t understand.

1.You Purchase 10 Dragon Longswords
2.You right click 1 Dragon Longsword and choose the option Sell 10 or Sell 100.
3.1 of the dragon longsword will sell to the general store and leave your inventory but you will receive the money for 10.

Things to note: The sell 1 option works perfectly fine. Giving you the money for 1 and taking 1 from your inventory.
Any suggestions?

UPDATE:
The root of the problem is the Sell 10 and Sell 100 option. How can I get these to work correctly?</description>
