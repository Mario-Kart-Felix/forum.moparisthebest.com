    <description>Hi, I downloaded the source, client, and cache for the source torvapkz a while ago and had it working and coded a few things into it such as custom shops and such. Its been a few months since ive used it and tryed to run the client.bat and found that the cmd box appeared saying &quot;The system cannot find the path specified. Press any key to continue...&quot; Ive tried downloading other multiple clients and the same happened. Ive put my current jdk into it and everything. Can someone please help, thanks. Also if needed we could teamview the problem. -nuck</description>

is what it says for the run (windows 7) client. My jdk is 1.7.0. There is a few runs for the client such as run, 64-bit run, and runwind7. Runwind7 is the only run that keeps a steady cmd box up. The others flash a cmd box then close itself before i can read what it says. not sure how to take screenshots or snippets sorry.</p>
