    <description>[b][u]Project Revert[/u][/b]

We are a fairly new server out there we currently host on a VPS so we are 24/7 and we usually have about 10+ players on at all times.

We can code a little ourselves E.g. we fixed all god sword problems today stances and such, but we need someone with real experience who can meet our demands when coding E.G. we need 100% barrage as ours is partly glitched and we could do with other things like that doing so... if you would like to code for us you will be rewarded every now and then and probably receive staff position so please FILL out the application below and paste to a post or contact me by PM or msn - Pikey123@msn.com

Thanks my pker
