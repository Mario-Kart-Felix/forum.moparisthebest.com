    <description>Ok, well I guess I wasn&#39;t suppose to use my email so sorry about that.  And its not an ad clicking thing, I&#39;ve researched all of those sites and even though most of them pay out, they are dumb because you can only view like 10 ads a day for sometimes even less then 1 cent!  

Just thought it would be a fun idea to try and I know there are skilled enought ppl here to pull it off.
