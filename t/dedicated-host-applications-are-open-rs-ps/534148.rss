    <description>[center][i][b][u]Hello fellow Moparians[/u][/b][/i]
[/center]My name is Sean AKA Twins, I am from Israel (The Holy Land  :) ), I am 25 years old. I am currently in my military service here in Israel. I lived in America for 10 years,  in that 10 years I studied the follow things:

I am starting a development team which I want to be part of and not in charge of. I will do actions that involve of &quot;being in charge&quot; because I will have to, but I want to feel like all my other team mates in the manner of doing actions to get to the highest potential of a RS Project that can be.

I am really looking for having fun working together,  I also want people that do not have any idea in Java or what ever to join, so they can learn from me and others.

<p>Howdy Reminance,</p>
<p>in order to keep the game safe etc we need to have it published.<br>
So I will save your name and when the game will go to beta stages will give you a heads up <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
