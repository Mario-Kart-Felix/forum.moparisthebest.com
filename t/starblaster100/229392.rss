    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starblaster100/229392</link>
    <description>Hello, Mopar Community Members.
I felt that I should inform you that StarBlaster100 has been de-adminned on SRL-Forums. 
According to our Admin Panel information. He did the following:

He made a shadow account, which he gave access masks to view [b]ALL[/b] forums and sub-forums on SRL. (Admin Forums, Developers Forums, et cetera) 
With this shadow account, named [b]Daniel.Blaze[/b], he tried to split up the SRL-Community and flame on SRL-staff members.

You can find the public thread that WT-Fakawi made, here:
http://www.srl-forums.com/forum/starblaster100-no-longer-t37613.html
And everyone who is an SRL-Member can find the thread were Starblaster (Daniel.Blaze) flamed, here: 
http://www.srl-forums.com/forum/would-you-do-t37476.html

Some of this seems to be done a [b]LONG[/b] time ago. We never noticed it before.
Some logs and IP&#39;s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;37976  	Starblaster100  	12:29, 3rd Sep 2007  	accessmask.php  	modify  	   	80.254.147.52&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am pretty confident this is Starblaster and I am very confident Boreas has nothing to do with this. Boreas once lent his account to StarBlaster100 so he could do some admin stuff which he on his own account could not.

Daniel.Blaze account info:
Referrer: &quot;StarBlaster100&quot;.
Email: Daniel.Blaze.[B]100[/B]@googlemail.com

The &#39;Current users viewing this thread&#39; feature also disappeared some time ago, too. Maybe because Daniel.Blaze could not be made invisible? That would certainly draw too much attention.

&lt;blockquote&gt;37976          Starblaster100          12:29, 3rd Sep 2007     accessmask.php          modify                  [B]80.254.147.52[/B]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is the only time StarBlaster100 ever entered accessmasks.php.

The non existing Daniel.Blaze did NOT hack StarBlaster100. This really is StarBlaster&#39;s own doing.

Also, please note... If you feel that we made a mistake, please don&#39;t hesitate to defend StarBlaster and post here.
It all seemed very unlikely at the start, but there now is so much evidence the SRL-Staff team could only draw one conclusion from the evidence: This really is StarBlaster100&#39;s doing, and his intention was to damage SRL&#39;s morale.

Five (totally different) IP Matches, the Access masks were set on one of those give IP&#39;s, and the way Daniel.Blaze behaved is very much like Starblaster100&#39;s behavior when he was upset. It all sums up. We also heard that he recently was very upset because Hobbit became an admin. And Daniel.Blaze heavily flamed Hobbit in some threads. 

Thank you for your time.</description>

Offtopic (as if everything in threads is actually on topic) I disagree Pwnd. One of my childhood friends, he’s 27 now, was heavily into drugs. When he was 22 him and some of his buddies bought a vial of acid. They dipped cookies into the vial without measuring the amount they put in and he had a bad trip on a lot of acid. He became a paranoid schizophrenic and was in jail and a mental institution since.</p>
<p>And they also did a test on an elephant by giving it about 1000 tabs of acid (or maybe it was 10 milligrams, I forget) and it died… sooooooooooo lol idk i think anything that you take too much of, can kill you.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yea but thats not overdosing…[/quote]<br>
If I see any bad repercussions from anything, I would call it an overdose of that something because I believe if I did that something less, the outcome would have been different. But those are only the bad times such as the example I mentioned with my neighbor.</p>

<p>Because being a staff member under his control was a horrible experience. He was somebody who only wished for power and cared little about community progression. He was one of the only individuals who was capable of wiping someone completely from the scene.</p>
<p>@ People who claim i’m in it for the power - I was. I haven’t asked for promotions of any sort for a long while. I have looked after the community behind thick walls and will continue to do so until it dies.</p>

<p>I really did weird things to my brain by dropping lots of acid. I see trails all the time and I often have several full blown flashbacks a day. Yet, acid has helped me get in touch with myself and think more clearly, and for that I am thankful. On the other hand, I would recommend caution in dosing, and don’t mix acid with shrooms unless you know what’s down with what’s up.</p>
