    <title>Some simple edits to a few files if you have a few minutes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-simple-edits-to-a-few-files-if-you-have-a-few-minutes/462480</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t edit shit as my photoshop decided now was a great time to stop working + I have no skills in this.

Basically I&#39;m using RCS, however my website isn&#39;t really related to rsps or RS much at all besides a couple sections on the forums.

I need it re-written so it says &quot;Create new account (new user)&quot;

I need the &quot;Play Runescape&quot; replaced with &quot;Login&quot; and keep the &quot;(existing user)&quot;

And this I want the Sword and stones taken out and replaced by  &quot;JavaTC.com&quot; however keep the characters if possible and keep the background transparent.  It can be in the same satyle as the login buttons&#39; text if you want

It would also be nice if they were kept in the same file format as before

If you could do this just to help me out then that would be great considering I lack any at all knowledge of editing images.</description>
