Yes, but you should remember that at this current moment, Android 2.3 only holds approximately 1% of the market share and several manufacturers are really bad with pushing updates to their customers.[/quote]<br>
I meant to respond the other day but forgot.  That article says that the fix was backported to older androids and pushed by many manufacturers as well, so just because you don’t have 2.3 doesn’t mean you don’t have the fix.</p>

<p>I have to admit that the reaction time for removing it from the market was impressive, however the real problem is the fact that google didn’t notice it when approving them. It’s ashame that most manufacturers don’t just give the user root access by default with a proper password that the user must choose. Something like this would never happen…</p>

              <p>BUT they also all got pulled from the market and all phones with 5 minutes of notice that they were malicious.  That’s a great reaction time for anything, Microsoft would have taken weeks to do the same.</p>
<p>Also, if you run DroidWall or similar on your phone none of these ‘exploits’ could have reached the network anyway.</p>
