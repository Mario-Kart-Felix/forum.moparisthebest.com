It was a question, I’m just wondering. People work for their items in the game, and people work for their ‘items’ in real life. Some people put a lot of time and effort into this stuff, and you take it away without a backwards glance.<br>

The way I view the game, realistic is everything being the same as SSP, except other players are doing it with you. In other words, you get killed by drowning, mobs, fire, falling etc, and nothing is going to take your items away when you die (except fire/lava of course). I view it as survival, we’re all in it together with the same rules as single player, trying to <span class="bbcode-i">survive</span> against the mobs, not each other.</p>
<p>I don’t want the rules of the game to change just because I’m playing with other people as well.<br>
[/quote]Then we should naturally learn that ourselves, rather than being forced by some annoying server mod.</p>
<p>People get excited about any sort of change anyway. I remember when mitb posted about enabling PvP and having raids etc, and everyone was really enthusiastic. We’ll get this residence mod, everyone will rave about how awesome it is, and then soon people will be crying they want vanilla back after all.[/quote]Actually not everyone was excited, more than half didn’t want to do it unless we had some extra mods to control it.</p>

<p>But yea, I do view you guys as the bad guys. You’re just as bad (probably worse, as you have intelligence and can take our items :P) than the mobs already in the game.<br>
[/quote]<br>
If we survived together, then we would all live in a happy little dome of obsidian with no need to worry about mobs. I like the idea of everyone establishing different kingdoms, and power being in different hands. If you remember back to the old server, you would know that there was a period of time where the akatsuki (tabby, krack, cole, agl, vain and I) pretty much had all of the power, as we dominated on resources, city size, and the mass amount of raids we did, primarily based on the city of Haven.<br>
After awhile in the game, once you have a fort, house, etc, there is no need to worry about mobs. I like the idea of worrying about players stealing my stuff. Do I get mad when they do? Sure, who wouldn’t! But then the enjoyment of setting up traps when they come back becomes fun, it adds a whole new level to the game.<br>
David, even you yourself said it to a guy a few weeks ago that he’s looking for a freebuild server. Honestly, it sounds like you’re slowing pushing the server toward freebuild every chance you get.[/quote]I’m not saying everyone should live together, I’m just saying we shouldn’t be set out against each other.<br>
The only thing I see interesting about anything you guys do is building traps, but by all means you could still do that if PvP wasn’t enabled. As for having nothing to do, the point of the game is to build, so once you have set yourself up, why not do it!</p>
<p>As for a creative/freebuild server, that’s a bit different. In those you usually have unlimited blocks and you don’t need to worry about mobs or anything.</p>

<p>I’m saying that the game should be more realistic and as close to vanilla as possible. Being physically stopped from hitting someone or destroying even a single block placed in their city takes a lot of fun out of the game. I like things to have a purpose and be functional. For example, it’d be much more exciting if people made bank vaults opened by lever combinations. Perhaps we could make just a certain block (like obsidian) indestructible to people who don’t live in your city, which could be used for things like this? Much better than typing commands to unlock your chests (which seems hackish and unrealistic).</p>

              <p>I too put a lot of time and effort into minecraft, mostly in making security and defence systems to protect the people in our city and our possessions. If you’re happy to spend the day mining diamonds but don’t bother to hide your chests properly, then that makes you a very naive person. The same goes for blissfully walking around with all your possessions in your inventory.</p>
<p>Even in real life you don’t expose your possessions to the world unless you’re sure they’re well protected or insured. You have locks on doors, alarm systems, a violent police force, etc etc.</p>
