    <title>Anyone need a coder?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-need-a-coder/318770</link>
    <description>Hello, i am looking for a server to code. I can code just about anything but only on 317. I have limits on 508+. If i code your server i will only be looking for about 45%+ of donation money. I have worked with top coders before. It doesnt matter if your server is mega popular or not.. i will be more than happy to code any server even if its got 5 players or 500 players. [b]Thankyou.[/b]</description>
