    <description>Hi, may you please take your time to try and solve my problems... I&#39;m starting to get p-oed about them!

1. I have edited and went through 2 times on editing the NPC talk in NPCHandler.java and after that i save, compile and have even restarted the Runserver.bat thing, when i go on the server it still says the Dialogue it has had before but i go into NPCHandler.java and everything is the same as it was, so I am confused! PLZ HELP

2. I have edited the starting outfit in Player.java, when I save compile, etc... i start a new acc, when i go on there is the original outfit, like i said things arent being transfered, its pissin&#39; me off! But plz help   

Thanks for taking your time for reading this! That&#39;s it for now, and ANY info would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again,
Axlnosbest1  :)</description>
