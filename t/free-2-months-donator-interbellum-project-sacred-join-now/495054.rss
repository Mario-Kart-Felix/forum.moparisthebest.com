Old update logs:
[code]Done some updates.
Added pets for donators-only in the donator shop(donator island), only thing you can do is drop, pick it up and let it follow you. I will improve this with it&#39;s real abilities(growing etc) as how it is on Runescape, didn&#39;t look it up yet.
Improved combat, loads all item definitions used in combat such as if it is a bow, dart, crystal, bolts and arrows on startup. Less load on server = faster.
Improved special hits of some weapons which needed some powering up, especially for claws, korasi&#39;s and the armadyl godsword.
Redone the switching method, all item configurations are now loaded upon startup so the switching could perform faster.
Combat checked the hit after the delay so you could manipulate the hit by changing your armour which would result in hits above 500, this was only the case at special attacks.
Redone the maximum hit calculating method, armour worn when the attack is performed counts at the playerbonus now.
Switching configurations loaded on startup, must be smoother now.
Fixed some glitches related to letting players click the object while teleing, was abused by some people.
Fixed a bug at npcs where it wouldn&#39;t follow if the player was beneath the npc and the size of the npc was 1.
Fixed a clipping glitch caused by npcs it would check in the wrong direction thinking that their was an object between the player and the npc.
Fixed a bug in the combat related to the ammo-checker, if it had no arrows it would say something like &#39;you cannot use &#39;unarmed&#39; with .... bow&#39; where it should say you have no arrows :]
Fixed a bug in the combat related to ranging, it wouldn&#39;t check the weaponry in the right way thinking the range weapon was for melee.
Trading in wilderness is possible now.
Useless sent byte within the player updating, fixed.
Moved town crier the skill reseter for donators and moved a donator npc who was lost in the desert.
Added 10 revenants to level 35 wilderness drop rates vary based on their combat levels, forinthry bracelet effect also works. &#39;Players can use a charge of the bracelet to become immune to damage caused by Revenants for one minute, as well remove their aggression for one hour. &#39; Forinthry bracelets can be bought at the pk shop for 10 pk points.
Redone the drop tables of Corporeal Beast, Kree Arra, Ice Strykewyrms and some other bosses.
Redone the whole shops system, it was poorly coded and had some bugs.
Increased drop rate of pvp armour at the revenants, added ability to heal themselves for revenants, fixed the non-stop freezing ability.
Fixed a couple of gates.
Changed pk spot &#39;Lava Crossing&#39; to Chaos altar and replaced the donator guy to donator island.
Void would sometimes bug due to a glitch, fixed it.
Turmoil effect now also works on npcs, redone the whole curses system.
Added really basic farming since people were complaing about no farming, if I have time I will improve this. (Three patches are working at the moment, only introducing one at the moment which is the herb patch at catherby)
Familiars wouldn&#39;t dissapear after dying due to a null glitch, fixed this.
Familiars sometimes could hit a player who was standing in non-multi, fixed this.
You could sell pets to the shop and then a non-donator could retrieve it.
Lowered shards price to 500k and increased the price for the jars obtained at hunter with a quite large amount.
Updates:
Added combat skills difficulty, pure at easiest and some special rewards for the legendary one(Better drop ratio and legends cape)
Added a special teleport interface with all the needed teleports.
Added perfect lootshare just as Runescape, with working lootshare potential.
Added lottery, you can enter up to 3 times. 1M per entry at 210M it will choose a winner and reset the pot. Saves upon logout and server restart. Just perfect.
Modern teleports now work, they teleport to city places.
All shops redone, also a separate place for the shops now(shops are more pk-based).
More accurate hit system implemented, zamorakian spear and vesta spear effects at the Corporeal beast also work now.
Reworked the combat weapon delay system and hit intervals.
Donator zone fully redone, much better now with many bosses and abilities.
New voting system which supports multiple items.
Quest tab made so it looks better, some of the options are also clickable now so which supports forced chat of the shown text.
Recipe for disaster fully redone with all the sizes and gfx and animations.
Almost done with nex, just needs some finishing touches. It will get released when it is perfect.
All prices have been redone, so the economy will start out well.
Fixed rocktails, they are notable now.
Double-click shop closing bug fixed.
All npc drops redone
And much much more things which I don&#39;t remember, just look @ them ingame.
Zamorakian spear speed and animations have been added, also the boost has been increased.
Ava&#39;s accumulator now also saves knives.
The color of the lootshare message is correct now.
You couldn&#39;t mine tin ores, which has been fixed now.
Npc aggresiveness more accurate now, it would sometimes bug.
The voting reward rocktail was glitched, it would reward it noted.
Fixed a big bug, which caused the server to slow performance over time.
Added equipment check to combat difficulty switching and updates combat level immediatly now.
Fixed a clanchat glitch where the client would think more of 1 person was in the clanchat(3 lines with the same name).
Buying items which weren&#39;t stackable and over a certain amount would sometimes glitch and not show up(a relog would fix it), but instead of cheap fixing it I&#39;ve redone the whole method so you won&#39;t see this happening anymore.[/code]
