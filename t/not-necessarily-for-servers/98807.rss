    <description>Well, this thread isn&#39;t necessarily for help on an error with a server, it&#39;s with Hamachi..

First:
After I tried uninstalling Hamachi, (newest version), I got an error that I didn&#39;t have the uninstallation log, so it didn&#39;t work.

Second:
After I exited Hamachi a few days ago, I got on a couple days later, tried to put it up, and it said &quot;Failed to load Hamachi Configuration, this application will now close&quot;

I tried doing this:
Start Menu-&gt;Run-&gt;%APPDATA% and renaming the file like I was told to by a friend, I try, and it still doesn&#39;t work, can anyone tell me how to fix this error?</description>

              <p>Removing it won’t work, because it says “File cannot be removed, cannot find uninstallation log.”</p>
<p>EDIT:Guys, I may just make a new PC account, and re-dl it on that, unless someone can post on how to fix it.</p>
