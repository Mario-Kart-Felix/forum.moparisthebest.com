    <description>Hey guys, I am adding different attack animations for NPC&#39;s at different points in the fight but it isn&#39;t working. I have this in my NPCHandler

[code]npcs[i].forceAnim(2259);//[/code]

And I have the forceAnim void in NPC.java

[code]	public void forceAnim(int number) {
		animNumber = number;
		animUpdateRequired = true;
		updateRequired = true;
	}[/code]

But in NPCHandler it says that it cannot find the forceAnim void in NPC.java or that it is set up wrong. I don&#39;t think I set it up wrong but maybe I did. What can I do to fix this? I have all of the necessary things in NPC to make the forceAnim void work.</description>
