    <title>[PI] NPCs With Melee Attack</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npcs-with-melee-attack/518085</link>
    <description>I currently have found out that my NPCs that are called for melee attacks, will hit 0s every single hit even if we change everything around in NPCHandler. You will have 1 def and, lets say bork, bork will hit 0s constantly. Can anyone help?</description>
