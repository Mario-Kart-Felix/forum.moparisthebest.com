    <title>I don&#39;t really know how to name this, but I need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-dont-really-know-how-to-name-this-but-i-need-help/413757</link>
    <description>Okay so like when you hover your mouse of a skill you know how it shows how much expierience you got till next level and so on? Well the lower you get on the skills(for example summoning which is at the bottom) the more to the right that little box 
higlighted in red goes. [IMG]http://i53.tinypic.com/2h52wbs.png[/img]
How can I make it so it doesn&#39;t do that? Also so it shows the highlighted thing you have to click the skill first, how would I change this? Thank You!</description>
