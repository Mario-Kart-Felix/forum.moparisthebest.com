    <title>Any suggested 317 RSPS Starter sources?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-suggested-317-rsps-starter-sources/430554</link>
    <description>ive been looking for a couple days at server from all over ifferent websites. i found a blank server that i wanted to start from scratch with and then i noticed it had no dds specials or ancient magics or anything like that and i was dissapointed. so i downloaded allstarscape and similar source from other people who used there sources and he has it where admins or owners cant even spawn items(REALLY DUMB IF YOU ASK ME). but it had a dds spec and working ancients and all that stuff. butbecause i could spawn items its was useless i tryed changing the command in the client.java file and it didnt work just told me i had an error.

i seriously want to code a server myself and put bosses and skilling spots i dont mind startin from point blank. i need one that has been cleaned or is blank that atleast has weapon specials and can use ancients. does anyone know of any?


i dont care if it is a [PI] or a Regular source.</description>

              <p>Generally, PI and Delta are the starter sources. I would go with PI though if you want to learn more as Delta is quite out dated and PIs are a lot more flexible.</p>
