    <title>Should i switch?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-i-switch/332990</link>
    <description>ok one of my desktop,

which i use it for email,printing, youtube , just playing internet stuff and burning...
nothing else.

i currently have xp on it, (its a 4 year old comp)..i was thinking if i should install ubuntu on it.

my folks sometime use it, just to check their e-mail..so i though it&#39;d be better to have unbuntu..

just in case if there some viral problems..

so is it a wise choice?

is there anything i will be missing out, or gaining due to the switch..(i don&#39;t want to be dual boot,)</description>

only reason you might not want to switch is mainstream PC-designed games (go around surfing topics on 1337 games and notice how everyone’s going on about “WoW not working,” etc, etc.)</p>
<p>forgot to mention, if you want a nice little kick in speed, use Xfce (seeing as your comp is 4 years old…)</p>
