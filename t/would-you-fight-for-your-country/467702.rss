    <title>Would you fight for your country?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-you-fight-for-your-country/467702</link>
    <description>I have noticed that there is a division of people who have different militia beliefs as far as reasons to fight, respect for those who go into reserves/combatant positions, and etc.

So now I have three questions that I would like to see a good and MATURE debate about.

1) Would you fight for your country? And Why?

2) What would motivate you to join/fight for your country?

3) Is there any standing order you would refuse to do (i.e. kill on sight etc ) no matter of the punishment?</description>

              <p>[quote=“Loveandpower, post:6, topic:467702”]1) I would be glad to do some behind the scenes type of stuff but I would never and I  mean NEVER kill others. Nor would I invade another country, obviously I suppose it would depend on the situation solely.<br>
2) Would depend on your situation/on personal events that surround you. It’s sort of like the “what would you do if your brother” question<br>
3) Murder, no matter what. It isn’t a religous thing I just don’t it fair to take the life of another no matter of what.[/quote]<br>
i agree 1000%</p>

well </p><blockquote>propaganda spread by the wealthy or greedy in the usa.</blockquote> caused the Usa to hate and corrupt what communism is about. I only think it would be justified, and Fidel couldn’t succeed not to undermine him, but it’s just general history and studying U.S history that makes me believe he would never succeed without a lot of help. Well, I mean back then because my country is getting weak from a corrupt system, I am leaving soon because I believe it’s an endless war here that will lead to the U.S become United States of China or Soviet Russia xD, our economy is shit, everything is expensive, it’s like $4 a gallon, $7.25 for a pack of newports, unjustified court sentencing, corrupt gov’t, and not to mention Barrack Osama.

              <ol>
<li>
<p>Would you fight for your country? And Why?<br>
A: Yes, as a U.S citizen we are hated around the world and since we have a lot of land people will want to endanger my/our families lives, I will fight for my country and the people. Yes, I think violence is wrong, but it’s necessary when it means your life. “It’s survival of the fittest”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What would motivate you to join/fight for your country?<br>
A: above I explained why and just to keep citizens safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any standing order you would refuse to do (i.e. kill on sight etc ) no matter of the punishment?<br>
No there is no unreasonable killing generally in our military. You try to kill me, I’m going to kill you, easy as that. I’d rather have it be you than me.</p>

<p>The gassing of kurds was not the reason presented for the invasion. And making the country a shit-hole for something he did in late 80s doesn’t make any sense. Try again to justify the killing of Saddam Hussein and destroying Iraq.</p>
