    <title>Korasi sword problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/korasi-sword-problem/422091</link>
    <description>ok so I have a 317 client and source and I was trying to add korasi to it and I thought I did everything right but I guess I didnt 

My client is setup like this

Client
Cache Class Raw Sign Sprites then all the files
Cache&gt; Data Sprites and models.dat and models2.dat

the rest should matter

also my customs are located in item.def

so anyways the file had me extract the models to my model folder which i didnt see so I read some where to add it to raw so I did that and then went in to itemDef.java and convertedthe clas8 to itemDef and then posted everything in there heres how it looked after conversion

                case 15350:
                        itemDef.actions = new String[5];
                        itemDef.actions[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
                        itemDef.femaleEquip1 = 35085;
                        itemDef.modelOffset1 = 25;
                        itemDef.modelOffset2 = 60;
                        itemDef.modelZoom = 1400;
                        itemDef.modelRotation1 = 700;
                        itemDef.modelRotation2 = 60;
                        itemDef.maleEquip1 = 35085;
                        itemDef.modelID = 57784;
                        itemDef.name = &quot;Korasi&#39;s Sword&quot;;
                        itemDef.aByte205 = -10;
                        itemDef.aByte154 = -10;
                        itemDef.anInt188 = -1;//female sleeve
                        itemDef.anInt164 = -1;//male sleeve
                        itemDef.description = &quot;The sword of a Void Knight.&quot;.getBytes();       
                break;
