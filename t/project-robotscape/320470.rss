    <description>I have had this server for a while. I had recently quit private servers but before i do i was thinking of releasing this.


I am posting on the server developement section BEACUSE I WOULD LIKE SOME IDEAS FROM YOU GUYS ONE WHAT I COULD PUT IN OR CHANGE BEFORE I THINK OF RELEASING.

Thank you.

Features-

-Perfect deathstages for every minigame
-Genie lamp (grants xp in skills)
-myster box which gives a random item
-pk points (server automatically adds the items to you invo once you gain the required points)
-Two different types on bolts both made from herblore and fletching and require 99 fletching and herblore.
 (They require special items to make which can be found from monster drops)
-Shops at home they are realistic

Interfaces

-Clan chat
-Item loss on death
-Equipment stats
-Price checker

In-game features

-Safe wild
-Castle wars (With reward shop)
-High and low training
-Assualt
-Barrows (Must dig and kill to enter tunnels)
-God wars
-63 wave jad (challenging)
-Giant mole (which drops items which are required for some skills)
-kbd ( kbd is in level 147 wildy)
-Mith drags are hd and are in a safe spot
-Fully working abbys

-There is good stability and the server in my opinion is quite tidy and simple.


And the rest of the other minigames which are normally featured.

I tried to make it so every item is worth atleast something. This is because when you have a pure and you pk the items you pk are usally not worth alot. So the ghostly robes, barrows gloves etc have been added to the Assualt shop.

(TRIED TO MAKE THE ECONOMY BETTER)


A few commands

Staff

-Banuser
-Ipbanuser
-Jail
-Unjail
-Mute
-Unmute

Players

-Players
-Remove donor (removes donor crown)
-Resetatk (Re-sets attack iff under i think 10k-20k xp iff you accidently get glitched)
-Resetstr
-Resetdef
-Resetslayertask (resets your slayer task)
-Pkpoints

And all of the clan chat commands

-ccmake and so on


Skillcape emotes work (I have tried to make them to the best of my ability)

There are a few customs in the server but not so many that it ruins the economy and look of the server.


All monster drops are realistic and are not easy to get.
Xp is quite fast and skilling can be challenging but fun at the same time.


Fixed alot of glitches which were causing problems and have fixed them 100%.

I cannot say i have fixed 100% of glitches but i can say im very very close.

If there is a glitch it would be a very very small one and wouldnt be to do with combat etc.

Weapons

Some very rare weapons are powerful but weapons are not too over powered that they ruin the game

THE TWO RARE BOLTS WHICH YOU HAVE TO MAKE HIT HIGH WITH RANGE. I INCREASED THE POWER OF SOME SPELLS. I DID THIS BECAUSE I WANTED TO TRY AND BALANCE THE 3 OF THEM SO IT GIVES EVERYONE A CHANCE.


Thank you for reading please suggest.


Pictures comming soon.</description>
