        <p>I have had this server for a while. I had recently quit private servers but before i do i was thinking of releasing this.</p>
<p>I am posting on the server developement section BEACUSE I WOULD LIKE SOME IDEAS FROM YOU GUYS ONE WHAT I COULD PUT IN OR CHANGE BEFORE I THINK OF RELEASING.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Features-</p>
<p>-Perfect deathstages for every minigame<br>
-Genie lamp (grants xp in skills)<br>
-myster box which gives a random item<br>
-pk points (server automatically adds the items to you invo once you gain the required points)<br>
-Two different types on bolts both made from herblore and fletching and require 99 fletching and herblore.<br>
(They require special items to make which can be found from monster drops)<br>
-Shops at home they are realistic</p>
<p>Interfaces</p>
<p>-Clan chat<br>
-Item loss on death<br>
-Equipment stats<br>
-Price checker</p>
<p>In-game features</p>
<p>-Safe wild<br>
-Castle wars (With reward shop)<br>
-High and low training<br>
-Assualt<br>
-Barrows (Must dig and kill to enter tunnels)<br>
-God wars<br>
-63 wave jad (challenging)<br>
-Giant mole (which drops items which are required for some skills)<br>
-kbd ( kbd is in level 147 wildy)<br>
-Mith drags are hd and are in a safe spot<br>
-Fully working abbys</p>
<p>-There is good stability and the server in my opinion is quite tidy and simple.</p>
<p>And the rest of the other minigames which are normally featured.</p>
<p>I tried to make it so every item is worth atleast something. This is because when you have a pure and you pk the items you pk are usally not worth alot. So the ghostly robes, barrows gloves etc have been added to the Assualt shop.</p>
<p>(TRIED TO MAKE THE ECONOMY BETTER)</p>
<p>A few commands</p>
<p>Staff</p>
<p>-Banuser<br>
-Ipbanuser<br>
-Jail<br>
-Unjail<br>
-Mute<br>
-Unmute</p>
<p>Players</p>
<p>-Players<br>
-Remove donor (removes donor crown)<br>
-Resetatk (Re-sets attack iff under i think 10k-20k xp iff you accidently get glitched)<br>
-Resetstr<br>
-Resetdef<br>
-Resetslayertask (resets your slayer task)<br>
-Pkpoints</p>
<p>And all of the clan chat commands</p>
<p>-ccmake and so on</p>
<p>Skillcape emotes work (I have tried to make them to the best of my ability)</p>
<p>There are a few customs in the server but not so many that it ruins the economy and look of the server.</p>
<p>All monster drops are realistic and are not easy to get.<br>
Xp is quite fast and skilling can be challenging but fun at the same time.</p>
<p>Fixed alot of glitches which were causing problems and have fixed them 100%.</p>
<p>I cannot say i have fixed 100% of glitches but i can say im very very close.</p>
<p>If there is a glitch it would be a very very small one and wouldnt be to do with combat etc.</p>
<p>Weapons</p>
<p>Some very rare weapons are powerful but weapons are not too over powered that they ruin the game</p>
<p>THE TWO RARE BOLTS WHICH YOU HAVE TO MAKE HIT HIGH WITH RANGE. I INCREASED THE POWER OF SOME SPELLS. I DID THIS BECAUSE I WANTED TO TRY AND BALANCE THE 3 OF THEM SO IT GIVES EVERYONE A CHANCE.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading please suggest.</p>
<p>Pictures comming soon.</p>
