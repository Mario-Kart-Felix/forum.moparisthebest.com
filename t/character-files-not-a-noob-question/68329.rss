<p>I don’t want to host the whole thing from the website. Just the character files. I know it is possible because you can make a client, for example, call it’s background from the web, so why not be able to do the same with character files?<br>
Kind of… I’ve sen it just recently, <a href="http://RS3.Servergame.Com" rel="nofollow noopener">RS3.Servergame.Com</a> has more then 1 world and the character files instantly transfer from 1 “World” To another… Also PkIsle is ran through a website… Please help…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>well if its ran through a website, it means the site is acting as a server, so i suppose mre than one world is possible.</p>
<p>if i were you id look into hosting sevrers from websites, then see if you can do the same, as far as i know, you could host it from a website, but would be complicated[/quote]</p>
