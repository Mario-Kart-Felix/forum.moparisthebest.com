    <description>*Hint hint all right...Thanks to Jmood for repping me on this tut, I know have, &quot;69!!!!!!!&quot; rep:)
Alright, in most places I&#39;ve seen people make things like this.
BUT it was it explained very good, or people have problems and such.
For such a long time I have had problems doing this, people tired to help.
So I&#39;m here today to FULLY explain in great detail everything about it:)

Most of you have this at the top of your autospawn.cfg;
[code]//------NpcID---CoordX--CoordY--Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption[/code]

First thing I&#39;m going to do is explain that, than show you a explame.

[code]------NpcID[/code]
This part is farily simple, this is just the ID of the npc you would like to place.

[code]---CoordX[/code]
This is just the x coord of your npc that you want to place.

[code]--CoordY[/code]
This is just the y coord of your npc that you want to place.


[code]--Height[/code]
Ofc every knows this. . .
This is just the height you want the npc:)
For example, what floor you want it at, 1 would be on 2nd floor.
2 would be on the 3rd floor and so on.
Same with ground expect it would be -

[code]-WalkType[/code]
The walk-type is VERY important.
I had problems with this.
0 is for if your npc is not moving.
1 is for non attack-able npcs.
2 is for npcs that are able to attack.
(This is true, I have just tested this statement.)

[code]-Description[/code]
This usually is just like this, &quot;Fire Giant.&quot;
You don&#39;t really need anything here unless you would like to.
It doesn&#39;t need the // or anything just tab after walk-type than put the description.

[code]--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2[/code]
This part can be VERY confusing as it was for me and, &quot;Jmood128:P&quot;

The first 2, x1, and y1;
You would take the coords of the npc you spawned.(The coords from where you have placed it.)
And you will add ONTO the coords like so.
2500 2500 is your starting point of the npc, the first part would look like this.
2501 2501

The 2nd part, x2, and y2;
You would take the coords of the npc you spawned.
And you will TAKE away from the coords like so.
2500 2500 is your starting point of the npc still as first one.
2499 2499

So at the end of this it would like this.
[code]spawn = 100	2500	2500	0	2501	2501	2499	2499	1	Test npc[/code]

Every time you add another number to both ends of adding and taking off the current npcs spawned point.
It will add another block to each corner than connecting all the sides.

[URL=http://img291.imageshack.us/i/npcpicture.png/][IMG]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/9608/npcpicture.th.png[/img][/URL]

This will make the monster move within 4 block square.
I hope this has helped anyone that has trouble with this like me and Jmood128 did:)</description>

              <p>*Hint hint all right…Thanks to Jmood for repping me on this tut, I know have, “69!!!” rep:)<br>
Alright, in most places I’ve seen people make things like this.<br>
BUT it was it explained very good, or people have problems and such.<br>
For such a long time I have had problems doing this, people tired to help.<br>
So I’m here today to FULLY explain in great detail everything about it:)</p>
<p>Most of you have this at the top of your autospawn.cfg;</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//------NpcID---CoordX--CoordY--Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption</code></pre>
<p>First thing I’m going to do is explain that, than show you a explame.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">------NpcID</code></pre>
<p>This part is farily simple, this is just the ID of the npc you would like to place.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">---CoordX</code></pre>
<p>This is just the x coord of your npc that you want to place.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">--CoordY</code></pre>
<p>This is just the y coord of your npc that you want to place.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">--Height</code></pre>
<p>Ofc every knows this. . .<br>
This is just the height you want the npc:)<br>
For example, what floor you want it at, 1 would be on 2nd floor.<br>
2 would be on the 3rd floor and so on.<br>
Same with ground expect it would be -</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-WalkType</code></pre>
<p>The walk-type is VERY important.<br>
I had problems with this.<br>
0 is for if your npc is not moving.<br>
1 is for non attack-able npcs.<br>
2 is for npcs that are able to attack.<br>
(This is true, I have just tested this statement.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-Description</code></pre>
<p>This usually is just like this, “Fire Giant.”<br>
You don’t really need anything here unless you would like to.<br>
It doesn’t need the // or anything just tab after walk-type than put the description.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2</code></pre>
<p>This part can be VERY confusing as it was for me and, “Jmood128:P”</p>
<p>The first 2, x1, and y1;<br>
You would take the coords of the npc you spawned.(The coords from where you have placed it.)<br>
And you will add ONTO the coords like so.<br>
2500 2500 is your starting point of the npc, the first part would look like this.<br>
2501 2501</p>
<p>The 2nd part, x2, and y2;<br>
You would take the coords of the npc you spawned.<br>
And you will TAKE away from the coords like so.<br>
2500 2500 is your starting point of the npc still as first one.<br>
2499 2499</p>
<p>So at the end of this it would like this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 100	2500	2500	0	2501	2501	2499	2499	1	Test npc</code></pre>
<p>Every time you add another number to both ends of adding and taking off the current npcs spawned point.<br>
It will add another block to each corner than connecting all the sides.</p>
<p><a href="http://img291.imageshack.us/i/npcpicture.png/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/9608/npcpicture.th.png" alt width="" height=""></a></p>
<p>This will make the monster move within 4 block square.<br>
I hope this has helped anyone that has trouble with this like me and Jmood128 did:)</p>
