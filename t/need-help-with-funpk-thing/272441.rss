    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-funpk-thing/272441</link>
    <description>Hey I got a question, how can i make it so when people are at funpk arena that the level difference thing that is on my server doesnt apply. I think it would be something like
[code]if coords = 
x=3534w.e the coords are
y=w.e the corods are
and then the void statement = false[/code]
or somehting like that im not that good at coding.
someone help me out with this?</description>
