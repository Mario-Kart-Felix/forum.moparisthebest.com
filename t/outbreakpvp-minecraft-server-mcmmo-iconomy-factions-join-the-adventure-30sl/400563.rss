    <description>---------------------------THE SERVER IS NOW READY!-----------------------------------

----------------------------------EU SERVER!--------------------------------------------

-----------------CHECK OUT http://outbreakpvp.forumotion.co.uk/ ------------------------


We and 6 other friends have been searching for the past few weeks, trying to find the perfect PvP server. Unfortunately, this failed so we&#39;ve decided to start up our own server, this server will be purely dedicated to PvP. We will be adding plugins such as Iconomy, Factions and McMMO - These plugins are the ones that seem to be the building blocks for a good survival/PvP server. 

Iconomy: The reason we are going to be adding this is because it adds rewards after a lot of hard work, for instance, you&#39;ve been mining for an hour and afterwards you can sell your goods to help fund your PvPing
Factions: With PvP comes teams, this also adds for fun to the game, teaming up with your friends to kill other players is a lot more fun in most cases than going in alone in most cases, it also adds power to the clans, building up your clans &gt; more power &gt; MORE PWNAGE!
McMMO: We are adding this because it works well with Iconomy and PvP, working towards increase skill levels which give you more stuff to sell = More money. Not to mention the weapon skill to gank people on the server!
Monsterhunt: For a little hunting fun! (You also get rewards)

Our aims for the server:
- Create a popular hardcore PvP server!
- Create a safe server without hackers and cheaters
- Although it&#39;s PvP and there will be lots of QQing we are going to try and make the server as friendly as possible and enjoyable for all (Even those perfectionists like me who like to run away and build a really nice base that gets griefed after 2 weeks )

Rules:
1. Never ask admins for items!
2. Don&#39;t QQ at admins if you get killed!
3. Be friendly... UNLESS THEY ARE YOUR ENEMIES!!!
4. No hacking / cheating!
5. Griefing is allowed but don&#39;t go over the top xD
6. Chests and doors will be unlocked (Making it for fun to raid) so hide your valuables well!

SERVERS READY NOW! GOOD LUCK ALL!

Future admins:
- Archeon
- AslanSa
- Jake1002

After technical issues we have fixed everything and have re-opened the server! We welcome all of you to come and join the PvP experience! Make your faction and explore the world!</description>
