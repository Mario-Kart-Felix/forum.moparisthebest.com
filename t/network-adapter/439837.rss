    <title>Network Adapter?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/network-adapter/439837</link>
    <description>So I reformatted my computer with Windows XP. And my Netgear router came with software to install and control the router settings. When it attempts to connect it says the network adapter needs to be updated. Keep in mind it also does this when I try to set up a new connection. Its a 2003 dell desktop. Anyway to get an updated driver to it through a USB of some sort?</description>

<p>I had the same issue with my brothers computer, I re-installed Windows (because he got infected… dumb fuck) and his wireless network card wasn’t showing up, same for his Ethernet, so we couldn’t get any access to the internet. It was the drivers, but, they wouldn’t work on windows, I decided to install Linux, and then get the drivers, and it seemed to work perfectly fine, he doesn’t like Linux though.</p>

<p>The drivers yes. I had this issue with one of my computers, when I installed Windows XP, I didn’t have any of the drivers.</p>
<p>So what you should do is Google, or go do Dell’s website and they should have a place to download the drivers there. All you need it do is put the Computer Model or whatever it is, and it gives you a long list of drivers. All you really need is to get connected to the internet, and then Windows usually grabs the rest of them for their dumb software updates.</p>
