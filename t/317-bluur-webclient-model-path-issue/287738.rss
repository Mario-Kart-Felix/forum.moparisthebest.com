    <title>317 (Bluur) WebClient. model path issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-bluur-webclient-model-path-issue/287738</link>
    <description>hello,
i&#39;ve been able to make a webclient working, but im still having an issue with newer models, e,g statius warhammer, vesta longsword. etc.
i have all the models required in the models folder. located in client.jar. i have all the int&#39;s required in class 8.
when i go in game and use the add model command it says &#39;cant find model xxxx&#39; and when i used the add models command it says &#39;syntax: ::add model &lt;path&gt;&#39; the syntax i used was: add models &lt;./models/&gt; and add models ./models/
but so far. no effect. whats the correct path?
can anyone help me with this? thanks![br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 08, 2009, 09:24:50 pm[/size][hr]never mind. 
tried to add the models before jarring the client. and that solved it.</description>
