    <title>Wtf? My Hardrive</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-my-hardrive/5845</link>
    <description>Well I was going to download some programs, when I get a errror saying my hardrive is low in space.

Now I know this can&#39;t be because I have like 14gb free space, so I went and looked at my hardrive and yes it was down to 113mb!!!

 I searched the drive to find out what was taking up so much dam space, when I come across my folder for my Xp account. I ran my mouse over it and it was saying there is 14gb of stuff in there!

I looked thru it and only found bout 1mb of stuff on there lol

Anyways I was wondering why the hell its doing this. Maybe there is like a critical error in the drive it self or something?

Well I think ill just end up deleteing this account, but first I&#39;d like to hear from you guys.

Thanks, MoO</description>

<p>You may also want to disable hibernate (if using XP). Go to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Performance and Maintenance &gt; Power Options &gt; Hibernate tab and uncheck the box.</p>
