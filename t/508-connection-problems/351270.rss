              <p>Well my best guess would be in the net packet for all connections.  I did add a protect.java file which helps to stop spammers and nullers greatly.  I dont know if these extra checks would be causing the problem?  Its my common sense that tells me its with the connection files since connection is the problem.  If theres another problem causing this that has nothing to do with connections, I would need a hint.  I do remember most of the changes from commands to adding trade.</p>

              <p>One, my computer is far from crap.  Its better than my old hosting computer.  I could see how customs cause this, but I do not use any customly made items, I’ve only renamed a few items from the item.cfg.  There is two instances that either everyone will lag for a few seconds and resume a stable state or one person logs in and everyone else DCs without being able to reconnect.  Usually after a few server restarts it goes back to normal.  I’ve used this source (ranopscape or something like that) or about a year.  The first time I had it, there was no problem like this.  Then a year later, i’m getting this kind of problem and yes I have greatly changed the source.</p>

              <p>Server source you are using, and maybe just maybe that players might have an unsupported item like a custom you installed into the client and when he wears it and logs in it crashers the server because i have seen it happen that way.</p>
