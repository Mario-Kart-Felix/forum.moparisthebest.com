Doesn’t really matter if it is 127.0.0.1 it will connect to your internet, mine is 127.0.0.1 and it works fine as people login and when i shut down my server i can’t login, so if people say you need it as your ip their wrong, though t is better to have your source ip to your ip. Plus client ip doesn’t really need to be your ip either. My cousin said it shouldn’t really damage you.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br>
[/quote]<br>
what are you talking about…</p>
<p>you connect on localhost (127.0.0.1) and your players connect on your no-ip or whatever.[/quote]</p>

<p>My client is on 127.0.0.1 and 20 people connect daily so don’t say what am i talking about because i do know what iam, your source grabs from the rinter byte and it reads it and transmits it to your computer wireless.[/quote]</p>

              <p>[quote=“Project Amazed Carlos, post:2, topic:510874”]Doesn’t really matter if it is 127.0.0.1 it will connect to your internet, mine is 127.0.0.1 and it works fine as people login and when i shut down my server i can’t login, so if people say you need it as your ip their wrong, though t is better to have your source ip to your ip. Plus client ip doesn’t really need to be your ip either. My cousin said it shouldn’t really damage you.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.[/quote]<br>
