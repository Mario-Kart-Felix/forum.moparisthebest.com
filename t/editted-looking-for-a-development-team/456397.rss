    <title>[Editted] Looking for a Development Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editted-looking-for-a-development-team/456397</link>
    <description>Well I have always dreamed of running a successful server with a lot of players online at the same time! I have a way that I&#39;d like a private server to be run and kept.

I cannot code very well, but I&#39;d like to have a development team that can code and fix bugs and such.


I want it to be a 317.
I would like this server to be economy based and rares be actually rare.
I&#39;d like the staff to be professional and the development team to be able to know what they are doing.
I want absolutely no custom items or npc&#39;s.
I&#39;d like it to be a little easier than real rs, but not too easy.
Most importantly, I want the players to be heard and have a say in the community.

If this server gets popular enough, I will purchase a VPS, webhost, and a Domain.

Owner - Masterlop

Development Team - (None Currently)


Application:

1. Why do you want to help me with this project?

2. Why do you want to join the development team?

3. Your experience coding?

4. Age?

5. MSN Name?</description>
