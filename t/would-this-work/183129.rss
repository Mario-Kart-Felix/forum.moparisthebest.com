    <title>Would this work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-this-work/183129</link>
    <description>Idk why I never thought of it sooner, or why no one else did by now, but I have an idea for the tutorials section. You see, we could build a similar system to the solve reports system for the tutorials section. It would show a special icon when it was a new tutorial and a normal icon (selected by the user or default) when it is approved. This means there would obviously be the need for an &#39;approve button&#39;. Anyway, on to the point. The staff member who is approving it must make sure it follows proper rules and also must ask the user to ask one general question about the tutorial. If they cannot answer it, obviously they do not know what they are talking about or they stole the tutorial.

Now, the tricky part would be making unapproved topics only viewable by staff members to prevent unneeded clutter of unapproved topics in the section. Also, I think they system should lock that board for that user for a certain amount of time after that to 1) prevent mass spam and 2) to prevent the person from posting again thinking &quot;my tutorial didnt post...&quot;. The error message could simply be, &quot;You have recently posted in this board, please wait for your topic to be approved.&quot;

The system should also send an email to the user whether or not the topic was approved or disproved (which results in a deletion/move to the rubbish bin) and a personal message from the moderator. Lothy said ages ago that the forums would be better off if the moderators were more involved and sincere in a personal way, well, I think he was right.

One final thing, the &#39;question&#39; part of this whole system would have to be based as a techincal question about the background of the topic. For instance, if someone would make a tutorial on using packet 122 (packet used when burying bones), then I think the question should be something like, &quot;what does readSignedWordBigEndianA() in the stream class do?&quot; or something along those lines. It does not have to be directly relevant to the tutorial, but somewhat relevant. Proper Java conventions used in the tutorial or not used would be a large factor in whether or not it is approved as well.

I think this should balance out the tutorial section more than just moderators can do. It will prevent all of the old &quot;leeching&quot; shizzat and prevent unneeded and otherwise pointless tutorials.</description>

Oh, I always thought the wiki was for mopar in general. However, Mitb wiki should be for mitb tuts, and mscp for tuts. And remove the boards.</p>

              <p>Idk why I never thought of it sooner, or why no one else did by now, but I have an idea for the tutorials section. You see, we could build a similar system to the solve reports system for the tutorials section. It would show a special icon when it was a new tutorial and a normal icon (selected by the user or default) when it is approved. This means there would obviously be the need for an ‘approve button’. Anyway, on to the point. The staff member who is approving it must make sure it follows proper rules and also must ask the user to ask one general question about the tutorial. If they cannot answer it, obviously they do not know what they are talking about or they stole the tutorial.</p>
<p>Now, the tricky part would be making unapproved topics only viewable by staff members to prevent unneeded clutter of unapproved topics in the section. Also, I think they system should lock that board for that user for a certain amount of time after that to 1) prevent mass spam and 2) to prevent the person from posting again thinking “my tutorial didnt post…”. The error message could simply be, “You have recently posted in this board, please wait for your topic to be approved.”</p>
<p>The system should also send an email to the user whether or not the topic was approved or disproved (which results in a deletion/move to the rubbish bin) and a personal message from the moderator. Lothy said ages ago that the forums would be better off if the moderators were more involved and sincere in a personal way, well, I think he was right.</p>
<p>One final thing, the ‘question’ part of this whole system would have to be based as a techincal question about the background of the topic. For instance, if someone would make a tutorial on using packet 122 (packet used when burying bones), then I think the question should be something like, “what does readSignedWordBigEndianA() in the stream class do?” or something along those lines. It does not have to be directly relevant to the tutorial, but somewhat relevant. Proper Java conventions used in the tutorial or not used would be a large factor in whether or not it is approved as well.</p>
<p>I think this should balance out the tutorial section more than just moderators can do. It will prevent all of the old “leeching” shizzat and prevent unneeded and otherwise pointless tutorials.</p>
