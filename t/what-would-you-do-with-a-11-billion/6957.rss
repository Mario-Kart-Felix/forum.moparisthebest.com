Buy a house, people I like can hang at my house too. Buy luxurious things. Or live on an island.<br>
Finish school, go to college. Get a job, be very smart. A Boss of some sort of smart business.<br>
So i can be so rich, I’m a celebrity. Pass on my money to my family.</p>
<p>You guys had alot of horrid answers, btw. With a heart like that, I don’t think you’ll ever get the money.</p>
