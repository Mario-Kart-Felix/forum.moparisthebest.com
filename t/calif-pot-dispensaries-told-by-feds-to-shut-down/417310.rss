Maybe I had the wrong impression then. Your states/fed sound like our provinces/fed</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">but how come your states control laws such as muder, … hell u can shoot a trespasser in texas. if muder was a federal crime, then it would actually be illegal to shoot trespassers.</span></p>
<p>states should control healthcare you say? Then why are feds controlling it, by closing down medicine dispensaries. Feds don’t see marijuana as medicine, but thats irrelevant, because thats a healthcare issue, to be controlled by state.<br>
[/quote]Gun laws are different in every state and trespassing and self defense laws differ in every state.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats what i dont understand though. shouldn’t the states be controlling drugs?</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:23, topic:417310”]<span class="bbcode-b">Federal:</span><br>
International shit<br>
Laws and policies that affect everyone (but don’t interfere with state rights)<br>
Federal crimes<br>
Military<br>
Federal tax for federal shit</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">State:</span><br>
Schools<br>
State Universities<br>
Healthcare (should)<br>
Social Security (should)<br>
Voting<br>
Licenses<br>
State tax for shit<br>
infrastructure[/quote]</p>
<p>doesnt seem accurate to me. seems to me your states control laws that effect everyone. and the feds go after terminally ill people just trying to get medicine.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Newty, post:8, topic:417310”]I think that the dispensaries in Michigan just went through pretty much the same process… In northern michigan lately they’ve (the police and feds) have busted a huge amount of MM cardholders for growing more then what they were allotted to grow. This really irratates me because I knew from the get-go that the government was going to abuse their regulatory power over cardholders. I think its unfair that they can pick from a giant list of cardholders and raid there houses without any proof that they are exceeding their allotted limit. It recently happened to my uncle and now he’s going to lose his card, have to pay fines, and face possible jail time.</p>
<p>But lo and be hold people who get MIPS get slaps on the wrist and even first time DUI offences aren’t as bad as what they’re doing to people that use pot. I call bullshit on the governments control over our economy and our freedoms in America.[/quote]It’s called the PATRIOT ACT</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>no kidding… And just when you think you understand it, it throws a hard ball at you. ie, why can the feds make personal possession laws in the first place?</p>
<p>Law is simple in Canada. All criminal law is federal-wide. We’re ok with that. But Americans shouldn’t be. Excuse my ignorance, but is this not unconstitutional?[/quote]<br>
We have federal crimes here. Its just easier because since we allow the states to control prisons and authority you might aswell allow them to control the rest. Basically if a kid steals CDs from a store the federal courts shouldn’t be bothered.</p>

States aren’t supposed to be independent countries<br>
[/quote]<br>
Why not? If you don’t like what the fed does, say good bye.<br>
I don’t see that any of the states would have any problems as a separate country.[/quote]<br>
Really? So when our country split for the first time that wasn’t enough? States are there because obviously a congressman in washington won’t know enough about Nevada’s local problems to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Look at it this way</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Federal:</span><br>
International shit<br>
Laws and policies that affect everyone (but don’t interfere with state rights)<br>
Federal crimes<br>
Military<br>
Federal tax for federal shit</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">State:</span><br>
Schools<br>
State Universities<br>
Healthcare (should)<br>
Social Security (should)<br>
Voting<br>
Licenses<br>
State tax for shit<br>
infrastructure<br>
But they can’t do anything that challenges the fed (the back and forth of this is defined in the constitution)</p>
<p>Basically the fed is supposed to control the big shit and the states are supposed to control domestic issues, because they live within it.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t out legal system, the problem is people pulling the roots from our legal foundation - the Constitution. When you challenge the Constitution this kind of confusion starts, and this is one of the reasons for our debt.</p>
<p>This is why when Americans say “The fed shouldn’t give people welfare checks!” we aren’t ragging on the welfare of the people, we’re getting pissed on the government sucking power from the states.</p>
<p>Im taking government right now and its amazing how far we are from what our founding fathers envisioned.</p>
