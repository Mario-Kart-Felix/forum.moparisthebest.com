    <description>Can Anyone Make A Tut (Or Just Post Here) On How To Change Monster&#39;s Max Hit? Right Now, My Jad is Hitting A Max of 4s. I&#39;ve Tried Changing It&#39;s Lvl, But That Doesn&#39;t Appear To Do Anything.

Thanks.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 25, 2008, 10:22:50 pm[/size][hr]Found out. For anyone that wondering, go into your npchandler and search for [code]newNPC.MaxHit = (int)Math.floor((HP / [/code] and change the number right of the /. The lower the number, the higher the hit. I&#39;ve found changing it from 100 to 50 or 60 works a lot better. (75 is still pansy, 60 is a little stronger, and 50 makes Jad hit like 50s)</description>
