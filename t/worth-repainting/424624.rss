    <title>Worth repainting?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/worth-repainting/424624</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had my car for over a year and a half now, done over 30,000km on it. The paint is quite bad and it has got a little rust on the car. I am wondering if it is worth repainting the car (removing rust in the process) in an attempt to keep it alive for another 5 or so years.

It is a 1988 Corolla FX GT with 328100km on the clock - the engine still runs perfectly.

Rust on the firewall - a previous owner bogged that up:

Maori paintjob over dent on back corner:

Bit of rust above the doors:

General overview of the car (my brother has some rims from another car that will fit this once my tyres are out of tread in about 60,000 km XD.):

Oh, and that hub cover was cracked when I stole the wheels of my friend&#39;s paddock car.</description>
