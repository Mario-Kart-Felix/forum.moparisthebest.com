    <description>[center][IMG]http://i1098.photobucket.com/albums/g378/jerkinwhite/WaronCamelotbanner.jpg[/img]

Hello, and welcome to my recent project: War on Camelot.

I hosted it for a while, but I didn&#39;t get as many players as I&#39;d hoped. I&#39;m going to be moving on to a new project now, so I figured I&#39;d release.

This isn&#39;t a crappy Cammy PvP base. It is based off Project Insanity/DSPK. It is highly edited and has many new features. I started this because I was tired of seeing Cammy PvP bases everywhere. Hopefully they&#39;ll use PI now. I learned a lot during this project, and it was a lot of fun. I hope you guys will learn as much as I have and benefit from this release.

[b]Things that were already on server:[/b]
Has a lot of bosses
Clue scrolls
Gambling
New items, eg. Dragon Masks
508+ graphics, anims, objects, etc

That&#39;s about the only things that were good, lol.


[b]Things I added:[/b]
The BEST skilling zone, imo. Worked on it a lot.
Easter Event
World PvP
Customized Cammy bank (home)
Spawning, you can&#39;t spawn items like Godswords, need to be obtained by bosses or by other means. (wanted there to be somewhat of an economy)
Party room is multi
A pure pk zone, where you need 45 defence or less to enter
An herblore quest to start herblore, it isn&#39;t finished though

There&#39;s a lot more, just can&#39;t remember it all right now  :P

              <p>Tbh, I hate 317 loading whatever it is, i think 508. I just dislike them. I may sound stupid, I love this source, but with my shit 64 bit computer the paths never work and i changed my classpath and i screwed it up. If this was 474 or 317 it would be AWESOME.
