    <description>Hi, I am currently trying to find out if there Is a way to review your history of what servers you have played on?
I was a donator on one particular server and would like to start playing again. If anyone could give me any clues to the name of the server that would be a big help. My paypal history says i made a donation to a &#39;Dominic Mcdonald&#39;, just wondering if anyone knows him at all.</description>

Firstly, you are a fucken idiot, RSPS’s aren’t illegal to the player.<br>
What the hell are you going to do with a cache? The cache are named after the servers 99% of the time, and even if they are not, they often have the ip address or at least a recent connection log to the server. That what the hell you do with a cache.<br>
Guess what, he just got his way out of this one.<br>
/Check mate.[/quote]<br>
Wait, what are you smoking? Cache’s don’t contain the recent connection to a server, only the person who has the server files<br>
What are you going to do with an ip?, and if a owner does keep a ip log there, his last ip connection is most likely to be 127.0.0.1<br>
and<br>
Whats a name? A server name? Wow what is that going to do? Any computer has the function to rename. There is no proof whatsoever whether its those Pi Clients the person leeches, a person who does this<br>
is probably a person with no experience. He stole the cache from another person, so therefore, you find the person, but the cache doesn’t belong to him.</p>
<p>Shutup you didn’t help him at all Just stick to my solution.</p>

I was a donator on one particular server and would like to start playing again. If anyone could give me any clues to the name of the server that would be a big help. My paypal history says i made a donation to a ‘Dominic Mcdonald’, just wondering if anyone knows him at all.</p>
