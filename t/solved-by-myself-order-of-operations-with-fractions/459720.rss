    <description>Question was 

1/6 x 3/4 + 5/12 divided by 1/18th

My answer was 15/2 (Had to reduce.)

How is this wrong?

I went over it like 5 times and I still get the same answer.


1/6 x 3/4 + 5/12 divided by 1/18th

1/6 x 3/4 = 1/8

1/8 + 5/12 divided by 1/18th

5/12 divided by 1/18th = 15/2

1/8 + 15/2 = [s]60/8[/s]

I see now its 61/8 i forgot to add the one, as so


1/8 + 15/2

1/8 + 60/8

61/8

Such a simple mistake</description>

<p>You could just look in your math book, see what you were doing wrong, and have it fixed in 10 minutes.  Then there wouldn’t even be a need to post on here.</p>
<p>And one last thing, who really looks like the dick here?</p>
