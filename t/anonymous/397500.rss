First, no one here has even said they are a member.<br>
Second, just because we’re on other communities means we’re couldn’t be part of Anonymous. (Please tell me if part of the “Anonymous Guide” says that Anonymous members are not allowed to be part of other communities.)<br>
And third, how do you know that nobody here has gone to protests? You don’t.</p>

It originally started off as a reference to the names imageboards would use(anonymous). When all the Scientology shit rolled around is when the name really stuck, because the Anon’s didn’t want Scientology to know their information.

<p>No one on this site is a true member if anonymous at that either, so don’t try to act like you are.</p>
<p>[/quote]<br>
And how would you know? The whole idea is that they’re anonymous. So you wouldn’t know if someone is a member, would you?[/quote]<br>
^ This</p>
<p>Also, may I point out, Anonymous members don’t do these things for attention, they don’t care if you know your a member of this ideal system. They don’t do things for glory, they do them because its the right thing to do. Also if any member were to say they were one would be completely stupid because there are many laws that are broken in the process of attacks on sites and servers that can be constricted at a federal level. Plus I don’t know many 15 year olds (not being directed to anyone here) that can preform the tasks needed for the hacking side of their operations.</p>

Noi nu uita, nu ne iartă, ne aşteaptă.</p>
