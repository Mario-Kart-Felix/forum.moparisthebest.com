<p>^ This guy speaks the truth. ^[/quote]<br>
all these ppl are right. i have a server hoster, but i code the servers myself and i add stuff here and there, i also give proper credit to the hoster. so plz start learning how to code and do these things for yourself. if i can do it so can you. i have had almost no java exp yet im able to completely manage and code a server to my advantage, i can now also code because of the moparscape community. so if you need help with something post it here, just try to atleast do some of the stuff yourself. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
