How do i change:
ReapageScape V2
Now Online     =D

to:
KenshinScape
Now Online   FTW!!

i dont want to claim it as my own. I state that peacefully, mainly because i want to release this soon after i fix a few more items. I have changed up skittlez385&#39;s client a bit so it would be very compatable with my server. NOTE: I JUST ADMITTED I USE SOMEONE ELSES CLIENT!! That should be proof enuf i dont want to claim it as myn. I just dont want people to think its gonna just be a exact copy of Reapage. Mainly because very little on it is still the same. (only barows is the same). Im changing that into a minigame later.</description>
