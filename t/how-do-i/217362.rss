    <title>How do I....?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i/217362</link>
    <description>I have a question how would I make it so when you click an npc a thing comes up saying :Would you like to go to pest control?
On the top and then two options Yes then No so sort of like this and when they click yes they get teleported but when they click no they just exit out.

[center][i]Would you like to go to pest control?[/i][/center]
[center]YES[/center]
[center]NO[/center]

I know it goes in first click npc I just don&#39;t remember how to make it do that so can someone give me the layout or another code like that so I can edit it?</description>
