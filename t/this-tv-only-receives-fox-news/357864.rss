    <title>This TV only receives Fox news</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-tv-only-receives-fox-news/357864</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Yesterday, I was at the Four Points Sheraton Hotel in Chambersburg, PA, and on the wall was a television set tuned to FOX News.

The manager told me to feel free to change the channel, but pointed out that the TV was set up to only show news channels.

So, I tried to tune in MSNBC, but no dice. 
Same thing with CNN.

The TV in the Four Points Sheraton only receives ONE channel – FOX. All  other stations, including other news stations, are blocked.

Same thing with the TVs in ALL of the McDonald’s restaurants here in the south central part of PA – and the managers at the local MickyD’s say that FOX is the ONLY station they are allowed to show, as per orders from company headquarters, though the company headquarters, Delamor Enterprises in Chambersburg, PA, denied that this was the case when I wrote to them this summer. 
One store associate in Waynesboro, PA told me that that FOX is the only station they are allowed to show because FOX is a &quot;family friendly&quot; channel that appeals to all ages. I wasn&#39;t aware that preschoolers are now into Glenn Beck, but then, maybe I&#39;m behind the times.

So, who exactly is paying all these hotels and restaurants to show only ONE point of view in their dining rooms and lobbies?

The funny thing is (and I’m giving away my age here) that back during the Cold War, we were taught in school that one major feature of COMMUNISM was that in Communist countries, they had only one or two TV stations, which broadcast the party line. We were taught that this was a BAD thing.

CONTINUED&lt;/blockquote&gt;

America is a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatocracy]corporatocracy[/url].

That&#39;s the beauty of privatization and small numbers of enormous corporations. Fewer and fewer choices, fewer possessors of rights.</description>

<p>I’ve never watched the BBC for news (or for anything else for that matter).  As I said above, you get both points of view and the truth is somewhere in the middle.</p>

Actually its not freedom, its a kind of censorship.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Then a store/hotel/restaurant with a TV only showing CNN would be a kind of censorship too, right?  Perhaps we should pass a law requiring there to be 3 TVs in every place with a TV, one showing CNN, FOX, and NBC?  Maybe ABC too then.  Would that be fair?  Don’t be ridiculous. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Bit of a strawman no? I wasn’t advocating anything like that.</p>
<p>All I meant was to point out the similarity between communist government organisations broadcasting propaganda and the free market organisations doing the same.<br>
As the news article said, it seems McDonalds and the rest actually get paid to only show Fox. It makes people suspicious of News Corp’s motives when they pay for the TV, running costs and extra to McDonalds for showing their channel.<br>
Not only that, it also goes against the free market principles of choice. For everything to work properly people have to be free to choose between different television channels, but what News Corp. have done is mix the choice of TV channel with the choice of hamburger. You can’t have only the hamburger or channel, you gotta have both.</p>
<p>The main reason I stopped supporting communism was because it had little democracy, so those in power could do what they want since there was no mechanism to remove them. I’m doubtful this free market society in America has enough democracy either.</p>
<p>I can completely understand why the BBC license fee sounds totally abhorrent at first glance. But the BBC’s totally impartial news is the only thing that seperates us from the ravages of the Murdock press.</p>

<p>Remember watching a report on how headscarfs were banned at a Turkish school sports lessons because the teachers reckoned you can’t play football wearing a hijab.<br>
Aljazeera obviously took the Islamic angle rather than what in my view was the common-sense angle.</p>
<p>Obviously just one example doesn’t prove anything but I’ll try to find the clip if i can.</p>

<p>That license fee is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard of, it sounds like it basically created a forced tax-payer funded monopoly.  PBS is funded by voluntary donations and such.  I like the capitalistic approach to TV, sure <span class="bbcode-s">some</span> all channels are biased, but no one should believe everything they hear, and the truth is always somewhere in the middle.</p>

His father was 5 when it started and almost 10 when it ended. Then people “ohh duh he misspoke he meant grandfather” Uhh… no.</p>
<p>And what do you know, every channel except for Fox (barely) mentioned this. Thats why I prefer Fox, other networks dont want to talk about anything that doesnt support him. But i watch almost all news channels.</p>
<p>And there are times when fox will take an entire clip of one of CNN’s stories and pull it apart to show you what they changed in the story. As i said before, Fox slams all leaders. They will “seemingly” make all of our presidents look like idiots for reporting factual stories, they arent in favor of either.</p>

<p>Then a store/hotel/restaurant with a TV only showing CNN would be a kind of censorship too, right?

<p>You can watch Fox news and hate glenn beck and rush etc. And i know people who do.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thing is, there usually is a connection between the news programs and the other programs shown on a station. For instance, here we have SBS6, a station that is ridded with commercials and lives of programs like ‘So you think you can dance’ and ‘Holland’s got talent’. But that’s not all! They have a news program too, which doesn’t mention any foreign news, and the domestic news usually revolves around cats being stuck in trees. It even has a special segment called ‘Shownews’, which gives us all news sane people don’t care about, like the feud between two gay showhosts.</p>
