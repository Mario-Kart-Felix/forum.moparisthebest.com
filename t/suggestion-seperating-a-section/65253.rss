    <title>[SUGGESTION] Seperating a section</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-seperating-a-section/65253</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;ve noticed recently that in the &quot;Development/Help&quot; section of moparisthebest.com/smf is being over-run by &quot;newbs&quot; posting stupid help topics, and tehre are virtually NO development topics, and even the development topics that are there are lost after 30 mins by all of the senseless help topics.

My suggestion is split this section into two, Development, and Help. That way the development topics are clearly apart from the sense-less help topics.

What do you think?

              <p>It will still not make a difference. Out of the ninety thousand members, at least eighty thousand or more have joined primarily because of private servers (my statistics are probably off.) Now, when you have that many people seeing one (two in this case) Boards that are designated for help, and then you take that away from them (even if it is the one word), than they are going to go everywhere with their questions. Both ways, wether you remove the word or not, they are still going to have questions and <span class="bbcode-i">are</span> going to ask them. Plus, we can’t ban everyone.</p>

              <p>To separate Boards would be to rename and make a new one. The renaming part would take about two minutes, maybe less. But to create a new one, he would have to create a new Board, edit a few PHP files on both the Moparisthebest server and the MoparScape server so that the new Board ID will be viewable only on MoparScape. That could take a few more minutes, depending on many things. This is why Moparisthebest does not create new Boards on MoparScape.</p>

Time consuming? You have to be joking. It will take all of 2 minutes to rename that board to help, and make a new one called Development. Is there no other Admin that has access to this?<br>

<p>Fused forums. The way the two separate forums access a single database is what makes it hard. Otherwise, yeah it would be a 2 minute job.</p>

<p>Stop disrespecting other members.</p>
<p>[quote=“Budda, post:1, topic:65253”]Well, I’ve noticed recently that in the “Development/Help” section of <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> is being over-run by “newbs” posting stupid help topics, and tehre are virtually NO development topics, and even the development topics that are there are lost after 30 mins by all of the senseless help topics.</p>
<p>My suggestion is split this section into two, Development, and Help. That way the development topics are clearly apart from the sense-less help topics.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>~ Budda[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, it is a good idea. But, it is time consuming for Moparisthebest to create new Boards for MoparScape forums. No matter what happens, people will still be looking for somewhere to post their help questions and topics.</p>

              <p>Yeah, but really. I try to advertise my development ideas in there, I’ve done it a few times, and I get all of 3 posts because simply nobody sees the thread, it gets lost nearly straight away.[br][size=1]Posted on: March 06, 2007, 09:37:51 PM[/size][hr]Just to show you what I mean.

              <p>I think even getting rid of the word “help” would do the trick. The “noobs”(lack of a better word) seem to read too quickly, and I think that as soon as they see the word Help in a section then they rush into it with their questions.</p>
<p>I only recently starting going to the moparscape forums since 99% of reports come from there, but I noticed that too. And there is just too many topics there to possibly move into the moparscape questions section.</p>
