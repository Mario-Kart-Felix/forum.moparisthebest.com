    <description>Hey Moparscape, I was wondering if somebody could help me with getting my server online! Im currently running a matrix 718. I have teamviewer and no-ip DUC. My xfinity has the portforwarding option on the advanced setting and everything I just need help getting it all worked out! Comment below and I will PM you my user id and password for teamviewer! thank you so much:)
