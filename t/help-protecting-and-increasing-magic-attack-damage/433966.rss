    <title>Help! Protecting and Increasing Magic Attack Damage</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-protecting-and-increasing-magic-attack-damage/433966</link>
    <description>I have an InsidiaX base (Idk if it&#39;s an official base, known by everyone, but I have reason to believe that it&#39;s just been upgraded from a Hybrid PvP base)

Anyhoo.

I really need help on how to stop Magic attacks (from Corporeal Beast etc.) from hitting on players so hard (what bonus do I change etc? &gt;.&lt;)

Also, how do I make Magic casted from players (Staff of Light with Ancient Magics for example) hit higher?


PLEASE will someone help me this time, I&#39;m not getting a good feeling about these forums, no one seems to be answering my problems :s

<p>I’ve found some lines of code with notes explaining that they are melee, range, and magic damage, but I don’t know what I would do to make them hit higher. Any ideas?</p>
