    <title>562 Glitched Skills</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-glitched-skills/350328</link>
    <description>My 562 server is good in everything exept skills.. The problem is that when I train any skill and level it up , It gets glitched.

Example : I click a fishing stall , and I level my theiving from 1 to 23. Then when I go to see the skills tab it shows that theiving is 1/23. 
Example : When I make a new account and type ::master , all my skills become 1/99 . Only hp can be brought up to 99/99 by eating or dieng , and other skills with a strength potion , attack potion , ect.

How do i make it so , when you die it brings the skills back to its regular level
Example : When I die by a npc or player , all my skills that are 1/99 become back to 99/99 or if i had 1/80 it goes back to 80/80

I wrote lot of examples since a staff member wrote a topic of to explain good :)</description>

              <p>You may have a method called refreshSkills() some where in the server, add that method into your process. I’ve never actually used a 562 server tho…</p>
