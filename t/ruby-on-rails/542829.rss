    <description>Hi guys, I&#39;ve been interested in learning web. development and certain programming languages in general, and discovered through a friend that RoR would be better off to learn before a language such as php. I don&#39;t really know anything about the language itself besides it using a framework called &quot;rails&quot; to assist for web. development, but I&#39;d like some resources to gather so I could start learning how to utilize it&#39;s code, what it does, and so on.  

I recently purchased this book (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118008189/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) regarding html and css. I&#39;m nearly half way through it and it covered pretty much what I already knew about HTML. I&#39;m just about getting started on the CSS chapters. I&#39;m trying to make my way through web. development as well as designing. 

If anyone has some recommendations for books on it, I&#39;d be more than delighted to purchase some. (preferably through Amazon) I&#39;d also hope if someone could spare a few doc links on RoR or any other web. development assists that could help me.</description>

We are a site dedicated to programming with actual programmers. You don’t need a degree to call yourself one. Just because we are a small niche doesn’t mean we aren’t a site properly equipped for these types of questions.[/quote]</p>
<p>Moparscape isn’t a site dedicated to <span class="bbcode-i">just</span> programming, and you don’t have to be an actual programmer (meaning that you have a degree) to answer or ask questions about programming.</p>
<p>Moparscape is a forums, not a Q&amp;A setup. If you look at the boards here, you see boards like Games, Graphics, Reviews and Multimedia, Music, etc. The statement <span class="bbcode-i">we are a site dedicated to programming with actual programmers</span>, is completely invalid. The description for StackOverflow is…</p>
<blockquote>[b]Stack Overflow[/b] is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. It's 100% free, no registration required.</blockquote>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Moparscape’s </span>slogan is <span class="bbcode-i">The Mother of RS Private Servers</span>. Which is mostly true. If anything, these forums are more directed towards Runescape private servers.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/srbuckey5266">@SRBuckey5266</a> - Moparscape has <span class="bbcode-i">boards</span> for programming, and those boards are usually where programmers hang out. Someone with out a degree can <span class="bbcode-i">easily</span> know more than someone who has a degree. It doesn’t matter if someone is <span class="bbcode-i">actual</span>, there isn’t necessarily a thing as an <span class="bbcode-i">actual</span> programmer. I do agree that if a user has a question, and they ask here and don’t get a response, their next step should be StackOverflow.</p>
