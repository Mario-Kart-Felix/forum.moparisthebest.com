<p>Being the only smart one there, I went on the comp across from it, went on rs, went to change pass, saw his pass, changed it, waited, saw his recoverys, used em to get pass, changed recoverys and pass, went on his account and went for a joy ride.</p>

<p>How exactly did you ‘see’ his pass and ‘see’ his recoveries?</p>
<p>[quote=“predalienrunner, post:6, topic:151569”]No it shouldn’t get you banned… unless you trade 10 million gp for nothing. They account for internet cafes and hooked up computers which all have the same ip.<br>
also use search to find threads on other ways and that delve into a bit more detail.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yea don’t worry about getting banned.  If you want to make sure you’re safe, use Tor.  It’s what I use when I scam accounts.</p>
