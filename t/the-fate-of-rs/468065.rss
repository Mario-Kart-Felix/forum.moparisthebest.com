              <p>Why the fuck is this a debate? If RS is still online then so be it, if they go offline then so be it? Is a discussion really needed to discuss a game that these forums are based off? Plus this should be in RS Discussion. This thread is pointless.</p>

Yeah, pretty much.  I personally botted some, but I only ever did it on one small side account, training dungeoneering and fishing, cooking, etc, I never really had 10 clients going and I rarely sold anything, most of my money was made by merching logs.</p>

              <p>Considering how much Runescape has changed since 2005, who knows where the fuck it’ll go. Technology changes constantly, something new is being invented/worked on right now in the technology world, and always is. As the world gets better technology, game companies like Runescape will slowly adapt, we really cannot know, or even guess where it’s going. Especially with Runescape, as some of their updates and changes are completely unexpected.</p>
