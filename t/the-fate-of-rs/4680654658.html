I agree. They also should have deeper penalties on bots. Instead of banning somebody, they should do a complete wipe of the account. Put it back to the start. Would discourage people from botting on their mains.</p>

Yeah, pretty much.  I personally botted some, but I only ever did it on one small side account, training dungeoneering and fishing, cooking, etc, I never really had 10 clients going and I rarely sold anything, most of my money was made by merching logs.</p>
