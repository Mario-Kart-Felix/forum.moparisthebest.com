    <description>That the Official MoparScape server has taken a serious set back.

Namely, we&#39;ve lost our main and only developer: Sini (sinisoul). He worked alone on the server, putting in many hours to create the most efficient and time compatible solutions to problems. It&#39;s safe to say his work will be sorely missed, even more so because it will be unfinished. Our ex-developer, Sini, has his prospects set on a new game entirely called Thornefall founded by a reputable member, and ex-administrator Taharok (Avail). I&#39;d like to personally thank sini for his dedication, and ask others to respect his decision to focus on another project instead.

The show must go on, there was recently a small staff meeting regarding the situation and I&#39;d like to personally invite the thoughts of the community too. It&#39;s always very disappointing and familiar when community projects fail, I funded this one myself without the assistance of moparisthebest and I feel a deep sense of loss for all the time and money I&#39;ve invested but we mustn&#39;t let this set us back. Already a plan has been drawn up to host another server where content is a lot more existent and updates for this will be due within the next few weeks, others may complain this isn&#39;t an achievable dream but consistency is key with anything. 

We do need your help, gathering data such as drops and NPC locations, so if you&#39;re able to do even the most basic of tasks please drop me a PM! :) Once again, you&#39;ve my sincerest apologies for this, but there is only so much I&#39;m able to do. :(

You can find sini&#39;s personal reasoning below:

[quote=&quot;sini, post:1, topic:553212&quot;]I&#39;m sorry to announce publicly that after today I will no longer be involved with the official server or any serious Runescape emulation projects. I say that with a heavy heart, and I&#39;m grateful to Tom and Davidi2 for the chance and time we spent together trying to create an emulator for the community. I&#39;ve been apart of many projects over the years and I&#39;ve met a lot of great people but I feel as if my time with Runescape emulation has grown beyond that of what can help me grow as a programmer and that I need to move on. Notably I had a great time working on the Moparscape server, both the original and my rendition, PRS06, my creations, and Silabgarza. I wouldn&#39;t be the programmer I am today without this community and I don&#39;t regret the hundreds of hours I spent trying to push the boundaries of emulators or research new topics.

I think this post, as dramatic as it may sound, is speaking to the community. Runescape is growing old, and the excitement that came with trying to discover how Jagex as a company operated at least for me died two years ago with the decline in the games popularity. My passion these past few years were driven by my taste to try and see a rise in the community, and have these adventures once more but I know now that isn&#39;t plausible. 

I was content on working on the server until recently I became involved with a project outside of Runescape emulation. This opportunity opened my eyes to the skills I could possess that are outside of emulation and the choice was simple. I have found that in the past year I have decided I want to get into game development so I can create a similar feeling to how I felt when I first loaded into Runescape about ten years ago with everyone.

I suggest to you that you try not to take this all as serious as some of you may, although taking this seriously is wise, I think everyone is really sensitive about how their image stands among people. I wish I spent more of my time instead of getting offended by how people saw me had more fun, and just enjoyed the ride. It went by fast, six years now I&#39;ve been developing servers since the age of 14 and now looking back I know at least I accomplished much. I had a lot of feuds, I made a lot of friends. Making emulators can lead to skills to land you a job but it&#39;s very limited because of the limitations of creativity you constrain yourself to. I found it hard to advance past the level I reached because I simply didnt understand all the nuances of the game client and the architecture of design.  People still are learning things today, and I think those skills are better applied to creating instead of emulating. There is a lot of talent here, it just needs better focus instead of wasting effort on something that is too niche.

With those remarks, thank you seriously to the following people. Silabsoft for providing a good bounty of information and security testing the server, Tom for helping me get the server to the point it was, Davidi2 for ideas and your dedication to trying to help me move my work forward, Taharok for giving me helpful advice on programming when I needed it, Lothy for bouncing ideas back and forth when we had nothing to do, Zuppers for testing and providing critical information for the server.

Thanks.[/quote]</description>

If I can quit a paid software job in which I hold a good proportion of the teams knowledge with just a weeks notice then a volunteer should be able to quit whenever they please. It’s up to the lead to manage knowledge retention, and if we as a community let one person take all that responsibility then we get what we deserve.</p>

<p>I think Tom and Zuppers have it handled from this point. But I mean, I know all of you would look forward to an official server but I think the time has long passed for it being possible. We’ll see what they do.</p>

<p>No. I was promised ad rev on completion. Tom wanted to push a web client quickly so this would be possible. But, I never was doing it for the money but the money would have been nice. I don’t think reliably that’s something you can come to expect from a RS server though. A lot of people do it for the money, I think it misguides their process of how they approach things.</p>

<p>It was pretty far along. I think farther along than most people would give it the time and day for. However Jagex, in their engine, had a lot of complex nuances I couldn’t figure out by myself that dealt with the HUD and I wasn’t comfortable trying to move forward without creating a system or systems that helped replicate it in an efficient manner. That’s where I got stuck. The period of time I’m talking about is when Jagex greatly overhauled their interface system into TWO different systems, and my god did that make things a pain in the ass to emulate. Frankly half of their engine is absolute garbage, the only thing I ever admired was their ability to be efficient.</p>

<p>I don’t see why that is difficult to understand, but you’re ok with the fact that he and others were investing a lot of time? I guess people have different priorities and I don’t know if he invested €10 or €10k, but I’d be more upset about wasting my time not a few euro.</p>

<p>RIFT and WoW are more similar than WoW and Allods. RIFT practically looks almost exactly like WoW, and no lawsuits have even been thought of. Thornefall and RS will be able to coexist, as Frell has stated. Jagex will probably make empty threats, however.<br>

RIFT and WoW are more similar than WoW and Allods. RIFT practically looks almost exactly like WoW, and no lawsuits have even been thought of. Thornefall and RS will be able to coexist, as Frell has stated. Jagex will probably make empty threats, however.<br>
[/quote]now I believe they should co-exist because competition makes for a better product, but i doubt it’ll be empty threats. It’ll come down to can TF have enough money for the lawsuits and fighting the empty threats to also exist on its own[/quote]<br>
tf is a game that will never come to fruition and even assuming a washed up project like a shitty runescape clone ever will come to that point is laughable</p>
