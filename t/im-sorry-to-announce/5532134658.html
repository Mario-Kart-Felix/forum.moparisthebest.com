        <p>Everyone has been saying for years that the reason there‚Äôs no good shit is because the good developers have better stuff to do with their time. The few good devs that do get involved only do it for the short space of time when they‚Äôre motivated by the game, or when they‚Äôre making the transition between being a noob and good enough to work on their own shit. Can‚Äôt blame them for that. Maybe a community server could be successful if we work out how to capitalise on this group of people and accept the fact that every dev will quit after a few months?</p>

        <p>As someone who can <span class="bbcode-b">strongly</span> relate to sini‚Äôs experience, I don‚Äôt blame him for going down the route he chose. Getting your hands dirty with RuneScape emulation is really fun. It‚Äôs a really tough programming challenge to write a server that holds thousands of players, in addition to writing the tons of systems that go into it, especially the content stage. Then you‚Äôve got client hacking, and there‚Äôs something unusually rewarding about creating tools that turn someone else‚Äôs mysterious data into something you can view and even edit. That was my motive behind writing my cache editor. I also really liked the idea of having people write plugins so instead of having just one person writing a massive editor for tons of different data types, people would be able to pitch in. Unfortunately, as with most RS-based projects, this vision didn‚Äôt become a reality despite all of the effort I put forth. In fact, I don‚Äôt think a single person uses my cache editor, but it was a fun project and learning experience. At the end of the day, that‚Äôs what all RuneScape projects are - fun and for the experience. Unfortunately, almost all of us want something more than that. We all like attention, difficult challenges, constantly growing, feeling like we‚Äôre a part of something big, and yes, even financial rewards. When writing something like a private server from scratch, or a cache editor, you‚Äôre in it for the fun and challenge mostly. There is no point to actually writing a server that supports 2000 players because you‚Äôll never get even a quarter of that, and so you can‚Äôt help but feel you‚Äôre wasting your time.</p>
<p>The point I‚Äôm trying to make is sort of the only real motive behind RS emulation and whatnot is personal interest, and when that‚Äôs gone, there isn‚Äôt much to keep you here. The people here pushing for the community server are probably just looking for an excuse to get back into RuneScape without the grind, fee, etc. I know that‚Äôs why I wanted to see it happen. If everyone wants the official server to get done so badly, then it‚Äôs going to take a <span class="bbcode-i">community</span> effort. Tasking one, or even two people with writing an entire server and content system is a huge undertaking. The best option is probably to start with a pre-written base that doesn‚Äôt handle like garbage and has a scripting system. The server doesn‚Äôt need to hold even 100 players, but if it ever gets to that point, then you can start looking at other options. Until then, writing a new base over and over, even though it gets better and better, isn‚Äôt going to get anyone anywhere but the guy behind it away from the project.</p>

        <p>Doing that by yourself with the amount of pitfalls and inefficient methods you follow you‚Äôre just asking for an up hill battle. I think its just futile. Why? We both know no one is going to help you, we both know you don‚Äôt have the time, and with the amount of time that‚Äôs required because there are so many John Does trying to set up servers how will it be any different than the ‚ÄòMopar‚Äô name behind it. If you‚Äôre still passionate about it, by all means. But I know for a fact you have no, and will not, put as much research into the nuances that me or other people have and I think that‚Äôs spitting on what could be accomplished. Those efforts are better spent elsewhere. Let nostalgia be nostalgia. Or even better create nostalgia for a new generation of gamers.</p>
<p>Like the gap between what we can never know and what we need to know is way to great to effectively emulate the new revisions. That ALWAYS was an issue. Do you want to spend a ton of time brute forcing and trying to determine file names from the cache? Do you want to write a CS2 decompiler? Do you want to try and decipher every packet, what it does, why? Do you want to effectively write all the systems to support everything in a simple manner? Do you want to write a persistence layer? Do you want to do the data dumping which takes a lot more time than coming up with your own ideas? Do you want to write a tool chain so you can implement new ideas effectively? Do you want to spend the time trying to efficiently design a way to serve files, host players, login players, keep track of other instances (worlds)?</p>
<p>No. You don‚Äôt. I did. So I took my passion to a project where I could work with people I could effectively do that and have it be worth it because the effort I put in with Thornefall directly translates to how successful it is. You want to create a meager feeling to what playing Runescape at that time would have been. Runescape as a game is literally clicking objects most of the time. To train, for hours. Who really enjoys going through that again. Just go do that on OSRS.</p>

wtf ignore that shit, it‚Äôs completely normal to work on throwaway projects even if you don‚Äôt initially intend them to be throwaway. the only reason projects succeed in industry is because they‚Äôre backed by money and have strong project management, and even that can be a bad thing.</p>

WoW was built from a preexisting art style from the Warcraft games and didn‚Äôt take that from EQ. I‚Äôm not referring to the fact that both games have magic or are medieval or the lore, I‚Äôm looking at the screenshots and gameplay video and seeing that you could almost overlay them on top of RS screenshots and a person that hasn‚Äôt played either (like a judge) might think they are the same game. Hell, even if they changed it to not be tile-based but kept the art style they had right now I‚Äôd still say Jagex might try to sue them. F<span class="bbcode-u"></span>uck, they can do whatever they want. I just know if I was ever asked to join a project like that I wouldn‚Äôt for a second assume it was going to be a safe source of income. If I had to guess I‚Äôd just say someone got a hardon after seeing your success with Blackwake and can‚Äôt tell the difference between a unique fun game with a nice niche market and a remake.</p>
