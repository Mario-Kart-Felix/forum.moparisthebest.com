    <title>Missile Command Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/missile-command-game/264854</link>
    <description>I had to write a 2d game for my Game Design class, so I decided to rip off my favorite atari game Missile Command:
http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=306

I tried to make it the same as the original, with the exception that I allow you to use the mouse for only 40% of the points you would normally make.  Here is a screenshot:

This program is cross-platform, written entirely in python and using panda3d for the game engine.  I made all the models/textures myself copying all of them except the missile trail off screenshots of the original missile command as played in stella.  All speed and scoring are set by constants up at the top of the program so they can be easily changed.  You can also uncomment the second line to have it fullscreen.

Tell me what you think of it, any comments are welcome.  Have fun.</description>
