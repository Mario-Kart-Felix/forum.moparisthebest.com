		Asylum is as much a client project as it is a server one. The client is based off of Galkons 474 look alike. All data with the exception of sprites is cache packed.

There are currently [b]two[/b] builds of the asylum client.

The first is:
474 gameframe, hiticons, autocasting like rs, 602 animations, items, npcs, gfx, and models. The objects are from the 508 revision. The only non 317 maps added are godwars and Warriors guild.

The second is the unstable build: 
This client is based on the last version made of the first client and contains the 474 gameframe, hiticons, autocasting like rs, 602 animations, 377 maps, 650 models, items, maps, npcs, animations, gfx, and objects cache packed.
The client also uses a modified version of the 317 on demand protocol, for file updating instead of the versionlist like 317, it uses a system more like the new engine cache format. The client does not use Jaggrab or the Http servers at all. 
[b]Note:[/b] Even though the data is cache packed, I have not yet done the headers to load the data for anything besides items.


The server is based off of riotscape. The server uses netty for networking, and features A* pathfinding. 
Many of the original flaws and problems with winterlove are completely redone and fixed including but not limited to:

Thread-per client. 
Updating.
Walking.
Excessive use of process().
The way packetbuilding/decoding was done.
Ton of un-needed variables related to players and Npc&#39;s. 
Additionally, A lot of the excessive instancing of pointless classes has been removed.

Changes made to riotscape before starting:
Removal of Grahams old event manager and the python scripting system. Removal of the object managing system. Implementation of javascript scripting. Implementation of the Tick system that I have been using for months based on the same theory as used by Tickables in google and by graham in his TaskManager he released.

The Server is comparable to the bastard son of hyperion with a winterlove *****. I&#39;ll be honest when I say that at least half of the original changes were made based on how hyperion has influenced my overall concept of server design. 

Code taken from hyperion, either by inspiration or just ripped: 
Location.java (ripped, and more methods later added on).
Some methods were used for Entity.java, others are self made.
The region system is based around the one from Hyperion, however, Regionmanager class uses a single array of Regions which is organized so that  it is numbered from right to left (and then up a row and then right to left and then... etc). 
PacketBuilder/ Packet java (before the netty switch).
Event Manager.
Original Update server.
Pathfinding (later modified by myself).

Media and Update Log 9/16/11 -&gt; Oldest.

Autocasting like current rs, or err sorta xD

Only custom i plan on adding (I cbf packing the dragon defender model atm).

I also added dicing, chaotic c bow, and a ton of equipment bonuses, and slot definitions.

(Need to do html color codes)

Last real bug that hindered gameplay was fixed. It dealt with chat.

Tormented demons are nearly finished, same for KBD. When i say finished, i mean perfect to the finest detail. For example, all animations, graphics, and timers are all accurate. All attacks have the correct effects.

Also, PC has undergone a total overhaul. It literally just needs a few more tweaks and its perfect.
Currently it has:
Splatters working and destroying walls / doors like rs.
Brawlers doing their job
Torchers and Defilers behaving like rs
Spinners will heal the closest portal.

Also, started working on dynamic shops that will sell equipment that you can use.
Example, with 40 attack 1 defence, the shop will show rune weapons and all iron armor.

              <p>I have a test Wednesday, so I didn’t get much done yesterday. All I did was absentmindedly redo the spec system. Specs are now loaded into a map, and mapped to their item id’s. I also modded the system so that special effects are much easier to add for myself &lt;3. Plan on tweaking ranged heavily tomorrow. I just want to redo the system and make it more useable.</p>

              <p>Update: 11/11/11 will be the hypothetical day for alpha testing. I have spent the last bit working on client some more and more specifically the update server (client and server sided). I have pretty much fully refactored the 317 system, and I have working server sided for an un modded 317 client. However, mine doesnt fit that category, so I have had to make the following changes, and I will probably just rewrite the client and server sided so it better suits my purposes.</p>
<p>Changes made<br>
Previously the system had requests made and sent with.<br>
Cache index - 1; so index 1(models) was sent as 0. Since I use the update server for sending the initial game files, I modified it so index  0 (configs in 317) is 0, and index 1 is 1, etc. Additionally, I added a byte to the server sided to determine file compression since the files in index0 use bzip2 compression, whereas the other files use gzip. I plan on also modding the protocol so that files are sent in once at the whole time rather than in chunks, this is debatable though, I havn’t decided completely yet. Also, the priorities for the cache requests have been changed.<br>
Before, there were 3 priorities which were based around whether the client was logged in, and other stuff. This has been changed so that certain indexes are prioritized client sided, with whether the client is logged in also playing an role in the value sent.</p>
<p>Server sided, the update server is simplistic, and uses the same opcodes as before. Currently, requests are added to a PriorityBlockingQueue, where the comparator compares the values by their priority. I use a threadpool to service the requests in this queue.</p>
<p>Credits for my progress in the above:<br>
Graham Edgecombe (maker of hyperion, providing the structure of the initial packet response, and the packet sent) which was crucial in refactoring the client sided, and also is being used.<br>
Myself, being a sexy boss.<br>
Method and Tom for their topics on the update server protocol server and client sided.</p>

<p><span class="mention">@Topic</span>. Repacked cache, removed 602 models, just 634 in the cache now. Cache size is like 250 mb atm (cutting it down as I go, should be like 130 when I’m done, but I have an update server so the initial download won’t be bad for you all).</p>

<p>Always was interested in your sig on R-S, was wondering what you were working on. &gt;.&lt;[/quote]<br>
Yeah, its been awhile. Who are you there, I might know you.</p>
<p>Didn’t do a ton yesterday after I added the Html color codes.</p>
<p>All I did was add artifacts as a 5% chance of drop when in the wilderness. Hoping it will help stimulate the eco abit early on and get some gold into the economy.</p>
<p>Also, Barrows breaks on death. Corrupt items (dragon, and pvp gear) is destroyed on death. Currently non corrupt items pvp gear (non-corrupt) are also destroyed on death.<br>
Hoping that with something like this in place these items will hold greater value. (Except for corrupt dragon which was added just to have it).</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Spent the last bit working on maps. I changed a few of the server -&gt; client packets and also how the client handles them. XTEA keys are now sent with that packet. I also made it load the new maps for abit, work fine. Just need flo and objects now and they’l be good.<br>

<pre><code>	Asylum is as much a client project as it is a server one. The client is based off of Galkons 474 look alike. All data with the exception of sprites is cache packed.
</code></pre>
<p>There are currently <span class="bbcode-b">two</span> builds of the asylum client.</p>
<p>The first is:<br>
474 gameframe, hiticons, autocasting like rs, 602 animations, items, npcs, gfx, and models. The objects are from the 508 revision. The only non 317 maps added are godwars and Warriors guild.</p>
<p>The second is the unstable build:<br>
This client is based on the last version made of the first client and contains the 474 gameframe, hiticons, autocasting like rs, 602 animations, 377 maps, 650 models, items, maps, npcs, animations, gfx, and objects cache packed.<br>
The client also uses a modified version of the 317 on demand protocol, for file updating instead of the versionlist like 317, it uses a system more like the new engine cache format. The client does not use Jaggrab or the Http servers at all.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Note:</span> Even though the data is cache packed, I have not yet done the headers to load the data for anything besides items.</p>
<p>The server is based off of riotscape. The server uses netty for networking, and features A* pathfinding.<br>
Many of the original flaws and problems with winterlove are completely redone and fixed including but not limited to:</p>
<p>Thread-per client.<br>
Updating.<br>
Walking.<br>
Excessive use of process().<br>
The way packetbuilding/decoding was done.<br>
Ton of un-needed variables related to players and Npc’s.<br>
Additionally, A lot of the excessive instancing of pointless classes has been removed.</p>
<p>Changes made to riotscape before starting:<br>
Removal of Grahams old event manager and the python scripting system. Removal of the object managing system. Implementation of javascript scripting. Implementation of the Tick system that I have been using for months based on the same theory as used by Tickables in google and by graham in his TaskManager he released.</p>
<p>The Server is comparable to the bastard son of hyperion with a winterlove *****. I’ll be honest when I say that at least half of the original changes were made based on how hyperion has influenced my overall concept of server design.</p>
<p>Code taken from hyperion, either by inspiration or just ripped:<br>
Location.java (ripped, and more methods later added on).<br>
Some methods were used for Entity.java, others are self made.<br>
The region system is based around the one from Hyperion, however, Regionmanager class uses a single array of Regions which is organized so that  it is numbered from right to left (and then up a row and then right to left and then… etc).<br>
PacketBuilder/ Packet java (before the netty switch).<br>
Event Manager.<br>
Original Update server.<br>
Pathfinding (later modified by myself).</p>
<p>Media and Update Log 9/16/11 -&gt; Oldest.</p>
<p>Another picture (with the menus updated a tad, it looks better imho)<br>
<img src="http://img36.imageshack.us/img36/1041/autocasting.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Autocasting like current rs, or err sorta xD<br>
<img src="http://img718.imageshack.us/img718/6500/autocast.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Also added same hotkeys as rs.</p>
<p><img src="http://img90.imageshack.us/img90/9958/asylumpic.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
hit 9 testers.</p>
<p><img src="http://k.minus.com/jbzcDYgTAedu2m.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Only custom i plan on adding (I cbf packing the dragon defender model atm).<br>
<img src="http://k.minus.com/jHjBiP1xQbJ8i.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I also added dicing, chaotic c bow, and a ton of equipment bonuses, and slot definitions.</p>
<p>(Need to do html color codes)<br>
<img src="http://k.minus.com/j2Z7HytXe6aFu.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Last real bug that hindered gameplay was fixed. It dealt with chat.</p>
<p>Tormented demons are nearly finished, same for KBD. When i say finished, i mean perfect to the finest detail. For example, all animations, graphics, and timers are all accurate. All attacks have the correct effects.</p>
<p>Also, PC has undergone a total overhaul. It literally just needs a few more tweaks and its perfect.<br>
Currently it has:<br>
Splatters working and destroying walls / doors like rs.<br>
Brawlers doing their job<br>
Torchers and Defilers behaving like rs<br>
Spinners will heal the closest portal.</p>
<p>Also, started working on dynamic shops that will sell equipment that you can use.<br>
Example, with 40 attack 1 defence, the shop will show rune weapons and all iron armor.</p>
<p>Ags Special Attack<br>
<img src="http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/9958/asylumpic.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
D2h Special Attack<br>
<img src="http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/8894/asylumd2h.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Strength Skillcape Emote (all are added)<br>

<p>(Just did some spelling fixes )</p>
