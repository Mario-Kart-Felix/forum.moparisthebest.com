    <description>a friend of mine was banned because he griefed, but that&#39;s not the important part.
he built some parts of my house, and left me some items, the parts he built, are gone, and the items in the chests are now &quot;undefined items&quot;, i tried taking the items but my game crushes and i have to relog, after i relog several times, i still get a black screen.
can some admin remove my items from inv, and get rid of the others placed in chests?
i want to play D:</description>
