[center][u][b][size=14pt]Welcome to the Development Team Recruitment page for The Inglorious Fate![/size][/b][/u]
[br]
[center][img]http://img600.imageshack.us/img600/4747/approvalsmall.jpg[/img][/center]

~Info~
Game Name: [b]The Inglorious Fate[/b]
Web Site: [b]http://ingloriousfate.99k.org/[/b]
Cache Revision: [b]614[/b]
Server and Client Originally from [b]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=452322.0[/b][/center]


Let me start off with the obvious. First, this server is nowhere near being perfect. Second, this server is not here to make me or anyone else money. And third, with enough help, this server could be incredible. At the moment, we have a web site (the URL is above) with a section about how you can download our client and cache. Please click on the &quot;Downloads&quot; section on the top of the website and follow the directions to acquire your version of The Inglorious Fate. But first, let me explain to you what this server is all about.

The Inglorious Fate is a RuneScape private server project based upon some of the basic concepts of RuneScape while also introducing new themes in order to create a familiar yet original environment. Yes, the server is quite empty at the moment, but it also has one advantage: it uses 614 cache, which is one of the newest revisions to date. And what&#39;s the ultimate goal, you might ask? It&#39;s too far-fetched to even think about right now, but the goal is quite simple: to completely reinvent the RuneScape world as we all know it. Sure, this accomplishment is months away from full completion; but if it were to be completed, the world of private servers would be forever changed. So, lo and behold, here is The Inglorious Fate!

Accepted, welcome aboard  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Also, I’m going to need your email… I forgot to ask that on the application. If you’d rather just use this PM system, I’m cool with that. An email would help though. And yeah, Activision published Call of Duty: Black Ops.  :eek:</p>

I agree with you about the instability of the server, but having a few programmers to help me make it perfect isn’t too much to ask for, is it? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Let me start off with the obvious. First, this server is nowhere near being perfect. Second, this server is not here to make me or anyone else money. And third, with enough help, this server could be incredible. At the moment, we have a web site (the URL is above) with a section about how you can download our client and cache. Please click on the “Downloads” section on the top of the website and follow the directions to acquire your version of The Inglorious Fate. But first, let me explain to you what this server is all about.</p>
<p>The Inglorious Fate is a RuneScape private server project based upon some of the basic concepts of RuneScape while also introducing new themes in order to create a familiar yet original environment. Yes, the server is quite empty at the moment, but it also has one advantage: it uses 614 cache, which is one of the newest revisions to date. And what’s the ultimate goal, you might ask? It’s too far-fetched to even think about right now, but the goal is quite simple: to completely reinvent the RuneScape world as we all know it. Sure, this accomplishment is months away from full completion; but if it were to be completed, the world of private servers would be forever changed. So, lo and behold, here is The Inglorious Fate!</p>
