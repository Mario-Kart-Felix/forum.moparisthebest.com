    <description>Ok, I have 2 ideas for my server but the problem is I would have no idea how to do them. The first idea is setting your hotkeys. Like, in the quest tab below the other stuff there could be somewhere where the player could set like to go to inventory hit f6 to mage book f7 to prayer book f5 and all that. I have no idea how to do this and if anyone could help that would be great. The next idea is in the songs tab it would be cool if I put like real songs in there that actually work. So the players could click on a song and it would play. If anyone knows how to do this, if you could help that would be cool. Also post back your opinions on these ideas.</description>
