    <title>Bad death issue 317 Delta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bad-death-issue-317-delta/392850</link>
    <description>Hello, currently when a player dies from anything (including NPC&#39;s) They are awarded 5 PK points. I think this may only be for normal players (Not admins or owners). Also if a player in the same room as you dies from a npc that you are also attacking, you are awarded PKP and it says &quot;You have killed ...&quot;. This was tested on Bandos. This is real bad for my server and I have no idea what to look for in order to fix this..

This was the only code I could find involving + 5 PKP
[code]		}
		if (!IsInFightCave() &amp;&amp; !isInPitGame() &amp;&amp; !isInPitRoom() &amp;&amp; playerRights != 2 &amp;&amp; playerRights != 3 &amp;&amp; action != 1 &amp;&amp; deathStage == 2 &amp;&amp;  System.currentTimeMillis() - deathTimer &gt;= 2500) {
		client killerz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[KillerId];
		youdied();
		killerz.rating += 15;
		killerz.sM(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+playerName+&quot;.&quot;);
		killerz.pkPoints += 5;

          <blockquote>
              <p>You aren’t doing it properly, half the tutorials for adding pk points are wrong.</p>
<p>When you die by a npc it checks the second if-then statement also; for someone who lacks Java it looks a bit confusing, but look for this:</p>
<p>‘client killerz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[<span class="bbcode-b">KillerId</span>];’ The reason I bolded KillerId is because if you look up where the variable KillerId is declared it looks like this:</p>
<p>‘public int KillerId = playerId;’ Which means that killerz is essentially yourself (Since you are being attacked be an NPC).</p>
<p>So basically your saying whenever an NPC Kills you or you kill someone, you will gain rating and pk points.</p>
<p>If you actually read what I said you should know how to fix it, add a simple check before giving the points.</p>
