<p>I assume it’s a full-screen game with the cursor/crosshairs firmly planted in the center of the screen?  I’m not exactly sure how that would work, because they usually have a wider variety of colors, more anti-aliasing (which creates colors that shouldn’t be there), and a mouse that can’t simply move to an x/y coordinate.</p>
