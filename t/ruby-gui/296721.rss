    <title>Ruby GUI</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ruby-gui/296721</link>
    <description>So, I know a [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,108628.0.html]lot[/url] of [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,192367.0.html]people[/url] have talked about it already, but I recently decided to try my hand at ruby as well. I wanted to see if anyone else was still coding in ruby and wouldn&#39;t mind giving me some hints/tips.

Right now I&#39;m trying to create an automated browser to play NeoQuest with Ruby and am trying to use the [url=http://rubyforge.org/projects/mechanize/]WWW::Mechanize gem[/url] but am having problems just running their examples. Has anyone else had success with this?

Edit: I&#39;ve skipped figuring out the example and have been able to use other examples to figure out what I need from the gem. Anyone have GUI Experience though? Could use so help with it :)

Thanks,
Mike

Edit: Not sure what&#39;s wrong with this example, but I&#39;ve gotten Mechanize to work for me.
Code I&#39;m playing with comes from the Examples.rdoc File Upload to Flickr:
I&#39;ve tweaked it a little to try and address the problem, but still no go. See [url=http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=26976&amp;group_id=1453&amp;atid=5709]my bug report[/url] for more info.
[code]#!/usr/bin/ruby
require &#39;rubygems&#39;
require &#39;mechanize&#39;

a = WWW::Mechanize.new { |agent|
    # Flickr refreshes after login
    agent.follow_meta_refresh = true
  }

a.get(&#39;http://flickr.com/&#39;) do |home_page|
    puts home_page
    puts home_page.respond_to?(&quot;links&quot;)

    # Original faulty code
    # signin_page = a.click(home_page.links.text(/Sign In/))
    # puts signin_page

    home_page.links.each do |link|
      puts &quot;#{link.to_s}&quot;
      if link.to_s.include?(&#39;Sign In&#39;)
        puts &quot;Found the Sign In Link!&quot;
        
        # My ruby interpreter hangs here
        signin_page = link.click
        puts &quot;Don&#39;t reach here&quot;
      end
    end
end[/code]
[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 21, 2009, 08:23:26 pm[/size][hr]Ugh. So I&#39;ve met my match. Apparently, the neoquest game utilizes java script commands that I don&#39;t fully understand, but it&#39;s limiting me. So I&#39;m planning on closing the lid on the ruby experience and moving to creating a browser and/or add on to do this. To be continued in other thread.</description>
