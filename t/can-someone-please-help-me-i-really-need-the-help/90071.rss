    <description>This is the &quot;Ultimate Server Guide&quot; step i am having trouble with :
______________________________________________________________________________________________

Now we will need to make the rule for your router, by doing this you need to go into your router. You can do this by going into Internet Explorer (or whatever client you use for the Internet), and then type in the IP address of the router. Now log into the router and go into &quot;advanced&quot; (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the &quot;gaming&quot; button (is only left side for me...) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information:

Name: 1
IP address: 2
TCP Ports to open: 43594
UDP Ports to open:
Inbound Filter: Allow All
Schedule: Always

_____________________________________________________________________________________________

Now i put in my IP adress, and i try to go into the advanced option, but i dont see the &quot;Gaming&quot; option , and i cant find that form, can someone help me?</description>
