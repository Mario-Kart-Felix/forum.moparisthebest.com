Now we will need to make the rule for your router, by doing this you need to go into your router. You can do this by going into Internet Explorer (or whatever client you use for the Internet), and then type in the IP address of the router. Now log into the router and go into &quot;advanced&quot; (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the &quot;gaming&quot; button (is only left side for me...) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information:

Name: 1
IP address: 2
TCP Ports to open: 43594
UDP Ports to open:
Inbound Filter: Allow All
Schedule: Always
