    <title>Ford Extended Warranty</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ford-extended-warranty/404662</link>
    <description>My father bought a Ford F250 Super Duty last month since our 2000 Ford 250 quit while hauling our trailer back from our campground. We broke 3 coils and the truck was working so hard we we&#39;re going 30/kph and the A/C cut out. The trailer weighs a bit over 6000 pounds and isn&#39;t a fifth wheel. Anyway, as I was saying. We we&#39;re offered the Ford Extended Warranty at the dealership of course and it cost a bit over 1900$. We declined the offer, and decided to look online. We&#39;d found a couple people talking about someone in Greenfield, Massachusetts. I won&#39;t say any names but my dad got talking and decided to buy the EXACT warranty offered at the dealership for 1200$. He sends 1000$ to ford and keeps 200$ himself, takes your VIN and adds it to the system. Wollah! 3 days later we&#39;d checked at the local dealership, it was on there.

TL;DR: Don&#39;t buy the extended warranty for your new cars until you look for alternatives.
If anyone&#39;s had the same experience, post below.
Discuss.
Oh and before you all get up in my grill (hah, car jokes) I didn&#39;t choose the truck, my dad did.</description>
