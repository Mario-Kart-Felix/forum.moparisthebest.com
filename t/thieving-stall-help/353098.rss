    <description>  Using 317 server, Not Delta!

  Hey guys I&#39;m trying to figure out how to get it so that when I right click on a stall that I put in my server it gives the option to steal from it, and once you do that you get money from it + xp. I have no idea where to put this code, I think it&#39;s right, you can check for me. I&#39;ve tried putting it under where I got the code, yes, I understand how brackets work. Once I compile it I get the 100 errors. So if you could help me out by telling me even if this code is right, and second of all where the hell to put it in the client.java?

[code=javascript]public int theifTimer = 3;

public void TheifStall(Bakery Stall,&quot;You recieve 5k.&quot;,1,250,617,5000,30,0x340) {

if(theifTimer == 3) {
 if(playerLevel[17] &gt;= 1) {
   setAnimation(881);
   sendMessage(&quot;You steal from the &quot;+stallName);
   sendMessage(&quot;You recieve 5k);
   addItem(617,5000);
   addSkillXP(250, 17);
   theifTimer = 3;
  }
  else if(playerLevel[17] &lt; 1) {
  sendMessage(&quot;You need a theiving level of &quot;+lvlReq+&quot; to theif from this stall.&quot;);[/code]</description>
