    <description>4A-GE 16V Bluetop Burning Oil

Suddenly, in the last few days, my car has started to burn oil. And from the exhaust it looks pretty bad. The car still seems to have full power though. Does anyone know what could be happening that is causing the motor to burn oil?


EDIT: I am starting to think it might be a broken head gasket. I will check the water level tomorrow morning.</description>

              <p>I just drove it into town and it seems to be running alright without any smoke. However, I was thinking it might have just been because it was really cold the last few days that the exhaust gasses just got more dense than normal and I was paying attention to it, same could go for the oil maybe? (It is winter here, been having a few cold frosts over the last few days).</p>

              <p>As I said, blue smoke means it’s burning oil, which can be any of an entire list of reasons causing it.  White smoke means it’s burning water, which means you have a blown head gasket.  Depending on how/where it is blown, you could be losing oil too.  Regardless you are going to have to fix it, and, unless you do it yourself, it isn’t going to be cheap.</p>

Oil level: Dropped 1cm on dip stick over last 2 days</p>
<p>Last night, I left my car outside, idling for like 5 mins (engine was warm after that) while I was getting something from the house. When I got outside, there was basically nothing but white smoke around the car. And as I was reversing away, a line of new smoke was just following me.</p>

<p>From what it looks like, I don’t think it is even really burning any much oil. But the water level has dropped rapidly and last night I left the car running for 5 mins and I could barely find it behind all the white smoke.</p>

</aside>
<p>When a car burns oil it will put out BLUE smoke, WHITE smoke means you are burning water or anti-freeze.  A little is alright when you start it because it is generally just some condensation, but if your water level dropped and steady white smoke is coming out only one thing is possible.  You have a blown head gasket.</p>

              <p>It could be the head gasket as you said, check the water for oil and vice-versa.  But it is also probably bad valve seals, it’s not really that big of a deal if it’s not burning a lot of oil (check it regularly though, like once a day).  If you want it to stop smoking, like if you are going to sell it or something, you could change the oil to full synthetic, because it doesn’t smoke. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:">  (but it’s much more expensive, so you don’t want to run it if it’s burning oil)</p>

<blockquote>Best Answer - Chosen by Voters
Cam, rod or main bearings have absolutely no "bearing" on why your motor uses oil. If the bearings were bad the crankshaft would be laying in your driveway or a connecting rod would be a new part sticking through the side of your block.
<p>If the motor has no visible external leaks, the only other possibilities are worn piston rings, plugged up oil rings, worn cylinder bores or worn valve guides. The areas I’ve listed allow excess crankcase oil to enter the combustion chamber to be burned.</p>
<p>Causes are directly related to a forgetful oil change maintenance schedule or an engine with a thermostat stuck open. What kind of oil do you use? What viscosity is it? How often do you have it changed? Does your heater kick out high temperature heat once the motor has warmed up?<br>
