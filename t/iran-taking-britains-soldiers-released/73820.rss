    <title>Iran taking Britain&#39;s soldiers - Released</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/iran-taking-britains-soldiers-released/73820</link>
    <description>I figured someone would make a topic about this already...

In case you&#39;ve been hiding under your rock for the last two weeks, Iran kidnapped 15 British soldiers off a boat. Britain still hasn&#39;t done anything about it, and are now pissed because they let some video out of them doing it.

Discuss what you think Britain should do, and why they haven&#39;t done it already

[i]Edit: Iran released the soldiers today. Yesterday they were in jump suits, today there in black tux..

<p>That is extremely wrong, for hundreds of reasons, and I have no idea why you would even suggest that.<br>
I really hope that was sarcastic or a dumb quickly typed, stupid comment.</p>
<p>[quote=“LegendaryLoser, post:5, topic:73820”]I would say just wait, because if Iran actually killed the soldiers I believe Britain would go into war with them, or not, it all depends.</p>
<p>//off topic- My cat busted my eye lid a minute ago… that cute little f**ker…[/quote]<br>
There is no way in hell Iran would kill them, that is the stereotypical western point of view, that all of the middle east is terrorists, and just because Iran captures soldiers(which they have every right to do because Britian were trespassing into their waters) you think that they are going to kill them.<br>
Wow.</p>
