    <title>I found 3 debit cards today....?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-found-3-debit-cards-today/543478</link>
    <description>Hey. So as the title says, I found 3 debit cards today. I was going down the sidewalk when I found the first one... And I just stopped waiting for all the cars to go bye, pretending to text someone so I didn&#39;t look too suspicious. After all the cars went by, I started looking around for bums. Yes. Bums. I was in an area where homeless people tend to stake out. I didn&#39;t want to be interested in a &quot;turkey drop&quot;.... After making sure there was nobody around I picked it up. Then I notice there are 2 more debits cards about 5 feet away. I pick those two up... They&#39;ve got the same last name. I go to a marketplace, and sit down, pull out my phone and go to craigslist, checking the lost and found section. I seen nothing, so I didnt do anything, besides put the cards and my phone into my pocket. This was about 8:15 in the morning when I found the cards. About 5:45 I went threw the same place as I found the cards, and they weren&#39;t there in the early morning. 

What should I do with these cards?
What would you do with them?

Do I:
Call the banks and report the cards found?
Hope I find the rightful owners and return them, hoping for a reward?
Be a greedy P.O.S. and try using them to buy $100 in snickers? ;)
lemme know</description>

<p>Maybe if you read these two comments with less seriousness, you’d realize these two posts weren’t serious.</p>
<p>Also just throwing this out, a lot of stores these days have a limit at which you don’t even need to sign or put the pin in. At walmart and sams club you don’t have to sign or put your pin in if the transaction is under $50.</p>

I’m guessing you’ve never had a debit card. They probably don’t even work now. Just throw it away.</p>
<p>If they do work because the owner didn’t report it lost and you really want to spend money from it, buy rsgp through a proxy. That way you can get your money back by selling the gold.[/quote]<br>
^ Kinda yeah this. Usually the owners will cancel, but I’d call just in case.</p>
