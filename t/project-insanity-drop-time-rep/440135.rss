    <title>[Project Insanity] Drop Time (Rep++)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-drop-time-rep/440135</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve added a PK reward system successfully to my RSPS, but I have a slight issue. When the money is dropped, the player that killed the other cannot view the money reward for killing that player, but the player that has died can run back and view the money after it has been dropped. Is there a way so that I can make it show up instantly? Here&#39;s my method...

[code]if (c.killerId != c.playerId)
					o.sendMessage(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+Misc.optimizeText(c.playerName)+&quot;!&quot;);
					o.sendMessage(&quot;You receive 10,000GP for defeating your opponent.&quot;);
					c.playerKilled = c.playerId;
					Server.itemHandler.createGroundItem(c, 995, c.absX, c.absY, 10000, c.playerId);
				if(!PlayerKilling.hostOnList(o, c.connectedFrom)) {
					PlayerKilling.addHostToList(o, c.connectedFrom);
					o.pkPoints++;	
					}[/code]

Rep++ for all help...

Thanks,

              <p>I’m assuming that <span class="bbcode-i">o </span>represents the killer and<span class="bbcode-i"> c</span> is the victim. In that case, for the item spawning method you should make it use the killer rather than the victim. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>I’m not entirely familiar with PIs, so I could be wrong.</p>
