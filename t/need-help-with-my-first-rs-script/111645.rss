    <title>Need help with my first rs script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-first-rs-script/111645</link>
    <description>An auto fire maker that somebody requested.  I took my time on everything except for the actually banking and lighting of the logs, which I rushed through today.  It&#39;s technically my first runescape script (unless you count auto clickers and droppers etc.)

anyways, when I log in, my person starts lighting logs, even though it hasn&#39;t gone to the bank and withdrew anything yet.  If you can figure out what isn&#39;t right with this, please feel free to fix it and notify me of errors.
At least it compiles.</description>

Needs to be this:</p>
<p><code>Procedure ClickmyTinderbox;
begin
  If(FindDTM(mytinderbox,x,y,MIX1,MIY1,MIX2,MIY2))then
  begin
     wait(100)

     GoOpenBank;
     WithdrawTinderbox;

              <p>Well a few things I notice</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You tell it to GoOpenBank at the beginning of every different logs burning procedure.  You also tell it to do that in the main loop before lighting the logs, so wont that mean it does it twice?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could the reason it wont open the bank be that you say “if(Findbank(‘feb’)) then”.  If it doesn’t find the bank on it’s first try then it wont do it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
