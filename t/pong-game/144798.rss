    <title>Pong Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pong-game/144798</link>
    <description>This was my first real experience with Java 2D graphics (mainly Graphics2D), and I wanted to make something simple - like the first arcade game ever made.

The ball bouncing off objects is pretty buggy, since I wrote the entire game without a computer (my sketch was pretty messy). The main bug is that two people can&#39;t be pressing their buttons at the same time, ie only one key at a time. Is there any way to fix this? (there must be -.-)

The keys are &quot;Up, Down&quot; for player 2, and &quot;W, S&quot; for player 1 (iirc).

I deem myself Java cup worthy :D (joke, joke)

EDIT: The ball [u]is[/u] supposed to be extremely slow at first [if(p.score%2 == 0) ball.speed++;]
EDIT2: I just realized the paddles can go up/down off the screen &gt;&gt; Oh well, you can fix that :P</description>

              <p>Multilayer would be nice… Just make sure to make the protocol TCP (lossless) and the clients synchronize, like one client sends the trajectory, before moving the ball it has to wait for the other client to reply “got it!” That way you bypass the advantage having a T1 instead of DSL would provide.</p>
