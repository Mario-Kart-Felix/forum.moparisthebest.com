    <title>[508] How to play music?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-how-to-play-music/237414</link>
    <description>Well I recently decided to try setup my own 508 server and i was happy to see sounds worked , so did music on the main menu, i was wondering if there is anyway for me to get more runescape music in game or my own music at least?
Also if there is a way can someone tell me how :D?
Thanks in advance</description>

              <p>by library you mean dll right?<br>
Anyway what i mean is maybe like any wav music or something (though wav files are quite large I think).<br>
Sorry if this is a really nubby question <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

              <p>[quote=“Nuke207, post:5, topic:237414”]the music could be change-able<br>
like theres  a music folder and any of some music format in it get detected and played<br>
since I’m not a 1337 coder i really have no idea how to do that :([/quote]<br>
I don’t think there’s one Java library which will play all forms of audio files, which means for each file type you will need a new library.</p>

              <p>I’m not a fan of the inbuilt music players, all they add is file size. Almost everyone here has an audio player, probably 99% of them is iTunes. I have Amarok, but it all works the same. I don’t see why you need them, seeing as most likely the developer of that client likes different music to you.</p>
