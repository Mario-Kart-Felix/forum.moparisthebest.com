    <title>Buying a full server client package</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buying-a-full-server-client-package/431545</link>
    <description>I will pay good money for a full RSC server/ client package.
I want skills and quests as well as a working sprite, model and terrain editor.
I also need help getting my custom GUI graphics and stuff added.
I also want some help getting it all set up.
I already have dedicated server hosting and can easily set up multi tier ddos protection. I mainly just want this as a personal project and if I release any clients it will be on invitation only.

PM me if anyone is interested.</description>

              <p>You don’t need to pay money.<br>
Use moparclassic source… get it from github.<br>
Search for the landscape and sprite editor. Model editors are not publicly available.<br>
Learn Java to do it yourself.<br>
You don’t need ddos protection if its only for a few people.</p>
