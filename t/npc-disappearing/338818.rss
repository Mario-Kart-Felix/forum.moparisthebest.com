    <title>NPC disappearing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-disappearing/338818</link>
    <description>I was just making a mini-mini-mini-game and got it almost working, there is still a thing I wanna fix, that if you die or escape the scene(easiest done by a boolean telling if they are in the specified spot, which I got) the boss npc will disappear and that&#39;s how it manages to get always a full heal after someone forfeiting!


EDIT: lolz this was too easy... sorry... Got it solved</description>
