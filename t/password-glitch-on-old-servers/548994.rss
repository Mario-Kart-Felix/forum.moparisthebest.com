    <title>Password glitch on old servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/password-glitch-on-old-servers/548994</link>
    <description>Back in around 2006 or so I hosted a small server and basicly everytime someone logged in it would say there username and an encrypted password but every so often it would rarely glitch, I have no idea how but it would show passwords unencrypted.

Sure enough I tried logging in to real runescape with the few passwords I saw before it fixed itself
And luckily for me someone cleverly used there own runeacape account name and password to log in to my server.  I got full rune and a couple hundred k or so nothing too good but I just thought it was funny. 

But I&#39;m afraid this story takes a darker turn as when I got onto the account i was excited and changed the password thinking maybe I could use it or something, a couple days later I started feeling bad and had no need for the account and I didn&#39;t really need the items so I was gonna put them back on it but by then i couldn&#39;t remember what I changed the password to and It had no recoveries. Lord knows I felt bad. This guy checking out my own server and I stabbed him in the back. 

I just had to clear my conscious haha.

Did this password glitch ever happen to anybody else?</description>
