    <title>Reporting Moderator Warnings</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reporting-moderator-warnings/207696</link>
    <description>Lately various people have been reporting moderators that have warned them, saying that they have not breached the rules in any way; that the warning is unjust, and therefore needs to be removed (note that Niall has also made a topic about this).

Long story short, as Niall has stated in his topic, the warnings were accurate.

From now on, if you receive a warning we do not recommend reporting it. 
[b]If you report a warning to us, the forum&#39;s administrators, and we see it as a fair decision on the moderator&#39;s part, we will mute you.[/b]

This is just one example:

This picture shows a member that has been warned - he decided it would be intelligent to report a completely valid moderator action. As the picture clearly shows, I have, in turn, muted the user.
This user also decided to make a topic to verbally attack the moderator and has now been banned for doing so.

If you enjoy using this forum then I suggest that you read the rules, otherwise you will also end up muted or banned.</description>
