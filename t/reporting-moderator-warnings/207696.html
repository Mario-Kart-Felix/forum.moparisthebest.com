        <p>Lately various people have been reporting moderators that have warned them, saying that they have not breached the rules in any way; that the warning is unjust, and therefore needs to be removed (note that Niall has also made a topic about this).</p>
<p>Long story short, as Niall has stated in his topic, the warnings were accurate.</p>
<p>From now on, if you receive a warning we do not recommend reporting it.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">If you report a warning to us, the forum’s administrators, and we see it as a fair decision on the moderator’s part, we will mute you.</span></p>
<p>This is just one example:<br>
<img src="http://img150.imageshack.us/img150/9914/moronss6.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
This picture shows a member that has been warned - he decided it would be intelligent to report a completely valid moderator action. As the picture clearly shows, I have, in turn, muted the user.<br>
This user also decided to make a topic to verbally attack the moderator and has now been banned for doing so.</p>
<p>If you enjoy using this forum then I suggest that you read the rules, otherwise you will also end up muted or banned.</p>
