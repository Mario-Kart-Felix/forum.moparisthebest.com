    <title>Changing exp rates on a 508 server. Not adverage problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-exp-rates-on-a-508-server-not-adverage-problem/296172</link>
    <description>Hey, I know this is asked a lot and I&#39;ve tried to follow tuts on how to do it. It&#39;s simple and just not working for me! 

In my PlayerNPCCombat.java or PlayerCombat.java there is nothing that I can find to change how much exp you get.

In my server right now when you click the hay bale or door you get exp. I need to take that out. I&#39;m thinking that the person who first designed this deleted the spots where you get exp from killing because my char doesn&#39;t get any exp when attacking a npc. So how would I go about putting it back into my scripts?</description>
