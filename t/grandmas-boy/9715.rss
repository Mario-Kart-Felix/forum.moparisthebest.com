    <title>Grandma&#39;s Boy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/grandmas-boy/9715</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded and watched. 
Its about a 36 year old video game tester, who is kicked out of his house and forced to live with his grandma and her two roommates. Although the majority of the film is about work. Suprisingly funny, althought the plot lackes a bit, the acting and comedy more then make up for it. Joel Moore&#39;s acting was great (J.P. in the movie). Its a happy madison production and so far everything I&#39;ve seen from them has been great. Anyway If you havn&#39;t seen it, I suggest you watch it asap.  :) I give it a 9/10.</description>
