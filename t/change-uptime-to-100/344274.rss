    <description>Could you change my servers uptime to 100%? (RuneMyth)
- Because its always online, but suddenly it got down to 99% while it was actually on
- Or make the system better that it better recognizes if the server is online/offline

[b]Im experiencing this many times that it says offline while the server is just online!![/b]
