    <title>Few questions about woodcutting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions-about-woodcutting/181925</link>
    <description>1) How do I make the tree respawn pretty fast after it falls because right now it is not respawning after it falls?

2) How can I make the exp longer to level?

3) how can i change the look of the stump after it falls because for a regular tree when it falls there is a big ugly stump lol, I would like to change it to something smaller and looks like it belongs to the tree that fell.

If you can answer any of the three that would be awsome thanks.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 16, 2008, 12:57:55 PM[/size][hr]I fixed #3 myself.</description>
