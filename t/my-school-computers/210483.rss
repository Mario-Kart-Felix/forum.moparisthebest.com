    <description>Well i never really thought of it until today. But why the hell does everyone have so strict of usage on computers except my school. I mean to get on any site i want to simply run cmd ping whatever.com enter ip into address bar. So why the fuck are schools so strict if some of them are so retarded?</description>

              <p>Our school <span class="bbcode-i">was</span> pretty unrestricted. Everyone knew the common way to get around the school filters using firefox… Until a couple of people hacked the Administrator password of the computers in the school and shut down a whole room of computers (I wasn’t included, honest ;)). Now they have <span class="bbcode-i">started</span> blocking stuff and running monitoring software on us. We can no longer use Task Manager (nothing that Process Explorer won’t fix), and it probably won’t take them long to restrict more stuff.</p>
<p>I think that the strictness of most schools probably depends on the intelligence of the computer staff. For instance, we recently got a new IT person and they implemented all the blocks and shit…</p>

My school has about 7 technicians in everyday. We can’t run cmd or even make one. no way round<br>
[/quote]<br>
Steal a school computer, hax0r it, find out all the passwords and then plug a laptop into the network. At my school every username and password is stored on each computer and downloaded on startup. We just can’t access them because of rights and stuff.[/quote]<br>
I can easily crack the passwords on my school.<br>
I know all username and know that all password has 5 letters/number in it and i can reach the server from my own Laptop, just need a program.</p>
<p>But I don’t think that is a good idea, I don’t earn anything on it and not good if anyone see it.</p>

Well i never really thought of it until today. But why the hell does everyone have so strict of usage on computers except my school. I mean to get on any site i want to simply run cmd ping <a href="http://whatever.com" rel="nofollow noopener">whatever.com</a> enter ip into address bar. So why the fuck are schools so strict if some of them are so retarded?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Wow, If we could use the command line I’d be doing much more than pinging.[/quote]<br>
Umm well i would to except for the fact that I have someone staring at my screen while im doing it. And if I get caught on anything eg <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow noopener">youtube.com</a> I will be suspended.</p>

<p>i installed kubuntu linux on a machine there, and it has no sites blocked, and you can install anything you want on it, and you can go on msn and irc (no ports are blocked) and practically do anything the other windows machines can do.</p>
<p>one thing it doesnt have is where you login on your school account, there is just one user account and iv written its username and password on the monitor so everyone can use it, its quite popular <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
