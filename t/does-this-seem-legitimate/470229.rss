              <p>motherboard: any one that will fit your cpu socket with the features to need, if you want more sata connectors you’ll want a more expensive harddrive and if you don’t want built in (terrible quality) wifi you can get a cheap mobo</p>
<p>same for hdd, buy the biggest cheapest one you can from a good manufacturer and you won’t have a problem, if you want an ssd you’ll have to read reviews first but the same principle applies</p>

              <p>something to note with the computers you listed specifically is they have “good” processors and not much else, you’ll notice they don’t list any specific graphics cards so you can bet your ass that the graphics will be integrated and/or not usable even on old games that didn’t require much graphics processing to start with</p>
<p>and the issue with server cpus is that they do not make good desktop cpus, even modern games don’t fully utilize 4 cores never mind dual cpu quad core systems with 8 threads each</p>

<p>so the first one doesn’t specify a graphics card… The second one says 256mb video, regardless of the card I can assume it’s trash</p>
<p>I figured the third one was way too ridiculous though. I don’t think 16gb ram and 1.5tb hdd is even near reasonable</p>
<p>Edit: actually I’m quite confused. When I researched the system it said it was mainly used for servers, yet also on the same dell webpage it says that it has ‘excellent graphics’.</p>
