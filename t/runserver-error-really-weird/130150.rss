I get this error on any name and if other people try logging in as well video quality isnt too good it says logging in and then says char file not found but usually when it says that it still logs you in and eventually saves and has the char file but it just keeps saying error connecting any ideas please iv tried everything i could think of that was causing it but no luck

All help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks.</description>
