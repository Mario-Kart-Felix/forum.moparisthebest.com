    <title>Found a way for player owned houses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/found-a-way-for-player-owned-houses/19669</link>
    <description>Ok this only works with -fedexer&#39;s- building tut. I thought we could change the objects is the void to make a new viod of player owned houses. It would have 4 levels, I thought:

1 - Non-mods

2 - Mods
3 - Admins
4 - Owner

We could make the object for it to be a cool house but theres 1 problem are the objects of player owned houses form rs in moparscape 3.1?</description>

              <p>I think the house owner doesn’t have a special kind of user right, I think there is a parameter in the file of the house itself that specifies who owns it, and when somebody in the house tries to expell guests or go in building mode, it first checks that they own it. Can you post a link to fedexers tut? I really wanna look at it. I dont think the objects are in mopar yet though, seeing as theres no house portal in rimmington.</p>

Well, my best guess is it would be some kind of array. From what I know, information about houses is stored in an entirely different file from the game engine AND the owners profile, because there would be no way to set up coordinates for somebody in a house, with out expanding the landscape  cache for each new house set up, a.k.a filling the game with laggy crap.<br>

<p>C’mon its gotta be possible somehow at least 20%…Something.</p>

For kicking players out of the house. I would make a command that when you IN the house you can kick the quest which would be like a command if you type ::expel it would teleport EVERYONE in your house to designated coordinates.</p>

Sets up pvp correctly to avoid more 666 massacres,<br>

<p>Jagex took 5 years to make POH, and they had to upgrade their game engine. Twice.<br>
And the houses suck nonetheless.<br>
