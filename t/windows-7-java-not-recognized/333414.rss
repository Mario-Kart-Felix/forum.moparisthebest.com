    <title>Windows 7 - java not recognized?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-7-java-not-recognized/333414</link>
    <description>Hello everyone. I recently bought a new laptop, which has the new Windows 7. I haven&#39;t been able to start any client i&#39;ve downloaded since I got the pc. All of them give the same error; &#39;java&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command. Sometimes with different clients the &#39;java&#39; is something like &#39;javaw&#39; or &#39;javac&#39;, depending on what clients i used. I Managed to get one client working, Silabgarza, by adding &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe&quot; -cp in place of the &#39;start java&#39;.  But I tried it for other servers, and it doesn&#39;t work.

Before you start flaming me for not knowing what i&#39;m doing, let me apologize for not being well versed in the language of computers. No, I don&#39;t know how to fix this, and it may be simple. But I am not one of those idiots that come here begging for help instead of at least trying to fix the problem on their own first. I tried, I failed. 

1 more thing, In my environmental variables, I don&#39;t have a CLASSPATH or a PATH set up, under admin or system, so that may be the problem. I have jdk6u18. 

Thanks for reading, 0wn4g3.</description>
