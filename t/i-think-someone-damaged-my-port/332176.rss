    <title>I think someone damaged my port?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-think-someone-damaged-my-port/332176</link>
    <description>I had my server up for about a week, and started to work on another source, and while i was away, i came back i noticed that the server i was currently hosting had a error on the run.bat and this comes up every little while...
Disconnecting bugged player null
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at stream.createFrame(stream.java:36)
        at client.logout(client.java:9946)
        at PlayerHandler.saveGame(PlayerHandler.java:380)
        at PlayerHandler.removePlayer(PlayerHandler.java:372)
        at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.java:259)
        at process.run(process.java:23)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
ClientHandler: Client null disconnected (bas2-london14-1167881631.dsl.bell.ca)
socket closed
java.net.SocketException: socket closed
        at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)
        at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:129)

        at client.run(client.java:17310)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)

Naturally, i tried restarting the server, and once again it started doing the same thing. I even tried a different source on the same port, and now that source did the same error. But when i run the server on a different port so far i have not gotten that error. I would like help on knowing what the problem or error is if anyone knows!


Also i found that this was wierd, whenever i restarted my server after awhile, some people try to connect, although i didnt have that many people on my server, i am able to log in because im the hoster, but when i log on i see a person and then they disconnect</description>

<p>How is that funny… So, maybe i worded my problem wrong, i was at first thinking in line of a ddos to my router through this port, but that would probably disabled my internet totally, so Call it what you want my port wasnt working.</p>
<p>And if your going to be in the “server Help” section", why don’t you actually give advice or find help instead of making random posts.</p>
