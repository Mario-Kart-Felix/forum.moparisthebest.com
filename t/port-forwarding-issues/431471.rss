    <title>Port-Forwarding issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-issues/431471</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t open the port (43594) no matter what I do. I&#39;ve tried everything I know, read, or been told.
I have a separate Modem &amp; router.
Modem- EQ-660R-F1
Router- Netgear WNDR3400
Yes, I have followed Portforwarding.com without success.
I have added exception in the fire, even turned it completely off. (also disabled the firewall in my modem)
I&#39;ve tried things like turning Qos on and adding a rule.
I&#39;ve opened the NAT in my router.
Disabled DOS protection and port scan.
Disabled IGMP Proxying.
I&#39;ve setup No-ip.
I&#39;ve tried the Utorrent thing.

Now, I really need someones help. you can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t try lol. I&#39;m thinking it has to do with my IP somewhere. But I honesly don&#39;t know to much on dealing with IP&#39;s. And what ones are supposed to match up with this and that. So if anyone can TV me and check things out I would appreciate that.
Thanks guys</description>
