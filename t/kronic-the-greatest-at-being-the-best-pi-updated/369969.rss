                                                            I created the Image its pretty awesome :P

[font=arial black][size=18pt]- Introduction - [/size][/font]  

[size=10pt][font=arial]Hey! I have been working on Kronic for a while now honestly too long but I am not ready to launch it so
I thought I would let you guys now and see if you could suggest things.

Firstly yes it is Project Insanity ^.^ I was using Delta but after seeing people hating on Delta i gave up and
turned towards PI.

[b]The Home is Lumbridge... I have not seen Lumbridge used as a home. So I thought why not.
I started coding around Lumbridge Deleting,Adding,Moving,Implanting, Objects. TBH I deleted a couple of door&#39;s not figuring out how to make them work properly but I must say when the door&#39;s are deleted it looks much neater ^.^
So i started coding Delta but after seeing how much people hated it I was afraid no one was going to join the server so instead i stopped and went after Project Insanity I must say there is a huge,huge change. I first started coding Savvier,James was a global moderator on that, but we then decided to quit that project and open up Kronic - Project Kronic. Since last month we have been working on Kronic, James has mostly been working on the Forum&#39;s,when I was working on the server. I will be updating what I have done. Not only will it entertain you,I hope, but it will also help me to keep track since i forgot a lot of things :P. [u][b][color=green]Remember to check back on this topic because it does get updated![/color][/b][/u][/b]
[/font][/size]

[b]I have added a portal to Slayer tower not excatly a portal but it stands up.. If you catch my drift :P
[/b]



James and I created the official Kronic website but at the moment we can&#39;t post it so contact me at shamil_gunak@hotmail.com or James at IxJamesxI@live.ca




[b]Workers -

Ara - Me [Owner]

Ix Soulcist xI - James [Owner][/b]




---------------------------------------


[size=24pt][color=green]Client --[/size]

Well towards the client I have changed the &quot;Item List&quot; or what ever it is to Forum&#39;s So instead of launching the Item list it will launch the Forum&#39;s I also added Donate,Vote... Which is not a big deal not a hard task to pull of.

[Update] November 24th 12:25am

I am working on the Log-In interface i must say it is hard not just the images but figuring it out through client.java,etc.


[Update] November 25th 11:25am

Added the runescape log in bars. So there gold or yellow,etc and they light up when you go over them. &lt;3

Some Media I promise[/b]
