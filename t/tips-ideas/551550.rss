    <title>Tips &amp; Ideas</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tips-ideas/551550</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I have been using this section quite a bit haven&#39;t I? Anyways, me and a friend of mine are money crazed. If you want to talk to me about money, that is a whole other story. Back on topic, I am looking for a way to make money online by selling services or products. I want to be an entrepreneur when I get older so getting business experience now as a teen would be nice. I eventually want to be making 10k a year just from doing this, I will tell you why in a bit. But I understand that coding is a way to make money, but I am not nearly good enough right now to sell things I code, and it would take like 2 years for me to get good enough to start selling games and apps and stuff. I am currently 16 and so if I found a way to make like 4k a year that would be crazy to me. I cannot think of a way to make money without coding really. I do sell graphics but there are so many other people who sell graphics, it is hard to find customers. If anybody knows of a good way to start making money online, and they would like to either share their ideas with me or even partner with me, that would just be wonderful. I have opened a forum in the past to try to get donations through that, but after like 3 months I started losing money so I closed it. If I started making 10k a year just from this, I would not have to get a real job until I went to college. If anybody is interested in partnering with me, and will be extremely committed, message me. But I am looking for ideas on what to do to earn money. I am willing to work hard at whatever the idea is and commit to the plan. 

Thanks!</description>

              <p>why do you even need the money right now? If you’re struggling, have you considered a loan? If you’re so fascinated by making money programming then maybe you should take advantage of all your free time and learn to code… would be a better investment of your time to do that now instead of after flipping burgers 9-5 because you just wanted to make a few quick bucks when you were a kid.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Cres, post:9, topic:551550”]Alot of money can come from “services” as private servers. Being able to make money on things you code requires you to have the proper connections and relations. People interested in people with talent. If you can get in touch with someone who did/does whatever you want to do, you could start there and no doubt you’ll meet more and more people on the way.</p>
<p>For specific ideas; look into simple RSPS (I estimate you can still pull a sloppy 1k/month without too many expenses), Minecraft private servers (no idea how that community is like but I do know there’s still alot of money to be gained there), app-development can get you a very nice payout if only people would hire you (same for all programming skills) and then ofcourse there’s investing in whatever you think is worthy.[/quote]</p>
<p>I have extremely good connections, but my coding skills aren’t good enough for people to hire me to work on their servers. 1k a month doesn’t sound right, that sounds too high. But I am not 100% sure.</p>

<p>Thanks for input everybody, I like your idea Whackatre. I’ll look more into freelance developing. Right now, any income is good for me!</p>
