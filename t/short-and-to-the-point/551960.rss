<p>Okay… So exactly what are you having an issue with then?<br>
The point of this section is to get help with an issue.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a programmer to work for you, then you should look at the <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,149.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Development Teams</a> section.</p>

              <p>If you are incapable of even getting a server online, what does that show to your projected player base? You should demonstrate your ability to be a good host and be capable of solving server issues on your own. Not to mention, offering goods for services on this site is still against the rules. As has been posted in the last couple thousand posts that look like this one.</p>
