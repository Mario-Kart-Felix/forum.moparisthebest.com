    <title>Picking flax doesn&#39;t work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/picking-flax-doesnt-work/275392</link>
    <description>For some reason, my flaxpicking case doesn&#39;t work.  I used the flax in Seers (ID 2646) and they just won&#39;t work.

[code]case 2646:
if(flaxTimer == 0) {
flaxTimer = 2;
startAnimation(827);
addItem(1779, 1);
sendMessage(&quot;You pick some flax.&quot;);
}
break;[/code]

I tried taking out the brackets, and the timer, but it just doesn&#39;t work.  Any ideas?

Note: I have it right above my trees, and right after doors (THEY ALL WORK FINE)</description>
