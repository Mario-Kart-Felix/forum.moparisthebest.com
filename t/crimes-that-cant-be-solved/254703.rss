    <description>what happens when there are 2 equallaly likely suspects to a crime? 

From what i can gather, no one gets in trouble correcT?


So my way of thinking... someone is found dead, clearly only one person was in the room and only one person killed this person. If someone, and his friend both claim to be this one person, if theres no way to prove which one, then both get away free?</description>

You can go to the supreme court though, can’t you? They look at your case, and decide whether the trial has to be redone.<br>

Double jeopardy (non bis in idem) is a procedural defense (and, in many countries such as the United States, Canada, Mexico and India, a constitutional right) that forbids that a defendant be tried twice for the same crime on the same set of facts.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia, but it says on the same set of facts, if there gets new evidence there would be different.</p>

<p>And besides, if you both confess, they can call it a planned murder or conspiracy and the punishment might even be harder. Planned murder is worse then unplanned.[/quote]<br>
Planning to kill someone is murder - killing someone without intent to kill them is manslaughter, or second degree murder. Intent, mens rea (the state of mind), is key to a person being done for murder rather than manslaughter.</p>

Where were you educated lol? A non-coerced confession is more than enough to convince a jury beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.<br>
It’s not without doubt, it’s beyond reasonable doubt. The guilty verdict doesn’t require a unanimous decision anymore in NSW either; only 11 of the 12 jurors must vote guilty. Whether or not queensland has adopted this is beyond me.</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s not true. The art of polygraphy is built on lies and deception.<br>
The first move of any polygrapher is to establish dominance and control over the subject. This is achieved in several ways. For example, the subject may be ordered to move their chair from its current location to the location of the polygraph machine.</p>
<p>Secondly they establish, through deceit, that the polygraph is both reliable and accurate. There are numerous ways to do this. For arguments sake they may offer the subject a deck of cards, instructing them to take one. What the subject doesn’t know is that the deck of cards is made up of 52 king of hearts, or whatever. They then pretend to deduce that the person has this card by asking them questions related to the card they are holding - what the subject doesn’t know is that it was set up from the very beginning, and that they’ve been hoodwinked.</p>
<p>When it comes to questioning, there are several types of questions.<br>
The most prominent of the questions is what’s called a control question - this is used by the polygrapher to establish how the person’s body actually responds when they answer honestly or dishonestly.<br>
Truth be told, the response can be faked if one can recognise control questions. For example, flexing of the rectum or biting of the tongue (in a subtle manner!) would produce a far greater response. When the person then lies, the response generated by the lie will either be less than or equal to the response to the control questions, which means that the person either ‘passes’ the polygraph exam or the polygraph exam is written off as inconclusive.</p>

<p>Just read this bit. I’d imagine that both could be charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice or something like that. I dunno how precedent works in America (or if it even exists there), but I would imagine that a judge residing over such a case would not be bound by precedent, and as such he could give them extremely high penalties such as life in prison.</p>

<p>But if you leave the trial due to reasonable doubt, is it still considered double jeopardy?<br>
And then couldn’t you get tried for some other part of the crime that they hadn’t specifically charged you with and set you free of?</p>
<p>They will most likely have their ways of getting you for something else.  Only example I can think of that led to a total mindfuck of the US court system is the OJ one, but they don’t get away that easily too often…</p>

<p>In that case, the cops offer both of us a shorter punishment, in trade for a real confession. Obviously, the one who didn’t do it cracks. Why go to jail for 20 years, for something you didn’t do? In the end, they’ll find out who did it. Unless you’re dealing with some mastermind.</p>

The only way you could pull this off is if you both have an exact replica of the weapon (same cracks, same everything) and both have the same gloves, shoes, clothes and a hair cover. ETC. Would take far too long. Or, you could just use some sort of magnetic levitation device which you use, then you can destroy the rest of the evidence by dumping it in the middle of the indian ocean or giving it to some russian.</p>
