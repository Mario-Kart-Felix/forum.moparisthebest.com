    <title>Okay so</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/okay-so/424115</link>
    <description>Serious thread is serious, we have an issue and serious clashes between Davidi2 and myself (nothing new really). So I share Davidi2s view that the server is suffering here so I think we should have a little bit of both worlds, myself and Davidi2 represent the 2 sides of Moparcraft (pvp and builder so we can cater for both this way).

From my understanding:

Davidi2 - Want a building world where people can build and have nice little things while not having to worry about being pvped on. (Minority, do not deny it!)

Tom_BETA - Wants a PVP world (basically W2 except with PVP on) (Majority)

So I propose this, get rid of World 1 and make it into a creative/building world (whatever). I know what Moparisthebest is going to say: No. But I&#39;m going to challenge that view because it&#39;s just pointless keeping W1 now and is only damaging the server.

Wanted to post this here before moving it into Moparcraft discussion so the staff team could have a closed discussion on it first.

Let&#39;s leave old arguments out of this, I&#39;ve been saying get rid of W1 for a builder world since the begining of time and I&#39;m sure Davidi2 has as well so it would be stupid to ignore such a beneficial thing. 

 :) ;) :D :eek: :cool: :rolleyes: :P ;D :) ;) :D</description>

<p>[ul][li]When? Are we waiting for 1.0?[/li][li]Specifications? Just a normal world with mobs on/no pvp?[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>As I said before:</p>
<p>I think no pvp, mobs on, no flying/spawning and just building. So basic vanilla with no pvp.</p>

Your guy’s whole strategy revolves around them not knowing you are there, so don’t try to twist it around and pretend that the defenses matter at all. You guys get through them before they know you are there, and kill them when they are not ready. Badger had a chance because he had friends with him.</p>

<p>Take Badger41 and his crew for example, I bit of more than I could chew the first time I attacked him and completely underestimated his compounds defenses, he almost ended up killing me (I had to retreat) he is an example of an organized builder, someone who caters for both worlds.</p>
<p>In reality, the defenders do have the upper hand, not the attackers. If done correctly the defenders will clear the floor of the attackers (Moparisthebests fortress is another prime example of an organized builder).</p>

<blockquote>Bullying is a form of aggressive behavior manifested by the use of force or coercion to affect others, particularly when the behavior is habitual and involves an imbalance of power. It can include verbal harassment, physical assault or coercion and may be directed repeatedly towards particular victims</blockquote>
Fits right in really. 'Aggressive behavior', 'affects others', 'habitual', 'physical assault' etc. 
<p>But really the point isn’t weather or not you are bullying, I’m just saying that’s what people like myself, that prefer the sandbox side of Minecraft, hate about the server, and why they all left.</p>

<p>Bulying: Use superior strength or influence to intimidate (someone), typically to force him or her to do what one wants.</p>
<p>Firstly, we don’t PVP to force someone to do it we PVP because it’s fun and because it’s very profitable. Who says I have superior strength over these people? Every single person on this server started in the same place I did, it’s a level playing field so there is no reason why these builders can’t use their logic and avoid being subject to PVP.</p>
<p>Bullying is a hard thing to get out of (typically), this isn’t the case here. This is why I’m all for the night plugin, it’s a bit of both worlds, but the changing of the PVP completely (turning it off despite it being on for long periods of time) was uncalled for.</p>

              <p>World 2 without PVP just isn’t fun, I can’t cope anymore and it’s only been a few days as well. Everything I’ve built is with PVP in mind, everything I have is based on PVP and I’m sure many others have the same issue (I’m sure you read my post outlining that most the PVP base were bored when PVP was off in it’s natural form and so resort to burning people and finding new ways of killing them instead).</p>
<p>A faction plugin would be a joke anyway, that’s just not fun, what is fun is secretly organizing against others  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>I’ll never compromise for no original PVP at all, even if it’s at night only. But no PVP is no fun, I’m not talking about a pvp plugin or anything I’m talking about original PVP.</p>

<p>Though I hate splitting the population like that… but I guess it’s ok for now. I still think we should find a faction plugin for that world, because PvP in that way was fun. Just leave PvP off until we find it this time please hehe.</p>

<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:30, topic:424036”]Point is, the most popular days of the server was when you could build freely without the fear of PvP when you didn’t want to. At the time, if I remember correctly, there were still organized raids between factions and those were fun. But it wasn’t the shit you [i]guys<a>/i</a> do now, where you sneak up on someone and kill them for their stuff or to ‘punish’ them for being annoying or whatever.[/quote]Basically that. It was fun to begin with but you guys ruined it and scared everyone away</p>
<p>So yea, unless we can get that back, I want PvP off.</p>

              <p>Serious thread is serious, we have an issue and serious clashes between Davidi2 and myself (nothing new really). So I share Davidi2s view that the server is suffering here so I think we should have a little bit of both worlds, myself and Davidi2 represent the 2 sides of Moparcraft (pvp and builder so we can cater for both this way).</p>
<p>From my understanding:</p>
<p>Davidi2 - Want a building world where people can build and have nice little things while not having to worry about being pvped on. (Minority, do not deny it!)</p>
<p>Tom_BETA - Wants a PVP world (basically W2 except with PVP on) (Majority)</p>
<p>So I propose this, get rid of World 1 and make it into a creative/building world (whatever). I know what Moparisthebest is going to say: No. But I’m going to challenge that view because it’s just pointless keeping W1 now and is only damaging the server.</p>
<p>Wanted to post this here before moving it into Moparcraft discussion so the staff team could have a closed discussion on it first.</p>
<p>Let’s leave old arguments out of this, I’ve been saying get rid of W1 for a builder world since the begining of time and I’m sure Davidi2 has as well so it would be stupid to ignore such a beneficial thing.</p>
