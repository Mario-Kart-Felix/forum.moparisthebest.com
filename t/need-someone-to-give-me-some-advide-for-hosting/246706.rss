    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-to-give-me-some-advide-for-hosting/246706</link>
    <description>Ok, so, I want to get a dedicated host. Can someone tell me a website that is good for that? And people say you need a stable source that doesn&#39;t need an autorestart so, what is a good source for that?</description>

              <p>Theres no such thing as a stable source really its how many times you restart your server, how good of a connection you have to the interet, and your SYIpkpker blocker. If you dont have SYIpkpker blocker i suggest you get one before its to late.</p>
