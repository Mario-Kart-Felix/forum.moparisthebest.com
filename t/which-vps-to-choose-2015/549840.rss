    <title>Which VPS to choose? [2015]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-vps-to-choose-2015/549840</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,

A few friends and I are starting up a RSPS 718 (Rune-Evo 3) more or less just for fun but if other people join that would just be a bonus. I am currently looking for a reliable VPS, I have done quite a bit of googling around but most forum post are out of date. I was going to try Trentahost but it seems recently they have ALOT of downtime. I also have heard good things about VPSLand, However like I said most of these post I read are from 2010-2012.

If anyone could post some VPS&#39;s that they have used in the past for hosting a RSPS it would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you everyone!  :D

PS. What size VPS would I need? (Server file is 855mb)</description>

              <p>Personally, ovh is very cheap, you get what you pay for.</p>
<p>In my experience, running a server is all about the uplink (bandwidth/speed). More than it is about the RAM anyway. Any server source ive hosted or messed about with sits at 300~mb RAM usage on a linux distro. Never goes above 512. You should be safe with 1G memory. As for uplink, 1Gbps is good but i’ve seen other places with more for cheap.</p>
<p>Saying that, if you are really serious about running on a professional gaming server:<br>

<p>Is the best value price i’ve seen.</p>
<p>Check out lowendbox occasionally for some great offers.</p>

              <p>Alright tonight I am going to purchase a VPS from OVH could anybody tell me which vps I need for apx 5-10 people? The server file is 855mb so should VPS Classic 1 work? (1 GB Ram, 10 GB HDD, 100 Mbps Bandwidth) or do I need something more like  VPS Classic 2 (2 GB Ram, 25 GB HDD, 100 Mbps Bandwidth)</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone.</p>
