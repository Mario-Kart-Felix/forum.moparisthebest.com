    <title>Finally the Jar Error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/finally-the-jar-error/444211</link>
    <description>Well I finally got a new client and I could finally actually open the jar file this time, but now its giving me an error.
The error is
A Java Exception Has Occured.
How can I fix this?
Just to let you know there is no cache in my client folder because I got the auto cache downloader. 
So whats wrong?
Thanks</description>
