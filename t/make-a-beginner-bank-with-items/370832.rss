    <title>Make a beginner bank with items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-a-beginner-bank-with-items/370832</link>
    <description>How would add items to the players bank when they first join (starter bank) something like the commonly used &#39;starter inventory&#39; all i want to add is like, whip, runes, food, etc...
and also if i added this, would it only work for the first time when they log in, and not every time they re-log. if you can help me with this, i would love you, this is the completion to this new server i&#39;ve been working on, kthxbai.

Help Appreciated,
