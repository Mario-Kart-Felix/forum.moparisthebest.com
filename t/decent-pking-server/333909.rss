    <title>Decent Pking Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/decent-pking-server/333909</link>
    <description>Ok so there are alot of &quot;Pking&quot; servers coming out atm that last like 3 weeks and are no good when they are released in the first place... so we need a decent reliable pking server like google.com(stork) that everyone liked and was just for pking. It was up and down for a while but that was because the people running it where like 14 year old kids who only wanted it to make money - But it did have a good following.... Ive been around rsc(since its first release)/rsc private servers alot longer than most people but i havent developed anything untill recently(not released yet) so im not very well known/respected.
I know a few people around here have the source so thats not the problem but someone who is reliable and able to run the server well(and not be in it for the money), needs to get hold of it and release it.

Now im not gonna say anything like give me the source as i wouldnt be willing to run it/have the experience to do it as i know its based off a released source that im not familiar with.
People want a server that is like this and i know and speak to 30+ people that liked stork and would love to have it back but ran better(without the rollback and the account wipes and the changing of points to exp ratio ect ect).

People bitch and moan about these boards but its in everyones best interests to have good servers inorder to attract new people and keep rsc alive(as we all know its nearly dead) - I think it would attract old members back aswell.


OK so its time for you all to flame away....

Thanks for looking :D

              <p>its hard to make a good server that every1 likes. look at beyond that was supposed to be run by the players for the players. lasted what, 2 weeks? the community doesn’t know what it wants thats what the owner is for, to make all the big decisions. but i agree with what u said it needs some1 who is not in it for the money. thats one reason rsca lasted this long it has the right stuff <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> just a few tweaks need to be done</p>
