    <description>So, what do you think it is?

If eBooks, then could some gracious soul link me to some? Thank you! :D</description>

<p>I was talking about the fixed BCEL, but that’d be great too - I’d like to see how he set ASM to manipulation instead of generation.</p>

Anyway, a project like that would require a team of dedicated and skilled coders, or we’d end up with something very much not worth the effort. What were some of the more glaring BCEL bugs, and do you know if  Sun has done anything about them (doesn’t Sun use bits of BCEL in some of the more obscure API?)<br>

I’ve wanted to finish my own bytecode library for a while now, but lack time to do it all myself.<br>
Do we <em>have</em> a suitable group of potential developers who might be interested?</p>

Sorry I didnt mean to sound like a dick there, but I did. I am not sure what I would suggest, I havent touched java bytecode stuff since I was in the rs “scene”, which I am certainly no longer a part of and have not been for a long time. And yes asm really dosent do what would be wanted in a good manner, saevion actually ported some of the deober to asm only to his own frustration.<br>

<p>Yeah, thing about bytecode manipulation is, it’s got almost ZERO application outside of reverse engineering/software protection, since the point of Java is to not think about how your code is actually being run on a given platform.[/quote]</p>

When I said look for alternatives I meant there MUST be a better api out there you guys could be using for this, which is in proper development. I mean, there MUST right? If not, hrm, why not pull together and make one? (Obviously this would be no trivial project, it would require alot of work and effort into it. But it could possibly fill a gap in the free software market and give some of the other developers here experiance in another area?)<br>

<p>That’s what I thought, too, but apparently we’re wrong.<br>
In a similar vein, just try finding a decent (or even COMPLETE) free Java audio editing/DSP library…[/quote]</p>

<p>I was never a big fan of javassist either tbh.</p>
<p>Never looked @ serp.</p>
<p>Never looked @ jclasslib.</p>

<p>I will have a look and see if I can find anything thou.</p>
<p>edit1: I just had a quick look at jclasslib, and might I add a very quick look. It isnt going to do your bcel magics for pattern recognition, and it handles the opcodes as direct bytes so dont expect any magic here either. Its seems to me its a straight ol java class referance =&gt; pojos deal.</p>

<p>Why are we still using bcel? The project was discontinued a long time ago and it had alot of glaring bugs which hadnt been fixed. Look into alternatives?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We’re still using BCEL because no one wants to write his own search methods. What alternatives would you suggest?</p>
<p>[ul][li]ASM is good, but it’s not really meant for editing existing classes like we do with BCEL.[/li]<br>
[li]Javassist lacks search and power (though it does tie into an AOP framework).[/li]<br>
[li]SERP, if I remember correctly, only supports the visitor model (not fatal, I just don’t like it).[/li]<br>
[li]jclasslib has been suggested to me, but I haven’t looked into it.[/li][/ul]</p>

Theres no “best” way to learn an API, but instead of coming here and asking how to learn it, why don’t you just go learn it on your own? Just read the documentation, and if you know enough to actually use the API by yourself then you shouldn’t need someone to write you a tutorial.<br>

The way I did it was, just pick up the API and start fooling around with the RS client. Also, reading the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/2nd-edition/html/ClassFile.doc.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">VM Spec Chapter 4</a> helped alot since terminology used in there is used within BCEL. But I warn you, it’s a pretty heavy read. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

<p>I’m surprised how no one mentioned it before. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, writing a class file reader from that was the most helpful thing I did to understand bytecode.</p>
<p>RLN has a point about asking how to learn an API, but would you say the same thing about another API? Say, OpenGL? No, you wouldn’t, tutorials are extremely helpful there if you don’t understand graphics theory - just as BCEL tutorials would be helpful to someone who is trying to understand bytecode theory.</p>
<p>Presenting existing information in a more understandable or concrete way does not equate to “spoon-feeding”</p>
