    <title>MugorPkz; Looking For Development Team:</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mugorpkz-looking-for-development-team/350701</link>
    <description>Dear Members,

I am currently under construction of creating a server. The server will be a 508 but as you can tell by the name, the server will be a &#39;Pking&#39; server. At the moment all i have got is a forum. I know people are thinking this is going to fail, but personally in my own view you should create a forum first. In my development&#39;s team i need; 2 Moderators, 2 Global Moderators 1 or 2 Coders And 2 GFX Designers.. I am under a consuming question of hiring an adminstator but please check back for updates.
Below is some pictures of the forum to prove that the forum and server are going ahead: (sorry there are none of the server as most view&#39;s would like to view the server more)
