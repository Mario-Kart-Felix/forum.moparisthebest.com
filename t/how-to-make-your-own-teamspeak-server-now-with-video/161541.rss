    <description>    VIEDO; My first YouTube video tutorial (remember to post for help) [b]WITH VOICE[/b]: [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDJU8H2lmPU]Click here for the video![/url]

       A guide on how to make your own TeamSpeak server. TeamSpeak is a VoIP that allows you to talk to other people to get on and basically talk to each other over the microphone.


Before we get started, go to http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads and download a TeamSpeak Server and Client.

1) When your done downloading the TeamSpeak2 Server, open it (If it already hasn&#39;t). A screen should pop up giving you an &quot;Admin username and password&quot; and &quot;SuperAdmin username and password&quot;. You want to right those two both of those down, I just copy and pasted to notepad.

2) Now If you already don&#39;t know your WAN and LAN IP, you can find them this way. In the taskbar, right click  on the TeamSpeak2 server. It will give you the option of &quot;Administration&quot; or  &quot;Your IP&quot;. You can find your WAN and LAN IP in &quot;Your IP&quot;. The 192.168.X.X is your LAN and your WAN is the other. Right them down somewhere.

3) Click on the &quot;Administration&quot; tab when you right-click on the TeamSpeak2 Server. It should bring up another window, and login with your &quot;SuperAdmin Username and Password&quot; you wrote down in step one.

4) What your going to do now is create your own SuperAdmin Username and Password, so click &quot;SuperAdmin Manager&quot; on the MainMenu. Click &quot;Add Client&quot; and make yourself a username and password. Then go back the the SuperAdmin Manager and delete the old one that you logged in with.

5) Click &quot;Servers&quot; on the MainMenu, then you should see &quot;Stop, Delete, and Select&quot; click on &quot;SELECT&quot;

6) Now were going to create your own Admin Username and Password. (This is what you use to login to your server) Click &quot;UserManager&quot; on the MainMenu, then &quot;Add Client&quot;. Fill out a username and password [b](Be sure to check &quot;ServerAdmin&quot;!!)[/b]

7) Then go back and delete the old one that says &quot;admin&quot;.

8) Click &quot;Server Settings&quot;, thats all pretty self-explanatory. Just customize it to how you want and save, also thats where you can choose your servers UDP Port. [b](Default= 8767)[/b] 

  Now your done!(Of course your behind a router) Just give out your IP to your friends and they can get on. (Look under extras on how to create a no-ip so you can use that as a redirect. 
[b]
++ If it still doesn&#39;t let you on, make sure your ports are forwarded correctly. If it still doesn&#39;t work, open those ports on your firewall as well++[/b]

[size=10pt][u][b]~~Extras~~[/b][/u][/size]

-Port Forwarding-

If you don&#39;t know how to Port Forward, go to http://www.portforward.com/
  
Ports that should be open: 

1. (Your Server UDP Port) Default= 8767
 *Optional Ports* (You might have to open these, mine aren&#39;t for security purposes)
 - 51234 TCP 
 - 14534

[b]- No-Ip -[/b]

 Instead of handing out your IP to everyone you can create a redirect. 
Go to http://www.no-ip.com/
 Sign-up, under &quot;Hosts/Redirects&quot; click &quot;ADD&quot;

1. Choose a hostname and if the IP address there isn&#39;t the same one you see when your right click your TeamSpeak2 server and go to &quot;Your IPs&quot;, change it so it is.
 *Leave everything else the same and click create host*

Now give that hostname you just created to people, instead of your WAN IP.
[b]

-Log into your Server-[/b]
1. Open TeamSpeak2 client, click &quot;Quick Connect&quot;.
2. The Server Address is either 127.0.0.1 or the hostname you created on No-IP or your WAN IP.
     NickName= Anything
     Username= Your Admin username you created Step 6.
     Password= Your Passwrd
 Click &quot;Connect&quot; and your in!

[b]-3rd Party Applications and Scripts-[/b]
 Go to http://forum.teamspeak.com/forumdisplay.php?f=51 
These are very helpful to increase security and other things on your server.
