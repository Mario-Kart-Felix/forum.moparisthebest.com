[center]We all remember and love the Cammy PvP source, for me it holds a special place in my RsPs journey in that I think that it was a turning point on the way that people view Private Servers. Cammy PvP was one of the most fun servers I have played to this day. This source was a major throwback for me and I feel that I have done enough work to this server to where other people might enjoy it too.[/center]
