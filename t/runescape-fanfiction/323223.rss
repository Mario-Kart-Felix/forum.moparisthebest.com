    <title>RuneScape Fanfiction</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-fanfiction/323223</link>
    <description>As a young boy, I always adored Zezima; he was a paragon of strength to me - he was dedicated and resolute, hardened and unyielding, a powerful warrior. I wanted to be the caddy to his Tiger Woods, the Hammer to his Spike, the whipped cream to his soft and tasty cherry. But such things seemed out of reach to me. I was a lowly level three, while he was a mighty max-level. I added him, but his chat was usually off. In the brief moments in which it was on, I sent him as many messages of love as I could. But to no avail. Inevitably, he would turn it back off moments later.

So what was I to do? I leveled up, fighting goblins and rats, cooking cakes for the Duke of Lumbridge, and chasing monsters out of Fred&#39;s farm. But this didn&#39;t seem to impress him. I was just another player to him, who wanted him only for his status. But in truth, I really loved him. I wanted to feel his thick, hairy arms around me as he whispered sweet nothings into my ear. We were starstruck lovers. He just didn&#39;t know it yet.

I saw him in my world once. I quickly followed him, yelling colorful, wavy messages, and setting fires in the shape of a swastika. But he logged off. I would never see him again. Days later, someone told me that he was in the rogue&#39;s castle, deep in the wilderness. I was in Varrock. I ran quickly through the woods, running past giants, salamanders, and lava, avoiding impalation by black unicorns and hammertime with the chaos dwarves. I reached the wilderness gate. I stopped briefly to grab a sapphire, but was wounded by a nest of spiders.

I fled and quickly scarfed down a lobster. I made it past the gate and had almost reached the castle, when I was assaulted by a revenant. I was wounded and quickly frozen in place. &quot;Zezima! Zezima!&quot; I called, but he was nowhere to be found. I stood no chance against the undead dragon. I died, barraged by missiles and arrows, my love unrequited.</description>
