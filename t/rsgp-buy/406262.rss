<p>I’d be suprised if it was higher then ~5%. Though that ratio might be higher for players currently online, since bots can be left on all the time and most humans can’t.

This comes from someone who has been playing with high levels on members for quite some time. The only places you see bots are essence mining, flax picking etc. You don’t see them on higher level places because they’re usually banned very quickly.[/quote]I believe this is false.  Like stated above, gold farming sites run tons of accounts over tons of worlds.  How do you really know all those people in there aren’t botting?  You have to look at the big picture, and not just wherever you are on whatever world.</p>

<p>true story, source: fox news.</p>
<p>I dont know why they dont ban bots, the only incentive I can clearly see is for more profit. there are more botters paying subscriptions over and over again and not that many members leaving so for them from a business point of view they might as well leave it as the number of players leaving doesn’t cover the amount of players starting to bot and continue the memberships.</p>
