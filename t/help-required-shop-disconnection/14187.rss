    <title>[Help Required] Shop Disconnection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-required-shop-disconnection/14187</link>
    <description>Normally I don&#39;t bother with adding new things that aren&#39;t there in the real RS but this time I felt like adding a Fairy near Varrock Fountain that sells Dragon Items...
Seems every time I trade her, the shop doesn&#39;t open, it just disconnect/reconnects my client. 

Here&#39;s the process I did things, If someone could tell me what I did wrong and supply a correction I would appreciate it.

First of all I looked in my NPC.cfg for a likely candidate to be my store owner...
I chose this... npc = 534 Fairy_Shop_Keeper 99999 3000

I wrote down the ID for her &quot;534&quot; and then opened up my AutoSpawn.cfg

In this I declared the following: spawn = 534 3218 3432 0 0 0 0 0 1 Fairy_Shopkeeper

So now (I used her ID, 534) I have the fairy hovering in varrock ready to do her business...

Next up I supplied the information for the shop in the Shops.cfg file which looks like this:
shop = 31 @gre@Dragon_Supplies 1 1 1149 1 3140 1 4087 1 4585 1 1187 1

(I know this shop works because I tested it on the Varrock General Store keeper so all the items listed are available in the shop)

The ID &quot;31&quot; was the next in line in my Shops.cfg and I wrote down that number.

Following this I opened up my Client.java and searched for the line WanneShop = 30;

After the closing bracket to that particular block of code I wrote in this...
else if(NPCID == 534) // ID of my Fairy ShopKeeper
{
	PutNPCCoords = true;
	WanneShop = 31; // ID of my Shop
}

After I wrote all that and cleared up any mistakes in my coding, it compiled successfully.

I started my server and went In-Game, walked to Varrock and tried to Trade with the Fairy Shopkeeper that was there but all it does it cause my client to disconnect then reconnect
(As if someone turned off and rebooted the server real fast)

I followed everything by the book and there&#39;s nothing wrong with my JAVA knowledge so what seems to be the problem in this case?</description>

              <p>Many thanks…<br>
All works fine now, placed her code under the code for varrock armour store.</p>
<p>Any reason why this happens?<br>
The game reads the cfg files as information packets why should it matter WHERE the code for a shopkeeper goes? is there something written in another file that says shopkeepers have to be under one another?</p>

              <p>LOL, I did everything you mentioned in your tutorial except you said it’s “2 2” what makes the shop buy everything like a general store, well you’re wrong, all the general stores are set to “1 1”</p>
<p>1 is General<br>
2 is Specialist</p>
<p>First number is “Sell type” second is “Buy type”</p>
<p>1 1<br>
a general store, buys any item and sells any item it has bought.</p>
<p>2 2<br>
a specialist store, like a rune shop, you can only buy and sell runes there.</p>
<p>2 1<br>
would mean they only Sell what has been set in the shop.cfg<br>
they will buy anything from you but you can only buy back what they specialise in</p>
<p>1 2<br>
Well this would mean they only buy things they specialise in but sell anything they got<br>
No shop has the 1 2 configuration because no shop can sell “anything” if it can’t buy it…</p>
<p>Other then that your tutorial is exactly what I did and it still doesn’t fire up.<br>
Oh yeah, and you used 535 which is the fairy shop keepers assistant…</p>
