    <title>Photoshop Mysteriously Gone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/photoshop-mysteriously-gone/161707</link>
    <description>Today I logged on to my computer and felt like doing some more stuff in photoshop CS2, only to find it mysteriously gone... I&#39;m reinstalling it right now and it says I have 8 days to active it, so my trial didn&#39;t run out, but does anyone know why this could of happened?

Oh, and if someone has a CS2 crack they could send me via PM that would be nice.</description>

<p>Ha, is if I would my parents even come near my $3000 system. I just reinstalled it and all my old settings were back, the color I last used, all my brushes, my old serial number, etc. And I’ll check tpb</p>
