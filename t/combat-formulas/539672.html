<p>Hello. This has probably being posted before. I am currently writing a combat from scratch and I want make it as good as possible in any manners. This being said, I am gathering all data and information from different sites. None of them all completed and it’s being like a puzzle. I want to talk in the thread about how combat is handled. By that, I mean combat formulas. We all know the three combat types(Melee, Ranged &amp; Magic). First let’s begging with the design. From my sources, it’s supposenly something like this:<br>
MaxHitFormula * AccuracyFormula * HitChance<br>
I highly doubt that a server got the formulas perfected. So that’s why I greater this thread. To actually acquire a conversation on this subject. To discuss the proper ones and how any small things can affect combat. And in the conclusion, get a proper combat aspect idea. This can be usefull not only for programmers and developers but also to players who would want to prepare in so called ‘PK’ combat. Without further explanation on this subject, let’s begging with my sources. I will modify the thread to finally organize the whole combat formulas.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Max Hit Formula</span></p>
<p>I would say that this is the easiest one to be honest. From different resources, I’ve organized this a bit. The main formula must I’ve something between 001 and 1400(haven’t seen more). It is the maximum damage your player/character can take.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Max hit

Physical damage

Maximum hit is calculated the same way for both melee and ranged combat. It is based entirely on level, current equipment, prayers and special attacks. Follow the steps below to compute a maximum hit.
Effective Strength level
Your effective strength level is one of the two main values that determines how hard you hit. It is based on your strength level in melee combat, and it is based on your ranged level in ranged combat.

Let your current Strength (Ranged) level, including potions, equal a variable A.

If you are using the Leech Strength or Leech Ranged curse, add the displayed percentage minus one to A. The minimum addition is 4, and the maximum addition is 9.


Prayers and Curses

Let B equal 1.00.

If you are using melee combat with prayers or curses, add the following to B as applicable.

Burst of Strength: 0.05
Superhuman Strength: 0.10
Ultimate Strength: 0.15
Chivalry: 0.18
Piety: 0.23
Leech Strength: 0.05
Turmoil: 0.23

If you are using ranged combat with prayers or curses, add the following to B as applicable:

Sharp Eye: 0.05
Hawk Eye: 0.10
Eagle Eye: 0.15
Rigour: 0.20
Leech Ranged: 0.05

Finally, if you are wearing the Amulet of Zealots while using a prayer or curse that boosts a single skill, add a further 0.05 to B.

For example, if you were using the "Superhuman Strength" Prayer while equipped with an Amulet of Zealots, B would equal 1.00 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 1.15. It is important that you do not round this number.

Your "Effective Strength", C is denoted as: C = (A * B) + 8
Round C down to the nearest integer now.



Combat Style Bonuses

If you are fighting using melee combat, then further modify C as follows:
If you are using the Turmoil curse, add 9 to C.
If you are using the Aggressive combat style, add 3 to C.
If you are using the Controlled combat style, add 1 to C.

If you are fighting using ranged combat, then further modify C as follows:
If you are using the Accurate combat style, add 3 to C.
Void Knight Set Bonuses

If you are using a full set of Void Knight armour, then its effect further modifies effective strength.
If you are using the full Void Knight Melee set, multiply C by 1.1 and then round down.
If you are using the full Void Knight Ranged set, multiply C by 1.1, round down, and then do so a second time. This means that the ranged set increases C by approximately 20%.

Base Damage
Look at your equipment screen, and note your Strength or Ranged Strength equipment modifier, depending on the type of combat you are using. Let this modifier equal D.
You should not have rounded any of your values yet in your calculations. Your maximum hit can be calculated with any of the three equivalent formulae below:
Max = 5 + C + C*D/64
Max = 5 + C * (D + 64) / 64
Max = 5 + C * (1 + D/64)
Round down your answer to get your maximum damage with the desired level, equipment and prayer before any special attacks are applied.
Bonus Damage
Some special attacks and equipment cause an increase in damage dealt. Apply bonuses from the following categories in the given order. Only the first valid bonus from each category will apply. Round down the result after each step.

Fire: 40

Bonus Damage
There are several ways to increase the damage dealt by a magic attack. Add them in the following order, and round down the total damage after each step.
Equipment Bonus

If you are wearing equipment that increases your magic damage, then multiply your damage by that amount. For example, if your total magic damage bonus (shown on the equipment screen) is 30%, multiply your damage by 1.30.
