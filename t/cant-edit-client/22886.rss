    <title>Cant edit client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-edit-client/22886</link>
    <description>Well i got a new server (megascape based, which is ts, which is cheezscape based) and i ccan edit most of the files, i edit item values and they change, i edit which monsters spawn where and it works. I USED to be able to change things in the client aswell, e.g. changing &quot;Welcome to Megascape&quot; and adding more commands and so forth. However, now whenever i try to change anything in the client, the document itself stays changed but when i open up the game client and start playing, nothing happens. An example:
I made a new command called Tprunes, that simply gave you runes for teleporting without all the combat stuff at the same time. I went in the game and tried to use it and nothing happened... I was curious so i then went and changed the amount of runes you obtained from the original cbrunes spell from 1000k to 250k. I go into the game and type ::cbrunes and i still get 1000k runes from it.
      Now, i dont know when i stopped being able to use this because i havent played the game in a few weeks and only noticed now, however i believe it may have occured when i bought a new computer and installed it, i had to re-install the jdk, jre files and mopar etc etc. 

Anybody have any idea  whats happened and how i can fix it?
