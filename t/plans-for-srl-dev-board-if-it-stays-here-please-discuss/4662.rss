    <title>Plans for SRL Dev board if it stays here (please discuss)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/plans-for-srl-dev-board-if-it-stays-here-please-discuss/4662</link>
    <description>I do not want to take it over at all, sorry if it seemed that way, I was just busy moving things

1. I was thinking we nominate a leader to make all the administrative decisions for SRL, that leader we elect will become a global mod on the whole forum, with the added abilities to modify/add boards in the SRL sections, and have full control over the SRL dev group (as in be able to add in new members and take out members) In other words they will have administrative power over everything SRL and SCAR, they also will have admin on sourceforge for the svn.

2. all of the mods/admins from srl already have full mod power over these srl boards, If SRL stays here I will give them full moderator power over all of the SCAR boards too.

3. In case some of you are worried about others seeing the dev boards, none of the global mods can see them except those that are devs, and there are 4 admins that of course can see these boards, Starblaster and I are already devs, so the only 2 that can see this that arent devs are Waffendennis and Algas, I dont think that would pose a problem would it?

4. I have already gotten us cvs hosting with sourceforge, the address is scarsrl.sourceforge.net, I will post info on how to get in soon here, and like I said before admin the one we choose to lead us, and he can deadmin me from the project

5. The final decision is in the hands of the devs collectively, if the majority wants to move then thats what we will do :)</description>

              <p>Well all we really need to do is make a new leader somewhat. Then all the desicions will fall into place. For example say fawki was here he would just say ok go to these forums --&gt; <a href="http://www.whatever.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.whatever.com</a>  &lt;-- then we wuold all go there and follow his lead. Wouldnt need so much discussion because of executive desicions.</p>
<p>For leader i rally purpose. Danky, Flyboy, Mopar or someone else fully mature enough to handle the immaturity sometimes involved with the job.</p>
