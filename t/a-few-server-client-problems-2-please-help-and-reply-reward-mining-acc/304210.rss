    <description>Hey Guys, I just have a few Problems.....

Problem 1: After I click Start Server, I try to log on my own server, then it says im already logged in. This is what is says on the Console:
Registering user 10att10 with pass *********
Server: hybridscape Server (2): Exception!
Server: ClientHandler: Client 10att10 disconnected.
[03:21:37] Couldn&#39;t open output stream to log file 10att10-20090925.log
[03:21:37] 
[03:21:37] Logging into (10att10, *****)
[03:21:37] Your UID is: 23176282
Server: ClientHandler: Accepted from 127.0.0.1:49908
Did not save for 10att10
Server: ClientHandler: Client 10att10 disconnected.
.....Thats what it says.....

Problem 2: Okay, so on [b]ANY[/b] Client or Server, ill be able to go on it, move or attack somewhere or something on the server, but when I do it the second time, it crashes and gets out of it....I think it might have something to do with Java.


Thanks Guys.</description>
