              <p>I think software optimisation for the CPU and GPU is a main issue, obviously apps are made exclusively for devices running almost identical hardware with iOS on iPhone, but with android the hardware on each phone is different therefore is more difficult to optimise.  It’s much like the comparison of Xbox360 and PC in terms of hardware, despite the 360 having a GPU which is almost 10 years old, it still runs considerably better than a PC with the same video card because the GPU is only used for gaming and nothing else with the Xbox.  But I agree with what you said.</p>

              <p>I think was in that topic, justifying why Apple is influential in the games industry, but shouldn’t be anywhere near the top.</p>
<p>The iPad 2 and iPhone 4S have a dual core CPU and a very good dual core GPU. The CPU used in a fair amount of other phones, but Apple under clock it on the iPhone down to 800Mhz and on the iPad to 1Ghz. It is clocked much higher on other phones. You see, Apple do a lot of stuff on the GPU, they pretty much do all the UI rendering on the GPU and that is something Android hasn’t had all that well until recently, ICS allows you to force it across the entire system iirc.</p>
<p>The most intensive things we do on phones these days are pretty much, gaming and perhaps a bit of video editing, but mainly gaming. We shouldn’t need these insanely quick CPUs, I mean they should progress but if anything has proven we don’t need these really quick CPUs for the most intensive thing we do on a phone, it is the iPhone.</p>
<p>Just look at the benchmarks, especially the bottom graphics benchmarks.</p>

<p>All those phones are considerably larger than the iPhone, have bigger batteries with more capacity. They should be able to pull out a lead on battery life. Basically, we can afford to slow down the CPU - put better GPUs in them and let them do more of the work when they are in situations when they can do it better. I know the iPhone doesn’t go down particularly well around here, but this approach is one I think could benefit Android phones. I think WP7 is similar to iOS in regards to this approach.</p>
<p>The problem is, Android manufacturers are desperate to differentiate themselves from each other. None of them are really software companies, they can’t make good software, their skins aren’t a real differentiator to the average consumer - they wouldn’t really notice. What they can notice and process though, is big numbers on the spec sheet next to the phone! So that is what they do, they play the spec race. That is the main way they can differentiate themselves - putting faster components into the phones well before the battery tech has caught up.</p>
<p>TL;DR - We don’t need quad core CPUs, the software to properly support the hardware to give the performance hardware manufacturers want to boast about. But that is still unlikely to slow it down because of the need for differentiation. The most intensive thing we do is games, FOCUS ON THE GPUs!</p>

<p>The Nokia N8 and the iPhone 4 have surprisingly good cameras, more than enough for the average joe that wants to take “decent” photos with their phone, totally comparable with dedicated compact point and shoot cameras. If you want to do proper photography, obviously get a DLSR, otherwise there’s nothing wrong with some high end phone cameras.</p>

<p>also the nexus galaxy has some built in feature that doesn’t allow it to get very bright. he had his phone at full brightness and so was mine his was like having mine on half brightness. his phone’s display displays white in every pixel but mine is checkered black and white which you don’t really notice unless you look really hard and know thats is what is happening.

              <p>I’d definitely go as far as to say the new HTC One X is the best phone in the world right now, announced yesterday, featuring a nVidia Tegra 3 quad core processor @ 1.5ghz, 1GB RAM and a resolution of 1280x720.</p>
<p>Not only that but it’s solid and good looking.<br>

              <p>I say the galaxy s2 is the best out atm. i may be biased since i own one but my friend has the nexus galaxy and the only thing his phone has on mine is slightly larger screen, slightly faster processor, ics, and the fast camera. I’m sure ics will help my phone a little when it comes out. even though my camera is slower at taking pics the quality of pictures from my phone are worth it. he may be able to zoom in while recording video in 1080p but it doesnt look very good. even with cyanogenmod on his nexus my phone still had a score about 1000 points higher than his phone in a quadrant benchmark, and my phone is stock.</p>
<p>also the nexus galaxy has some built in feature that doesn’t allow it to get very bright. he had his phone at full brightness and so was mine his was like having mine on half brightness. his phone’s display displays white in every pixel but mine is checkered black and white which you don’t really notice unless you look really hard and know thats is what is happening. I believe it is do to the different display technologies but i like my display.</p>
