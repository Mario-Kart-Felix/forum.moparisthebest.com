    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;You&#39;re wrong, it&#39;s not hard for me to admit I&#39;m wrong.  I can&#39;t help but laugh at how you think you&#39;re proving things, when all you&#39;re doing is using logical fallacies.

You obviously don&#39;t know me, or my style of sarcasm.  It&#39;s generally subtle... (btw I love how often you use logical fallacies)  Furthermore, I have looked at the pros, and cons, but the pros you have provided are not pros at all, and are completely worthless.

Adding a multiplier is not changing the data (read ratio), it&#39;s simply shifting the amount given.  Changing the XP multiplier is perfectly fine, seeing you&#39;re not changing the data/ratio (which I have already said multiple times), additionally, changing the multiplier is easier than changing the data for each action, because you literally change the multiplier, and can scale the amount of xp given.  My argument has never been, &quot;Jagex doesn&#39;t change them, so neither should you.&quot; my argument is that Jagex spent a considerable amount of time calculating the relative difficulty for each action, and assigning them values relative to the others, and they have balanced skills, so that a single action isn&#39;t more advantageous than another for the current state of the skill.

Ok, so you&#39;re doing exactly what I said, making an interface to do this easily...  You can do the exact same thing with the current system (not that it should be done(with either method), but it can be).

Response to side note:  No clue, but it would be modifying the xp multiplier, not the actual data itself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proof was right there in front of you. Go back and look.

Again, you&#39;re trying to change something you said into something else. It&#39;s clear as day. The_AFKer saw it, I see it, I&#39;m sure others see it, yet you deny it. I mean seriously, swallow the pride and just admit that you had every intentions of being sarcastic.

You&#39;re not looking at the bigger picture, which is why you&#39;re rejecting the idea. It is [u]exactly[/u] like your MP3 player ordeal, except I&#39;m trying to explain it to you and you [u]just don&#39;t get it[/u]. Do you not want to admit that it could be an OK idea because of your pride? That would make sense.

Yes, I understand that. Now you understand this; While doing what Jagex has done (as you say, spending a considerable amount of time calculating the relative difficulty for each action), why would you make it any harder on yourself doing these rather long, annoying tasks? It could be easier, which has been my point all along.
You still haven&#39;t fully grasp the point of this. You&#39;re implying that I want to change the EXP mid-game (as I said before), or disrupt the current game EXP and cause an imbalance. No, I want to make it easier setting the EXP and for future skills/tasks. Adding a different interface is great, it doesn&#39;t [u]have[/u] to be SQL. If you can update it on the fly, then great. It still doesn&#39;t take away the impact of my argument. If anything it supports it.</description>
