              <p>well some client have different cache’s (custom caches with items, objects, gfx, etc.)<br>
like are a bunch of client out there:508, 474, 503, 377, 317 and so on and so forth. 377 and 317 can login in, umm how do i say this, can login to either 317 or 377 servers. errr. then from there u need each client to login into a specific server.</p>
