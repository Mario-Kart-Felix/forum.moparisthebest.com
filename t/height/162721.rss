    <title>Height</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/height/162721</link>
    <description>C&#39;mon, this is like the 2nd or 3rd post i&#39;ve made...

Does anyone know the height mask?..

Cause you got the ID mask..

mask100var1 = id; ..

Delay mask?

mask100var2 = delay; ..

Now i need the mask that controls the height, of the variables above..

I&#39;ve tried everything lmao. The stuff like out.writeWord(id);

will NOT work... Thats a completely different GFX..
[code]
out.writeWord(id);
[/code]

Causes that.

Ya ya, don&#39;t get me wrong, that does work... But it creates a completely different GFX, and it&#39;s not facing.

So you have one thats facing south, with the applied height.

And the facing gfx, at the set height.

I need something, that lets me control height of the following..
[code]
mask100var1 = id;
mask100var2 = delay;
[/code]

And the only thing that might, is a mask... 

So please.. Anyone know it?

Many thanks..</description>
