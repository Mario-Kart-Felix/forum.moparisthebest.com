    <description>Hey guys,

Ive been interacted with too many bullshit. 1st Some moron keeps trying to Spam his Server out, worst i can do is Mute\Ban Him. Then sit back and ban his other Accounts untill either one of us gets bored. As you know 562s don&#39;t have IP Bann\IP Mute unless their Coders have Coded it in. I got all the Codes needed, but when i Compile, i have 7 Erroes (Can&#39;t be bothered loading them in because i want an experienced Coder. If you Code me in a 110% PROPER WORKING IP Ban and IP Mute i [b]WILL[/b] pay you $$$ Via PayPal.

No Scam Either, So don&#39;t F##k me around and i won&#39;t F##K you around.

Add me on msn: Skilluhpkh@hotmail.com

Glad to hear from you, if you do add me. Cheers.</description>
