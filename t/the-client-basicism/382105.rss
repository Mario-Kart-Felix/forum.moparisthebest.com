    <title>The Client Basicism?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-client-basicism/382105</link>
    <description>Ok, I have a v16 client for deltascape, but the run.bat doesn&#39;t seem to be working. It pops up then goes away quickly. I believe it is saying that the main class doesn&#39;t work. I know this to mean my path isn&#39;t set properly; however, upon looking at my environmental variables, they are set correctly. Plus, the run.bat file only has the following:

@ECHO OFF
Legendzz Client V2
JAVA -Xmx500m EGUI

so what do I need to do to make this work? Post links if allready discussed.
