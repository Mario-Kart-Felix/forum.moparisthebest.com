    <description>I was reading a thread before of people whining about RSCE and how it cant last a day of uptime etc..

From a regular players view like my self, it really does not matter? if someone implemented a good, decent auto server restarter that worked every 12 hours, had 1 minute downtime or so.. i would be fine playing a server like that.

having to deal with 1 restart that gives you 1 minute of downtime per day, is a good price to pay to ensure the rest of your play time is going to be &#39;fresh&#39; without lag and no rollbacks etc.

be happy that you guys have access to a server source that&#39;s say 85% complete and can handle 500+ players for a MINIMUM of 12h. that&#39;s pretty decent for a bunch of unpaid community programmers.

just like a computer, i would rather turn off my computer per day and turn it on the next day, instead of leaving it on 24-7, not only for the power, but for the freshness you get when you first turn your PC on. having a computer left on for a week is slower than from the moment you turn it on, period. (inb4 linux fanboys)

Why are we dissing each others code for who can&#39;t provide weeks of stability running hundreds of players? we are unpaid programmers by hobbie who find spare time to whip this shit up, not exactly working for jagex getting paid full time hiring in some of the worlds best programmers and analysts to make sure a servers going to last weeks.

to me, Stability is making sure you don&#39;t have dupes, making sure you don&#39;t have CPU spikes by having other applications raping your CPU now and then. making sure you don&#39;t have code that&#39;s going to crash the server, and most of all, prevent from DoS in your game servers code, and overall DDoS.

[b]THE PROCEDURE TO MAINTAIN HIGH STABILITY[/b]

- I&#39;d like all of the community to give some input on these steps to help people ensure they have the highest stability they can get. If you skip a step, it could bite you in the ass down the track.


1. Server hardware (fast dual core, 2gb ram at least, good upstream connection) 
 - something dedicated will always be better than a VPS. if your on a VPS and your server is lagging at times, since it&#39;s shared resources it could be that your network or cpu bandwidth are getting raped.
 - since RSCA/RSCD has a single threaded game engine, it will hardly benefit from using more than 1 core. in some server packages you get the choice of a fast dual core of a medium quad, go with the fast dual core. (e.g 3.3ghz dual beats a 2.6 quad)

2. DDoS protection (optional at first) 
 - can be quite expensive and possibly unnecessary until needed, see how you go with none, you may need this down the line though.

3. Software setup - configure it correctly too
 - XAMPP, WAMP etc can also have SQL security flaws if you don&#39;t set this up properly, i can&#39;t give help on this though.
 - get some resource monitor programs and monitor your system, make sure it&#39;s healthy. the less software you have on your server the less chance things can interfere with your stability.

4. Auto restarter that can restart the server safely every 12h
 - don&#39;t rely on your self to reboot it when you think it needs one


At this point your all ready, the only thing that&#39;s going to get in your way is DoS. people modifying their client to send invalid data which could possibly crash your server.
This is where RSCA needs to be optimized from crash attacks, as well as packet flooding. some people should work together to purposely attack your own server locally and record where things can go wrong, usually very easy fixes.


if anyone has input on above, feel free to share</description>

I never said they didn’t need to evolve together.  I was simply saying you can throw better hardware at it and get more out of it; if you looked at how much memory  a server needs for only 1,000 players and compare that to how much it needs for only 100 players you’ll realize that it won’t scale with just hardware.

<p>That’s because they shouldn’t be sending (multiple) entire chunks to every client all the time, they should do it in a decent way and send only what the client(s) should be able to see at the given time.

<p>You’d be receiving much more data over time, and the computations to determine what is visible aren’t cheap…</p>
<p>Sending chunks then updating them is fine, it’s just the way they’re managed…</p>
<p>Having all the chunks in the entire world loaded into memory at all times is completely retarded.  I believe he also has a copy of each chunk a player has loaded rather than updating players in regions.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can go on all day about this, but it’s really not relevant to the main point.</p>
<p>Minecraft is much more difficult, but deals with those difficulties in a much worse way.</p>

              <p>It looks like the server hosting those players is about to melt.</p>
<p>If a Linux VM was set up the way xEnt would like and distributed, it would have to be used on a dedicated server. A VPS would not work as Xzibit Yo Dawg memes would dribble out of the server. I have never set up a Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) but as long as the hosting company is not already running one on your dedicated server, then it should work pretty well. The problem is that most “dedicated server” hosts are already running KVM on the servers so that you can (in minutes) reload it to a new Linux distribution without them having to manually set it up for you. A VM inside a VM can slow down a machine considerably from what I have read. If you were full of money and serious about it, colocation would be an option but for RSC private servers, something else would need to be done. If we did not have to worry about DDoS attacks on public servers, then xEnt’s idea would be perfect for running inside Virtualbox on a home PC.</p>
<p>"KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko. KVM also requires a modified QEMU although work is underway to get the required changes upstream.</p>
<p>Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc."</p>
<p>It is also available as a patch for recent Linux kernel versions and as an external module that can be used with your favorite distro- provided kernel going back up to 2.6.16, therefore including all latest versions for Enterprise Linux Distributions.</p>
<p>Working:<br>
Intel-based hosts (requires VT capable processors)<br>
AMD-based hosts (requires SVM capable processors)<br>
Windows/Linux/Unix guests (32-bit and 64-bit)"</p>

<p>Notch was using 2-3 threads per connection, and the way he did everything was completely retarded.</p>
<p>I’d honestly love to see the specs of the machine that’s holding 3k people…  I’m pretty sure he’s still using 2 threads per client, which means the server is handling 6k threads just for the networking.  The context switching is going to cause a massive overhead.</p>
