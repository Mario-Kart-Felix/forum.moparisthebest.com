    <description>[b]Problem: [/b]  how to send more than one line of text to 1 interface

[b]Server Base:[/b]  highly mod. hybridscape

[b]Rating:[/b]  6

here is the link to my previous, still unanswered, hard problem http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,47384.0.html

this problem is related, in that i found a new problem while filling out the text on the interfaces.  some texts have more than one line of text, but on the interface every line only has one line, and it&#39;s double spaced, and no other interface is the line 2, etc.  for instance the ranged - bows, skill guide, has ammo - up to rune, under magic bow.  not double spaced.  like right under that, but i can&#39;t seem to figure out how to get it down there, since it obviously doesn&#39;t word wrap.  so my thinking is that either there is so other interface that i send that will allow me to have 2nd lines, or somehow use a different frame than sendframe126 to send the text, that will put 2 lines.  

on npc dialogue, there is different interfaces, that has different locations of text, double spaced, single spaced, different amounts of lines, etc.  wonder if there is somehow a different interface that lays over the skill guide interface that has different interface numbers for the text.  

or

if there is a sendframeX(string str, string str2, int id) so u can send more than one line of text...where X is the other frame number.
