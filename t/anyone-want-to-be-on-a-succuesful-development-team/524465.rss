    <title>Anyone want to be on a succuesful development team?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-want-to-be-on-a-succuesful-development-team/524465</link>
    <description>Was actually just wondering if anyone would like to be on a succesful development team I have 3 years + experience I code everyday frequently some are snippets some are my own codes.  I have a 2006 project with 1.5 years of work no one has seen it yet going to release when I feel it is time to release.  Other then that hope to find someone soon.  Wish you all luck as well.  

Thanks,
Demolition

lmao it’s a typo calm down buddy.  Also no one has ever seen my 2006 remake but I have not seen anything like it around thats for sure 2 different worlds.  One for f2p and one for p2p.  It has everything that was in 2006.  All the skills are idenitical to rs.  I will not release it just yet.  I haven’t released it nowhere no one has ever seen it before either.  Only thing you can really see is some codes I have thrown together I guess.  Simple but easy just made a staff list today for my server so when someone does ::stafflist it pops out into a interface like a little book sorta.  Nothing spectatucular just a few minutes of a code<br>

<p>Watching a painter paint or a poet write does nothing for me. It’s the end product that speaks towards their ability. What are some major features that you’ve developed in your 2006 project? Show a video of them in action. Have you come up with more efficient solutions to issues that other developers have had in the past? That will speak volumes.</p>
