    <description>Wether you know this or not, biometric authentication is what Jagex uses to shoot us down. If Jagex uses this technique, we can counter it.

http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/faculty/pollett/masters/Semesters/Spring04/Shivani/CS297Report.pdf

This is an interesting document on the subject, it isn&#39;t directly related to our situation in runescape, but it&#39;s a start to further understand biometric authentication.

Jagex obviously uses biometrics to authenticate our automated mouse movements. However after my small research I came to the conclusion that their authentication methods are not as powerful as we think, nor as accurate. We&#39;re just ignorant enough to fall into their simple traps.

Thoughts and feedback?</description>

              <p>Yeah, I was thinking about this too. I made an applet an recorded my movements to some points, and then (instead of moving the mouse) made my algorithm draw little suares at each mouse movement. The thing is, people move VERY different. There are hundreds of thousands that play rs, so there wont be anything decent that can happen in 64mb.</p>
<p>I have been thinking on how they would figure out if people are autoing and came up with(just like every1 else has) the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can measure the distance of the mouse jumps</li>
<li>They can record a few mouse movements and compare their actual slope, and if the slopes are similar, then it is nothing more than a large jump being chopped up into lots of little jumps</li>
<li>They can measure the x-dist and y-dist of every mouse movement, if there are movements too similar, then it is a possibility as being a bot, and if it keeps on happening, it will be considered a bot.</li>
</ol>
<p>those are the obvious things, but i havent really gone any further into it. what i have tested (not used, i dont like cheating, i just like being able to <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) is this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void moveSlow(int x2, int y2)
{
    int dx = x2-xpos;
    int dy = y2-ypos;
    double dist = Math.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy);

        normal(dx, dy, x2, y2, 2000, 50);
    }else if(Math.abs(dx) &gt; 2)
    {
        normal(dx, dy, x2, y2, 500, 100);

        y2 += 4;
        dx = x2-xpos;
        dy = y2-ypos;
        normal(dx, dy, x2, y2, 500, 100);
    }
}
private void normal(int dx, int dy, int nx, int ny, int random, int chops)
{
    double upto = Math.abs(dx);
    double inc = upto / chops;
    double ntd = Math.PI / 2;
    boolean xp = dx &gt; 0 ? true : false;
    boolean yp = dy &gt; 0 ? true : false;
    int neg = dx &gt; 0 ? 1 : -1;
    for(double i = 0; i &lt; upto; i += inc + rand.nextInt(random) / 1000.)
    {
        int newX = 0, newY = 0;
        
        if(xp){
            newX = (int)(xpos + i);
        }else newX = (int)(xpos - i);
        
        if(yp &amp;&amp; xp)
        {
            newY = (int)( ypos + dy * Math.sin(ntd * (i/upto)) );
        }else if(!yp &amp;&amp; xp)
        {
            newY = (int)( ypos + dy * Math.sin(ntd * (i/upto)) );

        }
        move(newX, newY, false);
        sleep(rand.nextInt(10) + 5);
    }
    xpos = nx;
    ypos = ny;
}</code></pre>
<p>it is pretty simple, and follows a sin pattern from either 0 to pi/2 or 0 to -pi/2</p>
<p>inside the moveslow method, there are different if statements because with the normal method, if the two points you are moving to and from are too far apart, and you use the same parameters for the movement if the points are close, the mouse will jump further than needed.</p>
<p>im not sure if SCAR uses anything like this, as i have never used it, but this is what i made.</p>
<p>it isnt really human-like, but it isnt just a “jump” and the only rule that could catch it from the above ones would be the x-distance movements because, although still random, they are usually within 1-2 pixels of each other, this is what the random parameter for normal is though. It increases the x position by a set increment + any floating point number between 0 and (random/1000)</p>
<p>edit: if you think this would be caught by any of jagex’s other methods detecting movement, tell me and i will try to change it</p>
<p>edit: i edited after the code some…</p>

You basically create an algorithm that mimics these mouse movements.  From what we’ve been doing, we basically just attempted to create something that looked human, keyword: looked.  Although most of the stuff we have looks impressive, I can’t say that my mouse moves like that when I have control of it.[/quote]</p>

<p>May come as a shock, but they <span class="bbcode-i">already knew</span> how bots worked before Aryan was released.<br>
Actually, it was the bot’s users who caused themselves to be banned - release does not compel people to use a program.</p>
