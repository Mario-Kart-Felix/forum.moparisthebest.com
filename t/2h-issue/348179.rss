    <title>2h issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2h-issue/348179</link>
    <description>Hello, I don&#39;t know if this should be client or server sided, so I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m in the wrong section.
I just added a 2handed custom to my server. I&#39;ve added it into the statement that I use for all my godswords. And the attack emote, etc. works, but the sword is still in the position as if it was a 1hander. I&#39;ve never had to work with this issue because I&#39;ve never encountered it, help will be appreciated.
