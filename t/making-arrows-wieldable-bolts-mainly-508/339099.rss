    <title>Making arrows wieldable, bolts mainly 508+</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-arrows-wieldable-bolts-mainly-508/339099</link>
    <description>How can I make diamond bolts (e) and ruby bolts (e) weldable, with my source I can wield dbolts and dbolts (e) and all the arrows but just not those diamond bolts and stuff, I just want to know how, would that be in the source or client. Because when you click on them they do nothing but sit in your inventory, so even if you only know for 317 or any source, any information would be super helpful!!! Please reply back! Thank you, and no I hate when people ask what source is it and never reply back, so don&#39;t ask just tell me the answer, for any source or any client and I will try to figure it out!!!!</description>

              <p>This is very easy depending on what base you have.<br>
I’m going to tell you what works for palidino76, davidscape and bubly and maybe others to.</p>
<p>You go to Src -&gt; palidino76 -&gt; rs2 -&gt; io -&gt; packets</p>
<p>Open up equipment.java find the one that says private String[] arrows</p>
<p>Just add in your item exact full name at the end like this for example…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">,"Dragon bolts"</code></pre>
<p>You could also just put in “bolts” and “arrows” and see if that makes all of them work. Any errors let me know and i will fix.</p>
