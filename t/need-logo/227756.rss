    <description>Hello Well Im looking for a logo for my site runefantasy,

Here is a bit of info as to what im looking for

I want it to look attractive and what not,

[b]If possible have a mirror effect[/b]

I want it like classic and stuff so like knights, swords castles etc...

The Text should be pretty simple, I want it to say RuneFantasy - Please no glow and no animated effect

I will hope to see some renders of knights or things that have to do with a castle theme- not halo knight or call of duty soldier- a knight like a knight with shiny armor- maybe a castle in the background

The size should be not to big and not to small [so not a massive half a page logo like runegamers or not like moparisthebest&#39;s so lets say a reasonable &#39;logo&#39; size

Thanks i look foward to see some people art works

              <p>Please, just state a logo size, because it can vary where you want it placed. Also, if you could find the image links, it would be of great assistance.</p>
