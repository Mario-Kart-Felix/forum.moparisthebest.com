    <description>hey,

My problem begins with a few commands i&#39;ve been making. Basics for servers, you know, ::guide, ::rules, and ::commands.
Anyway, I have these two items, their actually book-like objects, and I need to know how to make them open my ::guide or ::rules. So when i click &quot;read&quot; i wan&#39;t it to pop up and say &quot;Welcome to **scape! Here are the rules!&quot; or something like that. I don&#39;t see very many help questions answered here so i think this might be a waste of time, but if you could help me out, that&#39;d be great.</description>
