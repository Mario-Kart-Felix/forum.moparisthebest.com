    <title>Problem with &quot;You cannot tele above Y 3712 wildy.&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-you-cannot-tele-above-y-3712-wildy/70993</link>
    <description>Well me and my old friend were working on a tutorial and it worked, it was the one that when you ::noclip you get sent to the ship and you can&#39;t leave...

Well now when your in the wildy you can&#39;t leave, with a command or emote or regular teleport.  Now what?  Is there a way so my ship stays the same but you can tele out of the wildy?

Thank you,

~Liamsford
