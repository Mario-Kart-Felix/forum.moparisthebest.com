    <title>How to Hide/Unhide Files [My Way]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-hide-unhide-files-my-way/354150</link>
    <description>Hello, this is my tutorial on how to unhide files in a client or source. It should work for both. Im not sure if this is allowed, if not just let me know and ill have a moderator delete it.

Difficulty - 1/10

Files changed - None except for folder name

UnHide files:

Open your client/source that has the files hidden and right click anywhere [Not on an icon] and click Properties. Then at the very top rename it to whatever [Temporary] and Check off &quot;Hidden&quot; then click OK and if it shows up, check off &quot;For all Folders&quot;

Then simply repeat the process but this time, uncheck &quot;Hidden&quot; and all the files should show up.


Hide

Open your Client/source that you want to hide the files on and Move your Run.bat to your desktop or another folder [Temporary]. Then right click anywhere [Not an icon] and click Properties. At the very top, type in any name and check off &quot;Hidden&quot;. Then press OK and if it shows up, Check off &quot;For All Files&quot;.

Then simply put your Run.bat back into the folder and it should work.

Any errors i made please correct me. Hope this helped!</description>

              <p>Thanks, but it can help people if they download a client and files are hidden. So it is related in my opinion.</p>
