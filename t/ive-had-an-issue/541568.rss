    <title>Ive Had an issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ive-had-an-issue/541568</link>
    <description>Ok well months ago we had to buy a new vps this was in around early January late December and we were down for around an hour or two and we got down to 97% uptime , now months later never going offline unless for an update which takes 2 seconds. It has been 99% , I was wondering if it could be 100% it would greatly increase the amount of players coming into are server. If you are able to do so I thank you.

Currently the only way to get up to 100% again is via rounding error, because this keeps track of your uptime over all time.</p>
<p>In the near future, I plan on allowing you to pick a time period to see uptime over, and then the default can be set to 6 months or 1 year or something allowing you to get back up to 100%.<br>

<p>I stopped hosting for 8 months, and was left unable to remove my server from the toplist… and I’ve just come back to it all and i know the only way to of got around this would be to make a new account; but i don’t feel i should need to… My server is now stuck with a low up-time, I’ve revamped the listing however I’m certain I can keep it above 98% like before… Any solution at all? I’d be willing to lose all my votes if i can get the listing reset (or ability to make a new listing, with the old one deleted)</p>
<p>p.s this also means I shouldn’t be eligible here I think… under a certain uptime :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Until I implement the above, the only solution would be to ask me to delete it.  I have now done so. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

As of now you don’t have many options sadly…</p>
<p>A. You can point your advertisement to an IP &amp; port that aren’t being used. Your server will appear offline and when the uptime reaches 40% it is automatically removed from the MoparScape Server Status Page. At that time you can register your server once again.<br>
B. You can maintain uptime and when your uptime hits 99.5% the Server Status Page will turn it in to 100% once again.</p>
<p>Posting a new advertisement for an existing server is against the rules. Nothing else you can do without breaking rules I’m afraid.</p>
