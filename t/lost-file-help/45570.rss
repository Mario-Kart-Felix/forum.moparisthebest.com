              <p>Depends where you what you were using to download.  Many browsers would just delete the temporary file if the transmission was interrupted (but if your computer shut down with warning it may not have).  Resuming downloads depends entirely on the download client and server though.  If you were using a browser, I’d say you probably will have to restart the download.  Take a look for a download manager, as they will typically allow pausing and resuming downloads.</p>
