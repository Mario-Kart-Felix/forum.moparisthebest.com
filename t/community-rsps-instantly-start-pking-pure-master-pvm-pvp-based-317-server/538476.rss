Important info for pvmers/pvpers: Most of the profitable npcs are in wildy not counting big bosses. This should increase pkers as most of the advanced pvmers should be in the wilderness either farming vesta,ganodermic,polypore or just simply doing the mage bank minigame.
Our Forums: No forums atm.

Client download link:https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/124175485/Client%20%2B%20Cache.zip
Follow the instructions on the txt file to play the server.

For a webclient link to this server go to this link: Note this; the webclient dosent load my cache which means you cant see custom items.
http://www.rswebclients.com/client/Community%20Rsps

Community-rsps has been running for about 4months and i believe its the most advanced 317 out there on rsw, what makes it so unique and advanced? Read and watch the video..

Free for all events
Added ffa into the server so whenever there are many people that are pking i can turn ffa on and people will have way more fun pking.

Ingame Highscores
for those people that like to train to become the best.
Advanced econemy, and im serious, the eco is just sick compared to any other server, just picture this: ags is 10mil to the general store and that is the item with the most value, so yeah... 
But that dosent make its harder to make money, it only depends if you dont know anything about a rsps or not.
