Hello, i am continuing with &quot;Ardour&quot; and have recently started work with the base of &quot;Lost Legacy&quot;.

I need some people which would be dedicated to giving what the players want. 

If you have any skills which you think would be a value to the server please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me via my skype:
