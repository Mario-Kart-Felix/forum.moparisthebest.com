              <p>i do agree with the optimal organizing of the source files but im use to the old “server folder” - “client.java” not “server folder” - “scr” - “folder” - “client.java” lol but i have looked over the rs2 protocol and i have looked and dled free pdfs on java but for me its not sinking in for working with the rsps i know its all java but from all the tuts on java and rsps and minecraft i have used and worked with all the code seems to differ with game to tut so im trying my best to learn as i go i know its probably the hardest and stupidest way about doing it but thats just me</p>

              <p>Packaging makes no difference on how hard a server is to programing.</p>
<p>Think of packaging as a organized way to have all your file in one folder. The one folder being src, and then all your classes should be organized in a way that makes thing easy to find, but is also informative enough that a person that hasn’t programed it will be able to figure it out.</p>
<p>If I may suggest, you should read more on the basics of Java and also the rs2 protocol it will help you greatly in creating anything you wish in your server.</p>

              <p>hm idk i know this base is very messy i may rid of it for another what i was going to do with it was a basic remake but not a public remake but just a lan type thing with like 5-6 friends and thought delta would be pretty easy to use but im finding out its pretty crappy i have used devo longgg time ago and coded it with ease but i cant find a good unpacked devo and suggestions on ether a new source or trying to fix this problem</p>
<p>if it is the fact of mopars client loading the headicons defferent then i guess i could work around it but i have looked up uid adding and removed what they wanted added in server still nothing i have also removed lol almost all the login code and still wont connect the source i have has the uid rsa and encryption im not sure about any of it</p>
