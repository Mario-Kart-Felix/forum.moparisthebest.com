              <p>so i have been to the router page many times btw im using lynksys so I dont see a portforwarding tab but if your talking about the one under applications and gaming then im there but i dont see add a service but watever and I have seen my ip i think the external is 99.10.252.** but when i go to the portforwarding page it has the internal ip the 192.168.<em>.</em>** and when i got to check if my ports open it always checks with my external idk if this matters or not just thought id let you know and yes i have teamviewer but im not a big fan of random people looking at our entire router system so idk if thats an option for me</p>

              <p>Go to: <a href="http://192.168.1.1/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://192.168.1.1/</a></p>
<p>Login, the common user is “admin”, the common password is “password”</p>
<p>Navigate to portforwarding tab.</p>
<p>Hit ‘Add a Service’</p>
<p>For name put w/e, I suggest RSPS.<br>
Make it TCP/UDP for Starting Type<br>
Starting Port: 43594<br>
Ending Port: 43594</p>
<p>Lastly the Server IP Address can be obtained from opening command prompt and typing in “ipconfig”<br>
It will usually be your IPv4 Address</p>
<p>Tell me if this helps.</p>
