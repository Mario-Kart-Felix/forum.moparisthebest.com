              <p>Zammyking111, it looks as though you completely deserved you mute. You are the kind of person who ruins RS, the kind of person who acts like a dick to other people.</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised that you are muted. End of thread.</p>
<p>Oh and by the way; You say Jagex needs to get over “little kids little kids”, well you act like a kid so don’t be so surprised.</p>

              <p>Its not as simple as that, they could face alot bad publicity as Sony and Microsoft did due online abuse on their online networks. So if jagex got this type of publicity ‘Child suffers abuse from online game’, parents would try to stop their children playing the game once they recognized it, would stop paying for memberships and such and could face legal troubles which can lead to fines and such. There are many kids that don’t take alot of the stuff people say to heart but all it takes is one complaint that gets taken to the media and thats it.</p>

              <p>“because u have no friends”, “go cut urself”, etc etc. Its not offensive to us but as 10 year olds play that game jagex have to take it seriously. What you said could be classed as abusive/offensive language on any game thats played by younger kids.</p>
