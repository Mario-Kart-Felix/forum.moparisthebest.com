    <title>[HELP] How to loop in a rsps and how to temporary increase a players strenth bon</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-how-to-loop-in-a-rsps-and-how-to-temporary-increase-a-players-strenth-bon/552691</link>
    <description>Ok so I was wondering how to make something loop? In specfic I am trying to check if a player is in a certain zone or not. Also Im trying to make it so that when you teleport to said zone the players strength bonus is multiplied by x10 so if you str was 200 it&#39;d be  2000 but I also need a way so that when they leave there strenth is reset but im not sure how to go about doing this.  Ive tried googling but cant find anything. Any help would be great!  Pi - 317
EDIT:Also does anyone have a real good tut on item - recolouring for itemdef  only ones i can find are for class8 and Does anyone know how to increase the level cap so instead of 99 it could be like 125 or something like that? Also is there anyway I can recolour an object? (sorry for all the questions  :eek: )</description>

              <ol>
<li>For the area check</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: taking directly from my guide on R-S</p>
<p>Somewhere in your walking packet put this</p>
<p><code>if (!c.inDonatorzone() &amp;&amp; c.isDonator == 0) {
		c.getPA().movePlayer(2539, 3091, 0);
		c.sendMessage("This is a donator only zone!");
	    }</code></p>
<p>In your player file add this</p>
<p><code>public boolean inDonatorzone() {
	if ((absX &gt;= 2502 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2532 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3070 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3105)) {
	    return false;
	}
	return true;
 }</code></p>

<ol start="2">
<li>For the strength part you will have to do a little of your own research as I don’t know the methods for 317 anymore. But essentially you would make a config for it if you don’t have one already.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then wherever it is listed search for something such as this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This is your general idea right here you will need to do research on. Make your own  config for strength if you need to.</p>
<p>Then in your walking packet again you need to add this config. You should also keep in mind that to reset it you will need to go to wherever your teleports are at  and  have it  it to set  the config back to regular.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Real simple if i remember right</li>
</ol>
<p><code>itemDef.originalModelColors[0] = 528;
			itemDef.modifiedModelColors[0] = 100;</code></p>
<p>You just change the modified value to whatever you want?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Just guessing here but I would assume in this</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Same as itemDef you will go to objectDef and change the colors there.</li>
</ol>
