    <description>Can someone please make a runescape classic private server that actually can code and has a sense of what there doing, Pyru is a fudgeing idiot and is a terrible admin. Rscrevolution is ok but the experience rates are to fudgeing low no1 wants these low xp rates anymore except for a select few.

If you can&#39;t make the client usable windows and mac please don&#39;t even attempt to make a private server.</description>

              <p>Yes, I could, time permitting. I do IT and software development professionally, so the skill set is there. But again, it’s draining to spend 38 hours in an office and then have people expecting you to put however many other hours into something like this, week in week out. I don’t think you guys appreciate the reality of your expectations.</p>
<p>And since experience multipliers have been mentioned, I’ll quote a post I made elsewhere:</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:2, topic:546332”]To be honest, the best approach would actually be to allow people to configure their accounts for certain competitive events in a ‘competitive’ game context.</p>
<p>For example, consider something like Castle Wars (capture the flag) in the current game. Wouldn’t it be good if it had a competitive mode where everyone could play with maximised stats or an account configured to their liking? Free equipment, free runes, free items.<br>
The same goes for the other competitive PvP parts of the game.</p>
<p>The trick is to strictly separate your game contexts. Winnings from features in the competitive context (e.g.: Castle Wars in this case) should only be accessible in the competitive context. They shouldn’t become a part of the player’s bank in the ‘regular’ context. So you can award some cool items for achievement in the competitive context and still insulate the regular game from these items (that is, you stop these items affecting the regular economy and PvP etc).<br>
As a result you can have a relatively low experience rate in the ‘regular’ context while still allowing immediate access to ‘competitive’ context gameplay.</p>
<p>Oh, and you can extend this concept to wilderness PvP. For example, you could let people change their context once per hour. When in the wilderness only regular context people can see other regular context people, and competitive context people can only see competitive context people. You could also do this with F2P and P2P - have a P2p context which allows p2p pking on the same world as f2p pking without them affecting each other.[/quote]</p>
<p>More generally, you could have different contexts for people who want different things. Some players want to have F2P pking only? You have two wilderness contexts: one for F2P, one for P2P.<br>
You could even maintain a ‘fun mode’ context where people can do things like PK with whatever items and stats they want. You simply make sure that boundaries between contexts are enforced. In other words, in a server with a ‘fun mode’ context and a regular context, each player would have a separate bank and stats for each context.</p>
<p>I think this approach would be the real trick to attracting many players to a single server.</p>

Would you be able to provide a proper working server, with updates to get the server working efficiently? If you made it 4-5x, even with just the base RSC working properly, I bet you’d suck this entire community into your server.</p>
