    <title>How would I go about adding some items?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-go-about-adding-some-items/298280</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve found some black white, red, purple, green, and blue trim armour whilst fiddling around with my Item IDs. (Yay clue scrolls and caskets..)

I was wondering on how I would make them actually, like, work. Not being weapon-equip items, and equip to their appropriate spots.

Also, do I need to add them into Item.cfg? ^^&quot;</description>
