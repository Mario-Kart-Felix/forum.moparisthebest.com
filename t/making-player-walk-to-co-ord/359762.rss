    <title>Making player walk to co-ord</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-player-walk-to-co-ord/359762</link>
    <description>Yeah, I&#39;ve been searching around multiple forums for hours trying to find a fix to this.

I&#39;ve been trying to make it so that if a player clicks on a ladder, they have to be in a certain spot... If they&#39;re not then to make them walk to that spot.

This is my attempt so far.

[code]				} else if (objectID == 11740) {
					if (isNextTo(2954, 3388) == true) {
						setAnimation(828);
						toX = absX;
						toY = absY;
						heightLevel = 1;
						break;
					} else {
						walkTo(2954, 3388);
						heightLevel = 1; // Ladder Down
						break;
					}[/code]

Error given:
Logs me out and then teleports me straight up without moving me.
After looking around at several forums, I&#39;ve discovered that the walkTo method is used for NPCs.

I&#39;ve yet to find the method for making a player walk to a co-ordinate.

If I have to code it myself, that&#39;s fine as well. I just need to know where to start.</description>
