    <title>[PI/Exion] Runescape Logo</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-exion-runescape-logo/359504</link>
    <description>I read a tutorial a while back, and it told me to // something in the client.java file in order to actually remove the logo, now I want it to come back. ( I believe it was client.java )

I have no idea where the tutorial went, and I can&#39;t figure out what it was. I am now trying to edit the title and replace it with my own but it doesn&#39;t make any difference until it allows it to show up. I think it looked something like //drawsprite or something.

I was just wondering if any of you know what it might be</description>
