I have explained that part a few times and i thought you would have figured this out by now. Honestly your oppinion means nothing to me but the shear fact that you where incorrect in what you said was the only reason i commented. You think just because i disagree with what you said makes me wrong and it doesnt. You are just stuck up because you think you know everything about graphics. I can see where you say that the effects are over powering on the left and then leed in to negative space on the right. I will say this one more time in hopes that you will understand what I’m saying to you: I DID IT BECAUSE IT MATCHES THE OVERALL EFFECT I WAS GOING FOR.</p>
<p>I take critism well and actually improve from what i learn maybe you should take notes <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Exe i swear your mentally retarded. Like i said the render does go with the effects you would just have to have seen the show to know this. I have explained that part a few times and i thought you would have figured this out by now. Honestly your oppinion means nothing to me but the shear fact that you where incorrect in what you said was the only reason i commented. You think just because i disagree with what you said makes me wrong and it doesnt. You are just stuck up because you think you know everything about graphics. I can see where you say that the effects are over powering on the left and then leed in to negative space on the right. I will say this one more time in hopes that you will understand what I’m saying to you: I DID IT BECAUSE IT MATCHES THE OVERALL EFFECT I WAS GOING FOR.</p>

Its called difference of taste. I have actually improve my self drematically from learning off of what people have told me and if you new anything about what my graphic was supposed to be you wouldnt be so blind as to say the effects dont fit. They fit perfectally.[/quote]This post is funny. Exe loves e-drama. You’re still doing exactly what I said you were awhile ago. You think if anybody speaks down to this ugly shit, they’re instantly wrong. I don’t need to know anything about graphical design to tell you this thing is ugly. The only real reason you think what I’ve said is incorrect is because after hearing the other incompetent rednecks of the forum say “u r gud @ gfx”, you believe any negative is wrong.</p>
<p>The ignorance in your post is also irritating. “They fit perfectly”. How? Tell me how they fit? All the effects push down and to the right, then on the right side of the image, it’s completly calm. The render is hardly doing what the effects are attempting. Just look at the render, it’s suggesting what’s in the picture is pulling up or pushing down, nothing is suggesting a bipolar background.</p>
<p>The render is also still overly contrasted. The choppy-ness from so much color changing has completly ruined that render. Now look at the bottom, it’s blurry. Why is that the only blurry piece of the image, when everything else is pushed further away? What about the text? It’s almost invisible. It’s hidden in the corner. It draws from the image as much as the render dose. Look at the sword, it sticks out like a sore thumb. It just doesn’t fit there.</p>
<p>Now, shut the fuck up.</p>
