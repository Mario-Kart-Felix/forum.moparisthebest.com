    <title>Others can&#39;t log in - Connecting to update server</title>

    <description>Hi guys, 

My friend and I are trying to run a 508. I downloaded all the things I needed. However, everytime he tries to connect to my server, he always get that &quot;Connecting to update server&quot; error. 

I&#39;m sure you guys already had that error before. If you know how to fix it, please tell me. I really need to know. If we didnt&#39; tried 100 times to run a 508 server, we didn&#39;t tried once. 

I&#39;ve done it before, but we just gave up after a while. But now we want to start all over again with a different source.

Okay well, any help as soon as possible would be much appreciated.</description>

<p>Thanks for the reply, hope you can help me.</p>
<p>Okay, he’s using this client. <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,345782.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,345782.0.html</a></p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s berky’s client or whatever. The error is just that it loads like half way, then it stops to “Connecting to update server”.</p>
<p>Also, I’m using Berky-Scape for the source.</p>
