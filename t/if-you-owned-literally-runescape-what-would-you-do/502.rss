    <title>If you Owned (literally) Runescape what would you do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-you-owned-literally-runescape-what-would-you-do/502</link>
    <description>Let&#39;s say you won the lottery (yeah right, fat chance of that eh?) and you found out that runescape is up for sell for lets say $500,000 - $1,000,000 (just making up a price). So you buy it. What would you do to/for runescape and its players???


The first thing i would do is unban all my friends characters and take bribes to unban some other people&#39;s characters (maybe you!!  :eek: ). Then i would make a low scores rank  :cool:. Then i would delete the skills firemaking &amp; farming (&lt; gayest skill ever!). I would change Castlewars to where the people can&#39;t get their own flag (its annoying as hell , Yes?). I would make another castle wars for players under level 75. I would take away some randoms like sandwich lady (omfg major slutbag) and Miles,Giles &amp; Niles (Not sure their names), and the pirate guy. I would make it where the staff [b]actually[/b] read the freaking unban letters. I would randomly pick people every month for free membership, but they have to play runescape more then 2 times and week. I would add randoms that gave away better prizes (ex: random that gives away 15k, and dragon longs). I would take away the adds on free worlds, or i would atleast make them where they dont load when your playing runescape. Because i have had an add load when i was in wild and omfg.... I would add things to the minigames, like you can stake stuff to play against someone in chess, or any of the board games. I would also ban all the current player mods (damn bitches)

Thats all i can think of for right now.</description>
