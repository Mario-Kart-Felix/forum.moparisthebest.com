    <title>A long explanation of every DeltaScape Configuration files</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-long-explanation-of-every-deltascape-configuration-files/365035</link>
    <description>              Please rate me on my explanation, things i needed to add, and if i did good! Say how you feel, its your opinion and i respect it, i wont fight back to senseless firebombs

So i dont think ive seen a cfg explanation for delta, and if there is one, dont think im leeching this, i made this to the best of my knowledge, the community has given me alot, so i am going to try and give some back with my first tutorial! :DDDD
[size=36pt]DELTA SCAPE CFG FILES[/size]

                          NPC DROP
now when you open your npcdrops.cfg, you should be confronted by this on the very top
and something like this under it
[code]
/*npcdrop = (NPCID)   (ITEMID)   (ITEMAMOUNT)   (HOWMANYTIMES!)*/
/*King Black dragon*/
npcdrop = 50   1747   1   100
npcdrop = 50   4675   1   2
npcdrop = 50   14000   1   0
npcdrop = 50   1149   1   2
npcdrop = 50   2577   1   2
npcdrop = 50   2581   1   3
npcdrop = 50   536   1   100
npcdrop = 50   16015   1   1
[/code]
             
now to explain it, the 50 is the npc&#39;s id (in this case king black dragon)
the second number is the id of the item dropped, the 3rd number is how many of it is dropped, and the last one is the percentage (1-100)
ok, so lets look at this code:
[code]npcdrop = 50   536   1   100[/code]
536 is dragon bones, the king black dragon drops them, only one per drop though, all the time
now here is how you would read it:
king black dragon drops 1 dragon bone all the time
king black dragon = 50
dragon bone = 536
drops 1 = the 1 after 536
all the time = the last number 100
and dont be confused, because the last one is the rate of drop, if you put that as 1, it will be very rare, if you put it as 0, it wont drop it at all, i dont know if decimals will work though, so i think the lowest is 1, and the highest is 100, which means the npc will drop that item all the time    


                          AUTOSPAWN
again, very self explanitory:
[code]spawn =	3200	3484	9942	0	0	0	0	0	1[/code] 
DO NOT LET ALL THESE NUMBERS CONFUSE YOU! ONLY EDIT THE FIRST 3!
ok, so the first number is the npc id, which is obvious, the next one is the X, which is the 3484 and the 9942 is the Y cordinates, now when you want to spawn an npc, simply copy and paste the one of the autospawn codes already there, and just change the first number (the npc id) and the X coordinate and the Y coordinate
now lets assume the coordinates are the varrock square (i dont know exactly were these  coordinates are, this is just an example!) and the npc is lets say a greater demon (remember, just an example, this is a different npc!)
so A greater demon would spawn at the varrock square
greater demon = 3200 (it is a different id)
varrock square = the X Y coordinates (3484,9942, again, an example!)
now i know i said only to edit the first 3 numbers, but the other numbers may look different, for example, in this spawn, the other numbers are:
[code]spawn =	181	3564	9961	0	3567	9963	3565	9963	1[/code]
one way or another, just ignore these, i am only covering the basics of autospawning and how to spawn npcs

                      ITEMS
this file, is were item stats, shop prices and if you know what im talking about, when you select your style of combat, it says the weapon name there too (if it is a weapon only, not platebodies or anything else) now lets take a look at a average item cfg code
[code]item = 4587	Dragon_scimitar	A_vicious,_curved_sword.	100000	100000	80929	8	89	-2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	70	0[/code]
ok, one thing i have to say first, for cfg files, whenever you are typing words, make sure you have not a space between every word, but a underscore instead (this _)
So the first number, is the item id, 4587, which is the dragon scimitar&#39;s id, the name, Dragon_scimitar, is what is displayed on the choose combat style menu. Now the examination does not matter, you edit those and the name when you are clicking wield or anything else in class 8 in your client, but thats not what im talking about, so lets just stick to the topic. after the examination, there are 3 numbers? (100000,100000, and 80929) the middle number is how much the shops sell that item for, so the shops would sell dragon scimitars for 100k, and for those of you wondering and thinking you change item prices in the shops.cfg, well now you know. the next numbers are item stats, the 8, 89, -2,0, and 0 are the attack bonuses, and the next 5 are the defence bonuses (i dont think a dragon scimitar is supposed to have defensive stats, but im just telling you in case you edit something like armour) now what lots of people are itching to find out, how to take up the strength bonuses, which is what im going to say now, if you noticed, there are 2 more numbers left, the 70 and the 0 the 70 is the strength bonus, and the last one is the prayer bonus, which is 0, now you know how to edit shop prices and item stats!

                                      SHOPS
and now we go to one of everyone&#39;s favorite, shops!
let me get a shop code for us.
[code]shop = 2	Aubury&#39;s_Rune_Store				2	2	556	500000	554	500000	555	500000	557	500000	558	500000	559	500000	560	100000	562	100000	565	100000	553	100000	566	100000[/code]
now you noticed that the shop codes are long, no these are not just for one item, this is for the entire shop, so lets get to it, the 2 is the shop&#39;s id which should not be touched
Aubury&#39;s_Rune_Store is what is displayed on top of the store interface
still dont get it?
[img]http://img541.imageshack.us/img541/2913/tutexp.png[/img]
notice the words match? except no underscore, so you dont need to worry about that uglying up the name. if you change that name in your shops.cfg, so will the name ingame.
now we move on again,
see this? 556	500000
now here is how it goes,
it starts at 556 right? thats the first item in the store, first, you put the id of the item you want to be sold, which is 556, then, the 500000 is how many is sold, get it? so there is 500k of 556 sold, 500k of 554 sold, so on so forth, ALL NUMBERS MUST BE TABBED IN CFG FILES!

                       NPCS
now, npcs is not used for much, the only thing its used for is hitpoints and spawn rate, example:
[code]npc = 5		Spirit_beast			785	2000	120[/code]
now the 5, is the npc&#39;s id, the name does not matter, that is just for your identification, npc names are changed in the client&#39;s class5.java. 785 is its level, which again does not matter, also edited in client&#39;s class5.java, the third number there, the 2000 is the amount of hitpoints it has, which is the first important thing we come across in the npcs.cfg, changing it to 1000 will make its hp ingame 1000, changing its hp to 1500 will make the ingame hp 1500, its pretty easy. and 120, is the respawn rate for the npc

                  MAGICSPELLS
now, this one has the biggest effect on what its made for,
this cfg controls the emote for the spell, the id of the spell, the gfx for the spell, runes required, if its projectile spell, level required and damage required.
this is pretty much how you make custom spells
now lets take a look at the fire wave spell i customized
[code]spell = 1189	711	287	1	99	556	5	565	1	554	7	-1	0	-1	50	1500	43	100	Jrub_Barrage[/code]
now, lets start, left to right
1189, DO NOT TOUCH THIS! THIS IS THE SPELL ID, CHANGING THIS WILL CAUSE THE SPELL NOT TO WORK IN GAME!
711 is the emote used, example, 711 is the launch spell for the air-fire strike spells, wave your hands around a little and then fire the spell now the next one is the gfx, or graphics, example, the old graphics for the fire wave was the fire wave projectile, i changed it into the exploding fireworks gfx and black darts barrage gfx (this is all in one, it depends on the gfx your using how many gfx it has in it!)
ignore the 1 after that,
the next one is the level needed to use it, although this doesnt change the level required as it shows on the magic spell book interface, you would do that in a different way, so it may confuse your players if you dont change the spell book interface requirment too
now the next 8 numbers all have to do with the ruins, the odd numbers (the first number, third number 5th number and 7th number) are the ids of the runes required to cast this spell,
the even numbers (second number, fourth number, sixth number and 8th number are the amounts needed of those runes)
so lets look at the first two, those are 1 set, the first one is the first rune&#39;s id, and the second is the amount, it says:
556 5
the 556, is the rune id (in this case air rune) and the 5 is how many air runes
so lets look at it like this:
you need 5 air runes, 1 blood rune and 7 fire runes to cast the spell
now the -1, is the item needed to cast the spell, let me clear it up for you
lets look at the saradomin strike spell code
[code]spell = 1190	812	435	0	60	554	2	565	2	556	4	-1	0	2415	40	4	100	100	Saradomin_Strike[/code]
notice instead of -1, there is 2415? this is the saradomin staff code, basically, that number is the id of the weapon or armour piece you need to be wielding as another requirement for the spell
and now, the part probably everyone has been waiting for, the damage!
the next number is the damage, if you look at the saradomin strike code, it says 40, this means the max hit is 40!
now the next number, if you look at the saradomin strike, it says 4, this is the exp per damage, so if you hit a 1, you get 4 exp, hit a 5, you get 20 exp
basically, 4 x the number you hit 
also, like i said, i am only covering the basics, so i will not talk about the last 2 numbers,
but the name, that does not matter either, it does not change the name in the spell book, thats just for you to identify it in the cfg file to make edits


I might cover doors.cfg and globaldrops.cfg later, but i was just explaining what people would need, the basic things people usually change, but until later or unless someone requests doors and globaldrops, i wont do them and not just 1 person, lots of people</description>

<p>some of the new comers on the forums ask about how to change some of these things, so i thought i’d make an tutorial about it. or explanation i guess</p>

              <pre><code>          Please rate me on my explanation, things i needed to add, and if i did good! Say how you feel, its your opinion and i respect it, i wont fight back to senseless firebombs
</code></pre>
<p>So i dont think ive seen a cfg explanation for delta, and if there is one, dont think im leeching this, i made this to the best of my knowledge, the community has given me alot, so i am going to try and give some back with my first tutorial! :DDDD<br>
[size=36pt]DELTA SCAPE CFG FILES[/size]</p>
<pre><code>                      NPC DROP
</code></pre>
<p>now when you open your npcdrops.cfg, you should be confronted by this on the very top<br>
and something like this under it</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/*npcdrop = (NPCID)   (ITEMID)   (ITEMAMOUNT)   (HOWMANYTIMES!)*/
/*King Black dragon*/
npcdrop = 50   1747   1   100
npcdrop = 50   4675   1   2
npcdrop = 50   14000   1   0
npcdrop = 50   1149   1   2
npcdrop = 50   2577   1   2
npcdrop = 50   2581   1   3
npcdrop = 50   536   1   100
npcdrop = 50   16015   1   1</code></pre>
<p>now to explain it, the 50 is the npc’s id (in this case king black dragon)<br>
the second number is the id of the item dropped, the 3rd number is how many of it is dropped, and the last one is the percentage (1-100)<br>
ok, so lets look at this code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">npcdrop = 50   536   1   100</code></pre>
<p>536 is dragon bones, the king black dragon drops them, only one per drop though, all the time<br>
now here is how you would read it:<br>
king black dragon drops 1 dragon bone all the time<br>
king black dragon = 50<br>
dragon bone = 536<br>
drops 1 = the 1 after 536<br>
all the time = the last number 100<br>
and dont be confused, because the last one is the rate of drop, if you put that as 1, it will be very rare, if you put it as 0, it wont drop it at all, i dont know if decimals will work though, so i think the lowest is 1, and the highest is 100, which means the npc will drop that item all the time</p>
<pre><code>                      AUTOSPAWN
</code></pre>
<p>again, very self explanitory:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn =	3200	3484	9942	0	0	0	0	0	1</code></pre>
<p>DO NOT LET ALL THESE NUMBERS CONFUSE YOU! ONLY EDIT THE FIRST 3!<br>
ok, so the first number is the npc id, which is obvious, the next one is the X, which is the 3484 and the 9942 is the Y cordinates, now when you want to spawn an npc, simply copy and paste the one of the autospawn codes already there, and just change the first number (the npc id) and the X coordinate and the Y coordinate<br>
now lets assume the coordinates are the varrock square (i dont know exactly were these  coordinates are, this is just an example!) and the npc is lets say a greater demon (remember, just an example, this is a different npc!)<br>
so A greater demon would spawn at the varrock square<br>
greater demon = 3200 (it is a different id)<br>
varrock square = the X Y coordinates (3484,9942, again, an example!)<br>
now i know i said only to edit the first 3 numbers, but the other numbers may look different, for example, in this spawn, the other numbers are:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn =	181	3564	9961	0	3567	9963	3565	9963	1</code></pre>
<p>one way or another, just ignore these, i am only covering the basics of autospawning and how to spawn npcs</p>
<pre><code>                  ITEMS
</code></pre>
<p>this file, is were item stats, shop prices and if you know what im talking about, when you select your style of combat, it says the weapon name there too (if it is a weapon only, not platebodies or anything else) now lets take a look at a average item cfg code</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">item = 4587	Dragon_scimitar	A_vicious,_curved_sword.	100000	100000	80929	8	89	-2	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	70	0</code></pre>
<p>ok, one thing i have to say first, for cfg files, whenever you are typing words, make sure you have not a space between every word, but a underscore instead (this _)<br>
So the first number, is the item id, 4587, which is the dragon scimitar’s id, the name, Dragon_scimitar, is what is displayed on the choose combat style menu. Now the examination does not matter, you edit those and the name when you are clicking wield or anything else in class 8 in your client, but thats not what im talking about, so lets just stick to the topic. after the examination, there are 3 numbers? (100000,100000, and 80929) the middle number is how much the shops sell that item for, so the shops would sell dragon scimitars for 100k, and for those of you wondering and thinking you change item prices in the shops.cfg, well now you know. the next numbers are item stats, the 8, 89, -2,0, and 0 are the attack bonuses, and the next 5 are the defence bonuses (i dont think a dragon scimitar is supposed to have defensive stats, but im just telling you in case you edit something like armour) now what lots of people are itching to find out, how to take up the strength bonuses, which is what im going to say now, if you noticed, there are 2 more numbers left, the 70 and the 0 the 70 is the strength bonus, and the last one is the prayer bonus, which is 0, now you know how to edit shop prices and item stats!</p>
<pre><code>                                  SHOPS
</code></pre>
<p>and now we go to one of everyone’s favorite, shops!<br>
let me get a shop code for us.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 2	Aubury's_Rune_Store				2	2	556	500000	554	500000	555	500000	557	500000	558	500000	559	500000	560	100000	562	100000	565	100000	553	100000	566	100000</code></pre>
<p>now you noticed that the shop codes are long, no these are not just for one item, this is for the entire shop, so lets get to it, the 2 is the shop’s id which should not be touched<br>
Aubury’s_Rune_Store is what is displayed on top of the store interface<br>
still dont get it?<br>
<img src="http://img541.imageshack.us/img541/2913/tutexp.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
notice the words match? except no underscore, so you dont need to worry about that uglying up the name. if you change that name in your shops.cfg, so will the name ingame.<br>
now we move on again,<br>
see this? 556	500000<br>
now here is how it goes,<br>
it starts at 556 right? thats the first item in the store, first, you put the id of the item you want to be sold, which is 556, then, the 500000 is how many is sold, get it? so there is 500k of 556 sold, 500k of 554 sold, so on so forth, ALL NUMBERS MUST BE TABBED IN CFG FILES!</p>
<pre><code>                   NPCS
</code></pre>
<p>now, npcs is not used for much, the only thing its used for is hitpoints and spawn rate, example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">npc = 5		Spirit_beast			785	2000	120</code></pre>
<p>now the 5, is the npc’s id, the name does not matter, that is just for your identification, npc names are changed in the client’s class5.java. 785 is its level, which again does not matter, also edited in client’s class5.java, the third number there, the 2000 is the amount of hitpoints it has, which is the first important thing we come across in the npcs.cfg, changing it to 1000 will make its hp ingame 1000, changing its hp to 1500 will make the ingame hp 1500, its pretty easy. and 120, is the respawn rate for the npc</p>
<pre><code>              MAGICSPELLS
</code></pre>
<p>now, this one has the biggest effect on what its made for,<br>
this cfg controls the emote for the spell, the id of the spell, the gfx for the spell, runes required, if its projectile spell, level required and damage required.<br>
this is pretty much how you make custom spells<br>
now lets take a look at the fire wave spell i customized</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spell = 1189	711	287	1	99	556	5	565	1	554	7	-1	0	-1	50	1500	43	100	Jrub_Barrage</code></pre>
<p>now, lets start, left to right<br>
1189, DO NOT TOUCH THIS! THIS IS THE SPELL ID, CHANGING THIS WILL CAUSE THE SPELL NOT TO WORK IN GAME!<br>
711 is the emote used, example, 711 is the launch spell for the air-fire strike spells, wave your hands around a little and then fire the spell now the next one is the gfx, or graphics, example, the old graphics for the fire wave was the fire wave projectile, i changed it into the exploding fireworks gfx and black darts barrage gfx (this is all in one, it depends on the gfx your using how many gfx it has in it!)<br>
ignore the 1 after that,<br>
the next one is the level needed to use it, although this doesnt change the level required as it shows on the magic spell book interface, you would do that in a different way, so it may confuse your players if you dont change the spell book interface requirment too<br>
now the next 8 numbers all have to do with the ruins, the odd numbers (the first number, third number 5th number and 7th number) are the ids of the runes required to cast this spell,<br>
the even numbers (second number, fourth number, sixth number and 8th number are the amounts needed of those runes)<br>
so lets look at the first two, those are 1 set, the first one is the first rune’s id, and the second is the amount, it says:<br>
556 5<br>
the 556, is the rune id (in this case air rune) and the 5 is how many air runes<br>
so lets look at it like this:<br>
you need 5 air runes, 1 blood rune and 7 fire runes to cast the spell<br>
now the -1, is the item needed to cast the spell, let me clear it up for you<br>
lets look at the saradomin strike spell code</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spell = 1190	812	435	0	60	554	2	565	2	556	4	-1	0	2415	40	4	100	100	Saradomin_Strike</code></pre>
<p>notice instead of -1, there is 2415? this is the saradomin staff code, basically, that number is the id of the weapon or armour piece you need to be wielding as another requirement for the spell<br>
and now, the part probably everyone has been waiting for, the damage!<br>
the next number is the damage, if you look at the saradomin strike code, it says 40, this means the max hit is 40!<br>
now the next number, if you look at the saradomin strike, it says 4, this is the exp per damage, so if you hit a 1, you get 4 exp, hit a 5, you get 20 exp<br>
basically, 4 x the number you hit<br>
also, like i said, i am only covering the basics, so i will not talk about the last 2 numbers,<br>
but the name, that does not matter either, it does not change the name in the spell book, thats just for you to identify it in the cfg file to make edits</p>
<p>I might cover doors.cfg and globaldrops.cfg later, but i was just explaining what people would need, the basic things people usually change, but until later or unless someone requests doors and globaldrops, i wont do them and not just 1 person, lots of people</p>
