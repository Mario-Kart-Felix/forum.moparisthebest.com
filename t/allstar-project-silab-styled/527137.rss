    <title>Allstar Project(silab styled)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allstar-project-silab-styled/527137</link>
    <description>Alright well, i dont know if this is the right place to write this but.. I was thinking of making a new project to bring back the old styled sources.  

- what i wanted to do was take a stable source and rebuild like an allstar scape  or something
example: old styled client with emote teleporting system, and old graphics ofc.
Server will be meant to be a true private server like it once was meant to be, the point of a server is not to copy the original but to make it fun and (easy), so i was thinking throw in all those custom hats and different color whips and ect.

other features that should be in, Maybe a pkbox right at home and all the old minigames silab had to offer.

In addition i also have a lot of connection and can easily get the server populated

Webclient will be made and a website which i am good with

If you are a developer and want to work with me comment

this is my other work, its a server of another game.   website: rainbow-pirates.com</description>
