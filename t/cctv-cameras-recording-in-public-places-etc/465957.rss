    <title>CCTV Cameras, Recording in public places, etc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cctv-cameras-recording-in-public-places-etc/465957</link>
    <description>Inspired by a discussion on IRC.

I am of the opinion that anyone, for any reason, should be allowed to take photos, record audio and videos in a public place, for any reason. 

By a public place I am generally talking about streets, sidewalks, pavements, whatever you want to call it. Some exceptions apply, courthouses while technically public places is not what I am aiming for. 

By &#39;for any reason&#39; I am generally talking about what is within the law. If some girl flashes her tits in a public place, people should be allowed to record video and take pictures, it&#39;s a public place. Creepshots and the like may or may not be considered sexual harassment, I&#39;m all for taking pictures but that shouldn&#39;t exclude them from sexual harassment laws.

The number one target should be to prevent the crime. That you punish the people who break the law isn’t an argument. If you can fine people while they are doing the recording you would have a much easier job than proving the sale in court. It isn’t just about selling the pictures, it is also about stopping douches like <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,577049.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Frell</a>.</p>

Fine we agree. Then what is wrong with reducing people’s right to film whatever they want? We both think there should be some exceptions, but then we allow the exceptions.</p>

<p>Arguably, but as you said not everyone is law-abiding and considering the recent development of phone cameras it’s damn near impossible to escape a camera. Personally I think it’s better to protect the rights of photographers in general than it is to protect the idea of privacy in a public setting. Granted I went into extremes a bit, I don’t think it is good or nice for people to stalk other people and I think laws should be tighter on that to prevent people from stalking and recording them.</p>

              <p>tl;dr all of the replies, but my view is that when you go out in public you have already submitted yourself to the public eye, and as such you can be filmed/photographed.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>While I agree it would be beneficial to have more privacy in public places, I have a few issues with this. By its very nature, public places aren’t private, anything that can be seen or heard by a video camera can likely be seen by a human, the only difference is that a photo or a video would ‘immortalise’ the moment. Another issue I have is “should CCTV’s be allowed?” if so, then so should (video) cameras, if not, then should it extend to (video) cameras?</p>
<p>I disagree that there would be no control over the picture, for Europe, USA, Australia, and NZ to name a few you cannot sell a photo of a person without that persons consent, a similar law could be put in place for pictures of people in discriminating instances. Such a clause would be problematic though, what would be deemed a discriminating instance? Nudity, public humiliation, alcohol?</p>

</aside>
<p>Well sure it is perverted, it was the first example that came to mind. As I previously stated, should such a courtesy be extended to people in discriminating situations, i.e., a person puking or a person drinking alcohol?</p>
<p>As to being allowed to record every stupid thing people do, as harsh as this is going to sound they should have known better. I don’t agree with this on a personal level but hey. On the topic however, people get ‘recorded’ doing stupid shit on the internet all the time, to the point where there are services to ‘spy’ on people for future employers. In Europe at least there are laws preventing employers discriminating on potential employees, but what about all the interviews that would not have happened that is impossible to police? I think this is far more damaging than people being allowed to take photos and videos in an already public place.</p>

<p>This is also an ironic point of view. People doesn’t want people spying on them in their own house, why should them accept being spied on outside their house?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>People inside their house generally have implied privacy, people cannot waltz into your house and take photos or record videos, people cannot spy on you through your windows or such. If you want, you can close your curtains and bam, instant privacy. If you leave your house you lose some of this privacy, people can still see and hear you, they can hear your end of a phone call and read your texts over your shoulder, there’s not much you can do to regain your privacy other than wearing something like a burqa.</p>
<p>The reason I hold the position I do is because I feel having the legal right to take pictures and record video in a public place shouldn’t be prevented, I think police and military personnel should be able to be recorded publicly, in the case of CCTV and say, speed cameras I think should be allowed to catch any perpetrators of a crime.</p>
<p>It’s funny actually, Wizzup on IRC who is also a Dutchy held the exact same position as you!</p>

              <p>Finally we completely disagree on a subject.</p>
<p>People should have the right of privacy even on public ground. It isn’t fair to force people to forfeit some of their freedom just because they want to go out. You have no control over the usage of the pictures after they are taken, and they might get exploited.</p>
<p>You might think you are entitled to take pictures of tits just because some girl flashed theirs, but that is a short-sighed perverted mindset. Why should you be allowed to record every stupid thing people do?</p>
<p>This is also an ironic point of view. People doesn’t want people spying on them in their own house, why should them accept being spied on outside their house?</p>

              <p>Inspired by a discussion on IRC.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that anyone, for any reason, should be allowed to take photos, record audio and videos in a public place, for any reason.</p>
<p>By a public place I am generally talking about streets, sidewalks, pavements, whatever you want to call it. Some exceptions apply, courthouses while technically public places is not what I am aiming for.</p>
<p>By ‘for any reason’ I am generally talking about what is within the law. If some girl flashes her tits in a public place, people should be allowed to record video and take pictures, it’s a public place. Creepshots and the like may or may not be considered sexual harassment, I’m all for taking pictures but that shouldn’t exclude them from sexual harassment laws.</p>
