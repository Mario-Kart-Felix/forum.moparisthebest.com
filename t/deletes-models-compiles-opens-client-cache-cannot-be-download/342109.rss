    <title>*Deletes Models* *Compiles* *Opens Client* Cache Cannot Be Download!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deletes-models-compiles-opens-client-cache-cannot-be-download/342109</link>
    <description>Ok, yesterday the following happened:

I was trying to add Staff of Light to my server. It did not work, so I deleted the models. After I compiled and opened client, it said cache cannot be downloaded! I didn&#39;t change anything else! I redownloaded the client but the same thing happens. Can anyone help me? I can&#39;t work on my server if I can&#39;t even login  :mad:</description>
