    <title>Chat Area Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chat-area-question/543378</link>
    <description>Hello,

I was trying to learn more about the client and i had been working on a complete visual rework of the project insanity client.

So i will go into detail with my question...

I want to increase the limit of how far the text can be displayed in a row because has a max of 8 Messages for the box before it rolls to the next set of messages,

How would i go about increasing this too say 15?

I know its a strange request but i have a grand idea though i do not know the client well enough to do it without help. So far i have been able to figure it out but this i have been trying to figure out looking at different methods but so far too no avail.

If you could post here or Message me on skype it would be a great help and i would add you and give you full credit for the chatbox modifications.
