    <description>[center]Hi there guys :D

I have previously coded 317 on a windows 7 machine for a year or so, and ive suddenly got back into rsps and was wondering if anyone can help me with getting the right java stuff. Like before you needed to get java 6 update &quot;whatever the update was at the time&quot;.

I&#39;ve tried downloading a few sources and clients. but they always come up with errors;
for example a delta source/PI source when i double click the run.bat, on windows it would of opened up the cmd prompt with run.bat, now it opens up a error saying &#39; There is no application set to open document &quot;runserver.bat&quot; &#39; Then the option &quot;choose application&quot; &quot;cancel&quot; and &quot;search app store&quot;.

[b]Many thanks in advance,
Lee[/b]</description>
