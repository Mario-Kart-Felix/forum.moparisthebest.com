    <title>Serious, frustrating problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/serious-frustrating-problem/136742</link>
    <description>Now this might sound extremely wierd to you guys, since I have spoken in person to several extreme hardware geeks and they couldn&#39;t figure out the problem, I&#39;ll ask you.

Ok, one year ago, I begun having trouble with my Radeon 9200 video card. A few days before the trouble started I installed a custom driver based on the official one called &quot;Omega&quot;. I ran Counter-Strike one morning after that, and got 5 fps. So I changed to the official drivers - same thing. I reinstalled Windows - still the same. I switched to Linux, same. Very low fps on 3D graphics.

So I just dealt with this for about 10 months, with even YOUTUBE lagging!

So, one day, while both of my parents were gone, I switched all the hardware between me and my dad&#39;s computer (we have identical mobo&#39;s, and case&#39;s, so he wouldn&#39;t be able to test the difference). I boot up, and video and 3D graphics works perfectly :D I was ecstatic to finally be able to play games made in 1998!

Then, a couple days later, I (not smartly) booted into Windows again with the same Omega driver, used mIRC for a while (completely oblivious to my huge error), watched a Youtube video, then BAM the computer locked down. I booted back into Linux. Watched the same video, worked. I then ran one of the 3D games I had been playing for the last few days, and, oh crap - 5 fps.

So I&#39;ve been living with this again, having &quot;screwed up&quot; two computers, until this morning I wanted to watch a video on Google Video (on Linux), but when the video began, the entire computer locked up. I booted into Windows, exact same thing.

I am REALLY upset, and I would like to know what the FUCK is happening. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a BIOS problem or something, with the BIOS panicking with the Omega driver and changing some (hidden) settings. But I&#39;ve tried to revert to defaults but it makes no difference. Any ideas, guys? :)

Thanks a TON,

From what you said I think it corrupted your graphics card. If you’re running on a Radeon 9200, it’s time for an upgrade anyway.<br>

<p>I said, I switched the hardware (including the card) in me and my dad’s computer, and it worked. Getting a new card won’t fix anything, since I tried my brother’s and it froze at videos too. I’m almost convinced it is some sort of BIOS problem, or maybe a fucked up AGP slot…[/quote]</p>
<p>Got a third computer you could test the mobo/card on?</p>
