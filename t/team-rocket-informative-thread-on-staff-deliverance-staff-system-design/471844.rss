    <title>[Team_Rocket] Informative Thread on Staff [Deliverance Staff System] - Design -</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/team-rocket-informative-thread-on-staff-deliverance-staff-system-design/471844</link>
    <description>Thread Purpose: We&#39;re tired of people asking &quot;Where can I adjust my Player Rights? How do I set myself to be an Administrator?&quot;. Hopefully this will stop a lot of those questions, and if we&#39;re lucky - then we might just learn something. Perhaps you might even create your own System!

Thread Notes: This does NOT cover external schemas or Databases.

Thread Key: [b]Capitalization is symbolic of importance.[/b]




You can grant Staff or any type of status you like to any Player in a variety of different ways. Here are some of the most common designs which RuneScape Private Servers lean towards using:

1. Saving Player Rights into the Player-Character file as a value. This is confirmed once their file is loaded.

2. Adjusting Player Rights upon Login based on the Player&#39;s Username. This is usually stuck into the Player Class. Elevation is confirmed once Login is completed with corresponding conditions.

3. Saving Player Usernames inside of a Configuration file. Stored outside of a Class file; not physically stored in Java. This is updated once Tables are re-loaded.

4. Otherwise confirming the elevation of Rights. This is sometimes done inside of a vital Method, such as a Run, Initiate, or otherwise universally checked Method.





[b]Staff to Player Interaction and You:[/b]

When Players see an Administrative Staff Member (Golden Crown A.K.A. &#39;JMod&#39;), their first response is to naturally be on their best behavior. This can be compared as to a relationship with a deceitful person. For a time, everything is fine, but eventually their true persona will show. I&#39;ve taken the liberty of listing our personal Staff List. We&#39;ll also explain much more below it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;  20. Game-Master (In-game/Forums)

  19. Deputy Administrator (Forums)

  18. Community Manager (In-game/Forums)

  17. Assistant Community Manager (In-game/Forums)

  16. Lead Player Moderator (In-game)

  15. Senior Player Moderator (In-game)

  14. Player Moderator (In-game)

  13. Probationary Player Moderator (In-game)

  12. Lead Forum Moderator (Forums)

  11. Senior Forum Moderator (Forums)

  10. Forum Moderator (Forums)

  9. Probationary Forum Moderator (Forums)

  8. Community Watcher (Forums)

  7. Probationary Community Watcher (Forums)

  6. Server Guide (In-game/Forums)

  5. Probationary Server Guide (In-game/Forums)
   
  4. Forum Guide (Forums)

  3. Probationary Forum Guide (Forums)

  2. Think Tank Group (Forums)

  1. Event Planners (Forums)&lt;/blockquote&gt;


You might look at this and say to yourself &quot;20 Ranks, wow, that&#39;s crazy! There&#39;s no way this could ever work out&quot;. This Chain of Command System is one of the most effective means of personalizing your Staff and building your Community. Each Rank reports to the Rank above their own. Ranks 14 and above also must report themselves to the entire Community and all Staff Members as well. 

[b]Question:[/b] What&#39;s up with the &#39;Probationary&#39; Ranks on your Staff List?

[i][b]Answer[/b][/i]: Probationary Ranks are only assigned when two situations present themselves:

1. If a User is being tested in some fashion.

2. If an investigation of said User is being conducted or is underway.

Probationary Ranks hold the Status and Rank, but they are completely stripped of Power.


[b]Question:[/b] Why are there 20 Ranks, but only 1 Administrative Rank which makes an in-game appearance?

[i][b]Answer:[/b][/i] A &#39;Golden Crown&#39; Administrator, or as we like to call it, a &#39;Game-Master&#39;. This is the ultimate position of Power, and [b]VERY FEW[/b] people should ever achieve this. In fact, it should be reserved for the Developers and Designers only. Which should be a very small and efficient Team which is capable of independent and unique thought. Individuality with personal flare will more than make up for small numbers on your Programming Team; some passion and knowledge required. A Game-Master should be able to do the following at a whim:

1. Mask themselves as invisible to other Player-Clients and the Mini Map as well.

2. Change their Username via Command (Commands are discussed farther down the Thread).

3. Adjust their Rights and Crown accordingly.

4. Edit Statistics.

Powers such as these will eliminate the need for your Game-Master(s) to create a secondary Account. This Staff System is designed to work as a well-oiled machine. It changes based upon circumstances, balances on It&#39;s own, and covers It&#39;s possible mistakes. Unfortunately, Bias is still present and always will be. It can be cut down however.

Please note: Any Rank above 18 was created to operate with compensation and the utmost professionalism. These should be paid employees who are adults and take a job seriously. They are much less likely to abuse their Powers or Rank.



[b]Staff Punishment, Player Punishment, and the Council of 12 Virgins:[/b]

We&#39;ll start with &quot;The Council of 12 Virgins first&quot;. Let us first define the word &#39;Virgin&#39; in OUR terms. A &#39;Virgin Account&#39; is one which has never been in trouble, has never received a punishment, never visited Jail, and has never had a complaint filed against them. Think of the Council of 12 as the American Jury System, except, the Council of 12 doesn&#39;t have the final say. In a case of Player Punishment, the Council collaborates with anyone and everyone inside of the Community. This includes personal responsibilities which are delegated and require them to take initiative on their part, such as investigating, social engineering, and other such ways of proving Guilt or Innocence. Once the Council has concluded their Investigation, they then recommend their Verdict and Punishment for the selected Player to a Game-Master.

In the case of Staff Punishment - the Council only has a say of Guilty or Innocent. The Community as a whole decides the most fitting punishment for Staff Members. Ranks 14 and above have no say or involvement in this process.

The Council of 12 Virgins and this System relies heavily on random (pre-selected) factorization to prevent Bias as much as possible. The Council of 12 must be investigated themselves before they may investigate others. These Users have select access to sensitive Read-Only information which is to only be used for the purpose of discerning a Verdict.




[b]Staff and Player Commands:[/b]

Players should not have access to [i]ANY[/i] Commands. These should be reserved for Users above the Rank of 14 and above. All Commands used by these Staffers should have their Line stored in a Log of some type. This also goes for many other mechanics which Staffers otherwise might not have access to. With the proper logging and tracking, Player Moderators would eventually be able to wield the Power of the Internet Protocol Ban. Before you come back with &quot;I.P. Banning for PMods!?! That&#39;s way too likely to be abused!&quot;. There are several responses to this, but the best I believe is: &quot;There are worse things than being temporarily halted from playing&quot;. 



[b]Staff Promotion and Selection:[/b]

Each potential Staffer must go through a Probationary Observation period. This lasts for an [i]absolute minimum[/i] of one Week (7 days). The maximum observation time is one Month. The potential Staff Member must be monitored, observed, logged, and spied upon in ways which they do not know exist, or aren&#39;t familiar with when compared to conventional means. Recommendations from current Staff Members are  ignored [i]unless[/i] the recommendations aren&#39;t voluntary. The Community must ultimately decide who they wish to be in charge of what.





[font=impact]------------------Pros and Cons------------------[/font]

[ul]+  Time saving and self-efficient

+ More justice than most

+ When completed allows for total control

+ Staff Members can&#39;t form a &#39;Buddy System&#39; to counter this



- Overwhelming to an average User

- Might seem overly complicated

- Bias is still present and can ruin this System if the corruption spreads far enough[/ul]








[b][i][u]Conclusion (TL;DR):

The current Staff System which most Private Servers follow is silly and outdated. It allows for virtually anyone to become a potentially abusive and power-hungry Staffer. This is something you do NOT want of course. Hopefully we can start advancing on it a bit.


P.S. This is not fully complete and will be updated at a later time.</description>

<p>Regarding the information though, I would say it’s a great idea to implement, but it would require a tremendous amount of patience for each staff members and the community.

<p>A design is just that - a design. This goes to the difference between design and development. I listed the common ways R.S.P.S. like to handle their Player Rights.</p>
<p>I see what you’re saying though, and you’re right.</p>

I understand your love for big staff teams, but a team this big isn’t necessary as most servers don’t even have this many players. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>
