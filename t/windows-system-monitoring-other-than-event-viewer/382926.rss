    <title>Windows system monitoring other than event viewer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/windows-system-monitoring-other-than-event-viewer/382926</link>
    <description>Recently I have been plagued with the strange occurrence of my system randomly restarting without a blue screen. Upon reboot I get one of those &quot;send error reports&quot; that take me to a website stating that the crash was caused due to a driver crash. It does not say which device or issue that is caused.  I took a peek in the event viewer which has no indication of system troubles other than a time sync issue due to me not being able to connect to one of the time servers. I have not done any driver updates in awhile and searched all of my devices and found no new drivers. Does anyone know of another system monitoring application that may be able to better assist me in identifying which piece of hardware is the culprit.</description>

<p>Your other alternative that would tell you if it was a software or hardware problem would be to run Linux for awhile and see what happens.  If it doesn’t crash, you have a software problem with windows, if it does, you have a hardware problem and the Linux system logs (like dmesg) would almost surely let you diagnose it.</p>

<p>i could’ve guessed you’d throw a linux based solution into the thread</p>

              <p>The event log can be filtered with registry settings, the default might not log whatever you’re looking for, sounds pretty dumb if it doesn’t but then it is Windows. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
