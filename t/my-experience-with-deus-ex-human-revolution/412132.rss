    <description>I preordered the game like an idiot because the first Deus Ex was brilliant and was actually a PC game so I had hoped that Deus Ex: Human Revolution would be too instead of just another console port. 9 Days after the pirated version appeared on torrent sites and steam finally unlocks the game for me since I&#39;m a eurofag, and exactly 10 seconds after I started playing I immediately stopped playing. 

2 small words caused me to stop playing: mouse acceleration, but that isn&#39;t much of a problem, so it takes 5 more small words to really ruin the game: no way to disable the

<p>I don’t think it’s so silly, it was an honest mistake on my end but forced mouse acceleration really ruins the experience for me and I’ll give you an idea on how bad it was, with mouse+acceleration I couldn’t pick up a small static item on the first try or second try, with my PS3 controller plugged in as a gamepad I was able to play late-game on max difficulty with ease and I had the aim-assist turned off</p>
<p>funny thing, DX:HR supports gamepads but the only gamepad it recognizes is the official 360 pad, I had to set my PS3 controller to emulate the 360 controller before I could even play</p>

<p>it may look like crysis but it plays nothing like it, if I had to compare it to another game I’d say it was similar to mgs4 if mgs4 was first person and played a little more like a fps</p>
