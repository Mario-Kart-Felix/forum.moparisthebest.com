    <description>I have been working on tree farming for a friend and I have noticed that it is affecting performance to a fairly large extent. What is the best way to do something similar to this without causing major performance issues?</description>

              <p>[quote=“Lin, post:6, topic:521176”]Don’t update it in real-time. Record the last time the farm patch was messed with and set a pre-determined value for the chance a disease or something will come up and wait for that to fire. This is only needed if the player stays within view of the plant the entire time. The next time the player enters the region, either by just walking to the map or logging on, calculate the amount of time that passed since it was last touched and cycle through all the possible events. There is no need for any sort of events.[/quote]that’s actually… ingenious :o</p>
<p>I will have to play with this idea and see what I can do. (never tried anything like that before) but it should be possible to do on the current base with a little trial/error. Thanks lin. <em>two thumbs up</em></p>

              <p>[quote=“sinisoul, post:3, topic:521176”]Did farming in the past, there’s a formula to calculate the different stages of each Farming object. Cant remember what that formula is though, heh. How are you doing it now?[/quote]well the current way it is being handled is via my tickmanager and it is saved at certain stages using the different configs. ( I think I explained that right ) and it isn’t my tickmanager it’s some leaked tickmanager or something idk.</p>
