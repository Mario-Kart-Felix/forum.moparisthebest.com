        <p>That’s a fair question. Those activities that you’ve listed all involve a continual investment of time throughout the life of employment. It isn’t a one off hour or two of work and a bit of luck.<br>
With that said, I have no qualms with paying for such services.</p>
<p>I suppose what I said above didn’t entirely clarify my view. I don’t agree with the fact that most money comes from return on investment.</p>
<p>Back to the television example. Someone might buy infrastructure to launch a national TV service (like Foxtel).<br>
For argument’s sake, let’s say this infrastructure costs 1 billion dollars up front.<br>
Now let’s say that this TV service costs $40 a month, and has a penetration rate of maybe 10%. In a country like Australia, this is about 2.3 million people.<br>
That’s 92 million dollars monthly, which means that, in just one year, the value of the investment has been entirely recouped.<br>
BUT, the infrastructure is likely to work for a decade or two, with maintenance that is fairly negligible in price compared to the original investment (electricity costs and perhaps damage from storms, whatever).</p>
<p>I know my example is likely an oversimplification, and 1 billion dollars may not be an accurate up front investment that a TV service would expect to pay. But the ideology is the same.<br>
Bottom line, 90% of the country are locked out of a service which in this case is directly available to them (there’s literally radio waves floating over their homes), but denied to them out of sheer spite. And if 100% of people were given the access for say $5 monthly instead of $40, the company would actually be making MORE money anyway.</p>
<p>And that’s it. The same is easily applied to most music – Nine Inch Nails notwithstanding, because Trent Reznor proactively encouraged theft of his music; even the musicians know that the record companies are ripping people off, big time.<br>
Instead of charging a price that would allow virtually 100% uptake of a product, they choose to charge 10% of people a price that is, quite frankly, so inflated that it should make most people sick, and by doing so they lock everyone else out.</p>

</aside>
<p>The Nine Inch Nails/Radiohead situation means nothing, imo. Yes it was nice that they sort of gave some music away - but they’re already both rich as hell (especially Reznor) so who gives a fuck? Bill Gates gives money away all the time, and it’s nice and everything but it doesn’t prove a point.</p>
<p>I have yet to see an argument for restructuring the music industry that doesn’t completely ignore (or invent) how the music industry works. I have expect you to tell me in a minute that they should recoup money on tours.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh and believe it or not, companies do base their pricing on what they expect market share to be. They’re not going to suddenly up and discover economics 101 anytime soon - if there was a way to get more money, they’d do it. If you’re saying they should accept a loss in profits to get a greater market share, then uh, why? If you can sell something to 10 people for 100 each or 100 people for 10 each, you do the former, always.</p>

        <p>I was suggesting a loss of profits on a per-customer basis which could probably result an increase in the total profit due to far more uptake (which affordability would allow).</p>

Yeah. The speeds I’m talking about though are 50 - 100Mbps, which are deliverable in some areas via cable iirc. It’s such a joke.</p>

        <p>The MPAA and RIAA are fucking pigs. They may be justified in their actions, but that doesn’t make them any better. They are out to strip everybody of all the money they can. I bet if sharing CDs or letting friends listen to your music wasn’t protect under Fair Use, they’d sue people for that. There’s a point where you cross over from being business minding to a straight up money guzzling whore. The RIAA and MPAA have reached that latter. Fuck them. Seriously. Fuck. Them.</p>
