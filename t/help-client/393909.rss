    <title>Help client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-client/393909</link>
    <description>So i ran the client it goes to the log in screen. It was on a different ip and i connected to it then i switched it to my ip that i made from no-ip.com and tried connecting and it didn&#39;t work. Do i need to portforward even though i am using my computer? And how would i set this server up on a vps and do i still need to portforward? I don&#39;t understand what do i portforward my own ip or the ip i got from no-ip.

thanks</description>

So i ran the client it goes to the log in screen. It was on a different ip and i connected to it then i switched it to my ip that i made from <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and tried connecting and it didn’t work. Do i need to portforward even though i am using my computer? And how would i set this server up on a vps and do i still need to portforward?

[/quote]Yes you must port if you use your computer. After you have ported via your router and firewall you can use <a href="http://canyouseem.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseem.org</a> to help see if the port is open.[/quote]</p>
<p>i portforwarded but it’s not working i get this error on canyouseeme</p>
<p>Error: I could not see your service on IP ADDRESS on port (43594)<br>
Reason: Connection refused</p>
<p>i have no idea why i think i portforwarded it correctly</p>
