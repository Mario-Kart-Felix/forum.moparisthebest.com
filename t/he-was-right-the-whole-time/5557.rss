    <title>He was right the whole time</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/he-was-right-the-whole-time/5557</link>
    <description>He = Vipsta
What was he right about = Gander is an ass
Why?
I&#39;m was first unadmined from rs-server, then I was banned, now I&#39;m IP banned...
The story=
It all started with a chat with Vipsta, Vipsta said he didn&#39;t Ddos Rs-server, and I believe him (now!), why did he so shitty against rs-server? Because that Gayder was blaming vipsta for ddossing, while it&#39;s someone else, So, I said sorry to vipsta, and vipsta said sorry to me, and I was happy with that, but, When gayder knew that I said sorry, he came mad at me, and got pissed so bad that he said he would give rs-server to me. So I said to tony, if gander comes back (which I knew he would), I quit rs-server.
So, not knowing what to do first, I decided to make l3etal3lade take Gander&#39;s place.
Then gander unblocked me and said, What you&#39;re going to do now? I said, I&#39;m going to make the best of it, and l3eta is going to take ur place...
He said, Well hannes, I&#39;ll leave u a choice, me or l3eta... (So he wanted to come back)
And I was thinking hard... And I asked, can&#39;t I take u both (&lt;- Remember this, u&#39;ll need it more down xD)
He said No! Why beta (&lt;- Remember this, u&#39;ll need it more down xD)- he prolly didn&#39;t know who beta was :o
So I said, why not man, Beta is a much respected user and stuff....
After a bit of shitting, he said like ok, hannes, make a choice, me or u :-|
So he changed it, I was lyk wtf!
So I decided to quit (which i would do allready).
But I was still active on the community...
That all went very good untill a few days ago when I saw that Beta was made trial MOD! So, he made me choose for nothing...
Whatever, I couldn&#39;t care
UNTILL yesterday, when gander started to fight against me, and at the end, he said: I just want to be friends...
I was lyk WTF! He started fighting, then he wanted to be friends again??
So I said... IDK.

Then, we didn&#39;t talk, untill today, I wanted to go to rs-server, to see whats up, and I saw I was banned so i made a new account to post in suggestions to unban drunkenoldma, so, what did i see, he blocked my name so it said unban *************,
So i edited and i made it, unban drunken fucking old ma, then swift (&lt;3) unbanned me and such, then gander unblocked me from msn, and started to flame again...

So now Im IP banned, and SO PISSED AT GANDER.

Vipsta, again sorry I flamed at you about this, but u were right the whole time, THE WHOLE TIME!

EDIT: Last thing gander said to me on msn:
gander says:
now fuck you okay? go fucking cry over your gay shitass music and your gay shit ass life fuck off from rs-server nobody wants you there get a fucking life go eat shit out of your mothers pussy like always</description>

<p>Is this true? Although Gander isn’t like who he used to be, it seems like only likes me because I gave him my update masks, after I gave him them he starts saying he found them all himself and then downloads my source and starts saying he’s gonna use it for his source when he’s not even suppose to have it. And what people say about him using donations for his own gain is true, Gander acts nice to me but I know he isn’t to others, and I also heard (from a lot of people) that he steals credit and bitches about me behind my back.</p>

              <p>Is this true? Although Gander isn’t like who he used to be, it seems like only likes me because I gave him my update masks, after I gave him them he starts saying he found them all himself and then downloads my source and starts saying he’s gonna use it for his source when he’s not even suppose to have it. And what people say about him using donations for his own gain is true, Gander acts nice to me but I know he isn’t to others, and I also heard (from a lot of people) that he steals credit and bitches about me behind my back.</p>
