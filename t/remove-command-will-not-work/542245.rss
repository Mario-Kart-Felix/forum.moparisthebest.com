    <title>Remove command will not work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/remove-command-will-not-work/542245</link>
    <description>Ok so I have this issue with my &quot;Remove&quot; command. The command is ;;remove and what it does is once you examine an object, and then execute the code ;;remove, it will remove that object from the game. This is a Rune-Evo base.  Well it does delete the object from the game, visually it will disappear. The issue is everytime i shut off the server to reboot it for an update, the objects i used on the remove command, come back. Does anyone have an idea as to why this is happening?
