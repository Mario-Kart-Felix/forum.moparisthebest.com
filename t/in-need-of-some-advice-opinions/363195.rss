    <title>In need of some advice/opinions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-need-of-some-advice-opinions/363195</link>
    <description>First of all, if this is the wrong section I&#39;m sorry.

Anyways, I&#39;m considering developing a server, and I need some advice or opinions.

The bases I will most likely use are:

Hyperion
Emulous
Shard

What are the pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of each and which would you prefer I use?

I am grateful for any input so it can be little details as well.</description>
