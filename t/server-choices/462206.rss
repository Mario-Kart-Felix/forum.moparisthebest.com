    <description>Hey guys i&#39;m not coding still but just wanted to have a discussion on servers here, please add to the conversation.

So my first point to address is what the fuck is up with PI&#39;s? Why would somebody want to start a PI, it&#39;s not oldschool nor a new server type. I think it&#39;s right in the middle which blows. I mean I personally choose either like 728&#39;s or something like Delta oldschool Rune-legacy type.

My second point to address is why the hell are we posting guides over and over again. I left about 2 months ago when I quit and now that I come back and look at the guides and snippets section it&#39;s the same shit.

My third point to address is why the hell did we get rid of reputation. I think that we need reputation even if we revise it completely we need a god damn rep system! How are we supposed to know who is a complete fucking noob posting some shitty leech and who is posting a revolutionary server? Plus when a noob posts something good I want to rep them up because I want them to help be recognized by our community.

My final point to address is server quantities. To noobs: Stop making servers if you&#39;re complete shit, don&#39;t download a server and host it, you need to code something first. You will never succeed if you don&#39;t. Also I think we need to stop making so many damn servers, With so many with about 10 players on them it&#39;s way to hard to get players and recruit people. I think we need to cut down on server quantities because the players are way to spread out it&#39;s impossible to make a new successful server, it&#39;s the same 10 from 2 years ago that have the most players.

Feel free to respond to this add what point you are responding to so it can help us.</description>

<p>RSPS died out when people realised you could make money out of it. We have been beating a dead horse for years.</p>
<p>The same tutorials are released daily, the same servers with the same changes are released daily. Everytime someone contributes something remotely against the grain it gets drowned by 100 copies of the same shit.[/quote]<br>
I’ll believe you when this community and any others that are rsps related drain to 50 active members.  What’s dead in your eyes aren’t everyone else’s views on the subject, I personally still enjoy seeing things released and playing on servers.  Sure, it’s nice to see something different, probably better actually, but I’m not going to go and take away basically every right that new people have on this website, it turns people away from the community.</p>
<p>In reality, we won’t always be working with this so some kind of fan base has to be here to continue working on it, otherwise the community will die because we’re only supporting what we find fun and our word is law, despite us being no better than them (besides our ability to properly speak English, maybe :rolleyes:)</p>

<p>rep will be back soon as taharok said in the announcements and everyone here has a right to make a server doesn’t really matter if it is leeched i started out as a leech i used the matrix scratch files which eventually turned out into the NRS3server we all know today who knows what looks like the crappiest server in history may turn out as the greatest rsps known to all programmers</p>
<p>Moparian means nothing to me its just a member group assigned once you reach a number of posts all moparians you see have over 1000 posts</p>

              <p>Hey guys i’m not coding still but just wanted to have a discussion on servers here, please add to the conversation.</p>
<p>So my first point to address is what the fuck is up with PI’s? Why would somebody want to start a PI, it’s not oldschool nor a new server type. I think it’s right in the middle which blows. I mean I personally choose either like 728’s or something like Delta oldschool Rune-legacy type.</p>
<p>My second point to address is why the hell are we posting guides over and over again. I left about 2 months ago when I quit and now that I come back and look at the guides and snippets section it’s the same shit.</p>
<p>My third point to address is why the hell did we get rid of reputation. I think that we need reputation even if we revise it completely we need a god damn rep system! How are we supposed to know who is a complete fucking noob posting some shitty leech and who is posting a revolutionary server? Plus when a noob posts something good I want to rep them up because I want them to help be recognized by our community.</p>
<p>My final point to address is server quantities. To noobs: Stop making servers if you’re complete shit, don’t download a server and host it, you need to code something first. You will never succeed if you don’t. Also I think we need to stop making so many damn servers, With so many with about 10 players on them it’s way to hard to get players and recruit people. I think we need to cut down on server quantities because the players are way to spread out it’s impossible to make a new successful server, it’s the same 10 from 2 years ago that have the most players.</p>
<p>Feel free to respond to this add what point you are responding to so it can help us.</p>
