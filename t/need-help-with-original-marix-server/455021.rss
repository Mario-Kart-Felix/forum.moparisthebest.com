    <title>Need help with original marix server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-original-marix-server/455021</link>
    <description>I have two problems; running the source and running the server... when I run the source, it gives me an error with starting the java.dll or some crap, but I do have jdk 7 update 5 installed, so i dont get it?

And as for the cache, it gives me a &quot;main&quot; cache file error, as if I dont have the cache in it, but I actually checkedand removedand applied the cache 5 times. Any help?

This is the &quot;Matrix&quot; server that dragonkk posted himself in the moparscape forums...many other people are having this issue...can anyone help?</description>
