    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-jarring-my-client/196217</link>
    <description>Okay, I downloaded the .jar maker, and i make it so it jar&#39;s my client, but when I open the folder that I wanna jar, theres no files, well there is but there is like folders, like sprites and stuff, so I jar that, then I run it, and it says its corrupt, can someone give me a batch file that has a jarring thing in it? *ps* I have java 6.5 [I used mod toharoks perfect compiler and it says I need different java]

thanks =]

if you cant get a batch file with one in it could you please help me with the jarring program?</description>
