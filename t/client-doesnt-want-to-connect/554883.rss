    <title>Client doesn&#39;t want to connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-doesnt-want-to-connect/554883</link>
    <description>I downloaded a source/client/cache that go together. I did everything that I was supposed to with the cache as far as putting it in the C: drive and Users folder. In the client folder I tried changing the IP to multiple addresses, 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1, and my no-ip adress. The server is online and I am port forwarded correctly but the client still gives the &quot;Error connecting&quot; message. 

When I try to log in with the client that came with the source and cache it doesn&#39;t show the client attempting to connect on the Server CMD.

I&#39;ve also tried to log in with other clients with no luck but it did show that it was trying to connect on the Server CMD, would show &quot;Encrypted id != 10&quot; over and over until I closed the client.

Edit: I changed all the ports to 43594 as well.</description>
