    <description>Just wondering if there is a time limit I should be aware of before cleaning up some of the server.

There&#39;s a lot of blocks placed in random places, half chopped trees, 2x2 shelters, etc. So far I&#39;m only removing the &quot;damage&quot; done by banned members, but there are some structures that were created &gt; 600 hours ago, by members who aren&#39;t banned.

Should I go ahead and clean those up to, or leave them?</description>

              <p>I would also like to know this as there are a few houses and things that you can’t even call a “Build” that I would like to remove that are quite and eye sore. Also, what about the chests of those people who are banned and/or haven’t played for a while?</p>
