<p>You all are sad, sad individuals, djvawter, you’re reported for offensive language. I never said I was perfect, never claimed to be. I also never said I learned Java in five minutes, in-fact, I’m still learning the language myself and I’ve been learning it for over two years now. The pussy comment? Really? That’s just stupid and ignorant of you, shows your maturity level there kid.</p>
<p>Grow up, this isn’t some daycare center, if you all cannot do the basics don’t come crying for help, there’s a search button and not only that, I’ll <span class="bbcode-b">give</span> you a website where-in-which you can learn the Java programming language from!</p>
