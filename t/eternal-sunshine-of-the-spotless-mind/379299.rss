    <description>This isn&#39;t really a review, but this section seems to be the place to just chat about films anyway. 

I had watched this film back when it first came out (around 2004/2005), but never paid much attention to it while watching it - and after watching it again today, I really do regret not properly watching it the first time around. 

It is a romance film, but not really in the typical sense - it isn&#39;t really what you expect. Watching this after watching inception, it is hard to think that inception didn&#39;t take inspiration from this film - some of its ideas are very similar (except, this film does these parts right, unlike inception).

It is a shame initial impressions of the film based on a few things, like the trailer that makes it look like a silly romantic comedy (which it isn&#39;t) the fact Jim Carrey is one of the two main characters - but please put them aside and just watch it. It is smart, but doesn&#39;t go far into trying to impress the viewer with weird twists, and is very well written - with the acting generally being of a high standard.

I&#39;d highly recommend it, already - I think i&#39;d put it in one of my favourite all time films.
