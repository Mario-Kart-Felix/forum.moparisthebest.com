    <description>[i][b]Hello! Welcome to Valderia. You probably aren&#39;t even reading the description. But anyway, If you are, hello! Welcome to Valderia. Oh wait, I already said that :P. Okay so I&#39;m going to list you the commands and the perms for the commands. No donations are done! Oh and we need 2 Mods and 1 Admin!

--------------------------------

Ranks: [Member] [Moderator] [Admin] [SpecialGuy] [Co-Owner] [Owner].

Here is the nicknames for the ranks and what they stand for:
(We get a lot of questions about it.)

[M] = Member

[M] = Moderator

[A] = Admin

[SG] = Special-Guy

[Co] = Co-Owner

[O] = Owner

---------------------------
Special Perms For Each Rank:

[M] = None

[M] = Tp and Gm

[A] = WorldEdit

[SG] = OP

[Co] = OP

[O] = OP

-------------------------------
Rules:

Don&#39;t grief.

Don&#39;t steal.

Don&#39;t raid.

This is a fun server, be nice.
-------------------------------

Towny Help:

If you want to make a new town you&#39;ll need to get 15,000$. We do have moneydrop so that won&#39;t be hard. After you get the money do /t new &quot;name&quot; in the territory you want it to be the spawn. To change the spawn to /t set townblock THEN /t setspawn. After you do that do /t deposit ($) then do /t claim to claim your territory. YOU CAN BUILD IN THE WILD, THIS SERVER DOESN&#39;T SUCK LIKE THAT!
