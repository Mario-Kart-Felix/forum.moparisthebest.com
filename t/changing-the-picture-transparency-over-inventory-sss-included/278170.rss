    <title>Changing the picture/transparency over inventory? SS&#39;s included</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-picture-transparency-over-inventory-sss-included/278170</link>
    <description>Alright, I have been working on this client for a while, but I am not sure how to edit this picture, as I am not that experienced in client work. If you can help with this issue (Picture Placed Below) then please post. What I really need to know, is just the folder or .java document I need to change it in. I have gone through ALL of my pictures in my client, none have anything to do with this. So my guess is, that the picture was placed with a link. Yet, I need to know where the link is.

Any help at ALL is appreciated, please do not flame, as I am newer to the client making.

Thanks,
