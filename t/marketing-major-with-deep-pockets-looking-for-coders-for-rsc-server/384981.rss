    <title>Marketing Major with Deep Pockets Looking For Coders. [For RSC Server]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/marketing-major-with-deep-pockets-looking-for-coders-for-rsc-server/384981</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve played RSC for a long time, and private servers after that - Poor management, Poor financial planning, and a lot of factors contribute to the downfall of almost every private server.

What I&#39;m looking for is experienced coders that are able to get things done to help me on a project I&#39;ve been wanting to do for a long time.

If it all goes on well this won&#39;t be a 1 month server, I will pay to have it up for a year (No matter what happens) and we can take it from there.

EDIT: Also if you&#39;ve created your own server and want to pitch it to me via PM I can help you get it up online (DDOS Protection, the whole nine yards) and we will discuss the details more thoroughly. I&#39;m open to ideas.</description>

The trick is having an incentive for them to continue subscribing, say on RSCAngel for example, my friends subscribed until they got flats (1-2 months) and then never subscribed again so it was mainly only people training that bothered subscribing. As soon as they achieved what they wanted to achieve there was no other reason to continue subscribing.[/quote]<br>
40 online and yet half are subs.</p>
<p>And with constant new players joining daily and new subs daily</p>

<p>You illegally distribute a client that contains graphics belonging to a company you have absolutely no authorization from to release. That is a violation of the WIPO Copyright laws and you can be prosecuted if Jag(e)x actually cared to pursue litigation on something so insignificant. You also changed the copyright information from the game, which is an even bigger offense.

<p>First get the server running and then you should worry about the audience. Your target audience while you are in development is Mopar and should remain that way until it is completely done. Just my two sense.</p>

<p>As for the topic, I don’t see there being much a point in attempting to establish a realistic server nowadays, the scene as a whole seems rather dead. You’d need something that could revitalize this and a coder with the backbone to make the update efficient which is very rare… Though I guess it doesn’t hurt trying (lol)</p>

<p>Because there’s nothing on my server that violates the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
<p>Also people vote on the RuneScape Top 100 all the time to get subscribed which changes their forum rank to the same rank as if they actually bought the subscription. Sometimes it can look impressive but after all the out goings, charge backs and other non-sense it’s really not that much at all. Don’t get me wrong there’s by far enough to keep it going but don’t exaggerate and claim it’s a salary as I certainly wouldn’t ever consider leaving my job for it…</p>
<p>On topic… If you want to make money off RSC you have got to put a serious amount of work into it. There’s no point making a PK server or anything like that, you need something that players are prepared to paid for and more XP/items is all that’s available really. By selling items they become more and more common until they’re worthless so your only option is to allow them to subscribe for faster XP which is how RSCDaemon/RSCAngel/RSCEmulation generated/generates revenue. There’s a tiny community in the RSC scene so not to sound big headed but unless RSCEmulation closes down or there’s a server releases that is significantly better than everyone flocks to (which is unlikely because lots of people simply cannot be bothered to re-train everything) it just isn’t going to happen. Even if you have 50+ online players barely any of them will subscribe, take a look at RSCAftermath’s userlist for example… 32 players online, 1 subscriber and 3 staff…[/quote]<br>
Before you ever did the 30min per voting you were still getting about over 10 pages of subscribers(50 per page)…  You’ve been raising your prices for subs so I’m guessing it’s at like 7$ right now? 500x7 = 3500 dollars. And tons and TONS of people buy subs on your server just to change there name, transfer to forum account and reset stats. So you’re saying about 5,000 dollars a month isn’t enough to live on?</p>
<p>You live at home with your mom, we all know you don’t have a real job… You’ve boughten a bike, a car all from RSCE subscribers money and you even payed 5,000 dollars for some worthless facebook advertising. Yeah bro, you don’t make nothing. Who the fuck are you trying to fool?</p>

… Almost all the graphics on your server is intellectual property of Jag(e)x and DMCA laws from America have nothing do it with it really. Every RSPS is a violation of the WIPO Copyright Treaty (specifically section 1202) and Jag(e)x could (if they actually cared to pursue it) issue your hosting provider with a cease and desist notice. The problem they have is actually pursuing a complete shutdown and takeover of your domain. It’s a complete waste of resources for a company that generates thousands of dollars in profit a day.</p>

meh. They don’t care for the problems. If they ever released rsc to free again then they would shut them down. But they can’t be bothered</p>

              <p>I’ve played RSC for a long time, and private servers after that - Poor management, Poor financial planning, and a lot of factors contribute to the downfall of almost every private server.</p>
<p>What I’m looking for is experienced coders that are able to get things done to help me on a project I’ve been wanting to do for a long time.</p>
<p>If it all goes on well this won’t be a 1 month server, I will pay to have it up for a year (No matter what happens) and we can take it from there.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also if you’ve created your own server and want to pitch it to me via PM I can help you get it up online (DDOS Protection, the whole nine yards) and we will discuss the details more thoroughly. I’m open to ideas.</p>
