    <title>RuneScape HD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-hd/219354</link>
    <description>Well, with the new runescape HD release, i was just wondering, would it be possible to get those graphics. and above all, why dont we need hundreds of files for graphics in our clients (i dont mean sprites)? What database are we connected to and how can we connect to runescapes to get the new graphics, if its possible without alerting them &quot;Hey look! Im stealing your graphics!&quot;.

Well just wondering, this probably didnt make much sense... and if anybody says: thats what the models are for!, no, its not. Models are the new items tooken from runescape, basically hacked from it. Then you need to import them, which, as far as Im concerned is having a graphic (see above)

and who in there right minds would import all the new graphics and code them into their server, unless they have a lot of time on their hands  :|</description>

              <p>well first of all why would you want the HD Definition like that makes java really slow … and not even jagex has perfect HD client like when it looks to see if your graphics card has required power it can never be fully accurate because there are so many types of graphics card HD is something that you would see in a C++ based kinda thing not java… just was not built for it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
