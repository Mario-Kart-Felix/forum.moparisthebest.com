        <blockquote>For those who do not know, RuneScape Classic is the name we now use to refer to the very first version of RuneScape, the original basis for RuneScape as it is today. As discussed in the RuneTek 5 blog, RuneScape Classic was RuneTek 2. When we upgraded the game engine to RuneTek 3, we renamed the first game to RuneScape Classic, and the RT3 engine took over the RuneScape moniker.
That RT3 engine has long since evolved, through RT4 (High Details) and the now all-encompassing RT5 (the version of RuneScape we all play today). But we do still run a version of RuneScape Classic on our servers for those people who have continued to play it over the years. We’re currently working on a project to revamp RuneScape Classic and open it up again to everyone who wants to play.
Introduction from Mod Mark
<p>Baxtorian Falls, Classic-style<br>
Mod Mark: When Mod MMG joined the company, the first thing he and I spoke about was RuneScape Classic (often just called ‘Classic’). He wanted to know more about this “retro” version of RuneScape, and was surprised when I told him we had closed account creation, but that the game was still running. Despite the fact we had not supported the product for years (with updates), we still had an active player base. He was keen for me to liaise with the other Classic fans in the company to work out what needed to be fixed in order for us to relaunch it.<br>
This was the best news I had heard in ages, because Classic has always been very important to us as a company, and as individual players of the game. Without Classic, the current versions of RuneScape simply would not exist. It made us who we are today. Not supporting it was really quite painful for us, but it had just become impossible to support due to the movement in technologies in the new version of the game. I’ll hand you over to Mod Jack H, the developer for this project, to give some more details.<br>
Over to the developer</p>
<p>Classic ‘Claws of Guthix’<br>
I have to admit it was a bit of a surprise when I was told that I would now be working on RuneScape Classic! The game had not been updated for years, only a few people who had worked on it were still with the company, and nobody could really remember the details of how it worked. But Classic was about to become the basis for a totally new idea for Jagex: player-owned virtual servers. But I’m getting ahead of myself…<br>
My first job was to get Classic into a state in which we could release it again. The Jagex systems which handle updating and releasing new content and game engine updates have moved on a long way since Classic was last released. In order to be able to make changes to the game again, I had to fit it out with the same systems that RuneScape uses to handle things like loading the game code, downloading the content (such as maps, 3D models and sprites), managing your Friends and Ignore lists, and sending abuse reports. I also had to add support for the new display names system that Mod Duncan is working on, and we got some bonuses, like the ability to private chat between Classic and RS2.<br>
So far, we would have had to do all this anyway, because the display names project affects all our games (including Classic), so it had to be updated to support it and we had to be able to release it again. But Andrew and Mod MMG had much bigger ideas for Classic. They wanted to make it available to new players again, and solve the problems that caused it to be restricted in the first place.<br>
The problem that needed solving was how to stop the macroing which was crippling Classic without changing the game. We didn’t want to add to Classic all the measures to stop macroing and cheating that we’ve developed for RuneScape, because that would stop Classic being Classic. We could have just enabled all the cheat codes in the game so macroing would become pointless, but that would make the game quite pointless too. So here’s what we came up with…<br>
And then over to you…?</p>
<p>Demon Slayer’s first incarnation<br>
How about if players could rent and administer their own Classic servers? As a server owner, you could enable or disable any cheat codes you liked, add people to the invite list or banned list, or give individual friends any privileges you liked within your world. In this way, the activities of macroers would become pointless, as you could go on to a cheating-enabled world and get all the stuff you wanted for free if you wanted, but there would still be worlds where you’d have the satisfaction of knowing you worked for your stuff. I should explain that your character would be saved separately for each world, so you couldn’t cheat on one world then use the stuff you gained on a non-cheating world. The different rules set by the owner of each world would really make each world a different game, with different people in positions of power, wielding cheat codes and unleashing Classic’s most awesome spells and items, or making everyone work to get ahead…<br>
Finally, to reassure our loyal Classic members who’ve stuck with the game all the way through, these new ‘player-run’ Classic worlds will be in ADDITION to the two restricted Classic worlds we already operate. We plan to leave those unchanged and not invaded by lots of newcomers or cheat codes.<br>
We reckon this will be a lot of fun, but what do you think of the idea? It’s going to be a lot of work for us to make it a reality as we’ve never done anything like this before. Would you rent a server? How much would you be willing to pay? What sort of features would you want to see? Do you have any other comments or suggestions? Let us know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My impression is that Jagex is attempting to not actually release their server code to renters so they can run their own server but instead give them “access” to an individual world server where they pay per month. I theorize they will be given administrator rank  and granted access to a control panel in game which would let them do various administrator/pmod related tasks like spawn money, change levels, ect. (Similar to what we have seen in EasyRSC somewhat) This would involve Jagex hosting the world servers and not giving access to the actual server code unless they instead sent a binary executable which contains the world server for players to host on their own dedicated servers. That would then require an activation login in order to launch it as long as the user has paid for their rental month.</p>
<p>Who would play on these private rental servers? RS2 noobs and RSC lovers.<br>
Who would run these rental servers? Every non-coding person who runs EasyRSC/related.</p>
<p>To me this sounds like they want to get server owners to rent from them and abandon development in return for a more complete server which has all the quests and everything working. They make profit, we loose potential coders, people stop playing these private servers, rsc development stagnates.</p>
<p>Win win win for Jagex, fail for RSC development. Pretty sinister.</p>

        <p>It’s interesting. In all likeihood it won’t happen for months though. They will need to code a control panel etc. They have also said that you won’t be able to make changes (said by jack h, the only developer).</p>
<p>Then there will probably be a bunch of servers, so the players will spread out massively. There’ll be an initial influx of RS2 players who will quickly get bored.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how viable it would be to rent and maintain the servers at a reasonable price either. Most people won’t want to pay dedi prices and I doubt they can put many servers on a single dedi.</p>
<p>They wouldn’t give database access, it would be doutful if they’d integrate it into player owned forums/website as well so there would be no centralisation for server owners.</p>

        <p>They shut down Dodian but look at what they were doing. Dodian was heavily into subscriptions at $5/month which was eating into their actual profits. Dodian was a very, very large server.</p>
<p>For Jagex to rent out servers, maybe that would be through giving access based on player slots. It is very common to see various game servers for rent based on how many player slots there are. An example: <a href="http://www.gameservers.com/game_servers" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.gameservers.com/game_servers</a></p>
<p>CounterStrike for $0.79/slot. 20 slots = $15.80/month. 100 slots = $79/month.</p>
<p>Runescape Classic servers honestly don’t use that much RAM, CPU, nor bandwidth even. (Ignoring DDoS floods).</p>
<p>Lower the cost to around $0.35/player slot and suddenly $35/month for a 100 player server limit is quite fiscally viable. How many servers do you know that even have that many players on at all times?</p>
<p>Remember back to around 2004 when RSC was very popular and each world held around 2000 players. Lets say that each world was a single dedicated server they had rented out. In 2004, how much RAM/CPU power/bandwidth was available at semi-average prices? Probably an average of around 1.5ghz CPU and 1gb of RAM with 1000 GB a month of bandwidth data transfer for about $200/month maybe? Based on the probability that their world servers are more optimized than ours, I conclude that their cost per player would amount to $0.10/player slot. Multiply that by ~30 worlds would be around $6,000/month in dedicated server costs. That would mean a minimum of 1200 players would have to have a monthly Runescape Members subscription each month to just break even. In May 2006, Runescape broke 1 million subscribers only two years later. $5 million in monthly profit before expenses. Based on those numbers, I would say in 2004 they had a whole lot more than 1200 members subscriptions/month.</p>
<p>They are in the position to host a large number of the rental world servers themselves and not have to hand over a server program to anyone to host on their own. Why bother with giving database access, most don’t care/know how to utilize it. They could offer integrated forums but is that even needed? Runescape Clans host their own forums or just register at free forum hosts like <a href="http://invisionfree.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Invisionfree.com</a> and that works fine for them.</p>
<p>The blogger mentioned integration of player names into a global friends list. By keeping all the world servers on their dedicated servers, they can have each one check into a listening server which communicates with the RS2 listening server. See your friends on the friends list in any world…</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t want to put more than 4-5 100 player servers on one dedi and that is assuming that their software is much more optimised than RSCD. At 375$ per dedi that’s quite a low profit margin for the amount of time required to make it happen and the amount of people I believe would actually rent a server for more than 1-2 months.</p>
<p>Plus they’re going to have to invest time in supporting the servers when they go down/crash/owners need support</p>

        <p>maybe some 1337 dude will find a way to leak the full rsc source…</p>
<p>who knows. this will mess up rsc dev though</p>
<p>what i dont get it why leave alone the last 2 remaining servers only like 60 people play its stupid</p>
<p>a much better idea for jagex to make money would be to reset rsc and make it a funorb game then just have a team of mods.</p>
<p>they will get many more funorb subs.</p>
<p>at least rsc botting will be revived with these servers<br>
i still remember the old days of Richyt</p>

No, they don’t want cheating and macroing that they have to take responsibility for. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
They want to wash their hands of it.</p>

<blockquote>they should have just gpl'd it like wtf why don't they just gpl it riots varrock world 66 24/7 until jagex gpl the rsc code</blockquote>

I’m confused about their motives. They don’t want a cheating server. And they don’t want people macroing. Their answer?</p>
<p>Allow people to make thier own servers either with “cheating” or macroing?</p>
<p>GJ Jagex…</p>
<p>Just open up RSC and make everyone happy, a much better idea.<br>
[/quote]<br>
No, they don’t want cheating and macroing that they have to take responsibility for. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
They want to wash their hands of it.</p>
<p>I had this to say to a friend, in jest of course:</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>they should have just gpl’d it like wtf why don’t they just gpl it riots varrock world 66 24/7 until jagex gpl the rsc code</p>

</aside>
<p>Seriously. They’re a private company; if it doesn’t line their pockets then it doesn’t happen.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t see why they don’t just open (new) RSC servers for paying customers only and state that there is no support for the game. If you get hacked/scammed/pissed off at botters, tough.</p>
