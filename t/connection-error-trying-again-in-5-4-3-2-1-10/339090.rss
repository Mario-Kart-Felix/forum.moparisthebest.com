    <title>Connection Error - Trying Again in 5...4....3....2..1.......10</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-error-trying-again-in-5-4-3-2-1-10/339090</link>
    <description>Ok, I got a new source that was actually simple enough for me (I&#39;m a new coder and I want to get used to stuff instead of being confused going through bin files and stuff like that. Well, I changed the IP and it actually worked. It says it&#39;s online. I am not sure if this is an anti-leech, but when I download the client from a different computer and click run, it goes &quot;Connection Error - Trying Again in 5...4....3....2..1.......10..........&quot; an increased by 5 everytime. I do not know what this is. Does anybody else know?  :confused:</description>

              <p>That is a client side error and is to do with either the background image, sprite or cache.<br>
I would try using a new client if you are somewhat inexperienced, as it would save time.</p>

              <p>solution 1: did yu change ip when yu downloaded it on another computer?</p>
<p>solution 2: is the cache file in the c:/ file (think all cache files need to go here)</p>
<p>solution 3: get another client (yu can use mine if yu need 2, i am currently working on a 508)</p>
<p>solution 4: ask creator of client (if yu didn’t make it)</p>
