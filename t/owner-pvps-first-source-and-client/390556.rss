    <description>[i]Hey my name is Pvp and ive been working off of combatscape&#39;s source and let me tell u it sucked i mean home was too crowded and shops where not worth having so i fixed them and added commands such as ::home ::shops :: cook there was no cooking place so i added that also ::staffzone left empty so u can add crap in it. ::train ::talk talk is where u chill and have convo&#39;s with people without getting too crowded at home. There was a few things like drop rates and junk i fixed up.
here&#39;s what the source has dclaws with 4 spec =P Ags with perfect spec and same for other godswords. The rest of the server you will have to see for your self =P [/i]
Link for server = http://www.mediafire.com/?6z6ajqzy8ay82s6
Link for client = http://www.mediafire.com/?k2l556s861t9k20
credits for me 4%
the rest goes to the owners of combaatscape</description>

              <p>Looks boring.<br>
If I were to log into this, I’d walk around… Take a look at things, level up a bit, log out, and I won’t come back the next day.<br>
Add something unique that not all servers have. I really don’t like the login bots. Just make server messages, like sendMessage(“your message…”); or sM(“blah”); - By something unique, I mean not just a cooking zone - sounds boring. A talking zone… Just talk to people right next to you, no need for that area. Make maybe… a combat arena. You fight players inside that arena and when you die you spawn next to the arena, like in RS house parties. Or, maybe a custom minigame with NPCs and you have to grab a key inside of a box, always in a random spot each time, out of maybe 50 boxes with level 230s on your ass hitting a max of 60. Something unique, you know?</p>
<p>Just my opinion.</p>

              <p>Going to be honest, combatscape was crap but this really isn’t a lot better. You still have like 12 shops(11?)</p>
<p>I miss these type of servers a lot but never understood why people needed a “chill” area, nor a “cook” area.</p>
<p>Think I will pass on downloading this one, but good luck on future stuff. Don’t misunderstand though, I am not flaming or anything just feedback. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
