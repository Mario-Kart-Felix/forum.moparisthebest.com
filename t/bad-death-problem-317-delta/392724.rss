    <title>Bad death problem. 317 Delta</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bad-death-problem-317-delta/392724</link>
    <description>Hello, currently when a player dies from anything (including NPC&#39;s) They are awarded 5 PK points. I think this may only be for normal players (Not admins or owners). Also if a player in the same room as you dies from a npc that you are also attacking, you are awarded PKP and it says &quot;You have killed ...&quot;. This was tested on Bandos. This is real bad for my server and I have no idea what to look for in order to fix this..

This was the only code I could find involving + 5 PKP
[code]		}
		if (!IsInFightCave() &amp;&amp; !isInPitGame() &amp;&amp; !isInPitRoom() &amp;&amp; playerRights != 2 &amp;&amp; playerRights != 3 &amp;&amp; action != 1 &amp;&amp; deathStage == 2 &amp;&amp;  System.currentTimeMillis() - deathTimer &gt;= 2500) {
		client killerz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[KillerId];
		youdied();
		killerz.rating += 15;
		killerz.sM(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+playerName+&quot;.&quot;);
		killerz.pkPoints += 5;
