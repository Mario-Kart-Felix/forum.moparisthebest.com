    <title>NPC Keep walking 718 Please help REP++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-keep-walking-718-please-help-rep/506689</link>
    <description>I have tried many things and many tutorials but nothing will work.
My problem is that I will set some NPC&#39;s to a location, and I want them to not move, but I can&#39;t seem to get it to work.
Things I have tried:
- I went into the NPCSpawning.java and set everything to false, example: World.spawnNPC(659, new WorldTile(3160, 3489, 0), -1, false, false);
- I went into the NPC.java and set all the RandomWalks to false, example: if(id == 659) setRandomWalk(false);
- I also went into the unpackedSpawnsList.txt and added all the coords, etc.
Is there anything I need to do or didn&#39;t do? Help would be appreciated and will be rewarded with a rep++
Thanks.</description>
