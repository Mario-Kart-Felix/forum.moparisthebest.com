    <title>Toplist Project - Freely Available</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/toplist-project-freely-available/547539</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve decided to get back into the PHP side of things. I am currently working on a toplist script that will freely be available around the communities. Currently the list is in early dev mode and I&#39;ll update this thread every so often (probably the end of the day) with little snippets of code and what not for everyone to critique and look at.

	$html = $tpl-&gt;draw( &#39;index&#39;, $return_string = true );
	
    echo $html;

    class str{
	
        function cut($t){
		
			return substr($t, 1, 2 );
			
		}
		
	}

EDIT: Decided the admin panel looked too much like IPB to the point it may cause problem, switched to Bootstrap. Should allow me to develop quicker aswell. :)</description>

Make a cool control panel and they won’t need to invest into learning php! Most noobies use php because their crappy $2 webserver can’t run rails <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>So are 99% of the other applications on the market… and the majority of people looking for a product can’t program it themselves so they search up “PHP Toplist”. Sooooooo, what’s the point here? Lol.</p>

              <p>I’ve decided to get back into the PHP side of things. I am currently working on a toplist script that will freely be available around the communities. Currently the list is in early dev mode and I’ll update this thread every so often (probably the end of the day) with little snippets of code and what not for everyone to critique and look at.</p>

<p>EDIT: Decided the admin panel looked too much like IPB to the point it may cause problem, switched to Bootstrap. Should allow me to develop quicker aswell. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
