              <p>pillreports is decent. But by no means should you take it too seriously.</p>
<p>There’s many different batches of the same pill presses. A good pill makes a good name for itself, then all of a sudden u’ve got spinoffs flooding in that are loaded with speed etc.</p>
<p>It’s nice when you find reports though from your region, that have been tested with marquis etc, and have a good clear picture of the pill from the front, back, and side. For example you could have a blue pill with a teddybear on it. Maybe one batch is good clean mdma, and the other is a dirty speed bomb. Maybe the difference between the pills in appearence is that one has rounded edges on the side, and one doesn’t. So you need to pay a lot of attention to details. You can’t just go looking up blue teddys and assume that they are the same as yours.</p>
<p>Generally everyone in this market is uninformed and stupid when it comes to drugs. People who you think you could trust to know what they are talking about, often don’t. But that all depends who you know.</p>

<p>RE: your pill - <a href="http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=17729" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.pillreports.com/index.php?page=display_pill&amp;id=17729</a></p>
<p>I take enough MDMA to know what it is and isn’t, I feel bad for you if you have taken a pip <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> drink about 2 pints of water and try neck 2 valium so you dont have to deal with the shit pip feeling.</p>
<p>only get pills and MDMA from reliable, trusted people. be prepared to pay top dollar for the real deal too, dont jew out on going for the cheap option as there is a reason why it is cheap!</p>
<p>also, get the marquis test Mopman kindly posted, as it is very very useful if you want to test pills so you know what your putting into your body before you actually do!</p>
<p>Stay safe and good luck on your adventure.</p>
