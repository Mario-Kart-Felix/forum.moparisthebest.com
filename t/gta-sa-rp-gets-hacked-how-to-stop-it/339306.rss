    <title>GTA SA:RP gets hacked. [how to stop it]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gta-sa-rp-gets-hacked-how-to-stop-it/339306</link>
    <description>Can someone answer me, how can a GTA server even get hacked.
What way do they use to hack it?
Can someone help me find the solution and fix it? I&#39;ve had it, they hack us everyday and we get a rollback.
The hackers get online and ban everyone for a stupid reason, like: anti-fag etc, or they make everyone admin. Can someone help?!</description>

<p>It is not for me, but for a gta server I play: <a href="http://www.gtasarp.com/forums/index.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.gtasarp.com/forums/index.php</a><br>
It gets hacked almost everyday by a same server because they have an argue with each other.<br>
The reall SA:RP had very much players but 1 admin left the game to make his own server.<br>
Some other admins went with him, well they made the SAME server as the reall SA:RP.<br>
Now they’re hacking the server, on to try to get the players back by banning everyone and promising them stuff.<br>
That’s very annoying because we get rollbacks, that’s why I wanted help to know why and how the server gets hacked, and how to fix it. Because it is very annoying for everyone on the server. Since I am new to Gta servers, I can’t really do anything because I am not experienced enough to.</p>
