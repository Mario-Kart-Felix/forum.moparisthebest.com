    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;NuBia website tour is now over, maybe you can see next time  ;). Next time will be bigger then ever though, so dont be sad :).

Will a moderator please close this thread btw? Thx&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hi Hi,

Yeah I coded the site but its not done 100% cuz I have to edit so much. One of my m8s who will be helping me code this site is 18 yrs old and he knows a load of website coding languages so heh. Its not functional, some parts of missing most links dont work but about 3 or 4 pages work. Hope you see this! Link will be removed before I go to sleep for personal reasons, dont comment about copyright or anything, just r8.

Thanks

Like I said before, dont comment about copyright we know that and so does everyone else who make private servers. Right, rate me right or prepare to fight the dikes in the back of my car. OK? Alright.</description>

              <p>Dude, I read a article like 3 months ago about how google rank websites. And a saw a lot of website that buy websites based on the population it has…</p>
<p>Like they dont just buy the template, its like saying if someone wanted to buy <a href="http://www.runescape.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.runescape.com/</a> that wut I mean, they buy the game along with it too which total out to be a lot.</p>
<p>And popularity of a whole website is based on links, why you think people be using those wierd ad links that go to advertised pages like ebay items and stuff. Its pretty obvious, I do know wut im talking bout. I even talked to a SEO bout it. And if your the type of person who blogs you would know that posting links a lot on your website is a must because those are ways to get people to click adsenses so they profit - its kind of a way to say to someone like “Hey click this link for a special offer” but he doesnt tell them when he clicks it he gets paid some cents for adsense… Yeah. Even the guy who owns <a href="http://www.gimp-tutorials.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.gimp-tutorials.com/</a> told me that too, he doesnt use them for no reason when he post guides. How you think the site is so managed and still up there eh? Well I’m just not gonna say anything because a lot of people dont even do the research on this, but I seriously am happy to be proven wrong.</p>
<p>Theres also another reason why forums get ranked so quickly on google too, google ranks you if you have enough links on your website. W3C doesn’t have a link checker for no reason, its there for many other useful reasons.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>And either way there has already been an exact copy of the website done(that Mikey dude who made a Runescape php template for people to download, yeah him), mines is 100% modified. No where against exact, plus my website is like 1/4 bigger then Runescape website, sized.</p>
