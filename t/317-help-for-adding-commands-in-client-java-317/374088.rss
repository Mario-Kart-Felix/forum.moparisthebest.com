    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-help-for-adding-commands-in-client-java-317/374088</link>
    <description>Hey guys! i really need help with this. ive tried my own ways to do it. but anyways on to the problem. Im coding a 317, And theres more commands in 317. That have to be changed to your name. Example:

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;interface&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Owner Kid&quot;))
                  {[/code]

I want to know how to put in the name where &quot;owner kid&quot; is. I wanna know how to put 2 names. !The Correct Way! I tried it my way. And i got error&#39;s when i compiled. Please help?</description>
