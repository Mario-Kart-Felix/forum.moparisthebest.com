    <title>Need Some Help With BCEL Updater Creation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-help-with-bcel-updater-creation/270976</link>
    <description>Hi, I require some help with BCEL Updater Creation. 

From what I&#39;ve read around the forums I realize that people will not release a updater that works. I find it hard for me to learn if I have no idea what a updater should or might look like. 
Fortunately I was able to find a few updaters that were incomplete and I&#39;ve started to break them down.   

Currently I&#39;m looking at thebanks simple updater (Located: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,288851.0.html). I see that it is very simple indeed and really gives me nothing else to jump off of. 

Note: For all intents and purposes I&#39;ve read ever guide on this site word for word. And have been using google as a reference. 

If anyone could introduce me to a more complete yet simple updater it would be most helpful. Or perhaps point me in a direction with thebanks&#39; simple updater. I&#39;m always looking for better and more efficient ways to learn and nothing is too difficult with a guide or outline. So anything is appreciated; but I prefer something to the lines of thebanks&#39; style.   

Thanks for all you help and consideration  ;)</description>

<p>I stated that I required some insight on where to continue. At no point did I ask for you to give me every step by step process. Learning it is what I need to take up by myself but pointing me to a direction is a decent request I believe.</p>
<p><code>I'm sorry for annoying you, I'll wait for someone else to help point me in a direction.</code></p>
