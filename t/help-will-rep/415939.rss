    <description>Okay so i&#39;m trying to add this Interface but it wont show up. I&#39;m not very good with interfaces I really don&#39;t see how they work, but i&#39;m trying. So what I need help with is this. I want to make the interface to pop up when I do ::interface 9460 just to see that it works. I tried doing that command with other ones and it worked so yeah. This is my code that I put in RSInterface.java [code]	public static void vShop(RSFont[] rsFonts){
		RSInterface Interface = addTabInterface(9460);
		setChildren(12, Interface);		
		addSprite(9461, 0, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;);			
		addHover(9462, 3, 0, 8463, 1, &quot;Bank/BANK&quot;, 17, 17, &quot;Close Shop!&quot;);
		addHovered(9463, 2, &quot;Bank2/BANK&quot;, 17, 17, 3827);
		addButton(9466, 1, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy Pak Yak Pouch (10Points)&quot;, 1);
		addButton(9467, 2, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy Spirit Terrorbird Pouch (10Points)&quot;, 1);
		addButton(9468, 3, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy Steel Titan Pouch (10Points)&quot;, 1);		
		addButton(9469, 4, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy 3rd Age Mage Hat (50Points)&quot;, 1);
		addButton(9470, 5, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy 3rd Age Robe Top (50Points)&quot;, 1);	
		addButton(9471, 6, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy 3rd Age Robe Bottom (50Points)&quot;, 1);
		addButton(9472, 7, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy Dark Bow (70Points)&quot;, 1);	
		addButton(9473, 8, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy Dragon Claws (70Points)&quot;, 1);
		addButton(9474, 9, &quot;User/VOTE&quot;, 95, 19, &quot;Buy Dragonfire Shield (70Points)&quot;, 1);
		setBounds(9461, 12, 12, 0, Interface);
		setBounds(9462, 471, 22, 1, Interface);
		setBounds(9463, 471, 22, 2, Interface);
		setBounds(9466, 27, 125, 3, Interface);//this is where it starts
		setBounds(9467, 127, 125, 4, Interface);
		setBounds(9468, 226, 125, 5, Interface);
		setBounds(9469, 27, 205, 6, Interface);
		setBounds(9470, 127, 205, 7, Interface);
		setBounds(9471, 226, 205, 8, Interface);
		setBounds(9472, 27, 285, 9, Interface);
		setBounds(9473, 126, 285, 10, Interface);
		setBounds(9474, 227, 285, 11, Interface);//this is where it ends
	}	[/code]
I get no compiling errors at all but as I said it doesn&#39;t show up. Am I forgetting to put another kind of code somewhere? As I said i&#39;m new to interfaces.
