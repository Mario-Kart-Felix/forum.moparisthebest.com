    <title>Need teleport &amp; command help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-teleport-command-help/286773</link>
    <description>Okay everybody, these problem may seem easy to you guys but I haven&#39;t the slightest how to do them. I am quite new at coding and i&#39;m trying so please be patient if you&#39;re trying to help

Firstly, I&#39;d like to make a &quot; PK&quot; teleport.
I set up the textHandler etc.
I want it like when you click it, a choice comes up like when talking to an npc saying 
Edgeville
Varrock
Mage Bank

and when you click one of the options it directs you. Whever I try these ones I get so confused so i figured to ask for some help.

Next I wanted to make like a command ::lockexp for low level pures and etc. If anybody knows how and could tell me i&#39;d be very grateful
