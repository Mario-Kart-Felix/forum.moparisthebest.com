    <title>Project Nemesis</title>

    <description>OK, well it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been back into coding. (Was camping for a few days, it&#39;s a lot of fun). These are the things I&#39;ve added, and things I need to fix/add.

HOW I GOT THE NAME &quot;NEMESIS!&quot;:
Well, I was messing around on MySpace, watching UnderOATH videos, and I found an Arch Enemy one, and I watched it, amazed at how a hot chick can have amazing heavy metal vocals, and the songs name was &quot;Nemesis&quot; so I decided to use that as the name.

WEBSITE: www.nemesisserver.co.nr

99 max skill
126 max combat
Prayer
Client
Fletching-Need a better version
Woodcutting-Removed due to bugs
Herblore
Agility-Buggy still
Cooking
Fishing
Mining
Smithing
Gambling
Gold Dust
No portals
Renamed teleporting places, so use those to get to KBD, Jad, Dragons, Wildy, etc!
No item commands
EXTREMELY challenging, I&#39;m talking like 50 EXP per hit on a NPC.
Most items are found by killing NPC&#39;s
Kalphite Queen RARELY drops Dragon Chain and 2h. Maybe 1/50 chance, and has over 780 HP!
Jad RARELY drops Fire Cape, talking a 1/20 chance, and I&#39;ll make him 500 HP.
King Black Dragon drops Dragon Medium Helmet, pretty rare.
Steel Dragons drop Dragon Legs, and Dragon Square, EXTREMELY RARE!
Torso Minigame (Not hard, lowest lvl I&#39;ve done it at is like 40 lol). Will work on this
NO ITEM COMMANDS I FUCKING HATE THOSE
NO ADMIN ONLY OR MOD ONLY COMMANDS!
Only commands are ::yell, ::kick, and ::bank I believe.
Stores are pretty much obsolete, so you&#39;ll start off with only the gear needed.
Click on the skill you want to learn info about, brings it up from a text document. CREDITS TO VORARG!
377 cache&#39;d client
Working Fire Capes
New Admin and Mod icons
Head Icons (Prayer)
NO ITEM COMMANDS-I&#39;m just so happy!

Things to get done:
Thieving
Crafting
Runecrafting
Farming
Slayer
Fix NPC hits.
Fix hitting on NPC&#39;s. I.E.-If a man has 7 hp, you can&#39;t hit over 7 on him.
Fixing Ice Barrage (doesn&#39;t work for some reason).
Better weapon animation
Make it more challenging, and maybe a new NPC with over 8K HP that 1/30 kills drops a partyhat.
NO-IP WON&#39;T WORK FOR ME, unless someone can help me with port-forwarding, I&#39;ve done it, but I don&#39;t know what to put for the TCP port part.
Better background for client-DONE, I just messed around in PS for my first 20 minutes and made stupid patterns.

POST SUGGESTIONS! If I see item commands, or faster training, I&#39;ll give ya a good talkin&#39; to about it, the only fun part about pservs, is the challenge, am I right? It&#39;s no fun being 126-253 cmb in 30 seconds.

Credits so far:
5% Vorarg for the Skill Menus
5% to whoever made the Gold Dust
35% to Wolf for the base
55% to me for adding in custom Fishing, Cooking, Smithing, Mining, and Herblore.</description>
