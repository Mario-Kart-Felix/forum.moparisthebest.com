    <title>[639] Dementhium - Poison Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-dementhium-poison-help/537006</link>
    <description>When certain bosses, such as KBD and a few other custom bosses, use their poison attack, super antipoison doesnt do anything. What I mean by this, is if the boss uses the poison attack, the player can cure themself by drinking super anti, but then they are able to be instantly re-poisoned. I want to make it where they can&#39;t be poisoned again for a short period of time.
-Thanks in advance</description>
