    <title>Full FunPK/Eco Server help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/full-funpk-eco-server-help/543095</link>
    <description>Well the server im a dev for, plans on adding a World 2 and placed me in charge. The thing is the world 2 consists of A full PVP world, but its all funPK and we plan on using the PK points as currency. PLayers would rack up PK points and use them to spend on armour and weapons. I have and idea of how to do it, but I don&#39;t know exactly where to start. I dont need a full tutorial or anything. Just some info just to get me started. Like where to start in all. I know it may sound very confusing, but to those who are kind enough to help me out, Thank you so much.</description>

              <p>Assuming you have the second world set up already, all you’d need to do is make is make everywhere wilderness and create your safe zones in a bank for example. Do this by changing the inWild boolean or whatever you have to determine whether a player is in the wilderness or not.</p>
<p>To make the area fun pk, you’ll need to edit the death method and make sure items aren’t dropped as normal.</p>
