<p>I’d wager it takes 40% less time to script content than write it in java. Easily. And write it incrementally in a clean manner.[/quote]A lot of that comes down to the way your content is designed. The way the source is current written, I wouldn’t doubt that for a second. But there are things you can do to speed up java content development. One of them is of course is the design pattern. Look at something like matrix, it may have a weird and pretty bad content design pattern, but just from looking you can tell its a hellavu lot faster to write than content in the current base. And secondly IDE snippets/content prediction are individually huge, but not as useful as scripting (because obviously there’s a difference between one person having speedier writing vs everyone). I am in awe when I watch people that have been using their API/project for a while in their IDE and how fast they can write their code. You could have something like ‘giveitem’ translate to your big long java code to somewhat replicate scripting even. I wish I had that setup with my IDE</p>

By keep track of I meant it with packaging and file organization mainly, there isn’t many restrictions to how you organize all of this, i.e several different files and folders, since ultimately however you write how it is interpreted handles what you can and can’t do as far as that goes. And at least in my own opinion, a scripting language is easier to learn than your regular high-level OOP language, so somebody who isn’t very good at Java, because he is a beginner, or can’t quite grasp the concepts, could find it easier to write it in Lua, or something. In theory at least.</p>

Look at the awesome responses due to the new scripting language impl. I think you would have more people willing to write scripts if you just kept it in java.<br>

<p>And I think I’ll reiterate the question of why don’t people get it through their skulls that java is NOT a good language to write all this content in.[/quote]That’s an opinion m8, plenty of big servers have loads of content all in java w/o performance issues (which of course all comes down to how your content is designed, its somewhat funny that the poorer designs actually can show performance increases, and also it has been shown that certain scripting interfaces such as jruby are just flat out slower than pure java), people script to write faster and some people dont weigh that speed over having to learn the language</p>
<p>Of course with that said I personally find it interesting and look forward to trying my hand at writing plugins</p>

<p>And I think I’ll reiterate the question of; why don’t people get it through their skulls that java is NOT a good language to write all this content in? What advantages does Java pose as a language for people to script in, other than, it’s well known in the community. A lot of good language practices do not align for ease of access in terms of how content should be written and there are too many variables to couple with content logic in a clean and efficient manner, especially since you want to avoid global state while most scripting languages like Javascript, Lua, and Ruby either have support for globally scoped variables or actually encourage them.</p>
<p>I’m not catering to all of you. I’m catering to those of you who are willing and skilled enough to take advantage of the utility this gives you.</p>
