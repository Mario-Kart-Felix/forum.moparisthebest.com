LYRICS~

The Biggie duets (Uh) 
Jazze Phizzle (phizzle phizzle) 
Jagged Edge 
Biggie Smalls 
Ladies and gentlemen... 

[Biggie Smalls] 
I go, on and on and on and 
Don&#39;t take them to the crib unless they bon&#39;in 
Easy, call em on the phone and 
platinum Chanel cologne and 
I stay, dressed, to impress 
Spark these bitches interest 
Sex is all I expect 
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know 
They know, quarter past fo&#39; 
Left the club tipsy, say no mo&#39; 
Except how I&#39;m gettin home, tomorrow 
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O.(hey) 
Back of my mind, I hope she swallow 
Man She spilt a drink on my cream wallows 
Reach the gate, hungry just ate 
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight 
This must mean she ain&#39;t tryin to wait 
Conversate, sex on the first date I state &quot;You know what you do to me&quot; 
She starts off, &quot;Well I don&#39;t usually&quot; 
Then I, whip it out, rubber no doubt 
Step out, show me what you all about 
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse 
Pull your G-string down South, aoowww 
Threw that back out, in the parking lot 
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top 
And I don&#39;t stop, until I squirt 
Jeans skirt butt-naked it all work 

[Chorus - Jagged Edge] 
Gotta love ma little nasty girl 
U know I love ma little nasty girl 
I love ma little nasty girl 
All the ladies if u hear me 
Grab Ur titties for B.I.G 
I love ma little nasty girl 
All ma women from around the world 
I love ma little nasty girl 
All the ladies if u hear me 
Grab Ur titties for B.I.G 

[P. Diddy] 
I need u to dance 
I need u to strip 
I need u to shake Ur little ass n hips 
I need u to grind like Ur working for tips 
N give me what I need while we listen to prince 
Coz miss U ain&#39;t seen the world yet 
Rocked la pearl yet 
Rocked them pearl sets 
Flew in em pearl jets (ooooohhhhh) 
In a style make a low profile girl smile 
Throw a chick back like a blue print trial 
Now u n me can drink some Hennessy 
Then we get it on 
Mad women wantin to bone Sean combs 
Sippin on Patron 
Speeding we be leanin 
Got em feeling 
N when I give it to u throw it right back (right back) 
Tell me Diddy &#39;Yeah I like it like that&#39; (like that) 
Lift your shirt 
U know how I flirt 
Heels and skirt 
Let&#39;s take it off 
Now lets work (lets work) 

[Chorus] 
Gotta love ma little nasty girl 
U know I love ma little nasty girl 
I love ma little nasty girl 
All the ladies if u hear me 
Grab Ur titties for B.I.G 
I love ma little nasty girl 
All ma women from around the world 
I love ma little nasty girl 
All the ladies if u hear me 
Grab Ur titties for B.I.G 

[Jagged Edge] 
Uh with JE and B.I.G (what, what) 
Grab the keys from Diddy (Uh, uh) 
The women look-in ... no stress 
Meet us upstairs in Ur best .....Yes 
Dressed to impress 
Spark these bitches interest 
Jazze on the beat so sweet 
Ladies know u feel me 
Grab Ur titties for the B.I.G 

[Nelly &amp; Avery Storm] 
Ok ma what&#39;s Ur preference 
Nice and slow 
Or fast and breathless 
Pull Ur hair girl, bite Ur necklace 
Let me show u what a nigger from Louis blessed with 
Hey.... I&#39;m exprained to leave 
When I&#39;m done I flip the mattress 
Change the sheet (Gotta change them) 
I&#39;m like a radical one 
I vibrate a little more than Ur mechanical one 
(From Ur titties to you thong) 
Either way mama I&#39;m a make u do it or do it 
(Girl I&#39;m about to make u come) 
Guaranteed when Ur fuckin with me 
(Coz I go on and on and on...on and on and on....on and on and) 
Ladies if u feel me 
Grab them Thangs fo Biggie 

[Chorus] 
Gotta love ma little nasty girl 
U know I love ma little nasty girl 
I love ma little nasty girl (u Gotta love it baby) 
All the ladies if u hear me 
Grab ur titties for B.I.G
