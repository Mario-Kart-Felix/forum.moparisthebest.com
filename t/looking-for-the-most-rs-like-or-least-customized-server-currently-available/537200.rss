    <title>Looking for the most RS-like or least customized server currently available</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-the-most-rs-like-or-least-customized-server-currently-available/537200</link>
    <description>Hey everyone! I have been kind of out of the loop for a few years and I have decided I really want to get back into messing with runescape servers. In 2006 I had a basic understanding of javascript and html. I got an RSPS from a friend (Whitescape I think?) and started playing with it. I actually work full time as a programmer now and have gained a lot of experience and knowledge, I would really like to see what I can do! 
 
That said, I hate customizations and I would prefer the most RS like server available or just one of the (assuming there is such a thing still) base servers that most people use. I think the last server I really got into messing with was a 317, but I am open to any version, I think... I would also really like a compatible web client, are there any cookie cutter clients available? 
 
Any advice, help, or input is greatly appreciated, thanks very much!</description>

              <p>The only way you’ll find what you’re looking for is starting from scratch. There are many clients, but for a 317/377 client, you can simply use the Moparscape client. Most of the packets have been documented in the wiki, so that takes a nice chunk of the networking research out. The Map format has also been documented by sinisoul, so you have that as well.</p>
