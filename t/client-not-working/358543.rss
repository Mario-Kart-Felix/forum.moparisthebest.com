              <p>well its depending on your router some routers it will allow you to portforward and some websites will say that port ius open. But it dont let people acess port try checking to see if its open at <a href="http://canyouseeme.com" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.com</a>. Then did you change the ip in the client.</p>
