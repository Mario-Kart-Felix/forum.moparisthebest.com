    <title>I need help with 562 source player combat animations (GFX&#39;s), Please help me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-562-source-player-combat-animations-gfxs-please-help-me/415123</link>
    <description>[b]Note[/b]: Please do not rudely tell me to use the search bar to find this because I have done over [b]30[/b] searches for it without any luck.

[b]Source currently used[/b]: Mezzyscape 562 loading 657 source

I noticed all of the proper melee attack styles are messed up on this source. Such as when I go and attack a monster my character&#39;s torso will become invisible for a second. Also magic and range style attack emotes seem incorrect also. However I have downloaded a list of all the common 562 GFX&#39;s. If anyone can please get back to me on where I can plug in the proper GFX codes it would be greatly appreciated!</description>
