    <title>Creating a Modchip for my PSP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-modchip-for-my-psp/393542</link>
    <description>Just looking for some feedback. A while ago, I made a post on MITB about writing a custom kernel for the PSP (school assignment). But, my teacher didn&#39;t give the class enough information to get anywhere close. As it turns out, he just wanted to see how far we could get, so there wasn&#39;t really a &quot;score&quot;.

However, I&#39;m still interested in creating a custom kernel for the PSP. However due to it being my only one, I was wondering if it would be a safer (and more applicable?) to create a &quot;modchip&quot; instead of flashing the NAND. There are a few reasons as to why I would prefer to do this:


[ol][li]By flashing the NAND, I would be erasing all of Sony&#39;s code (including the bootloader). So if I mess something up even once, I&#39;m left with a fancy looking paperweight.[/li]
[li]Since the kernel would be stored on a separate modchip (probably an EEPROM), I can easily reprogram it to my needs. Whether it be to add a new feature, or to fix runtime errors.[/li]
[li]It would not only give me experience working with electronics, it would also help me become a better programmer. It would most likely be written in C/++, probably with some ASM if needed.[/li]
[li]I just think it would be a fun thing to do[/li][/ol]


So if anyone here has any experience/resources with something like this, I would very much appreciate any help you can give.</description>

<p>Awesome, so technically since I’m using the Prometheus 5.50 I should still be able to load all my code from my IPL right?</p>
<p>However, if I were to update to the latest OFW, would that remove my ability to load my custom kernel? Or would I have to patch the OFW files. I’d prefer to chip/CFW to work on any type of PSP. I’m curious if I were to use a chip, if I could hold a button (like Right Trigger/Shoulder/Bumper) and then interrupt the Sony IPL loading process physically.[/quote]<br>
The closest you will get is 6.20 as this is the only firmware with a known perma-patch via pre-IPL. Newer firmwares have a check for this, and wont startup if they detect an error. I would suggest using the TM exploit on your custom Kernel first to make sure it would even startup. This would make it so you wont need a pandora as often is you screwed up. the NOTHING option in the TM can let you boot from the NAND if nothing is pressed.</p>

Then, the other issue would be, would this be a replacement kernel for PSP users to use, or just something for you to use. Also note, the PSP’s shell has barely any room to add lights, let alone a whole new chip. This might require taking out your UMD drive.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well at first it would be for me to use. But then I would start a proper development thread somewhere, and people could use it as they wished. Or I could sell it like a normal xbox modchip or something.</p>
<p>And I know there’s not a whole lot of room. Especially since the Slims+ require that the unit be completely assembled before it will work. Not sure if there’s a pressure sensor, or I’ve just had bad wiring, but when I turned it on while it was disassembled, the light would turn on, but the MS light wouldn’t and the screen wouldn’t turn on.</p>

<p>Not true at all. The all PSP1000’s and some 2000’s [<span class="bbcode-b">all</span> 3000’s and Go’s cannot be hacked with a full CFW, but there is a perma patch for 6.20OFW with a HEN that <span class="bbcode-b">can</span> brick those [not always], and require sending into sony at that point) with the correct motherboards can be un-bricked via a Pandora battery [puts psp into Sony service mode] and Magic Memory Stick (A memory stick that just has the Time Machine exploit [unbrick method used by Sony on these motherboards] to simply re-install CFW or OFW. I used the Time Machine exploit to actually hack my PSP back when I got it 2 years ago.</p>

<p>There is a tool called PSPIdent that can identify all of the information on a PSP. More information on that here:<br>

<p>I have been lingering around the hacking scene for a while now, and can right about tell you hacking methods for each version, and the best way to patch a CFW to work for all games. (5.50D3 with Prometheus-4 patch is what I use, and can play ‘3rd Birthday’ which requires 6.37). Just a tip though, writing your own kernel would mean writing your own firmware from scratch to go with it, as then all normal PSP functions would be crippled because of the changed kernel methods/names to do everything. (I know your not changing, but writing your own, but thats the same point)</p>

<p>Yeah, I’m trying to make something like “Undiluted Platinum”. I can use/test my kernel because I have MIPS emulator.</p>

              <p>Just looking for some feedback. A while ago, I made a post on MITB about writing a custom kernel for the PSP (school assignment). But, my teacher didn’t give the class enough information to get anywhere close. As it turns out, he just wanted to see how far we could get, so there wasn’t really a “score”.</p>
<p>However, I’m still interested in creating a custom kernel for the PSP. However due to it being my only one, I was wondering if it would be a safer (and more applicable?) to create a “modchip” instead of flashing the NAND. There are a few reasons as to why I would prefer to do this:</p>
<p>[ol][li]By flashing the NAND, I would be erasing all of Sony’s code (including the bootloader). So if I mess something up even once, I’m left with a fancy looking paperweight.[/li]<br>
[li]Since the kernel would be stored on a separate modchip (probably an EEPROM), I can easily reprogram it to my needs. Whether it be to add a new feature, or to fix runtime errors.[/li]<br>
[li]It would not only give me experience working with electronics, it would also help me become a better programmer. It would most likely be written in C/++, probably with some ASM if needed.[/li]<br>
[li]I just think it would be a fun thing to do[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>So if anyone here has any experience/resources with something like this, I would very much appreciate any help you can give.</p>
