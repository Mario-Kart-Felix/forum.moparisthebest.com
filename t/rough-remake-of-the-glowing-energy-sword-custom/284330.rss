<p>coon you got to remember the ages on this forums there are alot of kids on here that are just tryign to look “cool” insted they just get pissed off and cry like the little babys they are. reason the people flame is all these kids on here thinking there cool cause they leeched something and posted it calling it there own then they complan about it. lolz but anyways yes he needs banned.[/quote]<br>
<span class="mention">@OFFTOPIC</span> - Yea, but the word has spread about Moparscape. We will be getting <span class="bbcode-u">[b]ALOT</span> of people like him, (not to mention there is alot more in the server sections than we have here). I, personally, am only able to keep my cool because of my life and how it is. Ive been thrown around by my parents and stuff, so little, as i call them, “Wanna-be-Noobs” are basically a peice of dust in my life.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@ONTOPIC</span> - Yea the sword isnt bad at all, i dont much like the color though.</p>
