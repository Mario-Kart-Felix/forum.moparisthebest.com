I think this is a good rule, it probably even falls under griefing.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tom">@Tom</a>, I don’t think people are saying others should be banned for this, at least not without a fair warning beforehand.<br>

<p>Basically this.</p>
<p>As said in my original post, I agree it may come under griefing anyhow.</p>

<p>Only one with an issue is Agl, he’s starting his: “When I was a mod…” again, he’s already lost the argument so is now just moaning about it. His argument is reports already take long enough, despite the fact most of them are solved within 5 seconds.</p>
<p>I don’t think he understands the topic at all.</p>

But I want it added to the list because imo it should be stated as against the rules.</p>

<p>But by the time it’s came to this level there should be no uncertainty because there has been dialogue. Obviously if they’ve logged on, locked a chest and left we can’t really do much apart from remove it/wait for it to expire.</p>

<p>Be considerate to peoples situations, this is a community server, not a government ran country. Don’t place blocks here! Don’t build your house here! Don’t leave the gate open! Let’s get a few things straight about this chest idea:</p>
<p>I could understand adding this if the person did it to blatantly annoy another for example leaving 15 chest locks around the exit(s).

That would more come under griefing anyhow.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if someone leaves a chest there for a reasonable reason then they should be told to sort it out by communicating, what I’m saying is that the staff team seem obsessed with sticking their noses in every situation on the server and it’s creating more problems than solutions. Instead of the server looking to us for every little thing that is a problem in their Minecraft lives we should instead encourage these disputes to be sorted between members without dragging us into it.</p>
<p>The issue with adding all these rules is that people seem to think if somebody ever does it in the slightest, they don’t even need to ask them to remove it, they just report them and move on with their day. This is a community server, we’re not a government police force. We’re hear to make sure everyone gets along, to maintain the server, and to keep things functioning correctly.</p>
<p>The only dick move here would be reporting somebody for locking a chest on your property because they’re new, or have expensive items in, or enchantments when they’re going offline. What I’m saying is this rule hits the wrong people, you’re shooting at something that already has a rule to stop it and you’re hitting innocent people who aren’t griefers while doing it, why?[/quote]I’m not fully sure what is in the chest but someone apparently locked some of Tarkoff’s chest which shouldn’t be allowed.</p>
