    <description>Can jagex ban you for making a private server, if so how do they find out? and is my chances high of getting banned?

ive got my source from pimpscape, Every once in awhile he(the owner of the sourcE) logs on and dominates, how can i be as powerful as him and how can i take his powers away, It sometimes annoys me how he banns some of my users.

Why do people creat more than one network on hamichi?

How do i port forward, Links are helpful

how do i add Commands, Such as ::rares ::starterkit ect... I tryed the tuts, And none of them worked.

All help is appreated.</description>

<p>1st people create more than one ham network cus they can only accept a certain number of people</p>
<p>2ndi think u go on server.java and look for ure defult port which is 43594 change both too what ever port u want</p>
<p>3rd go on client.java ctrl f tools copy it and paste it below and make sure it starts and ends with { or } change the name of the command and change the item id codes and if how many u want.</p>

              <p>If the owner’s username is Pimp, then go into the file, and instead of deleting it, open it and where there is a string of numbers next to the password, change those to anything. He will never log onto that account again.<br>
Do this to whatever the account is if that isn’t the account.</p>
<p>Next, go into client.java in notepad, and replace the word Pimp with your own username.<br>
Also, go into the data folder, and open up the administrators.txt file, deleting his username if it’s still there.<br>
Check the staff.txt file and do the same if his character name is there. This should fix the problem.<br>
Finally, check the ip he came on with, and add it to the IP bans.</p>
<p>Case closed, and the original owner just to disciplined/played. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
