    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-build-a-pc/533591</link>
    <description>i have around 400-500 usd for building a new pc, since my last desktop broke and i dont really enjoy using a laptop at home, i dont need a monitor, neither a mouse or a keyboard, just the pc itself.

Also where can i buy a good mountain bike?
I&#39;m thinking about starting on bike trials..</description>
