    <description>[size=12pt][b]Hey guys, :D[/b][/size]
[i]Im looking for a server that has either just started or is already running well. I have a passion for helping out on servers without getting rewards hoping to earn a staff spot (mod/admin), but im sick of spending months on different servers without being recognised by staff.[/i]

[b]Things I could do for your server:[/b]
[i]-Well I have knowledge of coding so I can always help when you want a little.
-I would be active on forums both during when i&#39;m online (on my laptop), and always while im out by popping on every so often on my iPad/phone. Including: Writing about Updates, Answering questions, removing spam, adding little competitions, Guides (skill, money making for beginners, price guides, etc..) etc..
-I would go to all rsps sites and advertise your server, doing/re-doing the advertisement posts to the best possible (most appealing) way I can that will stand out to the rest.
-Play at a minimum of 3hours a day.. (but can be a lot more, as of yesterday i did spend just over 12 hours on a server)
-always giving you ideas that can help improve the eco and the gameplay.
-always help the new-comers
-being active on Youtube with advertisments, pk videos, tutorials + lots more
-I have got adobe CS5 and I able to use: Dreamweaver, photoshop and illustrator to a good standard.
+more, just ask and i could tell you if i can do it or not ;D[/i]

[b]Peace dudes- Much love,
[i]Lee[/i][/b]
