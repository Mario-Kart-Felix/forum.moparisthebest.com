        <ol>
<li>
<p>Before we start with all of the questions, why don’t you tell us a bit about yourself.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">That would take the fun away from being a mopar legend.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From what we understand, you originally moved to China in order to be an English tutor. What is it like being an educator, and has it lived up to what you thought it would’ve been?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">I do work in china, Shenzhen to be specific at a english teaching school. It’s a very cool job although I do not teach much anymore as I have taken over more of the back end of it.  I sort of fell into the position when my cousin requested me to help with the school after he had purchased it and then decided to move back to the united states with his wife.  So far its been fun but I doubt I would stay here forever.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have any future plans for the Silab client, or is it over for good?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">I had never envisioned the initial popularity of the silab client and really didn’t take care of it or the source for that matter so I doubt I would ever want to go through the trouble of writing it again, for those that are interested its a relatively simple setup all I did was take a higher revision client item definition loading and model loading and slapped it into the 317, this involves adding some extra variables and the method reading both model headers but nothing beyond that.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any projects you’re working on now?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Not really, motivation has always been a problem for me.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was your inspiration for creating the Silab client? Was there any sort of motivation in particular?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">The Silabclient was just an idea I had some may remember that prior to more advanced sources coming out people really didn’t bother with using a 508 server or beyond myself included I had already previously added custom models to the 317 cache (the halo energy sword to be exact) as well as added custom item definitions (black phat). I then proceeded to try to import the dark bow into a 317 cache. After I had successfully released the dark bow client people started requesting more and more items. again my laziness got the better of me and I just wrote a quick app to import all the items and item models of the current revision and released it as the silabclient.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was it like hosting the most popular web client, and what made you stop?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">At first it was expensive originally I didn’t have advertising on the site I simply moved the silabclient to my own website because mopar forums had been flooded with nothing but silab questions. I was banned from my first host within 48 hours due to the amount of traffic i was pulling on the shared hosting plan. I then moved to a dedicated server which was costing me around $175 a month. After adding Google Adsense and tribal fusion it was atleast profitable but more work than I really wanted to deal with. As for what made me give it up Jagex was pressing me about removing it and at the time Ruler Eric was getting sued for IBot. Sometimes being an adult sucks I decided it was safer just to remove the webclient.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What originally sparked your interest in programming? What was the first language you tackled?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Aryan was the reason I started to do programming I wanted a herb fetching bot.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aside from Java, what languages do you feel you are talented in, and what are your capabilities?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">I don’t really feel talented in any language English included. Everything I have learned is self taught and not always from the best sources.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you believe is the reason behind what many members feel is a lack of advancement in the RSPS community, and do you have any possible solutions?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">I think the reason RSPS servers are dying is because Runescape is dying. Maybe if the Runescape community recovers the RSPS communities will also start to recover. Another opinion of mine would be a lack of community driven projects. However myself included have tried and failed to start one of these over the years I guess its just the curse of Moparscape.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who from the forums do you think has a particular talent when it comes to programming? Why?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">newbiehacker - although hes a lazy love over the years he has produced some interesting sources that I have always enjoyed to play with</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any promising developments you’ve noticed over the last year?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">the updated cache grabber was a pretty nice addition to the forums I don’t know if its still being maintained but someone should totally make a cache repository with it.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Were there any personal qualities or leadership abilities that you encountered and picked up while you were a staff member?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Depends which time, if you mean the first time I was staff prior to me being banned from the forums. No I was horrible because I was a report Nazi. After I was allowed to return to the boards and become a mod again I took a much more laid back approach and didn’t really let myself get worked up about it. If I had any advice for current mods I would just say remember its a volunteer position.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did you find Mopar, and what was it like at the time compared to now?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">I found Mopar after Kaitnieks closed. It’s basically the same old faces have disappeared some return some don’t but nothing gets done anyway so it does not matter =D</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you had to choose a song to describe the current inhabitants of the MoparScape forums, what would you choose?<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Interesting Question I guess I’d go with “Hallowed be thy name - Iron Maiden” because according to some the forums have been on death row for years.</span></p>
