    <title>Dead Space 3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dead-space-3/526743</link>
    <description>This has been bothering more than it should, but I am very curious of one thing that occurred in this game; how did Isaac go into space without his helmet on? If you noticed, whenever the ship was destroyed by mines, and Isaac was trying to find an EVA suit, his helmet was sucked out through a hole in the wall, which was nothing but space on the other side. The crazy man Isaac is, he decided to chase his helmet through the whole and out into space, luckily grabbing the helmet and putting it on. Even though he retrieved his helmet pretty quickly, I don&#39;t understand how he did implode, due to space being a vacuum. I know this question is probably being taken too far and too seriously, but I would just like some coverage on this if anyone knows any technical answer to how he did not die from going into a vacuum without a helmet on.</description>

<p>I figured I would just bump this thread rather than making a completely new one, but I was wondering if anyone actually has this game and would be willing to start over from the beginning and play the co-op with me. I thought this was a really fun game, and I’ve always enjoyed playing games like this with another person, which is why I think the experience will be so much different while playing with a partner.</p>

<p>I bought it and never even downloaded it, I don’t have much free time on the computer these days but if we were to be on at the same time I’m sure we could play through it. I’m online Monday to Friday 9am-4pm GMT usually, not sure if you’d be awake at those times.</p>
