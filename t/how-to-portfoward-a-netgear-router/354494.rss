Step 5: Go To &quot;Firewall Rules&quot;, and where it says &quot;Outbound Services&quot;, press Add.

Step 6. For &quot;Service&quot;, choose your RSPS one, and change &quot;Action&quot;, to Allow Always. Then for &quot;Log&quot;, just change it to &quot;Never&quot;, for less lag. Then press &quot;Apply&quot;.

Step 8: Find out your COMPUTER I.P., by going to Start, Run, cmd. Then type &quot;ipconfig&quot;, without &quot;&quot;. Write down the number next to &quot;I.P. Address&quot;.

Step 9. Go back to the internet, and for &quot;Service&quot;, choose the RSPS one, for Action, Allow Always. Then for &quot;Send To LAN Server&quot;, type in your I.P. Then for &quot;WAN Users&quot;, leave it to Any. Then for &quot;Log&quot;, do &quot;never&quot;, for less lag. Then, press Apply
