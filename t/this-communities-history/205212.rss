    <description>Thought people might wanna know since i have been around, very early and i can hardly see anyone around now that were around back then.


(I dont know the dates) Long long ago if i can remember well Miss silabsoft had the first multiplayer rsc server. It was complete basic and had no objects or npc&#39;s just chat and each others sprites. Then another community came, i cant even remember the name of this community anymore but it was lead by a person called Josh and developers were RLN, BobDole81 and i think eXemplar (my thoughts could be wrong) anyway there was quite alot of hype back then and pictures of Teleports working and basic objects spawned. Then something happend (aparently Josh took the donation money and ran) if i can remember correctly, then BobDole81 kept working on that project by him self called &quot;Geminus&quot; and he managed to get a fight system happening and some other small things (big things at the time) This was a time where there was no people who advertised servers, everybody who was around either wanted to learn or waited patiently for rsc to get developed.

Then Reines popped up with a basic server (similer to what BobDole81 had created) (Sean, eXemplar, stork and maby more) created rscd base which he used. That progressed quite fast but was private and i dont think Reines really thought about full on developing that into a real game for awhile.

Around that time BobDole81 let Protosstribe(ephemeral) help develop it, sw0o0sh offerd to host it and then that was the very start of it all. People started playing and Protosstribe threw in some more updates here and there, and privately on the side Bakatool had a C# server with probably more Progress than anyone at the time had (but it had alot of bugs) so Protosstribe and Bakatool and I teamed up with them to take Geminus further, it got further and then thats around the time RSCD sneaked in front (invite only) and had more features to offer. Ezpk.org (where Geminus was being hosted/developed) had around 3000 users signed up on forums with a nice forum skin (same one as RuneScape) by sw0o0sh. Then RSCD was getting all the attention and Reines was too good, Geminus team slowly fell apart then got released, RSCD stayed strong for a long time and got developed a lot. Reines accidently put RSCD v4? i think it was, source on Reinet and some people got it. RSCD hit about 300 users and had a great community and was ran by great staff.

then Storkpk popped up, stork deciding to download the rscd base source and dev it, people knew about it but didnt think much of it when it was in its early stages. I remember slowly hearing about it more and more while playing rscd so one day i decided to take a look and it had about 300 people online, and reached around 500 (got bigger than rscd) using a different approach (Points + Pk only server) it became popular fast. 

Jagex then came along and shut down both servers.

PR4Y attempted to host RSCD agian which Jamie (Reines) gave to him to host and try bring it back. The game didnt even get online i dont think then Demonik came along (v3n1 leading it. with Alex(Alecks) and punKrockeR developing) That was based off RSCD v4 reines accidently let out i belive and they hosted it until v3n1 got taken to court etc. Alex released Demonik to mopar and that was the 2nd decent open source project out standing next to Geminus, People decided to use Demonik and make servers, like Divine Pk, EdgePkz and a bunch of other stuff. and now we are up to close to here.

Oh with RSCD v25 leaked by PR4Y and released by a heep of others. This is where we currently are.


[b]This is just to people who have wanted to know whats happend, some of my info might be wrong so correct me. Dont ask why wasnt ur server up there (if its a server within the last 2 months) because chances are its not really a jump from anything thats around now or everyone knows about it.[/b]</description>

You say anyone with a Brain would fix those… But you couldn’t, and you didn’t… So you don’t have a brain?</p>
<p>Luke, you make yourself look like a fucking retard on these forums…</p>

Not really, anyone could take RSCD and modify it but it doesn’t mean that it’s any further ahead in development than what they started with.

              <p>I noticed someone was saying jagex was trying to sell the<br>
rsc source the whole time? &lt;----I love this Topic so let me sum it all up <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>rs2=Fail</p>
<p>“Runescape” or commonly know to u guys as “runescape classic (rsc)”<br>
is never going to be sold by jagex because of one main reason…<br>
Rs2 would be completely killed if rsc was released to the public.<br>
Even many of the people on rs2 want to play rsc still.<br>
Plus Andrew will never give the source out. You know how if u were a rocker<br>
and u have ur first guitar ever? Then as ur career goes on u give out guitars<br>
and shit… but u will never give out ur first guitar? Andrew gower wont give up<br>
his first guitar…However he will give up others…such as rs2. Thats why<br>
hes resigning as Head of Runescape and moving on.</p>
<p>Jagex has been offered ALOT of money for the rsc source…<br>
I believe a Bid for it got up to 2.5 million but why sell it for that low?<br>
If hes going to give up the source he should just give up rs2.</p>
<p>Theres ALOT more to say but im not going to go on.<br>
Hope u get the point</p>
<p>anyways<br>
Thx for the history of this community…<br>
even tho i havent been here for long…<br>
I do remember most of it.<br>

              <p>[quote=“Big Bertha, post:78, topic:205212”]Gonna expand on yours a little bit xEnt, with the stuff I know.</p>
<p>eFak-<br>
Josh made eFak, with a couple of developers sometime in 2006.  Pyru, Josh and BobDole I believe were the administrators.  3rxnet, led by Ben [OMFG] merged with eFak eventually.  Hopes were very positive about a private server coming up.  Josh eventually fagged out and left with the donations. eFak’s irc was extremely active throughout.  Regex, eXemplar, Josh, Tm218, Stork, Sean, Sensored3, sppt, a lot of big names on IRC wasn’t uncommon.</p>
<p>RSCD -<br>
Reines RSCdaemon attempt, obviously.  Hugely popular, and was at first invite only.  It started out as an April Fool’s prank by Reines, but I think he decided he’d take the idea and run with it.  RSCD, like I said, was largely popular, especially with people from Reines’ communities SYI and Reinet.  RSCd eventually got closed after an email to Reines I believe.</p>
<p>StorkPK -<br>
I thought servers were done, and then Stork released StorkPK, which as you said was based on points.  It at first was run on a MyPunBB forum and a server Stork had at his house.  Tewl then decided it would be cool to DDoS the shit out of Stork’s server, so he decided to move it to a dedi.  StorkPK went pretty well for a while, was a decent rival for RSCD.  T_X/Gore found occasional glitches in StorkPK, though Stork eventually found them.  StorkPK started to decline greatly, I believe Stork was busy with university, and the community fell apart.  Mod spots were given out [I was pretty guilty for this, afraid to say], more bots were made [Imk0tter had a good run with one] and then finally, the mass teleport to the wilderness, killing innocent people done by Skyline and Curtis.  Server pretty much fell apart from there.  Stork eventually shut it down after an email from Jagex I believe.  His panel was written in JSP and the forum was based on PunBB.</p>
<p>Demonik -<br>
Demonik was coded by Alex and punKrockeR, funded by Jay [v3n1], server maintenance was operated by Jinn and I did occasional grunt work Alex didn’t feel like doing website wise.  Demonik ran pretty well, was the biggest around at its time.  It consisted of one dedi, but it ran two private servers, one P2P and on F2P.  F2P was all wilderness except for towns and banks I believe [hard to believe I forgot all of this already]. I believe we had 100 users each atleast on both servers.  This was around the time PR4Y decided he was going to ressurect RSCD.  It failed I guess, and Jameson convinced him to meet him at a mall to sell the RSCD source.  Jay and PR4Y met up.  PR4Y had the source on a USB stick, and Jay had money in an envelope.  Well Jay put all ones in the envelope, which PR4Y didn’t know [I don’t remember the price PR4Y wanted, but he didn’t get that many ones, thats for damn sure.]  So Jay then had the RSCD source, which was used a little for updates.  Demonik was going good, and then our dedi host shut the website down with a DMCA notice as the index.  Jameson then got in legal problems with Jagex, and subsequently went to court for it.</p>
<p>Source info -<br>
RSCD v4, released to a few people, Alex was one of these people.<br>
RSCD v25, released by PR4Y after Jameson scammed him, then released by Jameson.<br>
Demonik v2, released accidentally by Alex in a client release.<br>
Demonik Final, released by Alex after Demonik fell through.<br>
StorkPK, sold by Stork.</p>
<p>That’s all I remember for now, might edit with more info later.[/quote]<br>
StorkPK was never sold by stork, and nobody even has it except stork still.<br>
RSCDv4 was left on Reines website accidentally, and a few people managed to grab it IIRC.</p>
<p>Yeh i left the efak and other stuff out, mainly because i didn’t know the exact details apart from josh running with the money lol.</p>

But i didn’t wanna include that as i didn’t know 100% sure all the details.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok, it was his glass dagger and my henry’s classic server.  We were going to team up and share our progress with each other is what it was.<br>
I didn’t scam him? I believe he sent me his server and I was trying to get mine to send to him but he wasnt able to accept it in the MSN chat. I then had to get off for the day and get some dinner and whatever.  I sign on the next day to try again and he released his source. I legit, wanted to team up with him.  I didnt want us to release anything that early on.  I thought we should have waited until we were farther along.<br>
Basically we both had some features the other hadn’t and we were planning on sharing.</p>

              <p>Gonna expand on yours a little bit xEnt, with the stuff I know.</p>
<p>eFak-<br>
Josh made eFak, with a couple of developers sometime in 2006.  Pyru, Josh and BobDole I believe were the administrators.  3rxnet, led by Ben [OMFG] merged with eFak eventually.  Hopes were very positive about a private server coming up.  Josh eventually fagged out and left with the donations. eFak’s irc was extremely active throughout.  Regex, eXemplar, Josh, Tm218, Stork, Sean, Sensored3, sppt, a lot of big names on IRC wasn’t uncommon.</p>
<p>RSCD -<br>
Reines RSCdaemon attempt, obviously.  Hugely popular, and was at first invite only.  It started out as an April Fool’s prank by Reines, but I think he decided he’d take the idea and run with it.  RSCD, like I said, was largely popular, especially with people from Reines’ communities SYI and Reinet.  RSCd eventually got closed after an email to Reines I believe.</p>
<p>StorkPK -<br>
I thought servers were done, and then Stork released StorkPK, which as you said was based on points.  It at first was run on a MyPunBB forum and a server Stork had at his house.  Tewl then decided it would be cool to DDoS the shit out of Stork’s server, so he decided to move it to a dedi.  StorkPK went pretty well for a while, was a decent rival for RSCD.  T_X/Gore found occasional glitches in StorkPK, though Stork eventually found them.  StorkPK started to decline greatly, I believe Stork was busy with university, and the community fell apart.  Mod spots were given out [I was pretty guilty for this, afraid to say], more bots were made [Imk0tter had a good run with one] and then finally, the mass teleport to the wilderness, killing innocent people done by Skyline and Curtis.  Server pretty much fell apart from there.  Stork eventually shut it down after an email from Jagex I believe.  His panel was written in JSP and the forum was based on PunBB.</p>
<p>Demonik -<br>
Demonik was coded by Alex and punKrockeR, funded by Jay [v3n1], server maintenance was operated by Jinn and I did occasional grunt work Alex didn’t feel like doing website wise.  Demonik ran pretty well, was the biggest around at its time.  It consisted of one dedi, but it ran two private servers, one P2P and on F2P.  F2P was all wilderness except for towns and banks I believe [hard to believe I forgot all of this already]. I believe we had 100 users each atleast on both servers.  This was around the time PR4Y decided he was going to ressurect RSCD.  It failed I guess, and Jameson convinced him to meet him at a mall to sell the RSCD source.  Jay and PR4Y met up.  PR4Y had the source on a USB stick, and Jay had money in an envelope.  Well Jay put all ones in the envelope, which PR4Y didn’t know [I don’t remember the price PR4Y wanted, but he didn’t get that many ones, thats for damn sure.]  So Jay then had the RSCD source, which was used a little for updates.  Demonik was going good, and then our dedi host shut the website down with a DMCA notice as the index.  Jameson then got in legal problems with Jagex, and subsequently went to court for it.</p>
<p>Source info -<br>
RSCD v4, released to a few people, Alex was one of these people.<br>
RSCD v25, released by PR4Y after Jameson scammed him, then released by Jameson.<br>
Demonik v2, released accidentally by Alex in a client release.<br>
Demonik Final, released by Alex after Demonik fell through.<br>
StorkPK, sold by Stork.</p>
<p>That’s all I remember for now, might edit with more info later.</p>
