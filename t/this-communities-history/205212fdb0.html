<p>there were people playing with the concept long before silab, it was just that the playing was private and limited. I first started messing with the concept pre sbot, me and richyt decided to go at it (during the sbot phase) but got nowhere (both too lazy and bit sharing was annoying and foreign concept, alot of my earlier work had involved changing how it was handled). I later played with this idea with varying degress of success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rscd came about because exemplar was into the idea, I had been wanting to do it for awhile (and had messed with it previously) so we joined up. The success (and developer interest) in aryan was a somewhat major factor of this. We started going and I assumed we would get others behind us. This wasnt the case, I ended up doing alot of grunt work (which we all know im not a fan of) and that started to spell the doom for it. I had agreed (to the plight of some of the others in the group) to host the server at efak (partially because I wanted a community to join, so that they would be the fall guys for any real litigation and try to keep myself out of it). I kept bugging josh for money, mediator and josh kept having fights (we moved <span class="hashtag">#aryan</span> over there for the rscd shit), and we found out josh was snooping on us via some mod in irc. So we left. The project later died during when I was doing a major rewrite and got sick of it. (There was some major things that I did to get it up and running to test the behaviour of some of the more obsecure interactions between the client and server, some of it was well thought out, other parts really werent, which is obvious to anyone whos done any real server development)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bobdoles server came around somewhere inbetween, exemplar was never a developer on it, tho bob did hang around our channel and was welcome there after we had determined his server wasnt a c+p ripoff (like narya by ownagesbot or wtvr).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What reines did with rscd was without any of our knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theres a new project with only me and exemplar in it, started from scratch (but reused some rscd code later, with modifications in areas (alot haha)) also called rscd. Please do not get confused, why we didnt mind releasing the source we did want to keep the name for ourself. It is a pro name (even if somewhat obvious). This project will probably be open sourced eventually. (I am currently in the processing of prepraring to write our scripting language, which will be compiled directly to java)</p>

        <p>The major things that still prevent this community from progressing further in my opinion is lack of organization and the lack of interest in things never before.</p>
<p>No disrespect to you Sean or any other developer, but the goal of obtaining a Runescape Classic in my opinion has been achieved.  That’s what you and exemplar and others have attempted and over the years it has progressed into a system that allows for a Runescape Classic Private Server.  But where do we go from here as a community?  I think there’s a huge gap between the few who are actually still developing private servers and the ones who play/operate at a basic level.  Of course you can always rewrite a source and make it better.  I, myself, am quite interested in seeing what you and exemplar cook up, but I challenge this community to start thinking outside the box here.  You’ve got a game platform - regardless of it being Runescape Classic - be creative and make something thats going to catch everyones attention.</p>

        <p>oh its certainly been done and its nothing new, we are merely doing it because we enjoy and it gives us a project to massage our egos with. Writing any form of game server encompasses ALOT of different technical abilities, so it gives me somewhere I can sink my teeth into.</p>
<p>I had tried to talk exemplar into making a game with me, but both of us are client/graphics nubs and felt it was way too much for two people.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Sean, post:65, topic:205212”]oh its certainly been done and its nothing new, we are merely doing it because we enjoy and it gives us a project to massage our egos with. Writing any form of game server encompasses ALOT of different technical abilities, so it gives me somewhere I can sink my teeth into.</p>
<p>I had tried to talk exemplar into making a game with me, but both of us are client/graphics nubs and felt it was way too much for two people.[/quote]<br>

        <p>Sounds like you left out a few details.  Even entirely excluding me :’( lmao.  Whatever.</p>
<p>Anyways, you got a bunch of your timings mixed up.  And yea it was either frank_ or alecks that had the first server not silab. Silab’s server was based off of an early version of RSCD. (I have a copy of hers from a while back, it wasnt her furthest server, that one got lost in a crash terribly enough).  But yea, a lot of your timings are a bit whacked lol.  I thought you were here for most of that? Maybe you came a little after and pieced together what you heard ;).</p>

        <p>Gonna expand on yours a little bit xEnt, with the stuff I know.</p>
<p>eFak-<br>
Josh made eFak, with a couple of developers sometime in 2006.  Pyru, Josh and BobDole I believe were the administrators.  3rxnet, led by Ben [OMFG] merged with eFak eventually.  Hopes were very positive about a private server coming up.  Josh eventually fagged out and left with the donations. eFak’s irc was extremely active throughout.  Regex, eXemplar, Josh, Tm218, Stork, Sean, Sensored3, sppt, a lot of big names on IRC wasn’t uncommon.</p>
<p>RSCD -<br>
Reines RSCdaemon attempt, obviously.  Hugely popular, and was at first invite only.  It started out as an April Fool’s prank by Reines, but I think he decided he’d take the idea and run with it.  RSCD, like I said, was largely popular, especially with people from Reines’ communities SYI and Reinet.  RSCd eventually got closed after an email to Reines I believe.</p>
<p>StorkPK -<br>
I thought servers were done, and then Stork released StorkPK, which as you said was based on points.  It at first was run on a MyPunBB forum and a server Stork had at his house.  Tewl then decided it would be cool to DDoS the shit out of Stork’s server, so he decided to move it to a dedi.  StorkPK went pretty well for a while, was a decent rival for RSCD.  T_X/Gore found occasional glitches in StorkPK, though Stork eventually found them.  StorkPK started to decline greatly, I believe Stork was busy with university, and the community fell apart.  Mod spots were given out [I was pretty guilty for this, afraid to say], more bots were made [Imk0tter had a good run with one] and then finally, the mass teleport to the wilderness, killing innocent people done by Skyline and Curtis.  Server pretty much fell apart from there.  Stork eventually shut it down after an email from Jagex I believe.  His panel was written in JSP and the forum was based on PunBB.</p>
<p>Demonik -<br>
Demonik was coded by Alex and punKrockeR, funded by Jay [v3n1], server maintenance was operated by Jinn and I did occasional grunt work Alex didn’t feel like doing website wise.  Demonik ran pretty well, was the biggest around at its time.  It consisted of one dedi, but it ran two private servers, one P2P and on F2P.  F2P was all wilderness except for towns and banks I believe [hard to believe I forgot all of this already]. I believe we had 100 users each atleast on both servers.  This was around the time PR4Y decided he was going to ressurect RSCD.  It failed I guess, and Jameson convinced him to meet him at a mall to sell the RSCD source.  Jay and PR4Y met up.  PR4Y had the source on a USB stick, and Jay had money in an envelope.  Well Jay put all ones in the envelope, which PR4Y didn’t know [I don’t remember the price PR4Y wanted, but he didn’t get that many ones, thats for damn sure.]  So Jay then had the RSCD source, which was used a little for updates.  Demonik was going good, and then our dedi host shut the website down with a DMCA notice as the index.  Jameson then got in legal problems with Jagex, and subsequently went to court for it.</p>
<p>Source info -<br>
RSCD v4, released to a few people, Alex was one of these people.<br>
RSCD v25, released by PR4Y after Jameson scammed him, then released by Jameson.<br>
Demonik v2, released accidentally by Alex in a client release.<br>
Demonik Final, released by Alex after Demonik fell through.<br>
StorkPK, sold by Stork.</p>
<p>That’s all I remember for now, might edit with more info later.</p>

<p>^ Just memory arrangement, i didn’t remember perfectly, but what i did remember is your part of it. I mean i didnt know perfectly 100% but what i do remember was you talked Protosstribe(ephemeral) into teaming up to make freescape/glowing dagger, then scammed him. But i didn’t wanna include that as i didn’t know 100% sure all the details.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok, it was his glass dagger and my henry’s classic server.  We were going to team up and share our progress with each other is what it was.<br>
I didn’t scam him? I believe he sent me his server and I was trying to get mine to send to him but he wasnt able to accept it in the MSN chat. I then had to get off for the day and get some dinner and whatever.  I sign on the next day to try again and he released his source. I legit, wanted to team up with him.  I didnt want us to release anything that early on.  I thought we should have waited until we were farther along.<br>
Basically we both had some features the other hadn’t and we were planning on sharing.</p>
