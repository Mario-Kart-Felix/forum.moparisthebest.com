    <title>Surrogates</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/surrogates/305858</link>
    <description>It was yet another Friday, and my brother just randomly asked if I wanted to go to a movie. Nothing unusual, as we do this from time to time. So we were looking through what movies were playing, and we saw Bruce Willis&#39; name come up. Surrogates was it.

Whether or not you saw previews for this movie, I&#39;ll give you a brief synopsis. Imagine a world where we can control humanistic robots using our minds. We go into a sort of &quot;trance&quot; in order to control a robot from a remote location. This robot looks just like a normal person, but the way [i]we[/i] want a person to look like. Having a surrogate means you can represent yourself as a person that you want to be, instead of as yourself.

Due to being able to express yourself exactly how you want to be, the entire world goes into a peaceful bliss. Crime drops to an almost nonexistent amount, people are much safer, and everyone is happy, or so it seems. Life is great, until a homicide occurs. It&#39;s been so long since a murder has happened that they barely remember the last one. And here comes Bruce Willis, the hopeful saving cop that we can all count on from movie to movie. I won&#39;t go into detail here, but this is an action thriller that has some pretty cool and unexpected twists.

And like any major change to our society, there&#39;s the opposing group, the &quot;dreads&quot;. These are people who refuse to &quot;hook up to one of those machines&quot; and live life as an exile. They do their part well, even to the extent of killing surrogates to prove their point. They live on reservations to be shunned away from society.

In my opinion, surrogates are somewhat like the Internet made real. You have a way anonymously live real life through the existence of a machine. The only incomparable side here is that, when using a surrogate, you are expressing who you want to be, rather than who you are.

Now, here is the question I have for you: would you use a surrogate? Would you sit at home subconsciously controlling a humanistic robot many miles away? Would you choose a life where you can do all those adventures you wouldn&#39;t be able to physically do yourself, but from the safety of your home?

I wouldn&#39;t push it past humanity to actually do something like this :P, but it brings an interesting concept forward. If something like this would happen in my lifetime, I would certainly choose to become a dread. I might use the surrogates a little in the beginning, but I don&#39;t want to [i]be[/i] one. I want to live life as me, not as someone else. Plus, if I have to live every day to fend for myself without the world society there to help me, I think life might be a little more enjoying in an exiled community. :)</description>

<p>I guess I’d at least try a surrogate. As I haven’t seen the movie yet, I’m not sure how this idea exactly works. Is a surrogate a complete replacement of your body? Everything your surrogate feels, you feel too? If that’s so, then I see no reason why I would become a dread. People always talk about your interior ‘appearance’, so this actually allows you to present yourself the way you feel.</p>

<p>It’s basically to replace yourself. It started off as a military thing, but then the US government allowed civilians to use it. Eventually the entire world used them expect the dreads. Some people own multiple surrogates, but it’s not ideal afaik.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting and freaky idea imo. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
