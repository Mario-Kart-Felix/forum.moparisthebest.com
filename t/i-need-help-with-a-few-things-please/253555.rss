    <description>Hello moparscape, i just need some help with the following things.



1. How do i change a wild area to safe zone?

I wan&#39;t to know how to do this because i had made a staff zone at the graveyard event area and we keep attacking eachother...

2. How do i change the area of when a person dies what coordinates they end up in?

I went in player.java and changed the starting area but i can&#39;t change where you end up when you die, help please :D


I need a few more things answered but they can wait, i&#39;m more concerned about these things thanks.</description>

<li>Edit your nonWild method.</li>
<li>Find out what the coordinates are, find them and change them…<br>
Common sense.</li>
