    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-freezes-when-i-click-skillcape-shop-pi-fix-tutorial/434977</link>
    <description>Ok. Every week i see people posting this enquiry in the &#39;server help&#39; section, and every week i reply with the same answer. Now, what i can&#39;t seem to figure out is that there is most likely 100&#39;s of tutorials on this topic all around mopar? so why you have to result to the server help section other then the search bar? god knows... Now that&#39;s out of the way let&#39;s begin on this tutorial.

[center][b]Files we will be editing: ShopAssistant.Java
Difficulty:  1/10
Requirements: Basic common sense[/b][/center]

First things first. This error occurs because your server is plain and simply poorly and lazily coded. Someone has decided to add another skill but couldn&#39;t be bothered to modify the Skillcape shop.
[b]Step 1:[/b]
Load up a character, this can be any character it doesn&#39;t matter in the slightest. If you need help on doing this (unlikely) then it is accessible via: [i][b]Source&gt;Data&gt;Characters[/b][/i]
Once in this section; Open any character you desire, scroll down until you see something along the lines of &#39;Character-Skill&#39;. Here&#39;s a picture:
 [center][IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/zyabty.jpg[/img][/center]

[b]Step 2:[/b]
Note: your server may or may not have 24 skills, it may have 23, either way we&#39;re going presume you have 24 skills as you can&#39;t get an error for having more. (Trust one of you guys to find an error...)
With the amount of skills your server has in mind. Go back to the main of your source and go to: [i][b]src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;shops&gt;shopAssistant.Java[/b][/i]

[center][i][b]Should look like this:[/b][/i]

 [IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/mtsgfd.jpg[/img][/center]

[b]Step 3 (The Hardest Part):[/b]
Whilst in [i]&#39;shopAssistant.Java&#39;[/i] press [b]CTRL + F[/b] and search for:[code]public void openSkillCape()[/code]
Look for something along the lines of: [code] public int[] skillCapes = {9747,9753,9750,9768,9756,9759,9762,9801,9807,9783,9798,9804,9780,9795,9792,9774,9771,9777,9786,9810,9765,9948,12169}; [/code]
Replace that with:  [code] public int[] skillCapes = {9747,9753,9750,9768,9756,9759,9762,9801,9807,9783,9798,9804,9780,9795,9792,9774,9771,9777,9786,9810,9765,9948,12169,18508};[/code]
Doing this you add the ItemId for the skillcapes for the shop. Which will  add + 1 to make it trimmed and when purchased it will add the hood also.

Next, search for: [code]for (int i = 0; [/code]
Then replace that with the number of skills you have in your character files. For example, i have 24, so i  would replace it with: [code]for (int i = 0; i &lt; 24; i++) { [/code]

[b]Step 4 (The End):[/b]
Save it, compile and run your server! :)
