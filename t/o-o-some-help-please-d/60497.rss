    <description>Eheh, hello everyone. ;D

I have just started playing this server, and I have a couple of questions and some help I require. T_T

Isn&#39;t the ip 127.0.0.1?

xD

And if it is, I keep getting disconnected from it whenever I try to click or move or anything...

Then it keeps saying that I can&#39;t connect because my account is already logged in. -_-;

Can anyone help me with this problem please? :D

Oh, and uhh.... What else was I going to say. &gt;___&gt;;

OH!  And if anyone wants to add me, umm.... My name is...  Let me go check. O__O

Well, I didn&#39;t exactly follow the Hamatchi thingy...  Because when I pressed the .jar file in the MoparScape folder, it let me play...  Please tell me if I got the right IP LOL. xD

OH ok my name is Hakre, aduhh. xD

^^;

I didn&#39;t see anyone else online, so I was just wondering where everyone went...  Haha.[x

Are you all PKing or something? O_O;

Anyway, I would appreciate your help very much, and sorry I kind of typed what I thought, kind of sleepy at the moment. :D

OH one more thing!  The music player and the RS thingy lags when I press some of the item ID&#39;s and Object ID&#39;s and stuff and yeah. =x

Well I was just wondering if that is supposed to happen or not, because even when I do press one of them they do not pop up. T___T

Haha ok well thanks again in advance for the help I&#39;m sure to get. ;D


AHHHH!

Now when I try to log in with my original account, it doesn&#39;t have all my items I ::pickuped!  LOL.D:

EEK, I entered the same information as the account I created, what could be the problem?!  /Scared.D:

Oh well at least I do not have that disconnecting error anymore, but still I do kind of want my character back. ~_~</description>
