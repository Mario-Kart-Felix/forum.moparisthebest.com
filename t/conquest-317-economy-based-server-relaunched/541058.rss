[SPOILER=Getting Started]
Getting Started in Conquest-317 is very easy, simply log-in and select the &#39;Training Teleport&#39; here you will be able to train on Object(s) to get your Attack, Strength, Magic, Defence, HP, Prayer, and Range.


[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/home1.png[/img]

We chose Neitiznot as our Home as it provides a clean spacious environment. 

[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/home2.png[/img]

This shows most of the Server&#39;s shops, all good items have been basically taken out as they need to be acquired as drops. 

[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/home3.png[/img]

All NPC&#39;s that drop PVP armor drop the degraded armor which then needs to be fixed by the Monk at home.

[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/home4.png[/img]

Theiving for some Money Making however you do not make near as much as you used too.

[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/home5.png[/img]

Another shop at home that takes GP and rewards you with the Title of your choosing.

[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/home6.png[/img]

In Conquest you will come across 3 different keys (Crystal, Tower, and Golden) these can be used at this chest for rewards.

[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/train.png[/img]

Here is the Training Teleport it can be accessed using the your spell book, here you can get base stats for PVM and PVP quickly.
[/spoiler]

Once you have some base stats from the &#39;Training Teleport&#39; you&#39;ll probably want to direct your attention to one of our many custom Skills like Slayer or Summoning.

[SPOILER=Summoning]
Bosses Fightable in Summoning:

[ul][*]Dagannoth Supreme
[*]Dagannoth Rex
[*]Dagannoth Prime
[*]King Black Dragon
[*]Kalphite Queen
[*]Gen. Graandor
[*]K&#39;ril T (Zamorak GWD Boss)
[*]Commander Zilyana
[*]Kree&#39;ara
[*]Jad
[*]Nomad
[*]Sea Queen
[*]Tormented Demon
[*]Frost Dragon
[*]Corporeal Beast
[*]Balance-Elemental
[*]The Inadequacy 
[*]Avatar of Creation (requires 99 Slayer)

[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/summ1.png[/img]
[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/summ3.png[/img]


[b]Summoning is trained using the Summoning teleport (found in your spellbook) and then clicking your music tab and spawning your first Boss, once you kill the boss you will get his drops and XP towards Summoning. XP gets higher as you start fighting new and stronger Bosses.[/b][/spoiler]


[SPOILER=Slayer]

[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/slay1.png[/img]
[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/slay2.png[/img]

[b]Recently introduced was our Slayer system, this task based system assigns you many different RuneScape bosses, once killed you gain Slayer XP, the monster&#39;s drop, and Slayer Store Points (as shown above).[/b]
[/spoiler]

[SPOILER=Safe PKing and PVP]
We&#39;ve recently re-done most of the PVP and included some of the following:
Safe-PK added as some people were/are afraid of losing their items.
Revnants added as teleport, however this is wild here and you may lose your items (Revs drop PVP armour and PVP artifacts).

[SPOILER=Skilling]
[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/skill.png[/img]

[b]Most of our Skilling takes place below Varrock at the Champions&#39; Guild this is where you&#39;ll be able to access most skills[/b][/spoiler]

[SPOILER=Thieving &amp; Smithing]
[img]http://conquest-317.com/images/skill.png[/img]
