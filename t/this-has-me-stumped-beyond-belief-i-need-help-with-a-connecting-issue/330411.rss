    <title>This has me stumped beyond belief, I need help with a connecting issue?</title>

    <description>I&#39;m having trouble connecting to my own server, I set the gui.java serverip from localhost to &quot;despairscape.servegame.com&quot; and when I load up the client with no ip duc running in the background and the source running it says error connecting to server. When I go to Runelocus status checker it says my server is online and then when I go to see if I port forwarded correctly, apparently I did because I get this message from http://www.canyouseeme.org/

Success: I can see your service on *.*.*.23 on port (43594)
Your ISP is not blocking port 43594

What am I forgetting to do?</description>
