    <title>Custom food?</title>

    <description>How would I add my own custom food?

I made a slice of pie in Metaseqouia, I added a drop model and made the wield model (in the ints) -1 cause its not used, I changed the option to Eat and I still wield the pie and it shows nothing, what would I add in potions.java to make it work and not wield pie.</description>
