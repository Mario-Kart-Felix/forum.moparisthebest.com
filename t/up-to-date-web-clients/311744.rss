    <title>Up to date web clients</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/up-to-date-web-clients/311744</link>
    <description>Okay, after working extremly hard and researching a few minor edits I have finished a small secret project of mine, dispite being bored to hell and back due to recent events in my area: (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8335279.stm) I have finally shifted to create my little own webclient service that I doubt will get any use.

So yeah, gas mains have exploded, I was stuck in my town center intill 1:30am as trains where shut and I&#39;m freezing cold in my house as there is no heating yet.

Here&#39;s a little introduction of my work and what I have to offer to you.

[b]Introduction[/b]
[i]As of yet I have not listed all the Item, object and NPC Id&#39;s, although they contain every up to date model, anim and gfx. [/i]


[ul][li]Animations up to date.[/li]
[li]Graphics up to date.[/li]
[li]NPC&#39;s up to date.[/li]
[li]Objects up to date.[/li]
[li]Items up to date.[/li]
[li]Preloading models (Custom made, fixing bugs and glitches shortly)[/li]
[li]Renamed[/li][/ul]


I have added most of the features people are looking for these days, as I am not great at graphics I am still waiting for a experianced person to do so.

The project name also comes under my server development: iSoft.


This thread will be updated shortly, I am just trying to warm my fingers up.</description>
