    <title>Eye thing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/eye-thing/440042</link>
    <description>ok i was getting ready to go to sleep last night when i noticed my pillow would change colors depending which eye was open. to i looked at the pillow and kept switching which eye was looking at it with my hand. I noticed it a couple times b4 but i didnt think it was anything. I tried to take 2 pictures to try to show how each eye sees stuff so here it is.

sorry about how big the pictures are ill have to resize it on a different site. or i could resize it on my phone and reupload it. there is a little bit of a difference in each picture but it is slight. they probably arent that good of examples to show.

I believe it has more to do how each i perceives light. my right eye see white as white; while my left eye sees the same white object as more of a light gray. in the picture my my right eye views the pillow and bed sheets as darker shades of their respective colors while my left eye. im thinking about asking my eye doctor about it.

the images were produced with different exposures.
left eye:

              <p>Thanks for contacting Dr. David, local ophthalmologist for the Mopar sites. It seems your eyes could need a checkup, so if you could set up an appointment with my secretary sinisoul we can get that fixed ASAP. Thanks for your time.</p>

              <p>I think its not dependent on my eyes now. idk now b/c when i turned my head and compared my eyes again the result was switched. its more like dependent either which side the light source is on or something. the light sources are florescent if that matters.</p>
