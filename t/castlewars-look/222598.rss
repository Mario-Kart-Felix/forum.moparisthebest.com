    <description>Well i have castle wars and ive made it a fun zone and all

but atm its for mage only

it came with the source on mage only but ive made the actual castlewars and stuff

but how do i make it so it can be melee range and mage ?

thanks to who ever helps 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALSO: I have cw so when u go into sara portal u get teled to the waiting room.

how would i make it so it counts down from 5 mionutes then tele&#39;s you

Basically how do i make it like normal rs but instead of 20 min wait i make it 5 mins.

so every 5 mins a new game starts

thanks every 1 i will appreciate it alot</description>
