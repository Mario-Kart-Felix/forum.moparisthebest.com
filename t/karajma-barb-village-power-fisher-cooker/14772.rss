    <description>I am willing to pay rs2 cash for this script. Im not real picky about what it fishes or where, but i need it to either fish then cook, or fish and bank.

It will need to work well over long periods of time also

Email me at j5e1f9f1@gmail.com or add me to msn at j5e1f9f1@hotmail.com if you think you can make a good reliable script that fishes anywhere and then banks, or fishes and then cooks.
KARAJMA IS OF COURSE PREFERRED! i will pay extra for a working karajma script, but since i know it is very hard to bank from there i do not expect it.</description>
