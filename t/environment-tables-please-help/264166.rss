    <description>Hi everyone,

Well here my problem comes..

I&#39;ve always had a server, but since short I had to erase my harddrive cuz of viruses
Now I wanted to remake a server but I can&#39;t get it online
I portforwarded and all, I think my problem is with Environment Tables
I got the german version of XP does that mean Program files changes to Programme?
And if its so can someone please help me?
I&#39;m desperate because I did everything in my point..

Thanks,

~ Nypho</description>
