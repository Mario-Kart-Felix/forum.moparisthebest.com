    <title>[PI] MTP V2 Client and or cache? 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-mtp-v2-client-and-or-cache-317/555370</link>
    <description>After 3 years and a new comp, I&#39;m looking to get a client for my previous source used that marcbob created! It&#39;s called [b]MTP V2 Remake[/b]. I have the source, but do not have the normal client or the cache, only the webclient ready client w/o the cache. I can send that to anyone who wants it in return for the client for it (I believe it&#39;s called Fallen Pkers or Devotion Pk) - all the links I have checked on here are dead so, I&#39;d appreciate some help!

So I need:
-[b]Client that is for MTP V2 remake w same models[/b]
-[b]MTP V2 cache for the webclient ready client[/b]

If anyone could help me out, I&#39;d for sure appreciate it! 

Thanks all</description>
