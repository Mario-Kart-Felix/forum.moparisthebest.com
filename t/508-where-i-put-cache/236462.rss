    <title>508 Where i put cache?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-where-i-put-cache/236462</link>
    <description>Please do not try to help me if you have not been able to run a 508 server and client yourself.

Well this is what i did:
1.downloaded the 508 server, client, and cache then extracted into the C disk
2.renamed cache to &quot;508 Cache&quot;, it was originally &quot;rs2&quot;
3.Put the cache in the &quot;files&quot; folder of the client.
4.i pressed build.cmd in the client folder.
5.after compiled, i ran the 508 server.
6.Then i ran the 508 client by clicking on run.cmd in client folder
7.I get this error: 
[code]
Error: SignLink:233 SignLink: 372 Applet_sub1:338 client:2196 | java.lang.RuntimeException
[/code]

I have been told this is because i have misplaced the 508 cache but ive tried different tuts to get it working. I tryd putting the original 508 cache called &quot;rs2&quot; into a new folder called &quot;508 cache&quot; and just leaving that in C drive. I tried putting the C:508 Cache/rs2 into the &quot;files&quot; folder in client. Ive tried many things but i still get the same error.

If somebody could help it would be highly appreciated.</description>
