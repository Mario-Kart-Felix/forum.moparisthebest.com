<p>The founding fathers were not men of Christianity, they were men of the Enlightenment.</p>

</aside>
<p>They were all god fearing. They believe in a higher power but they went out of their way for the federal government to not interfere or show favoritism to any particular religion or church.</p>
<p>George Washington said “Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.” Morality cant be maintained without religion. Some considered Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin deists but that may have been because they believed religion to be personal. They didn’t make a deal out of it in public because they were public figures. They needed the confidence of all people.</p>
<p>John Adams said “It is religion and morality, alone, which can establish the principles uppon which freedom can securely stand.”</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln belonged to the first Presbyterian (christian) church in downtown Springfield. His family even owned a pew (seat) in the church for their family for $50.</p>
<p>No sense in haggling over which church or religion. The point is they were god fearing men who didnt want the government interfering directly, but the government was respectful of a god and the morality of Christ’s teachings.</p>

Our founders were all devout Christians. Every congressional session began with a prayer led by the congressional Chaplin. To this day that still goes on.</p>

<p>Not specifically on Christianity but on god and gods rule. i.e no killing, stealing, rape etc<br>

        <p>None of the founding fathers denied god, lets put it at that.</p>
<p>I was extending my comment, not contradicting myself, way to go.  Yakman, theres nothing i see in enlightenment that denies god. just an expectation of reasoning through evidence.</p>
<p>You’re both enlightened. Try responding to some of my other comments instead of pointing out how im contradicting myself.</p>
<p>We agree to disagree.</p>
<p>Maybe you should actually try to read what i said, but then again, you cant argue with atheists!</p>

<blockquote>I swear upon the altar of God, eternal hostility to every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
--Thomas Jefferson
<p>Anti-God/Government arguments:  This simply is not the nature of what we see today, in my opinion.  This “duel legacy” demonstrates a government that was ground in “divine law,” but would not subject to nor supportive of any religious entity, such as a church or particular faith.</p>
<p>Today’s “progressives” argue the separation of church and state as though the intention was separation of God and state.  This was simply not the case in any reputable historical document.</p>

        <p>You’re continuing to argue from a perspective that is not acknowledging the difference between church and state and god and state.</p>
<p>I get what you’re saying but it doesnt mean that our country was founded on secularism, thats simply not true. The whole reason for our country started over religion.</p>
<p>[quote=“Cain_”]Ahhhh huh. That’s why your constitution is a completely secular document right? That’s why there’s an explicit separation of church and state?</p>
<p>No but honestly, even if certain people based the laws in what they thought was “divine law”, doesn’t mean that the country itself is based on god. After all, there’s no law against eating shellfish, and there’s actually laws <span class="bbcode-i">against</span> killing your disobedient children.[/quote]<br>
The constitution is grounded by divine law, but its as you described, from an enlightnment perspective, one of reason and logic. You must be thinking its secular because it doesn’t mention the word god. It was a legal document, so it would make sense that the word god isnt mentioned. They didnt want the government interfering with private warship, its not their role. Thats why it was never mentioned in the constitution.</p>
<p>[quote=“Cain_”]Ah here we go. To show that this is complete bullshit, i’m going to quote the letter/s which were sent between Thomas Jefferson and the Danbury baptists. (“Oh no” Frell gasps, “Facts?!”)</p>
<p>[quote]<br>
The address of the Danbury Baptists Association in the state of<br>
Connecticut, assembled October 7, 1801. To Thomas Jefferson,<br>
Esq., President of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>Among the many million in America and Europe who rejoice in your<br>
election to office; we embrace the first opportunity which we<br>
have enjoyed in our collective capacity, since your inauguration,<br>
to express our great satisfaction, in your appointment to the<br>
chief magistracy in the United States: And though our mode of<br>
expression may be less courtly and pompous than what many others<br>
clothe their addresses with, we beg you, sir, to believe that<br>
none are more sincere.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Our sentiments are uniformly on the side of religious<br>
liberty–that religion is at all times and places a matter<br>
between God and individuals–that no man ought to suffer in name,<br>
person, or effects on account of his religious opinions–that the<br>
legitimate power of civil government extends no further than to<br>
punish the man who works ill to his neighbors; But, sir, our<br>
constitution of government is not specific.</span> Our ancient charter<br>
together with the law made coincident therewith, were adopted as<br>
the basis of our government, at the time of our revolution; and<br>
such had been our laws and usages, and such still are; that<br>
religion is considered as the first object of legislation; and<br>
therefore what religious privileges we enjoy (as a minor part of<br>
the state) we enjoy as favors granted, and not as inalienable<br>
rights; and these favors we receive at the expense of such<br>
degrading acknowledgements as are inconsistent with the rights of<br>
freemen. It is not to be wondered at therefore; if those who seek<br>
after power and gain under the pretense of government and<br>
religion should reproach their fellow men–should reproach their<br>
order magistrate, as a enemy of religion, law, and good order,<br>
because he will not, dare not, assume the prerogatives of Jehovah<br>
and make laws to govern the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p>Sir, we are sensible that the president of the United States is<br>
not the national legislator, and also sensible that the national<br>
government cannot destroy the laws of each state; but our hopes<br>
are strong that the sentiments of our beloved president, which<br>
have had such genial effect already, like the radiant beams of<br>
the sun, will shine and prevail through all these states and all<br>
the world, till hierarchy and tyranny be destroyed from the<br>
earth. Sir, when we reflect on your past services, and see a glow<br>
of philanthropy and good will shining forth in a course of more<br>
than thirty years we have reason to believe that America’s God<br>
has raised you up to fill the chair of state out of that goodwill<br>
which he bears to the millions which you preside over. May God<br>
strengthen you for your arduous task which providence and the<br>
voice of the people have called you to sustain and support you<br>
enjoy administration against all the predetermined opposition of<br>
those who wish to raise to wealth and importance on the poverty<br>
and subjection of the people.</p>
<p>And may the Lord preserve you safe from every evil and bring you<br>
at last to his heavenly kingdom through Jesus Christ our Glorious<br>
Mediator.</p>

<blockquote>"Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State. "</blockquote>
What he was saying is that government shouldn't get involved either way.
<p>Americans interpret the “wall” of separation to which he referred, to remove God in every way from our courts, money, documents, verbiage, etc. That was certainly not Jefferson’s intent by all accounts. He just meant that it would be prudent for government not get in the business of the manner in which people practice their religion or if they practiced at all. It was (and is) an individual choice.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a Godless society is a doomed society, as history has been made over and over, i.e., Rome, Greece, Egypt, Ancient Great Britain, etc., where the people failed to appreciate and honor morality on a national scale. Seems our Founders thought the same…and of course, it seems they appreciated that man can be moral and upright without participating in a religion if that was their choice and that citizens be free of persecution either way.</p>
<p>We agree to disagree. The country is secular in the sense that it doesn’t get involved with church and citizens but that doesn’t mean that the principles upon which the country was built is without regard to divine law. Its clear, based on history and tradition, as you say, that enough of the founders found it important to keep symbols of god on the fore front informally as a reminder.</p>

        <p>[quote=“yakman, post:94, topic:345519”]If America has such great freedom of/from religion, why is the phrase “under God” part of your pledge of allegiance? That doesn’t give much freedom to people who believe in more then one god or lack a belief altogether.</p>
<p>It seems to me this “RIGHT to practice what religion they wanted to or the RIGHT to have no religion at all” has been hijacked and now these freedoms are only given to a narrow part of the belief spectrum.[/quote]</p>
<p>I say ‘under God’ in the pledge of allegiance, but you don’t have to, and in fact in public schools and other governmental places where the pledge is said those words are omitted.  I believe those words were added later by someone, and they aren’t mandatory or official I don’t think.</p>
<p>Some of the founding fathers were Christian, but they chose to keep church and state completely separate, as it remains today.  There is no state religion whatsoever in the USA.</p>

        <p>No, its because im the only one on the forums that has the time to argue with people like you. Not only that, but you guys cant even argue (should say debate) in a sensible, humane way.</p>
<p>What is the point of this entire debate? Some of the founding fathers were religious, some may have not been. So what? Just because they didnt speak out loud and make their religion clear doesn’t mean they weren’t religious, they believed religion to be private. And it definitely doesn’t mean that they didnt choose to build the country based on some form of divine law. Just because they excluded god from the Constitution doesn’t prove anything, it was a legal document.</p>
<p>Separation of church and state and not god and state. By this i mean the government cant be in favor of a specific church (church and state), like showing interest/support in roman Catholics. Separation of church and state doesn’t mean they cant say or mention god when they speak. They just cant go into specifics.</p>
<p>Im not saying the US was found on Christianity. Im saying that the country was created with some form of higher power in mind.<br>

IIRC those were all doomed when people started to question their religion. Like when Rome split into Constantinople which had Christianity. I don’t know alot on that subject so i may be wrong. And i probably am, but sure enough you all attack it. Welcome to <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/">moparisthebest.com</a></p>

God’s law?<br>
Laws against murder, rape and stealing is not religious laws but laws necessary to make a stable society.<br>
The first amendment go against the first and second commandment, so why call it God’s laws?</p>

George Washington and John Adams both said that without a form of religion morality can’t be maintained.  They wanted a form of national morality across the US to ensure a stable society.</p>
<p>George Washington said “Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.”</p>
<p>John Adams said “It is religion and morality, alone, which can establish the principles uppon which freedom can securely stand.”</p>
<p>The first president and vice president said that.</p>

Argument from authority is a bad argument. You don’t need religion to maintain a stable society, you need someone to enforce the rules. People doesn’t need fairytales to behave after the law.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of religion? And yes nowadays you probably don’t need religion to enforce laws anymore. But you have to remember the time when the country was made, it was much more different.</p>

        <p>Actually I have to agree with frell (slightly) on this one, religion would have helped maintain a stable society more than people attempting to enforce the rules. If the country is brainwashed enough to believe that some god will smite them if they don’t behave and there’s nothing they can do about it, then they’ll behave. If people didn’t believe this, then they may realise that the people controlling them are just human, and it’s not fair that they should have so much unfair power over them. They’d have no fear of rioting etc, because they know an entire nation of people will support them. An religious nation know that they can’t over-power god.</p>
<p>Ofcourse, this wouldn’t apply today because people don’t take religion anywhere near as seriously as they used to.</p>
