              <p>Radeon’s article is nothing but a mixture of Non sequitur and Bare assertion logical fallacy.</p>
<p>However nobody seems to worry about logical fallacies these days, people are just content to have misinformation and fuzzy logic enter their heads.</p>
<p>About this censorious instinct: we basically know already what we need to know, and we’ve known it for a long time, it comes from an old story about a great Englishman – Dr Samuel Johnson, the great lexicographer, complier of the first great dictionary of the English language. When it was complete Dr Johnson was waited upon by various delegations of people to congratulate him. Of the nobility, of equality, of the Common, of the Lords and also by a delegation of respectable ladies of London who attended on him in his Fleet Street lodgings and congratulated him.</p>
<p>“Dr Johnson”, they said, “We are delighted to find that you’ve not included any indecent or obscene words in your dictionary.”</p>
<p>“Ladies”, said Dr Johnson, “I congratulate you on being able to look them up.”</p>
<p>If any of you can understand that, you get the point about the censorship instinct. For those who can’t I’ll summarise.<br>
You probably only want to censor something because you yourself secretly want to do it.</p>

<p>To bend the topic a bit: The ex-biggest party in the Netherlands, a christian party, even dared to say that our country would be worse without a christian PM. Luckily they got decimated in the last elections. The leader of this party also whined about the lack of ‘Dutch East Indies Company-mentality’. Ah… the good old slave trading times.

<p>REALLY Frell? If a cornerstone of your argument is that rape/theft/whatever isn’t allowed because it also happens to be a commandment, therefore supporting whatever you were saying(kinda skimmed a lot of it !) then you really need a new fucking argument. Wow.</p>
<p>[quote=“Frell, post:113, topic:345519”]No, its because im the only one on the forums that has the time to argue with people like you. Not only that, but you guys cant even argue (should say debate) in a sensible, humane way.</p>

<p>Think of every idea that has shaped society, that has drastically changed our views, and made us see ourselves in a different perspective. Whether it has been television, the internet, video games or pornography; the only thing people were afraid of is going against what they believe and value. You can’t corrupt society. It’s ever-evolving. It’s all of us, just thinking and doing. The only thing you can corrupt is the morals, values and beliefs which your friends, family, peers and idols may have influenced you to abide by.</p>
<p>The brain has been doing exactly what it evolved to do. Pretty much voids your entire argument.</p>

<p>Oh right, I totally missed this part. I wish HexKey was still here, he’d not only get a kick out of it but I’m sure he could tell you you’re dumb much more eloquently than I can.</p>
<p>EDIT But since he isn’t:</p>
<p>I’m reluctant to accept the label “addictive” as an alternative term for “habit forming”. Somewhere in recent years the word addictive changed from having an actual concrete meaning to meaning “I have a habit” or “I’m too much of a pussy to take control of my own life”. Regardless, since everyone else is using it to mean this (“mental” addiction - lol.) I guess I’ll concede that under this definition, sure, porn is probably addictive in certain individuals - in the same way that using the internet is, playing games is and posting on forums is (you better get off the computer now, for fear of ruining your family life).</p>
<p>As for “psychotropic drug stores” in the brain - they don’t exist. Pretty much by definition, “drug” doesn’t include endogenous substances. I’d ask for more explanation of what you think that line meant, but what I’d get would be some bullshit about the reward mechanisms in the human brain and a big fat misunderstanding of how neurotransmitters and the CNS in general work, and nobody needs to read those articles again, they’re the food of concerned mothers everywhere already. (OMG OUR CHILDREN ARE ADDICTED TO PLEASURE, DAMN THAT DOPAMINE IT MAKES VIDEO GAMES LIKE COCAINE!).</p>
<p>If you want to have an argument about the social impact of pornography, or well anything else, I’d love to do it, chatting shit on the internet is my game.</p>
<p>But please fuck keep the pseudo science out of it. Read a goddamn book or something before you go there, or people are just going to laugh at you. The brain doing what it has evolved to do is not a valid argument for banning everything pleasurable in life.</p>
<p>EDIT2: I forgot I can’t use the word designed with regards to the brain in this context due to present company misunderstanding it</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How exactly is porn guilty?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It corrupts society. Have you not considered that it fuels man’s sexual desires, causing one to expect more out of their partner? More than what is realistically possible?</p>
<blockquote>Pornography is a visual representation of sexuality which distorts an
individual’s concept of the nature of conjugal relations. This, in turn, alters both
sexual attitudes and behavior. It is a major threat to marriage, to family, to
children and to individual happiness. In undermining marriage it is one of the
factors in undermining social stability.
Social scientists, clinical psychologists, and biologists have begun to clarify some
of the social and psychological effects, and neurologists are beginning to
delineate the biological mechanisms through which pornography produces its
powerful negative effects.
KEY FINDINGS ON THE EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHY
THE FAMILY AND PORNOGRAPHY
• Married men who are involved in pornography feel less satisfied with
their conjugal relations and less emotionally attached to their wives.
Wives notice and are upset by the difference.
• Pornography use is a pathway to infidelity and divorce, and is frequently
a major factor in these family disasters.
• Among couples affected by one spouse’s addiction, two-thirds experience
a loss of interest in sexual intercourse.
• Both spouses perceive pornography viewing as tantamount to infidelity.
• Pornography viewing leads to a loss of interest in good family relations.
THE INDIVIDUAL AND PORNOGRAPHY
• Pornography is addictive, and neuroscientists are beginning to map the
biological substrate of this addiction.
• Users tend to become desensitized to the type of pornorgraphy they use,
become bored with it, and then seek more perverse forms of pornography.
•
•
•
•
Men who view pornography regularly have a higher tolerance for
abnormal sexuality, including rape, sexual aggression, and sexual
promiscuity.
Prolonged consumption of pornography by men produces stronger
notions of women as commodities or as “sex objects.”
Pornography engenders greater sexual permissiveness, which in turn
leads to a greater risk of out-of-wedlock births and STDs. These, in turn,
lead to still more weaknesses and debilities.
Child-sex offenders are more likely to view pornography regularly or to
be involved in its distribution.
OTHER EFFECTS OF PORNOGRAPHY
• Many adolescents who view pornography initially feel shame, diminished
self-confidence, and sexual uncertainty, but these feelings quickly shift to
unadulterated enjoyment with regular viewing.
• The presence of sexually oriented businesses significantly harms the
surrounding community, leading to increases in crime and decreases in
property values.
• The main defenses against pornography are close family life, a good
marriage and good relations between parents and children, coupled with
deliberate parental monitoring of Internet use. Traditionally, government
has kept a tight lid on sexual traffic and businesses, but in matters of
pornography that has waned almost completely, except where child
pornography is concerned. Given the massive, deleterious individual,
marital, family, and social effects of pornography, it is time for citizens,
communities, and government to reconsider their laissez-faire approach.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since the brain believes what the eyes see, in 3/10ths of a second, real, virtual or pseudo
pornography restructures the brains-minds and memories of participants or even casual viewers. That
the brain’s “internal drug store” produces mood altering psychotropic drugs, and that right hemisphere
emotions including fear, joy, anger, lust (instant rewards) dominate the left hemisphere’s cognitive
functions of speech, rationality, logic (delayed rewards), further implicates pictorial pornography as
causally changing the nature of the polity. The massive quantifiable increases and qualifiably more
sadistic and barbaric kinds of sexual crime since 1950, supports the breeding of a sadistic, pedophile
consciousness in pornography consumers. A picture is worth more than a thousand words and even
weighty words (unless repetitively broadcast in popularly credible forums) rarely cause long-lasting
cellular change.
The “law of strength” finds pictorial pornography reflexively and mechanically restructuring
the brain; involuntary cellular change takes place even during sleep, resisting informed consent, with
left-brain dominance abrogating genuine free speech. Further, that children and non-readers
accurately decode and “copy” visual images in any language establishes the non speech or anti speech
nature of visual media.</blockquote>

<p>Hehe, indeed. My impression from reading Touch Wood (admittedly a biased point of view given that its the anecdotes of a porn director) was that most of the girls get incredibly pissed off when people “feel sorry for them” too - as if they’re too stupid to know what they’re doing or wouldn’t do it if they “understood” or w/e. Such a patronising view.</p>
<p>Also, everyone should read that book, it’s hilarious. Just treat it as a comedy rather than accurate documentary and don’t read it if you get grossed out easily, heh.</p>
