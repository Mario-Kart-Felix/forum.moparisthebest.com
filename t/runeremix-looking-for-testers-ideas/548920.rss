    <description>Hey

I need feedback on some of the ideas I&#39;m working on.

And test out the server while I&#39;m working.

For now I&#39;m working on the site and working out the ideas I have.
So for those who would like to help me in this procces, feel free to join me on the forum or reply here.

All Ideas are posted here: [url=http://&quot;http://runeremix.com/news.php&quot;]runeremix.com/news.php[/url]
(All ideas that include custom items will be ignored)

Some pictures:

It&#39;s one server, but multiple worlds. A world can be hosted anywhere (all server we use are free, hosted by me or some friends). In this example world 4 has a very low ping, this is because the server is hosted at my own house.
You always keep your progress while switching a world. Friend chat does show you friends in others worlds with world number and you can PM them.

Clan chats is missing, I am going to add it soon, with cross world chat like PM&#39;s.
