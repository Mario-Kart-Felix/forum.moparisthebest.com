    <description>Welcome to project MiamiScape!
We would first like to start out with:[IMG]http://i37.tinypic.com/2e6eoo9.gif[/img]

Ok,
So now...

Project MiamiScape will include PK area, and a trading area. This server will somewhat be more like runescape itself. We hope to intergrate our website and server. Which means we will be looking for someone to code a server which comes with MySQL. We will have access to a CentOS server. We will now post positions below:

[b]Positions[/b]

[ul][li]Graphics (1)[/li]
[li]Server Coders(2)[/li]
[li]Website Coders (1)[/li]
[li]MySQL coder (1-2)[/li][/ul]


Now... We will be looking for these positions to be filled. Once we start I will update this post with further information.
We plan to release server info a couple months after coding starts. But if we get good coders, then it could be done soon.
