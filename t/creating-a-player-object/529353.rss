    <title>Creating a player object</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-player-object/529353</link>
    <description>I&#39;m writing a somewhat title system for my client, but I&#39;m coming across some troubles when I&#39;m trying to display them in the chat area.

I know where the problem lies, I just don&#39;t know how to create the Player object in order to display the titles being sent from the server for each individual player and because there is no Player parameter, I&#39;m confused.

I tried looping through the players and assigning it like that 
[code=java]
for (int i = 0; i &lt; playerCount; i++) {
Player player = playerArray[i];
}[/code]
but that just gives me multiple lines of text which I don&#39;t want.

This is what I need I believe
&lt;blockquote&gt;j2 += textDrawingArea.getTextWidth(chatNames[k]) + textDrawingArea.getTextWidth(player.getPlayerTitle()) + &quot;:&quot;.length();
drawBasicString(Colours.getColourByName(&quot;dark orange&quot;) + [b]player.[/b]getPlayerTitle() + &quot; &quot; + Colours.getColourByName(&quot;red&quot;) + this.optimizeText(chatNames[k]) + &quot;:&quot;, j2, yPos, 0x7e3200, -1);&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Can someone give me some guidance?</description>
