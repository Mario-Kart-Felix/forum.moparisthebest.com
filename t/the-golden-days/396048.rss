    <title>The Golden Days</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-golden-days/396048</link>
    <description>I miss the days of moparscape and silabsoft.  When you didn&#39;t need to download a client for every new server you played.  When you trained on doors and attack dummies.  When SyiPkers were the big scare and hardly anyone knew how to how to dupe.  Those were the golden days of RSPS.  A person would post their server on the Status page and instantly get 10-20 players without even trying.  It would be a very good thing just to stay above 90% uptime.

Now, there&#39;s all these dedicated servers, vps hosting, servers making thousands of dollars.  The fun has been sucked out of private servers and it has basically become a business.  What made RSPS fun was the fact that the servers were so much easier than rs and everything was so simple.  Now, the new servers try to be so much like runescape.  I think I would rather play the real Rs then some look alike that could never amount to the real thing.

Just a small rant... agree, disagree, it doesn&#39;t really matter.
I for one have done my best to bring back the old.

Thanks for Reading</description>

<p>The ones i remember the most were the silab ones since I played way more of those than mopar ones, because of the fact that silab was just becoming the new thing when I started.  But the source I remember the most is one where train was at the falador fountain, with barbarians, the npcs that dropped third age like the zammy mage, and barrows ghosts</p>
