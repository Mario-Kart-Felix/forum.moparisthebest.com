    <title>The Golden Days</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-golden-days/415308</link>
    <description>I miss the days of moparscape and silabsoft.  When you didn&#39;t need to download a client for every new server you played.  When you trained on doors and attack dummies.  When SyiPkers were the big scare and hardly anyone knew how to how to dupe.  Those were the golden days of RSPS.  A person would post their server on the Status page and instantly get 10-20 players without even trying.  It would be a very good thing just to stay above 90% uptime.

Now, there&#39;s all these dedicated servers, vps hosting, servers making thousands of dollars.  The fun has been sucked out of private servers and it has basically become a business.  What made RSPS fun was the fact that the servers were so much easier than rs and everything was so simple.  Now, the new servers try to be so much like runescape.  I think I would rather play the real Rs then some look alike that could never amount to the real thing.

Just a small rant... agree, disagree, it doesn&#39;t really matter.
I for one have done my best to bring back the old.

Thanks for Reading

This was by mr dope
This topic was accually nice to read because it brings back moments for old rsps players
Plus the idea to make money from people on rsps is dumb the owners can get a job and work for 
a living not make money from players who have almost no money from donating to them
When people donate you know your just giving your money away to some guy who cant make his own
and gives you a cool simbal and later on when you have like 100b shuts down the server so whats the 
point of donating mr dope is right he did has been trying to keep it old he accually hosts 
a allstarscape source what is currently down atm soon to be back up dont judge him
he accually is a nice guy who does know how to code he accually has one of the best
allstar anti nullers and anti duper atm :p he also has added alot of stuff since his last release
i&#39;m saying this because im one of his veteran&#39;s i bet he is smarter than alot of you first because he
doesnt troll like alot of mopar players and he is accually in collage atm and has been coding for along time!

Thanks :p</description>

Well for the reason that they don’t want everyone to use them… they would make more tbh sometimes hosting it. But I could also see that leachers would pose the server as theirs, so on, so forth…</p>

I actually found Moparscape through Dodian, in mid-late 06.  It might not have been nearly as big back then,  can’t remember.</p>

<p>Agreed,  the only time I see an ok donator feature is a colored name and possibly a crown.  Only to signify that user has donated. Nothing more should be required.</p>

              <p>Reminds me of a server called “Combattscape”. It was my first RsPs. I was playing it about 8 months and then someone teached me how to dupe, I duped 24-7 :D. Then a Co-owner got hacked and gave 3 ppl mod (include me) to ban everyone that comes online and he also gave his Perfect rings, Witch I duped and gave to a dubbel account. Then when we got demoted and everything was fine I still had the Perfect rings with me. Few days after server went down… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

              <p>[quote=“blddyboy, post:1, topic:415308”]I miss the days of moparscape and silabsoft.  When you didn’t need to download a client for every new server you played.  When you trained on doors and attack dummies.  When SyiPkers were the big scare and hardly anyone knew how to how to dupe.  Those were the golden days of RSPS.  A person would post their server on the Status page and instantly get 10-20 players without even trying.  It would be a very good thing just to stay above 90% uptime.</p>
<p>Now, there’s all these dedicated servers, vps hosting, servers making thousands of dollars.  The fun has been sucked out of private servers and it has basically become a business.  What made RSPS fun was the fact that the servers were so much easier than rs and everything was so simple.  Now, the new servers try to be so much like runescape.  I think I would rather play the real Rs then some look alike that could never amount to the real thing.</p>
<p>Just a small rant… agree, disagree, it doesn’t really matter.<br>
I for one have done my best to bring back the old.</p>
<p>Thanks for Reading</p>
<p>This was by mr dope<br>
This topic was accually nice to read because it brings back moments for old rsps players<br>
Plus the idea to make money from people on rsps is dumb the owners can get a job and work for<br>
a living not make money from players who have almost no money from donating to them<br>
When people donate you know your just giving your money away to some guy who cant make his own<br>
and gives you a cool simbal and later on when you have like 100b shuts down the server so whats the<br>
point of donating mr dope is right he did has been trying to keep it old he accually hosts<br>
a allstarscape source what is currently down atm soon to be back up dont judge him<br>
he accually is a nice guy who does know how to code he accually has one of the best<br>
allstar anti nullers and anti duper atm <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> he also has added alot of stuff since his last release<br>
i’m saying this because im one of his veteran’s i bet he is smarter than alot of you first because he<br>
doesnt troll like alot of mopar players and he is accually in collage atm and has been coding for along time!</p>
<p>Thanks :p[/quote]<br>
Wow… sounded like fun. I wish I was here that long ago  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Oh… I thought the golden days were before the silabsoft client, and before SYIPkPker.  When the entire server was based around Varrock east bank and the dummies across the street.  When there were no money making skills, you just ran to pick up a cash pile and run back to buy armor.  Pk, wash, rinse, repeat.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Careful buddy! Your starting to sound like Lin!</p>
<p>Haha just kidding, I agree 100 percent that those were the best days for me personally. But we have to take into account that we were so much younger and it was all new to us. The server developers were also very young as well. As the server developers grew older they saw that their servers could make money and thats what ruined it for us all. I remember the first private server to ever be hosted on a vps people were dumbfounded that it could be up /infinitely/ without any downtime.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t mind making an old school server though mdog. Maybe you and I could start something and not give up for once?</p>
