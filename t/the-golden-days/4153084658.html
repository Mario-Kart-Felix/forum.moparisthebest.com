<p>Dodian was what, late 2007? The first one I remember ever playing on that had a VPS was… pkisle of course. Bezza was about 17 or 18 back then and he was already in it for the money. He may well have been the first person to ever ask for donations other then RS Gold.</p>

I actually found Moparscape through Dodian, in mid-late 06.  It might not have been nearly as big back then,  can’t remember.</p>

Well for the reason that they don’t want everyone to use them… they would make more tbh sometimes hosting it. But I could also see that leachers would pose the server as theirs, so on, so forth…</p>

<p>Not many people here have the knowledge or time to create something efficient. If I am correct, only a couple or a few people have been paid for this reason right?</p>
<p>The only direction I see the money going is in MITB’s pocket, I have not seen it used in any other way. I don’t like the idea of sponsored servers in communities that promote the development of RSPS. Who wants to develop a serious server that will take days to program when the maximum players you’re going to get is 5-20, even when you’re paying for a VPS?</p>
<p>I’ve seen the accepted bids and the kind of money that comes in each month for voting. No one can try and tell me there wouldn’t be enough money to pay for dozens of people if they developed efficient servers.</p>

What can be done about it though, we offer thousands of dollars for people to make private server stuff and no one’s even interested =/<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Not many people here have the knowledge or time to create something efficient. If I am correct, only a couple or a few people have been paid for this reason right?</p>
<p>The only direction I see the money going is in MITB’s pocket, I have not seen it used in any other way. I don’t like the idea of sponsored servers in communities that promote the development of RSPS. Who wants to develop a serious server that will take days to program when the maximum players you’re going to get is 5-20, even when you’re paying for a VPS?</p>
<p>I’ve seen the accepted bids and the kind of money that comes in each month for voting. No one can try and tell me there wouldn’t be enough money to pay for dozens of people if they developed efficient servers.[/quote]The only people capable of completing such a project is a team that is willing to work together. I’ve watched a few groups attempt at the offer MITB has had up for the past few years and every time it ends horribly.</p>
<p>I admit, I’m not the best programmer in town, let alone relevant at all to what is made on this forum now-a-days. But if there were ever a serious team, I would love to be part of it. Even if that meant having the lowest position possible. This forum is about development and cooperation.</p>
