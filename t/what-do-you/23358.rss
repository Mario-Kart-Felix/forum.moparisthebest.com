    <description>Hey just wondering what everyone autoes , how often , which script whether private or public and much you make off it


i just started autoing alot because i got my really good computer in a few days ago (after 3 months) :eek: which has a really good video card so im open to alot more scripts but right now im powermining about 10 acc&#39;s all lv 3 and if they make it to 60 mining with out getting banned then i figure i will up+ there combat level
i havnt really made any cash off it other than a few mills from feathers befor everyone started alot =P
so how about everyone else?</description>
