    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-please-help-how-to-stop-a-dupe-that-works-on-my-server/389396</link>
    <description>Okay recently, there has been partyhats everywhere on my server. And I received a PM from someone telling me how people are doing the dupe, they are using &quot;Cheat engine 6.0&quot;, And they linked me to a youtube tutorial that shows you how to do the dupe
here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaFWXTYcinI

I&#39;m not sure How i would fix  :(, I really need someones help if they could help me to patch this dupe i&#39;ll send them $5 Paypal.

If you are interested in helping me for paypal or for free, contact me on my msn:
