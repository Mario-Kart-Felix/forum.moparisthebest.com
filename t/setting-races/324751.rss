    <description>For my server, I want to make it so that when you choose whatever statue for the team you want to be on when you first sign in, it will do something like with the starter command, how it writes &quot;starter = 0&quot; when you haven&#39;t used it and &quot;starter = 1&quot; when you have. I get the general idea of what I want to do, but I don&#39;t know how to do it. Like... I want it to be if they choose the zamorak statue, it writes &quot;race = 1&quot;, guthix it would write &quot;race = 2&quot;, and saradomin &quot;race = 3&quot; and stuff. What is the code I would have to put on the case label for the statues, and any other files to get it to save correctly?</description>
