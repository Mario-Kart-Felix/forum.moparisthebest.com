    <title>Port Forward</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forward/421957</link>
    <description>There seems to be &quot;many a question&quot; to this and I&#39;ve spent enough time looking around for a solution.

I&#39;ve actually followed all the steps to set up a server which is meant to be played only to some people at school.

I use a rooter *Livebox idkwhichmodelnaow* and opened a port 43594. However I checked on canyouseeme.org and port is closed. Server keeps listening to port. I checked mostly everything. I&#39;m totally unfamiliar with Java or programming in general so I&#39;d like some help.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>So, what was your problem exactly? if you need some help port forwarding, go to Command Prompt and type ‘ipconfig’ and find your default gateway. type your default gateway into into your browser and it should come up with your gateway. navigate to ‘Firewall’ and somewhere on your firewall, it should have ‘Assign a game or application to a local network device’. click that and then find ‘Create a new game or application’ click that. where it says Name: type your server name. click next, and it should show up asking what port you want to use, just type 43594 or 5555. now go back to ‘Assign a game or application to a local network device’ and it should have your game and applications there. and it should have an ‘add’ button. add your server you just created, then select your computer tick the box and continue. then your done.</p>
