    <title>[NOT SOLVED] Need help with no-ip/portforwarding please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-solved-need-help-with-no-ip-portforwarding-please/397990</link>
    <description>So, first of all im still pretty new at runescape private servers and i need some help.
*I have a source, and a client (317&#39;s)
*Got them to work with hamachi
*Everything runs fine

BUT i don&#39;t want it to be a hamachi server, so i looked into port forwarding my router,
I port forwarded ports 43594 on both TCP and UDP and used a few different portcheckers to see if it opened, it did.
I then registered for No-ip and downloaded it, made a host and edited that into my client where my hamachi ip was and compiled it.
It wouldn&#39;t connect...
Got a fresh client, tried the no-ip address i made from their website,and it wouldn&#39;t connect.

Did i miss a step? Can anyone help me?</description>
