    <title>Banning Rights [667]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/banning-rights-667/555079</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve figured the easiest way to ban someone who &quot;obtains&quot; rights the wrong way is to ban them if there rights are a certain level and there name isn&#39;t my name, has this been done before and is it easy? I take it it&#39;s under player and you get the persons rights and if it&#39;s 12 and there name isn&#39;t mine it ipbans them?</description>

<p>It’s been done plenty in the past, and is a terrible solution to a vulnerable server.<br>
Players shouldn’t just be able to “obtain rights” that you don’t want them to have. At the <span class="bbcode-b">most</span> they should be able to edit <span class="bbcode-b">their client</span> so it shows a crown. But because that’d only be client sided, their crown would be literally useless.</p>
<p>You should also have some form of a staff list as is… Not just for security, but for management.</p>
<p>As for implementation, I don’t work with 667 so I’m not very much help.</p>
<p>The list could be as simple as an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ArrayList</a> or even just an array.<br>
You can use Strings to hold player names in it. On server start have that list populate with player names (Whether by external file or not).<br>
If a player logs in and they have staff, but they’re not in that list, remove their rights or ban them or whatever you want.</p>
<p>You could also use a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HashMap</a> where the key would be the player name, and the value is their rights. This is a bit more secure as you can force specific players on certain rights, and if they change them; the server can force it back.<br>
I.e:</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
private HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt; staffList = new HashMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;();</p>
<p>private static void test() {<br>
staffList.put(“dillo1000”, 12);<br>
}</p>
<p>public static void run() {<br>
test();<br>
int testRights= 10;<br>
int listRights = staffList.get(“dillo1000”);<br>
if(testRights != listRights) {<br>
testRights = listRights;<br>
}<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>That’s just an example though, you’d have to make it work how you wanted.</p>
