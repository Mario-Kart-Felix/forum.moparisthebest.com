    <title>SOCKS5 Proxy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/socks5-proxy/195085</link>
    <description>I am trying to setup up a SOCKS5 proxy to use at school, and I was wondering if anyone had any idea where I could find any info on how to set one up. I tried Google, but it just made me mad cause all it gave me was FoxyProxy and i couldn&#39;t get it to work after putting in the correct info. If anyone could give me either a link to a tutorial or post a couple of links to some SOCKS5 Proxys, that would be really helpful.

P.S. I need for school so try to make sure they aren&#39;t very common if you post links please.
