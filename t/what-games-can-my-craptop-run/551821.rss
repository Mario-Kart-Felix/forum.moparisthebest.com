    <title>What games can my craptop run?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-games-can-my-craptop-run/551821</link>
    <description>Been looking to play some new games lately.. And the biggest issue is hardware requirements. I get lag on runescape with max settings.. so there&#39;s that.

Specs:
CPU: Intel Core i3 2350M @2.30GHz
Graphics: Intel Chipset 3000 (Yay for integrated piles of shit!)
RAM: 6GB
Hard Drive: 1TB + 4TB external.
OS: Windows 7 Ultimate.

I played League in the past.. But the game was laggy (EUW servers + Shit graphics). And I played one of the Killing Floor games (It had some lag) but that&#39;s really about it. Been trying to get a tower pc so I can upgrade it as I go.</description>

<p>Your suggestions weren’t. Neither were pure’s.<br>
It’s just that I didn’t think you needed a direct reply saying I was gonna go download the games…<br>
Especially since they’re N64 games, and I actually own a N64… I’ve got both zelda’s and Perfect Dark… That I can find.</p>

I ran some games like some of the NFS’s, and Goat Simulator and such with no problems, and just a few graphical glitches. What type of games are you into?</p>

You probably burnt the laptop out because you were playing games that took too much XD.<br>
I’m more into horror.<br>
Shit like Slenderman is a joke though. That isn’t scary. That’s funny…</p>

              <p>You have similar specs to my old laptop before it burnt up and I built a PC lol. You can play pretty much any source game, if you haven’t played the portal or half-life series, definitely recommend it. I played games like From The Depths, Kerbal, which were both made in Unity. That laptop ran most Unity based games pretty well except for games like The Forest. I ran some games like some of the NFS’s, and Goat Simulator and such with no problems, and just a few graphical glitches. What type of games are you into?</p>

              <p>Been looking to play some new games lately… And the biggest issue is hardware requirements. I get lag on runescape with max settings… so there’s that.</p>
<p>Specs:<br>
CPU: Intel Core i3 2350M <span class="mention">@2.30GHz</span><br>
Graphics: Intel Chipset 3000 (Yay for integrated piles of shit!)<br>
RAM: 6GB<br>
Hard Drive: 1TB + 4TB external.<br>
OS: Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>I played League in the past… But the game was laggy (EUW servers + Shit graphics). And I played one of the Killing Floor games (It had some lag) but that’s really about it. Been trying to get a tower pc so I can upgrade it as I go.</p>
