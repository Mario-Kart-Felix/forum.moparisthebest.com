    <title>[Pi}Weird Shop Bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-weird-shop-bug/397550</link>
    <description>So I am having this weird problem with my sources shops...Just some of them (as far as I can tell at least it could be all?) will constantly reopen back up after you click close window. Another problem is one of my shops when you click on it it spams in the chatbox the amount of server points you have(should only say it once). I have already attempted to restore my shophandler and shopassistant files to an older date however this did not fix the issue. 

I did some more research and there is a frame 248 that I deleted while working on a deadlock fix( I removed the synchronized from it. ).

Now my question is this what else could cause a shop to do this? I added back the synchronized that was referring to that frame248 in playerassistant.java just to see if it would fix it and it did not.</description>
