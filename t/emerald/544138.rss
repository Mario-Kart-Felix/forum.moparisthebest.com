[u][b]Introduction[/b][/u]

Emerald is an open source framework that has been in development for about a week now. I started this project purely for learning purposes so any harsh constructive criticism is welcome here. I do admit that I&#39;m not really taking this seriously, its mainly something I do in my spare time when I&#39;m bored and have nothing else better to do.


[u][b]Design &amp; Progress[/b][/u]

Emerald utilizes raw NIO networking in a semi-optimistic concurrency controlled environment to provide a fast and scalable server that has been designed to emulate the #317 protocol. While writing this I&#39;m trying to use many programming techniques that I am unfamiliar with in order to escape my comfort zone, which will hopefully make me a better developer.


[u]What I&#39;ve done so far[/u]

Unit testing is testing chunks of code. The OP should already being doing this. What I think Vix meant was you have to do unit tests regardless so it kinda is a irrelevant thing to say.</p>
<p>“Make sure you’re testing your code!”</p>

              <p>Ilu bby lets make out</p>
<p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:21, topic:544138”]Woah, relax. I was not saying you do not have success or questioning your ability as a programmer. This was simply regarding the advice you give to other people. I can’t think of a term to describe it, but you are overreacting and it wasn’t intended to be a personal attack on your abilities. If I was to put a tl;dr I would say your advice is… inconsistent, and not pragmatic.</p>
<p>I don’t want to go too in depth trying to defend myself about my development, but I will say a little bit about your implications. DavidScape… I myself have called it a bag of shit and it’s something I haven’t really touched in like 3 years for that reason. I started it when I had never looked at Java before (it started out as a 317 based off dds-specz I believe, then I moved to 508 6 months later I think? nostalgia man, I remember programming drinking beer and getting drunk and feeling amazing). 2006scape I worked on just because I was bored and for the potential to work on a popular source, and left, just like you. As for scape-emu, you are wrong on both counts. It wasn’t yours and I’m not branding it as my own. Even after you left I added you to the license which wasn’t there previously and kept you listed on the thread, and give you full credit for everything you did. And that doesn’t only apply to scape-emu, DavidScape also always had the base listed <span class="bbcode-i">in the title</span>, because I felt that was the most fair.</p>
<p>Sure, RSPS is something I do not have interest to develop from scratch. I have said that many times because my interest regarding RSPS is <span class="bbcode-i">content</span> development. Its just how RSPS is done for the most part. But like you, I also develop outside of this site.</p>
<p>But yea, that’s all I’m going to say about that. I didn’t mean to try and insinuate an attack on your abilities, I will easily admit you are a more skilled java developer than myself. You just sometimes don’t give very useful/pragmatic/relevant/whatever advice.[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay. I didn’t mean to insinuate a fight. I was just reminiscing, remembering things like that make me chuckle. So many memories.</p>

              <p>Woah, relax. I was not saying you do not have success or questioning your ability as a programmer. This was simply regarding the advice you give to other people. I can’t think of a term to describe it, but you are overreacting and it wasn’t intended to be a personal attack on your abilities. If I was to put a tl;dr I would say your advice is… inconsistent, and not pragmatic.</p>
<p>I don’t want to go too in depth trying to defend myself about my development, but I will say a little bit about your implications. DavidScape… I myself have called it a bag of shit and it’s something I haven’t really touched in like 3 years for that reason. I started it when I had never looked at Java before (it started out as a 317 based off dds-specz I believe, then I moved to 508 6 months later I think? nostalgia man, I remember programming drinking beer and getting drunk and feeling amazing). 2006scape I worked on just because I was bored and for the potential to work on a popular source, and left, just like you. As for scape-emu, you are wrong on both counts. It wasn’t yours and I’m not branding it as my own. Even after you left I added you to the license which wasn’t there previously and kept you listed on the thread, and give you full credit for everything you did. And that doesn’t only apply to scape-emu, DavidScape also always had the base listed <span class="bbcode-i">in the title</span>, because I felt that was the most fair.</p>
<p>Sure, RSPS is something I do not have interest to develop from scratch. I have said that many times because my interest regarding RSPS is <span class="bbcode-i">content</span> development. Its just how RSPS is done for the most part. But like you, I also develop outside of this site.</p>
<p>But yea, that’s all I’m going to say about that. I didn’t mean to try and insinuate an attack on your abilities, I will easily admit you are a more skilled java developer than myself. You just sometimes don’t give very useful/pragmatic/relevant/whatever advice.</p>

              <p>You do understand a lot of my projects also fall off the scope of this website. That’s a pretty narrow minded assumption. It’s huge where I work because of the agile development we do. I hop projects because I want to do different things. Success is defined by your failures and your successes, I’ve had equally if not more of the first but I sure as hell know a lot. I know what works, what doesn’t work, and where the trends lie. I have a method for writing a server from scratch and I love to change it up and try new things. I guess you could say I’ve grown a ‘I Don’t Really Give a Fuck Anymore’ attitude about RSPS. It’s kinda funny my resounding successes with people are actually what I consider failures and my triumphs are not usually noted heavily by people as I will. Frankly it doesn’t bother me. Don’t act like you don’t play the same game. I wouldn’t call Davidscape a success, it’s a gargantuan nightmare of epic proportions but in the eyes of the user it’s a success to them and that’s why its popular. Who are you to criticize me when I’m transparent about my development where as you: Created a forsaken Palidino 508 fork that was popular for the sake it resembled a PI, leeched an INFAMOUSLY bad source from an INFAMOUSLY bad operator and branded it as your own, and also used something I created and branded it as your own. I see a lack of creativity and innovation, and that’s where you will always lag behind because you’re only good at one thing which you can extrapolate from the examples I listed above.</p>

<p>No but seriously, it’s just a habit of yours. You are very narrow minded and tend to scope into one thing and then later completely forget about it and move on to something else. Can be seen in your constant project hopping, varied code writing styles, etc. You tend to be very adamant on one thing until you see something else. So what I’m saying to lare is that writing unit tests is useful in moderation, but just flatly telling someone to ‘write unit tests’ is not only vague but could lead him down a path that isn’t actually a pragmatic approach to developing his server.</p>

<p>I’ve been using unit tests for awhile but recently I’ve been using them more rigorously. There’s a structure behind them, and the proper usage mostly follows the guidelines of using a framework so I don’t think that would count. What are you, an expect? I mean by what I’ve seen, I dunno.</p>
