    <description>This appears in my runserver thing every once in a while..:



I&#39;m talking about after where it says Zer0z7 signed on.

EDIT: Also, I meant to put this last night but the forums were down.. every once in a while the server boots everyone, but we can all log right back in a second later and if you were fighting like a monster and it had half hp, it&#39;d still have half. (anyone know a solution to all the server boots?..)

This is what I read when that happens, and this is on the MoparScape client not the runserver:

I see this on other servers to when this happens.</description>

<p>Thanks everyone… doesn’t sound like a big problem and<br>
how do I edit where it saves?</p>
<p>I’m new at servers[br][size=1]Posted on: February 26, 2007, 03:01:56 PM[/size][hr]and my trade logs… they are in a different file but they appear there too…</p>
<p>I just checked and it was trades from last night.[br][size=1]Posted on: February 26, 2007, 03:07:02 PM[/size][hr][quote=“jehanne, post:7, topic:62106”][quote author=CRIPZ Chick link=topic=89603.msg945184#msg945184 date=1172533901]<br>
It shows what every one is spawning and if any player types :: (and then a command) It will show you  who typed it or who crashed the server and all.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>nobody typed anything. its just a wrong path in client.java[/quote]</p>
<p>Is this bad… will it effect anything? and how do I fix it?</p>
