    <description>Nice, you completely removed my posts... ive been gone for 2 hours lol, and looked upto page 40... on both SECTIONS... Help, and QUESTIONS... no way could they have gone further...

They were VERY simple questions....

1st) In the top right hand corner of my server, there is a flashing box... It says stuff like &quot;Alchemy&quot; &quot;Pizzazz points ETC...&quot; There were posts back to say, &quot;(Its probably your main menu)&quot; ** Answer to that question = Main menu information, is in client.java... i have searched every word that it says in the flashing box, in client.java.. Nothing IS THERE! **...
Another was, check your other files... ** Answer to that = Lol? there are many files-.-.. **
C&#39;mon Someone must know!!?!?!!... Please... Lol i will stop posting if someone just helps me?

2nd) 
[code]
if(command.startsWith(&quot;setname&quot;))
{
	currentTarget = command.substring(8);

[/code]
[code]
} else if(command.startsWith(&quot;trgtalk&quot;)) {
	client theGuy = (client)server.playerHandler.players[getCurrID()];
	theGuy.txt4 = command.substring(8);
	theGuy.string4UpdateRequired = true;
}
[/code]
This code below, goes above boolean process

[code]
public int getCurrID()
{
	int theID = 0;
	for(int l = 0; l &lt; server.playerHandler.players.length; l++)
		if(server.playerHandler.players[l] != null)
			if(server.playerHandler.players[l].playerName == currentTarget)
				theID = l;
			else
				theID = playerId;
return theID;
}
[/code]
So, anyone any ideas to any of them??
