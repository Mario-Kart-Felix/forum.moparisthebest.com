    <title>Should British Police Have Guns?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-british-police-have-guns/509461</link>
    <description>At the moment the normal british police officer does carry a gun and if a gun is needed then the armed response unit is called in, what i want to know is should all british police officers carry a gun.
I&#39;d be interested to hear from both British and Americans on this matter as i was wondering would more gunfights occur if police had guns like in America or would the rate of crime actually go down if the British police started using guns?</description>

<p>In the UK it seems like it is very hard to legally own a gun, so a majority of the officers would never have to deal with one. In most cases a taser would be enough to stun in an event the officer is threatened, and when there is a hostage situation you call in the armed response anyway.</p>
<p>Even if you had the money to fully train and outfit every officer, you just wouldn’t need it.</p>

<p>the gun culture in britain is nothing like that in america, in britain when a man, SUSPECTED OF CARRYING A GUN MIND YOU, is shot and killed by the police the whole country is up in arms, adding guns to every day police without adequate funding, time or man power to train every single police officer in its use would mean complete and utter chaos and more police shootings that the (extremely) right wing media over here would be all over[/quote]<br>
+1</p>
<p>I do think they depending on the area they should carry tazers though. Like if you do something bad etc unless they can get a good hold on you to restrain you, you pretty much get away with what you’ve done exl. if it’s something really bad i.e. assault etc. I do think how they should be used should be heavily regulated - I know some/of some bad police officers who break laws which could get them sent to jail who would probably abuse the power.</p>

Your call.</p>
