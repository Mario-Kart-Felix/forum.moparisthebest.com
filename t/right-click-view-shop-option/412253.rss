    <title>Right Click View Shop Option</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/right-click-view-shop-option/412253</link>
    <description>Okay well I&#39;ve just recently added Player Owned Shops to my server, and instead of replacing the &quot;attack&quot; option with &quot;View Shop&quot;, I replaced the &quot;follow&quot; option with &quot;View Shop&quot;.

Now I didn&#39;t really replace it, I just made it so if you are not in a PVP Area, it views the other player&#39;s shop.

For some reason it will not work correctly.

[code]		}
		if(!c.isInPvP()) {
		c.getShops().openPlayerShop((Client)Server.playerHandler.players[c.playerIndex]);
		c.npcIndex = 0;
		c.playerIndex = 0;
		c.followId = 0;[/code]

I made it so when you use &quot;View Shop&quot;, the Follow ID is 0 which makes it stop following. But it still will not open player shops.
Am I suppose to define something for Player Index? Please Help!</description>
