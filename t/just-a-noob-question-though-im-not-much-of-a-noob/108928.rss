Re:just a noob question… though im not much of a noob</p>
<p>hmm are you sure the title is right because this seems really like a noob to me ,<br>
every i repeat EVERY singe player knows skulled = no items and when you normally die u keep the 3 most valuable items ,<br>
when you leave wild the skull remains for 15 minutes so don’t die then you still lose everything…</p>
<p>I don’t get something , why do all noobs go to moparscape? when i was a noob i just looked trough the runescape help pages … helped alot in the beginning later i just didnt care what runescape said… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
[/quote]so your calling me a noob … im level 100 who dident use help pages i did it buy myself u used help pages and why you on moparscape you calling yourself a noob.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ehm try learning proper english before posting , and I was talking to ‘tryed to hack it’,<br>
So whats the point… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>
And level has nothing to do with being a ‘noob’ or not , a level 126 can be a noob , and when you see a lower level he does not have to be a noob , they can be more experienced then you.</p>

              <p>Wow you are a noob, lol nvm we were all noobs once.</p>
<p>When you die you keep the 3 most valued items in ure inventory. So if you have 3 rune plates and 3 addy plates, you will keep the 3 rune plates.</p>
<p>But only for shop prices does this work, e.g. if you had a phat and 3 rune plates, then you would keep the 3 rune plates and not the very valuable phat.</p>
<p>Ofcourse if you are in the wilderness and have been skulled you lose EVERYTHING when you die.</p>
