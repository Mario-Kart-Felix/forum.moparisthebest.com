[size=8pt][i]use the &#39;&#39;Zoom tool&#39;&#39; -&gt; &#39;&#39;actual pixel&#39;&#39; button for more accurate cutting.[/i][/size]

[b]Step 5:[/b]Now we have to covert your image into GreyScale to do this you go to Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;Greyscale. &lt;below&gt;
[img]http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/246/pic5bh0.png[/img]

[b]Step 6:[/b]After GreyScaling and If you haven&#39;t done so [Selected the part you want] here&#39;s how to select the part you want.&lt;below&gt;

After when you selected the part you want, we go to Image-&gt;Adjustment-&gt;Brightness/Contraste.&lt;below&gt;

[size=8pt][i]Crupt your image if you haven&#39;t and go to 
Image-&gt;Adjustment-&gt;Brightness/Contraste.[/i][/size]

[b]Step 7:[/b]Play Around with Brightness/Contraste until you are satisfied with the result. Notice: besure nathing is inside the image you are crupting. inother words the color inside your selected part should be white. make sure we could only see the outline of the object.&lt;below&gt;
[img]http://img91.imageshack.us/img91/6444/pic7gr2.png[/img]
[size=8pt][i]here&#39;s an example of what the Scar Icon should look like after using 
Brightness/Contraste.[/i][/size]

[b]Step 8:[/b]Now we Copy your finish result and open up Paint. i&#39;m sure everyone have it. &lt;below&gt;

[img]http://img91.imageshack.us/img91/9175/pic10endho2.png[/img]
[size=8pt][i]Make Black our background.[/i][/size]

[size=24pt][b]Conclusion[/b][/size]
this should be the finish result of our bitmap mask.
[img]http://img216.imageshack.us/img216/858/samplemi7.png[/img]

Using a bitmap mask is the same thing as using bitmaps except you use the findBitmapMask function. the good thing about bitmap mask is that color isn&#39;t a problem. no matter what the color is. Scar would find it! as long as the shap of the Object dosn&#39;t change. to find this function you could open up scar and press F1 and search for bitmapmask. 

And last but not lease please post comments etc. and please credit Eagertolearn (i&#39;ve spend like 3-4hours making this. :D). thanks.</description>
