              <p>[quote=“ThugLife, post:3, topic:142295”]Well when i was 11 a piece of metal flung into my eye going right through the edge of my pupil (lucky miss :D) but yeah it went to the back and in the back of your eye ball there is this fluid and that was leaking through and i didnt notice for a few weeks and wasnt going to say anything about it but i just mentioned it to mum and she took me to the eye hospital and they said if i leave it i could go completely blind in that eye because the eye needs that fluid that is leaking out.</p>
<p>So they did an operation to stitch the hole on my eyeball shut with these (10) TINY little eye lash type stitches, a few weeks later 2 of them came loose and it hurt, SO bad so my mum took me to the hospital and they told me 2 of them was loose and i had a choice:<br>
Either put me to sleep and take them out (would have to wait at least another 10 hours)<br>
or they take them out while im awake, i chose the second don’t ask me why -.-.</p>
<p>But they had a nurse to old my head in this thing while the surgeon stuck this needle in my eye and pulled these 2 stitches out, and it hurt like fkin hell.</p>
<p>3 weeks later they put me to sleep and taken the remaining 8 out, and i was left with this small white scar just above my pupil for a few months (now its almost 5 - 6 years later all that is left is the top corner of my pupil is stretched up a bit, my vision is a bit blury in that eye and even in normal light i have to close my left eye because my pupil cannot close properly to the sun.</p>
<p>Oh forgot to mention the 4 different types of eye drops that i had to take every 2 hours for months and constant trips to the eye hospital, (i still have to go now 5-6 years on -.-)</p>
<p>Anyway ill try get someone to take a picture of my eye so you can see the pupil (bit stretched in the corner)so you can see.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention cracked my head open, broke all my knuckles on my left hand broke my middle finger on my left hand, broke my right shoulder.</p>
<p>Theres a good few more but meh, can’t be bothered listing.[/quote]<br>
omfg, thug life that got to hert so damn much</p>

<p>Yes that’s not true, but I was making a bagel 5 years ago (5th grade) and I wanted to cut it in half. Unfortunately it was frozen, and I was stupid enough to try and cut it without letting it thaw first. The knife decides to slip onto my finger and goes in pretty deep, like a 1/4 thickness of my finger. Sharp knife waah O.O</p>

<p>I still have 3 scars from surgery once, although they are in my pubic area so I doubt you want to see them <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>Well when i was 11 a piece of metal flung into my eye going right through the edge of my pupil (lucky miss :D) but yeah it went to the back and in the back of your eye ball there is this fluid and that was leaking through and i didnt notice for a few weeks and wasnt going to say anything about it but i just mentioned it to mum and she took me to the eye hospital and they said if i leave it i could go completely blind in that eye because the eye needs that fluid that is leaking out.</p>
<p>So they did an operation to stitch the hole on my eyeball shut with these (10) TINY little eye lash type stitches, a few weeks later 2 of them came loose and it hurt, SO bad so my mum took me to the hospital and they told me 2 of them was loose and i had a choice:<br>
Either put me to sleep and take them out (would have to wait at least another 10 hours)<br>
or they take them out while im awake, i chose the second don’t ask me why -.-.</p>
<p>But they had a nurse to old my head in this thing while the surgeon stuck this needle in my eye and pulled these 2 stitches out, and it hurt like fkin hell.</p>
<p>3 weeks later they put me to sleep and taken the remaining 8 out, and i was left with this small white scar just above my pupil for a few months (now its almost 5 - 6 years later all that is left is the top corner of my pupil is stretched up a bit, my vision is a bit blury in that eye and even in normal light i have to close my left eye because my pupil cannot close properly to the sun.</p>
<p>Oh forgot to mention the 4 different types of eye drops that i had to take every 2 hours for months and constant trips to the eye hospital, (i still have to go now 5-6 years on -.-)</p>
<p>Anyway ill try get someone to take a picture of my eye so you can see the pupil (bit stretched in the corner)so you can see.</p>
<p>Forgot to mention cracked my head open, broke all my knuckles on my left hand broke my middle finger on my left hand, broke my right shoulder.</p>
<p>Theres a good few more but meh, can’t be bothered listing.</p>
