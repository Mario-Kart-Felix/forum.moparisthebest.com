    <description>I AM VERY NEW TO CODING

Ok, on the 508 server I am currently using I have made a new home and need to put the NPC&#39;s that were at the old home to the new one in certain areas.  I&#39;ve tried searching for the coords on a certain NPC at the old home but I am unable to find them.  The thing that I believe that I need is a code to enter to replace another one, here is the section that I found about one NPC I would like to move:

{
p.frames.showChatboxInterface(p, 241);
p.frames.animateInterfaceId(p, 9850, 241, 2);
p.frames.setNPCId(p, 549, 241, 2);
p.frames.setString(p, &quot;Horvik&quot;, 241, 3);
p.frames.setString(p, &quot;I got a ton of armour if you want to buy some.&quot;, 241, 4);
}
if(pnp.npcType == 6537)

To add on, I need to put in 2-3 bank stalls at the new home area.  I have no idea where exactly to put the code for it and I don&#39;t know what the code is.

I would definitely favor some feedback, thanks!</description>
