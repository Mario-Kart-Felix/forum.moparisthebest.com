    <description>I need a hoster that meets the followings requirements:

1. Can host 20/7 +

2. Is online around +5GMT - +11GMT (Other times can be worked out)

3. Will not mess around with the server at all

4. Know how to host no-ip

5. Can follow instructions easily

6. Has atleast 1GB - 2GB RAM

7. Being able to code basically is a plus for when i am MIA

NOTE: The hoster will be hosting one of three worlds.

Obviously the hoster will get equal rights with me anything else needed should be able to be provided

We have about 10,000 registered accounts in - game and has 500 active forums members before it was reset.
