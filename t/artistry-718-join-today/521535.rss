    <description>Artistry718 is a brand new eco server that right now is in very deep need of players. The server itself is very well coded and has been worked on for over 5 months before going publicly. We&#39;ve got over 10.000 items and tons and tons of npc&#39;s, actually so many that it&#39;s gonna blow your mind. There is, in other words, everything that is in the real Runescape since 1 day before EOC, is in our server. Altho we do have items that came out after the EOC on our server.

<p>But seriously, you might want to edit and clean up your post so it seems more visually appealing and more clear about what your server has to offer :).</p>
