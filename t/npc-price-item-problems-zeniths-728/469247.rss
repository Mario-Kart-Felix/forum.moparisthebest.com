    <description>Hey, i got some problems whit some of the Npc&#39;s and i got also some questions, i am just going to put the Npc&#39;s in an list whit the problem on the side of their name to make it easier to understand XD

Jad - Can&#39;t hit through Project from Attack prayer and it also have so low HP that it shouldn&#39;t be allowed to teleport to him and get a Fire Cape. (Wondering on how i can fix so he can hit some through prayer protection like Bandos and such, and also how i can change his HP to high) 

Nomad - He also can&#39;t hit through Prayer protections (melee) and he also Doesn&#39;t drop anything when he dies(How can i fix that he actually drops items and that he can hit through prayer)

Kiln - i don&#39;t know if i&#39;m just an idiot or whatever but it isn&#39;t possible to melee kiln from the position he spawns but you can range/mage him from where you stand is this the way hes coded or should it actually be possible to melee him? (not sure if this is a problem or me just being stupid XP)


Shops - shows wrong prices like shows that it seems like it cost 1GP but actually costs 100K, and some items like dragon defender ain&#39;t on the price list on source folder (Tips?)

Mystery box - this item shows actually that it is going to give an random item that is added in the Item id list bellow the coding (it also says i can add item ids for more random items to get from the box) but instead it gives all the items that are written down on the Item Id list. (Possible to fix this?)

GE - i was also wondering if anyone had a file whit 100% finished GE that you could sell items back into for like half the price you bough it for or something, just need a GE that you can Sell and Buy from (not such a big thing to stress about)</description>
