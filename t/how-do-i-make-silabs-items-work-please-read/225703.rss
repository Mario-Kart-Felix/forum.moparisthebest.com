    <title>How Do I Make Silabs Items Work? Please Read</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-silabs-items-work-please-read/225703</link>
    <description>Hello, i have 2 questions here,
1. I am running a Project Czar Server, I want to be able to spawn silab items with 5 digits, example, bandos boots i believe are ::pickup 15350 1, i can only use 4 digit numbers. Is there a way for me to spawn those items?
2. I was trying some things out, and i changed the item ids in my inventory of my character profile to the silab items that i wanted. aka dragon full bandos chest, boots, things like that.  When i put them on, it puts everything in the weapons holder, also, when i put it in a trade, it says UNEXISTING ID blah blah blah. im guessing that it doesn&#39;t recognize the items? im not sure, but i need some solutions to configure these silab items.

Help would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks,
