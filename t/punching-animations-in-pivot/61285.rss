    <title>Punching animations ( In Pivot )</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/punching-animations-in-pivot/61285</link>
    <description>Frame 1: Load your Floor and stickman. Put your dude in a relaxing stance with the hands on the body and the legs slightly bend.
Like that: [img]http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/7447/pt00ee2.png[/img]

Frame 2: In order to have a semi or powerful punch you must have a charge. Slightly (about 8 pixels) bend your stickman back. Have the front foot to strech and your back to bend. The hands stick to the body of the man so you cannot see them.
Like that: [img]http://img226.imageshack.us/img226/4977/pt01dc8.png[/img]

Frame 3: The most important part in this frame are the hands and the back. The hands now stick out and the right comes up. The back starts to bend more and the legs do the same thing. Bend him more to seem more realistic 
Like that: [img]http://img168.imageshack.us/img168/9067/pt02qc3.png[/img]


Frame 4: Keep bending the back even more. the right hand comes even more up and the left now clearly sticks out of the stickman. The left leg staightens and the right bends moooore.
Like that: [img]http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/7162/pt03ah3.png[/img]

Frame 5: This is a very important frame for the right hand. The right now bends in half and it&#39;s about 95 degrees in respect to the floor. The left gets moved 5 pixels and bends. The legs bend about 2-4 pixels. The back bends 2-4 pixels as well.
Like that: [img]http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/4681/pt04ng2.png[/img]

Frame 6: Now, you bend the back 1 pixel, also the legs get bend 1 pixel. The left hand comes closer to the body. The right hand now touches the head. get ready....
Like that: [img]http://img95.imageshack.us/img95/9196/pt05rf8.png[/img]

Frame 7: This frame is what makes the punch a quick one! The stickman now comes up! He pushes with the bended foot and his whole body goes to the front. His right hand now shouldn&#39;t be seen and the left hand now becomes the right and sticks out of the body. Don&#39;t forget to bend him front.
Like that: [img]http://img117.imageshack.us/img117/9688/pt06lj9.png[/img]

Frame 8:: He now pushes even more and the right hand now becomes the left and straightens. The right gets moved more. The back bends more. The right foot is ready to step forward:
Like that: [img]http://img228.imageshack.us/img228/2784/pt07rr6.png[/img]

Frame 9: The stick moves a little bit and the right foot comes over the left. The back bends slightly to the front. Everything stays the same. 
Like that: [img]http://img176.imageshack.us/img176/1290/pt08eb8.png[/img]

Frame 10: The hands now come down. and the right hand becomes the left and touches the ground. You can pick your own conclusion. I usually like to bend down my stick.
Like that: [img]http://img136.imageshack.us/img136/7651/pt09te3.png[/img]

Frame 11: Now, both legs are on the ground and far apart. The hands keep getting closer to the body and the man keeps bending.
Like that: [img]http://img166.imageshack.us/img166/326/pt10bs3.png[/img]

Frame 12, 13, 14: Here comes the easing. You will ease its part of the stickman seperetely from far too close.
Like that: [img]http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/3680/pt11fe2.png[/img]
and that: [img]http://img147.imageshack.us/img147/6132/pt12cg4.png[/img]
and that: [img]http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/4092/pt13vv7.png[/img]

          <blockquote>
              <p>The animation looks great except I see some flaws…<br>
1)The ground seems to shake as a frame is slightly offset<br>
2)When a person punches why would their leg go forward? Even if that happens it would no go that far forward or the person loses balance. Right now the person seems like he is doing the splits. Try to remove the last to frames to see how it goes.<br>
<img src="http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/4092/pt13vv7.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Other than that it looks like a great animation. After a bit of tweaking it would look better and more realistic.</p>
