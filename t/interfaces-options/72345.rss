    <title>Interfaces &amp; Options</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/interfaces-options/72345</link>
    <description>Before I ask my question, I just want to take a moment to complement this community. I had heard this sites name tossed around several times but never really visited with the exception of when I came to download SRL, and all I have to say is WOW. This community is fabulous, the people here seem genuinely helpful and intelligent, something almost all of the other community&#39;s I&#39;ve been involved in until now have lacked...

That said, let&#39;s get straight to the question.

I own a bug abusing site called &quot;Tainted Ones&quot; which you may or may not have heard of. Recently Jagex has made some undesirable changes to the game which limit the functioning of some of our best bugs. Before I go on to describe the problem in detail I need to emphesize that this has nothing to do with private servers, as far as I know, but rather hacking the official client (just let me know if this isn&#39;t the apropriate section). The problem is that Jagex has made certain interfaces and options inaccessible. An example of this would be the newish equipment interface which you must now access to view equipment stats... previously you were able to drop items while keeping that interface up, however Jagex has recently removed the drop option. I am of the opinion that with either packet editing or something equally foreign to me you could recreate that option, since I don&#39;t think they actually went to the trouble to disable the function of dropping things while interacting with that interface, but only removed the option. Another problem has been areas or interfaces which disable certain critical menus, such as the inventory or equipment screen - most random event areas have an effect like this. 

The only reason I think this may be possible is because of some encounters that I (and most of us) have had with lag, I realize that the effects produced by lag are only client side, however if you will note that if you lag while teleporting from the wildy you will retain your attack option... and when you click it, the option will attempt to function in that you get an error message about not being able to attack people outside of the wildy.

Anyway, so ultimately, my question is this: Does anyone have any idea of how to do this, or even how one would go about trying to do this? Do you think it&#39;s even possible? If it requires some advanced skills I could probably afford to fork over 50m / $100 to have some work done, I would easily be able to make it back with the benefits this produced.

Thank you for any input.

PS - This computer doesn&#39;t have firefox yet, so I&#39;m sure my spelling is terrible :(</description>

<p>I normally swamped with orders for GP (I make all my GP with bug abuse rather than merching mils, so it keeps me busy) so I’m not sure I’ll have enough free time to really get into this, which is unfortunate -but it’s certainly something I’m interested in at least knowing the basics of, who knows, maybe I’ll get good at it, but that is unlikely since programming has never been my strong point. Just somewhat disappointing that I’ll probably never get to utilize this aspect of cheating in conjunction with my bug abuse, I see a lot of potential : /</p>
<p>Once again, I’d like to thank the above posters for the help, I’m looking into those links now, rather interesting. There’s some prominent RS-R members on my site and I’m beginning to regret that I never took much time to look into them.</p>
<p>Anyway, any additional information anyone has is appreciated, but the bulk of my question has probably already been answered.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Unlike the wilderness example, I don’t think there will be any server side limitations on the things I wish to do…</p>
<p>I would also appreciate it if someone told me what methods, specifically, can be used to do this sort of thing. This is all new turf for me, point me at some tutorials and I’ll be happy.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well those kinds of things you would be required to sort out yourself as the method names change every update.</p>
<p>There is a few tutorials which contains some information on menu options. It is mainly action hijacking or action forcing. (Making an autofighter)</p>

<p>I do however suggest that you grab a deob and start renaming some things, finding out how it works. There are some pretty AWSOME pking bugs i know about that can be done via client haxing. So get to know the client, learn some java etc. You will then have more bugs most probaly then you ever imagined ;).</p>
<p>Once you have a good understanding about the client using a deob i suggest you learn about bytecode as deobs will get you banned very fast. Once you know how to implement something via a deob, create the method and convert to bytecode/bcel and create the updater to have it each rs version :).</p>

<p>Unlike the wilderness example, I don’t think there will be any server side limitations on the things I wish to do…</p>
<p>I would also appreciate it if someone told me what methods, specifically, can be used to do this sort of thing. This is all new turf for me, point me at some tutorials and I’ll be happy.</p>

              <p>Certainly it is possible to pull up any menu or any options you desire with a sufficiently edited client (although be aware you would have to recode it about every week, every time that jagex updates the client).</p>
<p>However, like ruler said, it depends on how much server-side checking jagex does, which is in all honesty a lot.  Like you said, you can tell the client to attack someone outside of the wilderness but the server says ‘hey wait, you aren’t in the wilderness, you can’t do that’</p>
<p>So basically you can try and get someone to enable all the hidden/disabled interfaces for you and test them out one by one, but chances are it will be a waste of time.  Good luck. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

To give you an idea how often they update I will link you to the output of a script I have been running for the last month or so:<br>

<p>Well doing actions that are illegal according to the client state are usually banned.</p>
<p>I head of people opening the bank interface while not in a bank, then getting banned.</p>
<p>Many actions are possible, however it depend on the server side code greatly.</p>
<p>If you do find way of doing actions you normally could not then i advise keeping them as private as possible.  Like 3 people max that you know in real life, that want to continue to live.</p>

              <p>Before I ask my question, I just want to take a moment to complement this community. I had heard this sites name tossed around several times but never really visited with the exception of when I came to download SRL, and all I have to say is WOW. This community is fabulous, the people here seem genuinely helpful and intelligent, something almost all of the other community’s I’ve been involved in until now have lacked…</p>
<p>That said, let’s get straight to the question.</p>
<p>I own a bug abusing site called “Tainted Ones” which you may or may not have heard of. Recently Jagex has made some undesirable changes to the game which limit the functioning of some of our best bugs. Before I go on to describe the problem in detail I need to emphesize that this has nothing to do with private servers, as far as I know, but rather hacking the official client (just let me know if this isn’t the apropriate section). The problem is that Jagex has made certain interfaces and options inaccessible. An example of this would be the newish equipment interface which you must now access to view equipment stats… previously you were able to drop items while keeping that interface up, however Jagex has recently removed the drop option. I am of the opinion that with either packet editing or something equally foreign to me you could recreate that option, since I don’t think they actually went to the trouble to disable the function of dropping things while interacting with that interface, but only removed the option. Another problem has been areas or interfaces which disable certain critical menus, such as the inventory or equipment screen - most random event areas have an effect like this.</p>
<p>The only reason I think this may be possible is because of some encounters that I (and most of us) have had with lag, I realize that the effects produced by lag are only client side, however if you will note that if you lag while teleporting from the wildy you will retain your attack option… and when you click it, the option will attempt to function in that you get an error message about not being able to attack people outside of the wildy.</p>
<p>Anyway, so ultimately, my question is this: Does anyone have any idea of how to do this, or even how one would go about trying to do this? Do you think it’s even possible? If it requires some advanced skills I could probably afford to fork over 50m / $100 to have some work done, I would easily be able to make it back with the benefits this produced.</p>
<p>Thank you for any input.</p>
<p>PS - This computer doesn’t have firefox yet, so I’m sure my spelling is terrible <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
