<p>Ok. It just seems like from that angle, if he was standing straight up and looking forward, his eyes would not be looking at the camera.</p>
<p>So this was just a compositing test?[/quote]<br>
Pretty much, i also have a shit camera but it might still work.</p>
<p>But yes its a test, ive been bored of c4d and cant think of anything to do, and composting is always something different <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Im going to do another with a simple sphere to make sure everythings going alright.</p>
<p>And actually a few people believed me when i sent them the picture, and called me a fag for buying it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>quick for shadows:<br>

<p>The problem is the colors are to pure without noise, and i cant really avoid it.</p>
<p>I might just take another picture <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
