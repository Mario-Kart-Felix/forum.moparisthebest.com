    <title>Anyone have ::setnpc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-setnpc/390259</link>
    <description>I need a command (or anything really) that triggers a npc change, i.e. it replaces 1 npc with another,
I was looking at the moparscape 3.2 client, and apparently it has a command for that, but i couldn&#39;t find it.

My attempts at making my own has just resulted in crashes.

So, if anyone has anything which switches 2 npc&#39;s that&#39;d be great 
(If someone has posted one already feel free to post another, it&#39;d be nice to see different ways of doing it)</description>
