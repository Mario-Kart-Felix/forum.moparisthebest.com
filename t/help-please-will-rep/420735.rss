    <description>can anyone help me with a ring that npcs cant attack you only on a certain island and you cant attack npcs so there is an island and you can pk there witch makes it harder to get the good drops the monsters drop please help


so basicallt i want it so npcs are non agressive(only when wereing the ring) and you cant attack npcs but this all only happens on a certain island


this is some help &quot;ravens&quot; did for me but i have no clue how to due that so if anyone can i will rep++
&quot;just make a boolean to find if the player is on the island and wearing the ring. make a void that says if the boolean is true, and he tries to attack an npc it will send him a message saying he cant and he will not be able to. then add the void under &quot;public void process&quot;&quot;

317 delta or pi i can convert most codes</description>

<p>There will be some cases.<br>
Example Kbd:</p>
