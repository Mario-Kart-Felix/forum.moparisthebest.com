    <title>[PI] Not sure</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-not-sure/529860</link>
    <description>Alright, so this has been happening for awhile now, but hasn&#39;t caused any problems till recently.
Whenever a player logs in there is a weird error that comes up in the console.
Here it is:
[code][9/11/13 5:54 AM]: Player Slot 1 slot 0 null Player Hit game.entity.player.Player@5f55b990[/code]

Note: The numbers and letters after &#39;Player@&#39; are always different. (They may repeat over time, but as far as I can tell they are never the same).
Now I have looked all through Player.java at anything having to do with slots and I can&#39;t find anything that would be a problem.
If anybody has seen this problem before or something similar and would know what I need to look for please let me know.
I will be leaving soon for school, so will be awhile before I can reply back to any questions, sorry. 
Thank you for any help.</description>

<p>go to your config file. Just change it from true/false or whatever it is.[/quote]<br>
LOL yeah I asked because it seemed like it would be a bad idea. I guess my hunch was right.<br>
Guess I should learn to read, that would of been the obvious thing for me to do if I did. :fp:<br>
Sorry about that.<br>
And thank you by the way. Sometimes I miss the obvious things.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

Ahh very helpful thank you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I tried searching Google for what the slot part meant, but couldn’t find it.<br>
And just to make sure I am not messing anything up, I would comment out this whole thing right?:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">/*public boolean newPlayerClient(final Player client1) {
		int slot = -1;
		for (int i = 1; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
			if (PlayerHandler.players[i] == null
					|| PlayerHandler.players[i].disconnected) {
				slot = i;
				break;
			}
		}
		if (slot == -1) {
			return false;
		}
		client1.handler = this;
		client1.playerId = slot;
		PlayerHandler.players[slot] = client1;
		PlayerHandler.players[slot].isActive = true;
		PlayerHandler.players[slot].connectedFrom = ((InetSocketAddress) client1
				.getSession().getRemoteAddress()).getAddress().getHostAddress();
