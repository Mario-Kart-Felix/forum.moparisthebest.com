              <p>If you’re running a server, the term ‘Donation’ should almost never be mentioned. Offering rewards (at least big ones) is also a stupid idea. I hate the people that host their server specifically for receiving these payments, which is why I don’t believe the Sponsored Servers spots should even exist. This community is supposed to be the pulse of the RSPS drive, yet we don’t even promote development when all of the traffic tends to just head over to those spots anyway.</p>
<p>If accepting donations, you just need to make the players aware that you do. Maybe offer a new section on the forums, a skillcape or custom item, or something small in-game, but don’t go around every part of the game and make it seem like you’re desperate for money.</p>

<p>True old school pioneering there.</p>
<p>[quote=“Chassy13, post:14, topic:443373”]My main in focus in developing a server is to keep the players entertained. A constant flow of updates is always good. I like to have them play around with new content <span class="bbcode-u">that has never been seen on another server before</span>.</p>
<p>Also as you have said, keeping them happy. If multiple players are complaining about a glitch or a recent update, I will do my best to fix them as fast as possible. If a player has an issue with their account or something in-game, I’ll drop anything I’m working on and will attempt to fix it for them.[/quote]<br>
I think that’s the best attitude to have. If the players know you’d drop your work just to help them out, that would make them feel special. Although, sometimes if you get too friendly they expect it a little too much, not understanding there are others too, and then you have to think of a way to tell them to stop without hurting their trust in you.</p>
<p>I’ve helped manage a well known server in the past, and the owner was really arrogant. He wouldn’t take the time to handle the problems with player’s accounts (as he was the only one who could sort it), and he’d be away for weeks at a time. He expected donations and players, without giving the customer service.</p>
<p>This is what lead me here.</p>

              <p>I agree with you both. I think what makes a server is ultimately the players. And that all depends on how you, the owner, treat the players and handle their requests.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, everything else should just coincide if you earn and maintain the trust of your community.</p>

<p>For instance: constant flow of updates, unique content, concentrating on player issues, etc. etc., whatever you can think of.[/quote]<br>
I can’t focus on one, but these two intertwine I suppose:</p>
<p>Listen to players and their desires<br>

              <p>All aspects are the most important. Think of them as parts of a bridge that uses an arch way. Each arch peace is an aspect of the server.</p>
<p>if you put your cards onto one aspect you will end up failing. Even if you can keep a good player base, you cannot continue if you have no income to sustain it. Say with the income, or updates, you have to be able to find a balance so that you can keep your players happy, but also be able to deliver great content and also great support in all cases that can come up.</p>
