    <title>How to freeze/burn urself with axe (body spray)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-freeze-burn-urself-with-axe-body-spray/21750</link>
    <description>Hey people so today i came out of the shower and i saw a huge moth, and on my desk i saw a fly swatter and axe (body spray) like anyone with commen sence would do, i took the body spray and sprayed it at full power i did it about 10 times and it had the power to keep moving so then just to torture it i didnt do it at full power just enough for me to feel its cold and for me not to see the spray coming out. and in a matter of second it died which came as a shock to me.


So when it died i tried it on my finger and after a few seconds of doing it on my finger my figer froze and a little sheet of white was on it, i wiped it off and it was back to normal (except it burned) so i got really confused and tried it on my balls and it hurt like hell (and was the most effective spot) so umm yea. :D</description>

If you keep spraying on the same spot you will get burn wounds.</p>
<p>On most bodysprays there are warnings too:<br>
(Quote from Adidas bodyspray)<br>
“SOLVENT ABUSE CAN KILL INSTANTLY”</p>
<p>That might look fake, but it isn’t, it could kill you :).</p>
<p>Basicly what a body spray does is:<br>
It makes tiny wounds in the skin tissue, this causes the skin to scar.<br>
This is so that the sweat can’t leave the body, it is forced to keep in the body.<br>
Yes this does means that deospray isn’t the best for you, since sweat is a chemical substance that needs to leave your body.[/quote]</p>

              <p>Hey people so today i came out of the shower and i saw a huge moth, and on my desk i saw a fly swatter and axe (body spray) like anyone with commen sence would do, i took the body spray and sprayed it at full power i did it about 10 times and it had the power to keep moving so then just to torture it i didnt do it at full power just enough for me to feel its cold and for me not to see the spray coming out. and in a matter of second it died which came as a shock to me.</p>
<p>So when it died i tried it on my finger and after a few seconds of doing it on my finger my figer froze and a little sheet of white was on it, i wiped it off and it was back to normal (except it burned) so i got really confused and tried it on my balls and it hurt like hell (and was the most effective spot) so umm yea. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
