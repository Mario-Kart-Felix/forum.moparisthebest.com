    <title>Devoluton V7: A few Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/devoluton-v7-a-few-questions/265678</link>
    <description>Hey, I had some trouble and I need to know how to fix these.

1: I want to add a portal to my server, and i added the object to objects.cfg, but when I add the public int, that looks like this:
[code]         public int makeGlobalObject{};
       
                    makeGlobalObject{2670, 3170, 2156, 10};
    }

  }
break;[/code](Something along that line) I get 100 errors. Please can someone post exactly where to put this (Ex. Put it under Case XX, and make it look like this:)

2: I have a client, hardly edited off another, and I give them 100% for the client, and I have godswords. Now, i made them twohanded, so when you equip them, it unequips your shield. But after that, you can put shield right back on. Please help.

3rd and final: How do I change that when you login, that you don&#39;t get bronze longsword and wooden shield, and if I do change, how do I make so you only get the items once, and not everytime you log in?</description>

              <p>ok, for problem 3: i didn’t find anything. Also for one, when I take out the public int, and just have the object code, the object doesnt show. Is that because of the public int not being there?</p>

<p>I suggest you review your code for problem one.</p>
<p>Problem Three: Usually in the client or Player class. Change the IDs inside there. You would also need to create an integer or boolean that determines if they have already received a starter.</p>
