    <description>Hi there. My name is Devin, I&#39;ve recently finished up my BS in Computer Science and landed an internship at Intel here in Camas, WA.

Before I left the private server community to pursue my degree, I was the owner of the Eclipse servers, revisions 639 through 709. I&#39;m sure information on my previous servers is available via a simple Google search.

I am here today to offer my services, free of charge, to someone who is willing and dedicated to a project worth doing. Not for my own gain, but simply for the fact that at one point in my life, this community was the only thing I had in my life worth counting on. So if your project is looking for a 6th year-experienced content developer or web developer, please post here to bump this thread and serious inquiries please send a personal message.</description>

Wait? Youve done a degree in computer information systems? Seems dodgey to me… Anyone who has completed a degree dont often refer to what level of a degree they have, especially when its only a BA. Second thing that seems off to me is that you took a degree in computer information systems which is mostley hardware related yet youre wanting to persue programming? Another thing that doesnt seem right is that you say, And i quote “I know 95% of allstar source like the back of my hand. Yes, it is ugly lol(the code, not my hand…).”… Well sorry but i call bullshit. After learning Java from JDK 4 it doesnt matter what the build is, the Java code does not change. Therefore if you can code within 317 for example then you can code within a 508. The only thing that changes is the methods on how the server is run. If you only know how to use allstar servers then that indicates to me that you’ve only used Java for a year or so and dont really know how to program. (Just to make something clear, adding a few drops to an NPC or changing the spawn location is not coding.)</p>
<p>Its humorous how many skids are on this site. I know some of you are pretty good java devs but the amount of people that claim theyre 20 or have degrees or worked for NASA is just outstanding. Just remeber the site youre using… This is a RUNESCAPE private server releated forum, a decade old MMORPG thats played by the majority of kids.<br>

<p>I am on my final developments of my server and I can not figure out why the server is not registering IP’s correctly. This in result is creating a problem because I can not fix the issue with multi logging and add the commands ::mute and ::ipmute. Has anyone come across this problem in the past or have any suggestions?</p>

<p>The having a CS degree does not mean you can do something like that. For one it has to do with multi-threaded services and dealing with web-linking and implementing into an unethical existing project. (That is more than likely not documented) Since everything in this community is a throw-together by its members, not everything is done in the most “straight forward” manner. I am a junior in my B of CS and still don’t have any educational experience with multi-threaded projects. (They start next semester)<br>
The purpose of a CS degree mainly shows you have the ability to tackle software challenges to serve a purpose.<br>
The fact is, they could do it - but their “effectiveness” of it would vary based on their experience with the given source.<br>
I know 95% of allstar source like the back of my hand. Yes, it is ugly lol(the code, not my hand…).<br>
