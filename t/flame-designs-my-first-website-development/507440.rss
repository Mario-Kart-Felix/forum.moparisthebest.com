    <title>Flame_Designs | My first website {Development}</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/flame-designs-my-first-website-development/507440</link>
    <description>Hey everyone,
I&#39;m relatively new to this section of the forums, and thought that it would be fun to start learning web development. This site is going to be quite unappealing until I can get the hang of all of this stuff.

I now have a website url for you to view the websites live! Please be patient as I learn how to do cross-platform screen fitting and resolution, but you can view it here: http://www.flame-designs.site90.com/
[u]Things/Languages I will be using:[/u]

[ul][li]html[/li]
[li]php[/li]
[li]css[/li]
[li][size=5pt]hexadecimal color codes[/size][/li]
[li]Whatever draws my attention[/li][/ul]

I suppose I could keep this open source if I wanted to, but my conventions would be so horrid and the code so sloppy and bad that I doubt anyone would want it, or even want to look at it for that matter.
I&#39;ll give an update log of screenshots, things I implemented, things I plan on implementing, and sources of which I got new ideas from.
And yes, I will definitely leech a few things, but not without studying the code first.
This will be purely for fun and learning purposes.

[code=Update Log]
-[3/10/12] I looked at Mod Ruby&#39;s post, &quot;So...you want to make a website?&quot;
-[3/10/12] Website started; I have no knowledge whatsoever of anything to do with website development, except that they are websites.
-[3/10/12] Figured out how to add text in specific spots and how to align them left, right, and centered.
-[3/11/12] Began understanding how to add pages and where to link them to.
-[3/11/12] Added a column dedicated to the pages of the website.
-[3/12/12] Added a contact-me form to the contact page of the website. This involved me using php as well.
-[3/15/13] Learned how to source images in the html
-[3/15/13] Added a column (which is quite ugly) to the left side of the site
-[3/15/13] Moved the pages temporarily under the logo
-[3/15/13] Minor performance/code update to the page referencing and overall site
-[3/15/13] Began looking into socially acceptable programming conventions for web design
-[3/15/13] Learned that it is possible to change the page title on each page. (the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; tidbit)
-[3/15/13] Minor improvements and fixes to the main.css
-[3/15/13] Total layout revamp!
-[3/15/13] We now have a website url!
[/code]
[code=Predicted Updates (Apologies in advance if they sound dumb, unclear, or dumb)]
- Align the pages so that they can be proportional to the rest of the website.
- Come up with some way to make a drop-down menu for sub-pages.
- Make the pages tab go on top of the column/divider
- Fit the website to the entire screen with a decent resolution and theme
[/code]
[code=Pictures]
- http://puu.sh/2gBGl - Home page
- http://puu.sh/2gBGG - About Me page
- http://puu.sh/2gBHo - Contact Me page
- http://puu.sh/2ir47 - Little preview of how I&#39;m attempting to set up the columns.
[/code]
&lt;blockquote&gt;-[url=http://www.freecontactform.com/html_form.php]http://www.freecontactform.com/html_form.php[/url]    - The code I used for the contact form
-[url=http://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/]http://css-tricks.com/text-blocks-over-image/[/url] - The code that taught me how to overlay a color on top of text&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For anyone who will ask why I&#39;ve decided to post updates of minuscule importance into the log - that is because I strongly believe that the small updates are the most important, as those updates are the ones that get you going.
[code=Credits]
-Mod Ruby (for his post on website designing, and giving me tips along the way)
-ox random xi / Andrew (for helping me understand and set up FTP clients)
[/code]
Thanks for reading, give me feedback and Yay/Nay below. :P</description>

I’m most likely going to go with filezilla because of past experience with it.<br>
Just a heads up, this time around,  I’m going to be much more dependent upon tutorials until I am able to toy around with the code. Criticism will be very much appreciated once the code becomes viewable.</p>

Ahh good choice, I’ve been against everything Apple for as far as I can remember, but I love my baby Macbook Air, the touchpad is insanely good.</p>
<p>Judging by that, it’s just a Windows problem, a simple reinstall would fix it.  If not then it’ll be actual HDD related, I’d try running a SMART test before you do anything, download speedfan and it has one included.  Windows does fragment over time and I’ve had a few cases where it gets so bad it’ll just refuse to function anymore.  Seriously look into booting into a live Ubuntu OS though, it’ll take easily under an hour and if you value any of the data on there whatsoever you can retrieve it all in minutes.</p>
