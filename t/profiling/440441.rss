    <description>Nexus S 4G running GummyNex 1.0.2 with default air kernel... I have a few questions.
I&#39;m trying to save battery life as much as possible, and currently I have two configurations, one for pure battery life, the other for performance:
1: Battery Saving - Different launcher w/o widgets, simple usage, generally have mobile data off but sometimes on, 100 mhz min 400 mhz max, wheatley governor
2: Power Usage - Apex, 1400 mhz max 100 min, smartassV2
Is there a way to let me switch this automatically? I know if I were to use setcpu instead of the built in performance I could switch like that, but I&#39;m more interested in a way to change the default launcher based on the profile.</description>

HMM, i haven’t had a chance to try out smart actions<br>
i looked into tasker briefly last night, i’m not sure if that can achieve what i want, but i’ll probably try it out after exams, or maybe one of those alternatives, thanks!<br>
right now i’m thinking i don’t really care about the launcher side though, as that does seem to be impossible to automate</p>
