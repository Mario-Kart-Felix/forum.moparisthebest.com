              <p>The server of New-Era 718/752 is a unique RSPS which has much content an on-spot dueling which is always a advantage, the server has been done so it isn’t pay2win an you have to grind your way up the ranks of being the strongest. The xp rates range from easy to challenging. I recommend this server for what it has accomplished so far an it’s current staff being the best of the best, this server may have a long way to go but I guarantee it will come out to be in the top.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Iron Displee.</p>

              <p>Although New-Era may look like your typical/standard 718, it really isn’t. The server is only just over a month old, but has many unique features to it and more are being added very quickly. New-Era’s player-base is rapidly increasing due to the enjoyment that is given off by the features of the sever. Not only is the server unique, but the community is very friendly in many ways and if you need to know anything, answers will be give instantly. Not only is the community very unique and friendly, but the staff are very friendly active as well. The server is updated often and you will find yourself doing new things often so you will constantly be occupied. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Pretty new to the server, but in a grind my first impressions were; well designed, fluent, thoroughly planned, active staff and development. The community showed it was consistent, nurturing, competitive and encouraging.  The content is rich and immerses you in challenging environment, fair rates, intriguing complexity, and addicting rewards. With a growing player base and increasing constructive feedback New-Era is packed with potential and I’m glad I joined the journey.</p>

              <p>I have been playing this server for about 1 month and a bit now and I must say the community is very friendly and the staff are great at what they do. I see the owner a few times and the developer a bit more so they are around.
