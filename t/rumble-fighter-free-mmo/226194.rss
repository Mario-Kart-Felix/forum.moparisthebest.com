    <title>RUMBLE FIGHTER - Free MMO</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rumble-fighter-free-mmo/226194</link>
    <description>Rumble Fighter is a free MMO that I recently started playing, it&#39;s a really fun game the concept is basically 8 or however many people ( 8 is max) to play Supersmash brothers style fighting games. The characters are all japanese anime but with big heads. What really ticks me off about this game is it has the old 
&quot;Buy good items for IRL money&quot; or &quot;buy useless items with In Game money&quot;. Unless you have ALOT of carrots, like 100,000, you basically look and fight like a bum.
Basically how you make ingame money is just playing and winning fightsl, if you win you usually get around 100 Carrots, a pair of shoes is around 6500 carrots, which takes a very long time to get. The game has basically no ant-cheat system except a report button, I think it would be fun to band together and create some simple cheats for this.
