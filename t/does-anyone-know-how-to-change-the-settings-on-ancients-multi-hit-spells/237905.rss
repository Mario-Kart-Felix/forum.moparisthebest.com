    <description>How can i set multi-targeted spells to only hit a max of 3 players (i would rather have it hit only 1 person instead of all)

also, if anyone has the code for ancient ice attacks to freeze opponent i would be highly gratefull

i have looked for awhile now and i cant seem to find any help on this subject
