    <title>HP Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hp-problems/434457</link>
    <description>I have some problems with my HP where it blinks every time you attack something.
I will post pictures of it.
On the HP orb when you attack a monster it blinks and goes down to like 49 HP and then goes back up to 59.
In the Skill tab when I level HP and attack a monster the first number stays at 59 but the bottom number says at 1.
Can someone help me through TV or explain to me what I need to fix.
EDIT: Sorry for the name of the server I forgot to blank it out. If you want I can re-upload it.</description>
