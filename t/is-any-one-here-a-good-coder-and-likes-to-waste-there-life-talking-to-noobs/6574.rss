    <description>I was wondering if someone could be my java scripting TuTeR so I can make good tuts lol becouse i would really like to know how all the booleans and everything are connected and stuff like what they are etc, also i think this would be better for me to learn first then to learn the other java stuff becouse i already watched twelve java tut movies and im so far behind i can&#39;t understand it so i figure making runescape tuts would be best way to train, what i mean is what the hell does boolean blahblah= flase really mean and how it is connected to everything else and all the other static shit and stuff a great tut on just that would be wonderful.[br][size=1]Posted at: July 27, 2006, 07:31:22 PM[/size][hr]Sending out an SOS.</description>

              <p>Boolean = a variable that can only return two types of information &gt; False or True. Say you wanted to know wether the light was on. you could make (a module?class wtf) that would return a boolean value of yes if light is on or false if light is off. That’s basically a boolean.</p>
