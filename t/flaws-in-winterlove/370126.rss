    <description>[center][size=99pt][b]hello,[/b][/size]
[/center]
By now many people should know why the common winterLove base is bad. Almost every derivative of winterLove is bad due to its flaws (regardless of how important it is). I&#39;ll go through, with details, the flaws of the source.

[anchor=poor_design][size=11pt]Poor design[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]
The original winterLove source was the first RS2 emulator in Java albeit a poorly-written one. Although it was just a proof of concept that it can work, it was never rewritten when it was released. It was continually developed and produced more sources with the same bad design. The key thing about Java was not applied to the source: object-orientation. Bad programming habits from early 2006 are still seen in people today -- yes, that&#39;s 6 years!

[anchor=game_tick][size=11pt]Game ticks[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]
In the standard winterLove derivative, the game ticks every 500ms although it it supposed to do so every 600ms. The correct game tick cycle should happen every 600ms like the real RuneScape. To change this, the [i]cycleTime[/i] constant in the Process class must be changed to 600. However, do note that if you do so, many timers in the server will go haywire. This happens as many of the timers used for a range of things on the server is based on a half-a-second unit. To handle game ticks even more accurately, switch to using nanoseconds instead of milliseconds.

[anchor=commands][size=11pt]Command handling[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]
Let&#39;s face it - commands are usually handled in a huge if-else statement even up to now. The main problem with this is readability and maintainability. New users will have tendencies to be greeted by 100 compiling errors due to not enough or too many braces. Commands should be handled by means of an interface and all the other commands implementing it. They can be managed by any of the [url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/implementations/index.html]implementations of the collection framework[/url]([url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,547606.0.html]t4&#39;s thread[/url] explains it quite well) (say goodbye to a gigantic if-else statement!).

[anchor=process_thread][size=11pt]Process thread[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]
The common derivative of winterLove handles the various [i]process()[/i] methods in a Process class that extends a [url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html][i]Thread[/i][/url]. The preferred alternative is implementing [url=http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html][i]Runnable[/i][/url] to the Process class. Do not make the Process class a subclass of the [i]Thread[/i] unless you want to modify any of the overridden methods. Also, by extending a [i]Thread[/i] that already implements a [i]Runnable[/i], you are indirectly implementing [i]Runnable[/i] to the Process class. Thus, a better choice would be to implement [i]Runnable[/i] directly.

[anchor=process_method][size=11pt]Massive process usage[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]
I believe this is not too huge of a problem due to the availability of event managers released by many individuals. However many sources still may have preposterous amounts of code jammed into the [i]process()[/i] method. For example, the [i]process()[/i] method in the Client class shouldn&#39;t be filled with timers for skills and miscellaneous stuff. It should just handle a player&#39;s death or his idle counter.

[anchor=tpc][size=11pt]1 thread per client[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]
In the standard winterLove-based source, for every connection received by the server, a dedicated thread is instantiated for the client object. That is to say, logically, 100 clients mean 100 threads running. An active thread consume the system&#39;s resources by taking up space in the JVM. Imagine 100 threads running! It will undoubtedly take up a huge amount of space in the JVM and act as a memory hog. Despite the release of Graham&#39;s tutorial on removing the bad thread-per-client feature, there are still many sources with this. I advise you to do the necessary changes to your server.

[anchor=packet_handling][size=11pt]Packet handling and its design[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]
What the server reads is what the client sends. In this case, they&#39;re packets. The typical method of handling packets in the [i]packetProcess()[/i] method is very exploitable. The primary reason is the server not checking the packets. A cheat client can just inject a packet and the server reading it without checking before handling it. The secondary reason is the server not queuing the packet before it is executed. Without this, players can easily spam thousands of packets with a macro. Instead of the huge switch statement, packets should be handled with an array or a hashmap.

If you feel that there is any other flaw in winterLove, feel free to reply to this topic. I shall add it and give appropriate credit. :)</description>

              <p>[center][size=99pt]<span class="bbcode-b">hello,</span>[/size]<br>
[/center]<br>
By now many people should know why the common winterLove base is bad. Almost every derivative of winterLove is bad due to its flaws (regardless of how important it is). I’ll go through, with details, the flaws of the source.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[center][anchor=top]Quick links (least-most important):[/anchor]<br>
{ [iurl=#poor_design]Poor design[/iurl] }<br>
{ [iurl=#game_tick]Game ticks[/iurl] | [iurl=#commands]Command handling[/iurl] }<br>
{ [iurl=#process_thread]Process thread[/iurl] | [iurl=#process_method]Massive process usage[/iurl] }<br>
{ [iurl=#tpc]1 thread per client[/iurl] | [iurl=#packet_handling]Packet handling and its design[/iurl] }<br>
[/center]</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[anchor=poor_design][size=11pt]Poor design[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]<br>
The original winterLove source was the first RS2 emulator in Java albeit a poorly-written one. Although it was just a proof of concept that it can work, it was never rewritten when it was released. It was continually developed and produced more sources with the same bad design. The key thing about Java was not applied to the source: object-orientation. Bad programming habits from early 2006 are still seen in people today – yes, that’s 6 years!</p>
<p>[anchor=game_tick][size=11pt]Game ticks[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]<br>
In the standard winterLove derivative, the game ticks every 500ms although it it supposed to do so every 600ms. The correct game tick cycle should happen every 600ms like the real RuneScape. To change this, the <span class="bbcode-i">cycleTime</span> constant in the Process class must be changed to 600. However, do note that if you do so, many timers in the server will go haywire. This happens as many of the timers used for a range of things on the server is based on a half-a-second unit. To handle game ticks even more accurately, switch to using nanoseconds instead of milliseconds.</p>
<p>[anchor=commands][size=11pt]Command handling[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]<br>
Let’s face it - commands are usually handled in a huge if-else statement even up to now. The main problem with this is readability and maintainability. New users will have tendencies to be greeted by 100 compiling errors due to not enough or too many braces. Commands should be handled by means of an interface and all the other commands implementing it. They can be managed by any of the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/implementations/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">implementations of the collection framework</a>(<a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,547606.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">t4’s thread</a> explains it quite well) (say goodbye to a gigantic if-else statement!).</p>
<p>[anchor=process_thread][size=11pt]Process thread[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]<br>
The common derivative of winterLove handles the various <span class="bbcode-i">process()</span> methods in a Process class that extends a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-i">Thread</span></a>. The preferred alternative is implementing <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-i">Runnable</span></a> to the Process class. Do not make the Process class a subclass of the <span class="bbcode-i">Thread</span> unless you want to modify any of the overridden methods. Also, by extending a <span class="bbcode-i">Thread</span> that already implements a <span class="bbcode-i">Runnable</span>, you are indirectly implementing <span class="bbcode-i">Runnable</span> to the Process class. Thus, a better choice would be to implement <span class="bbcode-i">Runnable</span> directly.</p>
<p>[anchor=process_method][size=11pt]Massive process usage[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]<br>
I believe this is not too huge of a problem due to the availability of event managers released by many individuals. However many sources still may have preposterous amounts of code jammed into the <span class="bbcode-i">process()</span> method. For example, the <span class="bbcode-i">process()</span> method in the Client class shouldn’t be filled with timers for skills and miscellaneous stuff. It should just handle a player’s death or his idle counter.</p>
<p>[anchor=tpc][size=11pt]1 thread per client[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]<br>
In the standard winterLove-based source, for every connection received by the server, a dedicated thread is instantiated for the client object. That is to say, logically, 100 clients mean 100 threads running. An active thread consume the system’s resources by taking up space in the JVM. Imagine 100 threads running! It will undoubtedly take up a huge amount of space in the JVM and act as a memory hog. Despite the release of Graham’s tutorial on removing the bad thread-per-client feature, there are still many sources with this. I advise you to do the necessary changes to your server.</p>
<p>[anchor=packet_handling][size=11pt]Packet handling and its design[/size][/anchor] [size=8pt][iurl=#top](back to top?)[/iurl][/size]<br>
What the server reads is what the client sends. In this case, they’re packets. The typical method of handling packets in the <span class="bbcode-i">packetProcess()</span> method is very exploitable. The primary reason is the server not checking the packets. A cheat client can just inject a packet and the server reading it without checking before handling it. The secondary reason is the server not queuing the packet before it is executed. Without this, players can easily spam thousands of packets with a macro. Instead of the huge switch statement, packets should be handled with an array or a hashmap.</p>

<p>If you feel that there is any other flaw in winterLove, feel free to reply to this topic. I shall add it and give appropriate credit. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
