PERMISSION: [IMG]http://i29.tinypic.com/25t9fft.png[/img]


[b]Note: Some of you may think this is &quot;Deltascape&quot; or based off a source, this was made from a heavily cleaned blank wL with nothing on it, content wise, everything you see was made from scratch over the past year, including its fully asynchronous base with NIO Reactor and frameworking with game engine edits.
Please note the following are ACHEIVEMENTS not goals.[/B]



[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=5][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Our Aims[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]
Here at [B]Dynasty[/B] we will strive to create not only a &#39;Revolutionary&#39; server like the others seen in the Project section, and ones proclaimed around the RuneScape Private Server communities.

[B]WHY?[/B]
We are different. Not &#39;Different&#39; like the other servers say they are, how they have new features, and updates people don&#39;t have, and fun things, but think about it. How hard is that? Im gonna keep this short and sweet and let our features do the talking. 


[U][FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Mini Games[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U]

Mini Games are all Dynasty&#39;s games inside the game, we think that most servers features are all based on people who just start from level 3 - 90 ish (Which on servers dont take very long) so we are making most of our Mini Games playable and enjoyable for ALL levels, so the higher levels who have worked so hard have not only an advantage over the lower levels, But will discover more enjoyment out of it as well as better rewards. BUT that does not mean the lower levels will miss out.

[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Combat Mini Games[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

Here is a list of our Combat Based Mini Games.

- [B]Pest Control[/B] -
* 100% Pest Control, With Waiting Boat, Portals, NPCvNPC, All Pest Control NPCs, Points, Hit Requirements, Stores, XP Rewards. The Works.
[IMG]http://i44.tinypic.com/2zzi6vo.png[/img]

- [B]Duel Arena[/B] - 
*All Rules, Perfect Staking, 1, 5, 10, x (And Removing), Individual Armour Removal, Perfect 317 Duel.

- [B]Duel Tournament[/B] - 
*Signing up with 25k Fee, Teleport to room, Random Pair Up, Winners of each duel carry on, until one man is left, who gets the joined prize. (Must have 6 people to play)

- [B]Capture The Captain[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
* This minigame occupies the old Castle Wars arena, we decided not to make castle wars as you need atleast 4 - 5 per team to make it fun, with capture the captain you can play with 2, or 200, its awesome fun for all, this is how it works.

*Pick a team (Waiting room counter starts once both team have 1 player in each)
*When the game starts all players spawn in the table room in their base, a random captain is chosen
*The captain has a red skull and their Health is boosted to 999, and there damage is doubled.
*The captain has a yellow hint icon on mini map
*The first team to take out the other teams captain wins.
*The first team to 3 points, wins the match.
But beware, captains have [B]DOUBLE DAMAGE[/B] Meaning they have basically 2 hit normal players, but its all part of the fun!

[IMG]http://i32.tinypic.com/femp07.png[/img]

- [B]Fight Pits[/B] - 
*Free for all action at its best, fully working, with rewards, better then any out there.

[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Non Combat Mini Games[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

- [B]Clue Scrolls[/B] - 
*Over 150 Different Adventures to embark on, Thats right [B]150[/B] Different possibilites in Clue Scroll Madness. Only can obtain 1 at a time, levels depending on monsters.


[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=6][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Player Killing (Pking)[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

This is where things get serious and the term &quot;The Next Level Of Revolution&quot; shine most.
Days on end of non stop programming, percision timing, and astounding attention to detail has been hauled into the main feature of this server which is our PKing.

Ok. So all servers say there Pking is the best right? How much its &#39;Improved&#39; and how its &#39;Perfect&#39;
Pssh, yeah just like &#39;DeltaScape&#39;. Its time we got serious on Pking, Alot of people think, Pking is Pking, you hit somebody they hit back, and repeat. but in Dynasty it will unleash an entire new experience for those who do pay attention to the little things. But you have heard this all before right? this bit of text means NOTHING to you. Well let me prove it.


[U][FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=4][COLOR=RoyalBlue]PKing Features[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U]

[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Melee[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

- [B]Perfect Special Attacks.[/B]
* Every Special has been perfectly tuned EXACTLY like RuneScapes, (One thing they did right was their combat)

- [B]Max Hit Formula.[/B] - 
* After searching and researching over 20 commonly uses max hit formulas and studying their minor variables we have found the median of them all to come together with what is thought to be the most accurate damage calculator known to RuneScape servers.

- [B]Timing[/B] - 
* An important key feature in all server is the timing, it can putting it simply &quot;Make or break&quot; a server. With much effort, we have timed every weapon individually to ensure perfect combat timing for all weapons, switching, specials, and combos.

- [B]Bonus[/B] - 
* Due to our &#39;Perfect&#39; Formula and Timing, its obvious the only sensible thing to do was the make our Bonus&#39;s as near RuneScape as possible, except we have tweaked a few for some added hits, defence, and risk when pking, for that adrenaline rush we all love.


[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Range[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

- [B]Projectiles[/B] - 
* One of the most debated and criticized topics in Range is the projectiles, In Dynasty we have PERFECT projectile speed, slope, and hit ratio, if your further away the arrow will go faster, and slope at a different angle, and depending on your range level may just hit your opponent.

- [B]Speed &amp; Specials.[/B] - 
* The Range speed is a very dodgy issue, way off on most servers, but as Range is Dynasty&#39;s creators favorite skill he has perfected each and every detail to the slightest.

- [B]Damage Ratio.[/B] - 
* Much the same to our Melee ratio, after much research we have perfected a Range formula that is better then any known server currently running. 

- [B]Bonus, Defence, Armour.[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
* Due to my Love of range, every item related to range, Attack and Defence wise, has been tweaked to give range the perfect ability, hits and speed all Rangers love. and with the right combos, armor, and skill, you may be able to bring down any meleer :P

[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Magic[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

- [B]Spells[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
* Magic, what do you think? Spells. This is why we have Perfected each and every spell in all our 3 spellbooks, including Modern, Ancient, and Lunar magics (Magiks). All weaking spells, All effects, All graphics, you name it our magic has it.

- [B]Projectiles[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
* Graphics, what makes Magic so epic? The awesome graphics and flying colors that come with it! haha that&#39;s why we have made sure all our graphics, like everything else, is better then any other server seen.

- [B]Requirements[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
* As magic is seen as the weakest skill in the Combat triangle (Melee, Range, Magic) we have spiced it up a bit, Increasing Magic armor bonus&#39;s to hit a little harder, and be a little more effective, only to even up the score for those who wish to be pure mages or use it as a more effective combat tactic.

- [B]Teleports[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
* Due to the large amount of new areas in Dynasty, ALL Teleports will not require runes or levels. just thought id let you know.

[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=6][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Skills[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

Skills. One of the most important features in Dynasty, as it is the Base and heart of our ever growing economy.

In each server researched, the EXP rates for Non-Combat skills were not balanced. In other words, say combat exp was 100X RS speed, some skills were 300X RS speed.

Also, skills were done very poorly/rushed.

Hood has re-done every skill completely from scratch, all experience rates have been set specifically to 10x RS exp rates.

[B]Fishing[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
The fishing in Dynasty is probably the best fishing in any server. There ALL fish, catching multiple fish from one spot (etc. tuna/swordfish). Fishing speed is adjusted due to which fish you are fishing for, and your fishing level! I even took the time to add a monkfish fishing spot.

[B]Cooking[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
This skill (Unlike other servers) Has its burn rate formula more realistic to RS. If you are wearing a cooking cape (100 cooking) and cooking gauntlets, you will rarely burn Manta Rays. Burning is based on mostly cooking level. But we have also endured to make this our first &#39;Full&#39; skill, no skill on ANY server has [B]EVER[/B] had a full skill, with EVERY cookable food, with the exact ingrediants as RuneScape

[B]Woodcutting[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
The woodcutting in Dynasty is awesome, there are all types logs, you can cut trees from any angles, dragon axe works with the correct cut emote. The time it takes to cut a log is based off the tree you are cutting, the axe you are wielding, and your woodcutting level.

[B]Thieving[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
This skill can be a decent money-maker if your into clicking alot. Although there is only NPC pick-pocketing, you need thieving as a requirement for certain quests.

[B]Fletching[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
This skill is, in my opinion, the most helpful. It works exactly like Runescape, including dart fletching, all bows, bowstrings, arrow shafts, all arrows, Dragon Arrows, and Dragon Darts. It proves to be a great money maker.

[B]Crafting[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
This skill is mainly going to provide Dragonhide, but to keep the price of dragonhide from sky-rocketing a few changes have been made. This is the only way to get a fury amulet though and crafting can prove to be a real money maker.

[B]RuneCrafting[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
Runecrafting will be mainly completed through the abyss after the completion of the Rune-Mysteries quest. You still need the respective essence to craft, the rune multiplier table has been tweaked to mesh with the economy.
[B]
Herblore[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
While I was developing this skill, I came to the conclusion that second ingredients were a waste of time. Instead of getting herbs on a vial of water to get an unfinished potion, you get &quot;Unids&quot; from npcs. Unidentified herbs are then Identified and can be used on a vial of water to produce a potion. This is to keep the supply of potions high.

[B]Slayer[/B] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
This skill proves to be also a very good money maker while providing combat rate. I will soon be adding black masks (Affects both Melee AND range max hits) so that players can receive a nice boost in max hit while slaying. Tasks are given out by slayer master, and each task even gives &quot;Slayer Points&quot; which can be used to purchase a black mask OR skip the current task assigned. Monster assigned depends on your slayer level and your combat level. A level 70 with 52 slayer wont be assigned abbysal demons.


[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=6][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Combat In Detail[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

Here is all our combat in detail

[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Basic Combat System[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

The Basic Combat system has been worked on over a long period of time. Every week or so, we actually re-do our max hit formulas because they would be off by two or three. Things like that have been taken care of.

We also took a good long look at timers and delays for weapons. While watching many Runescape PK videos, we came to the conclusion that Runescape has messed up delays, as they are not constant. We have taken the time to develop a combat system that mimics Runescape&#39;s combat system. We have also taken a good long look at combo-ing such as the infamous Blitz-DDS and Range-2h combo. Others such as MSB-Spec to obby maul, darts to dark bow, range - g maul have all been looked at and each work fantastically.

[SPOILER=&quot;Range 2 Gmaul Combo&quot;]

[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=6][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Monsters / Npcs.[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

Several factors make NPCs dull in many servers. As mentioned above, on Dynasty, npcs are clipped and do not twitch/all face south.

Another major problem with NPCs in servers is hitting an npc when it is too far from its original spawn. On OTHER servers, when it gets to the point where its way too far, it just stands there taking the hits.
We did it differently. If you are ranging an npc and you lure it too far away, the npc will retreat, actually walking backwards to try to get you inside its walking range.
We also possess a highly advanced NPCvNPC system. This allows Pest Control to provide the most realistic experience possible. This includes spinners healing portals (Not by attacking the portal *cough*)
Also mentioned above, Large NPCs do not stand on top of eachother and do not have &quot;Connected bodies&quot; as I call them
NPCs also have a combat system very similar to the regular Player vs Player combat system. This makes high leveled NPCs very challenging and just makes fighting an NPC feel right.
Small tidbit of information, I became very bored while making rock-crabs and made them spawn like how they do in Runescape :P
[FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=5][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Boss Monsters[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT]

I decided to re-do all Boss NPCs because I deemed them too easy. It is almost impossible to solo some of these bosses and this is how I want it. The following NPCs are considered &quot;Boss&quot; NPCs and are recommended to be hunted with a team.
[U][FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]King Black Dragon[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
The king black dragon has 6 different attacks.
It is very highly advised to use an anti-dragon shield or dragon fire shield (Fully charged) along with magic protect and an anti-fire potion if your going to melee, an anti-fire potion, and constantly use magic protect if you choose to use a ranging weapon.

Melee attack(2):
1. The king black dragon can attack you with his claws, hitting less than a headbutt.
2. The king black dragon can do a very powerful headbutt.

Mage attack(4):
1. The first attack, is his fire breath. This attack allows the king black to potentially deal extra damage.
2. The second attack of the king black dragon, is a poisonous breath.
3. The third attack of the king black dragon, It&#39;s Ice breath, has the potential to deal moderate damage while freezing you in place
4. The fourth attack, is a stat-lowering breath.

[U][FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Kalphite Queen[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U] - [COLOR=Green]100%[/COLOR]
The kalphite queen is a special boss, as it has the potential to attack everybody around her at once. The Kalphite queen is the strongest boss, as it deals high amounts of damage to everybody close to her in one attack. The kalphite queen has 1 magic attack, 1 ranging attack, and 2 melee attacks.

Melee(2):
1. The kalphite queen can bite a single person, with venomous teeth.
2. The kalphite queen can kick a single person, thus it&#39;s weakest attack with no effects.

Range(1);
1. The kalphite queen ranging attack fling&#39;s spike&#39;s at everybody near the kalphite queen, causing massive damage.

Magic(1):
1. The kalphite queen has a very unique magic spell, which hits one player, causing a chain reaction and forces the spell to hit the next player and so on.

 [U][FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=3][COLOR=RoyalBlue]Create A Stable Server[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U]
This means to create a server that wont disconnect every Hour on an Auto Restarter. and Wont go down randomly for hours at a time. A server that Says &quot;24/7&quot; because it actually means it.


[U][FONT=Book Antiqua][SIZE=6][COLOR=RoyalBlue]The Best. No Questions.[/COLOR][/SIZE][/FONT][/U]
Now when this is said, people assume that they mean &quot;The best server ever seen&quot; no. thats not what i mean, this server is simply a type of server never been made in my opinion, but one that is always looked for. it is a High Quality Pk Server. Just like pures on RuneScape, main type of Pures, Strength pure, Range Pure, Barrows Pure, Zerker Pure, Main types of servers, Adventure Servers, Pk Servers, Now generally Adventure servers are very high quality, with alot of realistic features, and generally, Pk Servers are fast, buggy, glitched up and arn&#39;t stable, the opposite of the Adventure Server, now i hope this server will be the middle. a Pk Server, but that isn&#39;t terribly low quality, with realistic features, stability, isn&#39;t instant levels. The perfect middle, between the two major types. That satisfy all needs.

<p>There aren’t any better communities than Moparscape tbh. It has always been the leading one. Rune Server has always been full of faggots who think they’re better than everyone else; for example, you and Tyler. People aren’t even active on the google and Silabsoft forums.</p>

Thats something id expect you to say, using ints as bases for most of your systems, learn to write real framework, get away from the shitty int declaring and using  == true download an IDE and learn some actual java because ill tell you know theres a hell of a difference between Java and the shit you think you do in servers.<br>

There is actually no difference between Java and ‘the shit we do in servers’. It’s still Java. The difference is how efficient we write our methods to be. You have not proved any of your ‘knowledge’ in Java yet, so stop flaming.[/quote]<br>

              <p>Where have i taken any credit? And why should i not deserve credit, as i said, I am the CO PROGRAMMER. I aswell as Hood and Marty and Jack all program the server. We all work everyday to develop it further. And even though credit IS due towards me, since i am the project manager, should it not be my Job to post things like this?</p>
<p>I understand if its beyond your comprehension as anything outside of deltascape’s fucking networking you don’t understand anything</p>

<p>Cocoa, We are both Co programmars because we both program the server, and im project manager because i organize everything and keep everything on track before i came along the server was un playable. not like your opinion matters, last thing i saw from you was a leeched delta.</p>

</aside>
<p>So you’re the ‘organizer’, not the programmer. You’re just taking the credit for a project in which you have done no work on.</p>
