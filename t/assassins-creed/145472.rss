    <title>Assassins Creed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/assassins-creed/145472</link>
    <description>The past week I have been seeing reviews everywhere for Assassins Creed, so then I decided to search it on youtube. I watched a couple videos and the aspect of the game looks amazing. The graphics are good, the controls, the movement simply looks amazing. I will try to keep you updated on this game with news release date and such. But other than that you can discuss the game here..
Note: Most of this information was taken off the official site

[b]Facts &amp; Info[/b]

[b].::Facts::.[/b]

- The main character&#39;s name is Altaïr, he uses a switchblade hidden in his hand.
Apparently this game follows his story as the most legendary assassin in 1191 AD, during the Third Crusade.

- This game is being developed by the same team that developed Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.

- Although it&#39;s by the same team, it has nothing to do with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. It&#39;s a completely different game.

- This game has been in development since Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was finished. Which means it&#39;s been in development for 4 years now.

- This game was previously known as &#39;Project Assassins&#39;

- This game has been confirmed for the Xbox 360 and PC. This means it will be available on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC. No word yet if there will be a Nintendo Wii version. Source: [url=http://press.ubi.com/fullpost.php?id=101&amp;story=233]Official Ubisoft Press Release[/url] and IGN ([url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/728/728932p1.html] PC article #1[/url] and [url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/729/729414p1.html] PC article #2[/url]).

- This is the first game in a franchise of similar games. Jade Raymond has stated that this game will be part of a trilogy and one of both of the next games will have a futuristic setting.

- The Release Date is unknown. At this stage, we only know that it will be released in the third or fourth Quarter of 2007.

- The developers seem to be going for a &#39;real world feel&#39;, with movement being the main focus (in a crowded city, your character can run bumping into people, automatically pushing people out of the way, stumbling when someone pushes back.) according to the first impressions from the presentation at GDC.

- At this stage, the game uses five buttons and the left control stick. Presuming for Xbox 360, the R trigger accelerates your movement, X is jump, Y is view mode, A is attack, and B is not known. On another console (presuming PS3), the triangle is used to control the head, the square controls the hands with a weapon, the circle controls the hand without a weapon, and the X is the control for the feet. R2 changes the intensity with which you do an action.

- Where the story is concerned, the game begins with the initiation. You&#39;re a novice. And as part of the initiation, your finger is cut off, to give you the switchblade.

- There is no online play. However, there is downloadable content.

- Not every mission ends in murder. You may be required to steal money and give it to the poor, the developers also wanted to go for a &#39;Robin Hood&#39; feel to the game.

- You have to build a reputation with the crowd around you. Each person in the crowd that surrounds you has individual Artificial Intelligence, something not possible without the power of the PlayStation 3.

- Jumping is automatic. Real skill comes in manoeuvring Altair through streets and over rooftops without getting caught or knocked over.

- The Health System is realistic. There is no health bar. You can take more damage easier, so one fatal blow by the enemies sword is just that - fatal. Luckily, an intelligent blocking system helps you out here.

- There is a bit of a science fiction element to the game. According to a demo level played on the Xbox 360, when Altair is fatally hit, the screen goes blank, and the words ‘computer offline’ are seen on the screen.
Other things that can be seen in the screen are: ‘memories /01’, ‘hard drive’, ‘options’, ‘animus’ (Latin for soul/life/spirit), “access your genetic memory” and ‘shut down’.
Also, in the Developer Diary, a silhouette of Jade Raymond is shown against a very &#39;chemistry-ish&#39; background (refer below, the image contrast has been modified as to get a more detailed look). Images courtesy of Wikipedia.

 The idea of Assassin&#39;s Creed came about when the Prince of Persia Team was thinking about the Next Generation Prince of Persia. In the early phases the team decided that it would be better to it to become a separate game instead of making a next gen Prince of Persia game, thus the Assassin&#39;s franchise was born.

- The game is about the people that suffer during the war instead of religious factor as it is being set during the crusades.

- Altair is fairly known soldier, but not too well known as a celebrity would be and he is good, but not the best out there.

- The cities in Assassin&#39;s Creed are based on actual historical texts and drawings from the 3rd Crusade.

- Apparently, Altair has a wife.

- There are three cities to be played in: Acre, Damascus and Jerusalem.

- From what we can see in the gameplay footage, Altair will have 4 weapons. A sword, a crossbow, throwing daggers and his &#39;switchblade&#39; which is hidden under his sleeve.
