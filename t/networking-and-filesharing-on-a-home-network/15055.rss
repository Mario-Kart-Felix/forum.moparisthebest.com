    <title>Networking and Filesharing on a Home Network</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/networking-and-filesharing-on-a-home-network/15055</link>
    <description>Howdy. I uh, hate networking.

So I&#39;ve got two computers. I will refer to the computer that has the internet connection and WinXP Pro sp2 as &quot;this&quot; computer. The computer that has Win 98SE and is linked to this computer through a length of ethernet cable will be reffered to as &quot;other&quot; computer.

So this computer is connected to the internet through a wireless card. I&#39;ve got an rj45(ethernet) cable running between the two. I&#39;m trying to share the two hard drives (able to acces this hard drive from other&#39;s hard drive and vice versa.)

I ran the connection wizard several times, googled keywords, installed new and rolled back drivers, tapped my shoes.... I finally got the internet working on other computer. Fairly sweet I think.

The problem is the file sharing. Windows shows no other users in my WORKGROUP, which is impossible because I can ping this computer from other computer (and vice versa) and I have an internet connection on other computer.

Here&#39;s a diagram that might help for visual people, plus I rambled a bit.
