    <title>Dutch far-right &#39;gain&#39; in EU poll</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dutch-far-right-gain-in-eu-poll/282282</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;A right-wing Dutch lawmaker&#39;s party has made big gains in European Parliament elections, exit polls suggest.

They say Geert Wilders&#39; Freedom Party (PVV) will win four of the 25 Dutch seats in the parliament, just one behind the Christian Democrats.

Dutch and British voters were the first to go to the polls to elect the EU&#39;s most powerful legislative body.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(source: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8084281.stm)

I&#39;m proud to be Dutch! (why is there no pacepalm or suicide emoticon?)

I don&#39;t really like left-wing politicians. I like freedom of speech. I don&#39;t like immigrants that just come here and don&#39;t learn our language and then whine about how they are discriminated when they look for a job. But this guy is a goddamn idiot. Just because he has 4 seats, he wants new national elections. And guess what: according to polls, he&#39;ll win! I mean, we Dutch people are always proud of being a social, progressive people. But then someone like Wilders comes along. The ignorant minority, or shall we say majority (as Wilders is doing quite good in the polls) just agrees with him. Wilders has no clear views on the economy, or anything that really matters. All he wants is allowing the police to shoot young Moroccans in their kneecaps. All he wants is to close the borders. He wants the Koran to be banned (freedom of speech?)

You see, I have nothing against people who stick up for things like freedom of speech. I must admit, that until recently I agreed on most points of Wilders. I still agree on some of his points. But he expects that by not joining a political group in the EU-Parliament, a 4 seat party can seize the existence of the Parliament. By not joining a group, his party can only vote and nothing else. He can&#39;t add anything to the agenda etc...

So, what say you?</description>

<p>I agree that freedom of speech is a great freedom, and one of the most important freedoms. However, Wilders is a hypocrite. He wants freedom of speech, but not for Muslims. I don’t like the Islam, but they shouldn’t be muted.</p>
<p>And the freedom of speech Wilders wants isn’t within reason. He also caused a wave of populism amongst other right wing party’s.</p>

<p>Wilders has two things: he wants freedom of speech, and at the same time he wants to ban the Koran and make it illegal for Imams to spread their word.</p>

First of all, they don’t give other country any chance, either be in EEA/EU or don’t get access to the marked in Europe.</p>
<p>The majority of the countries choose the laws for all the countries this is taking the power away from the voters. Instead of your vote is one of 16.7 million it is one of 487 million. So if there is a law that are not very good for your country you don’t have any choose.</p>
