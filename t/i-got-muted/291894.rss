Appeal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;That is the message I sent to Mod MMG&#39;s clan chat wile I was &quot;pretending&quot; to be Zezima. I do not see how I would be able to sell an account that I do not own nor never will. I think this mute is unjust as I would NEVER be able to sell his/her account. It was purely a joke and I don&#39;t understand how this offense was passed as I do not own the account name Zezima, haven&#39;t and never will come close to logging onto the account Zezima. I understand that I said &quot;sell&quot; and &quot;account&quot; in the same sentience but I wouldn&#39;t be able to break the rule because I am not able nor never will be able to log onto Zezima&#39;s account. I do understand why it would seem like I was going to sell an account. But this is purly a mistake on the CS department for OKing this offense.

&quot;: 	[clan] k so ima sell my zezima account!!! &quot;

- (*hopes this actually gets read instead of a auto message*)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>But still, I wasn’t referring to their enforcement of rules as the problem. I’ve got two p2p accounts, both with at least one maxed stat (one is 126, the other is 105), and I simply cannot get in touch with a real person when I want/need to.</p>

<p>EDIT: But yeah that was pretty much my point. Not babying you != not having customer support. Try not being a dick ingame, then you won’t get muted. Whether TECHNICALLY you broke a rule or not is pretty much irrelevant…</p>
<p>I thought that made a pretty good corollary to this forum, where the moderators constantly take shit for enforcing rules (especially lothy, hence using him as my example :P) and then those same people give us shit for not enforcing the rules, it just depends what serves them personally best at the time.</p>

[/quote]Yo dude this forum fucking sucks. I mean you have completely reasonable rules, and you fucking mute people for breaking them? What kind of fucked up system is that. In my opinion, you should set rules, then when people break them, you shouldn’t punish them. It pisses me off that you guys punish people for clearly breaking the rules, who does that. It’s obvious that every time someone breaks the rules, they’re joking, so that makes it OK. They fucking pay MITB pay cheques by visiting this site and clicking adds, and your going to punish idiots who don’t listen? What is the world coming too?<br>
[/quote]Clearly I cannot fucking sell an account I have. Clearly I block ads. Clearly I was complaining I want to talk to them personally instead of a fucking forum were I have to pay to post, then they only post if they feel like it. Clearly it is fucked up.[/quote]I didn’t mention you selling an account, or the fact that the customer support team is really just a myth. I was just making fun of your arrogannt logic stating that Jagex are the idiots for muting you when you clearly deserve it.</p>

<p>Here’s a translation from what they said to what they really mean:</p>
<p>Thank you for wasting some time sending in your offence appeal - you obviously care about your account. It’s too bad that we don’t, and are therefore sending you this automated message.<br>
Waste some more time reading the rules, because we said you should.</p>
<p>At Jagex we don’t really examine any offences at all. We just tell you this, because we’ve assumed that you’re 12 and won’t be able to differentiate between a completely unpersonalised automatic message template and something that has actually been written by a human.<br>
We are so confident with this approach, in fact, that we don’t even place your account name in the automated messages that we reply with. We’d rather increase the longevity of our computers by minimising SQL transactions to acquire such unimportant details.</p>
<p>We want you, and every other player, to be positively engaged in our community. Please avoid contractions in all future correspondence, they may be filtered!<br>
In short, you may reach a point where we deny you the ability of speaking; push your luck any further and you’ll be fucking b&amp;! <a href="http://www.thebanhammer.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.thebanhammer.com</a> for more details.</p>
<p>What do you do now? Well if we were you we’d play WoW, or just about any other MMORPG on the market. There’s a good chance that you won’t do this though because you’ve invested hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in this game because our experience system is designed to do that to you. That’s right, you’ve been sucked in for life.</p>
<p>Now go and read our rules again, you know you want to. Maybe one day you’ll become a player moderator, where you get to mute people AND remain both anonymous and unaccountable.<br>
Speaking of accountability, don’t you love the transparency in our appeals system? You have no idea which member of staff auto-denied this appeal, and there’s nothing you can do about it.</p>
<p>Have fun - enjoy the community and the game (which is notably fucked in entirety with respect to combat mechanics) - and please don’t spoil the experience of your fellow gamers.</p>

<p>Sure, but those 250 people have to handle thousands of reports each day. It would be almost impossible to be personal on every one, at least, without a larger staff. A larger staff costs more money, money that Jagex has little of and is putting into Funorb and Mechscape.[/quote]</p>
<p>250 people, only thousands. Say each person takes 10, that’s 2,500 appeals.</p>
