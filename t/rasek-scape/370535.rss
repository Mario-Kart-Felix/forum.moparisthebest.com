[size=15pt]Hyperion[/size]
[/center]

[b]Just for proof of development[/b]

[i]READ EVERYTHING BEFORE POSTING[/i]

[hr]

[b]Read this before anything else[/b]
First of all, I don&#39;t want to create a private server for money, or for popularity.  If you&#39;re looking for that, then don&#39;t bother applying.  I simply want to build onto Hyperion from where it is now (this is NOT the same concept of a plan Graham had either!); nothing; scratch; just moving, rendering, login, chat, and multi-player features.  Also, I&#39;m not as stuck-up as I seem right now.  I just don&#39;t want a bunch of little kids applying when they probably can&#39;t even use an IDE correctly, nonetheless program, and another thing.  If your programming skills stretch to only double-clicking a batch file, or using the ctrl-f function, then don&#39;t bother applying.

[b]Requirements:[/b]
[i]Don&#39;t think of these as requirements!  Just what we want you to have -- capable of doing, etc[/i]
[i]Items with a following * are required[/i]

[ul]A microphone (You won&#39;t necessarily need this if you have a good explanation)
Ventrillo
Windows Live Messenger
*Skype
*An FTP client
*The JDK, and an IDE
* COMPETENCE[/ul]


[hr]

[b]Now for the actual introduction.  [/b]
Rasek Scape is primarily a development team, we are not millionaires, all we ask from you (that is if you&#39;re going to apply) is just to be COMPETENT with your programming language of choice, and if you are, welcome to the development team!

[u]Another thing:[/u]  I am not going to &quot;test&quot; you in any sort of way, half of you are probably better than me in programming, some are not, but I am competent with Java, and wish to continue using it.

[u]Another thing:[/u]  [u]I am not going to sit back and watch any of my fellow developers do all of the work.[/u]  I plan to keep building on it until the team has agreed that it is finished.  And then we publicly host the server.  Also, I am not going to make anyone pay for anything.  I am hosting it on a dedicated server or VPS.  The development team will have privileges to use the server as well, along with privileges using the FTP to transfer files to the web server, and obtaining the server files.

[u]And..another thing:[/u]
We don&#39;t care how old you are!  Just please refer to the paragraphs above before applying.  We could care less if you are 9.  We will still respect you.  Also, there is no &quot;owner&quot; rank.  I am not the owner, you are not the owner, we are all developers.
[hr]
[size=18pt]Information[/size]


[b]What we are using[/b]
We will be using Graham&#39;s framework: Hyperion.  I believe it is powerful, stable, organized, and easier to use.  I&#39;m not comparing Hyperion to any other server out there either; keep your comments to yourself.  If the team disagrees with the base of the server, we will have a poll.

[b]Privileges[/b]
[i]I may have mentioned this already..but...[/i]
[u]All development team members will have full privileges.[/u]  I don&#39;t give two shits if the person in the team is just a community manager, or doing scripting;  everyone gets the same privileges as everyone else. (Even me).

[b]What we want[/b]
[i]As you see the bold letters above this line, you may be thinking (oh not this again...)[/i]
By saying &quot;what we want&quot;, we do not mean what we are want the programmers to do in the server.  [b]THERE IS NO LIST[/b].  We are going to do all of this with the power of time.  

[b]We may seem...[/b]
[i]A bit sloppy.[/i]  [i]I mean come on?  No plans?  No to-do list?  Do you guys even have the JDK?  a website? A NAME?[/i]
Yes, yes, and yes...  We may seem a bit unorganized, but that&#39;s the key when you&#39;re doing a project!  You shouldn&#39;t know what the hell you&#39;re going to do next!  Let it come to you!  Because you might never know what you just might think of.  Randomly one of our developers could say &quot;LETS MAKE SOME FUCKING BOATS AND IMPLEMENT THEM AS A MODEL IN THE CLIENT!&quot;  That&#39;s not the best idea!  Nor we will probably use it (we may just be based on voting), but it&#39;s the process of creating.

[b]The Team (so far!)[/b]
Jimmy - Jimmeister1234@hotmail.com
Stream - soundstick@live.com
Smiley - dennisaalbers20@hotmail.com

[b]Positions[/b]
[i]We don&#39;t have any bullshit![/i]
[b]Game Development
Web Development
Community Management[/b]

[b]Position Descriptions[/b]
[u]Game Development[/u] - [i]this includes further development of the game; client&amp;server-sided[/i]
[u]Web Development[/u] - [i]this includes further development of the website[/i]
[u]Community Management[/u] - [i]this includes player support, and forum/community management, in all subjects[/i]

[b]Applications[/b]
[i]You come up with one[/i]

But we will need:
[u]Your name![/u]
[u]Your contact address (email)[/u]
[u]Your Skype name[/u]
[u]Your live messenger email (this can also be the contact address)[/u]

Please don&#39;t apply with the only the items listed above.  Go into depth, tell us who you are, what you&#39;ve done, or anything else.

[size=18pt]And one last thing...[/size]
[b]What we have already[/b]
A .com domain
A forum
Hyperion
and temporary virtual private server (hosted at my house, 4gb RAM, 2 cores)

Experience: Ive been working with XML for several months now, the two scripting languages Ive just recently started but theres nothing to them, really. (Hyperion already has a great JScript engine in it). Ive been programming Java for a little over two years now, and have been playing RuneScape for a longg time. Ive been programming Hyperion and the MITB client for quite a while.<br>
Others: I’m a dedicated worker and I’m pretty active on the computer. I’m not sure what else you would want to know.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Just for proof of development</span><br>

<p><span class="bbcode-i">READ EVERYTHING BEFORE POSTING</span></p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Read this before anything else</span><br>
First of all, I don’t want to create a private server for money, or for popularity.  If you’re looking for that, then don’t bother applying.  I simply want to build onto Hyperion from where it is now (this is NOT the same concept of a plan Graham had either!); nothing; scratch; just moving, rendering, login, chat, and multi-player features.  Also, I’m not as stuck-up as I seem right now.  I just don’t want a bunch of little kids applying when they probably can’t even use an IDE correctly, nonetheless program, and another thing.  If your programming skills stretch to only double-clicking a batch file, or using the ctrl-f function, then don’t bother applying.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Requirements:</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Don’t think of these as requirements!  Just what we want you to have – capable of doing, etc</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Items with a following * are required</span></p>
<p>[ul]A microphone (You won’t necessarily need this if you have a good explanation)<br>
Ventrillo<br>
Windows Live Messenger<br>
*Skype<br>
*An FTP client<br>
*The JDK, and an IDE</p>
<ul>
<li>COMPETENCE[/ul]</li>
</ul>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Now for the actual introduction.  </span><br>
Rasek Scape is primarily a development team, we are not millionaires, all we ask from you (that is if you’re going to apply) is just to be COMPETENT with your programming language of choice, and if you are, welcome to the development team!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Another thing:</span>  I am not going to “test” you in any sort of way, half of you are probably better than me in programming, some are not, but I am competent with Java, and wish to continue using it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Another thing:</span>  <span class="bbcode-u">I am not going to sit back and watch any of my fellow developers do all of the work.</span>  I plan to keep building on it until the team has agreed that it is finished.  And then we publicly host the server.  Also, I am not going to make anyone pay for anything.  I am hosting it on a dedicated server or VPS.  The development team will have privileges to use the server as well, along with privileges using the FTP to transfer files to the web server, and obtaining the server files.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">And…another thing:</span><br>
We don’t care how old you are!  Just please refer to the paragraphs above before applying.  We could care less if you are 9.  We will still respect you.  Also, there is no “owner” rank.  I am not the owner, you are not the owner, we are all developers.<br>
[hr]<br>
[size=18pt]Information[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What we are using</span><br>
We will be using Graham’s framework: Hyperion.  I believe it is powerful, stable, organized, and easier to use.  I’m not comparing Hyperion to any other server out there either; keep your comments to yourself.  If the team disagrees with the base of the server, we will have a poll.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Privileges</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">I may have mentioned this already…but…</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-u">All development team members will have full privileges.</span>  I don’t give two shits if the person in the team is just a community manager, or doing scripting;  everyone gets the same privileges as everyone else. (Even me).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What we want</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">As you see the bold letters above this line, you may be thinking (oh not this again…)</span><br>
By saying “what we want”, we do not mean what we are want the programmers to do in the server.  <span class="bbcode-b">THERE IS NO LIST</span>.  We are going to do all of this with the power of time.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">We may seem…</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">A bit sloppy.</span>  <span class="bbcode-i">I mean come on?  No plans?  No to-do list?  Do you guys even have the JDK?  a website? A NAME?</span><br>
Yes, yes, and yes…  We may seem a bit unorganized, but that’s the key when you’re doing a project!  You shouldn’t know what the hell you’re going to do next!  Let it come to you!  Because you might never know what you just might think of.  Randomly one of our developers could say “LETS MAKE SOME FUCKING BOATS AND IMPLEMENT THEM AS A MODEL IN THE CLIENT!”  That’s not the best idea!  Nor we will probably use it (we may just be based on voting), but it’s the process of creating.</p>
