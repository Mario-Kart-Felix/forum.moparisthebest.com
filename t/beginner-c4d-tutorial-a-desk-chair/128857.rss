    <title>Beginner C4D tutorial - a desk chair</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/beginner-c4d-tutorial-a-desk-chair/128857</link>
    <description>I dont know about you, but I prefer to model interiors and single objects, rather than buildings and bodies. C4D is the main program I use, but I do use 3D Studio Max sometimes. C4D though, because it has some great plug ins. Lets crack on with the tut:

1. Press F3 so you get a right view. 
2. Go to the Spline menu and select a freehand spline, or a linear spline. Whatever you feel comfortable with. I tend to use freehand but I do use linear now and then.

3. Draw out something that, roughly, looks like this:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img523.imageshack.us/img523/378/58255446xu4.jpg[/img][/URL]
It doesn&#39;t have to be exact, but something along those lines would be good. Remember to select the bottom points on each side using the Live Selection Tool. Then, at the bottom, change the &#39;Y Size&#39; to 0 and they will be aligned. #
4. Press F1 to get back in to Perspective view and get out the following:

And arrange them like this:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/2839/86039749gk4.jpg[/img][/URL]

5. You should have some big old splodge. Just resize it to make it thinner and copy and paste it. Separate the two splines and you should have something that looks like this:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img523.imageshack.us/img523/6641/10428994ny5.jpg[/img][/URL]

6. Now, grab a cylinder and resize it so it looks like a long tube. Rotate it on the Z axis and rotate it to 90°. Place it in between the two splines we just created, like this:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img53.imageshack.us/img53/1504/93897166uy0.jpg[/img][/URL]

7. Now our frame has taken shape, we need to add the seat and the back rest. Ill be making this a desk chair just for convenience. To create the seat, grab a cube and change it&#39;s segments to 5/5/5 and resize so it looks something like this:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img115.imageshack.us/img115/6043/26671108td3.jpg[/img][/URL]

8. Now make is editable by pressing C and select the Polygon Tool. Select the front row of polygonal faces. [b]Make sure &#39;Only select visible elements&#39; is UNCHECKED![/b]
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img53.imageshack.us/img53/452/78294511mk2.jpg[/img][/URL]

9. Now pull the face you selected down a bit with the axis tool and then rotate it a bit, so it looks something like this:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img45.imageshack.us/img45/3176/10dl9.jpg[/img][/URL]

10. Place that cube in a HyperNURB.
11. Create a cylinder and shape it in to another tube shape. Duplicate it and put it in these positions:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img45.imageshack.us/img45/792/11ln7.jpg[/img][/URL]

12. Create a new cube, 9/9/9 segments and place it in this position:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img115.imageshack.us/img115/6254/12ae7.jpg[/img][/URL]

13. Now model it, in the same way we did on the last cube, so it looks something like this:
[URL=http://imageshack.us][IMG]http://img45.imageshack.us/img45/6391/13ga2.jpg[/img][/URL]

14. Place that under a HyperNURB and you&#39;re done. Apply textures and lighting and you get a nice looking chair :)

Please note that mr.chris gave me the idea for the chair from his thread. I spoke to him on MSN and just told him that i wasnt ripping it. His turned out a bit better, but I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re using the same textures which are all freely available. I used the same ones he did because I couldn&#39;t think of anything else :P 

Expect more interior and modelling tutorials from me soon.</description>

<p>also, i have a few video tutorials, but i didnt think the majority of the users heer would want a download, so i re-made one with pictures, instead of recording. Easier that way.</p>
<p>remember that to get a good model, it doesn’t have to be a good model <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> a lot of interior models you may see are often just textured extremely well by texture artists.</p>
