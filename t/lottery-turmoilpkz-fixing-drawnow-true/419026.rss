    <title>Lottery [TurmoilPKZ] Fixing Drawnow = true;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lottery-turmoilpkz-fixing-drawnow-true/419026</link>
    <description>Hey everyone,

I recently thought TurmoilPKZ would be a fine source to mess around with though, with the command ::winner, it executes lottery.java&#39;s drawnow boolean to set it to true. Though when I have cash in the lottery array along with the playernames etc, it seems as if the command either will not execute properly or just does not work because of the lottery.java.

Basically what I am saying is ::winner will not draw anything, it does not execute.

This is the lottery.java that the source came with and this is the command it attempts to execute.

[code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;winner&quot;)) {
lottery.drawnow = true;
}[/code]

Any help is appreciated, thank you everyone!</description>
