    <title>Getting 603 animations on a 317?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-603-animations-on-a-317/351644</link>
    <description>Ok, as we know Battlescape is a 317 with all 603 animations and models. I was just wondering how the hell would i do that? I asked if he was loading it on a 603 cache or something but someone said something different but idk... I&#39;m no longer a programmer. 

But i was just wondering how was this possible? You cant just take a 603 model from the CacheExtractor and make some ints that have fail invo/drop model zooms then shit on it... 

And try to be as specific as possible if you know how to and willing to tell me. Don&#39;t go around expecting me to know fucking EVERYTHING.</description>

              <p>Well its defiantly possible, but there’s only a handful of people who could do something like that, and I don’t think they’ll be helping you anytime soon.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
