        <p>Hey there. Thanks for reading, and all.</p>
<p>A few months ago I ran a dodian based server. It was great and all, but it wasn’t being run on my computer. It was run on my friends. He slowly slacked off in bringing it up in the morning and everything, and eventually turned his attention away, and played some game like WOW. Made me sad. I eventually figured out how to portforward, and decided to use that to my advantage, and run the server by myself. I’ve got a client, source, I have JDK, JRE, changed my path and classpath files, portforwarded, and added exceptions to my firewall.</p>
<p>Portforwarding details; 43594, Both TCP and UCP (or wahtever), enabled on (my local ip address)<br>
Firewall; 43594 enabled, Moparscape</p>
<p>(Under USER variables [not system])<br>
Classpath: CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_07\bin;%CLASSPATH%;<br>
Path: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_07\bin;</p>
<p>JDK + JRE (version 6 u7)</p>
<p>Client off of Richscape<br>
Source off of Richscape</p>
<p>Router Brand: Linksys WRT54G v2<br>
uhh…</p>
<p>I’m connected currently with a wireless d-link antennae, and an ethernet running to a switch, running to my router.<br>
My wireless is connected to my network.<br>
I’ve portforwarded both IP’s (Wireless and Ethernet gave me 2 ip’s from the router)</p>
<p>When I run the server, and I try to connect to my NO-IP, it says error connecting.<br>
I have no idea whats wrong. I feel like the most likely thing that may have happened is something wrong with my portforwarding, because I could never get that right.</p>
<p>Thanks to all that answer![br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 11, 2008, 12:58:48 am[/size][hr]My port forwarding[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 11, 2008, 01:05:15 am[/size][hr]<img src="http://i83.photobucket.com/albums/j318/Yeckarb/Forward.jpg" alt width="" height="">[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 11, 2008, 07:51:40 am[/size][hr]no answers…?</p>
