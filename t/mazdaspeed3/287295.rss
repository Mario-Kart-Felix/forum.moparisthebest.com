    <description>I was looking into it, it looks like a pretty solid car. Handles pretty good, and it&#39;s pretty quick. A lot of space and it&#39;s comfortable. Thinking about getting one. Any thoughts?

              <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:13, topic:287295”]When I say japanese cars suck, I am talking from personal experience.  I work on a lot of cars, mine and those owned by others.  Also, I am talking generally, there is always an exception to the rule.  I can tell you that american cars are far easier to work on than japanese cars, a recent example I can think of is a nissan truck I saw once that had the oil filter built inside the engine, my friend owned it and the shop wanted something like $300 to change the oil and oil filter because it was impossible to get to.  I’ve also changed some brake pads on one jap car and thats the last time I will make that mistake, instead of using my trusty C-clamp to push the cylinder back, I had to go rent some fancy ass tool to twist the cylinder at the same time I pushed it back, for no reason at all.  It seems japanese engineers don’t think at all about the people who have to work on these pieces of shit when they make them.  Also the way the engines are designed are horrible, most of them use aluminum heads for example, and even worse a timing belt, so if your timing belt breaks, it will warp your head and force you to rebuild your whole engine.  A good american engine made of cast iron has a timing chain, which not only will pretty much never break, but if it does all you need to fix it is a new timing chain.</p>
<p>As to jap cars lasting longer, that is just ridiculous.  For example, the engine in my 1989 S10 blew two years ago 2 miles from my house coming back from a 4042 mile road trip, but that was at 314,000 miles, which isn’t too shabby if you ask me.  I put in a new motor, and expect to get another 300,000 from it.  My friend back in high school bought a 89 toyota camry with 75,000 miles on it, even though I told him not to, and it lasted him about 2 months before the motor blew.  So from my experience, they are not by a longshot any more durable than american cars.  Also, that is just about the engines, anyone know anyone who has a jap car thats over 30 years old?  I have 2 american cars that are that old, and both of them are in good condition.  American cars go back to the 30s and 40s and many of those original cars are still around, I’d love to see what a honda looks like in 80 years.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, jap cars are not nearly as good as american cars.[/quote]<br>
It took five minutes to change the brakes of my dads 2002 Toyota Previa.</p>

<p>That says more about the driver than the car.</p>
<p>But let’s talk about fuel efficiency. Do you really think that American cars are great, although they can barely do 10km to the liter? There’s a reason the American car industry is falling apart. People no longer want big pieces of scrap metal that can’t do anything else then burn fuel.</p>

<p>Why was I expecting that?</p>
<p>Anyway, lets get back to the point. Is this Mazdaspeed 3 really worth $22,000?</p>
<p>It is said to be a performance enhanced version of the Mazda 3 but what has been enhanced performance wise?</p>
<blockquote>The Mazdaspeed3 features the same turbocharged 2.3-litre DISI MZR I4 engine from the Mazda6 MPS/Mazdaspeed 6. In this application, it produces 263 hp (196 kW) and 280 ft·lbf (380 N·m) when running on 93 octane gasoline ((R+M)/2). This is routed through the front wheels rather than the complex all-wheel drive system found on its big brother (Mazdaspeed6). The Australian market receives the Mazda3 MPS with the same engine as the Mazda6 MPS with 190 kW (255 hp) of power. The engine was listed in the Ward's 10 Best Engines for three years straight.
<p>A GKN limited slip differential is standard, along with a six-speed manual transmission, traction control and Dynamic Stability Control. No automatic transmission option is offered. To limit wheelslip, boost in the first gear will be limited to produce a maximum of 230 hp (170 kW). Boost is also limited in second gear. The amount of boost reduction is determined by the gear selection and steering angle. There is no reduction of boost in gears above second.</p>
<p>It uses the five-door hatchback body of the Mazda3 Sport, though it has extra structural bracing. Volvo-sourced 12.6 in (320 mm) front and 11.0 in (280 mm) rear brake discs hide under 18 in (457 mm) wheels.</p>
<p>Critical reception has been generally very positive, with automotive writers praising the car’s balance of good performance and low cost. The review by <a href="http://Edmunds.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Edmunds.com</a> compared the vehicle favorably to some more expensive rivals, saying “It’s a lot of machine for the money and it offers the same balance of speed, practicality and value we’ve found previously only in the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution or Subaru WRX STI.”</p>
<p>Several road tests have the Mazdaspeed3 attaining 0-60 mph in under six seconds with skidpad numbers in the .87 to .91 range.[clarification needed] In Car and Driver magazine’s May 2007 issue, the Mazdaspeed3 recorded its quickest acceleration times, completing the 0-60 mph sprint in 5.3 seconds, with a quarter mile time of 13.8 at 102 mph (164 km/h). Car and Driver also put the Mazdaspeed3 on their 10 best list for 2007 and 2008.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, this was gathered from Wikipedia. I’m not the expert, I can tell you that but there’s some information for you.</p>

<p>You need to open up. There’s nothing wrong with imports. I hope you have noticed, but the build quality on recent american made vehicles is poor. My mom’s impala is just bad, the interior is half-ass done. Mazda is Ford, so how is it not American made? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Also, how is it bad? I need some facts on it instead of a biased statement. I’ve read reviews, and only thing that is bad, is the slight torque steer.</p>

<p>Japanes cars don’t suck… They’re very reliable!<br>
Even when tunning. Take a Skyline as example with the RB26DETT engine, it can handle up to 800BHP on stock internals… There are even some Skylines with 1000+ BHP on stock internals.<br>
Also the 1JZ (Toyota Supra) engines are proven to be more reliable then RB series…</p>
<p>When it comes to handling Jap cars&gt; USA cars when it comes to tech Jap cars&gt; USA cars<br>
When it comes to weight USA cars &gt; Jap cars and when it comes to MPG Jap cars &gt; USA cars ;)!</p>

until you’ve tried them all you cant comment, besides the NSX is an epic car and will rape most yank cars of the time, mitsubishi evo series, subaru impreza (mk 2, the others sucked dick EDIT: the later mk 1’s were ok actually completely flaked on them) the list of good japanese cars goes on and on sure they make some shit and churn it out like rabbits on viagra but you cant base eveyrthing they make on that</p>
