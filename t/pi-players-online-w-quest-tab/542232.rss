    <description>Okay, I understand this has been done before, a million times in fact.
But I still run into topics [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,661056.0.html]like this[/url] where it seems the person (no offence to user portugalrox) may not understand the other tutorials, or just java in its entirety so they have trouble adding it. I believe I gave a fair enough explanation within the code on how it works. Please give feedback on both the code itself, and my comments explaining it (I did not use totally proper conventions on the comments, sorry).

Okay first you&#39;re going to add this array of ints in just about any file (the only time this int would be modified is if you got a new quest interface, the game itself will not modify them, so it&#39;s safe to say it could be treated as a constant if you wanted). I have added it into Player.java and in order to reduce the chance of receiving errors, you should place it in the same file, or Client.java (either will work in this scenario). Make sure not to place it within another method. If you&#39;re having a hard time adding it still, open Player.java and search &quot;public int playerRights&quot;. Then add a new line, and past the array onto that new line.

[code=java]        public int[] questbkIds = { 8145, 8147, 8148, 8149, 8150, 8151, 8152,
                        8153, 8154, 8155, 8156, 8157, 8158, 8159, 8160, 8161, 8162, 8163,
                        8164, 8165, 8166, 8167, 8168, 8169, 8170, 8171, 8172, 8173, 8174,
                        8175, 8176, 8177, 8178, 8179, 8180, 8181, 8182, 8183, 8184, 8185,
                        8186, 8187, 8188, 8189, 8190, 8191, 8192, 8193, 8194, 8195, 12174,
                        12175, 12176, 12177, 12178, 12179, 12180, 12181, 12182, 12183,
                        12184, 12185, 12186, 12187, 12188, 12189, 12190, 12191, 12192,
                        12193, 12194, 12195, 12196, 12197, 12198, 12199, 12200, 12201,
                        12202, 12203, 12204, 12205, 12206, 12207, 12208, 12209, 12210,
                        12211, 12212, 12213, 12214, 12215, 12216, 12217, 12218, 12219,
                        12220, 12221, 12222, 12223 };[/code]
This should be all the ID&#39;s for all the lines within the quest interface. It doesn&#39;t contain the title id (8144).

Add these to PlayerAssistant.java
[code=java]/* 
 * This will clear all the ids for the quest interface
 * The reason we do this is because if a player has recently
 * logged off and they were the most recent to login, their name
 * wouldn&#39;t have been cleared from the interface if no one else
 * had logged in between then.
 */
public void clearQBook() {
	c.getPA().questbkIds(&quot;&quot;, 8144);// interface title - not in the array so it&#39;s cleared before the loop.
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; c.questbkIds.length; i++) {
		c.getPA().questbkIds(&quot;&quot;, c.questbkIds[i]);
	}
}

/* 
 * This is the method that will show our interface.
 * It first clears the quest ids using the method we
 * created before. Next it loops through all the online
 * players (Thanks to the PlayerHandler) and adds
 * each name to a respected line of the interface.
 * After all players have been added, it will finally
 * display the interface.
 */
public void playersOnline() {
	int line = c.questbkIds[0];// The line in which we start on the interface
	c.clearQbook();// Clearing the interface
	c.getPA().questbkIds(PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount() + &quot; Players Online&quot;, 8144);//Sets interface title to &quot;X players online&quot;
	/*
	 * I used a try-catch just in case somehow something went wrong while building
	 * the interface the player wouldn&#39;t randomly disconnect because of the error.
	*/
	try {
		for (Player client : PlayerHandler.players) {// Looping through all online players
			/* Last line of the 8100&#39;s time to jump to the 12100&#39;s */
			if(line == 8196)
				line = 12174;
			/* This line (for some reason) isn&#39;t on the quest interface, so we skip it. */
			if(line == 8146)
				line++;
			/* The last line on the interface. If we exceed it, break (stop) the loop. */
			if(line &gt; 12223)
				break;
			/* This casts the Player object to a Client object. */
			Client c2 = (Client) client;
			if(c2 != null){// Making sure the client object isn&#39;t null
				c.getPA().sendFrame126(Misc.optimizeText(c2.playerName), line);
				line++;
			}
		}
	} catch (Exception e) {
		/*
		 * You could put a message to the user (c.sendMessage)
		 * saying that the interface for some reason didn&#39;t build
		 * correctly here. I didn&#39;t include a stack trace for the
		 * exception because no one would see it any ways. :)
		 */
	}
	/*
	 * After everything is good and built, we finally send the interface
	 * The reason we waited to send the interface till after all the names
	 * were added is so they player would only see the final output.
	 * If this was added to the loop, it&#39;d flash each time a new player
	 * was added on the interface. If it was called before the loop,
	 * you should see each player get added to the interface one by one.
	 */
	c.getPA().showInterface(8134);
}
[/code]

Now your command (Commands.java)
[code=java]if(playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;players&quot;))
     c.getPA().playersOnline();[/code]</description>

That was a joke lol.<br>
I used the array because it’s easier to call in other methods and such instead of making a loop and doing what I did above, over and over (I did it above because I totally spaced it had a missing number, I will probably redo a couple parts).<br>
For instance, if I were actually using it for a quest book and it was set up like:<br>
(bad example wrote in the reply box)</p>
<p><code>
//id would be to keep track of each individual quest, not the id of the frame.
public void sendQuest(int id, String... line) {
     for(int i = 0; i &lt; c.questbkIds; i++) {
          c.getPA().sendFrame126((i &lt;= line.length - 1 ? line[i] : ""), c.questbkIds[i]);
     }
}</code></p>

<p>Because you use the quest interface for a multiple of things (or I would assume). That including other quests.<br>
So even if you do clear it the first time the player initializes the client, it could still have text from it being used elsewhere.</p>
<p>I guess you could loop through all the id’s on the interface and add the name to each line, and if there were no more active players it’d just add a blank space. But it’s still basically the same thing.[/quote]</p>

</aside>
<p>Because you use the quest interface for a multiple of things (or I would assume). That including other quests.<br>
So even if you do clear it the first time the player initializes the client, it could still have text from it being used elsewhere.</p>
<p>I guess you could loop through all the id’s on the interface and add the name to each line, and if there were no more active players it’d just add a blank space. But it’s still basically the same thing.</p>

After all, it's for people who don't know anything
<p>I don’t know whether this is a better way of doing it in terms of performance or whatever, but the array isn’t really needed.</p>

<p>The commenting is OTT, you don’t need to explain every letter and why you’ve chosen the letter.</p>
<p>Conventions need work</p>
<p>Other than that nice, gonna help some beginners. You can’t find much like this these days.</p>

I have added it into Player.java and in order to reduce the chance of receiving errors, you should place it in the same file, or Client.java (either will work in this scenario). Make sure not to place it within another method. If you’re having a hard time adding it still, open Player.java and search “public int playerRights”. Then add a new line, and past the array onto that new line.</p>
