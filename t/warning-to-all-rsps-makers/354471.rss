    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/warning-to-all-rsps-makers/354471</link>
    <description>Well i know this is in the wrong section But is the most one viewed Basicly in the last 4week&#39;s i have noticed Jagex is cracking down on rsps And rs bot&#39;s. i also have my email address in the pic for proof

I&#39;m not trying to scare any one As we have all had ow in counters with jagex before but i got pummel buy loosing my rights to host a p server i can no longer do it as i&#39;m being watched now.

this is basic a heads up on what may be to come. here are my pic&#39;s off Jagex kicking my ass. 

First off my you tube Account. yes this is mine i can still use it but wish not you can message me or w/e for proof.

As i did have the most popular Rsps set up to tutorial on you tube with 108000 views.

RS BOT Shut down 3 Weeks ago http://rsbot.org/

And a few other pics i have CBF uploading them. 

But this is mainly a heads up a for forums boards such as moparscape.
im not sure if they have put a team together or some shit but they got me And im not even well known so bigger sites like r sev an mopa maybe hit. if this post is not locked i will be trying to get more info to help this community to avoid Jagex.</description>
