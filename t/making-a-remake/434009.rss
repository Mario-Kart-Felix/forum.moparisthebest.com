    <title>Making A Remake</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-remake/434009</link>
    <description>Hey Guys,

I was thinking about making a 2006 remake. Now I know what you all are thinking &quot;LOL another remake&quot; But I want to challenge myself, and support from the Mopar community would be amazing. Now I had a question: Delta is the best way to go correct? If anyone could link me to a good Source + Client for starting this please PM me or leave it in a comment. With that said I would also like you all to leave suggestions for the remake, things you would like to see added that you haven&#39;t seen anywhere else. Or just any thoughts that come to mind. Thanks Guys!

PS: I Wasn&#39;t Sure Where To Put This, Please Move If It Is In The Wrong Section.</description>

<p>A remake with Delta? It’s the programmer that matters, not his/her source.</p>
