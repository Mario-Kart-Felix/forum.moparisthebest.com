    <title>Severe calf cramp or ligament damage?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/severe-calf-cramp-or-ligament-damage/337123</link>
    <description>Seeing as it&#39;s 1am where I live, I couldn&#39;t be bothered to go to the doctors at this very instant. Just curious because I know a few of you are fitness freaks, but how does one tell a cramp from ligament damage?

Today while playing rugby I landed on both of my legs very awkwardly and they both gave out from underneath me when I rolled away from the tackle, and I fell flat on my face - only to notice that my ankles were basically pointing &lt; &gt; and I was in extreme agony in my calf muscles on both legs that no matter what I did nothing elevatiating the pain.. I had it massaged and stretched, but yet to no avail and it still hurts an intense pain when I tense that muscle a little.

By the way, I&#39;ve had calf cramps before (not often, but every now and then I get them while training), but none were this extreme. I have a fairly good tolerance when it comes to pain (by that I mean, I&#39;m no stranger to broken bones or injuries).. but this was not a cramp like pain, this was more the feeling of complete shatter of a muscle. When the first aid officer rolled down my socks he told me he began to worry because my muscle wasn&#39;t in a spasm like it would in a cramp.

I&#39;m thinking it could still be cramped up a little (well, I&#39;m hoping atleast). However I&#39;m beginning to think otherwise.</description>

              <p>Sounds fucking nasty. Given the level of pain you’ve described, I’d play it safe and visit a doctor regardless of what anyone tells you here.<br>
ALSO, I don’t understand why a picture of me was dragged into this. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

It wasn’t really ‘landing’ per-say… One of their Props ran the ball up the ruck and I tackled him head on and began driving him back (it was a fucking dominate tackle to say the least), however when I lifted him up I felt excruciating pain in both calves, and then when I landed on top of him and rolled away was when I realized I’d done the damage.</p>
<p>I’m going to get it assessed tomorrow because it still hasn’t gotten any better, and the muscle is still tender as fuck.</p>
