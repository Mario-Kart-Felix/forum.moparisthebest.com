Zaypay Mobile Payment method integration.


C1. Introduction

Hello and welcome to our mobile payment tutorial. I know the summer is coming up, which means big business for everyone. My job here is to contribute to the community that has helped me a lot on my way up. So here is my present in return for the community that helped me. A full tutorial on integrating zaypay in your systems. Zaypay has increased revenue with at least 50% for a lot of businesses. Their support focusses especially on our type of business. They have started a campaign especially to target online games like RSPS; because, let&#39;s face it; mobile payments are the way to go nowadays. Every teenager has a mobile phone, every house has a phone and it is extremely quick and easy to make mobile payments.

Zaypay is a quick and easy to set up system. Private Servers are perfectly suitable for their system. Soulsplit&#39;s chargeback rate is currently under 0,1% and our revenue was boosted with at least 50% - Quoted from their register page at [url=http://zaypay.com/create_account]http://zaypay.com/create_account[/url]



C1.- Creating a zaypay account:
Please click here to sign up. (Link will open [url=http://zaypay.com/create_account]http://zaypay.com/create_account[/url]).

C2. – Verifying your e-mail:
Please visit the inbox for the email you have entered in the registration form. You will see a link that you need to press to verify your email.

C3. – Notification:
From now on you are a real zaypay user! Feel free to open up support tickets and I&#39;m sure they will be able to help you out.

C4. – Logging in:
On the top right there is a login form. Please enter your registered username and password in this form. If you forgot your password simply click the link on the left side of the form that states “forgotten password”. This link comes available after one bad login request.


C5.– Defining your site:
For RSPS I would choose the mobile or casual gaming tag. After your site has been approved you will be able to receive payments. You can proceed with the other steps while your account is being approved.

C6.- Creating a price setting.

Visit [url=http://zaypay.com/pay_configs/new]Mobile Payments | SMS Micropayments | Pay by Phone | Zaypay[/url]

Put your configuration exactly as mine and modify the text that needs modification. Note that the price setting will allow payments from anything above the given amount.

C7.– Creating a payalogue

The payalogue is the box that will automatically display on your website when you click the payment button. Here is the good configuration for it.

C8. - Placing the button

We have created a button for you that automatically requires the username of the user with a textfield and then starts the request to the IPN from this person. Please visit the /scripts folder in the download file.


C9. - The IPN Script.

Zaypay allows for a very easy IPN script. It&#39;s only a few lines long and works perfectly fine.
You can find the script in the documents you had to download in /scripts called ipnscript.php – Please upload this script to your main folder in your website ([url=http://yourwebsite.com/ipnscript.php]http://yourwebsite.com/ipnscript.php[/url]), or another folder if you have set that as a setting in the zaypay pagalogue.

* Please initialize a database connection on the place that we have put the commented out database connection code. If you wish to use our code please uncomment it out and fill in the corrent details


C10. - Test payments

Please visit [url=http://zaypay.com]Mobile Payments | SMS Micropayments | Pay by Phone | Zaypay[/url] and type “test payments” in the help bar to see how to do those.



CONGRATULATIONS! NOW JUST WAIT FOR YOUR SITE TO VERIFY AND YOU CAN START SELLING!</description>
