    <description>Hey, can anyone tell me how I can change the IP and Port the client is connecting by? I&#39;m running 508, and EGUI.java has 0.0.0.0 for all 3 fields, and right now I don&#39;t have anyone to test it with, but anyways I&#39;m planning to host 3 servers on my router, so I&#39;m going to have to use 3 ports, and I&#39;m making an app with vb to change it with 1 click, the problem being, I don&#39;t know what to change exactly. Thanks, DJ.

/Never mind, sorry :P</description>
