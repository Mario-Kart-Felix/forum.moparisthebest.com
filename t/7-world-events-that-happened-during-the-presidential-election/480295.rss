    <title>7 World Events that Happened During The Presidential Election?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/7-world-events-that-happened-during-the-presidential-election/480295</link>
    <description>Hi all, so I have this big election project, and the last part was to create a timeline. Here is the instructions.
Create a timeline of 7 key events that occurred in the United States or World that affect our country during this time period. No summary is needed.
So I have Benghazi, Sandy Hurricane, and Newtown shooting. I was wondering what you all thought would be key events. I only need 7 and I have a few more ideas, I just wanted another opinion and a few other ideas. The time period is September-Inauguration Day:January 20th.</description>

              <p>It doesn’t have to be world events, but there should be a few, not all to the U.S. I actually finished and came up with:<br>
-Sept. 11-Benghazi attack<br>
-Oct. 5- U.S unemployment drops to lowest point since 2009<br>
-Oct. 29-Hurricane Sandy makes landfall in NJ<br>
-Nov. 4-Pres. Obama is re-elected<br>
-Nov. 9- Petraeus resigns as CIA Director<br>
-Dec. 14-Gunman kills 26 at elementary school<br>
-Jan. 16-At least 41 Engineers are held hostage in Algeria<br>
What do you think? If you guys think there are other events I would still love to hear about them! Thanks!</p>
