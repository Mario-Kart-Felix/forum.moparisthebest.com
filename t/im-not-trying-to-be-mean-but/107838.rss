    <title>Im not trying to be mean, but</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-not-trying-to-be-mean-but/107838</link>
    <description>I&#39;m seeing a lot of people posting here that are completely clueless with Java. I don&#39;t mean like bugs with your server. I mean some of you don&#39;t even know what a compiler is and that&#39;s sad. Please learn the Java basics [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,134771.0.html]HERE[/url] and then ask questions. I&#39;m sick of helping people that don&#39;t know anything about Java.

This will be probably get locked and I&#39;ll get warned (I hope not) but please just do it.</description>

              <p>I like helping people, though. And I don’t mind if their problems are dumb… but some people even ask “HOW DO I MAKE A SERVER!!!” If they actually read rules before they posted they would know to search before asking. There are over 20 tutorials on that.</p>
