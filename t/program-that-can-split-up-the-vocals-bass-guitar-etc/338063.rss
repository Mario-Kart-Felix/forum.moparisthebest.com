    <title>Program that can split up the vocals, bass, guitar, etc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/program-that-can-split-up-the-vocals-bass-guitar-etc/338063</link>
    <description>Does anyone know of a program that when you import a song into it, it&#39;ll divide up the song by the vocals, bass, guitar, and drums so I can just like turn off the drums if I wanted to or turn off the vocals? I want this so I can turn the guitar part off and play to the song on guitar.</description>
