    <title>Minecraft - All you need to know!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-all-you-need-to-know/450377</link>
    <description>I wrote one of these when the Moparcraft forums first started quite a bit ago now, some of the information was partially incorrect and the guide gave the community quite a lot of google views and a good google ranking for an important question. I&#39;m rewriting it all and adding multiple extensions to further better its use. Without further delay, let us begin: (Please bear in mind it&#39;s not fully complete yet, handling it was becoming difficult because of how long it is so I decided to post it and continue working on it).

[size=18pt]A brief introduction to Minecraft (What is it, who made it, and so on!)[/size]
[anchor=giintroduction]

Minecraft is a sandbox game, there are literally no limits to what you can do on Minecraft. The world expands as you explore and the chances of you running out of space are virtually non-existent. In Minecraft there is no set Map like on most games, each world you make is randomly generated meaning no two maps are ever going to be the same. This allows for a unique and challenging experience each time you play the game, even if you&#39;ve played for years no object will be found in the same place. 

One of the main objectives of Minecraft for most people is to build a house, this can be done by using the hundreds of unique blocks which are ingame from wood to ice Minecraft truly does have it all making it a great hit among creative enthusiasts, at the same time Minecraft is also popular for its PVP aspect it offers an intense experience for those who wish to go head to head in the battlefield, for that, Minecraft offers bows, sword, explosives and multiple ways to create traps and fortresses to enhance the fight. From dragon fights to Jedi temple remakes, there really is no limit to what you can do in Minecraft. 

Minecraft was created by a man called Notch, his real name is Markus Persson. He developed Minecraft in the early stages of the game single handedly as an indie game developer. Once Minecraft started to become popular he got an office and recruited other members which ultimately today form Mojang. This includes Jeb who now works on the game full time as the lead developer, you can find their social media links below:

[size=18pt]How far has Minecraft come since its initial release?[/size]
[anchor=giinitrelease]
Minecraft has sold over 6 million copies, thats a hell of a lot for just a small team of developers. It went from PC to Xbox360 this year topping to charts there as well. I would write out about how far Minecraft has come but a brilliant documentary was made of Mojang not so long ago. You can watch it yourself:

[size=18pt]Where is Minecraft heading?[/size]
[anchor=giheading]
Minecraft is now officially released, from what started of with a game without a day and night cycle with missing core elements in Alpha it has certainly gone far, and shows no signs of stopping yet. [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history]Check out the past/future updates[/url] 1.3 promises even more interesting content.

[size=18pt]Playing Minecraft (Playing for free, and troubleshooting)[/size]
[anchor=spplaying]
Many people chose to download a cracked Minecraft version simply because they don&#39;t have the money to pay for actual Minecraft, other do it because they want to try out the game before paying the money for it. This is understandable, though I&#39;d like to suggest if you ever find the money that [url=http://www.minecraft.net/store]you should purchase Minecraft from their website.[/url]

Anyhow, moving on, to play Minecraft for free you want to download a cracked client. There are multiple versions released, here are a few downloads:

[url=http://www.mediafire.com/?6988po8yw5us8sw].EXE version[/url] - by Lilxcj
[url=http://uppit.com/ekpzpqtnv84z/minecraft.jar].JAR version[/url] - by CoonHunter

Once you&#39;ve downloaded the file you simply execute it and then play, it is pretty self explanatory. Be warned though, some servers have cracked clients disabled meaning you cannot play unless you buy the game. You may struggle to find a server which allows cracked clients, [url=http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,550652.0.html]though I do reccomend the community server where we do allow cracked clients.[/url]

Sometimes the client may fail to start all I can recommend is that you try both JAR/EXE to see which one suits you the most. Aside from that please ensure you have all the required installations such as Java.

[size=18pt]An introduction to the game (Surviving your first night)[/size]
[anchor=spintro]
Minecraft survival can seem like a daunting place, with creatures hunting you at night that is. Not to fear, after this section you&#39;ll be well equipped with knowledge on how to keep these monsters away, and survive, until the day! We all learn differently so I&#39;ll provide what I feel is a good video made by [url=http://www.youtube.com/user/paulsoaresjr]paulsoaresjr[/url]:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B36Ehzf2cxE

As a generally quick text representation, you want to just aim to survive on your first night, don&#39;t go building a city or anything. The first night is about the core element of the game: Survival. You want to find [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Coal_Orer]coal[/url] to produce [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Torch]torches[/url] which you can then use to light up your area, torches produce light which in turn stop mobs from spawning thus protecting you through the night. What you want to build your starter house of is entirely up to you, though I&#39;d strongly not suggest anything too technical at such an early stage in the game. I&#39;m a strong believer in establishing a base of operations and then expanding it as you progress in the game. It is also important that you know who the monsters are, and what they can do:

[size=14pt]The Zombie[/size]

A classical hit among gamers, and movie lovers, where would the world be right now without the old Zombie. Minecraft also has this trend too, Zombies spawn in dark areas (such as caves, or at night time). They&#39;re easy to spot, they burn in natural sun light so if you&#39;re even being chased in a cave and can&#39;t win, go to the sun and they will burn alive.

[url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Zombie]Check out this picture of a Zombie here along with more detailed information.[/url]

[size=14pt]The Skeleton[/size]

Or known as, the Skeletal Archer. These guys are what they&#39;re called: Skeletons. They come with a bow and unlimited arrows and are sharpshooters. Even the guys from the Matrix would struggle to dodge these shots! 

[url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Skeleton]Check out this picture of a Skeleton here along with more detailed information.[/url]

[size=14pt]The Creeper[/size]

Ssss...I mean...The creeper, probably the most feared of them all, these guys just love to explode, if they get close enough to you then you will here the &quot;ssssss&quot; sound and then, well, that&#39;s the last thing you&#39;ll ever here because then you will be blown all the way back to real life. There guys don&#39;t only kill players when they explode but they also take blocks with them, the explosions blow craters into the ground and into players creations so beware of these pesky demons!

[url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Creeper]Check out this picture of a Creeper here along with more detailed information.[/url]

[size=14pt]The Endermen[/size]

A recent addition, they guys just like to steal certain blocks and teleport. They&#39;re a very friendly mob until you look at them. If you look them in the eyes you&#39;re in for a shock when they teleport towards you and kill you. As long as you look them in the eyes they remain frozen, but as soon as you look away they teleport towards you and they can be a tough bunch. 

They also pick up blocks such as: Dirt block, Grass Block, Gravel Block, Mycelium Block, Sand Block, Clay Block, Dandelion, Rose, Mushroom, Cactus, Pumpkin, Melon, and finally TNT. They pickup these blocks, carry them for a while, and then drop them (Very messy). So it isn&#39;t advised you make your house out of anything of the above blocks, as there probably isn&#39;t going to be much left of it over time.

[url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Endermen]Check out this picture of a Endermen here along with more detailed information.[/url]
[hr]
[size=18pt]Playing Single player in general (What comes after surviving)[/size]
[anchor=spplayinggeneral]

After you&#39;ve survived for a while, you have a basic setup, a house, some sheep, a farm and you&#39;re living life easy. You may start to think: Man, placing these blocks is getting old it all seems to the same. Fear not, for there are other things that don&#39;t involve the conventional strategic block placing! Using [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone]redstone[/url] and [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Pistons]pistons[/url] you can create a lot of unique things for example: Trap doors, a hidden passage way, automated farms, and if you include [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Lamp]redstone lamps[/url] you can create a lighting system. Let me show you some of the cool stuff people have made:

[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adPm5AlaGCc]Minecraft Piston hidden passage way[/url] 

The second video is a bit of a tutorial as well.

[size=24pt]Multiplayer[/size]

[size=18pt]Playing Minecraft Multiplayer (How it is different from Single player)[/size]
[anchor=mpplaying]

Now you&#39;ve played Singleplayer but you&#39;ve heard of this mysterious land known as multiplayer. You&#39;ve probably figured out multiplayer is very much like singleplayer but with other people, but there are a few other things to consider as well. When somebody decides to open their own server they must decide on a configuration, and what plugin they wish to use on their server. They&#39;ll be met with the following decisions:


[ol][li]Should we allow PVP?[/li]
[li]Should monsters spawn at night?[/li]
[li]Is it [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Creative_(Game_Mode)]Creative[/url], [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Survival_(Game_Mode)]Survival[/url], or [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Adventure]Adventure[/url] mode?[/li]
[li]What type of world is it? [url=http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Superflat]super flat[/url], normal?[/li][/ol]


Unlike singleplayer where the configuration is very limited, and there arent many life changing plugins usually used Multiplayer can be a very different world indeed. That&#39;s why it is important you read what the server has to offer before connecting and deciding to play. Some server don&#39;t even bear any resemblance to Minecraft they&#39;ve changed so much with plugins! If you see a server say it is Vanilla then it is classic Minecraft like you&#39;ve played on Singeplayer. 

Let us move on, when playing Multiplayer you are playing with other people, so I will go through a list of things you should never never do on a multiplayer server unless specifically told you can by the owner:


[ol][li] Never destroy another persons property, they&#39;ve joined the server and built it. No matter how desperate you are most servers have a logging tool so they know who does what to peoples property - When they catch you it will get you banned from the server. Be patient and get the blocks yourself.[/li]
[li]Never ask for staff even if you want it. This is incredibly annoying, just be nice and respectful to others.[/li]
[li]Do not intentionally do damage to the environment, a lot of people don&#39;t like this and will end ip cleaning it up once they realize you keep doing it you&#39;re probably going to get asked to leave/ or face a verbal confrontation about it.[/li]
[li]Don&#39;t be annoying - If you really need stuff then ask once, perhaps twice, don&#39;t spam about it or bug everyone. They earned their items and were in the same position as you were at one point.[/li][/ol]


You can find servers on advertising boards, such as:

[url=http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/board,184.0.html]Moparcraft advertisement board[/url]

You can view servers, and post your server there!

[size=18pt]Introduction[/size]</p>
<p>Alright, here we go. Minecraft is generally a resource hungry game, the same applies for the server. No matter how good your computer is you’re gonna get lagg at some point, it can even be frequent. That’s just Minecraft for you.</p>
<p>I’d also suggest you don’t host of a laptop. Never should you host a server which requires a lot of resources at times be hosted 24/7 on a laptop - this is not good.</p>
<p>The laptop will suffer a constant strain and the heat will potentially cause damage to the machine. <span class="bbcode-b">Get a computer if you’re hosting 24/7</span>. Once your laptop reaches a certain point (heat wise) it will automatically shut down to stop components being damaged. Now we’ve got that done let’s move onto Minecraft versions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history</a></p>
<p>This is the version history for Minecraft - I’m not going to mention this a lot but I think it’s worth reading <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

[anchor=whatyouneed]</p>
<p>Now, part 2, what you need. In this part I’m going to cover all the necessary downloads you will need to progress through with this guide - I recommend you put them all in one directory so you don’t loose them as we carry on the steps.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"> List of things you need </span></p>
<p>[ul][li]WinRar - <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm[/li][/ul]</a></p>

<p>Once you’ve got all of those, you can proceed reading this guide. Now we move onto setting up!</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Setting up a server - Linux Ubuntu[/size]<br>
[anchor=settingupserver]</p>
<p>And, now we move onto what you’ve all been waiting for (The joy) setting the actual server up with all our downloads. I don’t want this guide to be quite as long as my other one so I’ll try and make this section as short and quick as possible. But before I do that I’m going to recommend you use Linux! What is Linux you may ask?</p>
<blockquote>Definitions of Linux on the Web:
an open-source version of the UNIX operating system</blockquote>
<p>Download it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download</a></p>
<p>Just follow the instructions to install it. First of all I’m going to cover setting up on linux Ubuntu - to do this I’m going to be using SSH. So you will need to download Putty/ or use terminal. If your server is in another location then use Putty.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a></p>
<p>Let’s begin. First of all some basic commands.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd /dirname/etc/etc - Goes to the specific directory
ls - displays all files in the directory you're currently in
java - once Java is installed, shows a prompt of useful information and reminders
passwd - changes the root password
nano textdocname - allows you to edit/read text files
ctrl + c - acts as a cancel feature
sudo - logs into admin priv
apt-get install package- install command
wget URL - downloads files from a direct URL
Java filename - Runs a Java app i.e .jar</code></pre>
<p>First of all we’re going to download Minecraft_server.jar using the wget function, I’ve found a direct link (Which wget requires) for this tutorial. So you do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget directlink</code></pre>
<p>So we’re going to do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/launcher/minecraft_server.jar?v=1298922308461</code></pre>
<p>This will download Minecraft_server.jar, when it has downloaded it should either go to Downloads or your current directory. This is where basic commands will come in such as ‘cd’ and ‘ls’. Perform</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ls</code></pre>
<p>To check what is in your current directory, while</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd directory</code></pre>
<p>Will take you to the specified directory, e.g cd /bin/. We will end up using this later one, once you’ve located the Minecraft_server.jar take note and move onto the next stage. Now we need to install Java, this is a very easy part. We’re going to be using the apt-get install function. I’m going to do some explaining.</p>
<p>‘apt-get’ - selects the package while the actual ‘install’ part of it tells it what to do. e.g apt-get install nano - this would install nano if the package name was correct.</p>
<p>‘sudo’ - allows the user to do administration (Gives them admin privileges).</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got that cleared up, we’re going to install Java. We simply run the following command in terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jre</code></pre>
<p>This will install the package we’ve stated. Once that is installed go back to your old directory you took note of (Preferable make it in a file to prevent a ton of mess). We will go back by doing</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd /your/dir/here</code></pre>
<p>So if mine was in /bin/ I would do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cd /bin/</code></pre>
<p>Then we’re going to actually run Minecraft_server.jar.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui</code></pre>
<p>Allow me to explain this code in more depth, the '1024mb’s are the amounts of RAM the JVM (Java virtual machine) can use.  The ‘minecraft_server.jar’ is obviously the target file and the ‘nogui’ is specifying no Graphical user interface. If you want to edit the actual files we’re going to install a text editor called ‘nano’.</p>
<p>There are other methods but I like nano (For no apparent reason at all). We’re going to use an old command ‘sudo apt-get install’</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get install nano</code></pre>
<p>This will install ‘nano’ which a text editor we can use to read/write to files. We will use it like this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">nano filename.type</code></pre>
<p>e.g</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">nano whitelist.txt</code></pre>
<p>With this installed you will be able to edit configuration files for your Minecraft server and various other things, this will also help us with our plugins later on in this guide. And that’s it! I’m just going to redirect you to a topic regarding port forwarding s there are so many things which people do wrong and so many various types, it’s just not worth typing up.</p>
<p><a href="http://portforward.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://portforward.com/</a></p>
<p>That site covers everything you’ll need to know to get your server started in regards to port forwarding.</p>

<p>[size=18pt]Bukkit - Plugins[/size]<br>
[anchor=bukkitplugins]</p>
<p>Bukkit adapts your server for multiplayer use, without Bukkit multiplayer would be very different. It provides great mods such as big brother (BB) which are an anti-griefeing tool used by countless servers. In this part I’m going to show you how to set it up. (On Linux)</p>
<p>First of all you’re going to need to download it.<br>
<a href="http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server</a></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget URL</code></pre>
<p>To download the file, then</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">ls</code></pre>
<p>To check what’s in the directory. And finally to actually run Bukkit we’re going to be using a different run code from normal</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#! /bin/sh 
BINDIR="$(dirname "$(readlink -fn "$0")")"
cd "$BINDIR"
java -Xincgc -Xmx1G -jar craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar</code></pre>
<p>We’re going to use nano to do this. Type</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">nano </code></pre>
<p>Then we’re going to edit it with the run code, then do ctrl + o to save it. Then we have to do chmod to give it permissions to execute the code. We simply do</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">chmod +x Minecraft.sh</code></pre>
<p>This will give it +x which is executable, then we simply execute it everytime you want to launch Bukkit. And now for some basic information regarding plugins, if you want plugins then you can find them all at</p>
<p><a href="http://plugins.bukkit.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://plugins.bukkit.org/</a></p>
<p>That contains a vast library of plugins you can use, based on version etc again, if you want to download one, go to the ‘plugins’ directory and then</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">wget directlink</code></pre>
<p>It will then download it. If it’s a .jar simply run your server as I showed you before, if it is a zip you can use methods such as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">unzip file</code></pre>
<p>and then run your server - if a plugin is complex it will most likely contain instructions on setting things up such as SQL.</p>

<p>[size=18pt]General Problems[/size]<br>
[anchor=genproblems]</p>
<p>Many problems can arrise with server performance as well as errors in setup so in this part I’m going to try and target these problems.</p>
<blockquote>Not enough RAM! - Reserve the JVM more RAM by increasing the 1024, 512mb (XMX).
Can't keep up! - Reserve the server more resources
Can't find the package - The package you're trying to do something with does not exist</blockquote>
<p>These are just what spring to mind, if you find any please don’t hesitate to post. I’ll then add to this and hopefully fix them!</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Miscellaneous[/size]<br>
[anchor=miscellaneous]</p>
<p>I didn’t really have much to say here, it was just for future reference. So for now I’m going to leave this pretty much empty. I’d also like to add in the future (soon) I’m going to expand this tutorial into other Operating systems such as Windows, MAC etc…</p>
<p>But for now please submit any errors, or any feed back on the thread! Thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>[size=18pt]Setting up your own server - Windows![/size]<br>
[anchor=settingupserverwindows]<br>
Most of you will know what Windows is, so I doubt I’ll need to put an explanation. I’m going to make this as short as possible and avoid all room for speculation about the Operating system itself.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"> List of things you need </span></p>
<p>[ul][li]WinRar - <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Java - <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.java.com/en/download/[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Minecraft - <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>[ul][li]Bukkit - <a href="http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server%5B/li%5D%5B/ul%5D">http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server[/li][/ul]</a></p>
<p>This time we’re going to download Minecraft_server.exe which can also be found at <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp">http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp</a> Once you’ve downloaded it create a new folder called ‘minecraft’ in a specified directory.</p>
<p>Then simply run the EXE file, it will then bring up a GUI (Graphical User Interface) - It will also make multiple files.</p>
<p><img src="http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm78/5frtgvhy/filesmadeexe.jpg" alt width="320" height="320"></p>
<p>I’m now going to explain what each of those individual files are responsible for, and what functions you can edit. This can be used across all OS - I just include it here.</p>
<blockquote>[i] Files 
<p>Banned-ips - contains all banned ips</p>
<p>banned-players - contains all banned playerNames</p>
<p>ops - contains the name of all servers OPS</p>
<p>Server - a log of everything printed out on the GUI</p>
<p>white-list - a list of names which are allowed to play your server if the whitelist function is enabled in properties.<br>
[/i]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I’ve left out properties because I want to go into more detail on it. Properties has a ton of stuff you can edit such as save name etc</p>
<blockquote>#Minecraft server properties
#Sat Apr 16 21:23:33 BST 2011
level-name=world // save name
hellworld=false
spawn-monsters=true // spawn mobs?
online-mode=true // if this is true hacked clients won't be able to connect
spawn-animals=true // spawn things like pigs etc
max-players=20 // maximum players on your server at one time
server-ip= // ip of server
pvp=true // is playervsplayer on?
level-seed= // seed i.e Tom_BETA
server-port=25565 // server port number IP:PORTNUMBER
white-list=false // does it use the whitelist function stated above?</blockquote>
<p>That’s a brief overview of the properties file. Now that you’ve ran the EXE the server is listening for connections on the specific port in the properties file, so remember to change that! If you need to portforward then simply use the following site.</p>
<p><a href="http://portforward.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://portforward.com/</a></p>
<p>It will cover everything in regards to portforwarding your router.<br>

[size=24pt]Bukkit - What is it? Why do we use it? And how can I get started?[/size]<br>
[anchor=bdintroduction]</p>
<blockquote>Bukkit is the name of a set of community built, open source tools envisioned and developed to ease the creation of SMP plugins. It was intended to replace hey0's Mod. Because some of the developers involved had already been involved in hey0's Mod, there are similarities between the two plugins. However, mods written for hey0 had to be ported to use the Bukkit Application Programming Interface (API).</blockquote>
<p>If you still don’t understand what Bukkit is, then essentially it allows developers to create plugins for Minecraft. Pretty much every multiplayer server will have plugins, they range from login authentication, all the way to disabling TNT for specific players. Plugins are everywhere and are very popular.</p>
<p>We use it for many reasons, security, fun, bug fixes it is away for the community to change the game. A lot of servers use roll back tools which allow for any griefing that occurs to be rolled back, another major benefit. So you’re probably pretty impressed by this stage and eager to get going but allow me to give you the annoying news:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Bukkit isn’t perfect, not by a long shot, usually their snapshop releases contain bugs even fatal ones which can cause the server to crash completely or have performance issues, while Bukkit is working on this they’re not out of the woods yet so be careful and ensure you test Bukkit thoroughly before going public. [/li]<br>
[li]Make sure you understand what you’re adding to your server, people can put exploits in the plugin code and then abuse it on your server. If a mysterious man turns up on your server one asking you to install his awesome plugin then use your common sense and proceed with caution.[/li]<br>
[li]As a general rule of thumb don’t install what you don’t need.[/li]<br>
[li]Bukkit can be very slow to update, once Minecraft has an update they have to update as well, and so do plugin developers. Patience is key, but if you can try to get the plugins that update quicker if it doesn’t compromise anything important. Wait times can be a pain for players as they want to play the newest miencraft version as much as you do.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>Now that’s covered, how do you get started? Simple! <a href="http://dl.bukkit.org/downloads/craftbukkit/" data-bbcode="true">You can download Bukkit here for your Minecraft version</a>.</p>

[anchor=bdres]<br>
I could write out what I feel would be an awesome code example on how the basic functions of Bukkit work, or show you a cool plugin. But I have no intention of writing a book on programming with the Bukkit API. There are thousands of tutorials on the web that have explained more than I ever could fit in this post so I’m going to direct you towards what I feel explain the basics the best, and how you can understand plugin structure a little more:</p>
<p>What you may need:<br>

<p>In minecraft there is a lot of things which can go wrong, such as being griefed, flooded, etc. This will teach you how to avoid those bad things.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> 1) </span> - Don’t build near spawn, I mean really? The griefers will logon, and you’ll be the first thing they’ll see.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> 2) </span> - Don’t make your house out of dirt, endermen will take it down within no time.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> 3) </span> - Always password protect your chests!You never know who can get into your house.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> 4) </span> - Only build near a cave if you know what you’re doing, this can be a bad idea as there will be A LOT of mobs.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> 5) </span> - Keep time in mind, NEVER loose track of time.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> 6) </span>- Don’t mine directly above or below you. Gravel might fall on you and kill you or you might fall into a cavern or into lava and burn to death. (K0 Twin)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> 7) </span> - Always use /sethome (or sleep in a bed) in your home location!<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Tips:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You can only fall from 3 or less blocks/meters without taking damage.</li>
<li>Water is very handy to carry around with you, in case you accidentally touch lava</li>
<li>A compass points towards your spawn point, and is great to have while exploring, in case you get lost.</li>
</ul>

[size=18pt]A brief introduction to Minecraft (What is it, who made it, and so on!)[/size]<br>
[anchor=giintroduction]</p>
<p>Minecraft is a sandbox game, there are literally no limits to what you can do on Minecraft. The world expands as you explore and the chances of you running out of space are virtually non-existent. In Minecraft there is no set Map like on most games, each world you make is randomly generated meaning no two maps are ever going to be the same. This allows for a unique and challenging experience each time you play the game, even if you’ve played for years no object will be found in the same place.</p>
<p>One of the main objectives of Minecraft for most people is to build a house, this can be done by using the hundreds of unique blocks which are ingame from wood to ice Minecraft truly does have it all making it a great hit among creative enthusiasts, at the same time Minecraft is also popular for its PVP aspect it offers an intense experience for those who wish to go head to head in the battlefield, for that, Minecraft offers bows, sword, explosives and multiple ways to create traps and fortresses to enhance the fight. From dragon fights to Jedi temple remakes, there really is no limit to what you can do in Minecraft.</p>
<p>Minecraft was created by a man called Notch, his real name is Markus Persson. He developed Minecraft in the early stages of the game single handedly as an indie game developer. Once Minecraft started to become popular he got an office and recruited other members which ultimately today form Mojang. This includes Jeb who now works on the game full time as the lead developer, you can find their social media links below:</p>

[size=18pt]How far has Minecraft come since its initial release?[/size]<br>
[anchor=giinitrelease]<br>
Minecraft has sold over 6 million copies, thats a hell of a lot for just a small team of developers. It went from PC to Xbox360 this year topping to charts there as well. I would write out about how far Minecraft has come but a brilliant documentary was made of Mojang not so long ago. You can watch it yourself:</p>

[size=18pt]Where is Minecraft heading?[/size]<br>

Minecraft is now officially released, from what started of with a game without a day and night cycle with missing core elements in Alpha it has certainly gone far, and shows no signs of stopping yet. <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history" data-bbcode="true">Check out the past/future updates</a> 1.3 promises even more interesting content.<br>

<p>[size=18pt]Playing Minecraft (Playing for free, and troubleshooting)[/size]<br>
[anchor=spplaying]<br>
Many people chose to download a cracked Minecraft version simply because they don’t have the money to pay for actual Minecraft, other do it because they want to try out the game before paying the money for it. This is understandable, though I’d like to suggest if you ever find the money that <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/store" data-bbcode="true">you should purchase Minecraft from their website.</a></p>
<p>Anyhow, moving on, to play Minecraft for free you want to download a cracked client. There are multiple versions released, here are a few downloads:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?6988po8yw5us8sw" data-bbcode="true">.EXE version</a> - by Lilxcj<br>
<a href="http://uppit.com/ekpzpqtnv84z/minecraft.jar" data-bbcode="true">.JAR version</a> - by CoonHunter</p>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded the file you simply execute it and then play, it is pretty self explanatory. Be warned though, some servers have cracked clients disabled meaning you cannot play unless you buy the game. You may struggle to find a server which allows cracked clients, <a href="http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/topic,550652.0.html" data-bbcode="true">though I do reccomend the community server where we do allow cracked clients.</a></p>
<p>Sometimes the client may fail to start all I can recommend is that you try both JAR/EXE to see which one suits you the most. Aside from that please ensure you have all the required installations such as Java.<br>

[size=18pt]An introduction to the game (Surviving your first night)[/size]<br>
[anchor=spintro]<br>
Minecraft survival can seem like a daunting place, with creatures hunting you at night that is. Not to fear, after this section you’ll be well equipped with knowledge on how to keep these monsters away, and survive, until the day! We all learn differently so I’ll provide what I feel is a good video made by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/paulsoaresjr" data-bbcode="true">paulsoaresjr</a>:</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="B36Ehzf2cxE" data-youtube-title="Minecraft Tutorials - E01 How to Survive your First Night (UPDATED!)" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>As a generally quick text representation, you want to just aim to survive on your first night, don’t go building a city or anything. The first night is about the core element of the game: Survival. You want to find <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Coal_Orer" data-bbcode="true">coal</a> to produce <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Torch" data-bbcode="true">torches</a> which you can then use to light up your area, torches produce light which in turn stop mobs from spawning thus protecting you through the night. What you want to build your starter house of is entirely up to you, though I’d strongly not suggest anything too technical at such an early stage in the game. I’m a strong believer in establishing a base of operations and then expanding it as you progress in the game. It is also important that you know who the monsters are, and what they can do:</p>
<p>[size=14pt]The Zombie[/size]</p>
<p>A classical hit among gamers, and movie lovers, where would the world be right now without the old Zombie. Minecraft also has this trend too, Zombies spawn in dark areas (such as caves, or at night time). They’re easy to spot, they burn in natural sun light so if you’re even being chased in a cave and can’t win, go to the sun and they will burn alive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Zombie" data-bbcode="true">Check out this picture of a Zombie here along with more detailed information.</a></p>
<p>[size=14pt]The Skeleton[/size]</p>
<p>Or known as, the Skeletal Archer. These guys are what they’re called: Skeletons. They come with a bow and unlimited arrows and are sharpshooters. Even the guys from the Matrix would struggle to dodge these shots!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Skeleton" data-bbcode="true">Check out this picture of a Skeleton here along with more detailed information.</a></p>
<p>[size=14pt]The Creeper[/size]</p>
<p>Ssss…I mean…The creeper, probably the most feared of them all, these guys just love to explode, if they get close enough to you then you will here the “ssssss” sound and then, well, that’s the last thing you’ll ever here because then you will be blown all the way back to real life. There guys don’t only kill players when they explode but they also take blocks with them, the explosions blow craters into the ground and into players creations so beware of these pesky demons!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Creeper" data-bbcode="true">Check out this picture of a Creeper here along with more detailed information.</a></p>
<p>[size=14pt]The Endermen[/size]</p>
<p>A recent addition, they guys just like to steal certain blocks and teleport. They’re a very friendly mob until you look at them. If you look them in the eyes you’re in for a shock when they teleport towards you and kill you. As long as you look them in the eyes they remain frozen, but as soon as you look away they teleport towards you and they can be a tough bunch.</p>
<p>They also pick up blocks such as: Dirt block, Grass Block, Gravel Block, Mycelium Block, Sand Block, Clay Block, Dandelion, Rose, Mushroom, Cactus, Pumpkin, Melon, and finally TNT. They pickup these blocks, carry them for a while, and then drop them (Very messy). So it isn’t advised you make your house out of anything of the above blocks, as there probably isn’t going to be much left of it over time.</p>

[hr]<br>
[size=18pt]Playing Single player in general (What comes after surviving)[/size]<br>
[anchor=spplayinggeneral]</p>
<p>After you’ve survived for a while, you have a basic setup, a house, some sheep, a farm and you’re living life easy. You may start to think: Man, placing these blocks is getting old it all seems to the same. Fear not, for there are other things that don’t involve the conventional strategic block placing! Using <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone" data-bbcode="true">redstone</a> and <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Pistons" data-bbcode="true">pistons</a> you can create a lot of unique things for example: Trap doors, a hidden passage way, automated farms, and if you include <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Lamp" data-bbcode="true">redstone lamps</a> you can create a lighting system. Let me show you some of the cool stuff people have made:</p>

[size=24pt]Multiplayer[/size]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Playing Minecraft Multiplayer (How it is different from Single player)[/size]<br>
[anchor=mpplaying]</p>
<p>Now you’ve played Singleplayer but you’ve heard of this mysterious land known as multiplayer. You’ve probably figured out multiplayer is very much like singleplayer but with other people, but there are a few other things to consider as well. When somebody decides to open their own server they must decide on a configuration, and what plugin they wish to use on their server. They’ll be met with the following decisions:</p>
<p>[ol][li]Should we allow PVP?[/li]<br>
[li]Should monsters spawn at night?[/li]<br>
[li]Is it <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Creative_(Game_Mode)" data-bbcode="true">Creative</a>, <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Survival_(Game_Mode)" data-bbcode="true">Survival</a>, or <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Adventure" data-bbcode="true">Adventure</a> mode?[/li]<br>
[li]What type of world is it? <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Superflat" data-bbcode="true">super flat</a>, normal?[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>Unlike singleplayer where the configuration is very limited, and there arent many life changing plugins usually used Multiplayer can be a very different world indeed. That’s why it is important you read what the server has to offer before connecting and deciding to play. Some server don’t even bear any resemblance to Minecraft they’ve changed so much with plugins! If you see a server say it is Vanilla then it is classic Minecraft like you’ve played on Singeplayer.</p>
<p>Let us move on, when playing Multiplayer you are playing with other people, so I will go through a list of things you should never never do on a multiplayer server unless specifically told you can by the owner:</p>
<p>[ol][li] Never destroy another persons property, they’ve joined the server and built it. No matter how desperate you are most servers have a logging tool so they know who does what to peoples property - When they catch you it will get you banned from the server. Be patient and get the blocks yourself.[/li]<br>
[li]Never ask for staff even if you want it. This is incredibly annoying, just be nice and respectful to others.[/li]<br>
[li]Do not intentionally do damage to the environment, a lot of people don’t like this and will end ip cleaning it up once they realize you keep doing it you’re probably going to get asked to leave/ or face a verbal confrontation about it.[/li]<br>
[li]Don’t be annoying - If you really need stuff then ask once, perhaps twice, don’t spam about it or bug everyone. They earned their items and were in the same position as you were at one point.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>You can find servers on advertising boards, such as:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moparcraft.net/smf/index.php/board,184.0.html" data-bbcode="true">Moparcraft advertisement board</a></p>
<p>You can view servers, and post your server there!<br>
