    <description>well another lacrosse stringing has popped up again and you guys helped me out lasttime by getting me some votes. it looks like i need help again since i suck at photoshop.

i need this picture of green lantern http://www.pollpub.com/images/member_photos/pollpubimg03700gl-kyle2.jpg

to be photoshoped into this lacrosse picture http://s61.photobucket.com/albums/h76/laxfootball34/space%20commander/?action=view&amp;current=IMG_1166.jpg click on this picture to make it bigger.

it must not cover the netting or the head. i was looking for like maybe the green latern on both sides of the head and then have it say below the picture green latern in neon green letters.
