    <title>Custom Interfaces - [PI] Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-interfaces-pi-rep/411997</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve just recently been interesting in client sided coding, I know how to add interfaces, but not reallly much, I dont fully understand on how it gets the sprites and pulls them toegether, at certain places. So if somebody could kinda explain to me, how to create custom interfaces, such as making them appear in a certain position on the screen and add other sprites to it. 
Ive tried getting tutorials but I cant find any so I&#39;m posting here
