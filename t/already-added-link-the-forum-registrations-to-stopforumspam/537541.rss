    <description>StopForumSpam is a priceless tool for all forums. It is a massive database of spammers and is constantly updated, allowing board administrators to automatically check new registrants&#39; details (username, e-mail, IP) against those in the database.

As an example, ganu874 (the poster of [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,656360.0.html]this topic[/url]) could have [url=http://www.stopforumspam.com/ipcheck/124.253.9.52]been found in the database[/url] and this particular spam post prevented. It&#39;s relatively easy to install into a board (minor modifications only) and in my experience it prevents massive amounts of spam.</description>

              <p>I’m fairly certain we already have this and have had it for a while, it’s blocked over 84,000 members who were bots up to now. I’m not sure why that particular instance wasn’t picked up but it’s doing the trick for a lot of cases.</p>
