    <title>Paying Cash if someone can make these</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-cash-if-someone-can-make-these/85034</link>
    <description>Hello all, if you dont have paypal then theres no point responding as thats how i will pay.

Here is the list of scripts that i want and what i want them to do:

Miner Banker

I Want a miner for all ores with these locations:
Lumy swamp with banking at draynor
Coal Trucks with fill and empty minning cart with banking at camelot
Guild miner with fally east banking
Yanille (iron,MIth) with banking at yanille

Runcrafter and banker:
Air rune crafter fally east banking
Fire Crafter AL Kharid banking
Law crafter with draynor banking
Nature crafter (sells ess to shop and buys unoted) No banking - and if the charcter gets to half health logs out.

Flax picker and spinner 
Picks flax spins then banks

Smelt and smith (not running together but i want to choose what action)
Smelting AL kharid
Smithing Varok
Smelt ores into bars:
Iron - Steel - Mith - Addy - Rune
Smiths bars into knives, cannon balls, arrow heads

Im not looking at shitty scripts i want something with quality and that works not something that will get lost die or log out. These scripts will be used on my main account hence why i want quality.

I dont care if the script takes a little longer to do what its doing as long as its good.

I want the script as automatic as possible including colour picking.
I want it to log in if it logs out

Remember people i will be paying in cash.

Here is a link of a great example of how i want it to run.
