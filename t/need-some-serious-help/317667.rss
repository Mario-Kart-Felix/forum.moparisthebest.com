    <title>Need some serious help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-serious-help/317667</link>
    <description>Ok, well I used to code and make my own servers, it was kinda a hobby of mine.  I haven&#39;t done it in about 2 years now and as you all know things have changed drastically.  I still know how to code the servers, but what I cant figure out is how to actually get on the server and get into the server.java, and client.java to edit and change stuff (maybe this changed and we do it a different way?).  So my question is simply, how do we find the client.java and server.java in order to edit and change and code the server?  Whenever I download a client in the download section i just get a bunch of folders and .class files (which i&#39;ve never worked with before so I don&#39;t know what they are).

So anyone that could help me find the server.java and client.java and how to actually get onto the server myself so I can edit it, I&#39;d really appreciate.

Thanks :)</description>

I guess you are editing servers using a batch file to compile and notepad to edit?<br>
Download Eclipse… It’s easy to learn to use.<br>
Create a new project using existing source.</p>
