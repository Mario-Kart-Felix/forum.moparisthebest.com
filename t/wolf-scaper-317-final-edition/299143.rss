    <title>Wolf Scaper 317 [Final Edition]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wolf-scaper-317-final-edition/299143</link>
    <description>Well, I started this source a long time ago, I wish I could continue to host but sadly, my hoster has quit on me.  So, I will tell you what the server has and what I&#39;m going to be adding before I release.


FEATURES:

Melee - 100%
Range - 100% (even have arrows dropping)
Defense - 100% (correct armor bonus&#39;s and requirements)
Magic - 96% (Auto-casting With Ancients and Modern.  Most Lunar spells added)
Non - Combat Skills - All 100% (no errors with any of them)
Spirit - 100% (This is a custom skill I made, its sort of like summoning but focus)
Spirit Hunter - 100% (Capture spirits and create monsters to summon, higher spirit longer last)
Pedagry - 100% (Allows you to summon and have pets)

Server Side:

I have 3 Packet parsers, this way I can add whatever I want wherever I want.
16 Quests - Deltas and Mine.
Training areas, allows you to train for your level.
Strip Club - Uhm, yeah, I was bored one day, making it so you need to pay to get in.
Trade Center - Added this for trading purposes, this allows you to sell items even while offline.
Fun PK - Kill people for fun.
Good EXP rate - 80 for combat skills 30 for shared EXP (controlled) 35 for Hitpoints.
Max EXP 377,000,000 - I did what no other server has, max exp raised :D
Max Level 133 - Why stop at 99, thats boring.
Tons Of Minigames - Custom minigames to get good items.
Level Requirements - No more freeloaders, there are requirements for games.
Fixed Duping - I fixed all methods of duping through trade, death and dueling.
Anti - Null - Never will null on you
Anti - SYI - 1 connection per IP and only aloud usernames with 12 or less characters
Guild System - I made a guild system this way you can join a guild and have something special


Guilds:
Melee
Range
Magic
Skills

Guilds are meant for PKING when you are in a guild you get extra bonus&#39;s.


Client Side:

Lag reducer - When you log in it creates your character then kicks you, then makes you wait 10 seconds.  Then you log in and you have less lag.  This is caused mainly cause when you log in you probably lag from loading the details, the 10 seconds takes that lag out and loads them into your client instead of when you log in.
Godsword Stances - Thanks to CJ
Godsword Emotes - Specials and Combat emotes - CJ, Mrpotatohead, me(adding the frames into client and that)
Over 150 custom items - tons of weapons, armor and much more!





Honestly, This server is really popular.  I wish I could continue to host, but my computer sucks.  So yeah, R.I.P. Wolf Scaper 317


If you want to watch videos to see how popular this server is, just go onto:

Google
Youtube
Yahoo

and search

Wolf scaper 317

Out of advertisement videos, we got over 50k views total and over 70k players - Moparscape for around 7k players
Out of best runescape private server we are ranked number 2 most viewed for 317&#39;s still up
Rated by many players the server is 9/10
Around 50+ players on just when we start up the server.



Well, I hope you guys can be cool about this, so yeah.  I left out one thing.


All sounds added (NPC sounds still working on 60% done)
Music added (special areas only)



So yeah, I guess I can show you guys some pics
