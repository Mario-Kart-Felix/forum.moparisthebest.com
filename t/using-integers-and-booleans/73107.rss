[size=15pt][b][u]Chapter 1:[/u][/b] The Integer[/size]


[b]Explanation of uses of an integer:[/b]
An integer will be used to state something. A good example of this is the playerRights = (integer) function for mods/admins.

[b]Some information:[/b]
An integer can be used for many things, to define certain teams in a minigame, or something as simple as moderator or admin.

[b]Use:[/b]
Okay, first things first, we need to declare the integer before we can use it. In most clients, there are sections made specifically for integers and booleans, I like to place my integers near the top of client.java. To declare it, you need to state &quot;public int&quot;, then the name of your integer, then an &quot;= 0;&quot;.
Example:

[code]
public int team = 0;
[/code]
So now we&#39;ve declared our integer, now its time to use it.
To apply the integer to someone:
When a person logs in, any integer will be set to 0, unless otherwise specified. To define someone in an integer, you would use &quot;(integer name) = 1;&quot;. An integer will go on to unlimited numbers. so you can use a 2 instead of a 1, or any number you like.
Here is how you would set an integer in a command:

[code]
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;commandname&quot;)) {
team = 1;
}
[/code]
That will define the players integer, which is &quot;team&quot;, in this case, to 1.

To make effects of an integer:

Here comes the creative part. To make an effect of an integer, you must use an &quot;if&quot; statement, followed by the integer, with TWO equals signs. Most of the time, things like this are put in &quot;public boolean process()&quot;, because it is called every 500 milliseconds. It would look like this:

[code]
if (team == 1)) {[/code]Now, under that, we would place the effects.

[code]if (team == 1)) {
playerRights = 2;
}
[/code]
Now I know that is extremely unlogical, but to make my point, you can combine two integers in one method. As you see, I made it so that if the persons integer for &quot;team&quot; is 1, then their playerRights are 2, therefore making them an admin.
This ends my section of integers, I hope you now understand the function and format of an integer.
Now I will move on to the next section, the boolean.

[size=15pt][b][u]Chapter 2:[/u][/b] The Boolean[/size]


[b]Basic information:[/b]
A boolean is used for a true/false statement. It can be applied to almost anything, and is sometimes more useful then the integer.

[b]Use:[/b]

First, you need to declare the boolean, like the integer. This time, it will appear as so:

[code]
public boolean (name) = false;[/code]Let me name this, to define a team.

[code]
public boolean redteam = false;[/code]Okay, so now we have the boolean declared, now to use it.
To apply the boolean to a player, you could use a command, as so:

[code]
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;red&quot;)) {
redteam = true;
}
[/code]
This would set someones red team true/false statement to true.
So, if someone were to type ::red, the server would then identify them on the redteam (Red Team).
Now, to use a boolean in an if statement, it would appear like this:

[code]
if (redteam == true)) {
playerRights = 2;
}
[/code]
You can combine booleans with integers, as shown.
This states that if a character is on the red team, by typing ::red, they will become an admin.

That basically sums up the tutorial, I hope you all learned a few things.

[b]Reasons why I made this:[/b] I have never seen a tutorial for this on these forums, and I believe that people need to learn this, so I posted this.

<p>No. Teach them WHAT and HOW JAVA HANDLES and int first! Teach us about boxing and unboxing, primitives and objects. The real way to use an int would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int name = new Integer();
name = 0;</code></pre>
<p>But you don’t need to do that, since java has autoboxing, you can just write ‘int name = 0’.</p>
<p>Second of all, you actually wrote FALSE information. eg,</p>
<blockquote>So, if someone were to type ::red, the server would then identify them on the redteam (Red Team).</blockquote>
No, if someone were to type ::red, the boolean would become true. If you wanted to flag the user as on the red team, you would have to edit the config file for that player.

WTF!/!/!&gt;&gt;!&gt;!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT A METHOD IS!??!?!
