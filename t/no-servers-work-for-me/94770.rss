    <title>No servers work for me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-servers-work-for-me/94770</link>
    <description>I have been using the server status page to find servers today. As of yet I could only get one to work. It was Buzzscape. Every other one I try always tells me to click cancel and use new server thing etc. Does anyone know why I am not able to use these servers? It says they are all up.

Also could someone give me the ip to Buzzscape? I can&#39;t find it  :(</description>

LogMeIn Hamachi is a zero-configuration virtual private networking (VPN) application.</p>
<p>In other words Hamachi is a program that allows you to arrange multiple computers into their own secure network just as if they were connected by a physical network cable.</p>
<p>Hamachi is fast, secure and simple. Its core version is also free.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">What’s in it for me?</span></span><br>
Hamachi gives you LAN over the Internet.</p>
<p>Virtually any application that works over local/home networks can also be used over Hamachi networks.</p>
<p>Think - Windows File Sharing, iTunes, Remote Desktop, Remote Assistance or even gaming - all fully encrypted, authenticated and peer-to-peer.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Technology</span></span><br>
Hamachi is a zero-configuration virtual private networking application with an open security architecture and NAT-to-NAT traversal capabilities.</p>
<p>Hamachi is the first application to mix seemingly unrelated networking technologies in one powerful package to deliver an unprecedented level of direct peer-to-peer connectivity. More …</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Security</span></span><br>
Hamachi is secure. All Hamachi communications are encrypted and authenticated with industry-standard algorithms and protocols. Nobody will be able to see what two Hamachi peers are talking about. Not even us.</p>
<p>However what is equally important - Hamachi security architecture is completely open meaning that its detailed description is available to anyone interested for review and validation. More …</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Ease of Use</span></span><br>
Great effort went into designing and polishing the Hamachi user interface. The result is sleek, simple and intuitive; yet still very functional. Everything you need, nothing you don’t.</p>
<p>Hamachi software contains no spyware, bannerware or any other -ware unrelated to its purpose. And it never will.</p>
