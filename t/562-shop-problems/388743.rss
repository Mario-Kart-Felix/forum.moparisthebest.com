    <description>Hello, I need help with my 562&#39;s shops....
This is the problem,
When I open my shop and I try to buy something, Nothing happens!



For Example,

I Go into the shop and I can see everything. But when i try to buy it nothing happens!

If someone could help me out with that, that would be EPIC!</description>
