    <description>[size=20pt][b]Series One - Principal Robot[/b][/size]

Jerry (12 years old) is a boy who is extremely disappoined at Rhino school. Rhino school, the most boring school in the world, literally. Now Jerry doesn&#39;t want to spend his years of childhood in this school. So he wants a change. The principal has announced a contest for all grade 7&#39;s to invent something and the most creative invention will win principal for a week. Jerry can do so much in a week, and one of the things would be to fire all teachers (because all of them are boring) and change the school, but will he win? And what&#39;s stopping him from winning? Read series one - Principal Robot to find out.

[b](1) Robots Can Make You A Principal[/b]

    It was Monday morning and Jerry (Jay – ree) was way sleepier then he had been ever before. He would always be sleepy on Mondays, because he woke up at 7:30 after the weekends. It was a big pain, especially if your school had the most boring teachers ever. Like how Ms. Soprano takes over a minute to say a sentence. How Mr. Honey is worse than his students at gym. It would take hours to explain all of the teachers at Rhino school. However, Jerry had friends. Jerry had friends that hated their teachers as much as Jerry did, if not more. Adam (Jerry’s best friend) brought apples everyday to Ms. Soprano. Right now, you would think he likes Ms. Soprano, but he doesn’t. Every time he’s about to hand the apple to Ms. Soprano, he would think that it’s another chance of hitting her as hard as he can on the face.  By now, you might be thinking, why doesn’t Jerry ask his parents to move schools? And why did his parents put him in the school in the first place? Well it’s because Rhino school is where all of Jerry’s friends were and it would be a shame if he ditched them all just to go to a better, less-boring school. And his parents only keep him in this school because it’s the cheapest. Like all parents in the community, Jerry’s parents wanted to save money for their son’s college. It’s a shame that the kids never get their favorite television channels, game consoles, and their freedom. All they would get after school would be “study hard, son!” And Jerry was sick of it. He was sick of his teachers, Rhino – cheap – school, and wanted to do something about it.

    After school, the class heard the afternoon announcements. Today, they were no ordinary announcements. Today, the principal held a contest for principal for a week. If it were Jerry or Adam winning, they would fire all the teachers; make the school WAY more fun for the students and staff. That was pretty much their biggest dream. But, you must invent the craziest thing in the entire school to win. Every grade 7 had to participate. This was the chance for Jerry to change his life for once.
 
    Jerry had millions of ideas going through his brain of what to invent: A robot that does things for you, a robot that does your homework, a robot that tells you the future, and what other robots. Why robots? Because Jerry as a small boy loved the show: Robotron. It was a cartoon show about robots helping each other survive from the human race. The humans lived on Earth, and the robots lived on Cartonomia (khar- tawn – na – owh – mee- a). Scientists wanted to capture the robots as they would cost millions of dollars. But for all Jerry’s inventing ideas, he wouldn’t know how to make the robot he wants. So, he would go to the only person he believes that can make such things, his dad.

    Jerry came up to his father, the father who expected more than the most from his son. “Hey dad, can you help me out with something?” Jerry asked, looking innocent so that his dad wouldn’t slap him in the face after he tells him what he wants. “Sure son, what is it?” His dad replied. His dad had an extremely deep voice. “Can you help me make a robot?” Jerry replied, very quickly so it won’t seem like he’s gone nuts. There was no need for saying it fast though, his dad would do anything for Jerry to become a doctor, engineer or a lawyer. And helping him at school was the least he could do. “Sure, what for?” Jerry couldn’t believe that his dad accepted a crazy request. Think about it say “can you make me a robot for school?” to your dad, and see if he would help you. “It’s a school assignment. Every grade 7 has to do it. It’s like for your report card for term 2.” Jerry had to lie. Else his dad would think he is too desperate for becoming principal.  And the reply was a perfect trap for making his dad help him, as passing in school was all his dad wanted for Jerry. “Let’s get to work then! I’ll need the following materials….” Jerry’s dad wasted no time and they got to work.

[b](2) Power Tool Engineering[/b]

    Jerry and his dad were no engineers or power tool experts, but they were enough to make a robot! Weird to say how no one ever invented a fully working robot before, and these two non-experienced ones can do it? Well I or no one said that they can, now keep reading, reader!
 
    After five whole days (120 hours of straight work), they finished the head. It looked extremely creepy and seemed like it would haunt you at night. Super red eyes, supposed to shoot laser, super triangle nose, supposed to flash when robot talked, and super straight-horizontal lined grey mouth, supposed to move when robot talked. Everything was a ‘supposed-to’ at this minute, but Jerry’s dad was confident to promise they will make something like a robot. “Well, you better get to bed now. It’s getting late”. It was 11:30 PM right now, when Jerry usually slept at 9:30. Suddenly, the phone rang and Mr. Jerry (Jerry’s dad) picked up.
 
    “Hello?” “Can I speak to Jerry?” “Jerry, it’s for you!!!” “Hi Jerry, whatcha doing the project on?” It was Adam speaking. “I’m working on a robot with my dad.” “Still obsessed with robots, huh?” Adam was actually into robots too, as they were both 12 years old, Adam used to watch Robotron to. But Jerry was so loyal to Robotron; he would memorize all of the words in an episode if he had to, to watch another episode. “It was just a good idea. I mean like it’s never-done before, so I thought my dad and I could try. It’s going good, we’re done the head.” “’K, well my mom is telling me to go sleep. I’ll call you tomorrow.” “Ok bye.” “Ok Jerry, go to sleep now.” Mr. Jerry read the guide to becoming a good parent. On chapter 41 (yes, there are that many chapters), it said “make your child sleep early. They need to get their sleep for the next day.”
    At night, something strange happened. Not something that would happen. Not something you consider strange, but in this case it was very strange. Jerry got kidnapped. Who did he get kidnapped by? I don’t know. I’m just the narrator, what should I know?

[b](3) Kidnap[/b]

    Normally, you wouldn’t get kidnapped when you are sleeping. But it happened to Jerry. Yes, Jerry got kidnapped when he was sleeping. Strangely enough, he was still sleeping. After hours of flight on a broomstick (No, I don’t think it’s a witch) with Jerry still sleeping, they arrived at a place. This place was a lot like a haunted house. Black walls, broken roof, smashed windows, huge in size. Then, the two kidnappers revealed themselves. They were two girl witches (I was wrong, they were witches).  The girls woke Jerry up. Jerry somehow recognized the two girls and was freaking out. His mind right now, like his millions of idea for the project, was filled with millions of questions. “How did I get here? Do I know you? Where’s my dad? Did you steal my night light?” “Oh, you will find it all out very soon” The taller girl said. They brought Jerry into the house and the house turned out to be much smaller inside than it looked out. Jerry recognized this area. Yes! It was the house where he was born 12 years ago! Knowing that, Jerry found out who the girls were. They were two of the creepiest girls in the entire school named Sema (seh – mah (the tall one)) and the more wicked one, Keema (keeh- mah (the smaller but more wicked on)). They were girls who burnt their homework, loved to torture, and got suspended for 20 days for around 7 times in mid school. But it still came to Jerry’s mind, why did they kidnap him and how in the world did they inherit such magic and power?

    “You should by now recognize us.” Sema said. “Yes I do, now how did you get such power?” Jerry asked curiously. “We hacked into Mr. Bronto Byte’s lab and stole microchips. Then we hacked into your house, and made your hard worked on robot head a read robot powered thing using Mr.Bronto Byte’s microchip.” Keema explained. After all, it was her idea. And yes, Mr. Bronto Byte is the school’s computer teacher, and he is named after a unit of space in computers. Jerry understood it all. They made his robot work and then made it their servant and stole all the power the robot had. How did the microchip work? The robot already had wires inside it. It just needed something to run the wires. Who knew that Bronto’s chip was that powerful? It would have cost over $2000000 dollars if he sold it, and Bronto wanted to use it to win a computer contest. It’s a shame he had to give it up for Jerry’s creation. Though it wasn’t Jerry’s idea to steal the chip. At home, the phone rang.  Mr. Jerry had to pick it up, as before Jerry’s mom was on a vacation, she told Jerry’s dad to always pickup phones, even when you’re sleeping because I might be calling.

[b](4) Two Desperate Girls[/b]

    It’s very strange to imagine how two 12 year old girls would kidnap one 12 year old boy. But for everything in life you do, there’s a reason and this reason is about two desperate girls who also want to get the principal for a day. There are 1000+ grade 7’s in Rhino school, yes 1000+ people who get tortured every day, and merely all of them are going for the principal for a day. But these two girls want it the most. Maybe Jerry wants it the most, but these girls want it even more. If not even more, they would want it as much as Jerry does. 

    “We captured you, because we were spying on you when you were working with your dad to make the robot. Looking at yours, you will obviously win. This is why we want to steal your creation and get the reward.” Sema explained. “Why do you want to be principal? I mean you already are the two most wicked people in the whole of Rhino school.” “We are. But we want everyone to obey us and inherit some of our magic and power.” Keema said. Who knew that this race would go so far?
 
    By now, you can tell how much different the school will be after the contest is over. Jerry wasn’t scared though, he had a plan. He knew that something will stop him from inventing the craziest thing ever to be invented. He would call someone. He would call Adam, the one that can rescue jerry once and for all.
 
    “Well since I worked so hard, shouldn’t I get something? Because it would be very unfair for you guys to just steal my creation and not give something back.” Jerry said. “Fine, what do you want?” Keema replied. “Maybe like some time to get myself out of this tension so I can relax?” “We will let him watch the last episode of Robotron, ok?” Sema said. The last episode of Robotron was stolen in 2009, so the company was never able to broadcast it to the public. Fans of Robotron including Jerry were crying so hard when they found out it was gone. Very weird that the wicked girls (Sema and Keema) had stolen it. Not so weird, because who else would steal an episode of the best show ever to be broadcasted? “Nah, I would rather want to call a friend or something.” Jerry said, feeling strong. “Fine, you may call a friend but you will not ask for help.” Sema said.
 
    Jerry would call the only friend he wanted to call, Adam. What would he do? Ask for help. But in a different way so that the wicked girls wouldn’t recognize. The phone bell rang at Adam’s house and woke Adam up. “Hi Adam, can you come to my house and take the grey box home?” Jerry said. What was the grey box? The robot head of course. Now Adam and Jerry have been friends for a decent amount of time. They knew how to call each other for help if they needed it. “Umm… sure?” Adam pretended to not know. And Adam did have Jerry’s house keys, so don’t be wondering how he’d come in. “Ok, thanks bye.” Jerry ended the call with no questions and doubts from Keema and Sema.
 
    “What’s the grey box?” Sema asked, suspiciously. “Oh, it’s just a big box where all my collections and valuables and gifts were. I’d suppose if I’m not going back home, my best friend could keep it.” Jerry replied, acting like there’s no need for suspicion. 





[size=15pt]Next chapter: Adam completes the robot and attaches all the wires to perfect the robot. Find out what the robot does to the wicked girls, Sema and Keema. Something also strange happens to Keema and Sema at midnight. - Be sure to stay tuned![/size]




Chapter 5 coming November 19, 2010! Be sure to continue the adventure tomorrow.</description>

<p>Sentences like this one make a good book suck instantly. It’s too much. A character has to do something, he has to solve problems. A good book is about a character solving problems and ending with a grand finale. If he has the opportunity to opt out in chapter 1, the whole story will seem unnecessary.</p>
<p>Besides, I wouldn’t mention amounts. And the word ‘over’ makes me think of ‘over 9000’, but thats my flaw.</p>

<p>Jerry (12 years old) is a boy who is extremely disappoined at Rhino school. Rhino school, the most boring school in the world, literally. Now Jerry doesn’t want to spend his years of childhood in this school. So he wants a change. The principal has announced a contest for all grade 7’s to invent something and the most creative invention will win principal for a week. Jerry can do so much in a week, and one of the things would be to fire all teachers (because all of them are boring) and change the school, but will he win? And what’s stopping him from winning? Read series one - Principal Robot to find out.</p>
<p><a>b</a> Robots Can Make You A Principal[/b]</p>
<pre><code>It was Monday morning and Jerry (Jay – ree) was way sleepier then he had been ever before. He would always be sleepy on Mondays, because he woke up at 7:30 after the weekends. It was a big pain, especially if your school had the most boring teachers ever. Like how Ms. Soprano takes over a minute to say a sentence. How Mr. Honey is worse than his students at gym. It would take hours to explain all of the teachers at Rhino school. However, Jerry had friends. Jerry had friends that hated their teachers as much as Jerry did, if not more. Adam (Jerry’s best friend) brought apples everyday to Ms. Soprano. Right now, you would think he likes Ms. Soprano, but he doesn’t. Every time he’s about to hand the apple to Ms. Soprano, he would think that it’s another chance of hitting her as hard as he can on the face.  By now, you might be thinking, why doesn’t Jerry ask his parents to move schools? And why did his parents put him in the school in the first place? Well it’s because Rhino school is where all of Jerry’s friends were and it would be a shame if he ditched them all just to go to a better, less-boring school. And his parents only keep him in this school because it’s the cheapest. Like all parents in the community, Jerry’s parents wanted to save money for their son’s college. It’s a shame that the kids never get their favorite television channels, game consoles, and their freedom. All they would get after school would be “study hard, son!” And Jerry was sick of it. He was sick of his teachers, Rhino – cheap – school, and wanted to do something about it.

After school, the class heard the afternoon announcements. Today, they were no ordinary announcements. Today, the principal held a contest for principal for a week. If it were Jerry or Adam winning, they would fire all the teachers; make the school WAY more fun for the students and staff. That was pretty much their biggest dream. But, you must invent the craziest thing in the entire school to win. Every grade 7 had to participate. This was the chance for Jerry to change his life for once.

Jerry had millions of ideas going through his brain of what to invent: A robot that does things for you, a robot that does your homework, a robot that tells you the future, and what other robots. Why robots? Because Jerry as a small boy loved the show: Robotron. It was a cartoon show about robots helping each other survive from the human race. The humans lived on Earth, and the robots lived on Cartonomia (khar- tawn – na – owh – mee- a). Scientists wanted to capture the robots as they would cost millions of dollars. But for all Jerry’s inventing ideas, he wouldn’t know how to make the robot he wants. So, he would go to the only person he believes that can make such things, his dad.

Jerry came up to his father, the father who expected more than the most from his son. “Hey dad, can you help me out with something?” Jerry asked, looking innocent so that his dad wouldn’t slap him in the face after he tells him what he wants. “Sure son, what is it?” His dad replied. His dad had an extremely deep voice. “Can you help me make a robot?” Jerry replied, very quickly so it won’t seem like he’s gone nuts. There was no need for saying it fast though, his dad would do anything for Jerry to become a doctor, engineer or a lawyer. And helping him at school was the least he could do. “Sure, what for?” Jerry couldn’t believe that his dad accepted a crazy request. Think about it say “can you make me a robot for school?” to your dad, and see if he would help you. “It’s a school assignment. Every grade 7 has to do it. It’s like for your report card for term 2.” Jerry had to lie. Else his dad would think he is too desperate for becoming principal.  And the reply was a perfect trap for making his dad help him, as passing in school was all his dad wanted for Jerry. “Let’s get to work then! I’ll need the following materials….” Jerry’s dad wasted no time and they got to work.
</code></pre>
<p><a>b</a> Power Tool Engineering[/b]</p>
<pre><code>Jerry and his dad were no engineers or power tool experts, but they were enough to make a robot! Weird to say how no one ever invented a fully working robot before, and these two non-experienced ones can do it? Well I or no one said that they can, now keep reading, reader!

After five whole days (120 hours of straight work), they finished the head. It looked extremely creepy and seemed like it would haunt you at night. Super red eyes, supposed to shoot laser, super triangle nose, supposed to flash when robot talked, and super straight-horizontal lined grey mouth, supposed to move when robot talked. Everything was a ‘supposed-to’ at this minute, but Jerry’s dad was confident to promise they will make something like a robot. “Well, you better get to bed now. It’s getting late”. It was 11:30 PM right now, when Jerry usually slept at 9:30. Suddenly, the phone rang and Mr. Jerry (Jerry’s dad) picked up.

“Hello?” “Can I speak to Jerry?” “Jerry, it’s for you!!!” “Hi Jerry, whatcha doing the project on?” It was Adam speaking. “I’m working on a robot with my dad.” “Still obsessed with robots, huh?” Adam was actually into robots too, as they were both 12 years old, Adam used to watch Robotron to. But Jerry was so loyal to Robotron; he would memorize all of the words in an episode if he had to, to watch another episode. “It was just a good idea. I mean like it’s never-done before, so I thought my dad and I could try. It’s going good, we’re done the head.” “’K, well my mom is telling me to go sleep. I’ll call you tomorrow.” “Ok bye.” “Ok Jerry, go to sleep now.” Mr. Jerry read the guide to becoming a good parent. On chapter 41 (yes, there are that many chapters), it said “make your child sleep early. They need to get their sleep for the next day.”
At night, something strange happened. Not something that would happen. Not something you consider strange, but in this case it was very strange. Jerry got kidnapped. Who did he get kidnapped by? I don’t know. I’m just the narrator, what should I know?
</code></pre>
<p><a>b</a> Kidnap[/b]</p>
<pre><code>Normally, you wouldn’t get kidnapped when you are sleeping. But it happened to Jerry. Yes, Jerry got kidnapped when he was sleeping. Strangely enough, he was still sleeping. After hours of flight on a broomstick (No, I don’t think it’s a witch) with Jerry still sleeping, they arrived at a place. This place was a lot like a haunted house. Black walls, broken roof, smashed windows, huge in size. Then, the two kidnappers revealed themselves. They were two girl witches (I was wrong, they were witches).  The girls woke Jerry up. Jerry somehow recognized the two girls and was freaking out. His mind right now, like his millions of idea for the project, was filled with millions of questions. “How did I get here? Do I know you? Where’s my dad? Did you steal my night light?” “Oh, you will find it all out very soon” The taller girl said. They brought Jerry into the house and the house turned out to be much smaller inside than it looked out. Jerry recognized this area. Yes! It was the house where he was born 12 years ago! Knowing that, Jerry found out who the girls were. They were two of the creepiest girls in the entire school named Sema (seh – mah (the tall one)) and the more wicked one, Keema (keeh- mah (the smaller but more wicked on)). They were girls who burnt their homework, loved to torture, and got suspended for 20 days for around 7 times in mid school. But it still came to Jerry’s mind, why did they kidnap him and how in the world did they inherit such magic and power?

“You should by now recognize us.” Sema said. “Yes I do, now how did you get such power?” Jerry asked curiously. “We hacked into Mr. Bronto Byte’s lab and stole microchips. Then we hacked into your house, and made your hard worked on robot head a read robot powered thing using Mr.Bronto Byte’s microchip.” Keema explained. After all, it was her idea. And yes, Mr. Bronto Byte is the school’s computer teacher, and he is named after a unit of space in computers. Jerry understood it all. They made his robot work and then made it their servant and stole all the power the robot had. How did the microchip work? The robot already had wires inside it. It just needed something to run the wires. Who knew that Bronto’s chip was that powerful? It would have cost over $2000000 dollars if he sold it, and Bronto wanted to use it to win a computer contest. It’s a shame he had to give it up for Jerry’s creation. Though it wasn’t Jerry’s idea to steal the chip. At home, the phone rang.  Mr. Jerry had to pick it up, as before Jerry’s mom was on a vacation, she told Jerry’s dad to always pickup phones, even when you’re sleeping because I might be calling.

<p><a>b</a> Two Desperate Girls[/b]</p>
<pre><code>It’s very strange to imagine how two 12 year old girls would kidnap one 12 year old boy. But for everything in life you do, there’s a reason and this reason is about two desperate girls who also want to get the principal for a day. There are 1000+ grade 7’s in Rhino school, yes 1000+ people who get tortured every day, and merely all of them are going for the principal for a day. But these two girls want it the most. Maybe Jerry wants it the most, but these girls want it even more. If not even more, they would want it as much as Jerry does. 

“We captured you, because we were spying on you when you were working with your dad to make the robot. Looking at yours, you will obviously win. This is why we want to steal your creation and get the reward.” Sema explained. “Why do you want to be principal? I mean you already are the two most wicked people in the whole of Rhino school.” “We are. But we want everyone to obey us and inherit some of our magic and power.” Keema said. Who knew that this race would go so far?

By now, you can tell how much different the school will be after the contest is over. Jerry wasn’t scared though, he had a plan. He knew that something will stop him from inventing the craziest thing ever to be invented. He would call someone. He would call Adam, the one that can rescue jerry once and for all.

“Well since I worked so hard, shouldn’t I get something? Because it would be very unfair for you guys to just steal my creation and not give something back.” Jerry said. “Fine, what do you want?” Keema replied. “Maybe like some time to get myself out of this tension so I can relax?” “We will let him watch the last episode of Robotron, ok?” Sema said. The last episode of Robotron was stolen in 2009, so the company was never able to broadcast it to the public. Fans of Robotron including Jerry were crying so hard when they found out it was gone. Very weird that the wicked girls (Sema and Keema) had stolen it. Not so weird, because who else would steal an episode of the best show ever to be broadcasted? “Nah, I would rather want to call a friend or something.” Jerry said, feeling strong. “Fine, you may call a friend but you will not ask for help.” Sema said.

Jerry would call the only friend he wanted to call, Adam. What would he do? Ask for help. But in a different way so that the wicked girls wouldn’t recognize. The phone bell rang at Adam’s house and woke Adam up. “Hi Adam, can you come to my house and take the grey box home?” Jerry said. What was the grey box? The robot head of course. Now Adam and Jerry have been friends for a decent amount of time. They knew how to call each other for help if they needed it. “Umm… sure?” Adam pretended to not know. And Adam did have Jerry’s house keys, so don’t be wondering how he’d come in. “Ok, thanks bye.” Jerry ended the call with no questions and doubts from Keema and Sema.

“What’s the grey box?” Sema asked, suspiciously. “Oh, it’s just a big box where all my collections and valuables and gifts were. I’d suppose if I’m not going back home, my best friend could keep it.” Jerry replied, acting like there’s no need for suspicion.
