    <title>Forcing a full screen app into it&#39;s own window?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/forcing-a-full-screen-app-into-its-own-window/143940</link>
    <description>So recently, I downloaded the original resident evil 1 for pc, it has 2 options for graphics:
320 x 220 FULLSCREEN
640 x 440 FULLSCREEN
Now, this doesn&#39;t bother me that it&#39;s so small, it&#39;s just, displaying 640 x 440 on a 1280 x 800 screen kinda stretches it an awful lot, so does anyone know if I can force it into it&#39;s own app? If it makes any difference, it uses DX 3c.</description>
