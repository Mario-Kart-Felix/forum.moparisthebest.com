<p>Well, most of the high street brands (Dell, HP, Alienware) generally rip you off for what you get. You can find some good online stores that sell computers at a reasonable price. Never, ever, ever buy from PC World or stores similar.</p>

<p>Don’t go with Dell. Generally, they rip you off quite badly. They have bad customer service and physically lie to you…</p>

              <p>Expect to pay more for a Desktop. Bobby, what do you intend to do on this PC? Gaming? School work? A mixture?</p>
<p>Either way I recommend custom building. It works out to be about $400 cheaper than buying from a high street retailer. I suggest:<br>
GeForce6100SM-M Mobo (You can take out the vid card that comes inbuilt with it. It’s only 256mb)<br>
1GB of RAM minimum, however you can find 2GB of RAM pretty cheap now. Also, try and find 2x 1GB RAM sticks, instead of 4x 512mb ram sticks.<br>
80+GB HD (I found a 300GB one really cheap, I’ll find the link for you.)</p>
<p>If you are going to get a graphics card, make sure you make your psu something like 500W as 300W or lower often wont handle a vid card upgrade.</p>
