    <title>[pi] a couple of questions [I STILL NEED HELP WITH THIS!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-a-couple-of-questions-i-still-need-help-with-this/372749</link>
    <description>I am just going to post all the problems i want to fix so help if you can:)
Also i have tried to fix/edit these problems but i can&#39;t so that is why i am posting.

1. when you make a fire it is invisible, and i think it has to do with these to lines of code in the firemaking class
[code]Objects fire = new Objects(2732,c.getX(),c.getY(), 0, -1, 10, 3);
Objects fire2 = new Objects(2732,c.getX(),c.getY(), 0, -1, 10, 60);[/code]
i have tried editing the numbers, commenting out lines and i cant fix it :/

2.How would i add vengeance gfx? I think this could be client sided but I am not sure, or what is the pi vengeance gfx id? if soul split came with it.

3.How can i make the prayer drain slower?

That is all for now, pleas help i will rep+ for the help and it will be greatly appreciated.</description>
