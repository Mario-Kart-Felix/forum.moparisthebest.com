    <title>Friends/ignores list limitation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/friends-ignores-list-limitation/384608</link>
    <description>So I just wrote a system for friends and ignores and updating each list on Stonefall (my server), which is built for revision 317 clients. For testing purposes I set the maximum entries for each list to try it out. Should the list exceed 5, I send the player a message saying that their list was full.

The problem is while it registers the list is full it still updates it with the new entry. I commented out my code to realise with or without server response, the client adds a new username to the list without confirmation from the server.

How have some other people gotten around this? I also found the client handles prevention of duplicate entries client-sided.


[b]Edit:[/b] I was just told in the MoparScape IRC that the client handles both duplicate entries and maximum list sizes client-side. So I guess they do not need to be implemented into the server. I don&#39;t need help on this any more. Not that I expected to get it on these forums...</description>
