    <title>Government to compensate ex-Guantanamo Bay detainees</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/government-to-compensate-ex-guantanamo-bay-detainees/368925</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Around a dozen men, who accused British security forces of colluding in their torture overseas, are to get millions in compensation from the UK government.

Some of the men, who are all British citizens or residents, were detained at the Guantamo Bay prison camp in Cuba.

At least six of them alleged UK forces were complicit in their torture before they arrived at Guantanamo.

A ministerial statement on the out-of-court settlement is due to be made in the House of Commons later on Tuesday.

It is believed the government wanted to avoid a lengthy and costly court case which would also have put the British secret intelligence services under the spotlight.
Avoiding costs

Bisher al-Rawi, Jamil el Banna, Richard Belmar, Omar Deghayes, Binyam Mohamed and Martin Mubanga were among those who had begun High Court cases against the government.

They had claimed that UK intelligence agencies and three government departments were complicit in their torture and should have prevented it.

In May, the Court of Appeal ruled that the government was unable to rely on &quot;secret evidence&quot; to defend itself against the six cases.

Then, in July, the High Court ordered the release of some of the 500,000 documents relating to the case.

BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said that around 100 intelligence officers had been working around the clock preparing legal cases.

He said the government wanted to avoid the cost of the court case, and that the terms of the settlement would remain confidential - something wanted by both the men and ministers.

He added that the Intelligence and Security Committee and the National Audit Office would be briefed about the payments.

He said the government would now be able to move forward with plans for an inquiry, led by Sir Peter Gibson, into claims that UK security services were complicit in the torture of terror suspects.

The settlement was believed to have been agreed after lengthy negotiations.

The Cabinet Office said: &quot;The prime minister set out clearly in his statement to the House (of Commons) on July 6 that we need to deal with the totally unsatisfactory situation where for &#39;the past few years, the reputation of our security services has been overshadowed by allegations about their involvement in the treatment of detainees held by other countries&#39;.&quot;

Tuesday&#39;s statement is expected to be made by Justice Secretary Ken Clarke.

The UK security services have always denied any claims that they have used or condoned the use of torture.

Last month, the head of MI6, Sir John Sawers described torture as &quot;illegal and abhorrent&quot; and defended the service&#39;s need for secrecy.

Mr Mohamed, from west London, was held in Pakistan in 2002 before US agencies moved him to Morocco, where he was severely tortured, before he was sent on to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

It later emerged that a British intelligence officer visited him in detention in Pakistan and that the CIA had told London what mistreatment he had suffered.

Mr Mohamed, 32, had alleged that his torturers in Morocco had asked questions supplied by MI5.

He was released in 2009, when allegations of British involvement in torture returned to prominence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Imo, if they were involved in ANY  Al- Qaeda activity they should be sentenced to death, but that&#39;s just my view. Should they be given compensation for being totured, even IF they had an active role in the terrorist organisation?</description>

<p>You say it yourself, it works some of the time. There’s no telling when someone is telling the truth, or he’s just trying to get the interrogator of his back. Especially in a guerrilla war, like the ones in Iraq and Afghanistan, you’ll end up picking up people at random and interrogating them. So the odds of them being guilty are low. If you know that torture only results in honest answers (which help) some of the time, you’ll be wasting a lot of time and lives.</p>
<p>Besides, if you are the one trying to propagate your system as being the better one, you better be clean as can be.</p>
<p>Albeit slightly off-topic, I’ll rant a bit about a political party that’s currently active in the Netherlands. The PVV, a right wing party, has one major issue: Muslims. They see them as the sole cause of violence and all that is bad in our country, and basically want to kick them out. Normally, you’d accept that there’s a difference in opinion and discuss that. But the thing with this party is, that in the last few weeks some of the MP’s of this party turned out to be something else they you’d expect. One is a suspect in a case of multiple threats, and prosecuted for having sex with a subordinate in the army. Another punched a bartender in the face because he didn’t give him more booze, and yet another one gave someone a headbutt. A fourth MP was the director of a company that was sentenced for misleading it’s customers. A fifth has been a suspect in a case of domestic violence, he beat up his pregnant wife. And a sixth, who was listed as a candidate but resigned before elections, waved with a gun during a rally. So over 20% of their MP’s  don’t have a clean record, how can they pretend to be better then others? Remember, most of these cases were during their career as MP.</p>

<p>I agree. The above post was bait, made by me for shits and giggles. It’s far too outlandish, even for me.</p>
<p>With that said, I obviously see the need for reliable information. I’m also educated enough to know that many police interrogations end with a non-guilty party signing a statement that implies that they are both guilty and weren’t coerced into signing said statement; the same applies to many military interrogations, with many subjects providing false information to get an interrogator off their back.</p>
<p>The problem is that it works ‘some of the time’, which is better than ‘none of the time’. And until a more reliable means of extracting information becomes available, you can count on torture and interrogation being involved for the long haul.</p>

<p>Now on the actual subject. Terrorism is the act of striking terror amongst a group/nation. The goal is not to subdue the enemy by force, but by striking the enemy’s society at it’s roots. Don’t you agree with me that you can make an analogy? The ‘terrorist’ is his own society, and by torturing him you strike him at his roots. Not only that, but you also have another goal, namely to discourage others from attacking you (subdue him)</p>

              <blockquote>Around a dozen men, who accused British security forces of colluding in their torture overseas, are to get millions in compensation from the UK government.
<p>Some of the men, who are all British citizens or residents, were detained at the Guantamo Bay prison camp in Cuba.</p>
<p>At least six of them alleged UK forces were complicit in their torture before they arrived at Guantanamo.</p>
<p>A ministerial statement on the out-of-court settlement is due to be made in the House of Commons later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It is believed the government wanted to avoid a lengthy and costly court case which would also have put the British secret intelligence services under the spotlight.<br>
Avoiding costs</p>
<p>Bisher al-Rawi, Jamil el Banna, Richard Belmar, Omar Deghayes, Binyam Mohamed and Martin Mubanga were among those who had begun High Court cases against the government.</p>
<p>They had claimed that UK intelligence agencies and three government departments were complicit in their torture and should have prevented it.</p>
<p>In May, the Court of Appeal ruled that the government was unable to rely on “secret evidence” to defend itself against the six cases.</p>
<p>Then, in July, the High Court ordered the release of some of the 500,000 documents relating to the case.</p>
<p>BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said that around 100 intelligence officers had been working around the clock preparing legal cases.</p>
<p>He said the government wanted to avoid the cost of the court case, and that the terms of the settlement would remain confidential - something wanted by both the men and ministers.<br>

<p>He added that the Intelligence and Security Committee and the National Audit Office would be briefed about the payments.</p>
<p>He said the government would now be able to move forward with plans for an inquiry, led by Sir Peter Gibson, into claims that UK security services were complicit in the torture of terror suspects.</p>
<p>The settlement was believed to have been agreed after lengthy negotiations.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Office said: “The prime minister set out clearly in his statement to the House (of Commons) on July 6 that we need to deal with the totally unsatisfactory situation where for ‘the past few years, the reputation of our security services has been overshadowed by allegations about their involvement in the treatment of detainees held by other countries’.”</p>
<p>Tuesday’s statement is expected to be made by Justice Secretary Ken Clarke.</p>
<p>The UK security services have always denied any claims that they have used or condoned the use of torture.</p>
<p>Last month, the head of MI6, Sir John Sawers described torture as “illegal and abhorrent” and defended the service’s need for secrecy.</p>
<p>Mr Mohamed, from west London, was held in Pakistan in 2002 before US agencies moved him to Morocco, where he was severely tortured, before he was sent on to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.</p>
<p>It later emerged that a British intelligence officer visited him in detention in Pakistan and that the CIA had told London what mistreatment he had suffered.</p>
<p>Mr Mohamed, 32, had alleged that his torturers in Morocco had asked questions supplied by MI5.</p>
<p>He was released in 2009, when allegations of British involvement in torture returned to prominence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imo, if they were involved in ANY  Al- Qaeda activity they should be sentenced to death, but that’s just my view. Should they be given compensation for being totured, even IF they had an active role in the terrorist organisation?</p>
