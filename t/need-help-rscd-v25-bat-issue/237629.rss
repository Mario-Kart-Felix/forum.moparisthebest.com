    <title>[Need Help] RSCD V25 .bat issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-rscd-v25-bat-issue/237629</link>
    <description>I am not sure what all files I need to configure to make the .bats launch right.... so if some one could give em a full list of all the files I need to configure please what needs to be configured that would be much appreciated. Because every time I lauch my runlserver.bat i says
[code]
Buildfile: build.xml

runls:
[java] login server starting up...
[java] connected to MySQL
[java] LoginEngine now running
[/code]

so then I launch Run_Server.bat this is what it says
[code]
Buildfile: build.xml

runserver:
[java] RSCD Server starting up...
[java] Attempting to connect to LS
[java] Attempting to connect to LS
[java] Attempting to connect to LS
[java] Attempting to connect to LS
[java] Attempting to connect to LS
[/code]

well any ways it just keep saying &quot;[java] Attempting to connect to LS&quot; and does not do any thing else does any one know where i went wrong?</description>
