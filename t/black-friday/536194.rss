    <description>Well I was at the Target opening at 8pm and I missed the 50inch led 1080p tvs going for 229.00 since they only had 10 of them (cheap bastards) I really was looking forward to the 50 inch but eh I bought (2) 40inch led 1080 for $300 each (280+tax)

At the 6pm I bought (2) 32inch led 720p tvs at WalMart for $100 each. So yea.. and I still have $1500 to spend.

I need some input on if I should return the 40inch TV&#39;s (can you guys find better deals online?) The 32inch is a steal I will be keeping those (maybe I can dual monitor both?)

Keep in mind I do not care for the company that makes the TV and never will. I am only concerned about specs and appropriate pricing. So was this the appropriate buy? Or should I return the 40inchs?</description>
