    <title>Server trouble, even though I did everything?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-trouble-even-though-i-did-everything/295524</link>
    <description>My server, it went down sometime ago because something happened and it stopped working. I couldn&#39;t figure out the problem, well 2 months later I decide to try and get something going again, new server name and IP. I thought it was going to be a walk in the park but nothings every easy. Well I got my NO-IP duc from the website, I updated my server name and kept it running. I was running my source and my client and set the clients Serverip to &quot;cubanscape.servegame.com&quot; and when I hit login it said error connecting even though I had the source running. I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with port forwarding as that only simply lets players in to my knowledge. I&#39;ve relentlessly checked and checked to see if I did anything, but I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t. I&#39;m running a Verizon Dsl, I guess with the router inside of it or w.e, I made all the ports 43594 and shut down my routers firewall to no security, I even added an exception with my firewall being &quot;43594&quot;. If someone can just easily tell me what&#39;s what or what I&#39;m doing wrong or what I forgot to do, I&#39;ll hand out some rep.</description>

              <p>Well if you still have your cd from it, then you press reset button router(usually on the bottom),then it should say your internet is unplugged. Then you put cd in and let it do it’s work.</p>
<p>Btw, don’t press reset button if you dont have the cd to your router or you will be fucked.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 15, 2009, 11:29:36 pm[/size][hr]Also about your ‘javac’ error in your other post you need to set your variables.</p>
<p>Go to control panel, system, advanced, enviorment variables, Click on new on the top not bottom.<br>
Then do this:</p>
<p>Name it “CLASSPATH” and for the “Variable Value” (only if you have JDK 6u1) put this in: CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_(your version)\bin;%CLASSPATH%;</p>
<p>Then press new again and put this:</p>
<p>Name it “PATH” and for the “Variable Value”  put this in: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_(your version)\bin</p>
<p>Once you finish that go to start,run,cmd and type javac and it should bring up a bunch of stuff about java.</p>
