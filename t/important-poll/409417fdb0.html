<p>No, you are nothing more than a joke. To be here for such a long time, and to be banned on multiple occasions just proves that you are addicted to a place that clearly has no interest in you.<br>

<p>If it’s true that Moderators here have to prove their actions, then it wouldn’t be on a personal merit.

I stuck up for the RSC community and people respected that, but oh well, that’s all in the past it doesn’t matter now. I am calling people newfags because these people ARE new to me, and are new to the community (most likely), I have been here since early 2006, which is a little bit more than 2010, okay sir? I was here when there was only ONE RSC section, and having been here for only 1 year does not make you NOT a newfag.

<p>Surely somebody would of remembered your supposed heroism if it had been true, even so doesn’t mean you didn’t break some sort of rule otherwise they wouldn’t of just banned you <span class="bbcode-b">once</span>.

<p>Really why would that have any relevance? You seem a bit hurt of the sad reality of your situation… my relevance of being here prior to a single year or more has nothing to do with your deluded view of importance on these forums.</p>

<p>Sure, I’m pointing out how deluded your thinking process is. You come back after being banned numerous times, assuming somebody is going to care, and bragging to others that you were a former mod and “oldschool” as if though it was some sort of accomplishment. Based on your actions and what you’ve told me about your life story, the conclusion still stands of you being nothing more than an deluded addict (addict in this context meaning you’re still visiting these forums even after years of constant rejection and hoping for some sort of acceptance).</p>
<p>You’re right about opinions, although in this case I’m not sharing an opinion, I’m stating fact based what <span class="bbcode-b">you’ve</span> told me.</p>
<p>Fact being: You were this and that and banned numerous times, yet still nobody cares, maybe except you.</p>
<p>The lack of care is apparent considering only one person has been able to recall you, and even then no one has treated you any better because of your “status”. Even so, if you were attempting to troll others (which was my first impression), you still failed considering it didn’t enrage anyone but yourself considering how long this has gone on. Clear enough for you?</p>

[/quote]Lol, okay, how does a newfag go about getting mod on these forums MANY years ago? You’re a newfag because you don’t recognize my name, and because I don’t recognize your name.

</aside>
<p>No, you are nothing more than a joke. To be here for such a long time, and to be banned on multiple occasions just proves that you are addicted to a place that clearly has no interest in you.<br>
[/quote]No, I am not a joke, I haven’t visted this site in over a year, so how exactly am I addicted? I came here to see if I recognized anyone and it seems that this place is being overrun by newfags such as yourself. Being banned on multiple occasions means nothing other than the fact that one mod did not like me.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If it’s true that Moderators here have to prove their actions, then it wouldn’t be on a personal merit. You either did break rules or just continually aggravated others, in which case would make sense for continual banning. As far as calling people ‘newfags’, kind of ironic considering you pop up (clearly unknown to most) who have happen to of been here for around a year.<br>
[/quote]I did not break the rules, I stuck up for the community and peoples best interests when they needed it, and when I was banned there were a few topics asking for me to be unbanned. I stuck up for the RSC community and people respected that, but oh well, that’s all in the past it doesn’t matter now. I am calling people newfags because these people ARE new to me, and are new to the community (most likely), I have been here since early 2006, which is a little bit more than 2010, okay sir? I was here when there was only ONE RSC section, and having been here for only 1 year does not make you NOT a newfag. I don’t give a shit if people who have been here for just one year don’t know me.</p>

</aside>
<p>Surely somebody would of remembered your supposed heroism if it had been true, even so doesn’t mean you didn’t break some sort of rule otherwise they wouldn’t of just banned you <span class="bbcode-b">once</span>. Regardless, they’ve made it clear that they don’t care for you or your actions, so I don’t really see why anyone should care…<br>
[/quote]Have you been on these forums actively before 2009? NO? Your opinion doesn’t matter then. No point going on with this conversation, it’s just turned into spam…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Really why would that have any relevance? You seem a bit hurt of the sad reality of your situation… my relevance of being here prior to a single year or more has nothing to do with your deluded view of importance on these forums.<br>
[/quote]What is the reality of my situation then, sir? Clearly you know everything about these forums and about me, so please explain in great details. Also, don’t you mean your lack of importance on these forums? Neg rep me all you want, doesn’t mean you’re right. Also, if my opinion doesn’t mean anything, doesn’t that also mean that your opinion of me means nothing as well, since according to you all people in this world are equal?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sure, I’m pointing out how deluded your thinking process is. You come back after being banned numerous times, assuming somebody is going to care, and bragging to others that you were a former mod and “oldschool” as if though it was some sort of accomplishment. Based on your actions and what you’ve told me about your life story, the conclusion still stands of you being nothing more than an deluded addict (addict in this context meaning you’re still visiting these forums even after years of constant rejection and hoping for some sort of acceptance).</p>
<p>You’re right about opinions, although in this case I’m not sharing an opinion, I’m stating fact based what <span class="bbcode-b">you’ve</span> told me.</p>
<p>Fact being: You were this and that and banned numerous times, yet still nobody cares, maybe except you.</p>
<p>The lack of care is apparent considering only one person has been able to recall you, and even then no one has treated you any better because of your “status”. Even so, if you were attempting to troll others (which was my first impression), you still failed considering it didn’t enrage anyone but yourself considering how long this has gone on. Clear enough for you?[/quote]I did not come back because I am “addicted”, or anything like that, I came back to see if anything had changed and if there had been any changes in the community since I stopped coming here, and I was right, it is just as dead as ever if not more. Nobody cares because there’s nobody left to care (not that I care about that anyways), because the RSC community is DEAD. Why should I care what some pseudointellectual such as yourself thinks about me when you don’t even know me? You’re right, I did not attempt to troll anyone, I just came back to check if the community was rebirthed, and it was not. I fail to see how I am mad, unless you are mad and you are trying to reflect it upon others (me)?</p>

<p>You still fail to comprehend the concept of ‘addiction’, regardless of the reason you’ve stated, you still came back. Now, if you’re wondering why I keep stating the whole ‘care’ factor, is because based on your responses, you’re aiming for some sort of reaction from your previous status in hopes somebody remembers/praises you. Just as well, you’ve contradicted yourself saying ‘Why should I care what some pseudointellectual such as yourself thinks about me’, when clearly you’ve been responsive to my posts, meaning you know why you do care, otherwise you would of discontinued this.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you weren’t so defensive (the certain caps on words, iterating the same argument, stating that you don’t care, and questioning my validity of everything gives it away ), then this wouldn’t bother you as much and we’d go our separate ways.</p>

[/quote]Lol, okay, how does a newfag go about getting mod on these forums MANY years ago? You’re a newfag because you don’t recognize my name, and because I don’t recognize your name. I’m one of the most oldschool people here, I have been here since nearly the beginning, so how exactly am I a newfag?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, you are nothing more than a joke. To be here for such a long time, and to be banned on multiple occasions just proves that you are addicted to a place that clearly has no interest in you.<br>
[/quote]No, I am not a joke, I haven’t visted this site in over a year, so how exactly am I addicted? I came here to see if I recognized anyone and it seems that this place is being overrun by newfags such as yourself. Being banned on multiple occasions means nothing other than the fact that one mod did not like me.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If it’s true that Moderators here have to prove their actions, then it wouldn’t be on a personal merit. You either did break rules or just continually aggravated others, in which case would make sense for continual banning. As far as calling people ‘newfags’, kind of ironic considering you pop up (clearly unknown to most) who have happen to of been here for around a year.<br>
[/quote]I did not break the rules, I stuck up for the community and peoples best interests when they needed it, and when I was banned there were a few topics asking for me to be unbanned. I stuck up for the RSC community and people respected that, but oh well, that’s all in the past it doesn’t matter now. I am calling people newfags because these people ARE new to me, and are new to the community (most likely), I have been here since early 2006, which is a little bit more than 2010, okay sir? I was here when there was only ONE RSC section, and having been here for only 1 year does not make you NOT a newfag. I don’t give a shit if people who have been here for just one year don’t know me.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Surely somebody would of remembered your supposed heroism if it had been true, even so doesn’t mean you didn’t break some sort of rule otherwise they wouldn’t of just banned you <span class="bbcode-b">once</span>. Regardless, they’ve made it clear that they don’t care for you or your actions, so I don’t really see why anyone should care…<br>
[/quote]Have you been on these forums actively before 2009? NO? Your opinion doesn’t matter then. No point going on with this conversation, it’s just turned into spam…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Really why would that have any relevance? You seem a bit hurt of the sad reality of your situation… my relevance of being here prior to a single year or more has nothing to do with your deluded view of importance on these forums.<br>
[/quote]What is the reality of my situation then, sir? Clearly you know everything about these forums and about me, so please explain in great details. Also, don’t you mean your lack of importance on these forums? Neg rep me all you want, doesn’t mean you’re right. Also, if my opinion doesn’t mean anything, doesn’t that also mean that your opinion of me means nothing as well, since according to you all people in this world are equal?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sure, I’m pointing out how deluded your thinking process is. You come back after being banned numerous times, assuming somebody is going to care, and bragging to others that you were a former mod and “oldschool” as if though it was some sort of accomplishment. Based on your actions and what you’ve told me about your life story, the conclusion still stands of you being nothing more than an deluded addict (addict in this context meaning you’re still visiting these forums even after years of constant rejection and hoping for some sort of acceptance).</p>
<p>You’re right about opinions, although in this case I’m not sharing an opinion, I’m stating fact based what <span class="bbcode-b">you’ve</span> told me.</p>
<p>Fact being: You were this and that and banned numerous times, yet still nobody cares, maybe except you.</p>
<p>The lack of care is apparent considering only one person has been able to recall you, and even then no one has treated you any better because of your “status”. Even so, if you were attempting to troll others (which was my first impression), you still failed considering it didn’t enrage anyone but yourself considering how long this has gone on. Clear enough for you?<br>
[/quote]I did not come back because I am “addicted”, or anything like that, I came back to see if anything had changed and if there had been any changes in the community since I stopped coming here, and I was right, it is just as dead as ever if not more. Nobody cares because there’s nobody left to care (not that I care about that anyways), because the RSC community is DEAD. Why should I care what some pseudointellectual such as yourself thinks about me when you don’t even know me? You’re right, I did not attempt to troll anyone, I just came back to check if the community was rebirthed, and it was not. I fail to see how I am mad, unless you are mad and you are trying to reflect it upon others (me)?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You still fail to comprehend the concept of ‘addiction’, regardless of the reason you’ve stated, you still came back. Now, if you’re wondering why I keep stating the whole ‘care’ factor, is because based on your responses, you’re aiming for some sort of reaction from your previous status in hopes somebody remembers/praises you. Just as well, you’ve contradicted yourself saying ‘Why should I care what some pseudointellectual such as yourself thinks about me’, when clearly you’ve been responsive to my posts, meaning you know why you do care, otherwise you would of discontinued this.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you weren’t so defensive (the certain caps on words, iterating the same argument, stating that you don’t care, and questioning my validity of everything gives it away ), then this wouldn’t bother you as much and we’d go our separate ways.[/quote]No, I did not come back for praise or rememberance, I told you, I came back here to check on how the community is thiriving, which turns out not so well. I don’t care what you think about me, I care about defending my name and honor. I don’t mind going seperate ways, and I’m honestly surprised I’m not banned yet, most times I’m banned by now. This place is REALLY dead now. Whatever, I’m done with it, I HAVE moved on from RSC so have fun with your failed dead game. Cya.</p>
