    <title>Server names messed up?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-names-messed-up/388817</link>
    <description>Okay I followed the tutorial that makes it so players can only log into your server if they are using your client (via UID). Well, for some reason when this part of the code takes place

&lt;blockquote&gt;int UID = inStream.readDWord();
            if (UID != 193851084) {
            disconnected = true;
            destruct();
                        }&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It makes it so whenever I log into the game my character name is 4 letters short and it creates a new file. For example my name is Havoc, when I login it creates a new account and my name is just &quot;c&quot; so it takes out the first 4 letters. Can someone help?</description>
