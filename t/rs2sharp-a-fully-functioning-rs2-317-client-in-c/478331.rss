    <title>RS2Sharp - A Fully Functioning RS2 317 Client in C#</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2sharp-a-fully-functioning-rs2-317-client-in-c/478331</link>
    <description>I started this project almost a week ago and just now finished it. It&#39;s an unoptimized straight port of Moparisthebest&#39;s 317 renamed deob to C#. Now I know what you&#39;re thinking, &quot;Why on earth would you do this? All you&#39;re doing is stripping it of its cross-platform compatibility and ability to run as an applet!&quot; While that may be true, I didn&#39;t intend for this to actually be used to play servers. My goal was to be able to take from it to build tools, or to even build tools straight into the client. I can&#39;t develop software with Java so this is the best option for me. I figured I would release it because it could only do people good.

Please note as I said earlier, it&#39;s unoptimized. The framerate is about 10 FPS and significantly lower than that of a Java client because of the GDI+. Loading time is slower too, but C# might be to blame (perhaps Java is actually faster than C#?!). Also none of the naming is different than the original client I used. I could have renamed stuff, but I chose not to in order to prevent other messups.

Another thing to note is some things aren&#39;t TRULY converted. For example, bytes in Java are signed while they&#39;re unsigned in C#. Some original byte types use the sbyte type, but most I just kept as a byte because their sign wasn&#39;t important. I converted some other things to use unsigned integers when trying to fix bugs I came across because I was always unsure whether or not the data types were meant to be unsigned. Those conversions were pointless but I left them in anyway :P

One last thing is a couple of the classes are mine, such as NetDrawingTools and Random. NetDrawingTools contains a bunch of methods for creating jagged arrays (and yes, I&#39;m well aware I could&#39;ve created one method and used T for the type) and converting images to pixel buffers.

Oh, and one final final thing is some of the code is disabled, like the CRC checking in OnDemandFetcher because there isn&#39;t a .NET equivalent as far as I know. Besides, nobody uses updating anyway :P

Here&#39;s a screenshot:

Here&#39;s a video (sorry, you have to view in 1080P to view the original resolution. I messed up the recording):

          <blockquote>
              <p>I started this project almost a week ago and just now finished it. It’s an unoptimized straight port of Moparisthebest’s 317 renamed deob to C#. Now I know what you’re thinking, “Why on earth would you do this? All you’re doing is stripping it of its cross-platform compatibility and ability to run as an applet!” While that may be true, I didn’t intend for this to actually be used to play servers. My goal was to be able to take from it to build tools, or to even build tools straight into the client. I can’t develop software with Java so this is the best option for me. I figured I would release it because it could only do people good.</p>
<p>Please note as I said earlier, it’s unoptimized. The framerate is about 10 FPS and significantly lower than that of a Java client because of the GDI+. Loading time is slower too, but C# might be to blame (perhaps Java is actually faster than C#?!). Also none of the naming is different than the original client I used. I could have renamed stuff, but I chose not to in order to prevent other messups.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is some things aren’t TRULY converted. For example, bytes in Java are signed while they’re unsigned in C#. Some original byte types use the sbyte type, but most I just kept as a byte because their sign wasn’t important. I converted some other things to use unsigned integers when trying to fix bugs I came across because I was always unsure whether or not the data types were meant to be unsigned. Those conversions were pointless but I left them in anyway <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>One last thing is a couple of the classes are mine, such as NetDrawingTools and Random. NetDrawingTools contains a bunch of methods for creating jagged arrays (and yes, I’m well aware I could’ve created one method and used T for the type) and converting images to pixel buffers.</p>
<p>Oh, and one final final thing is some of the code is disabled, like the CRC checking in OnDemandFetcher because there isn’t a .NET equivalent as far as I know. Besides, nobody uses updating anyway <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
