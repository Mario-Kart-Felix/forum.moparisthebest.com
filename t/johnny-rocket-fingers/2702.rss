    <title>Johnny Rocket Fingers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/johnny-rocket-fingers/2702</link>
    <description>The adventures of Johny Rocket Fingers are very enjoyable. It&#39;s a flash series made by a guy named Ryan from www.crackedanimations.com.

I beat both Johnny Rocketfingers 1 and 2, and both of them are a lot of fun!
