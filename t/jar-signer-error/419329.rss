    <title>Jar signer error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jar-signer-error/419329</link>
    <description>Whenever I jar and sign my client, I think I did it correctly, I try to open my client and it gives me a full screen white box that looks like a jared client. My client is not full screen, although I don&#39;t know if it has that capability. I have jared and signed a client before with no problems. I don&#39;t know what is going on. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</description>
