    <title>Cache downloading problems (fixed nullcache error in folder)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-downloading-problems-fixed-nullcache-error-in-folder/549487</link>
    <description>im currently having difficultly having my client is downloading the cache ffrom the link. it gets to a certain point and after its done it only downloads the main_file_cache files. heres what i have in my downloader java file and my signlink

also i would like to make it so the cache is readable from the client then it might be easyer for people to get on my server. thanks

i was able to change it to my client folder but instead of making it say cache as the folder it now says                               pvcscape\pvcscape client - BETA\locandclass\null\cache

so now im wondering how to fix the download problem and the null problem and make the cache folder look like this              pvcscape\pvcscape client - BETA\locandclass\cache

no i got it to say  pvcscape\pvcscape client - BETA\locandclass\nullcache     still cant figure out why null is there

i have figured it out after alot of trial and errors but ill put my new signlink up itll be name signlink2 so that others can see how to fix if they have the same problem.



now the only problem i have is currently downloading. i went inside the folder where the files are and selected all them and zipped it and then uploaded it then updated the link in the clientdownloader.java</description>
