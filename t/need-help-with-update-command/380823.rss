    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-update-command/380823</link>
    <description>The update command from my source doesn&#39;t work and i need help fixing it :S, have had a guy helping me code so he might have changed it from the original a bit, it didnt use to work at all, but now when i type ::update 30, in 30seconds it will just repeatidly kick me until i turned server off, and doesn&#39;t announce that theirs an update in 30secs

[code]{if(c.playerRights == 3) {
			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;update&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights == 3) {
				String[] args = playerCommand.split(&quot; &quot;);
				int a = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);
				PlayerHandler.updateSeconds = a;
				PlayerHandler.updateAnnounced = true;
				PlayerHandler.updateRunning = true;
				PlayerHandler.updateStartTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
			}
}[/code]

 
all help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks</description>
