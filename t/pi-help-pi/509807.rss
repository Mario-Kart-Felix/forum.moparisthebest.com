    <description>Hey guys, so I&#39;m trying to use uTorrent to port forward because my ISP doesn&#39;t allow me to properly port forward. So I downloaded uTorrent, went to Options &gt; Prefferences &gt; Connection and set the port to 43594, unchecked the randomize port button, checked all of the rest, and I opened up my no-ip and made sure all the ips were correct in my client. But after I tried to log in, it still say Error Connecting to Server.. What else do I need to do to make this work?</description>
