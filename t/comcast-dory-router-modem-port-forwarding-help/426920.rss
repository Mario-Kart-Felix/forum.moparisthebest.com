    <title>Comcast Dory Router/Modem port forwarding help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/comcast-dory-router-modem-port-forwarding-help/426920</link>
    <description>I have been able to portforward in the past when I had a separate Modem and router, but now I got this Dory modem/router from comcast and I can&#39;t seem to port forward correctly. I went in to the router&#39;s page and set it up all correctly but then the client wouldn&#39;t connect to the server. I set all the right IPs in the clients files and it just won&#39;t work. My brother was able to port forward for a minecraft server without any problems, but he uses ethernet and I am wireless so that might be the problem, but it has not been a problem in the past. I am using the InsidiaX source/client if that helps. Someone please help me I have teamviewer if you need it. No I am not a noob with this stuff, have been doing it for several months with RSPS and over a year with minecraft and other games, the java coding and the port forwarding.

EDIT: It is not a problem with connecting wirelessly instead of with ethernet, I tried with minecraft and it worked just fine.</description>
