    <title>I need help with combat please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-combat-please/554055</link>
    <description>Hello everyone. I am new to java and coding and rsps. I am wanting to learn from scratch and found a blank source with pretty much nothing added except for orbs. There&#39;s no skills or anything. One of the things i can&#39;t seem to figure out is the combat. When I kill any npc, it always trains the attack skill. Ranged trains range but it won&#39;t train def if long range is selected. Magic wont will only train if u manually select each spell. Autocast wont work and if you use a staff, it wont use the spell. I just need some guidance as to how to fix this. Thanks.</description>

As servers will vary with what code they have - however, most ones that came from the same base (Ex: Delta, PI) will have the most similarities (but this does not mean two servers released will be exactly identical).</p>
<p>If you’re on a 317 server, I’d assume the class would have “Combat” or “CombatAssistant” in the name.</p>

<p>ya that makes sense. I see your point there. I just figured it would be easier to have a blank source and use other sources to look off of and try to figure out how its built then make the blank one how i want it. for the combat, i think i could figure it out, i just dont know where to look. i dont know what classes and files to look in.</p>
