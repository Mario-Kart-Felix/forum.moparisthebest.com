We worked hard to get the server up and running, In Novation we want our players to have the best game experience they ever wanted and searched for! Like i said above we got a lot to offer with a great amount of custom items and a great team to support the community. We are even got a wiki that got a lot of guides to help if you are stuck with something and there is a lot of useful information to in prove your knowledge about the game. 
The staff team we got are people who are in the project since we started it all of them have a great RSPS experience and knowledge of RSPS. So with a great game and a great staff team we are happy to invite YOU to join us and get the feeling of our server, And were you want to be all day and night long to become the LEGEND of our server,
