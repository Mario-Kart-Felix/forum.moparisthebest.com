    <title>Easy 1/10. 2 tuts in 1. &quot;317&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easy-1-10-2-tuts-in-1-317/355427</link>
    <description>ok. i&#39;m doing 2 things here. 1 these are tutorials i made for my friend so he could be a basic coder. sadly he quit on me. &quot;LOL&quot; so i&#39;m looking for a new coder. &quot;not asking for one&quot; but here are 2 basic tuts i made i thought i would share.

i&#39;m pretty sure this is for 317 only. i think. not quiet sure but i made this for my 317!!! not any other.
___________________________________________________________
0= WEST | -1 = NORTH | -2 = EAST | -3 = SOUTH
these are the directions the object faces.
why is this important? if you wanted to build a castel.
you would have to have 4 sets of walls right?
one faceing, north, east, west, and south.

global objects are always found in ur...
client.java!!!
about 1/5th of the page down. hold &quot;ctrl + f&quot;
to open up a search/find box. and look for
&quot;public void NewObjects() {&quot;

so when u get to it, it will look as so.

public void NewObjects() {
	       makeGlobalObject(3509, 9496, 3831, 0, 10); // example.

&quot;quick default lesson. if u put // after something like so
*// example.* it lets you lable you objects. so you know what
they are if you ever need to delete them, its important
to keep them orginised.

                                    _________________north west east south.
                 x     y     id    ^  leave as 10.  
makeGlobalObject(3509, 9496, 3831, 0, 10);
          
and last thing. ID&#39;s &quot;3831 // example.&quot; can be found in the CLIENT. not the
source!!!!! you go 317ryanscapeclient&gt;files&gt;all_id&#39;s&gt;objects. will open
in an internet page. and there you go. find an id you like and use it.
ALWAYS. copy and paist a &quot;makeglobalobject&quot; code. then change the stuff
on it like so.

makeGlobalObject(3509, 9496, 3831, 0, 10);
makeGlobalObject(666, 666, 666, -1, 10); // example being changed.

this one will be rather long so you will have to bear with me and probley
end up reading it over and over and over again to understand it. because
its not to hard or complicated to understand, but its decently hard
for your first time doing it.

first off you really need something like &quot;teh pvserver custom p4ck v3&quot;
ill add a download link later.
all that this has in it is models, in .dat forum i think. &quot;not imporant.&quot;
unless ur makeing ur own custom items, then its important. but that
will be later, cause i don&#39;t even know how to do that really lol.
anyway.
you also need win.rar... YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. no acceptions.

after you have that. you open it and scroll over all the custom items
in it, they have 2 things in them, which are REALLY important. 
one. is...
models!!! everything in a runescape private server is a model.
but these are speical models, cause there custom made and new to the game.
adding custom items to your server, they go into you CLIENT. not source.
your CLIEEEEENTNTNTNTNTNTTTTT not sourceeeeee. remember that.
in your client you have somthing called class8.java. you open it
and scroll down a few times untill you see somthing like...

if(i == #####)&lt;--- id that you want.
{
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;; &lt;--- if you wear or use it.
class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];
class8.anIntArray160 = new int[1];
class8.anIntArray156[0] = -22464;
class8.anInt174 = 7215;
class8.anInt190 = 459;
class8.anInt204 = 138;
class8.anInt169 = 1;
class8.anInt194 = 3;
class8.anInt165 = 7218;
class8.anInt188 = 7217;
class8.anInt200 = 7219;
class8.anInt164 = 7220;
class8.anInt166 = 63;
class8.anInt173 = 120;
class8.aString170 = &quot;Void Knight Top&quot;; &lt;--- name.
class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;It&#39;s a Void Knight Top&quot;.getBytes(); &lt;--- info on it.
}

the id can ONLY RANGE. between 8,000 and 15,000 &quot;don&#39;t use &quot;,&quot; those&quot;

this is the other thing ---^ above... there called int&#39;s...
so u have to have models and ints...

when you double click on an item in the custom pack, that you want to add...
the first thing you do. when it pops up in win.rar
is extract it to... &quot;client&gt;models&quot; it may have more than one
book to extract to models. if so extract it too.

then you will have a .txt document, double click it and open it, and copy
the int&#39;s that are inside, exit it, and exit that win.rar.

open up class8.java in ur client, scroll down to the middle
and paste the ints you copyed &quot;example below&quot; like this


 hit enter behind this so watch.      ----&gt; if(i == 2520)
        {
            class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
            class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
            class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];
            class8.anIntArray160 = new int[1];
            class8.anIntArray156[0] = -22464;
            class8.anIntArray160[0] = 4550;
            class8.anInt174 = 7215;
            class8.anInt181 = 919;
            class8.anInt190 = 459;
            class8.anInt204 = 138;
            class8.anInt169 = 1;
            class8.anInt194 = 3;
            class8.anInt165 = 7218;
            class8.anInt188 = 7217;
            class8.anInt200 = 7219;
            class8.anInt164 = 7220;
            class8.anInt166 = 63;
            class8.anInt173 = 120;
            class8.aString170 = &quot;Void Knight Top&quot;;
            class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;It&#39;s a Void Knight Top&quot;.getBytes();
        }

_____________________________________________________________________________
(enter space i have entered behind the &quot;if&quot;)        
if(i == 2520)
        {
            class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
            class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
            class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];
            class8.anIntArray160 = new int[1];
            class8.anIntArray156[0] = -22464;
            class8.anIntArray160[0] = 4550;
            class8.anInt174 = 7215;
            class8.anInt181 = 919;
            class8.anInt190 = 459;
            class8.anInt204 = 138;
            class8.anInt169 = 1;
            class8.anInt194 = 3;
            class8.anInt165 = 7218;
            class8.anInt188 = 7217;
            class8.anInt200 = 7219;
            class8.anInt164 = 7220;
            class8.anInt166 = 63;
            class8.anInt173 = 120;
            class8.aString170 = &quot;Void Knight Top&quot;;
            class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;It&#39;s a Void Knight Top&quot;.getBytes();
        }

there are going to be alot of these you can use any one to enter behind.

next example on what to do.
_____________________________________________________________________________
(paist the ints you copyed here like so)
        if(i == 15000)(&lt;--- change this to 8000-15000, one thats not in use.)
        {
            class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
            class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
            class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];
            class8.anIntArray160 = new int[1];
            class8.anIntArray156[0] = -22464;
            class8.anIntArray160[0] = 4550;
            class8.anInt174 = 7215;
            class8.anInt181 = 919;
            class8.anInt190 = 459;
            class8.anInt204 = 138;
            class8.anInt169 = 1;
            class8.anInt194 = 3;
            class8.anInt165 = 7218;
            class8.anInt188 = 7217;
            class8.anInt200 = 7219;
            class8.anInt164 = 7220;
            class8.anInt166 = 63;
            class8.anInt173 = 120;
            class8.aString170 = &quot;Void Knight Top&quot;; (&lt;--- u can change name
							you want.)
            class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;It&#39;s a Void Knight Top&quot;.getBytes();
        }
        if(i == 2520) (this ones still the same. don&#39;t bother it)
        {
            class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
            class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
            class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];
            class8.anIntArray160 = new int[1];
            class8.anIntArray156[0] = -22464;
            class8.anIntArray160[0] = 4550;
            class8.anInt174 = 7215;
            class8.anInt181 = 919;
            class8.anInt190 = 459;
            class8.anInt204 = 138;
            class8.anInt169 = 1;
            class8.anInt194 = 3;
            class8.anInt165 = 7218;
            class8.anInt188 = 7217;
            class8.anInt200 = 7219;
            class8.anInt164 = 7220;
            class8.anInt166 = 63;
            class8.anInt173 = 120;
            class8.aString170 = &quot;Void Knight Top&quot;;
            class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;It&#39;s a Void Knight Top&quot;.getBytes();
        }

save. exit, and compile. now when you load, ur client up and run it
type ::pickup or ::item and the ID you used. then the item should be 
there ^^ and congrats. you now have a new custom item.

yea i know. it was quiet a bit of reading. but its all worth it ^^ if your going to be a coder. YOU LEARN NEW THINGS EVERY DAY YOU ACTULLY WORK ON YOUR SERVER. i&#39;m not expert. &gt;_&gt; by far not. but that dosn&#39;t meen you can&#39;t learn off someone. :P if you want to be a coder.
1 you have to be serious about it.
2 you really have to want to learn. sit down, try on your own. read tutorials. people are here to help you!!! for good reasons ^^. anyway.
hope you enjoyed guys. thats it for me. i&#39;m out</description>

              <p>ok. i’m doing 2 things here. 1 these are tutorials i made for my friend so he could be a basic coder. sadly he quit on me. “LOL” so i’m looking for a new coder. “not asking for one” but here are 2 basic tuts i made i thought i would share.</p>
<p>i’m pretty sure this is for 317 only. i think. not quiet sure but i made this for my 317!!! not any other.</p>
<hr>
<p>0= WEST | -1 = NORTH | -2 = EAST | -3 = SOUTH<br>
these are the directions the object faces.<br>
why is this important? if you wanted to build a castel.<br>
you would have to have 4 sets of walls right?<br>
one faceing, north, east, west, and south.</p>
<p>global objects are always found in ur…<br>
client.java!!!<br>
about 1/5th of the page down. hold “ctrl + f”<br>
to open up a search/find box. and look for<br>
“public void NewObjects() {”</p>
<p>so when u get to it, it will look as so.</p>
<p>public void NewObjects() {<br>
makeGlobalObject(3509, 9496, 3831, 0, 10); // example.</p>
<p>"quick default lesson. if u put // after something like so<br>
<em>// example.</em> it lets you lable you objects. so you know what<br>
they are if you ever need to delete them, its important<br>
to keep them orginised.</p>
<pre><code>                                _________________north west east south.
             x     y     id    ^  leave as 10.  
</code></pre>
<p>makeGlobalObject(3509, 9496, 3831, 0, 10);</p>
<p>and last thing. ID’s “3831 // example.” can be found in the CLIENT. not the<br>
source!!! you go 317ryanscapeclient&gt;files&gt;all_id’s&gt;objects. will open<br>
in an internet page. and there you go. find an id you like and use it.<br>
ALWAYS. copy and paist a “makeglobalobject” code. then change the stuff<br>
on it like so.</p>
<p>makeGlobalObject(3509, 9496, 3831, 0, 10);<br>
makeGlobalObject(666, 666, 666, -1, 10); // example being changed.</p>
<p>made by - caleb. co-owner of ryanscape-pkz!</p>
<hr>
<p>this one will be rather long so you will have to bear with me and probley<br>
end up reading it over and over and over again to understand it. because<br>
its not to hard or complicated to understand, but its decently hard<br>
for your first time doing it.</p>
<p>first off you really need something like “teh pvserver custom p4ck v3”<br>
ill add a download link later.<br>
all that this has in it is models, in .dat forum i think. “not imporant.”<br>
unless ur makeing ur own custom items, then its important. but that<br>
will be later, cause i don’t even know how to do that really lol.<br>
anyway.<br>
you also need win.rar… YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. no acceptions.</p>
<p>after you have that. you open it and scroll over all the custom items<br>
in it, they have 2 things in them, which are REALLY important.<br>
one. is…<br>
models!!! everything in a runescape private server is a model.<br>
but these are speical models, cause there custom made and new to the game.<br>
adding custom items to your server, they go into you CLIENT. not source.<br>
your CLIEEEEENTNTNTNTNTNTTTTT not sourceeeeee. remember that.<br>
in your client you have somthing called class8.java. you open it<br>
and scroll down a few times untill you see somthing like…</p>
<p>if(i == #####)&lt;— id that you want.<br>
{<br>
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];<br>
class8.aStringArray189[1] = “Wear”; &lt;— if you wear or use it.<br>
class8.anIntArray156 = new int[1];<br>
class8.anIntArray160 = new int[1];<br>
class8.anIntArray156[0] = -22464;<br>
class8.anInt174 = 7215;<br>
class8.anInt190 = 459;<br>
class8.anInt204 = 138;<br>
class8.anInt169 = 1;<br>
class8.anInt194 = 3;<br>
class8.anInt165 = 7218;<br>
class8.anInt188 = 7217;<br>
class8.anInt200 = 7219;<br>
class8.anInt164 = 7220;<br>
class8.anInt166 = 63;<br>
class8.anInt173 = 120;<br>
class8.aString170 = “Void Knight Top”; &lt;— name.<br>
class8.aByteArray178 = “It’s a Void Knight Top”.getBytes(); &lt;— info on it.<br>
}</p>
<p>the id can ONLY RANGE. between 8,000 and 15,000 “don’t use “,” those”</p>
<p>this is the other thing —^ above… there called int’s…<br>
so u have to have models and ints…</p>
<p>when you double click on an item in the custom pack, that you want to add…<br>
the first thing you do. when it pops up in win.rar<br>
is extract it to… “client&gt;models” it may have more than one<br>
book to extract to models. if so extract it too.</p>
<p>then you will have a .txt document, double click it and open it, and copy<br>
the int’s that are inside, exit it, and exit that win.rar.</p>
<p>open up class8.java in ur client, scroll down to the middle<br>
and paste the ints you copyed “example below” like this</p>
<p>hit enter behind this so watch.      ----&gt; if(i == 2520)<br>
{<br>
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];<br>

<p>there are going to be alot of these you can use any one to enter behind.</p>
<p>next example on what to do.</p>
<hr>
<p>(paist the ints you copyed here like so)<br>
if(i == 15000)(&lt;— change this to 8000-15000, one thats not in use.)<br>

you want.)<br>

<p>save. exit, and compile. now when you load, ur client up and run it<br>
type ::pickup or ::item and the ID you used. then the item should be<br>
there ^^ and congrats. you now have a new custom item.</p>
<p>made by caleb - co-owner of ryanscape-pkz!</p>
<hr>
<p>yea i know. it was quiet a bit of reading. but its all worth it ^^ if your going to be a coder. YOU LEARN NEW THINGS EVERY DAY YOU ACTULLY WORK ON YOUR SERVER. i’m not expert. &gt;_&gt; by far not. but that dosn’t meen you can’t learn off someone. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> if you want to be a coder.<br>
1 you have to be serious about it.<br>
2 you really have to want to learn. sit down, try on your own. read tutorials. people are here to help you!!! for good reasons ^^. anyway.<br>
hope you enjoyed guys. thats it for me. i’m out</p>
