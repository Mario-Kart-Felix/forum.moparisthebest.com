    <title>Two psus in conjunction</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-psus-in-conjunction/3740</link>
    <description>hah probably a pretty nooby question, but is there any way to make 2 PSU&#39;s work in conjunction with eachother? Probably not, but that would pawn so bad  :P

O and BTW, MY $1.1k system came and the psu was DOA. How much of a disappointment is that</description>

              <p>It’s possible, but the solution would probably be more expensive than buying a bigger PSU. And before anyone replies “just splice the wires” I dare them to try it first <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you want to use 2 PSUs, why not just have 1 powering the mobo+cpu, and one powering the drives? Or some other combination you can come up with to keep things even.</p>
<p>EDIT: Spelling.</p>
