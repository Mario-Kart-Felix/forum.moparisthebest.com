    <title>Joining maps in game programming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/joining-maps-in-game-programming/510782</link>
    <description>Hello, im currently developing a 2d mmorpg tile game, ive made a basic map system, and managed to get the map to scroll whilst keeping the player at the center of the screen I am however completely puzzled on how I&#39;d go about joining surrounding maps to the current map efficiently so when the player walks to the end of the current map the other one will appear without any fog similar to how runescape does it.. my maps are currently 40x40 any help or pointers in the right direction would be much appreciated :) 

If that doesnt make sense to you then here is what I mean.. 
c = current map players in
s = surrounding map
[s][s][s]
[s][c][s]
[s][s][s]
              

Thanks again</description>
