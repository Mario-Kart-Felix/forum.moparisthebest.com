    <title>Need a little help with portforwarding :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-little-help-with-portforwarding-s/267155</link>
    <description>     Hello, yes I know there is a whole tut on this very subject, But the thing is i have my server running (I can connect to it from a local port &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;) and, I am the only person that can connect, I went into my router and maid the port 43594-43594 however, I do not understand why no one else can connect.  My router brand is &quot;Intellinet, Active networking&quot;, If anyone could support me with this Mishap I would appriciate it.

     Thank you,                                               ~Sincerly~  Microsoft1.</description>
