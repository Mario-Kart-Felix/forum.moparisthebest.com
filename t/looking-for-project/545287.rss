    <title>Looking for project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-project/545287</link>
    <description>Hello I&#39;m Scott, I was the leading developer for Avarrocka during the time where the project made it&#39;s most stunning advancements. I am a professionally certified Java 7 developer and am very fluent in C++, and Python (3). I am a member of the United State&#39;s military (Navy), and have a side job which makes my availability limited but I can provide a reasonable amount of quality work to whichever project I am picked up by.

[size=14pt]Why choose me?[/size]
I can offer unparrelled server and client stability, unique features, and a laundry list of back-end improvements that will make everybody&#39;s lives easier. Here are some of my accomplishments:

[ul][li]Networking overhaul improving stability in bases like Project Insanity, and DeltaScape by over 50 times![/li]
[li]Friends list server that can be connected to via a phone application (android and iphone supported).[/li]
[li]Client support for rearranging UI layout in resizable and fullscreen modes.[/li]
[li]Precision combat and skill systems that pave the way for swift development, and quality features.[/li]
[li]Cosmetic client features like interfaces fading in and out, totally unique login screens, etc, etc ...[/li]
[li] ...  and more![/li][/ul]


Availability depends a lot on the Navy, my other job, and my personal life however, I will usually be available on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday (if all goes well). I am interested on working with people who know what they are doing because I will not be able to be in any kind of a leading roll. With that being said, think of me as a support developer. If you are interested feel free to contact me via the contact methods listed below, or through private message.
