    <description>You know the one people usually use that&#39;s under water with Neptune or something. The coords would be even better. Thanks

              <p>Getting the recipe</p>
<p>Inspect Pirate Pete, then go talk to the Lumbridge Cook. He will tell you how to get the items. You will need Ground Cod (use pestle and mortar on Raw Cod), Ground Kelp, Ground Giant Crab and Breadcrumbs (use a knife on bread). For the Ground Kelp and Ground Giant Crab, you get to go Diving!</p>
<p>Bring a fishbowl, three bronze wires, and one needle and go talk to Murphy on the dock in Port Khazard. He will ask you for the fishbowl, and give you back some equipment. Wear the helmet and diving tank.</p>
<p>Weight Limit: Make sure you are not carrying more than 27kg (check your equipment stats menu) and that you don’t have a follower or summmoning pouch with you. There is a bank deposit box near the dock where you can deposit your pet/pouches and any extra items to bring you under 27kg. However, be sure to bring the helmet and diving tank, 3 bronze wires, the needle, and whatever weapons, armour and food you need to fight the 5 level 30 mudskippers.</p>
<p>Talk to Murphy to go diving<br>
murphy</p>
<p>Diving</p>
<pre><code>Murphy drops you off at the underwater Mogre Camp. First look for green plants (Kelp) and pick one.
Go to the room to the north and talk to Nung, he will tell you to get mudskipper hides.
Go north-west and pick up the stones until you can't do it any more. Then enter the cave next to the rocks. Kill five mudskippers and pick up their hides.
Then exit the cave and go northeast to the swimming ogres. Talk to Nung and give him the hides. He needs a needle and three bronze wires. Give them to him.
Go pick five stones and enter the pen with crabs. Kill a giant crab and grab its meat.
Now that you've gotten all the ingredients, you have two choices: you can just teleport if you are standing on ground in the crab pen and can access your inventory. If you aren't, you can swim back to the anchor and climb up.
