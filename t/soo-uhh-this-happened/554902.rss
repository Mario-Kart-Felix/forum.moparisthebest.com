    <description>Lol me tinkering with packet 241:

So umm first let me explain why you shouldn&#39;t immediately delete this thread although it is kinda spammy...

This deals with packet 241 packet 241 is responsible for spawning map regions or something like that actually it seems more to me like it copies a part of a map and makes a larger map out of it which is weird because its like looking at 64x64 copy of a 8x8 tile chunk lol..

The hacking potential here is when these tiles spawn the overwrite tiles that already spawned including tile objects like normal objects and even walls theoretically you could copy a cell with banks and spawn that cell whenever you wanted (or the reward chest that lazy admin didn&#39;t bother cross checking whether the activity was really finished or it was being used at the right coords)

This also overwrites clipping removes walls if you set it to removes objects lol gf containment zones made of boxes...

But really I just wanted to show off the picture I thought it was funny..

That happened because I was attempting to make a flat grass plane and for it i wanted every tile being copied to be grass but apparently it also has to do with map spawning so... EVERYTHING IS MADE OF GRASS lol...

BTW if you want to follow the development of the server I&#39;m working on send me a pm I promise to break lots of S@#$ in hilarious ways &lt;3</description>

<p>That gif I just showed you is using the same packet as what you use to build the construction map…<br>
So, yes really. (Don’t believe me: see the progression <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=668337.200" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>)</p>

<p>Well YEA its a freaking packet to spawn maps lol! it’s about as old as runescape has had players but the function of this packet is still quite difficult to understand.<br>
And all of that is besides the point anyways I just thought the unintended effect was sort of funny…</p>
