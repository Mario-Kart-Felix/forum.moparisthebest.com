    <title>562 Client can&#39;t login, but can connect fine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-client-cant-login-but-can-connect-fine/408341</link>
    <description>Hi guys, Please give me a hand! :(

My server runs on 562 (Not sure on the server type but I think it&#39;s 562 loading 614 or 604) and for some reason the client doesn&#39;t seem to connect very well. The client loads and I can see all the worlds in the worlds list for my server but I can&#39;t connect to them through the login page. It just stops for a moment on Performing login... and says &#39;Error connecting to server&#39;. After the client connects I get a message in the server window saying &#39;Please initialize the log4j system properly&#39;, Could this be preventing clients from connecting? The port forwarding is fine I used port scanners and they detect the server just fine.

The only thing I can think of is that I didn&#39;t put my IP in the client correctly. I checked on client.java and it&#39;s correct, is there any other places it needs to be? EDIT: What about Class_a.java?

Thanks,
Gergy.
