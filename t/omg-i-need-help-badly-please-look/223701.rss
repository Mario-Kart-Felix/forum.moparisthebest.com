Can you please tell me what to do to get it online. im really confused about portfowarding, and i need someone to explain how to do everything, the “how to make a server” post is confusing and doesn’t work. could you please tell me how to portfoward? i have a linksys broadband firewall router with 4 port switch and a wireless b access point for my computer (the one im trying to host with) and when i get enough rep ill give you some if you help. Thanks[/quote]LMFAO it should take about 1 min or less to port forward. you have to port forward your ip @ <a href="http://whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://whatismyip.com</a> and port 43594 and it should work. and no its not confusing, its simple. and i cant help im busy and will be for the next week or so.</p>
