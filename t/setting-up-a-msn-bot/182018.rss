    <title>Setting up a MSN Bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-up-a-msn-bot/182018</link>
    <description>Okay i set up a msn bot today and i finished it all except one problem

I have to accept people when they try to add me therefore me having to be at the computer.. which would be pointless since its a bot..

Now i went under preferences and i found this &quot;[ ] Only people on my Allow list can see my status and send me messages&quot; i made it un-checked so people would not have to add me to chat..

Except when someone adds me it still ask the bot to accept them... and if i just ignore that they wont be able to chat with me.. How come?</description>
