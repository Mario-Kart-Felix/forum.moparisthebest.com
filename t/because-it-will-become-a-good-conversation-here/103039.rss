    <title>Because it will become a good conversation here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/because-it-will-become-a-good-conversation-here/103039</link>
    <description>It has been brought up numerous times from me and many others, the idea of a community project. In my honest opinion, everyone is absorbed in their own thing and barely care about the &quot;community&quot;. I wouldn&#39;t even go as far [i]as[/i] calling it a &quot;community&quot; considering we are all doing our own thing. A group project would bring us together and start progressing [i]finally[/i] into the future. So, let&#39;s shake off this current &quot;standstill&quot; of minimum activity and start working to make a difference, even if the difference will only affect a single person.

Your ideas on what the group project would be is highly wanted. ;)

Screw the old server idea. I like the new one suggested by Uriko.

              <p>Only problem with this is deciding on it. Not everyone is intrested in the same thing, We have some Java programs, Games, servers, and graphic ideas. Perhaps we can all kinda put them together and make a really big ‘something’ out of it. It has to be something that intrests everyone. And if its a community project it needs to be decided by the community on what it is.</p>

              <p>Stop fighting, Uriko has been posting in both the topics since they were brought up…</p>
<p>I am asuming the game will be in Java considering 1) it is the most widely used language on these forums 2) java is good for MO 3) the web design people can do what they like, make a website for it and the graphics designers can make the graphics. Simple enough.</p>
<p>Since we are starting off with a slower and smaller game, the graphics designers need nothing more than Photoshop imo.</p>

<blockquote>just some suggestion to make this 'Community Project' work.</blockquote>
I was merely suggesting that if it were to be a program, it shouldn't be open source to do the amount of leachers you'd receive in the beginning wouldn't be very good for the communities sake. As for it being a game, and being in Java, I'm not saying the game would be in Java, it could be coded in anything we would like to use. 
<p>As for the tons of programs, I was only saying that if you were to develop a game in another form of code, you’d need some excessively expensive, or large size program that maybe not alot of people would like to use.</p>
<p>I wasn’t insulting anyone, I was only saying that if a game were to be made, in another form of code, we wouldn’t have many that would be experienced in that field, and the game couldn’t be developed to it’s full extent, and therefore it would be a Half-assed game, that would have missing parts in levels, no Lighting effects, etc.</p>
<p>And don’t Criticise my suggestions, why don’t you offer some suggestions. Or maybe show some support.</p>

              <p>I’m willing to offer support in anyway possible. But just some suggestion to make this ‘Community Project’ work.</p>
<p>[ul][li]It cannot be open source, but it should be freeware. [/li]<br>
[li]It should be innovative, it should attract coders from many different areas of the internet.[/li]<br>
[li]It should be something that borders illegal, and breaks some rules, or challenges some other community.[/li]<br>
[li]It should include add-ons and have some way to allow the community later on to edit it, or add to it (Possibly some form of scripting), to eliminate competition.[/li]<br>
[li]And at all times the project should be layed out for all people to see in the community, with weekly updates maybe on monday. and have easy how to’s in it to be noob friendly and to develop better members of the community.[/li]<br>
[li]If the project itself is going to be innovative, the website, and the community based around it should be just as innovative.[/li]<br>
[li]The coders and members of the project group should have clear rankings and have a clear understanding of what they are there to do.[/li]<br>
[li]Everyone should know that their investment (i.e Sweat, time, Brain Power Possibly Money) in this Project is protected and well worth.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>There can be a future for this idea, but, it will require a lot of work, and needs a good leader, Like Moparisthebest. Which everyone in this community already has an understanding of the power he has, and respects him. To be honest, I think something different from a cheating bot or a game would be better, maybe an alternative to a Program, or a Program that does different tasks.</p>
<p>But the idea of a game, that just doesn’t seem very appealing to me, I don’t want to have to download tons of programs, or, have huge file sizes on my computer to play some low budget half-assed game. I mean, there seems like we wouldn’t have enough coders, or enough time to put fourth for a game that would be even decent.</p>
<p>If it were to be a program, it shouldn’t be done in Java, if anything, it should be Visual Basic, and have some Java Components, or something like that.</p>
