    <title>An Actual Complete Fix To Weapon Attack Speeds</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-actual-complete-fix-to-weapon-attack-speeds/79164</link>
    <description>Does it exist?

I mean, not just changing the speed in Client.java from 1 to 6, that doesn&#39;t solve the problem.

I mean, each weapon is forced to attack at that speed and can t attack quicker than the speed permits, plus it will hit again the next time without having to click attack. It really ruins Pking when 2 people come with Dharok axes and hit like 4 30s in 2 seconds.

So you can&#39;t click on someone 5 times and get 5 hits.

Ive been trying to figure it out but got no where.

Is there a released fix for this, it would really help

Thanks.</description>

              <p>Yeah, forcing the player to attack repeatly at certain times like on real rs and not just add 3 times in one second.</p>
<p>This combat issue is what makes Private Servers alot less popular than they would/should be.</p>
