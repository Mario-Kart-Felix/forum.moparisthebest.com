    <title>You do not have enough PKP for this item! [Help Please!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/you-do-not-have-enough-pkp-for-this-item-help-please/438651</link>
    <description>ok so i made an NPC that sells 5M cash for 1PkP and it all worked fine. then i made a new acc wich had 0 pkp and tried buying money, and it let me buy it and i then saw that i had -1 PKP. so thats a problem. i added some code and attempted to fix but i got errors. this is the code i have right now for it. 

if(c.pkPoints == 0); {
c.sendMessage(&quot;you don&#39;t have enough PKP!&quot;);
c.getPA().removeAllWindows();
			break;
		}
c.getItems().addItem(995,5000000);
c.pkPoints -= 1;
c.sendMessage(&quot;You Have Purchased 5M Coins for 1 PKP!&quot;);


when i compile i get this error:

src\server\model\players\packets\ClickingButtons.java:1316: error: unreachable s

                                        c.getItems().addItem(995,5000000);

can someone please tell me how to make it so if you don&#39;t have enough PKP(1 PKP) to buy 5M then it wont let you buy it!


SOLVED! all i had to change was the first line to this. if (c.pkPoints &lt;= 0) { and it compiled and works great.</description>
