    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/giving-level-80-rs-acc-to-anyone-who-does-this-for-me/410499</link>
    <description>[B]Well.. I know this is a ton, but I need someone experienced in Project Insanity to set me up a Project Insanity server.. I want Erased Pkz newest release. I will kinda customize the client to my liking then leave the source alone till we&#39;re done. I just need somebody to setup a server (and client of course) and make it into a jar and then finally a webclient. I have JarMaker, WinRaR, and a little experience in servers (I currently have a Delta, but I need someone else to set up my Project Insanity.  And before you say &quot;Get Experienced in it&quot; , I have. I have set my own up just for me.. customized it for like a whole night.. and come to find out I cannot jar it, because I get error when I open it about not having main-class:class.

I will give my RS account for it, It has like 88 wc. 70 str. 60-something attk and def. Also has quite a bit of member stuff!!

Thanks to anyone in advance~!![/B]</description>

So I gotta make the manifest file in the class or java file folder? this ones weird. it has a folder for both classes and javas.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Find a tutorial on how to use JarMaker. I won’t spoonfeed. And the ‘classes’ you are referring to are the same files as the ‘javas’ you are referring to. They are both called classes. One is just compiled, and the other is not. Please don’t refer to them that way.[/quote]</p>
<p>This is what makes newcomers hate Mopar. Everyone is stuck up and they don’t want to help other people out. Yes I know that people need to learn, but gawd. Could you be more of a dick?</p>

</aside>
<p>Find a tutorial on how to use JarMaker. I won’t spoonfeed. And the ‘classes’ you are referring to are the same files as the ‘javas’ you are referring to. They are both called classes. One is just compiled, and the other is not. Please don’t refer to them that way.</p>

I won’t accept your reward.<br>
But the problem is, “Cannot find the main-class:class”.<br>
You’re not manifesting the client to run the correct class. Fix it yourself.</p>
