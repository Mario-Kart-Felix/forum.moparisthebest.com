    <title>Playing a 474 server on a 317 client?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-a-474-server-on-a-317-client/330145</link>
    <description>Well, what i wanted to do was play a 474 server on a client that supports 317. 

but when i try log onto it, it doesn&#39;t show the player correctly. All the NPC&#39;s are there, everything is there. but it&#39;s just the player that messes up. 
I was wondering if somebody could show me how to replace the cache or whatevers neccessary to change the client to a 474? Also, i dont know but is there anything to do server sided? Thanks in advance :)</description>
