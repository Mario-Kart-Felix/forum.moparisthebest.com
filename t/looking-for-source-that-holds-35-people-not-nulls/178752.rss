              <p>Any server you find here is not going to hold more then 35+ people. Believe me, I learned that a long time ago. Try Dodian’s Uber Server or write your own server from scratch. Personally I’m making my own from scratch, and it is amazing how fast a clean well written server runs.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=6" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
<p>But again since you probably can’t do that, look for Dodian’s “source”.</p>
