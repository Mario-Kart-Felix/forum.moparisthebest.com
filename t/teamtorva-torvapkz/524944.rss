    <description>I download this clien and source package and now changed my ip in both client and source and runned the source by GUIrun.bat because the Run.bat not working as you see here 
After i changed both ip i changed the port in source and I don&#39;t know if i should change in client because i didn&#39;t find place 
But now i go into my server and &quot;Error connection to server...&quot; All work fine just idk if i have to run the run.bat or GUIrun.bat same as run.bat 
Also i portforwarded the server using Router+Torrent (If anyone can help me to check if the portforward works okay so pm and thanks ) 
So what the problem guys?</description>

              <p>I’m using the same client, source. Currently, my cache is in the C:/.</p>
<p>After, try putting either 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 in client.java in the client folder. (Search for server =)</p>
<p>Now in GUI. search for 0.0.0.0, put 127.0.0.1 or keep it as 0.0.0.0</p>
<p>Now in the source put in 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 in client (Search for server=) No space between server and =</p>
<p>Now it should be online only for you, make a copy of the client and change it to your host, or no-ip.</p>
<p>I’m sorry about the multiple options, it’s been awhile since i’ve used this.</p>
<p>If you need any help, such as developing, I will be honored to join your staff team.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>
