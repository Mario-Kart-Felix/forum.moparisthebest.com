    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/more-than-1-owner/551412</link>
    <description>So my friend and i own a rsps that we&#39;re working on and i have a lot more commands than he does and his rights are set to 2 just as mine. Is there a way to make 2 owners or a place to make him co-owner? I&#39;ve been looking how but all i can see is &quot;how to make yourself admin/owner&quot;.</description>
