    <title>317 Developer Required</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-developer-required/551269</link>
    <description>Hello everybody, 
I am making this post, as I am in search of x1 Server Developer, x1 Graphics Designer.

I currently have a VPS, and a Webhost. My Website/Forums is currently up and running, along with the server. The server is not FULLY released to the public, but is in BETA testing by some staff members, but will be released to the public later today, or tomorrow.

I am planning on having 2 servers. First being, a standard 317, Second being a Old School server.

Obviously managing 2 servers solo, is going to be quite difficult, hence why I need another Developer. 


Requirements:

- You must be good with Server Sided development (aka have decent knowledge on coding a 317), I am not worried if you lack in knowledge to do with Client Side, It&#39;s perfectly fine.
- You must take this SERIOUSLY, I am not here to fool around. I take professionalism seriously, If you want to be apart of the team, then you will be 100% DEDICATED to the Server and act professional (I&#39;m not saying that we won&#39;t have fun and mess around, but on the most part you need to show professionalism). 
- You must be willing to help whenever you are asked, unless you&#39;re occupied with soemthing more important.
- You must have skype. 
- You must be able to work with a team, be friend, nice, active, professional, and be able to accept &amp; improve on constructive criticism.

You can contact me here or my skype (owner.vyres), I would prefer skype.

Thanks.</description>
