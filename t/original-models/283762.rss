    <description>Well... the moaprscape client and silabsoft client does load the models from somewhere, but when i login on my own client... where does my client load the original rs models from? and how can i change that?

Because i have to delete all the objects that are standing in my way... to add new ones :S very annoying.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 17, 2009, 06:15:36 am[/size][hr]I think i know this, because when i use RS2 MapEditor i can choose the option to see/don&#39;t see Objects, wich means the orginal models are in the cache files. If there is any way to delete those objects by using the cache files, then please say it :)</description>
