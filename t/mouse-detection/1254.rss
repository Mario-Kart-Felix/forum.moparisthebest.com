    <title>Mouse Detection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mouse-detection/1254</link>
    <description>As most of us know, the client itself sends sends our mouse movements to the server. What most of us don&#39;t know, is how efficient this is. Many boast that they cannot record much activity because of the server space demands. WRONG. 

In one week of constant playing and diligent activity inside of runescape you may, MAY at the VERY MOST add up to 2kb of data in the log. If 2000 people do this for one week then you would consume, at the very most, 3.91 mb.  Now let&#39;s take into concideration that the average server has well over 450 gigabytes(RAID&#39;ed of course) and the fact that runescape pulls in 76 million a year for jagex and its subsideries(from both advertisements and membership). Who here actually doubts that they can log you and all of your client data from now until... whenever?

So, just as a warning, I propose we all start working on new mouse functions. If you look at the mouse logging code, you will recognize the fact that Scar&#39;s is detected. It&#39;s about as hidden as a 300 lb 4&#39;5&quot; white American trying to be an assassin ninja. Not happening.</description>

<p>What do you mean by that?  The mouse usually has to be on top of something before you click it, lmao, which means that you’d be clicking the same position your mouse is.</p>

<p>Worth a try though.</p>

<p>It does sound un-bannable, but trust me, its as detecatble as…err/…<em>thinks of something really detecatble</em>…<br>
Because Jagex monitors the way your mouse is moved, not only where it goes. They monitor things like speed, acceleration, idle time, curve, offset etc.<br>
It would maybe reduce detection slightly, but in the end it would be wasted effort.<br>
Good ideas though, its good to see you’re at least thinking <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Also-An idea Jagex looks for mouse movments that are the same (this “sameness” making our scripts more efficiant) Well, when you are training, do you not find your self sitting there talking sometimes instead of training? Maybe make a “delay” or something?</p>
