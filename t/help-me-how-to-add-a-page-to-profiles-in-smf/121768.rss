    <title>[help me] how to add a page to profiles in SMF</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-me-how-to-add-a-page-to-profiles-in-smf/121768</link>
    <description>I want to have it so I could add a page to profiles that only the admins and the user can use(to change extra settings I&#39;m adding in)

I saw about the sa allowed thing but can someone help me?

I want to add the link to the page on the left nav bar while in the profile and It would still be in the profile, but just an added page. 

I find it hard to describe even though it seems so simple

I don&#39;t need help making the page to change settings, but to just be able to add the page.
I got far enough where it recognizes that the sa is the page, but I get this, and this has absolutely nothing to do with what I am trying to do. (after having to make a serperate file for the template(dunno why, it wouldn&#39;t load it if it was in the profile template..))

&lt;blockquote&gt;Database Error

File:
Line:

Note: It appears that your database may require an upgrade. Your forum&#39;s files are currently at version SMF 1.1.3, while your database is at version 1.1.2. The above error might possibly go away if you execute the latest version of upgrade.php.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and I can&#39;t this &quot;upgrade.php&quot; in any of the forum&#39;s files.</description>
