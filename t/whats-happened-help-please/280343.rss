Yes, because you have not port forwarded and you are using the program to open the port for you. This way when you exit the program the port closes back down.</p>
<p>Do as I said before, uninstall and reinstall the program.</p>

              <p>The port 43594 is in use, tihs can be caused by another program that uses the port 43594, as you are using Utorrent this may be the case.<br>
Uninstall the program “Utorrent” and start the server again, if you do not get this problem then you obiously know that utorrent is the program effecting the ports.</p>
<p>If all goes well restart your computer and download + install Utorrent again.</p>
