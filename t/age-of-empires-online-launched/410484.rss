If you plan to play, get on the realm/server called &quot;Marathon&quot;, that&#39;s where i reside.

<p>AoE is MUCH better in my opinion. You can build anywhere and use strategy when you are attacking another army (split em and attack from both sides)</p>
<p>I think ensemble studios did a better job with AoE. The current website looks like a kids game. The AoE3 one was much more professional.<br>

You disappoint me. I can see where you’re coming from about the graphics, but it really makes me mad.</p>
<p>This game right now is taking game artists by storm, because they appreciate the art style and something like this is very very difficult to pull off and remain consistent in stylization. Its like people who think the people who made WoW were lazy, you know those textures take days-weeks to paint right?[/quote]</p>
<p>I know, but the images on the website look like something out of a veggie tales video. It’s childish. I liked the AoE3 Professional looking graphics as opposed to the kid-like graphics on the website. I know, it takes a long time to create those graphics but I don’t like them.</p>

<p>Frell, I definitely respect your point of view of this. I’m, by no means, a graphic’s artist, you’re someone who has plenty of experience. I’m not very fond of their graphics. I’m sure it takes plenty of time to do. However, I suppose a lot of people who have played previous version of the game, see this and it takes them back. This is like a different game to them, and appeals to a different audience.</p>

              <p>I have not played this game, so obviously my observations and thoughts might be a little off from what I’ve seen on gameplay.</p>
<p>It looks like nothing new, except shittier graphics. This is how my ranking goes:</p>
<p>Age of Empires 1 = 7/10 ~~ Pretty good to start with, addicting, things could be improved though.<br>
Age of Empires 2 = 10/10 ~~ Insanely addicting, couldn’t get enough of it for awhile.<br>
Age of Empires 3 = 4/10 ~~ Just didn’t feel like Age of Empires to me.<br>
Age of Mythology = 7/10 ~~ Very good, Things from temples were way too overpowered though, thus the game got boring.<br>
Age of Empires Online? = 5/10 ~~ I haven’t played the game, but since it has the same concept as AOE2 I have to put it up there a little bit. It looks like much is the same though, but now it’s “online”, but AOE2 had that lol.</p>

Take the caravans for example, the egyptian one is a camel chasing a waterskin stuck to a pole from his back, and the greek one is a donkey chasing a carrot in the same manner.</p>
