        <p>Hello, would you like to be in a development for a new upcoming MMORPG game? This will be in the base of Java, and C/C++. This is not an easy job but it is a huge opportunity to be apart of this team. We will be starting, more when we get everything Organized and ready to start. You may think to yourself, “It sounds quite interesting resting and i would like to join, But will it be successful?” With your help this can be a awesome sucsess.</p>
<h2>–<br>
Epic-Pking “562”</h2>
<p>Epic-Pking  will basicly be a free and online game for everyone. We will have Member’s and Free user’s. As we know, we cannot host 100’000’s of people on the one dedicated server so we must have several dedicated server’s with different worlds. The gaming will be HD and will be 3D to all members. Full screan mode is only for paid members. This is a hige project as you all see, we are trying our hardest to make this your game and have what you want in it! Ofcourse i will give a gift to all HF member’s who have joined. We will create a hat model with the letter’s HF on the top. This item will not be able to be traded but it can be destroyed. Also, the group’s i am in will also get a item made for there group name.</p>
<p>This is not very easy to get staff on the forum’s or the game. This is a hard earning matter, witch you must work hard to earn it. All staff members will have there own little image ingame and on the forums. This may confuse some people but we will have two forums in one website. Ofcourse we will have our Game forums will board’s, but i had some PM’S that i should open a second forum. The second forum will be a general forum with all the basic’s on it. We will have MyAward’s and Tabbed Menu on that forums. Having two forum’s sound’s awesome but it’s hard work running a game and two forums all at once so i will need some awesome help from you guy’s to manage my second forums.</p>
<p>Abit off topic there but back to the game. We will have awesome 3D monser’s with Sound’s. We will also, make some old fasion thing’s like camelot castle and have some NPC’S called King Auther and that all. This is not a game for only children this can be for people any age. We will also, have a translator that will translate everything to what language you would like. You can build your own house and have your own pet’s, but make sure you feed your pet! We cannot start this development team intill we have everyone we need. We will also love you suggestion’s but make sure this is not an other game or already in use. Basicly your living a second magical life that everytime you die you reborn. We will have skill’s you can train, we will have some commandment’s for staff. Remember, this is not a private server, this is a never seen MMORPG GAME.</p>
