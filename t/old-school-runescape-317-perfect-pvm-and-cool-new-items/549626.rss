    <description>If anyone doesn&#39;t know roxoscape was one of the top server&#39;s on moparscape in its time. And with it under new management we are working on making it better than ever. With fixed stats and making the game more fun to play and earn rares. Everyone should give it a try here is the download link.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/pcxayx8m70akz15/RoxoScape%20Client%20(2).rar?dl=0 
you will most likely need winwar to extract the files until we get it posted thank you and hope to see you on!.</description>

              <p>No, I’ve never heard of the server (which doesn’t imply that I know all the big servers) but most of the big servers had their status as gold on the status page and I haven’t seen this name in this board either.</p>
<p>Also, work on the structure of the thread. Providing a thread such as this one without even attempting to do some work with it shows a lot of laziness and gives out a bad impression. If you would take some time to throw a graphic(s) such as a logo, and then some media then perhaps people would get into it but so far this thread is horrid.</p>
