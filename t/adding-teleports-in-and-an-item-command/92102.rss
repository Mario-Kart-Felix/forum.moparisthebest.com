    <title>Adding teleports in and an ::item command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-teleports-in-and-an-item-command/92102</link>
    <description>Recently, I have tried to add both an ::item command and add teleports back into my server.  The source didn&#39;t have either and I was wondering if you could help me out.  I know there&#39;s more to just adding an item command than just adding the easy step in [if(command...etc...]Since you made WhiteScape I was wondering, how do you get teleports to work fully?  What do you have to add in?  Also the same for the ::item command.  If you could help me out, I&#39;d appreciate it.

Thanks</description>
