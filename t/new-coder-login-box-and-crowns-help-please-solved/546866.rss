    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-coder-login-box-and-crowns-help-please-solved/546866</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m fairly new to rsps coding and know very little about it, I am currently working off an 317 Allstar source with a bug fixed &quot;Stupit&#39;s blank client&quot; I have managed to do the majority of what I am wanting to do with this clients except the fact that I have no clue how to change the sprite for the Loginbox and Staff crowns, I am assuming this is client sided, I have checked the sprites folder for the normal &quot;loginbox.png&quot; and &quot;crown1.png&quot; etc but alas there is none. I am really lost with this any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks:
--Alphaa


EDIT!:
other questions I have are:
am I able to add custom items/models/animations to this client?
am I able to change the default windows border to something else?

Thanks again  :D</description>

This link should send you to Lin’s cache editor. Download it and load the clients cache with it, then you should be good from there.</p>
<p>In the question about customs, most likely you can. Search for custom tutorials and see how they are done. And for the other question, idk.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, but I’m not quite sure how to use this cache editor? I can load up the cache just fine and all its just idk what to do from there, also I get alot of errors when starting the editor exe.</p>
