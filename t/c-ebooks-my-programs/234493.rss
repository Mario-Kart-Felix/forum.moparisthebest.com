    <title>[C#] Ebooks? + my programs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-ebooks-my-programs/234493</link>
    <description>Hey guys, as some of you know I have some experience of Java, obviously I was quite shit at that. At my college I am taking a class called computing. 2 of the lessons are to do with written stuff, such as how binary works and hexadecimal etc, and the 3rd lesson is on programming in C#.

At first I was quite surprised at how similar it is to java.

My teacher is a bit stupid really, he doesn&#39;t seem to know much, and I asked him what good books he knows on c# and he said none of them because they teach bad methods (such as using ++ to increment, using += etc). 

Sure what ever but could you guys tell me some good ebooks I could have a look at to further my knowledge? I&#39;ll also post up the programs I&#39;ve had to make and hopefully you guise can tell me whats good and whats bad.


btw each program has a little discription at the top.

[b] this last one was the hardest because I finished it quick and the teacher told me to try it without using the % operator. [/b]</description>

<p>Instead of doing shit like that you could use the DateTime class, or does your teacher think that is too complicated?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yes my teacher would hate if I used something like that.[/quote]Kind of ironic, seeing as the above code has more room for error than the DateTime class would.</p>
<p>The above code will go to the else for every possible outcome other than 0.  That is horrible practice when it comes to making a commercial program.</p>
<p>What you want to do is wait until he makes a very idiotic mistake.  For example, an if statement that is like 10 blocks deep.  Then you bitch at him.</p>
<p>It’s not worth getting on his bad side over the little things.</p>
<p>But if I were you, keep programing in proper standards, even if he doesn’t like them.  The point of school is to learn, and if you are being taught incorrectly than it is not worth it.</p>

I think this too but seeing as he has 30 years programming experience, what can I say to him to make him see the error of his ways?[/quote]You don’t.  You tell a department manager or principle or sumptin’ and let him know guy fails.<br>

Yes my teacher would hate if I used something like that. Which I don’t really understand. Well I guess the newbies in my class have to learn the basics but for me it just seems like I’m wasting my time.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, as some of you know I have some experience of Java, obviously I was quite shit at that. At my college I am taking a class called computing. 2 of the lessons are to do with written stuff, such as how binary works and hexadecimal etc, and the 3rd lesson is on programming in C#.</p>
<p>At first I was quite surprised at how similar it is to java.</p>
<p>My teacher is a bit stupid really, he doesn’t seem to know much, and I asked him what good books he knows on c# and he said none of them because they teach bad methods (such as using ++ to increment, using += etc).</p>
<p>Sure what ever but could you guys tell me some good ebooks I could have a look at to further my knowledge? I’ll also post up the programs I’ve had to make and hopefully you guise can tell me whats good and whats bad.</p>
