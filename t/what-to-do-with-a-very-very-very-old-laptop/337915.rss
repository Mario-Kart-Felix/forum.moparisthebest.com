    <title>What to do with a very, very, very old laptop</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-to-do-with-a-very-very-very-old-laptop/337915</link>
    <description>Ok currently I have an old Dell Latitude CP laptop http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/pmojav/specs.htm with 128mb of ram (maxiumum) windows 2000 actually runs extremely well with a boot time of about 15 seconds and office and iexplorer are pretty fast also. The problem is....I have no use for this on an older laptop because I have a couple of new computers which do the same thing better with new software. So the question is what practical use can an old laptop be made into. I was thinking about detaching the screen and using it for something but its much more complicated than that.</description>

              <p>Well I tried Damn Small Linux, and it works (okay) a bit slower than Windows 2000 but far more useless. I don’t have internet and the browser takes forever to load. Windows 2000 browser would load instant and I had Office 2003 but now im screwed. So instead I just used nLite to strip down Xp and im going to try installing it.</p>

<p>Run an emulator, hook it up to the tv? No, no, no, no. You run an emulator on it, build simple joystick/parrallel adapter for one, put it in a case.</p>
