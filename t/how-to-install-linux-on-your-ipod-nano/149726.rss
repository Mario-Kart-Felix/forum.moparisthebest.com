To start, I&#39;ll kill all of you worries here!

[i]&quot;It is impossible to permanently damage your iPod by installing iPod Linux!&quot;[/i] 

Also, please make a note that this tutorial is meant for the iPod Nano. You may get success with this tutorial using another iPod, but I can&#39;t guarantee it.


If you have an iPod Video, there&#39;s a nice tutorial [url=http://ipodlinux.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26543][b]Here[/b][/url], and if you have an iPod Mini, you can find a tutorial [url=http://ipodlinux.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6099][b]Here[/b][/url]. If you have an iPod not listed here, just search the forums or ask someone.


Ok, let&#39;s get started 

Note: If you don&#39;t already have Winzip, get it [url=http://www.winzip.com][b]Here[/b][/url] (You probably have it already, so only download this if you have a problem Extracting files)

1) Grab your iPod! 

2) Open iTunes, which should be on your desktop or in the start menu. If you don&#39;t have it, grab the disc that came with your iPod and install it, or download the latest version [url=http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/][b]Here[/b][/url] 
(PM me if you need more explanation) 

Note: Make sure you have iPod Software Version 1.3.1, PM me for more help.


3) Once iTunes is open, plug in your iPod using your cable. Your iPod should pop-up, and click it in the source list. 
(PM me for extra help) 

4) Enable disk use, which is done by clicking &quot;Enable Disk Use&quot;. Once this is done, hit apply. 

5) Note: from now on, you MUST hit the eject button next to the iPod every time you want to unplug it, but wait until it is done updating of course! Unplug it when the screen on your iPod stops saying &quot;Do Not Disconnect&quot;. BUT DON&#39;T UNPLUG IT NOW!  

6) Hit &quot;Restore&quot; and relax when it says it will restore your iPod to factory settings. This is ok! Here&#39;s what will happen. First, it will reset your settings and take all the music off of your iPod. Next, you will install iPod Linux. After that, the music will get put back on, so make sure all of your music is stored on your computer. So basically, your ipod will be EXACTLY the same except for iPod Linux, which is only accessed if you choose so. As a matter of fact, if you don&#39;t go into Linux on your iPod, it&#39;s like it didn&#39;t ever get installed. Hit &quot;Ok&quot; when the next message pops up, and wait until your iPod is restored. When it is, it will ask for the name of the iPod. Hit &quot;Cancel&quot;. 

5) EXIT out of iTunes, and open My Computer. It is usually on your desktop, though sometimes it is in the start menu. Select it, and somewhere there it should say &quot;IPOD&quot;. 

6) If it is there, then continue on. If not, go back to step 4, and do it again. If it doesn&#39;t work, come to me for help.  

7) Download [url=http://www.josh.sys-techs.com/installer/ipodlinux-installer-2.2w-netless-20060709.zip][b]This[/b][/url], it is the official Linux Installer, but a different version. 

8 ) Hit &quot;Save&quot; and save it on your Desktop. Wait for it to download, and then come back here. 

9) Right-click the file you downloaded, and hit &quot;Extract All&quot;. Hit next, let the bar load, then hit next and then finish. The file should pop-up. Exit out of the file. 

10) Time to install! Open the file again and double click on installer. It should pop-up, and hit next. There SHOULD be a Sysinfo error. This is a good thing! Well, not good, but we can fix it! If it says it couldn&#39;t find anything that looked like an iPod, PM me for help. Ok, now for a little harder part. Close everything except this tutorial, and open &quot;My Computer&quot;. Double click on your iPod. You are now in the iPod&#39;s root. (Make sure you are exited out of iTunes but did not unplug your iPod or eject it). 

11) Now that you are in the root, hit &quot;Tools&quot; at the top of the browser. Hit &quot;Folder Options&quot; and a screen should pop-up. 

12) Hit &quot;View&quot; at the top of this pop-up, and a new screen should pop-up! 
Scroll down, and hit &quot;Show hidden files and folders&quot;. Hit &quot;Ok&quot; at the bottom of the screen and go back to your iPod. Open it up, and you are in the root again. 

13) New folder! Do you see &quot;iPod_Control&quot;? If you do then good, if now, repeat steps 11 and 12. If it still doesn&#39;t work, come to me for help. If it does, then double-click on &quot;iPod_Control&quot;. Once inside, it should have more folders. Double click on &quot;Device&quot;. Once inside, there should be a file called &quot;SysInfo&quot;. Right click on this file and hit &quot;Open&quot;. Select the program &quot;Notepad&quot; from the list and hit ok. A screen should pop-up with nothing on it. Copy and paste this in there, replace the &quot;Serial Number Here&quot; with the serial number on the back of your iPod, and then save it and exit. 

Copy and Paste this: 

BoardHwName: iPod M25 
pszSerialNumber: SERIAL NUMBER GOES HERE 
ModelNumStr: MA147 
FirewireGuid: 0x000A2700148EDA63 
HddFirmwareRev: BU011A 
RegionCode: LL(0x0001) 
PolicyFlags: 0x00000002 
buildID: 0x06008000 (6.0) 
visibleBuildID: 0x01008000 (1.0) 
boardHwRev: 0x00000000 (0.0 0) 
boardHwSwInterfaceRev: 0x000C0005 (0.0.11 5) 
bootLoaderImageRev: 0x00000000 (0.0 0)

osImageRev: 0x00000000 (0.0 0) 
iPodFamily: 0x00000000 
updaterFamily: 0x00000000 

14) Ok, exit out of everything except this tutorial, and go back into the installer (the thing you downloaded) and hit &quot;Installer&quot; again. 

15) Hit &quot;Next&quot;, and it should say &quot;We have detected a Nano&quot; blah blah blah blah. Hit next. 

16) Uncheck &quot;Make A Backup&quot; at the bottom of the screen and hit next. 

17) Then, it should install. This takes awhile, so you can leave if you want. 

18 ) After awhile, it should pop-up a congradulations message. If it pops up a Windows error, then PM me for help. Hit &quot;Finish&quot;. 

19) iPod Linux is now installed on your iPod! Open up iTunes again, and the same screen should pop-up. Enter the iPod&#39;s name, yada yada, and it should put all of your music on there. Once it is done, select your iPod in the list again, and &quot;Enable Disk Use&quot;, once again. 

20) You now have iPod Linux installed! 

21) Hit the eject button next to your iPod in the source list and when your iPod&#39;s screen stops saying &quot;Do Not Disconnect&quot; then disconnect it. It should have you select a language, and your iPod will be back to normal. Where&#39;s the Linux? First, go into your music and play 1 song to make sure it works. If it doesn&#39;t then come to me and I will fix it. If it works, then stop the song and hold down the &quot;Menu&quot; and &quot;Center&quot; button at the same time. Nothing should happen for a second, but then your iPod should black out. When a silver apple appears, hold rewind. When a bunch of text comes up, release &quot;Rewind&quot;. It should pause for a second, and then go to a new menu. Hold &quot;Menu&quot; for a second and the backlight should turn on. You can change its timer in &quot;Settings&quot;. Go into &quot;Extras&quot; and have some fun in there. Once your done, go to the main screen and hit &quot;Power&quot; then &quot;Reboot Ipod&quot; then &quot;Absolutely&quot; and it will go back to your normal iPod. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux Troubleshooting

&quot;When I select &quot;Reboot iPod&quot; it boots right back into iPod Linux!&quot;

It&#39;s important that when the iPod is rebooting that you don&#39;t touch ANYTHING! Like, don&#39;t even look at it!  :D Well, while you can look at it, it is possible to boot into Linux just by breathing on the click-wheel.

iDoom Tutorial: 

Note: You MAY need to fix the VT Switching to get this to work.
PM me for help.

1) Download [url=http://files.filefront.com//;5996769;;/][b]This[/b][/url] 

If you need extra help, PM me 

2) Extract this to the root of your iPod (remember this from before?) If not, PM me. 

3) Take all the folders you extracted and put them in a new folder called &quot;iDoom&quot; 

4) Sync your iPod (update on earlier versions) and then eject it. 

5) Boot iPod Linux, and hit &quot;File Browser&quot; 

6) Go into &quot;iPod_Control&quot; 

7) Hit &quot;Parent Directory&quot; 

8 ) Select the &quot;iDoom&quot; folder 

9) Go inside it, and hit &quot;iDoom&quot; not &quot;iDoom.cfg&quot;, etc. 

Note: My way of getting into iDoom (through iPod_Control) is my way to get to &quot;iDoom&quot; even though not many people do it that way. If it doesn&#39;t work, get to it through &quot;hp&quot; in the file browser menu. 

iDoom Troubleshooting

Problem: A stream of code comes down, and then it goes back to the File Browser!

Answer: Reboot, Click &quot;Power&quot; in the main Podzilla menu and hit &quot;Reboot iPod&quot;

7) When the next screen pops-up, pull down the drop down menu at the top of the window and select &quot;Doom&quot;.

8 ) Hit &quot;Ok&quot; and ignore the IWAD error messages

9) Edit your map, just toy around to get the feel for Doom Builder, try starting off by adding or editing some items.

10) When you&#39;re done editing, hit &quot;Save&quot; and ignore the IWAD error messages.

11) On the Desktop, your edited .wad as well as a backup file should be there.

12) Delete the backup file

13) Plug in your iPod, and go into the root

14) Replace your current .wad in the folder &quot;iDoom&quot; with the one you just edited.

15) Boot into iPod Linux, go into &quot;hp&quot; and then select the folder &quot;iDoom&quot;

Converting Your Own Videos:

As you may have learned from the previous section of the tutorial, iPod Linux can play compressed .mvpd files.

1) Plug in your iPod, and make sure Disk Mode is enabled, and minimize iTunes

2) Download [url=http://www.consumption.net/user/greeze/ccount/click.php?id=19][b]This[/b][/url]

And [url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en][b]This[/b][/url]

3) Install both!

4) Once this is done, open Smoovepod

5) Drag your own videos into the bars (it supports almost all formats)

6) In the upper left corner, hit &quot;Presets&quot; then iPod Nano - Movie, or TV Shows, whatever you&#39;re converting.

7) For more advanced options, don&#39;t use the &quot;Presets&quot; button

8 ) Drag the slide bar to the left for smaller file size, or to the right for better quality, whatever you drag this to effects your video quality and size.

9) Hit &quot;Start Encoding&quot;

10) Once it is done, it will export your video to either your Desktop, or where-ever you dragged your video from.

11) Now change the name to &quot;nano&quot; (required)

12) Drag it into your iPod&#39;s root, and enjoy.

Note: You only need to change the name to Nano if you have the older version of mv_player. (If you followed this tutorial, you did)

Troubleshooting For Converting Videos

Problem: It won&#39;t convert no matter what I do!

Answer: iTunes videos, and certain format video files can&#39;t be converted. If all else fails... make sure you have the NET 2.0 framework and re-install Smoovepod.

              <hr>
<p>To start, I’ll kill all of you worries here!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">“It is impossible to permanently damage your iPod by installing iPod Linux!”</span></p>
<p>Also, please make a note that this tutorial is meant for the iPod Nano. You may get success with this tutorial using another iPod, but I can’t guarantee it.</p>
<p>If you have an iPod Video, there’s a nice tutorial <a href="http://ipodlinux.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=26543" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">Here</span></a>, and if you have an iPod Mini, you can find a tutorial <a href="http://ipodlinux.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6099" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">Here</span></a>. If you have an iPod not listed here, just search the forums or ask someone.</p>
<p>Ok, let’s get started</p>
<p>Note: If you don’t already have Winzip, get it <a href="http://www.winzip.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">Here</span></a> (You probably have it already, so only download this if you have a problem Extracting files)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Grab your iPod!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open iTunes, which should be on your desktop or in the start menu. If you don’t have it, grab the disc that came with your iPod and install it, or download the latest version <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">Here</span></a><br>
(PM me if you need more explanation)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Make sure you have iPod Software Version 1.3.1, PM me for more help.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Once iTunes is open, plug in your iPod using your cable. Your iPod should pop-up, and click it in the source list.<br>
(PM me for extra help)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable disk use, which is done by clicking “Enable Disk Use”. Once this is done, hit apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note: from now on, you MUST hit the eject button next to the iPod every time you want to unplug it, but wait until it is done updating of course! Unplug it when the screen on your iPod stops saying “Do Not Disconnect”. BUT DON’T UNPLUG IT NOW!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit “Restore” and relax when it says it will restore your iPod to factory settings. This is ok! Here’s what will happen. First, it will reset your settings and take all the music off of your iPod. Next, you will install iPod Linux. After that, the music will get put back on, so make sure all of your music is stored on your computer. So basically, your ipod will be EXACTLY the same except for iPod Linux, which is only accessed if you choose so. As a matter of fact, if you don’t go into Linux on your iPod, it’s like it didn’t ever get installed. Hit “Ok” when the next message pops up, and wait until your iPod is restored. When it is, it will ask for the name of the iPod. Hit “Cancel”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EXIT out of iTunes, and open My Computer. It is usually on your desktop, though sometimes it is in the start menu. Select it, and somewhere there it should say “IPOD”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is there, then continue on. If not, go back to step 4, and do it again. If it doesn’t work, come to me for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download <a href="http://www.josh.sys-techs.com/installer/ipodlinux-installer-2.2w-netless-20060709.zip" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">This</span></a>, it is the official Linux Installer, but a different version.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>8 ) Hit “Save” and save it on your Desktop. Wait for it to download, and then come back here.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>Right-click the file you downloaded, and hit “Extract All”. Hit next, let the bar load, then hit next and then finish. The file should pop-up. Exit out of the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time to install! Open the file again and double click on installer. It should pop-up, and hit next. There SHOULD be a Sysinfo error. This is a good thing! Well, not good, but we can fix it! If it says it couldn’t find anything that looked like an iPod, PM me for help. Ok, now for a little harder part. Close everything except this tutorial, and open “My Computer”. Double click on your iPod. You are now in the iPod’s root. (Make sure you are exited out of iTunes but did not unplug your iPod or eject it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that you are in the root, hit “Tools” at the top of the browser. Hit “Folder Options” and a screen should pop-up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit “View” at the top of this pop-up, and a new screen should pop-up!<br>
Scroll down, and hit “Show hidden files and folders”. Hit “Ok” at the bottom of the screen and go back to your iPod. Open it up, and you are in the root again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New folder! Do you see “iPod_Control”? If you do then good, if now, repeat steps 11 and 12. If it still doesn’t work, come to me for help. If it does, then double-click on “iPod_Control”. Once inside, it should have more folders. Double click on “Device”. Once inside, there should be a file called “SysInfo”. Right click on this file and hit “Open”. Select the program “Notepad” from the list and hit ok. A screen should pop-up with nothing on it. Copy and paste this in there, replace the “Serial Number Here” with the serial number on the back of your iPod, and then save it and exit.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Copy and Paste this:</p>

<li>
<p>Ok, exit out of everything except this tutorial, and go back into the installer (the thing you downloaded) and hit “Installer” again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit “Next”, and it should say “We have detected a Nano” blah blah blah blah. Hit next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncheck “Make A Backup” at the bottom of the screen and hit next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, it should install. This takes awhile, so you can leave if you want.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>18 ) After awhile, it should pop-up a congradulations message. If it pops up a Windows error, then PM me for help. Hit “Finish”.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>
<p>iPod Linux is now installed on your iPod! Open up iTunes again, and the same screen should pop-up. Enter the iPod’s name, yada yada, and it should put all of your music on there. Once it is done, select your iPod in the list again, and “Enable Disk Use”, once again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You now have iPod Linux installed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit the eject button next to your iPod in the source list and when your iPod’s screen stops saying “Do Not Disconnect” then disconnect it. It should have you select a language, and your iPod will be back to normal. Where’s the Linux? First, go into your music and play 1 song to make sure it works. If it doesn’t then come to me and I will fix it. If it works, then stop the song and hold down the “Menu” and “Center” button at the same time. Nothing should happen for a second, but then your iPod should black out. When a silver apple appears, hold rewind. When a bunch of text comes up, release “Rewind”. It should pause for a second, and then go to a new menu. Hold “Menu” for a second and the backlight should turn on. You can change its timer in “Settings”. Go into “Extras” and have some fun in there. Once your done, go to the main screen and hit “Power” then “Reboot Ipod” then “Absolutely” and it will go back to your normal iPod.</p>

<p>Linux Troubleshooting</p>
<p>“When I select “Reboot iPod” it boots right back into iPod Linux!”</p>
<h2>It’s important that when the iPod is rebooting that you don’t touch ANYTHING! Like, don’t even look at it!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Well, while you can look at it, it is possible to boot into Linux just by breathing on the click-wheel.</h2>
<p>iDoom Tutorial:</p>

<p>Troubleshooting For Converting Videos</p>
<p>Problem: It won’t convert no matter what I do!</p>
<h2>Answer: iTunes videos, and certain format video files can’t be converted. If all else fails… make sure you have the NET 2.0 framework and re-install Smoovepod.</h2>
