    <description>Hi lol,

Is programming simple calculation programs (ie, quadratic formula, logs, etc) on a TI84 on final examinations allowed?

I showed my friend a few simple programs and then he was like. CHEATER GTFO.

Yet if they did not want to allow the use of programs on the exams they wouldn&#39;t let us use calculators in the first place.

So they clear all memory beforehand. That sucks for everyone.. except the programmers (and the people with photographic memory and can remember complex commands on the calculator and how to remake them in two minutes).

I&#39;m taking Algebra II this year, and then IB Math SL for the next two years.

I have yet to ask my teachers about this since I don&#39;t remember a rule about &quot;no programming your own programs&quot;, only &quot;your memory will be reset beforehand, so don&#39;t even try&quot;. They give us the formulas anyway. But what is the policy in your school? What&#39;s the general consensus on this?</description>

The thing is, there’s no point whatsoever because you are expected to show all your working on the exam anyway to gain marks, so if you “cheat”, you’re just cheating yourself out of the marks which is just plain retarded.</p>
<p>What are you even finding so difficult that requires you to use a program anyway. The only actual “special” functions I use on my calculator is sketching graphs and recursion/iterative things. Mainly its just basic functions and operators stuck together.[/quote]<br>

              <p>If you really want to sneak one by, you should be able to just archive the program to save it from being wiped.  Though, it depends on how they’re clearing it.</p>

              <p>Well I don’t know anything about the American school system but in tea-drinking country they say: “Your graphical calculators will be reset as you enter the exam”, but in reality it never happens. The thing is, there’s no point whatsoever because you are expected to show all your working on the exam anyway to gain marks, so if you “cheat”, you’re just cheating yourself out of the marks which is just plain retarded.</p>
<p>What are you even finding so difficult that requires you to use a program anyway. The only actual “special” functions I use on my calculator is sketching graphs and recursion/iterative things. Mainly its just basic functions and operators stuck together.</p>

              <p>Hi lol,</p>
<p>Is programming simple calculation programs (ie, quadratic formula, logs, etc) on a TI84 on final examinations allowed?</p>
<p>I showed my friend a few simple programs and then he was like. CHEATER GTFO.</p>
<p>Yet if they did not want to allow the use of programs on the exams they wouldn’t let us use calculators in the first place.</p>
<p>So they clear all memory beforehand. That sucks for everyone… except the programmers (and the people with photographic memory and can remember complex commands on the calculator and how to remake them in two minutes).</p>
<p>I’m taking Algebra II this year, and then IB Math SL for the next two years.</p>
<p>I have yet to ask my teachers about this since I don’t remember a rule about “no programming your own programs”, only “your memory will be reset beforehand, so don’t even try”. They give us the formulas anyway. But what is the policy in your school? What’s the general consensus on this?</p>
