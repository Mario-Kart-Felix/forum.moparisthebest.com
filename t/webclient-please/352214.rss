    <title>Webclient Please?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-please/352214</link>
    <description>Hey guys!
I really need help with my webclient!

If you could create my Webclient for me that would be highly appreciated and you will become a Admin on my server and I&#39;ll rep++ you!
This is my client files: http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/19/2918618//Capescape Owners.rar

I have followed many tutorials but they just won&#39;t work for me!
It says the cache can&#39;t be downloaded!

By the way if you can&#39;t be bothered taking your time and helping me then the least you could do is
tell me step by step how to make one other than making me one for me.
If that actually works you will have the same rewards as making me one.

Thanks for much guys!
Don&#39;t forget this is the client&#39;s link for download:http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/19/2918618//Capescape Owners.rar

If you could make a webs.com website with the webclient in it that would be so awesome because
I just don&#39;t know how to do that also!

Thanks http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/7/19/2918618//Capescape Owners.rar
