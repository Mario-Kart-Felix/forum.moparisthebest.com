    <title>Planet X | Going To Change RSPS</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/planet-x-going-to-change-rsps/549489</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;d like to introduce myself as X.
I used to be big in the rsps industry before I quit.
I owned 1 Major RSPS, and 2 moderate ones.
I&#39;m launching a project called Planet X, I&#39;m going to try to change RSPS in several ways with it.
I&#39;m going to try to attract new players with new content, features, gameplay, skills, items, everything you could think of. But not just to Planet x, but to the RSPS community itself.
I&#39;m trying to gather a small group of committed people / programmers / web developers whatever to help me make this happen. I can do this all alone I have all the knowledge needed, but I figured with a team it&#39;d be more commutative, with the RSPS community, and the servers players of course! I&#39;m willing to teach anyone if their interested with anything their interested in if they don&#39;t have the knowledge already or need help with it. We&#39;ll have to constantly progress though. I do have patience and am willing to spend time as long as their really committed to the position. Please contact me back if interested, or want more info. Thanks!</description>

              <p>Forsure, but that’s because everyone leech’s everyones shit.<br>
No new content is added, very few actually know and understand the programming languages.<br>
If RSPS is to have a comeback, theirs going to have to be BIG things that are new and awesome.<br>
Like original ideas, not just based off RuneScape. And most of all rsps’s aren’t challenging.<br>
Take someone for example, the classic Zezima, he was 99 everything on REAL RS. If he were to play a private server.<br>
It’d be nothing… And there’d be no competition.</p>
