    <description>[center][b]Parker` Development(s).[/b][/center]

[b]First of all[/b] i would like to say this is my first project on moparscape, so far i have only been to one ther site, in which i am now banned (for a stupid accusation a moderator made against me). Hopefully i can show you guys what i can do and maybe release my developments for other users [b]or[/b] if requested put the server online a VPS

[size=12pt]VPS and HOST.[/size]
So far I&#39;m really struggling with the money, if anyone has a free website host and/or a VPS please contact me.

If you are willing so donate a little amount of cash please click here;

[b]History.[/b]
I have only been programming private servers for little over two months now, with college and work studies i am not able to be online and working with private servers. Although when i was 14 i started to learn HTML and php, hopefully this can help me build a private server myself one day. But as for now i will only be developing.

[b]My aim.[/b]
My current aim is to have a good private server up and running, but like always this is everyone&#39;s aim. Therefore i will be trying to improve the little problems within private servers at the moment (There are many) but this will be done within no time :)
I am also hopeing to have a full website and forum up and running within the next few days, if possible i will only be allowing certain members of this forum to access mine. But this will be requested by a high member of staff.

[b]The server[/b]
Mostly every server i see has got about 20+ staff nowadays, if my server is going to be hosted i will [b]not[/b] let this happen. Everyone will have to earn their roll in the moderation rank.

The game play is hopefully ging to be split into three servers, although you can do the same on everyone of them. Each &quot;world&quot; will have different rolls.

Server 1 - Free play
Server 2 - Player killing
Server 3 - Gold farm

The server will not be easy to gain levels, items or gold. I am trying to build a good economy server and hopefully build off that.

[b]THIS IS ALL FOR NOW, CAN&#39;T FIND BATTERY LEAD AND MY LAPTOP IS DEAD.[/b]
