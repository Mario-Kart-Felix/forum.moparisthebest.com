    <description>I started adding this shop and thought I did everything right but then in game it comes saying &quot;currently cost &quot;number&quot;  tokens&quot; and right under that is says &quot;currently cost &quot;number&quot; coins&quot;.....how do I fix this?  This is the only shop I think does it since in the code under this shows 2 shops the second shop is not in game...&quot;MyShopID == 34&quot; is the shop I&#39;m trying to fix..here is the code
[code]
					if (MyShopID == 8 || MyShopID == 34) {
            sM(getItemName(removeID)+&quot;: currently costs &quot;+ShopValue+&quot; tokens&quot;+ShopAdd);
					}
					if ( MyShopID == 35 || MyShopID == 19 || MyShopID == 18 || MyShopID == 1) {
            sM(getItemName(removeID)+&quot;: currently costs &quot;+ShopValue+&quot; points&quot;+ShopAdd);
                                        } else {
            sM(getItemName(removeID)+&quot;: currently costs &quot;+ShopValue+&quot; coins&quot;+ShopAdd);
                                        }[/code]
how do I fix this?</description>
