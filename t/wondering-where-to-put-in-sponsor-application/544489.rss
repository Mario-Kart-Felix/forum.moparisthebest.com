    <title>Wondering where to put in sponsor application?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wondering-where-to-put-in-sponsor-application/544489</link>
    <description>Hello all! I am wondering where I put my server application so I may be approved to bid on the sponsored list, I know it&#39;s a day before they check applications, But I have no idea where to post it! I am planning to bid somewhere around $150-175 USD.

IP: vxrevival.no-ip.biz
Port: 43594
Forums or website, if any: http://voltagex.net

1.  Do you sell anything on your server for real world or real runescape money or items?  Such as items, levels, or mod or admin positions? Please state (generally) what you sell. 
At VoltageX we don&#39;t sell items per say, you help out the server, we&#39;ll help you out with some donation items haha

2.  What client version do you use? 317 or what?
317

3. Do you offer an unsigned client people can use?
Yes

4. Do you require people to use your client?
Yes or InsanityX client

5. Do you allow people to use the moparscape client on your server?
Never tried

6. How much will you be willing to pay monthly through paypal? (minimum is $30, must go in increments of $5 up from there)
$175

7. Do you accept donations?  If so, what do you accept as donations?
PayPal Only so far

Add any other info you feel relevant down here:</description>

              <p>Well, the question on where to put it is fine. But you shouldn’t include it here. And just money can’t buy you a spot. If your server uses  a 3rd party application like No-IP that masks your IP, you should be immediately declined. Also, the redirection no-ip.biz was ceased by Microsoft.</p>
