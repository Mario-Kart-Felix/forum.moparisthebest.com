This sort of thinking is kinda harmful.  He could legitimately be interested in learning how to program in Java, and while using RSClassic server code for this is a pretty bad idea due to the poor quality of server code in general surrounding this community, he could learn a thing or two in the process, and maybe move on to better things from there.</p>
<p>OP, your question is incredibly vague.  We need more information over what it is you want to know and what it is that you’re trying to do.</p>

<p>We all didn’t know shit about the client at 1 point or another.</p>
<p>Also can you explain what you are trying to accomplish?</p>

              <p>^No I think he wants to know which method makes the client open up in a window, which is the createWindow method which is located in GameWindow which creates the game window frame . But what he might want to achieve is a launcher/loader.</p>
