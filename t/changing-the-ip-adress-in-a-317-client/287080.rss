    <title>Changing the ip adress in a 317 client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-ip-adress-in-a-317-client/287080</link>
    <description>i downloaded this server and client off moparscape the name is ddsspeced v2. i didnt know how to change the ip because it doesnt have the option to connect to a servers ip under the password so i looked in client help at other posts to change the ip most say go to client.java or egui file. i went there and looked for the setserver and cant find it im not sure what that means and im not sure if i might need to change the ip in both files instead of just one. if anyone can help me out it would be great.

here is what it says in my client.java somewhere in there it should say setserver but it doesnt idk what this means.

       public final void init() // settings
    {
        try
        {

  
            anInt957 = 10; //high detial //1?
            anInt958 = 0;
           // method52(false); //false
            aBoolean959 = true;
 		
            signlink.storeid = 32; //not really needed for us
            signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getLocalHost());	   
            method2(503, false, 765); //sets gameframe size
        }
        catch(Exception exception)
        {
            return;
        }
    }</description>

              <p>Yes follow The Mistakes advise. And please use a code next time.</p>
<p>Btw for ddsspecdv2, you have to edit and upload the client that comes with it because it has this fraud guard or somthing so other clients cant get on your server. And you cant chage the client name either…</p>

              <p>I used to have this problem, and I promise you, you have to change it in the EGUI file. Look for something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import java.awt.BorderLayout;
import java.awt.Cursor;
import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import javax.swing.*;

public class EGUI
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
                    client.main(new String[] {
                "127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.1", "127.0.0.1"
            });
        }
    }</code></pre>
<p>Where it says: “127.0.0.1”, change it to your server IP address. I’m not sure about the last two though. I just put it there and it seemed to work. Hope this helped. I also have an excellent compiler too…</p>
<p><code>@echo off
title Client Compiler
javac *.java
pause</code><br>
You can use it to compile a server source too.</p>
