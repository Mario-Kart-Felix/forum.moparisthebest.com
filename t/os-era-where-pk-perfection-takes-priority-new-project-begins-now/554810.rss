[SIZE=5][U][B]OS Era - Where Pk perfection takes priority - New Project begins now!![/B][/U][/SIZE]

[SIZE=3]Members of Rune-Server/Moparscape,

Welcome to a new project me and my partner are taking on. We have decided to programme and produce an original OldSchool Runescape Private server with both PvM and PvP incorperated! Me (Reece) &amp; (Alex) are going to be building a brand new rsps from scratch with great features and content but keeping it as close to OS rs as we can. 

So far what we have done in minimal and is going take a long time to build a great server and a great player-base. We realise this and want to make the best experience possible with our creation. We are currently in process of testing and finding all the bugs and glitches known and fix them. This will be taking our main priority as we see this necessary because we need a smooth running base to provide a great experience! [/SIZE]

[COLOR=&quot;#FF8C00&quot;]
The next stage after this will be ensuring we add great content and systems for our players to enjoy! We will add our Donation System and Voting Scripts when these are ready along with custom Donation features and in-game features to allow a better game. After we have added all of the content and new features we will go into a Pre-Release Beta! We are currently in Testing-Beta to ensure all of the problems are fixed before server release!


Our last step will be release ! This is far from now and much development is needed before players can freely roam the lands of OS Era! The domain and final release client will be give on the forums at the link posted below! But by then we will have a full website and domain , we are using a free forums for feedback and then plan to move to a licensed IPB forums!
