    <title>A door facing North east?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-door-facing-north-east/430340</link>
    <description>Okay so i can make doors open and close when they are facing north, east, south, or west. But i can&#39;t find anywhere how you make a door open and close when its facing, for example North east. Any help would be much appreciated.</description>

<p>I would post answer but I am on my phone so I can’t look at my code. Best bet is to look at how killamess handled doors that are facing diagonnaly (has a tutorial). I have a feeling it was something to do with the number 9… like type 9 or something.</p>
