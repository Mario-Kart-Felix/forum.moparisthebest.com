    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fantasy-kingdom-coming-soon-for-final-fantasy-kingdom/437121</link>
    <description>Hello all, I wanted to see what everyone thought of my project thus far. I started it with very little experience in coding games, and a whole lot of experience coding websites. I was tired of playing games that had a singular town packed full of one shop right after the other, one skill town devoted to every skill there was (And so many of them missing) and nothing really to do otherwise. So in November I got a hold of a delta server, and began. At first I was knowledgeable on very little past what was in the client, clickingmost (some) and autospawning and door opening lol. From then until now, I have discovered quite a bit and learned a lot. I wanted to share what has been accomplished to get some feedback from people who actually work on and or play these servers. Friends feedback is good and all but they always try to be &quot;overly nice&quot; and most my friends have never played these or RS.

For the media (God hoping it works) check out the album I have for it here ( [url=http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2529471109794.2121570.1043945774&amp;type=3]http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2529471109794.2121570.1043945774&amp;type=3[/url] )
If this does not work, let me know. I am going to be placing it in my website shortly, and can then link it to there.

<p>For the media (God hoping it works) check out the album I have for it here ( <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2529471109794.2121570.1043945774&amp;type=3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2529471109794.2121570.1043945774&amp;type=3</a> )<br>
If this does not work, let me know. I am going to be placing it in my website shortly, and can then link it to there.<br>
Thanks for reading through this boring, and hopefully it will interest you! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
