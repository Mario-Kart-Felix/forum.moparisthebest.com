    <title>Second easiest way to portforward? Any input?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/second-easiest-way-to-portforward-any-input/361701</link>
    <description>Hello, i&#39;ve tried portforwarding with utorrent and no-ip, and i got it to work fine, but my connection sucks and it just lags every second. but it did work. i&#39;ll look up guides for what i need, but what do you guys think is the second easiest way to portforward after utorrent/no-ip? i&#39;m up for almost anything, if the person has to download the source/server or not, but for some reason i dont understand webclients too much. i was following i think ric&#39;s guide but i just don&#39;t get it :s i&#39;m not super good at this stuff but im willing to try. thanks.</description>
