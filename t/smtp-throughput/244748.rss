    <title>SMTP throughput</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/smtp-throughput/244748</link>
    <description>Hello. I am attempting to install a webcam monitor program that is supposed to e-mail motion detected events. I am having problems with the SMTP portion of the program and wonder if someone can help. I have setup GMAIL, YAHOO, HOTMAIL accounts attempting to use their SMTP mail services with no luck. I setup each of account&#39;s smtp.####.com address and tried ports 25, 465, and 587 with each. I can get connectivity to HOTMAIL (mail.live.com 587) and Google&#39;s (smtp.gmail.com 587) and run into the &quot;must start the STARTTLS first&quot; request. Port 25 on all accounts apprears to not connect at all and that is the port that is presumably used with no SSL/TSL.?.?  My Webcam program allows for limited SMTP configuration, mail address, name, account name, port number, etc., with no SSL/TLS options.
I appear so close to getting this running and would greatly appreciate anyone&#39;s help, suggestions. or ideas to complete the connection with a mail server. Thanks in advance.

<p>Thanks Zstars.<br>
That just might be what I’m up against. I downloaded a freeware program that uses your webcam and sends an email in response to motion detection. The auto email part of the program is very limited with it’s setup choices and I’ve got it to connect to <a href="http://smtp.gmail.com" rel="nofollow noopener">smtp.gmail.com</a> 587 but the response I get is that STARTTLS must be used first. The webcam program has no options for using SSL or TLS. I’ve read somewhere while googling that port 25 doesn’t use the SSL/TLS function but I don’t think there are any SMTP servers available using port 25.?.?. The webcam program is really cool and needed but I think I’m starting to realize why it’s freeware.<br>
Thank you again for your reply and information.</p>

To use gmail’s smtp servers (and probably the other ones) you need to use SSL, it is not that hard to do really.  I have written a java program to send mail through Gmail’s smtp server with SSL, if I can drag up the code in the next few days I will post it here, but you can probably figure out how to do so by searching on google.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>that’s java, in C or C++ you have to use a fkn library like openssl or gnutls and completely change your code[/quote]</p>
<p>Appreciate the reply’s and I will continue to dig around with Google in search of methods and possibly a program. I’m not a software developer/programmer by any means but I’m at the point where I’m willing to learn, anything not to be defeated by something that seems so simple. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Thanks again and if you do come across that program you mention I would be very thankful if you can post it.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
