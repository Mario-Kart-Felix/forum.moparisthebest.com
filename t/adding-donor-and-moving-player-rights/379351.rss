    <description>Hey i&#39;ve looked all round for tut&#39;s but can&#39;t fine any...

I am trying to make a donor rank/status but need to move server owner to player rights 4, admins to 3 and mods to 2 so my donor rights would be 1.

how would i come across doing this?

thanks.

also i know how to change crowns but how could i add a crown for player rights 4 etc?</description>
