    <title>I am a beginnner java programmer, Im thinking of hosting a rsps. Tips/Opinions?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-a-beginnner-java-programmer-im-thinking-of-hosting-a-rsps-tips-opinions/436140</link>
    <description>I have a little over 1 year on and off programming in java. I can make complex programs and eventually would like to make my own small game. Is a rsps going to be too much for me to handle? or a great way to get hands on in this area. Feedback on this subject is greatly appreciated thanks! :)

edit: Is a rsps written in java entirely?</description>

of course it is. rspss are pure java.</p>

Now, look at tutorials and read the explanations (If there are no explanations than stare at the code and try to understand what it is). Make your own things with your knowledge. Some things you need to know:</p>
<p>Economy is the system of how money in your server goes. Let’s say that your server uses coins for currency, as an example. If I give max cash to a noob, what do you think (s)he will do? It all depends. He or she can drop it, make me go bankrupt. Or he/she can divide it and give it to other noobs. Now what do you think a noob that is really stupid will do when he/she get’s 50M? They might do lot’s of things that can ruin your server’s economy. Here are a few things:</p>
<p>Dupe - The player will duplicate the money making it 100m, 200m 400m 800m 1.6b, and so on.<br>
Drop - Waste the money by losing it.<br>
Quit - Quit the server wasting the money in another way.<br>
Give to other players - One player that can be given to can do any of the above with the money.</p>
<p>While giving maybe 5m to a player or so may seem king and generous, be aware of the side affects and what can really happen. Think - Will they really use it? What if they waste it? What if they dupe it? What if they give to someone I dislike?</p>
<p>Being aware of your server’s economy is really important. A bad economy can include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone get’s bored as there is no challenge to making money</li>
<li>People quit because the server is lame</li>
<li>Everyone ends up with max cash easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few strategies and tips to help your server’s economy stay good and not drift away like many servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent duping. If a person starts with 10m, they can double it and in 5 minutes they are a billionaire.</li>
<li>Don’t give to much starting equipment! A player can find his or her way if the server is clean. Giving a 500m or rare item starter can do really bad things to your server. The player can think “Oh this server sucks, I’ll just dupe this cash and give it to some noob!”</li>
<li>Don’t make NPC rare drop’s rate so high! If players are no lifers and kill it constantly, they will easily get the rares and become rich!</li>
<li>Re-check any system you will make that will affect curreny. For example: PK points or other currencies can damage the larger currency.</li>
<li>Reduce the power of extremely strong weapons. Weapons that hit 40+ are considered power weapons. Players who hold power weapons will easily kill other players and it will get unfair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintaining a good economy is a very good start to a respected RSPS. Remember, your players depend on the server’s quality to stay or leave. One thing that will make them love your server is a good economy.</p>
<p>Also, some more stuff:</p>
<p>No one want’s to play on a laggy, down-most-of-the-time server do they? No and to do this you don’t need a dedicated server, nope. Just a well designed server, and a little bit of a computer. What i mean by that is, not your moms old Windows 98 beater. You going to need a somewhat decent PC. I’ll make a list of the low requirements for a “decent” PC.</p>
<pre><code>Atleast 1.50GB of RAM/Memory
Intel® Pentium® dual-core processor or a AMD Athlon 64 Processor
Some type of firewall. I would say ZoneAlarm.
</code></pre>
<p>Alright now let’s break down that list and explain why each one is important for running a server.</p>
<p>We need a decent amount of RAM because when running a server it’s using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and that will use a lot of your RAM, and the more the computer can process that the faster and smoother it will run the JVM for the server. Therefore RAM is greatly important.</p>
<p>Having a Good processor is the most important thing you can have in hosting a server because if you have a old processor than the JVM will use all the CPU up and make your computer lag, when that happens if you try doing anything on the computer while your hosting a server, you will lag the server horribly. It’s still not wise to do anything on the computer while hosting a server even if you do have a duel-core processor (a fast good processor) because it will still leave a tink of lag for the server to deal with.</p>
<p>Your going to need a firewall when having a open port for the public to access, with that open port hackers can plant virus and what not so easy. So to stay safe use a firewall i would perfer ZoneAlarm.</p>
<p>So, say you have this amazing fast computer right? 4GB of ram, Duel-Core processor, All that good stuff. But with bad internet connection that good computer is now trash when it come’s to hosting a server. I bet you never would have thought about your internet provider having anything to do with hosting a a server, well sorry bud but it’s very important.</p>
<p>Q: How do i know if my internet is is good?<br>
A: Test your internet speed on <a href="http://speedtest.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://speedtest.net/</a></p>
<p>So now that you have tested your internet on the speedtest, it’s time to tell if your results are good or bad. First we’re going to take a look at the upload speed you got. If you got a upload speed around 100, sorry but it not going to do you any good in hosting a server, around 300 your going to have a stable server but it can be better, around 600 you will have a pretty fast server, anything higher than that is perfect. Okay now for download speed, with great upload comes better download, your download speed will never be lower than your upload speed. But when it comes to hosting a server download is not that important, because you’re Hosting the server therefore your uploading it to the internet your not downloading it to the internet, see where i’m getting with this? So upload speed is more important with hosting a server.</p>
<p>Bandwidth<br>
So well, you have a bandwidth on your internet and hosting a server will cause that bandwidth to be used up, and rather quickly. Although i never seen a person complain about their bandwidth be ran up from hosting a runescape private server. So i would not worry too much about this, i’m just telling you it’s possible if you have a fairly large server.</p>
<p>Wireless vs. Direct Connect<br>
Alright you guessed it, direct connect with a ethernet cable is better than using a wireless receiver, because the signal is not always full so in random times the server will lag terribly. Pretty basic stuff, ethernet is better than wireless. If you can, use a ethernet cord. If you cannot get access to using a ethernet cord than i guess you better find a way or try to make your signal for your wireless internet secure and in range. When i say secure i mean put a WEP password on it so other people by you cannot use your internet and run up the bandwidth on your internet. When i say in range i mean, close near your computer with the wireless receiver so that you get a some-what good connection.</p>
<p>Okay, now if we have a good computer and fast internet, there is still another thing that will cause lag and a unreliable server. The server’s framework is a big part of hosting a reliable server. Say for example you have tons of junk being processed in the server’s cycle (process boolean/void) will cause all kinds of lag. Say you have saveGame(); being called i the cycle. Are you joking me!? Go take a look at the saveGame() void and look at how huge it is, and it’s being called every 500ms that’s every half a second. You try to do the same thing every half a second for atleast 10 seconds. It’s impossible. So you know how hard the JVM is working for that simple thing in the cycle. Keep your process clean, there are different ways than the process to do things. Try looking into Grahams event manager tutorial.</p>
<p>Multi-Login<br>
Having a stable server is easy, block multi-login. Your like wow, thanks for telling me but HOW!? Well hold on i was getting to that, Those of you who think putting a little script in the run() void in client.java is the right way. Well sorry to burst your bubble but all that does is make it worse. Why? Because your kicking the null/SYI whatever you want to call it, so once it’s kicked it can login again and you may think, “Well it can usually change it’s name” true, but if it’s already been logged in once it has a character file and if it logs in for a second time it will load that file and cause more lag that it would if it couldn’t login again. Get what i’m saying? So the fix would be to check for multi-login before the socket for that connection is made. This would take place in the run() void in server.java. A good idea is to check for banned IP’s/Names and multi-login in the run void in server.java because it’s before the socket is made and it cause less lag.</p>
<p>Thread-Per-Client<br>
In all winterlove based server’s (that’s 90% of all servers) there is thread-per-client and it’s horrible. Let me explain what it is, thread-per-client is when every time a player connects a new thread on the JVM is made, so what if you have 200 players online at once, than you have 200 threads running. Each thread run’s up ram and CPU not much but when you have a lot of them running it makes a noticeable amount. So we need to remove it. The best thing to do is limit the number of threads to run, or just flat out remove it. Graham has made a great tutorial for removing thread-per-client and it’s great i personally love it.</p>
<p>The economy in a server has to be the most important thing you can possibly think of. If you can train to fast or get items to easy or make money to fast/easy than your economy will soon fall and people will get board of playing your server and quit. So you need a well thought of economy, not too hard like real runescape but not easy, try to make rare items RARE, no object training because you will get massive clicking making lag and that’s noob to have object training NPC training is the best way. When trying to make a good economy you need money and prices on items to buy, try to use real runescape prices but even if you do that, you need a good way for people to earn money but not to fast.</p>
<p>Let’s get into more detail about the training, and earning items. If you were to train fast say get a 99 skill in less than a week, it would be way to easy. Getting a 99 skill and earning a skillcape should be more rewarding and how would it be rewarding if it can be done in only 7 days? See what i mean? Now same goes for getting items, if you can make the money for a party hat in 4 days, that’s extremely easy and the economy is horrible. party hats should take weeks, months to earn. The party hat is only one example this should go for all items.</p>
<p>Commands should only be used for moderation and moderation only. Not for public use! When you have a command that teleports you, the new players might not know about it and people might forget about it, ect. And it makes the server too easy, they have feet they can walk. When you have a command that gives you a item, than you can just quit hosting a server, because your economy will fall don’t matter what that command gives you. Because there should only be these commands in a server (only for staff);</p>
<pre><code>::ipban {victim}
::ban {victim}
::unban {victim}
::mute {victim}
::unmute {victim}
::teleport {xcoord} {ycoord}
::xteletome {victim}
::xteleto {victim}
::yell {message}
</code></pre>
<p>Use the teleport command to teleport to a set x and y coord on the map grid.<br>
Use the xteletome command to teleport a person to you.<br>
Use the xteleto command to teleport to a person.<br>
Use the yell command to yell out a message to all players to announce somthing.<br>
The other commands are self explain.</p>
<p>When i see them servers that say “First one in gets mod” i think of them as a noob server. When picking staff you need to take time on it, and chose wisely. It should take a long time for someone to earn staff, they need to show that they are trustworthy for the job and they are active to moderate the server. Never let someone be a admin unless they are part in development in the website and or server.<br>
Things to look for when you chose a moderator.</p>
<pre><code>Follows all rules
Tells other to follow rules
Uses the report abuse when it's needed
Helps out others when they need help
Good grammar and english
Active player so they can moderate actively
</code></pre>
<p>Them are the things i would look for in picking staff, and i’m sure it’s what jagex would do also.</p>
<p>Every server needs a website for a forum atleast and sometimes a webclient, ect. Not one of them smfforfree sites, because they are just plain out noob. I’m talking about your own domain. The main point of having a website is for forums, so the players of your server can talk about the server rant, post suggestions, show off their character, report bugs, reportplayers, complement, ect. You need to have people discuss about the server. Else you will not know what the people want or whats wrong.</p>
<p>Without advertising your not going to get a big server, so that’s thy you need to advertise your server all over, so than people will know about it and play it. That don’t mean you should go off and spam forums and websites with your URL, because that will get you enemies and people that want to crash your server and or website. So advertise safely! Some ideas for safe advertising.</p>
<pre><code>Post your server in all the serverstatus pages you know
Post your server in all the forums that allow advertising
Post your server on top list sites
Tell your players to tell their friends and their friends and so on
</code></pre>
<p>Them are only the basic things, i’m sure you will think of more things that work.</p>
<p>To release a server online: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd5CO9PowQY" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd5CO9PowQY</a>.</p>

Yeah, I have hosted before.</p>
<p>Tips? Sure.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you set your PATH and CLASSPATH correctly.</li>
<li>If you have a “Could not load main class” error, try running your client as "java classpath . (class name without the .class)</li>
<li>Spaces don’t matter in Java, so make sure you use it so it’s easy to read.</li>
