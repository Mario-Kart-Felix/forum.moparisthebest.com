    <description>I was looking around google and happend to come across this documentary filmed by Alex Jones. I found it quite interesting seeing as how this is the only footage out there that has sufficient proof of what really goes on during these secret &quot;political meetings&quot;. For those of you who have no idea what this is, take a look here: http://www.infowars.com/bg1.html. This video is long but its quite entertaining toward the end. After you watch it, post your views on this situation.

Edit - Forgot the video link! Sorry!
