    <title>Any Bryan Adams fans?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-bryan-adams-fans/415509</link>
    <description>I think he&#39;s definitely the best artist I&#39;ve heard. With songs like &quot;Summer of &#39;69&quot;, &quot;Can&#39;t Stop This Thing We Started&quot;, and &quot;Here I am&quot; just have that rhythm that sounds right. I got his Greatest Hits CD here somewhere on my computer desk, but can&#39;t find it atm :s.

So do you like Bryan Adams? And what other songs/artists would you recommend that are similar to him?</description>
