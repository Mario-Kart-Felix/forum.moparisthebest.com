1.0	Fundamentals

1.1 Line Segmenting
	First of when you are tracing a model you want to keep your line segments very orderly and keep a standard unit. Don&#39;t make short lines and the huge lines, they can vary in size but not by too much. When tracing only trace one side so it can be as uniform as possible with the mirror tool. (Tip) I like keeping points on when tracing so I know where my line segments are.

1.2 Using Quads
	Try using quads when possible and to keep the quad as square looking as possible. You do not want points of extreme too much. Also looks nice.

1.3 Align Vertices
	When creating a nice wireframe this tool comes in handy to make everything in straight lines. You should only use this for straight lines, or if you want a 45º angle then you can combine x and y. Use the rope tool to circle the points you want to align.

2.0 	Drawing

2.1 The Ear
	Since this is for kirikugi I will be modeling the mask that he is making. I will start off with the ear. You have the base around the face right? Well now you will begin to trace inside of that ear, still keeping the same basic length of lines, just reducing how many points at the top. Do this approximately 3 times. More segments = more roundness. 5 is the max you will ever need for any model for runescape. Here&#39;s a picture of what you will have when you are done:

2.2 The Rest
	You will want to continue the lines from the ear down until you reach the mouth. As you get closer to the mouth the spacing between the lines will get smaller.

2.3 Creating the faces
	Like I said use the quad tool to make it as uniform as possible. Stick with the square shape. (Tip) Right click to stop a face, or to create a triangle when using the quad tool. Picture now: [img]http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/8897/facepo.jpg[/img]

3.0 	The Pulling

3.1 The Basics to Pulling 
       The basics to pulling is to circle everything as layers. The first outer layer will be the lowest point. Circle everything else with the rope tool and pull it out to your liking. Then circle the next inner layer and so on. If there needs to be more on this subject just post and I will go in more depth. If there is a point that is in between two layers then make the depth of that between two depths of those two layers.

3.2  Connect the Dots
         Once you think the model looks good select all and mirror it. Then move it into place and connect the dots for that red thing in the middle. Here&#39;s what it should look like now:  [img]http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/7147/facepulled.jpg[/img](I added materials so you could tell what everything was.)

4.0      The Details

4.1 Tracing the Details
         Your going to want to create a new object by opening the object panel and clicking new. This will make your life much easier. Then make it so you can&#39;t see the mask by clicking on the eye icon by obj1. Now trace the red details around the eye. Keep in mind your levels of elevation as we are going to be making this curved also. 

4.2 Pulling the details
        This is probably where most people will get confused if they haven&#39;t already. This is my method of getting the detail to be just above the surface. I take a point and move the z axis until i can see the point above the surface. Then I move onto a new point. and move it until i see it right above the surface. This is the easiest way that I have found to get a decal onto a curved object. Then mirror it and move the x axis so it is on the other side of the model.

Apply materials and your done!

              <p>Here is a tutorial on how to create a nice clean wireframe with the trace tool.</p>

4.1 Tracing the Details<br>
4.2 Pulling the Details</p>
<p>1.0	Fundamentals</p>
<p>1.1 Line Segmenting<br>
First of when you are tracing a model you want to keep your line segments very orderly and keep a standard unit. Don’t make short lines and the huge lines, they can vary in size but not by too much. When tracing only trace one side so it can be as uniform as possible with the mirror tool. (Tip) I like keeping points on when tracing so I know where my line segments are.</p>
<p>1.2 Using Quads<br>
Try using quads when possible and to keep the quad as square looking as possible. You do not want points of extreme too much. Also looks nice.</p>
<p>1.3 Align Vertices<br>
When creating a nice wireframe this tool comes in handy to make everything in straight lines. You should only use this for straight lines, or if you want a 45º angle then you can combine x and y. Use the rope tool to circle the points you want to align.</p>
<p>2.0 	Drawing</p>
<p>2.1 The Ear<br>
Since this is for kirikugi I will be modeling the mask that he is making. I will start off with the ear. You have the base around the face right? Well now you will begin to trace inside of that ear, still keeping the same basic length of lines, just reducing how many points at the top. Do this approximately 3 times. More segments = more roundness. 5 is the max you will ever need for any model for runescape. Here’s a picture of what you will have when you are done:<br>

<p>2.2 The Rest<br>
You will want to continue the lines from the ear down until you reach the mouth. As you get closer to the mouth the spacing between the lines will get smaller.</p>
<p>2.3 Creating the faces<br>
Like I said use the quad tool to make it as uniform as possible. Stick with the square shape. (Tip) Right click to stop a face, or to create a triangle when using the quad tool. Picture now: <img src="http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/8897/facepo.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>3.0 	The Pulling</p>
<p>3.1 The Basics to Pulling<br>
The basics to pulling is to circle everything as layers. The first outer layer will be the lowest point. Circle everything else with the rope tool and pull it out to your liking. Then circle the next inner layer and so on. If there needs to be more on this subject just post and I will go in more depth. If there is a point that is in between two layers then make the depth of that between two depths of those two layers.</p>
<p>3.2  Connect the Dots<br>
Once you think the model looks good select all and mirror it. Then move it into place and connect the dots for that red thing in the middle. Here’s what it should look like now:  <img src="http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/7147/facepulled.jpg" alt width="" height="">(I added materials so you could tell what everything was.)</p>
<p>4.0      The Details</p>
<p>4.1 Tracing the Details<br>
Your going to want to create a new object by opening the object panel and clicking new. This will make your life much easier. Then make it so you can’t see the mask by clicking on the eye icon by obj1. Now trace the red details around the eye. Keep in mind your levels of elevation as we are going to be making this curved also.</p>
<p>4.2 Pulling the details<br>
This is probably where most people will get confused if they haven’t already. This is my method of getting the detail to be just above the surface. I take a point and move the z axis until i can see the point above the surface. Then I move onto a new point. and move it until i see it right above the surface. This is the easiest way that I have found to get a decal onto a curved object. Then mirror it and move the x axis so it is on the other side of the model.</p>
<p>Apply materials and your done!<br>
