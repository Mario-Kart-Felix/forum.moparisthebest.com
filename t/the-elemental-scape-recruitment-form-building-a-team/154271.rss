    <description>Hello,
I&#39;m Element.
I&#39;m trying to make my server with other players help making it the best!
If you are a good coder, THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD BE!

FILL OUT THIS FORM FOR YOU&#39;R POSITION:
What do you want to be?
server admin, server mod, server coder, or server hoster (includes co owner), or server java. worker.
Why do you think this is the best position for you?

Whats you&#39;r name?

Do you like to help others?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
My server is 60%done, but a team would help get to 100%, plus more to come!~</description>
