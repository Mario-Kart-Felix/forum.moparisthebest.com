    <title>I need help with Pvp Command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-pvp-command/256744</link>
    <description>Can someone please help me get started with making a ::on and ::off
This is pretty much everything but the wild level itself. Thats all I need to know is how to make you in lvl 20 wild when you type ::on and make you lvl (-1 or 0 not sure how that works) when you type ::off
if(command.startsWith(&quot;On&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0){
sM(&quot;You have turned pvp on&quot;);
}
if(command.startsWith(&quot;Off&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0){
sM(&quot;You have turned pvp off&quot;);
                    if(Player is fighting. I don&#39;t know what to put here{
                       sM(&quot;You cannot turn pvp off during combat&quot;);
}

Ive never done anything involving Pvp so im not even sure where to start.
Anyhelp?</description>

              <p>o god. Only the message sending doesn’t turn the mode on you must have the variable for the code like public int pvpmode = 0;</p>
<p>So, add the int and like code the int to your combat like</p>
<p><code>if(pvpmode = 0) {
resetAttack();
sM("blahblah");
)</code></p>
<p>And make the int change to 1 when u want to turn it on with that command <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Make sure u code that other with pvp on cant attack you and also make sure to add every your attack code when they got like isinwild or some replace that with pvpmode = 1</p>
