    <description>If Runescape decided to take the &quot;classic&quot; aproach with the old RS2, about the 474 revision (Godswords included but before .G.E.)
Wild is there.
Everything we used to know and love, and they won&#39;t add any graphical [b]or[/b] game update that would be close to the current Runescape.
Only thing is you wouldn&#39;t need an account that was created back then, anyone can join and play.
One problem, it&#39;s a different subscription.
Would you argue back for the $5/month+ sub, or with the $7.50 (what ever they are now), or what if they imposed a higher subscription amount due to them having to put up more servers to host this (even though more players will probably go to this game, and quit RSPS).

              <p>I remember playing on Runescape when I was a kid back in '06 for hours and hours each day. I was friends with pretty much everyone and that was the one place I could feel cool and accepted in. I had my first girlfriend on Runescape when I was in 4th grade, and then I later found out she was in 8th and I bragged about having an older girlfriend (before she broke up with me because of the age difference) to my IRL friends who also played xD I also remember in 6th grade, me and my best friend would write stories about Runescape adventures in Language Arts… Ahh I could go on for hours.<br>
<em>sigh</em> I miss being a kid :&lt;</p>

Sadly this is true, I could get on Runescape back in '06 and lose track of time playing, I didn’t care about anything else. It was so damn fun, best game in my childhood.[/quote]</p>

You would play runescape classic for endless hours… I just don’t think it had enough features i liked right around 06 - 07.</p>

Looks kinda fun, but boring at the same time, i think it was the most fun on runescape around 06 when i started.<br>

<p>What are you talking about? This looks like 1000x more fun then what they have right now. I can play this for endless hours. The current runescape I can’t play for longer than 2 minutes.[/quote]<br>
Sadly this is true, I could get on Runescape back in '06 and lose track of time playing, I didn’t care about anything else. It was so damn fun, best game in my childhood.</p>

I would pay $10 a month if they went back to the classic Rs I loved. Maybe branch it off as (Rs2) and continue this version as RuneScape Relms or RuneScape 3, but you know, same thing they did with classic.</p>

I really don’t know why they couldn’t just call it RuneScape 3 and leave Rs2 as it was on a separate server, like RSC. You would of course need membership to play…</p>

They could, which is why I said it would probably be a separate membership fee.</p>
