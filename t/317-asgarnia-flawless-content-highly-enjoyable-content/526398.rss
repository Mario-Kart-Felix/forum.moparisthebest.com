Welcome to Asgarnia. We are a community with an aim of restoring the land of Glienor; the amazing content in our game is sure to entertain any Nostalgic player who longs to re-live the &#39;golden age&#39;. Our development team focuses on the finest details to provide a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience. Our game will also feature new and unique content that will be found exclusively on Asgarnia.

Asgarnia is a community based server. This means our development team focuses on bringing all of the communities most demanded features to life as soon as possible.
