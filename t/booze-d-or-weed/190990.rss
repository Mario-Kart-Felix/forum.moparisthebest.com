    <title>Booze. :D or weed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/booze-d-or-weed/190990</link>
    <description>For me it will always be the drink. Weed makes my mouth to dry and I wake up remembering what I done the night before.

If you like drink, what do you all drink? My favourite drink is buckfast. Or MD. They are both wines. but 2 bottles are only £10 and they get me fucked so its good :)

If you like weed what do you all smoke? I just like the resin (grass gives me a sore head lol). I also like smoking it through a pipe compared to smoking a joint.</description>

Weed is definately the better choice out of the two.</p>

<li>You don’t have an addiction for it.</li>

<p>You can be addicted to weed.[/quote]<br>
What the fuck? ahahaha… weed is addictive in the sense that gambling is addictive.</p>

<p>I’m actually thinking about stopping my weekly smokage of weed, seeing that I almost in deep shit with my ex’s parents about two weeks ago. They found out I was smoking with her, and they threatened to tell my mom about it, and she’s a cop, so the punishment would have been way harsh.</p>

<p>You can be addicted to weed.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not physically, so no withdrawal symptoms if you stop smoking it.</p>
<p>Also I prefer getting drunk rather than getting high. I try to stay at that fun drunk stage though, none of this drinking until I pass out.</p>

              <p>Do you have any proof to back up these statements?</p>
<p>Weed does not fuck you up in the head, and no link between marijuana and cancer have been found.</p>
<p>I’ll just quote myself in another thread.</p>
<p>[quote=“jme, post:30, topic:187017”]I’ll quote a few bits of info off erowid.</p>
<p>[quote=Slikker, W. et al, “Behavioral, Neurochemical, and Neurohistological Effects of Chronic Marijuana Smoke Exposure in the Nonhuman Primate,” pp 219-74 in L. Murphy and A. Bartke (eds), Marijuana/Cannabinoids Neurobiology and Neurophysiology, Boca Raton: CRC Press (1992).]<br>
In the most recently published study, rhesus monkeys were exposed through face-mask inhalation to the smoke equivalent of four to five joints per day for one year. When sacrificed seven months later, there was no observed alteration of hippocampal architecture, cell size, cell number, or synaptic configuration. The authors conclude:<br>
“while behavioral and neuroendocrinal effects are observed during marijuana smoke exposure in the monkey, residual neuropathological and neurochemical effects of marijuana exposure were not observed seven months after the year-long marijuana smoke regimen.” [/quote]</p>
<p>[quote=Satz, P. et al, “Neuropsychologic, Intellectual, and Personality Correlates of Chronic Marijuana Use in Native Costa Ricans,” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 282: 266-306 (1976); Grant, I. et al, “A Neuropsychological Assessment of the Effects of Moderate Marijuana Use,” Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 156: 278-80 (1973); Knights, R., “Psychological Test Results,” pp 111-20 in V. Rubin and L. Comitas (eds), Ganja in Jamaica, The Hague: Mouton (1975); Page, J.B., “Psychosociocultural Perspectives on Chronic Cannabis Use: The Costa Rican Follow-Up,” Journal of Psychoactive Drugs 20: 57-65 (1988); Carlin, A.S. and Trupin, E.W., “The Effect of Long-Term Chronic Marijuana Use on Neuropsychological Functioning,” International Journal of the Addictions 12:617-24 (1977).]<br>
While there is general agreement that, while under the influence of marijuana, learning is less efficient, there is no evidence that marijuana users - even longterm users - suffer permanent impairment. Indeed, numerous studies comparing chronic marijuana users with non-user controls have found no significant differences in learning, memory recall or other cognitive functions.[/quote]</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Actual studies of human populations of marijuana users have shown no evidence of brain damage.  For example, two studies from 1977, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) showed no evidence of brain damage in heavy users of marijuana.  That same year, the American Medical Association (AMA) officially came out in favor of decriminalizing marijuana. [/quote]</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As for lung cancer, there are numerous articles you can read about it. The washington post has a good article.</p>
<blockquote>The largest study of its kind has unexpectedly concluded that smoking marijuana, even regularly and heavily, does not lead to lung cancer.
<p>The new findings “were against our expectations,” said Donald Tashkin of the University of California at Los Angeles, a pulmonologist who has studied marijuana for 30 years.</p>
<p>“We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use,” he said. “What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect.”</p>
<p>Federal health and drug enforcement officials have widely used Tashkin’s previous work on marijuana to make the case that the drug is dangerous. Tashkin said that while he still believes marijuana is potentially harmful, its cancer-causing effects appear to be of less concern than previously thought.</p>
<p>Earlier work established that marijuana does contain cancer-causing chemicals as potentially harmful as those in tobacco, he said. However, marijuana also contains the chemical THC, which he said may kill aging cells and keep them from becoming cancerous.</p>
<p>Tashkin’s study, funded by the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Drug Abuse, involved 1,200 people in Los Angeles who had lung, neck or head cancer and an additional 1,040 people without cancer matched by age, sex and neighborhood.</p>
<p>They were all asked about their lifetime use of marijuana, tobacco and alcohol. The heaviest marijuana smokers had lighted up more than 22,000 times, while moderately heavy usage was defined as smoking 11,000 to 22,000 marijuana cigarettes. Tashkin found that even the very heavy marijuana smokers showed no increased incidence of the three cancers studied.</p>
<p>“This is the largest case-control study ever done, and everyone had to fill out a very extensive questionnaire about marijuana use,” he said. “Bias can creep into any research, but we controlled for as many confounding factors as we could, and so I believe these results have real meaning.”</p>
<p>Tashkin’s group at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA had hypothesized that marijuana would raise the risk of cancer on the basis of earlier small human studies, lab studies of animals, and the fact that marijuana users inhale more deeply and generally hold smoke in their lungs longer than tobacco smokers – exposing them to the dangerous chemicals for a longer time. In addition, Tashkin said, previous studies found that marijuana tar has 50 percent higher concentrations of chemicals linked to cancer than tobacco cigarette tar.</p>
<p>While no association between marijuana smoking and cancer was found, the study findings, presented to the American Thoracic Society International Conference this week, did find a 20-fold increase in lung cancer among people who smoked two or more packs of cigarettes a day.</p>
<p>The study was limited to people younger than 60 because those older than that were generally not exposed to marijuana in their youth, when it is most often tried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d also like to inform you that booze causes more harm to your body than marijuana does. It does more then just make you wake up “with a migraine.”</p>
