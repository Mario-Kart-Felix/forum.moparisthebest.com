    <description>[center][code=java5]Hello Mopar Community![/code]   :D 


[/center][center][u]I am currently searching for a Developer to assist me in my current project.
My current project consists of specifications: (Whats Done already)

317 - Revision
Cleaned Delta base.
All dupes and bugs have been fixed (thats known of)


Whats currently being done:[/u]

Adding Custom Shops
Building a new interface to implement into the game so that when you click the button it opens up one of the following url&#39;s - Vote/Highscores/Forums... etc?
Attempting to create a delta version of FOG (a.k.a Fist Of Guthix)


[u]Whats Yet to be done:[/u]

I know im interested in creating a entire never before seen minigame, i just dont know what. This is where another dev comes in so we can brainstorm our ideas. And create one.


Now i do have a VPS to host this off of. But i would like to get it built completely or at least 75% before i put it online for others to enjoy.
So yes after enough has been constructed i will be hosting it. Im sorry there is no payment for this. Please reply on this topic to inform me if you are interested in joining. If multiple people are interested in creating the server with me that is great! Please let me know guys. Have a great day.
Thanks.[/center]</description>
