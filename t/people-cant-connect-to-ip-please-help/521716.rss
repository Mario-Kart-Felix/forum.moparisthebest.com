    <title>People cant connect to IP? (Please Help!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-cant-connect-to-ip-please-help/521716</link>
    <description>I just port forwarded on my computer and also went through the NO-Ip process. Now, whenever I run my server, it is able to be connected to but I think as soon as people connect to it, it kicks them. I think this because when I got to my Run.bat it shows this:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Connection from *Their IP appears here*
 Null has logged out.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But it never said anyone has logged in. I think my computer is rejecting their connections but IDK how to fix it! please help!</description>
