    <title>Npc Dialogue Frames</title>

    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;m new to the community, but I&#39;ve been working on a server for a short time now.

I&#39;m sure this will sound rather stupid, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be brought up a whole lot, and searching didn&#39;t do me any good.

I&#39;ve heard that there&#39;s a multi-lined NPC Dialgoue Frame, say, for 4 lines.
I know sendFrame126(&quot;Blah blah&quot;, X) works just fine.

OR, how would you get the server to detect the click of the &quot;Please Continue&quot; ID, and continue on to the next part of the conversation.
My quests are a little silly having to click on the NPC 20 times to get the whole conversation out of him. =(

Either of those questions answers would be appreciated.</description>

<p>Have a look at the bottom of your client.java. Around the bottom someplace will be the default NPC dialogues, to do with the magic npcs and that. Ctrl+f some of those numbers used in there, and after a bit you will find the other things to do with NPC Dialogue. If that doesn’t work, I’m sure there are methods called on in that bottom method. Follow them to find the other NPC Dialogue things.</p>
