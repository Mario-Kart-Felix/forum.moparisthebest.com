    <description>Hi all :) 

I&#39;ve got a week vacation right now, and i know i&#39;m gonna be bored, so maybe people here need a website, which i could make? :) I can do it in html (mainly) and if you need some scripts, i&#39;ll make some php scripts.
The way i normally make layouts for people is like the way they send me a picture (paint?) how they want it, like here&#39;s the menu, there&#39;s the header etc. Just say a bit how you want it, and it&#39;ll be finished in no-time.

By &#39;best&#39; project so far is http://www.emiles-site.tk. Still not finshed, but i don&#39;t update anymore hehe :) 

Pricing will be very cheap, mainly depending on the amount of work i have to do. A default website will be around $15, transfered with paypal :) 

Any people i can make happy with this? :)
