              <p>If I’m thinking what you’re thinking about your no-ip in the browser, then try putting in your default gateway.(Ex: 192.168.1.1) You can find the default gateway by going into your cmd prompt and typing ipconfig Just go until you see the first “Default Gateway”. Then search it in your adress bar.</p>
