    <title>Help with DayZ I am retarded</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-dayz-i-am-retarded/525752</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t figure out how to play it, I even looked at 300000000000000000000000000000000000000000 tutorials.

I really can&#39;t figure it out.

I&#39;ll buy Arma2 whatever it is if I can figure it out, but help would be SO APPRECIATED. 

Please and thanks.</description>

<p>DayZ is just a huge bunch of scripts put on top of arma 2 which is a war game. Basically you can see scripts as rules, and a set of rules makes a game. You have loots spawning at 100 something meters, loots regeneration, poor health design, zombies popping in or out from/to nowhere… How in the hell could you even think this is a simulator?

Arma 2 is not a ‘war game’ it is a tactical military simulator, argue all you want but that is what it was built for. So basically you’re looking for a scripted game? fudge no! No one wants a game like DayZ to have scripted quests, that is completely stupid who would even consider that? Basically what Rocket is doing is giving the player full control over what they want to do. Scripted quests do not give that option because you either complete the quest or you don’t. Think about it in retrospective, left 4 dead, dead rising, they all had scripted quests and believe me I’m not saying thats bad but Rocket saw an opportunity with arma 2 to create a realistic zombie survival and he took it, it was new and anything else otherwise wouldn’t have been big news.</p>
<p>P.S. to your satisfaction, there are a few mods out there that do have optional quests like on DayZ Breaking Point.</p>

Rocket ALWAYS states that when adding content or deciding on content not just with the SA but the mod too that he strives for authenticity and everything must be authentic to be added into it. This means that if you wouldn’t consider doing it in real life then it won’t be incorporated into the game, he’s also stated on several occasions that it is created to simulate a zombie apocalypse, this would make it a simulator. You seem to know pretty much nothing and are just making your mouth go for no reason. The Arma2 game engine is absolutely terrible and this is why the dayz mod for Arma3 is much, much cleaner. Regardless of how this mod was created for arma2, if the engine doesn’t support certain things then the mod simply cannot do it, for example: zombies running indoors, moving through fir trees. Arma2 was never meant to deal with what dayz pushes it to which is why it is so glitchy. Not to mention rocket was a less than amateur programmer when it was created.</p>
<p>If you want a story line, don’t look to dayz. If you say that dayz wasn’t created to simulate what could happen in a zombie apocalypse then you are sorely mistaken. There will never be a story line added to it for that reason, it isn’t authentic. You would never, ever imagine going on a quest when you are threatened by zombies, bandits and the need to just find enough food and drink to survive.[/quote]<br>
Can quests not have helping missions? perhaps finishing a quest yields to weapons and awards. I can imagine questing during a zombie apocalypse, wtf. Saving some person, killing some zombie with alot of health, maybe a military general of somesort with weapons on him, tho since he is a zombie he doesnt use em, but unlike most zombies he is abit faster and has more health, idk what it would be like since the content isnt there. I just said I would like it idk, would be cool<br>
I know nothing? I played it for several hours, (probably not playing it as much as you, (playing restlessly))  you stated it was a simulator, that states a real situation during a zombie apocalypse, which clearly it is not.<br>
You have no idea what you are talking about and yet you are running your mouth off. It is a game like I said. It does not imitate a real life imitation of a zombie apocalypse.<br>
CUZ YEAH  because when the zombie apocalypse happens, all the cars will be wrecked for no reason.<br>
Do you honestly believe it was made to imitate real life apocalypse, you are sadly mistaken.<br>
Right know there is no survival aspect. The game is so easy and filled with weapons that people have sadly nothing else to do but to shoot other people. Please, be honest. Right know in DayZ you go to any town and you got food and water. With that you could survive for ever, without even encounter a player. The zombies are no problem anyway, they are just running people who follow you for a few seconds.<br>
Also<br>
DUDE YOU ARE RIGHT Like<br>
are you all mad this is a simulation why else would I be able to carry a handful of ENGINES and ROTTER ASSEMBLIES plus guns tools toolbox …</p>
<p>Oh did I mention I am the worlds strongest man and have very big bag?<br>
Plus I only get bloodloss? I just smacked around and not bitten?<br>
So stop running your mouth, I just said quests would be nice. quests that can either be done or not done (optional).</p>

              <p>[quote=“chillwitm888, post:12, topic:525752”]Well I didn’t like dayz. All you do is survive. It was occasionally super buggy<br>
They coulda at least provided 1 or 2 quests[/quote]<br>
It’s not about quests. It’s not about anything other than surviving. It’s a zombie apocalypse SIMULATOR, if you were in a zombie apocalypse the first thing you would be thinking certainly wouldn’t be “oh boy, I better get these quests done out there with all the kill-on-sight bandits and dangerous zombies”. If you wanted a story-line why would you play something that tries to emulate what would happen in real life?</p>
<p>[quote=“Stealmojo, post:10, topic:525752”]Spent over $40 to get it working for my bro and I, but quit within first 15 minutes, not what I expected… Maybe I can get a refund.</p>
<p>Request Close.[/quote]<br>
What were you expecting? DayZ standalone will hold no bugs after it’s fully released and out of alpha and beta development and testing stages. DayZ at the minute is a mod for an army simulator so you really have to bare with it. The arma2 engine really wasn’t created to be handling any of this so it’s a miracle that Rocket even got it this far.</p>
<p>Also, try out some other mods. Breaking Point has a bit of a story line to it, Epoch is basically when it starts to get more civilized and communities start reforming after the initial outbreak (trading centers, gold, general worth in items, hero camps), Origins is a very nice mod which supports building and construction and then you have my favourite, DayZero. DayZero is a big improvement on vanilla DayZ and I’d recommend it to anyone who isn’t a massive fan of DayZ. DayZero has enterable buildings, no glitchy zombies, a tonne of extra weapons that are more likely to be dropped by the military when they tried to contain the outbreak (not just the usual AK’s and M16’s) and much more. It just feels more complete. If none of that grabs you I suggest you try out some different maps, Taviana is a massive map which feels more complete, definitely worth a shot.</p>
