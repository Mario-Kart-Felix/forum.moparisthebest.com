    <description>Okay guys. So I&#39;m not sure if this belongs in the models section, or here. But I&#39;ll just try here anyways. So I have this incredibly made boxing arena that one of my friends made me (not sure if they want me to say their name or not) but whenever I add it, it looks glitchy when I move around. I think it is a priority problem but I&#39;m not sure. This is what the problem looks like.

Here is what i have in objectDef.


[code]			if (i == 6200) {
				objectDef.name = &quot;Boxing Ring&quot;;
				objectDef.description = &quot;Fight in hand to hand combat.&quot;.getBytes();
                objectDef.anIntArray773 = new int[1];
                objectDef.anIntArray773[0] = 62000;
				objectDef.hasActions = true;
                //objectDef.actions[1] = &quot;Climb&quot;;
			}[/code]


What do I do to fix this?</description>
