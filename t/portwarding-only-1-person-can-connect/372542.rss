    <title>Portwarding - Only 1 Person Can Connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/portwarding-only-1-person-can-connect/372542</link>
    <description>Hey, i have portfowarded and it says my ports are open but it can&#39;t ping my router.
I ran my source and connected with clicnt. Then, when i logged out, i couldn&#39;t re-connect untill ir estarted server again. this has happened to me with 5 different clients and sources,
I am using a Belkin router - maybe my firewall is blocking something? :S 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Firewall &gt; WAN Ping Blocking 

ADVANCED FEATURE! You can configure the Router not to respond to an ICMP Ping (ping to the WAN port). This offers a heightened level of security. More Info 

Block ICMP Ping &gt;    Enabled&lt;/blockquote&gt;
