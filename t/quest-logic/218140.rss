    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quest-logic/218140</link>
    <description>Hi.

I plan to write all the Runescape Classic quest&#39;s into RSCD source. Quests have not been added, and hardly attempted in the RSC area.

I&#39;m not going to put this in moparscape becuase 99% of people wont know what im talking about, and the ones that do probably will not give valid answers.

This isnt so much about Runescape, just the logic on the best way of doing this. Quest&#39;s obviously have &quot;Waypoints&quot; to know how far you are in the quest etc.



Whats the best way of doing this? The only way i could think of was..

1. Adding a string column to the database of each player.
2. It holds a String something like this  &quot;0-3|1-0|2-0|3-5&quot;  so for example. The first 0 is the quest ID. the - is to splitter character, the 3 would be the waypoint of quest 0 that its up to. the | is the next quest splitter.
3. This could be split into a quest ArrayList and the quest ID&#39;s could be the position in the list, while it holds the waypoint.

Example

ID 0 = Sheep Shearer
ID 1 = Demon Slayer
ID 2 = Dragon Slayer

and the quests are just the position in the array.

Now upon talking to NPC&#39;s that have quest options. It would have things in it such as If (player.arraylist.get(1).equals(1)) { //insert code for part 1 of the quest started here, which would have started the quest. 0 would be non started.

Then when finishing a part of the quest, it would +1 the int stored in the correct quest ID

Then when saving/logging out. it puts them altogether in one of those string&#39;s it loads in and stores it in the db.


Anyway so my question is, is there another alternative that might be more efficient or &quot;proper&quot;. Thanks</description>

<p>xEnt,  if you’re going to incorporate a database into your project, then it would be beneficial for you to learn SQL. You can start by creating a Players table, and have fields for things like the players hitpoints, level, etc. Then you can create a separate table for Quests, and inside that table you can have fields to keep track of quests the individual player record has started.</p>
<p>Fasga’s comment basically summed up the fact that you need to be aware of what a relational database management system is. Say you have your separate Players table, and a Quests table. The primary key for the Players table is “player_id” and it’s an auto increment. You could have Players start quests by taking their “player_id” field from the Players table, and storing it in the quest table, along with fields that provide information on how far the player is along with the quest, etc. You could then perform an INNER JOIN on this data based on matching the “player_id” primary key in the Players table with the “player_id” in the quests table.</p>
<p>Just learn SQL.</p>

<p>And why would you not just have 1 entry per player’s quest ‘status’, each with a foreign key pointing to the related quest?  It would be much easier than concatenating all the data into one entry per player.</p>
