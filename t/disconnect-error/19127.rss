    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disconnect-error/19127</link>
    <description>Okay, just to say in the very beginning, Im not a brainless stupid asshole who has 0 thoughts about this thing.
Yes this is new but i do understand much of this!

So, after installing it properly, and maked a server, port and everything.
I connect to my sever, but after like 10 mins, me and my friends get disconnected, and when we try to reconnect it says: Already logged in, or then server must be down.
I have no idea, but i must remake the server every damn time, and re-get my items!</description>
