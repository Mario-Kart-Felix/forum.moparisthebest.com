    <title>Account Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/account-problem/9378</link>
    <description>Hello,

Just was told about moparscape by a freind and really impressed by it.

I was told to go on sunscapes server and make a account there, which i did and was smithing fairly quickly (just started to make rune) and for some odd reason the server logged me out and keeps saying theres a error in the server and it might be down, but i know its not cause i can create a new account right away. I have entered the ip correctly everytime. Does the server or somebody kick me out? or just does it do that automaticly to protect from bots or somthing? seems like its banned that account.

Any ideas? Thank You For Your Time

              <p>So the server kicked you off of someone elses server and now you can’t get back on?</p>
<p>You really can’t do anything except wait until the hoster restarts the server. Try contacting them.</p>
<p>After looking at the error: “The Server Might Be Down” ; well, it might be down?</p>

              <p>um well i’ve been told that some person hacked that server and deleted it or something like that by a friend on <a href="http://punkscape.zapto.org" rel="nofollow noopener">punkscape.zapto.org</a> so that may be the problem.</p>
