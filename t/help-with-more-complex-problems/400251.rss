    <description>ok so im trying to learn more about rsps&#39;s. i understand some of the coding and want to learn how to code more of my own stuff into servers but dont know how. ive tried to look for tutorials but the ones i&#39;ve found pretty much suck. i need help with the following:

- how to add new items like 600+ into a 317.
-how to change the interface, because i dont like the old 317 one. not the graphics but just the interface.

thats all i can think of. much appreciated if someone could help me and not flame me. thanks again guys</description>

              <p>This has a lot of stuff to do with the cache, not server. You should probably learn about dat packing and client sided java if you want to know more about doing this.</p>
<p>When I say client sided java, I mean learn the stuff that you will need to know to edit the client.</p>
