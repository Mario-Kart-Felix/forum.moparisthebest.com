    <description>ok probably could ask this on my providers forums still probably am, but today i just started having problems receiving txt. i get the text but it looks as if what ever is suppose to decode it did not do its job. idk if its the phone that is suppose to decode the message or if its the service provider b4 you get the text. all i know is when i got the text it comes to me in the form of either the message encrypted in rsa or one of those algorithms. i was going to say its in some kinda base-code format. i can post the message i got if you would like. and its not just my phone i restarted my phone thinking it was my phone but its happening on my moms phone too. we both have the same phone but that shouldnt matter b/c my phone is practically not the same phone b/c i have done so much to it like, flashed a new rom and kernel on it and so forth. i was wondering if there is some way to decipher it and get the message or if you need a key or something. well i guess now im going to look at how text messages are done(sending, encrypting, receiving all that good stuff). thx.</description>
