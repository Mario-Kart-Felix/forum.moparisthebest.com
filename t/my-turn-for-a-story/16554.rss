    <title>My turn for a story</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-turn-for-a-story/16554</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a short preview of a story I started today at school. If people like it then I&#39;ll continue to post more.


He could smell it in the heavy, moist air. The smell was so stomach churning he could taste vomit in the back of his throat. He went to lift his hands to cover his nose but he realised his arms had been tied down. He started to panic, tried to scream, but he couldn&#39;t. There was some sort of object in his mouth, a sort of gag. He couldn&#39;t see anything at first but pitch black. His vision started to adjust and he could see what looked like a pin sized speck of light comming from somewhere to his right. He thought he ws in hell. That&#39;s when he heard it, a faint but audioable bubbling nose followed by a muffled scream. The light vanished to be replaced by total darkness.</description>

</aside>
<p>Lol, the use of “he” and “his” was put there on purpose. I don’t want to give away anything else from later in the  story but it was meant to help you relate to the way he was feeling(<em>cough</em>he can’t remember who he is<em>cough</em>). I realize I kind’ve over used them but I guess it’s too late now. Also soon in the story I stop over using pronouns <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
