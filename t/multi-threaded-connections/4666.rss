    <title>Multi-Threaded Connections</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multi-threaded-connections/4666</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having more issues with this chat client I&#39;m making, the biggest being that multiple clients can&#39;t connect to the same Input and OutputStreams in the server (I&#39;m pretty sure this is the problem). I&#39;ve tried [i]many[/i] tutorials, and none of them have helped my problem. If someone could just tell me the answer or point me in the right direction, thanks. I&#39;m about to die of tiredness, &#39;night. XD</description>

              <p>The only way i can think of, is to create the ‘Main’ class, and then extend off of it like a ‘hack’, or something, and declare a new instance every time you want to load it, and have a class for dataIn and another for dataOut, and queue everything so it doesnt try to spit everything out at once, at least, thats how i did it for my java irc bot.</p>
