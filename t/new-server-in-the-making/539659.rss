    <title>New Server in the making</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-server-in-the-making/539659</link>
    <description>I am just starting on a new project, and need a 1 person team that can change the ip on the client, compile, know how to work a .bat file. easy stuff really. Somene with some time on there hands. This person will get a staff spot on the live server once we get things setup, any other person that helps wil be able to login to the beta server once we get to that point.

[b]Short Term Goals:[/b]
[code]Setup server, see stability of the server, decide on a revision. [/code]

more updates to come as they progress, Will probable be a month or two before things start taking off,</description>

              <p>[quote=“Scape-JAVA, post:2, topic:539659”]I think your short-term goals are in reverse order. You should be deciding on a revision, setting the server up, and then stressing the server to check the stability of it. And quite honestly pal, changing the ip in a client, compiling, knowing how to work a .bat file is common knowledge and shouldn’t require a single person to do that stuff. I think before you try to start a server development you should familiarize yourself with programming and the rs2 protocol a wee bit more.</p>
<p>This is a good place to start familiarizing with the protocol<br>

<p>Good luck.[/quote]</p>
<p>I already know this stuff i just want someone on the other end to know it. This isn’t my first rodeo when it comes to java private servers. doing a .bat is very simple just have to know the file path, but i want someone who knows how to do this so they can test things on their end, i stay in the coding box, this person tests the ingame part</p>
