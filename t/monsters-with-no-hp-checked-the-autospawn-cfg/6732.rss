    <title>Monsters with no hp (checked the autospawn.cfg)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/monsters-with-no-hp-checked-the-autospawn-cfg/6732</link>
    <description>Ok, lots of my monsters i spawn crash the game. I searched the forums and found out this is due to them having no hp, and it said to add hp to them in the autospawn.cfg, well i checked my autospawn and there is nothing there about hitpoints, absolutly zilch. This is my autospawn.cfg, if u can see the problem please tell me what it is, or fix it yourself and send it back to me.

Also, while i&#39;m here, does anyone know how i can change where new players spawn on my server?</description>
