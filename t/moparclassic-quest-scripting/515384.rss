    <description>Is the Scala quest plugin incomplete, because Quest.scala literally only contains

[code]
package org.moparscape.msc.gs.quest

abstract class Quest(val id:Int, val name: String, var stage: Int, val worth: Int, val finished: Int)[/code]

Would it be easier just to revert back to the Java scripting system from the master branch?</description>

<p>I guess I just don’t understand Scala at all, and on top of that I’ve never written a quest for a server at all.

Any suggestions?[/quote]You don’t need to implement any methods like that, you just implement the quest part like you would any other content.</p>
<p>Also, yes, you can extend classes written in one language in the other. You can call methods from one that is written in the other. In essence, the compiler doesn’t know the difference.</p>
