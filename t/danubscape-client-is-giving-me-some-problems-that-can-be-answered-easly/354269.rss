    <description>DanubScape client has been a very great source/server to start on, unfortuneitly, they have made there own little signatures on the client, the login screen instead of saying &quot;Runescape&quot; now has a picture of 4 differenlt logos say DaNubScape, same with the Inventory in the game, it says, Danub &amp; K0 Kingz own server. Now, Can someone please tell me how to change it to my own picture, and get rid of theres?</description>
