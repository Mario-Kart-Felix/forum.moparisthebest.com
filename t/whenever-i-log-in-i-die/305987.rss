    <title>Whenever I log in, I die!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whenever-i-log-in-i-die/305987</link>
    <description>Hello, this is Razor, from Jad-Scapez and I&#39;m playing on my server when all of a sudden it disconnects, so I thought it was just some lag passing through. So anyway, when people were logging on, they would die, losing all but three items. Even if you disconnect, and log back in, you still die, but if you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll only get 10HP taken away, unlike me, when I had a 93 knocked outta me. 

Anyways, I posted this topic because I was wondering if the Mopar Scape staff or maybe some expert players and coders could help me out on this. Thanks for reading.  :(</description>
