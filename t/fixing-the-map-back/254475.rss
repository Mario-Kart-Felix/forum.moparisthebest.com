    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixing-the-map-back/254475</link>
    <description>alright i fixed the flames on my client (for those who were wondering the same thing just find method58 and delete everything but this:

[code]
method58
{
}
[/code]

this was all i had to do but it may be different for you anyways-&gt;) my map back is the wierd brown thing that runescape used to use but it doesn&#39;t match the rest of the theme of my client at all... the client theme is green and black and then there&#39;s one square that is the ugly brown color.. i&#39;ve had clients where it matched before but i can&#39;t figure out how to change it now.. if somone could help me that would be awesome...[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 01, 2009, 11:59:24 pm[/size][hr]oh.. forgot to mention.. the method 58 part is in the client.java of your client</description>

<p>Go into the Icons in your client folder… The same ones as how you change the background, change the color of the Map and then compile your client.[/quote]<br>

if it is just open it with paint</p>
