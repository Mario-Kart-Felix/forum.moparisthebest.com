and here are my formula&#39;s:
[code]	public static boolean pickPocketSuccess(int lvl, int reqLevel)
	{
		double dif = lvl - reqLevel; // Get difference
		double rand = ((r.nextDouble() * 100) + 1) / 100;
		double success = ((3.27 * Math.pow(10, -6)) * Math.pow(dif, 4) + (-5.516 * Math.pow(10, -4)) * Math.pow(dif, 3) + 0.014307 * Math.pow(dif, 2) + 1.65560813 * dif + 18.2095966) / 100.0;

		if(success &lt; 0.35)
			success = 0.35;

		if(reqLevel &lt; 15)
		{
			if(lvl - reqLevel &lt; 10)
			{
				if(Rand(1, 10) == 5)
					success = 1.0;
			}
		}

		if(rand &lt; success)
			return false;

		return true;
	}[/code]

Also, this took me all of 5-10 minutes to code, that took Pan^Cakes &quot;hours&quot; as he has said, to code...</description>

              <p>Lothy even if you have it not hardcoded, take XML for example. The only thing you can modify is loot, exp etc, if you were going to add new npc’s to thieve from, you need to edit the hard code anyway.</p>
<p>But even still, thieving code is not supposed to be modified often, i mean you don’t see people modifying the ores you get from mining do you? in fact i’ve never really seen that modified ever. Once it’s set how you like it, it rarely ever needs changing. XML is more friendly to newbies (especially here) as they would have trouble finding out exactly where to modify the variables in the code. But that might be a good thing.</p>

              <p>Why are you flaming each other over a piece of code?</p>
<p>I don’t particularly like Hixk however I have to say that his code is somewhat better than Pan^Cakes (Sorry <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> &lt;3) but I’ll be using an XML table to store NPCs when I eventually get around to doing it myself, though it won’t be OS.</p>
<p>Anyway, both of these guys released their code publically, we should  either thank them and use it or don’t use it at all. Why does it even matter how long it took you to write a piece of code, I highly doubt either of you did it under half an hour.</p>

              <p>So in other words you ripped the formula and just altered a few values?<br>
Also an XML file is alot more flexible and alot better practice for that kind of work, since you don’t know what NPCs you may add thieving to in the future.<br>
It’s all about structure.</p>
<p>If your adament about using if statements then why don’t you use “else if” since it was built for a fucking reason.<br>
Since your statements never have more than 1 condition, using else will provide efficiency.</p>
<p>Typically when iterating through multiple values you will use a switch, because it’s alot cleaner, and purpose built for that practice. Though it doesn’t provide too much performance advantage on if-else.</p>
<p>I still highly stand by the decision to use XML or some other database style system.<br>
You could write a method to load it in about 5 lines, and a method to parse and check it in about 10 lines, and it will save all the hard coding. The rest would be a more efficient, styled file, allowing for additional NPCs to be added, and for easy modification. It also allows diversity for future use.</p>

Why make an unnecessary XML + parser when you can hardcode it all which isn’t any more difficult…in fact it seems quicker.  The formula is almost identical to demonik’s, not 100% identical though.  So what you’re saying to me is that I should be using a switch?  Explain to me how that would make things better, nay, faster…If you didn’t read the end of my post it took me 5-10 minutes to code this, and it far surpasses’ Pan^Cake’s shitty coding…He repeatedly blocked the same code into multiple cases when he could have just made 3 int’s as I did, and his formula was a 1/2 chance, AND he only coded 2 NPC’s…but I guess 2 NPC’s suffices when he blocked the same code over and over…</p>
