    <title>Full Team Needed[Programmers]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/full-team-needed-programmers/538659</link>
    <description>Let&#39;s be straight-forward shall we? Basically I need a small powerful team of specialists to aide me on a project, I have no programming experience, [B]but I do much business experience. Why make this? Basically you will profit from your own abilities, and me and my team will be investing toward it to build it up and market it in order for you to profit and manage as well.[/B] 


My Job is-to: Collected investors to aide me on this, and to provide a reasonable budget to manage things as, (Website Domain, vBulletin License, Dedicated Hosting, etc.)

[U]The Team, and what is needed...[/U]

A simple requirement of:

- Must be 16+
- Enough devoted time to this project
- Mature
- Loyal

[U]Website Developer:[/U] [b][i]FILLED POSITION, BUT WILL ACCEPT APPLICATIONS[/i][/b]
You&#39;ll be required to build a website for the server, forums, embedding webclient&#39;s, general website maintenance and additions and have a large role in server to website integration so programming knowledge will be necessary, mainly in databases, sql / php and some java. Not a comprehensive knowledge of PHP and Java is required. You will receive a 5-10% share of the servers income.

[U]Server Developers: (1-2 Needed depending on how much you can handle)[/U]

[B][I][U]PLEASE NOTE: You MUST, show proof of your programming abilities before we allow you on the team.[/U][/I][/B]

You must know Java extensively, and have a relatively good understanding of how RSPS works and the protocol behind them as the framework will be built OR a fairly unsupported one picked up and used for the server, AKA not PI. It would be beneficial if you had an understanding of any scripting languages, especially Ruby and/or Python as these languages may come into use later down the line of development. Of course content building and upgrading will be required and general debugging in the hosting stages. Again knowledge in databases and using SQL, JDBC, PHP will be handy in coordinating with the website developer so that full integration can be achieved. The share held in the server will be 5-10% of all income.

[U][B]Client Development:[/B][/U] Shouldn&#39;t need an extra if you are good with server-side, client is almost the same. 

[B][U]Any Plans:[/U][/B]

Well, since I have no knowledge personally on rsps, Although I am open to anything revisions between 317-477, I do not want anything 500 or above since my research indicates that there is no potential finically. 

Any Base: Well since stability will be the key, something along the lines of a Hyperion Base, or such(Please recommend anything better in mind if needed) I would love to see the server as a unique one of a kind type, this is what potential players are seeking after all. 


[B]End Point: We ALL can&#39;t argue that we all want to make some money in the end, for whatever reasons. You can use this as your motive if you wish. You will be profiting off of the players that put money in to the game, we will also take percentages to payback investors, but profit will grow. Which is why we are in need of something close or as to experts really. 

The money is there ready for us to invest in to this, BUT they do want to see potential for them to invest. Once they see potential they well let me launch the website to begin building as proof on our behalf. All income will be toward you all after we begin collecting first which will happen since we have enough to advertise this from the ground up.  [/B]

[B]Please reply with your thoughts of how you can be of help, please note that you must show some type of proof or evidence of your capabilities to prove yourself, this is not a matter for children to handle with little to no experience at all in programming.[/B]

Thank You.

<p>You’re out here for “profit” yet you want to use a language like Java, even though the US government said “remove Java from your system”. How many players do you think you potentially lost?</p>
