    <title>My router. and Connection with Codefasga.com</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-router-and-connection-with-codefasga-com/76788</link>
    <description>Hello,


I have a current question about www.no-ip.com.

whats the problem?

The problem is i signed up for no-ip.com and i get my server running then post is on codefasga.com. After 4 hours or so i shut it down and when i got to start it back up the next day it&#39;s all started but! heres the thing- my server is running and people can get on it but on codefasga.com it says it&#39;s offline and I&quot;m like wdf? lol

does this have anything to do with my router.? Because someone said it does i went to look for my router in my computer but ( nothing found )-also could someone tell me where is located.?

Please dont flame/hate on this thread I&quot;m very new.</description>
