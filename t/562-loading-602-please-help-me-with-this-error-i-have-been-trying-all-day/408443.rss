    <title>[562 loading 602] Please help me with this error I have been trying all day!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-loading-602-please-help-me-with-this-error-i-have-been-trying-all-day/408443</link>
    <description>I will rep you when I get 15 rep myself if you help, Plus I have asked so many times today and no-one has posted on any of my threads they just fall and everyone is ignoring them!  :(

Okay my server is really p***ing me off right now, mainly because the client will not (Will NOT) connect to the server. The ports are forwarded absolutly fine, My other versions work just fine also, I&#39;m not sure if I have set up the Class_a.java file correctly, theres addresses that I don&#39;t really know if they need changing. I also don&#39;t know how to set up the world lists properly however the client detects the worlds I have, so it is somewhat working.

Whenever I try to log into the client it says that it can&#39;t connect to the server, Yet the cache downloads properly and correctly along with the client able to list my worlds. I am really confused why I can&#39;t log in.

[size=14pt]All help is appreciated, Please post any suggestions and ideas thanks![/size]</description>
