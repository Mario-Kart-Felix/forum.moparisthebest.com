<p>pouch and abra was right…<br>
But the 255 in region isnt that bad, since its really crowded itll just stop their anims, the people after 255 in a region… it looks bad once you notice it.</p>
<p>You will get t2 errors, also<br>
in the packet 81, it sends 8bit and its playerSizeList<br>
not localplayerlist</p>

              <p>You are all idiots, pouch’s guess was the closest, however.</p>
<p>During the player updating block, the client receives the amount of players to place within their ‘localPlayerList’, in old engines, however, the size of this list could only be sent as 8-bits. Because of this, you can only send 255 players within the player-to-be-updated’s region at a time. I can only assume the actual runescape server used some crazy prioritization algorithm to properly switch off which players to update, since there are many loaded places where there are over 255 players visible to your player.</p>
<p>So unless you come up with your own algorithm to solve this, find a quick patch for this. Maybe teleport someone outside of the region once they enter a ‘full region’ (with 255 players). Yes, it’s a nasty fix, I’ll start thinking of an algorithm myself for the server I’m writing once I get back to it and finish the higher priority tasks.</p>

<p>Its in the file PlayerHandler and Player, lmctruck maker of riotscape fixed it for crisisX and he said it had 3 problems with player updating block.</p>
<p>In Player.java theres under addnewplayer( method<br>
it says<br>
if 255 in a region stop updating them</p>
<p>why not increase it to like 500, but I cannot test it because I have only like 5 players.</p>
