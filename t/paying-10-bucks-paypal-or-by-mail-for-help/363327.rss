    <description>[size=14pt]Hi guys I have downloaded a very good source/client. The only problem is the client SUCKS as in it has a few customs like dragon claws death cape and things and when I trade the shop its like white claws and a regular cape lol. I know I need to add models and the int&#39;s not to sure how to add the int&#39;s all I need is for someone to help do one model and I think I&#39;ll be able to do it by myself after that. Remember I am paying 10$ for the help over teamviewer or very good detail on how to add. Or you can consider being co-owner and helping me code. Thanks! Add my MSN if you want to be my coder and share the profits of all donations: Dildowillis@hotmail.com[/size]</description>

              <p>you cannot request help for money, read the rules.</p>
<p>you add the ints by going into the class file on your client. but i recommend downloading the 614 clientbecause it is so much better, it has all the models up to the dungoneering master cape.</p>
<p>try starting in class8.java</p>
