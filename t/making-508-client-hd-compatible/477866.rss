    <title>Making 508 client HD compatible</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-508-client-hd-compatible/477866</link>
    <description>Hi...

I recently decided to start a rsps project but this time I&#39;ve upgraded to 508 servers. I would like to have my client, which I found as an IP changing client, to be able to switch between HD/LD. I&#39;ve already found a server source that is compatible. I&#39;ve even searched Google, This site, etc for hd clients but the ones I found were megaupload which is blocked.

I am assuming it wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to enable HD in my client? Where would I need to go in the client source files to enable HD? Thanks.
