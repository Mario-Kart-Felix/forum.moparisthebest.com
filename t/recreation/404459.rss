[b][size=24pt]The Idea[/size][/b]
So recently, I&#39;ve been playing a lot of minecraft, and, if you&#39;ve never played, one of things you may do is change the textures of all of the blocks. Obviously, this would give the game a new feel. So I&#39;ve decided to slightly change all of JaGeX&#39;s weapons (and hopefully armor and other items), just enough so that you get a new feel of the game. So I&#39;ve come here to ask for the help of you guys.
[b][size=24pt]Your Contribution[/size][/b]
If you are interested in making a set (longswords, scimitars, etc.), then just post below what you want to do, and if you would like to recreate the dragon version or not (which would obviously be more complex). Remember, you only need to make one model. Just recolor it seven times and you&#39;ve got a set. I think starting with weapons would be a good idea, just to see if this works out. Try to keep them under 500 triangles (250 quads). I&#39;ve also made a simple example model:
[IMG]http://i56.tinypic.com/9i65ww.png[/img][/center]

Daggers - Reyx7 (doing dragon)
Swords - The Arcanian
Long swords -
Scimitars - 
Maces -
Hatchets - 
Battleaxes -
War Hammers -
Two-handed swords -
Spears - 
Claws - 
Halberds - 
Pickaxes - 

Also, I know nothing about INTS, but if you put these in a server, wouldn&#39;t you just overlap the old model since this would be taking it&#39;s place? I&#39;ll need an INTS guy, so if you can do that, post below.

Getting even 50% of these would be a decent accomplishment. So if you would like to help out with this project, just put in what you&#39;re doing below, and get started!</description>

So recently, I’ve been playing a lot of minecraft, and, if you’ve never played, one of things you may do is change the textures of all of the blocks. Obviously, this would give the game a new feel. So I’ve decided to slightly change all of JaGeX’s weapons (and hopefully armor and other items), just enough so that you get a new feel of the game.

If you are interested in making a set (longswords, scimitars, etc.), then just post below what you want to do, and if you would like to recreate the dragon version or not (which would obviously be more complex). Remember, you only need to make one model. Just recolor it seven times and you’ve got a set. I think starting with weapons would be a good idea, just to see if this works out. Try to keep them under 500 triangles (250 quads). I’ve also made a simple example model:<br>
