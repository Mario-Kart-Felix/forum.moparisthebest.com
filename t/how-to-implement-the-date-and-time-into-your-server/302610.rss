    <title>How to implement the date and time into your server</title>

    <description>Hi guys, this tutorial is pretty basic but the opportunities are endless.

At the top of the class you want to contain the date getting method place:

[code]import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;[/code]

Most of you will just put it in client.java

Then in that same class add:

[code=java]	/**
	 * Gets the date + Time etc
	 */
	 
	public static String now(String dateFormat) {
		Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
		SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(dateFormat);
		return sdf.format(cal.getTime());
	}[/code]

Now lets explain what that does:

It is a String so therefore it returns a word or a piece of text in this case the date/time.

Basically it just gets the Variable you specify that is date related.

Here is an example of its use:

CAM().sendMessage(&quot;The current time is: &quot;+now(&quot;h:mm&quot;));

So that would say the time is hours:minutes according to your computer.

Here are the list of variables you can use

Letter 	Date or Time Component 	Presentation 	Examples
G 	Era designator 	Text 	AD
y 	Year 	Year 	1996; 96
M 	Month in year 	Month 	July; Jul; 07
w 	Week in year 	Number 	27
W 	Week in month 	Number 	2
D 	Day in year 	Number 	189
d 	Day in month 	Number 	10
F 	Day of week in month 	Number 	2
E 	Day in week 	Text 	Tuesday; Tue
a 	Am/pm marker 	Text 	PM
H 	Hour in day (0-23) 	Number 	0
k 	Hour in day (1-24) 	Number 	24
K 	Hour in am/pm (0-11) 	Number 	0
h 	Hour in am/pm (1-12) 	Number 	12
m 	Minute in hour 	Number 	30
s 	Second in minute 	Number 	55
S 	Millisecond 	Number 	978
z 	Time zone 	General time zone 	Pacific Standard Time; PST; GMT-08:00
Z 	Time zone 	RFC 822 time zone 	-0800

So say you wanted the date printed
in the &quot;&quot; of the now()

You would place:

&quot;y (If you want all 4 numerals of the year use yyyy)/ M (Or MM for Jul etc or MMMM for July etc) / d &quot;

See its that easy. Play around with the different variables and you will soon find endless possibilities.

Examples of use:

If you had something in your server that you wanted to go up over hours/days/months e.g interest in the bank you could use this as a much more reliable and efficent way than process.
If you have players from all around the world you can use this to let them know when you are and arent awake.
