    <description>[center][size=36pt][b]Xenorune[/b][/size][/center]

You might&#39;ve seen this project elsewhere, but i&#39;d just thought i&#39;d post it here so that the guys on moparscape also know it&#39;s coming  :o.

[b]Intro.[/b]
Ok, lets cut the bs, it&#39;s time for a serious 500+ project, 500s have been out for 16 months now and there hasn&#39;t been one decent hosted server, and the future looks bleak project-wise. 90% of projects either a) Have no substance to them (just PKing) or b) Don&#39;t have clipped walking (who can take a project like that seriously?), or c) The owner has no interest in hosting. I&#39;m not a big fan of project topics, i think they overhype projects and create exaggerated expectations, but someone has to do something to prove that a good 500+ server can, and will be made.

I started this server back in july but was forced to quit it for the unforseeable future, but in the last month or 2 i have decided to get a move on and develop it upto the point where it rivals good 317 servers.

As mentioned above, i plan to create the first 500+ server which rivals the top ranked 317 servers feature-wise, yeah it sounds a mammoth task, and most servers fail because they set huge goals and a few weeks later realise they can&#39;t reach those goals..so the project dies, but i&#39;ve learned if you take things 1 step at a time and finish what you&#39;re doing 100% before you move onto the next thing, you will eventually get it done, i&#39;ll try not to let this project die since i want to prove that a good 500+ is better than a good 317. But if it should die, i&#39;ll most likely just release the source.

[b]FaQ.[/b]
[I]What version is the server?[/I]
The server is based on the #530 RuneScape client version - there are no significant differences between 525 and 530, for those that are wondering.

[I]What base server are you using?[/I]
I started out with the 525 version of RS2HD i released, which is a very early version of the 508 RS2HD developed by Graham. Every in-game feature is developed by me.

[I]Can i apply for BETA?[/I]
I don&#39;t really believe in BETA for RSPS..but if i do have one, it will be available for everyone, not just a select few.

[I]Can i join your team?[/I]
Nope.

[I]Can you help me with/give me X?[/I]
No!, please stop asking me, i spent quite a bit of time getting things other servers don&#39;t have, so my server can be unique from the rest (since hosting an RSPS is just one big competition). Please don&#39;t even ask for a tip on how to get anything i have because your efforts will be wasted.

[b]Aims.[/b]
This server will be developed to be a &#39;RuneScape&#39; type server (challenging experience rates, hard to gain items etc..pretty much what is known as an &#39;economy&#39; server), i want the player to feel like their time isn&#39;t wasted on this server and that they can log off and it&#39;ll still be online for them to play next week as well as being fun to play.

Here is just a small list of what [I]i would like[/I] to have when i am finished (subject to change lol).

[ul][*]Awesome PvP, PvN and NvN combat.
[*]All skills except Hunter, Summoning and Construction working as good as they can on an RSPS.
[*]Multiple quests, some reap big rewards, others simply pass time.
[*]Achievment diaries, which force you to move around the world.
[*]Pest Control minigame.
[*]Castle wars and Fight pits minigames.
[*]Duel Arena, with item staking (no limits).
[*]Barrows minigame.
[*]Fight cave minigame.
[*]None of the annoying bugs that are in lots of 317 servers.
[*]Clan chat &amp; Quick chat.
[*]Grand Exchange with my own little twist on it.
[*]Boss monsters, such as GodWars, DK, KQ, KBD.
[*]Clue scrolls
[*] - Pretty much anything else i forgot.[/ul]


So yeah, a pretty unrealistic list there many would say, but we shall see won&#39;t we, all i know is if i reach even half my goals then you guys will have atleast a decent RSPS to play, so what harm is there in keeping an eye on this topic and seeing how it comes along?
