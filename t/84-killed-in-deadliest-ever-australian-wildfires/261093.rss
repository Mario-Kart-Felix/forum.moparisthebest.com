    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;HEALESVILLE, Australia – Towering flames razed entire towns in southeastern Australia and burned fleeing residents in their cars as the death toll rose to 84 on Sunday, making it the country&#39;s deadliest fire disaster.

At least 700 homes were destroyed in Saturday&#39;s inferno when searing temperatures and wind blasts produced a firestorm that swept across a swath of the country&#39;s Victoria state, where all the deaths occurred.

&quot;Hell in all its fury has visited the good people of Victoria,&quot; Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told reporters as he toured the fire zone on Sunday. &quot;It&#39;s an appalling tragedy for the nation.&quot;

Thousands of exhausted volunteer firefighters were still battling about 30 uncontrolled fires Sunday night in Victoria, officials said, though conditions had eased considerably. It would be days before they were brought under control, even if temperatures stayed down, they said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>I was listening on the radio and 2 people were fined for starting fires that burnt out almost 500 hectares each.<br>
Victoria’s death toll is up too 110+ as of recent notice, and there are some bush fires about 3 hours away from me in Petes Ridge. (Although I think they’re under control)</p>
