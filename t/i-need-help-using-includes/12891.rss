    <title>I need help using Includes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-using-includes/12891</link>
    <description>Hey, well I get the gist of everything but I just need a little help. Okay so I understand that includes are need to run scar with all scripts. How do i use a include when I want to run a script. I mean do I open the include in a text doc or scar doc. Or do i just leave it. 
Also when I download SRL include how do i put it in the correct place to use it. Where do I save it? Thanks for anyone that can help me out.</description>

              <p>You dont need to use and include when you are running the script.  You just want to make sure you have the include for the script in your Includes folder.  The SRL Include goes into your includes folder.  Example: C:/Documents And Settings/TK/Desktop/Scar 2.03/Includes/SRL</p>
<p>Inside that SRL Folder you sould have the srl.scar and all the folders that came with it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
