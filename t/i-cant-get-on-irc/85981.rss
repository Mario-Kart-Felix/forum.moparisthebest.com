    <title>I can&#39;t get on IRC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-cant-get-on-irc/85981</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, haven&#39;t been on for a tad because I was Riding a tad far away, and won a huge achievement ;) I&#39;m not going to say what though. Anyway, why am I banned from IRC? I haven&#39;t done anything lol, is it because of my IP? dsl.nsw.optus or something? Pookey said it was because me and Wonderguy both share the same dsl.nsw.optus or something..?</description>
