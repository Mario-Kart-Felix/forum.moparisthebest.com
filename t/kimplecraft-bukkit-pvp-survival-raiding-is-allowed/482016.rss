Kimplecraft is a pvp/survival server where everyone is at war with each other, with only spawn being the only non-pvp area. Your main goal is to go out and build your homes and raid other people for supplies if you need them. You need to build your home somewhere that will either escape notice or be difficult to get to.</description>
