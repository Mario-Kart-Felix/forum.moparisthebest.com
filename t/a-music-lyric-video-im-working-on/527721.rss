    <title>A music (lyric) video I&#39;m working on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-music-lyric-video-im-working-on/527721</link>
    <description>So, I believe I&#39;ve posted this before at one point, but I can&#39;t seem to find it.

But, anywhore, I was working on a music video for Scars by Papa Roach.

What it was to include would be the actual music video (I do believe they made one) or an animated one made by me.
And it also has 2 black sections (I&#39;m currently considering making the overall video larger on both X and Y) for the lyrics of the video. They are supposed to by synced with the voice (it&#39;s a pain in the arse) to a degree.
That makes it a challenge to actually add another component to it, such as the music video because I&#39;d need to sync that correctly too.
I have only gotten approx. 25 seconds into the song, with correct (or should I say near correct) synced text. But I&#39;m approx 40 seconds into the actual song (some lyrics are just added so I can sync them correctly).

I had flash auto-generate the webpage, and I just used (this is bad practice!) center tags, and changed the background color.

How does the part I actually have done look? When I&#39;m at this for time on end, watching it over and over, it [i]always][/i] looks like they are not in sync.

I&#39;d like constructive criticism, for what is done at least. Idea&#39;s would be awesome too. Please, if you can, refrain from flame/hate/trolling.</description>

why don’t you finish the video and ask for criticism… what am I supposed to say? That is great, it has text.<br>
It honestly looks bad. It looks boring and something that you would find at newgrounds produced by a second grader (who could probably do better)<br>
Why don’t you finish it and post it in multimedia section? (hopefully it will be good and I will say something positive about it)[/quote]<br>
It takes time to actually get it done, and I’m slacking. What I want judged, is how well it’s synced and to get the opinions and see if you guys like how it’s synced.<br>
The white (where nothing is added) is just there temporarily while I work out what I actually want to throw in there.</p>
