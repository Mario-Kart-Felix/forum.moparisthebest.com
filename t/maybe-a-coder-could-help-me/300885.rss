    <title>Maybe a coder could help me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/maybe-a-coder-could-help-me/300885</link>
    <description>I am starting a new project from a source I have been trying to code some of it, but sometimes I forget backup my files so that when I edit a file, I can&#39;t go back to the original. So, I have some of the main parts set up but need a coder for fill in the rest for me. They will get tons of credit for doing this for me. Thank you! :|</description>
