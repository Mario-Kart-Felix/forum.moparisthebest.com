The police never called me or anything, but my brother saw a segment on ‘E News’ on TV where the kid from this forum apologized (his friends didn’t), I also found a news paper article regarding it I think.  Anyone care to try to look it up again?  I think he lived in Scottsdale, AZ.</p>

<p>Carson actually seems to be the best of his friends, as he wrote an apology letter and appeared on TV to apologize.  Good job to carson and I hope you have learned your lesson.[/quote]</p>

Unfortunately that does happen, but Gigenet is a good company who understands the DMCA and their obligations under it.  Basically the forward the request to me, and if I either fix the issues they complain about, or dispute the issues they complain amount in a reasonable amount of time, Gigenet (the host) is wholly not responsible for any of the content, whether it is illegal, copyrighted, or not.</p>

<p>I’m not sure why people are so convinced that they can’t get the ISP to give an address from an IP.</p>
<p>Cellphones have a system that allows tapping, with multiple taps maintained at once, from a simple interface, because it’s so regular a request that they need the infrastructure in place. The same kind of thing is being implemented (at least in the UK, I assume elsewhere) for internet traffic. With that in mind, it really isn’t far fetched that they could get a warrant to force an address out of an ISP within like, what a few hours?</p>
<p>EDIT: afaict they dont need a warrant, ripa has</p>

<p>That e-mail is better written than their automated responses, which gives me the idea that they know what we talk about here (they actually watch us), but they are kind enough to not try and shut us down. If they even can, legally, though? It seems like Jagex goes along with their game, and they let the private server community evolve in a (possible) sense of curiosity.</p>

<p>Kind enough not to try and shut us down?  Did I forget to mention my host (gigenet) has been getting DMCA takedown notices about every week for the last few months about <a href="http://moparisthebest.com">moparisthebest.com</a>?  I always reply to them promptly, and they ignore my email and send another identical one to gigenet.  Even the staff at gigenet told them to email me directly at <a href="mailto:admin@moparisthebest.com">admin@moparisthebest.com</a>, and they ignore that too.  Bastards.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/suicide">@suicide</a>, I think they have a duty to report it too, like someone here already said, if they report 1000 fake suicides a year and 1 that turns out to be a real threat where a life is saved, it would be worth it.</p>
