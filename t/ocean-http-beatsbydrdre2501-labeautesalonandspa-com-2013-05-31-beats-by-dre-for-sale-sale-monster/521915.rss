A year after one of several worst droughts in Colorado history, the job areas of Stamford, Texas are usually full of potential, accounts CBS News Correspondent Maureen Maher.&quot;We&#39;re expecting good makes this year,&quot; said farmer Rex Ford. But rather than making up for previous year&#39;s losses, this year&#39;s bumper cotton plant isn&#39;t selling with a profitable price. Growers already in debt from the drought are in difficulty yet again. &quot;The price is the bad part of it,&quot; clarifies Ford. &quot;We&#39;re probably considering hopefully 50 dollars per pound, that is really not even a crack even on natural cotton.&quot; Last seasons drought cost Arizona farmers $1.5 billion dollars, and the state&#39;s economic system took a $4.5-billion hit. That&#39;s because when the crops in the heart of cotton region don&#39;t sell, the entire town feels it. &quot;We develop one house each and every two years,&quot; affirms realtor Ed Ekdahl.Ed Ekdahl is Stamford-born and raised. Over time he&#39;s seen citizens come, but with the particular growing economic battle for farmers, he has been mostly seen them go.&quot;This was a productive little town when I grew up here,In . says Ekdahl. &quot;We had I assume five or six automobile dealers around town. Now and we don&#39;t even have a used car place in this town.&quot; The ripple effect can be seen everywhere. Empty brick and motar are filled only with memories. Griffin High&#39;s flower shop is often a 76-year-old family business. He is struggling to make it to a lifetime mark.&quot;There are a lot of people who grew up about here and we try and do a lot to advertise the town and see who&#39;s survives,&quot; said High. But even if they survive your scars from final year&#39;s dust pan drought, this season&#39;s plentiful harvest won&#39;t be enough -- and there will likely be more heartache from the heartland.
