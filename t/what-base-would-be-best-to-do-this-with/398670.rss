    <title>What base would be best to do this with?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-base-would-be-best-to-do-this-with/398670</link>
    <description>So i want to create a server, with economy, quest&#39;s and alot of Runescape feature&#39;s... 
Nothing to extreme. I don&#39;t really like delta niether do i like Project Insanity (as this is unstable &amp; the community would take dislike to the DC every 5 minute&#39;s.).
I&#39;ve herd Hyperion is good. Although i dont know to much about the base it&#39;s self. Also RS2HD for 562. But i would like to have a perfect door system. This is kinda&#39; hard to add to a 562 so i think that option has gone out the window. 
I&#39;m willing to spend at least 6+ hours a day coding this server.. 
So if you was going to do something like this what base would you use?
*Please reply i wan&#39;t to get started as fast as possible*
Thanks alot,
