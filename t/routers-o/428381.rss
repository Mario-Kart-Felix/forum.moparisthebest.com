    <title>Routers! :o</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/routers-o/428381</link>
    <description>Hey, moparscape! For quite a while I&#39;ve been trying to set up a private server, but I&#39;ve failed miserably on numerous attempts. I&#39;ve gotten help through remote access and whatnot, but the advice was &quot;just join my server,&quot; or &quot;get a new router.&quot; Even got past the port forwarding step, but it refuses to work.

My question is, is the router and its configurations and brand so important that it affects the setup of a private server? I know it&#39;s a stupid question.. but I&#39;ve been trying to set it up on a laptop, which means its a wireless router, and it&#39;s just never working. But my desktop PC has a WIRED router, so my other question is, if that&#39;s worth a try to use, would I still be able to administrate my server and stuff using wireless AFTER its been set up through wired at least?

tl;dr what would be the best router to get for private servers/easiest to set up for private servers? 

Not worrying about price, but something at least affordable xD (or whomever here has a server, what is your wireless router and is it decent)? I&#39;m sick of this slow crap. :) .. I have a Linksys WRV200 if any of you by chance have this.

PLEASE read my post fully and try to answer the questions, I really need teh help D:

Thanks.. from a noobmama.</description>

<p>the source folder run.bat as in did you turn the server on while you was on <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> and put 43594 and did check, and you should be able to portforward on wired</p>
