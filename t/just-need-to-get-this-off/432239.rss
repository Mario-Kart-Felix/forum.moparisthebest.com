    <title>Just need to get this off</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-need-to-get-this-off/432239</link>
    <description>Okay so a lot of people have been msning me asking why I &quot;quit&quot; rsps. I  know this probably is against the rules or whatever but I feel I do deserve I need to tell   the truth of why I &quot;left&quot; rsps. 

As you know Myth-Scape closed down in early January. The main reason of this was Jack(meeper) was infecting his players with  RAT. The ONLY reason why he knew how was because of me. I honestly didn&#39;t think he would be that selfish and self centered.  He had asked me like a month before that how you go about doing it. I  never gave him the full details but I gave him the main jist of what was needed. 

I don&#39;t know why I am telling everybody this but it  just has been clawing at my insides for the past week and I felt you guys should know. If this deserves me getting banned...so be it but I just had to let it out lol. 

-Love &lt;3

p.s. this is  no where near a &quot;good bye&quot; statement I will still be here if you guys still accept me but I  just felt I should let you guys know considering I have had a good 10-15 people ask me.  I also apologize  for lying stating I was just &quot;bored&quot;</description>

I  worked with the guy for over six months. I wouldn’t help explain what to do for something like that  unless I majorly trusted the person. Myth-Scape was a very profitable project for the both of us but I just feel like I did something bad.</p>
