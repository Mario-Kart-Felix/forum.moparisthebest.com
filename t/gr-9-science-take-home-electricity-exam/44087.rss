    <title>GR 9 Science Take home Electricity Exam</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gr-9-science-take-home-electricity-exam/44087</link>
    <description>Alright, I don&#39;t usually ask for Homework help, because I can&#39;t be helped. :rolleyes: Some of the questions I&#39;m not 100% sure on though, and it&#39;s an exam so I want to do well. I would appreciate if anyone could answer any of these questions, and posts sources where possible.

[b]7.[/b]&lt;blockquote&gt;While walking after a storm, Kim notices a power line that has snapped and is hanging with one end dangling toward the road. She also notices the power line is touching a long metal road barrier. (The barrier prevents cars from sliding off the road and down an embankment.

Kim Walks to the edge of the road and sits on the metal road barrier. The most likely result is:
A: There is no affect.
B: A brief electrical discharge occurs between the metal barrier and the ground, bypassing Kim.
C: Kim is statically shocked by the metal barrier.
[b]D: A short circuit is cretaed and the current flows through Kim, injuring her.[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thats the only question so far, its on static electricity. I will be updating with questions I&#39;m not for sure of later. Thank you. :)

Alright, I got the first question, anyone want to help with this one:

[b]39.[/b] &lt;blockquote&gt;The blow dryer transforms electrical energy into what other forms of energy:
A: Chemical and Mechanical
[b]B: Checmical and Thermal
C: Thermal and Mechanical[/b]
D: Mechanical and Electrical&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This one is a bit simpler, I&#39;m thinking B, or C.

Another question.

[b]52.[/b]&lt;blockquote&gt;Which of the following would be most likely to approach 100% efficiency?
[b]A: Alkaine Dry Cell
B: A halogen lamp[/b]
C: Gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle
D: An electric heater&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I&#39;m about 80% sure it isn&#39;t C, nor D.</description>

I actually think that one is a. Firstly, the only types of energy I have heard of are kinetic (mechanical here - Kinetic energy gives the object the potential to move, which is what happens in a blow dryer), and chemical potential, based on the fact I've never heard of electric potential energy... Electricity *is* the energy here - It's not where the energy is derived from. 
An example of explaining electricity simply - A battery produces what you could call electricity.. yet the energy is chemical potential energy. Chemicals produce the energy in a battery. I hope that explains it. Of course, my second choice to that question would be c if I went with one of your two... It's actually a hardish question considering I've been on holidays for the past month and a half and doing everything *but* thinking of school related stuff. :P
<p>As for the last question, I’d go with the alkaline dry cell - It’s chemical potential energy and doesn’t polute. Also keep in mind alkaline is nothing more then water with a high pH level, thus it is probably an infinite resource to an extent. From my understanding, a halogen lamp is a gas lamp, which pollutes the air, significantly less then gas though. As for the electric heater, well in Australia coal is used for power, so that would be causing pollution too.<br>
<em>Keep in mind that those answers are based on how efficient the power is both pollution wise AND based on how easy it is to replace</em></p>

Thanks, I had already established D with the people on IRC. If I have any more questions I will ask, thanks again.</p>
<p>Alright, added a new question. Only 15 left on the test. Yet another question added.</p>
