    <description>Hello everyone, i just wanted to introduce this topic, with a few things. First of all, yes this is a 2006 remake. And no, im not going to quit after a week of developing, and then decide to suspend the project months on months, then take all of the donations, run and threaten my dev&#39;s. I&#39;ve been trying to do this forever, and i&#39;ve decided that it&#39;s been enough. There&#39;s too many people who arent honestly devoted, and come into this thinking that they can make a RSPS and just fail. Now, you can think what you want to think, but that&#39;s not me. I&#39;m making an attempt here to get a team togeather and bring back what everybody wants. Don&#39;t even bother flaming this thread, because what any of you say will not really change my decision to start a RSPS. Yes, i am not a 10 / 10 Java coder, that&#39;s why im looking for a team.
