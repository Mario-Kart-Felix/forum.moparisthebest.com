I’ve had a lot worse, but I shall not name them as I am starting to make it look like I’m boasting about injuries, which I am not. So I’ll leave it there. Oh, and heard your spine crack? I think if you ask Pookey71 he’ll tell you about my injury with my back. If he remembers that is.</p>

If you’re implying that American football is homosexual, then you’re ignorant. A player has to be comfortable with their own manhood to pat another man on the ass. And don’t exaggerate the amount of padding needed to keep yourself from being murdered on the field. Without that padding, easily 2 people could die a game. And no one said they use steroids, if they did, they would be removed from the NFL, NCAA, or High School Football. Other than the steroids taken to heal injuries. Why don’t you get off your ass one day and go outside and see what American Football is really like, rather than forming an opinion based on what your friend might tell you.<br>
