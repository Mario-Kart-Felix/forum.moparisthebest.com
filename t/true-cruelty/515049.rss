    <title>True Cruelty</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/true-cruelty/515049</link>
    <description>Kind of a copy of m1lks thread.

I was thinking. Let&#39;s say, there is a kid who is VERY mad, and he goes into his room and finds his fish in a fish bowl. This guys is sooo angry, he just spills all the water out, and watched the fish slowly die. That&#39;s cruel. What IS true cruelty? The most cruel act.

Also, in Call of Duty: Black ops 2, in campaign mode, there is a scene where a person named Menendaz ties a soldier up in a chair, shoot him in one leg with a shotgun, reloads, shoots the other leg, and watches for 30 seconds as the soldier was crying from pain. The soldier had still not died. So Menendaz got a knife out and slowly slashed the side of his neck and watched the soldiers blood gush out for 10 seconds. The soldier was still a little alive, so he got his knife out and did a fast slash with the knife in the front of the neck. Then the soldier died.

So yeah, what is YOUR definition of TRUE cruelty.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Here is another one, from a movie I just watched right now.</p>
<p>Think about a mother. She loves her children soo much. She cared for them when they were little for everything (the husband died early). Now think about this. This same mother is not in her 70s, helpless about what others do to her. She smells bad, and the children she had have ‘turns’ in having her only for 1 week. They loved their children even more than the mother. She smells so bad, the child the mother is at starts to think, “My child’s party is tomorrow. I don’t want my nasty mother going around acting dumb. What to do?” And also, a side note, this mother talks like she is mentally disabled, but still has sense in her.</p>
<p>While this child is thinking what to do, she decides to put the mother at night in her husbands store closed, locked, with no cover or anything whatsoever to give her comfort. The husband gave an A-Okay and she did it. The mother, while in the store, kept shouting, “Give some water, please!” The child just ignored her and went away. The mother was sleeping on the floor the whole night, cold, baren floor.</p>
<p>The mother has very valuable golden jewelry on her. So, because of that, one child who does not have the mother started to think, “If my mother dies, I won’t get her jewelry, unless I get her back and she dies here! Yes! I will get her back and put her in the garage all day.” The child went to get the mother and finds the mother on the mother, cold, but still alive. She smells very bad now. By now, this child calls the hospital. No, you may be thinking this child called the hospital just because she loves her mother, but she really only called the hospital so she wouldn’t have to take the mother in her own car with the smell the mother has. So, she called the hospital, and THE HOSPITAL had given her a bath. She smelled typical now. The child then took the mother to her eldest child’s house and right at the front door, the eldest child said, “I am not taking her. It is not my turn.”</p>
<p>So then the child who had taken her to the eldest child took the mother to the second-eldest child’s house (There are 5 children by the way). She just left the mother on the staircase and ran back to the car.</p>
<p>The mother on over 70 years of age could barely walk. One step alone and all her energy would be gone. But for the sake of love this mother still had for her children, she went upstairs alone, each step taking all her energy, and when she reached the top, ringed the doorbell, the second-eldest child came. The mother then said, “Please my child, please, give me some water! Please, take me inside! Please!” This child said in a sweet voice, “Okay mother, let me give you some water, and come inside.” But, this child pushed her mother back and the mother fell stair-by-stair. The child did not care. This child just took the jewelry from the mother and left the mother’s body there. The mother in near till death now.</p>
<p>The next scene, the ambulance is right outside the door, and the child pretends by crying, “My mother! My mother, please!”</p>
<p>Next scene, the mother is laying in the hospital bed. The children are discussing about who took the jewelry, they give a heck about what happened to the mother. Later, the doctor came in and said, “Please, stop this conversation, the mother is feeling hurt from this conversation.” The eldest child said, “How can she know what we are discussing. She is unconscious…” The doctor replied, “She is conscious. She is in a very bad position right now. We suggest you pay for a needed operation for your mother.” After this, the doctor left, and the children started arguing about who will pay, and in time, they all made excuses by saying things like, “I need to go, I have work.” Later, they all had gone, abandoning there mother. The eldest son of hers was the last to go, and looked back before he went.</p>
<p>Later, the doctors find out they never payed for the operation. The hospital payed for the operation from a foundation they were affiliated with. This mother was sent to the fosters home, and had lay there, crying her mind out, looking at the last thing she had in her life, a picture of when the children were little and when they loved her. This, indeed, is true cruelity.</p>

              <p>True cruelty? I don’t understand what you mean by that, one satanic story isn’t more sadistic or cruel over the next, it’s all cruel according to the law. Without law I’m sure this thing called cruelty would be named survival of the fittest and entertainment, but we have developed something called law and integrity plus every other synonym for that, care, well-being, love, belonging etc.</p>

              <p>Kind of a copy of m1lks thread.</p>
<p>I was thinking. Let’s say, there is a kid who is VERY mad, and he goes into his room and finds his fish in a fish bowl. This guys is sooo angry, he just spills all the water out, and watched the fish slowly die. That’s cruel. What IS true cruelty? The most cruel act.</p>
<p>Also, in Call of Duty: Black ops 2, in campaign mode, there is a scene where a person named Menendaz ties a soldier up in a chair, shoot him in one leg with a shotgun, reloads, shoots the other leg, and watches for 30 seconds as the soldier was crying from pain. The soldier had still not died. So Menendaz got a knife out and slowly slashed the side of his neck and watched the soldiers blood gush out for 10 seconds. The soldier was still a little alive, so he got his knife out and did a fast slash with the knife in the front of the neck. Then the soldier died.</p>
<p>So yeah, what is YOUR definition of TRUE cruelty.</p>
