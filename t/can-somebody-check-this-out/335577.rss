    <description>Ok well i have a problem trying to open a client that i downloaded off the moparscape sever status page.

I have downloaded Java 6 and also Winrar, And whenever I have finished downloading the client and I have it saved to my desktop, Whenever I try to open the client it would open then immedatly close out and it would say something along the lines of &quot; The system cannot find the path specified &quot;
 
Can anyone help me please? 

Thanks</description>
