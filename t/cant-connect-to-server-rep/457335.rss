    <title>Can&#39;t connect to server.... (REP++)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-server-rep/457335</link>
    <description>Okay, so here&#39;s the problem, guys.

Cannot connect to my server, and neither can anyone else..
If you can&#39;t be bothered to read this, LEAVE. 
Anticipating a bunch of wannabe helpfuls trying to say that I didn&#39;t do these things:


[ul][li]Port forwarded through, uTorrent, Firewall, and though Simple Port Forwarding Pro; router page does show open port 43594 [/li]
[li]Clients are set for NO-IP for the players, for me, I&#39;m set to 127.0.0.1; additionally, NO-IP DUC is online[/li]
[li]Canyouseeme.org show me as open, as seen by the below picture..[/li]
[li]Nothing shows when the players try connecting, in the server CMD.[/li]
[li]I do have multiple firewalls up after a PDDoS that crippled my Hard Drive, but I added exceptions through [b]ALL[/b] of them; additionally, I&#39;ve tried turning them off temporarily, so I would say that&#39;s the problem[/li]
[li]Finally, I&#39;ve tried changing my client sided IP multiple times, including my no-ip, and 127.0.0.1[/li][/ul]


My HDD crashed a week ago, running Windows XP, so I upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate.
The server was running fine on XP, so I assume something changed in Windows 7, as none of the files were modified by the switch...

Ok so this may be the problem! sometimes you may get a virus on your comoputer and when it is turning back on like restoring etc not wiping it. changes ur ipv4 this happended to me</p>
<p>rep highly apreciated</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Even if NO-IP DUC keeps my IP constantly updated? I think not… Besides, I’m pretty sure that I’d at least be able to connect on my own computer if that was the problem…<br>
I ought to remove REP for that^</p>
<p>Thanks for trying, I suppose…[/quote]<br>
This isn’t server sided…</p>

<p>ok well reading everything you said seems like you did everything correctly but sometimes there is an ip needed to be changed in gui.java or some other files, so try searching for 127.0.0.1 in your client to see if there is another file needed to be changed.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why would another IP need to be changed, when the way it was set up before worked perfectly fine?</p>
<p>Also, this isn’t a client sided issue…</p>
