<p>If you source is delta, then it looks like this:</p>
<p>if(command.startsWith(“pkingisle”)  &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt; 1)) {<br>
toX = 2525;<br>
toY = 4779;<br>
sM(“Welcome to the pkingisle!”);<br>
}</p>
<p>This is evil bobs island, it’s kind of crowded so delete some of the objects.</p>
<p>P.S. You can’t rep, i mostly came here to prove you wrong because i think i’ve seen you post here before. Until i saw how easy one of your questions are.</p>
