    <title>Vantage Point</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vantage-point/204235</link>
    <description>Anyone seen it? I saw it a few weeks ago just less then a week after it came out. It&#39;s mainly about a secret service agent who gets shot, and is then ordered back to work with the secret service after a year. It is based in Spain (I think, if I remember correctly :P) and the movie shows about 5-6 different prospectives of important people in the movie. Basically what happens is they are on a stage inside what you could call a park, with hundreds of people around them. Then, the returning agent sees curtains moving (it&#39;s basically an apartment type thing with a big rectangular space in the middle where they are) and tells dispatch. Then, when the United States president goes to the microphone to speak, he is shot twice by a sniper. It&#39;s a really good movie, with A LOT of action, and I won&#39;t reveal anymore. :)</description>
