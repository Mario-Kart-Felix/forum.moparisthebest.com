    <title>Question about editing ladders!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-editing-ladders/447126</link>
    <description>NOTE: I have an Delta base. Only give me answers with Delta.

I have a ladder (object ID= 1748). I have the option of &quot;climb&quot;, &quot;climb-up&quot;, and &quot;climb-down&quot;. If you were to code the ladder to use the case 1748, you&#39;d be coding the &quot;climb&quot; option. But what do you do to code the cases for &quot;climb-up&quot; and &quot;climb-down&quot;?

This concept is similar to farming too. How would I code the &quot;inspect&quot; and &quot;guide&quot; rather than just &quot;harvest&quot;?

Is there a way to have a selective option of &quot;Up&quot; or &quot;Down&quot; when coding case 1748 for the ladder? This isn&#39;t mandatory for me if I can code the other options of &quot;climb-up&quot; and &quot;climb-down&quot;. Please help anyone!
This is what im working with right now
                             (under case 132:)
				} else if (objectID == 1748) {
					stairs = 1;
					skillX = objectX;
					skillY = objectY;
					stairDistance = 1;

I dont know how to look up cases for the &quot;climb up&quot;, or &quot;climb down&quot;

<p>I have a ladder (object ID= 1748). I have the option of “climb”, “climb-up”, and “climb-down”. If you were to code the ladder to use the case 1748, you’d be coding the “climb” option. But what do you do to code the cases for “climb-up” and “climb-down”?</p>
