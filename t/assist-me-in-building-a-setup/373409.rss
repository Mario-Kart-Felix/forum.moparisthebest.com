    <title>Assist me in building a setup?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/assist-me-in-building-a-setup/373409</link>
    <description>Hello [s]ladies and[/s] gentlemen, as you can tell from the title I need help with building a new PC. First of all, I know spoon feeding is bad, but to be honest I really don&#39;t want to do a DIY and find out I&#39;ve botched it somewhere along the line. I know nothing about hardware other than what RAM and CPU are for, thats about it... and I know a lot of you guys are guru&#39;s at this stuff.

My budget is around $800, but I&#39;m not even sure that will fit for a fairly decent PC (I want to be able to game on it etc, but my main focus will be rendering video&#39;s which I can already tell takes 99x RAM and abit o&#39; CPU)

So ya, halp?

Thanks guys! (Also, I&#39;ll edit this thread if I need to answer certain things to make my question more specific, I imagine it would look kindof too general atm).

I live in the UK, so preferably a UK/European (online) store.</description>

<p>That’s the good thing about good integrated cards, you can afford higher priced other components (like more RAM, or a better CPU) and game until you have enough money to buy a really good video card as well.</p>

<p>That means that the motherboard has an onboard graphics card, and you don’t need a separate one.  ‘max 512mb shared memory’ means that the onboard card can use up to 512mb of your system memory, so if you have 3gb of RAM, your computer could use 2.5gb of ram, and the video card could use 512mb.  Of course if you have another graphics card you can disable the onboard one and use all your RAM again.</p>

<p>Depends on what kind of card it is, there are integrated cards that are in the decent to good range.  None of them are going to be top of the line cards, but some could be good enough for a gamer.</p>

<p>If it’s an HD TV, then sure, it will make a fine monitor hooked up with an HDMI or a DVI cable.  If you can’t hook it up that way, you might as well forget about it.</p>

<p>You can lower the cost a bit more without losing quality by the way. Get a Cooler Master Centurion 534 case. It is the one i use, and i’m very satisfied with it. It would work well for you as well, since it aims at minimizing the amount of screws you need, and instead has nifty clip-solutions everywhere.</p>

If you can afford the 6GB, get the 6GB, but what I suggested was halve the ram in the original build i posted (because it comes in (2x 2GB) x2)</p>
