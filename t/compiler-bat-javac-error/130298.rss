    <title>Compiler.bat &#39;Javac&#39; Error?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compiler-bat-javac-error/130298</link>
    <description>Well when I click on compiler.bat after I&#39;ve followed all the other steps to make my own server the compiler.bat&#39;s window comes up with something that looks like this:
[img]http://img73.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ss01sv4.png[/img]
http://img73.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ss01sv4.png
Is that an error?  Once I press any key like it says then it just closes.  I search the term Javac on Google and it came up with many different sites all stating that its the java compiler language.  One of the links said something about JDK (which I already downloaded and installed a little while before I&#39;m pretty sure because a confirmation window came up saying JDK 6.0 has been successfully installed or something like that).  I clicked on the website and it said that Javac is included in the JDK download, so I should have had it installed when I downloaded JDK... can anyone help me?  Am I missing something?  Also when I click on this other compile thing for another source and it says something like:
c - compile server
r - run server
e - exit out of program
etc.
etc.
and I click c or r it says You do not have JDK 5.0 or  JDK 6.0 or any JDK 5.0 and 6.0 updates.  
And I&#39;m just about positive I already downloaded it.  I went to the website (Java website or Sun, whatever it&#39;s called) installed it for windows 32-bit, saved it to my desktop, waited for it to download, then clicked on the icon to install, agreed to the TOS, clicked next till it got to the end and saw the loading/installing bar and it said copying files or something for a couple of minutes and then started to install a bunch of stuff.  Once it was done it said it was installed and I clicked finish along with the check of []View Read Me and the read me popped up and I read a little and close it down...

Can someone please help me.</description>
