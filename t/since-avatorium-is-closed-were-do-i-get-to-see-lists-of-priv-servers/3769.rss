              <p>Avatorium is NOT closed.<br>
Phate is trying to find some other host. But he can’t <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
And he doesn’t want to pay any money.</p>
<p>But, to continue with the host he has right now, he needs to pay the guy $15. He said no way, so they suspended his account.</p>
<p>Now, if anybody has $15 they want to donate to Phate, feel free to PM me if you want to do that.<br>
I can get you in contact with him <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
