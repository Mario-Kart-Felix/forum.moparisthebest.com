[B][U]Welcome to our Project Thread!
[/U][/B]
[B][U]Well First things first, Here is an introduction to why I want to start this Project:[/U][/B]

Around 2 months ago I started a small pk server, Used Factor-Zero as my base and coded from there. I got pretty far for being I was only advertising on a small community. Now that I am back, I want to develop something greater than just a small server. I want to take my server to the top 10, I know these are big goals, but you have to set them in order to achieve them. I believe I can do it with some help.

[B][U]Secondly, Some information about me.[/U][/B]

My Name is Jake, I have been in the rsps community since I was 12, So for 5 years since I am 17 now. I have learned all the basics of coding but I will admit to using tuts for most of my stuff. I have not learned the Java Language efficiently but I plan on it. I plan on doing alot to the server and to my player base.

[I]Server Base: PI - Factor-Zero due to I like their client base. By the time Im done with it, It will look nothing like it.[/I]

[B][U]Server Development TO-DO List:[/U][/B]
- Add ALL Standard Minigames
- Add Curses
- Add PvP Drops
- Add EP System
- Make an efficient Highscore via MYSQL
- More Shops
- Ancient Artifacts
- Dicing ( I have only seen this command wise, Im talking about the models and everything)
- Much Much More!

[B][U]What I have done so far:[/U][/B]
- Added in the standard Donor Points and Donator Zone
- Fixed a couple of client bugs
- Fixed the buy bug
- Created the webclient (So easy that it Shouldnt be here)
- Added in a couple custom items
- Integrated my characters to my vBulletin

[B][U]What I have done with the website:[/U][/B]
- Added vBulletin
- Made custom webclient page
- Integrated Server
- Still looking for more ideas.

[B][U]Conclusion:[/U][/B]
Well, Seriously I need help, I cant do this by myself, It really is a pain when It is only me doing shit for the server. If you can help me in any way, I would deeply appreciate it.

              <p>Good luck! You might wanna add the main focus of the game (generally “We mainly focus on the players!”). I love your thought that you have to set big goals in order to achieve them.</p>

Are these 'updates' really worth posting?
Anyways, goodluck.
