    <title>[request] a request tutorial thread!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-a-request-tutorial-thread/34674</link>
    <description>Ok I and I think everyone else is sick of having noobish requests on the Tutorials Section and I might be a junior member but I think I have a right to be mad. Nobody likes going to a Tutorials section and finding tuts like &quot;Help Plz!!&quot; or need a tutorial or something that isnt related to private server tutorials. That is why I suggest An admin or global mod or w/e make s a Request[TUT] Thread or something like that. That way people who are new to this mopar or are members that are just too damn stupid to post in the correct section this might help them and probably stop alot of flaming cuz I see it the most in Those Help topics in tutorials Thank you for your time in reading this if u did
