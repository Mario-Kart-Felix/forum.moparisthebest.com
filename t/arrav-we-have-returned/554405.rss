[B][I]Yes, we are using the Arrav name. No, we&#39;re not the owners of Arrav that shut down the server three times on their players and then twice more when they ran Ikov. We are simply people who enjoyed playing Arrav when it was online and wanted to provide the same environment once again for players to enjoy. We&#39;ve got a fresh Economy going and we&#39;re working toward perfecting the server content in an attempt to provide you with optimal game-play.[/I][/B]

              <p>I’ve always noticed a theme in advert threads where they list all the features that either came with their base or every other sever has and then saying “and so many more unique things” right after. They never list the stuff that sets them apart.</p>
<p>Either way, I enjoyed arrav briefly before, so maybe I’ll give it a chance.</p>
