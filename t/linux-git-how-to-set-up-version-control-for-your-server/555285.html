        <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I guess the the first thing I should say,<br>
is version control is a whole new concept for many of the users in the rsps community, it’s an amazing concept and works wonders.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Story:</span><br>
I’ve been a fullstack perl  developer for about 2 years, (that means I develop in Perl, MySQL, and Front end Languages, Html, CSS)<br>
and between then and now we’ve used 2 separate version control softwares, CVS, and Git.</p>
<p>When we swapped to Git I didn’t like it, and this reason was simply familiarity, and understanding the different concepts between Git and CVS.<br>
I’ve been using git daily for about a year, and I feel like it is so far advanced compared to it’s successor, CVS.<br>
I highly recommend Git for your version control software. It allows branches, as well as control of multiple files, in a single commit.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">So I’m going to be explaining two concepts, an alpha, staging, and live environment, as well as a version control and how to use them together.</span></p>
<p>[hr]<br>
[size=24pt]Note: [/size][size=18pt]This article assumes you have basic knowledge of how to move around linux via command line, and have very basic administrative skills with linux, and that you perhaps have some version of a linux environment set up.[/size]<br>
[hr]</p>
<p>[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Is this a copy paste article</span><br>
Certainly not, it’s very much a higher level concept</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is an Ideal setup?</span><br>
There is so many ways to set up git and because of this it’s hard to say what a standard should be for runescape private server, so here is a few options for your server.<br>
[hr]</p>
<p>[size=24pt]<span class="bbcode-b">1:</span> [/size]here is the Ideal case<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">To Owners</span><br>
You have 3 “servers”, a “master”, “beta” and an “alpha” server.<br>
Have your developers work from their alpha environment, an alpha environment can be their own space on your server, on their own server, or it can be their computer. Ideally, it is not on the same server as the live server, you don’t want your beta or alpha environments to affect your live environment.<br>
Developers Work on code on their alpha, test it themselves, move it to a beta environment for more thorough testing, and then finally to live in front of the players.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">To Developers: </span><br>
When you’ve decided a feature is “Code Complete”, and you as a developer has tested it on your “alpha”, then you’ll commit the code to your branch, when your “tester” is ready someone (the tester or the dev) can merge it in to beta, if it fails you can roll back the beta changes and continue development on your “alpha” or if your “tester” has decided that it is “live” ready, someone can merge it to live.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What this means to me:</span><br>
3 servers is simply 1 VPS, with 2 virtualized systems, with a single server on each, the beta server runs on a separate port than the live server,<br>
and the alpha system is my own personal computer, keeps the systems from the chance to crash each other for any reason, and if there are memory leaks it’s easier to find.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Pros:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Less bugs make it to live[/li][/ul]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Cons:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Code gets to live slower.[/li][/ul]<br>
If you don’t have a tester, you as the developer is the tester and gate keeper between beta and live, test the code more fully.<br>
Owners can be the tester.<br>
[hr]<br>
[size=24pt]<span class="bbcode-b">2:</span>[/size] <span class="bbcode-b">Next best thing</span><br>
You the owner have 1 developer with little experience in development and want to try.<br>
You’ll have a live server, and an alpha, you trust your developers to test their code before releasing it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Pros:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Owners don’t blame developers for potential bugs, if they wanted it tested they should have found a tester[/li][/ul]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Cons:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]players abuse bugs until they are fixed[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[hr]<br>
[size=24pt]<span class="bbcode-b">3:</span>[/size] <span class="bbcode-b">Worse case scenario</span><br>
This unfortunately is the majority of the RSPS, What most people in the runescape private server community do.</p>
<p>Code in the live environment, test to see if the function they made works.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Pros:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Code gets out very quickly[/li][/ul]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Cons:</span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Lots of bugs make it to production[/li]<br>
[li]players abuse bugs until while developers are actively working creating the new feature[/li]<br>
[li]Often time this causes often but brief down time[/li]<br>
[li]Code gets out very quickly, often times untested.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[hr]<br>
[size=18pt]QA:[/size]<br>
[size=18pt]What is version control software?[/size]<br>
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]What is git?[/size]<br>
Unless you are not ready to read 5 pages to understand git conceptually, you are going to have a hard time understanding some of the more natural concepts.<br>
History, Branches, Repositories, Commits, Merges,<br>
<a href="https://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/</a></p>
<p>[size=18pt]How will it be beneficial to my server?[/size]<br>
There are a lot of benefits from using git,<br>
1: All version control software keeps a history of file changes, you can view the diff from the previous versions and once built out you’ll have a history<br>
to help you decide your servers future.<br>
2: Your developers don’t need to log in to your server to be able to make changes to your code.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Will it make my server faster?[/size]<br>
No, but it will help keep your server’s maintained.</p>
<p>It also has the hidden benefit of less bugs.</p>
<p>In short, you will be spending more time figuring out git, once you’ve learned git you will speed up your process significantly.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]what if we have multiple developers? how does this affect their work flow?[/size]<br>
In theory you would be working out of your own branches, and directory structures, either on your own computer, or in a separate folder path than the actual server, this allows you to make changes without affecting your “Live” environment. This way only the work you are ready to actually get to live will ever affect the other developers, you won’t have to worry about stepping on each others toes.</p>
<p>Also there is a huge benefit from having a second developer, before merging your commit to beta have the second developer look at your code and decide if there are any changes that need to be made.</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Conflicts[/size]<br>
In most cases, git will provide a way to view the difference between the conflicting versions, allowing you to make a choice. You can either edit the files manually to merge the options, or allow one revision to win over the other. You may want to collaborate with your other developer to make sure you’re not undoing their important work!</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Creating your git repo[/size]<br>
If you don’t have git installed, They have instructions for Linux, Mac, and Windows.<br>
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git</a></p>
<p>Fairly straight forward to set up your first git repo,<br>

<p>Once set up you can clone it to your own computer,</p>
<p>This is my mac</p>
<p>[code=bash]$ git clone ssh://username@hidden-hostname.com/home/user/full-path-to/git-repo<br>

In your .gitignore file, you should probably put your character files, you don’t need to be committing your players every time you commit,<code>Data/characters/</code>Also if you have any logs, you can put those logs in the .gitignore file as well<code>Logs/trade.log</code><br>
[hr]</p>
<p>from here you can add new files, commit files and push them to the server, and when you are ready merge in master.</p>

<p>Just what the company I work uses, haha I know other languages, I need to pickup Ruby and Python still at some point.</p>
<p>I have no formal development training, I basically moved up in the company from a technical support position, and when they hired me they said we know you don’t have schooling, but you are more qualified then the other people we interviewed.</p>
