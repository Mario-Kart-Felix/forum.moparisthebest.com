    <title>[PI] Help me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-help-me/417339</link>
    <description>Hey guys, just need a two things. ^^

1. I&#39;ve been working with Delta and current Switched to PI, in my Delta I had a ::help command with a coded yell which would yell to everyone &quot;Player has landed on help island&quot; I&#39;m just wondering if anyone knows what the yell code would be like on PI.

2. My client&#39;s background and login box is the old RuneScape log in (the one with the flames). I&#39;ve downloaded Tom&#39;s Cache Suit and it wasn&#39;t in there. Does anyone know how I can link it in with my sprites folder?

Thanks.</description>
