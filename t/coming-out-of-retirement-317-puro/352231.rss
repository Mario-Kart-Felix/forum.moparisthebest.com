    <title>Coming out of retirement! [317 Puro]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/coming-out-of-retirement-317-puro/352231</link>
    <description>Some of you might know about the minigame on RuneScape called Impetuous Impulses, also called Puro Puro.



For those who don&#39;t know what it is, I shall explain.  Puro Puro is a minigame were players move through the wheat fields catching imps, and catching an imp can cause a rare imp to spawn.  All imps spawn here, even Kingly and Dragon imps.



What I am working on at the moment:


Created a 9 Lane Maze [100%]
Added all Imp Models [100%]
Added all imp Animations [100%]
Added Spawn of Imps depending on what imps you catch [72%]
Added Catching chances depending on Hunting level and Thieving level [100%]
Removing imps after catching and spawning a new imp [100%]
Moving through the wheat faster depending on strength [90%]
Added loot for all Implings [100%]
Added Imp Jars [100%]
Added Magic Butterfly Net [60%]
Added Casting Bind, Snare, Entangle on imps [0%]

I am almost done, and I will post pictures soon.  I have noted percentages on my progress above, I will now explain some stuff.  At the moment, imp spawns are completely random, meaning if you catch a Tier 1-5 you can cause a rare imp to spawn, when it&#39;s supposed to be: Tier 1 spawns 1 or 2, Tier 2 spawns 1 2 or 3, Tier 3 spawns 1 2 3 or 4 Tier 4 spawns 1 2 3 4 5 Tier 5 spawns 1 2 3 4.  A Tier is a class/type for those who don&#39;t know.  Anyhow, I think I may have come up with a method just by adding a chance system.  Like when the player catches the imp, it gives a + or - chance depending on what imps are already in play.


I also have an idea, for members of the server that pay 50M.  It will allow them 30 Minutes of the minimap not being blackened and will allow them to see imps by colored map hints, kingly would be yellow/red.  And so on.




I hope you guys think this was a good idea...I think it is, simply because players would train hunting to catch these imps and sell them allowing the economy to flow, especially when you can get items like royal or uncut onyx, but that is rare.  So players could lose or gain money depending on what they get.  Also, the server gives players a challenge to make money and raise skills.  So I think kingly imps will be around 10M or 15M.  Not bad, but it is a lot of money basically.  Plus I plan on re-modeling the royal crown...Simply because it looks like brass...
