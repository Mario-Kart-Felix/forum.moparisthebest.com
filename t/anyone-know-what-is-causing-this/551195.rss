    <description>Using a non-renamed client. I don&#39;t have a clue what could possibly cause this:

Believe me, any help or guidance is greatly appreciated

[b]Edit: This has been fixed. It didn&#39;t have anything to do with the reading of the models. The glitch happens because the client is trying to draw an image thats bigger than the canvas, so its basically like drawing a picture and only been-able to fit half of it on your page.[/b]</description>

<p>If your client has a folder for models then  they could be replacing the original models that should be there.</p>
<p>If there is no such folder, it could be a cache reading problem (get the correct cache for your revision)</p>
<p>I have actually seen an issue like this before while playing RS. Try redownloading the cache.[/quote]<br>
Look at my original post, I state that I had fixed the problem and I even explained what was causing this problem. It had nothing to do with the models or the cache which is what I already expected. I may make a tutorial about this incase others run into this issue.</p>

<p>My guess would be there’s something wrong with reading the models. What exactly, I’m not sure.</p>
