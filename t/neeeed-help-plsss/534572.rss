              <p>Yeah, don’t change the extension and expect it to work. It can only be read by the application that created it. In your login/initialise method (where it says “Welcome to RuneScape.”), add a statement that checks for your name and setRights == 2, i.e.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (player.userName().equalsIgnoreCase("vonmister")) {
        player.getRights() == Rights.ADMINISTRATOR;
}</code></pre>
<p>The methods will of course be different in your source.</p>
