    <description>[b]This is a Compiler I used for My Client/Server and It works all the time. Those Perfect Compilers or Whatever you Noobs call it, Is really not that Perfect and don&#39;t think that if your Compiler is only like 7 Lines it sucks, Well it doesn&#39;t. To tell you the truth, The Perfect Compilers suck more, They have like 50 Lines of shit and This one I use is only 7 Lines and it works the same, If not better ;D[/b]

[b]Here it is-[/b]

@echo off[b](Keep this)[/b]
cls[b](Keep this)[/b]
title Pridescape Compiler [b](Change it to the Name of your Server or Client)[/b]
echo Its Compiling,W8 N00b[b](When you Run it will say whatever you put here, But don&#39;t Erase the echo)[/b]
&quot;%ProgramFiles%\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java[b](Keep this)[/b]
echo Finished Compiling.[b](Keep this)[/b]
pause[b](Keep this)[/b]

[b]You have to Download Java JDK 6u7 on the Link Here[/b]- http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
