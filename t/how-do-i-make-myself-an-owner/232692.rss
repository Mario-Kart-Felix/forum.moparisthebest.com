    <title>How do i make myself an owner?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-myself-an-owner/232692</link>
    <description>Alright, i have read answers on this question that i am having trouble with. But none of them are giving me what i need. They say to go to the folder that says &quot;characters&quot; which i do have, and then they say to go to the file you have for your name or something along those lines. I do not have that, can someone tell me how to make it to make myself owner? 

Thanks people.</description>

Go into char files find your guy and set your rights to 3, and you can go into client.java and search owner until you see somones name and put yours in</p>
<p>wait yeah its kind of right section i thought i was in tutorials sorry lol, but for server questions put it into rs2 server development/help</p>
