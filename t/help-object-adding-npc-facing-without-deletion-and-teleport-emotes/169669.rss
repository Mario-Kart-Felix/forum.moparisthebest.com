    <title>[HELP] object adding, npc facing (without deletion), and teleport emotes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-object-adding-npc-facing-without-deletion-and-teleport-emotes/169669</link>
    <description>i was wonderin if someone could help me with my server. I am trying to add obelisks of fire to the mage arena for a path to some jads im placing there, but i dont know the command/cfg to do it. also, i cant seem to get the tele emotes to the duel arena and the mage arena. here is what i have for the teles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;public void emoteBow() // Duel
{
	if(!isWild()) {
		tele(3343,3230);
                          sendMessage(&quot;Duel!&quot;); }
	else if (isWild()) {
		sendMessage(&quot;You must not be in a wilderness area.&quot;); }
}

public void emoteAngry() // Jad
{
             tele(3087,3933);
             sendMessage(&quot;You have now reached the Jad lair.&quot;); }
}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

finally, i have some heros at the ramp to the center to the mage arena, but they are facing south, not west like i want. where do i change the direction?

thx, R4ND0M</description>
