    <title>Problem with new server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-with-new-server/185893</link>
    <description>Hi, I was wondering if anyone can help me with a server online/offline problem. I was trying to register my server on the server status page but when I clicked &quot;Submit&quot; it told me my server was offline :mad:. And I had my Runserver file on and I port forwarded. My friend&#39;s were able to get on perfectly fine using silabs webclient. I just cant seem to get on my server using Moparscape. Can anybody help me?</description>
