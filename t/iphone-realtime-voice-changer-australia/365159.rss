    <title>iPhone realtime voice changer (australia)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/iphone-realtime-voice-changer-australia/365159</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m looking for a voice changer for my iPhone (change your voice during phone calls) for the obvious reason, prank calling friends.

I run a jailbroken, iOS4 iPhone. The problem is, I live in Australia and the programs available are for US/Canadians. Although there are ways to do it via an Aussie number, they charge international phone rates for the calls so it&#39;s out of the question.

Do you guys know of any that are available for Australians to make the calls for free and to Australian numbers?</description>
