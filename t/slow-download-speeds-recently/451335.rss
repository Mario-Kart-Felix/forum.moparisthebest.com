    <title>Slow download speeds recently?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/slow-download-speeds-recently/451335</link>
    <description>I have high speed internet w/ Road Runner, and my download speeds have recently (within the past week or two) dropped from an average of 300kb/s to sometimes only 5kb/s... it&#39;s really pissing me off. I called them &amp; at first she thought I said 5MB/s and then I told her again, KB, and she just had that like &#39;wtf...&#39; kinda voice. So they couldnt help me. Pissing me the fuck off. I pay extra to have HIGH SPEED internet, you know? So has this ever happened to anyone? If so, maybe even if not, how should I confront &amp; fix this shit?</description>

<p>You can also  ask for a network evaluation from  your  company(normally). Tell them that you have seen a decline in the speed and they will send out a techy to look at it. There may be a fee with that though.</p>

              <p>Reset your router, that will generally refresh your connection and give you better speeds.  Beyond that, are you downloading during peak hours (generally tends to affect your speeds pretty significantly, depending on where you live)?</p>
