    <title>[PI] Innovation PRO || Innovation, For the Players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-innovation-pro-innovation-for-the-players/437126</link>
    <description>Well, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been active on these forums at all. However I haven&#39;t stopped coding RSPS. for the past couple of weeks, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time gathering maps and data for a Project Insanity client, and I&#39;ve become satisfied with what I&#39;ve compiled. I actually have decided to code a server to correspond with the client. The client&#39;s features are personally the best I&#39;ve seen in a client, and I&#39;m hoping that the server will be just as good. This server and client will both be released upon completion of the server, and/or something else comes up.

[u][b][center]Current Features[/center][/b][/u]
[center]
[ul][li]Client loads 600+ Mapdata[/li]
[li]Client loads 525+ configuration data (items, NPC&#39;s, objects, etc..)[/li]
[li]Server is blank, project insanity.[/li][/ul]


Before I get to started on the server, I&#39;m going to be going through the project insanity server it&#39;s self, and picking out each and every bug I come across that may be in the skills, minigames, combat, and jotting them down and working to fix them in the end. I have plenty of ideas to keep the server easy to manage, both in game and out.
