              <p>Personally I believe at one time there was life on mars.</p>
<p>Have you seen the face on mars? And the pyramids? I mean basically the only thing Mars is currently lacking for life is an atmosphere and water. There is more proof everyday that there was once water, and that there could be oceans underneath the surface. Without an atmosphere the temperture average is -63° C (-81° F). It has even reached 20° C(68° F) before. If at some point in time, Mars did have an atmosphere, the temperture would be much warmer and I have no doubt that it would be suitable for life. And honestly I do kind of believe that millions of years ago there could have been a primitive humanoid type of population on mars.</p>
<p>And all the recent sightings are kind of freaking me out.</p>

<p>How about the 20 other people that saw it? And how about my first sighting in which I was completely sober with a friend who also saw it(and again like 20 people in town who saw it).</p>
<p>Even if I had video footage, it would have probably been passed off as fake. My friends will be going there prepared for now on incase of another sighting.</p>

<p>Seriously:<br>
We live in a gaxxy compiled of billions and billions of solar systems and in each solr system, there can be no planets of LOADS.<br>
So in billions and billions and billions of planets, how the hell is it possible that we are the only planet able to sustain life?</p>
<p>If you do think that, now think: Theirs trillions of galaxies.</p>
<p>It was also in the news someone found a planet which they said was very much like earth, had water etc i think aswell.</p>
<p>Tbh there has been too many sightings of Aliens and crap for them not to exist. Like they say with Jesus, ‘too many recorded documents to say he never existed’…lol</p>

<p>I was hoping maybe someone can give a logical explanation for two UFO sightings I have seen in the past month.</p>
<p>Ok I guess ~3 weeks ago, we were in a very very small farming community named Waltham. It was about 11 PM. I’m with my friend at “the tables”(theres a field with picnic tables and a small pond that we hang around). All of a sudden, a firey spinning object is twisting through the sky, going at least 500 times faster then any airplane would do. It was just going all through the sky, looked like some object on fire spinning around awkwardly. My friend saw it as well, and the next day it turns out a shit load of people saw it. No one in my hometown about 20 miles away saw anything(that I know of).</p>
<p>Ok then, about… A week later or so. Once again, at the tables and this time with many people. We were all stoned but no it wasn’t a hallucination. This time the firey object was not spinning, it was just going CRAZY FAST everywhere! I mean It’d go all over the sky in seconds. It lasted a good 5 minutes doing this. It was just nuts and I wish I had my video camera. Again, many people the next day claimed to see it. Everyone thinks it’s a UFO but I’m trying to find out a logical explanation.</p>
<p>I don’t know the details, but apparently there was an aircraft of some kind that crash landed in Waltham at one time, and disappeared with a trail of fire still there. That’s just rumors though.<br>
edit: Haha found some info on something similar: <a href="http://www.anomalies.net/archive/cni-news/CNI.0407.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.anomalies.net/archive/cni-news/CNI.0407.html</a><br>
Thats where we play paintball lol.</p>
<p>I know everyone’s gonna think I’m crazy now lol.[/quote]<br>

              <p>[quote=“jme_009, post:33, topic:135822”]I’ve never believed in aliens or anything of the sort, but lately there’s been fucked up shit in the sky.</p>
<p>I was hoping maybe someone can give a logical explanation for two UFO sightings I have seen in the past month.</p>
<p>Ok I guess ~3 weeks ago, we were in a very very small farming community named Waltham. It was about 11 PM. I’m with my friend at “the tables”(theres a field with picnic tables and a small pond that we hang around). All of a sudden, a firey spinning object is twisting through the sky, going at least 500 times faster then any airplane would do. It was just going all through the sky, looked like some object on fire spinning around awkwardly. My friend saw it as well, and the next day it turns out a shit load of people saw it. No one in my hometown about 20 miles away saw anything(that I know of).</p>
<p>Ok then, about… A week later or so. Once again, at the tables and this time with many people. We were all stoned but no it wasn’t a hallucination. This time the firey object was not spinning, it was just going CRAZY FAST everywhere! I mean It’d go all over the sky in seconds. It lasted a good 5 minutes doing this. It was just nuts and I wish I had my video camera. Again, many people the next day claimed to see it. Everyone thinks it’s a UFO but I’m trying to find out a logical explanation.</p>
<p>I don’t know the details, but apparently there was an aircraft of some kind that crash landed in Waltham at one time, and disappeared with a trail of fire still there. That’s just rumors though.</p>

With all fake videos that have been made of aliens nearly all of them take on that look. I think that there must have been a real alien sighting that looked like that… other wise where the heck did this image of an alien come from?</p>
