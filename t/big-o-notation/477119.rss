    <title>Big-O Notation</title>

    <description>I&#39;ve seen some people like t4, super_, Graham, etc. say that certain things are an O(1) or O(n) operation. I had no clue what this was so I did a quick google search, but I&#39;m still not fully understanding it?

Something like O(1) is constants so no matter the size it takes the same amount of time 

and 

O(n) is like the bigger the size the longer it will take?

I&#39;m just confused.</description>
