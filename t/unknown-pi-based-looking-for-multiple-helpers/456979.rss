    <title>[Unknown] ~ PI based ~ Looking for multiple helpers!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unknown-pi-based-looking-for-multiple-helpers/456979</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;ll start out by introducing myself and then list what I&#39;m going to need help with!

Name - Garrett

Age - 19

Coding Experience - I used to code back around I&#39;d say 2008-2009. Somewhere in that time range. I haven&#39;t coded in years, so I&#39;m looking to start coding again!

MSN - masterlop21@hotmail.com

Skype - master.lop



The Server:

The server will be a PI based server. The base - http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,542788.msg3978096.html#msg3978096

I will be editing it a little bit at a time!


What I&#39;m going to need for the server/forums:

A Coder/Development Team (Someone or multiple people to help me code the server) - [Currently None]

A Forum Guru (Someone who can help me setup the forums) - [Currently None]

Suggester(s) (Someone or multiple people to help suggest ideas to implement into the server as well as help me pick out a name for the server) - [Currently None]

Beta Tester(s) (someone or multiple people to help play the server and submit bugs and things like that) - [Currently None]


Application:

1. What position are you applying for?

2. Why do you want to become this position?

3. Will you stay with the server once it&#39;s finished?


Also if you want to, you can PM me or add me on MSN or Skype - Contact details located above.</description>
