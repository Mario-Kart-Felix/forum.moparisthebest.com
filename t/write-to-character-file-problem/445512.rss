    <title>Write to character file problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/write-to-character-file-problem/445512</link>
    <description>I am having a bit of trouble with a new public int in which i set up to write to my character file.
The integer in Player.java is as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;public int cooksAssistant = 0;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
When it writes to the character file it is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;cooksAssistan0&lt;/blockquote&gt;
If you need any more information to help, please request. In the meantime, somebody please give any idead as to why it is like this.</description>
