    <title>Script Involving a bit of Math</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/script-involving-a-bit-of-math/126326</link>
    <description>i play a game called conquer online and was interested if someone would be able to input a number (Current Experience and level ranging from 00.001 to 99.999 )
then based off this chart: (Experience balls per ball consumed) and price per ball and get an output
so simplified (i hope lol)
Input: Current Level 88-129 Current Xp (00.001-99.999) / Percent Each Ball Gives / and price per ball (normally in millions)
Output: Cost to Level and Amount of Balls needed

Level %/Ball consumed
88: +92.627%
89: +78.652%
90: +74.709%
91: +73.473%
