    <title>Best Colleges For Computer Programming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-colleges-for-computer-programming/133826</link>
    <description>Hey,

     I&#39;m only going into my freshman year in highschool, but I&#39;m usually the type of person that likes to prepare for everything. Since I was nine years old my dream was to become a software engineer. I know a few languages, and I&#39;m learning more right now. But, I just wanted to know peoples opinions on the best schools for this subject. I want to get my masters in computer programming. I get 8 free years tuition to any school in the US, so don&#39;t worry about prices. Location isn&#39;t an issue either, as long as it is in the US. Anyways, post your opinions.

Thanks,

Buzzy</description>

<p>I don’t know what your talking about tbh.  Because more students take the SAT, it is more important when measuring against other students.  When admissions officers are more interested in comparing student x to student y, odds are, both students took the SAT.  Therefore, they can accurately measure aptitude with SAT than ACT.</p>
<p>Of course, SAT measures more of how little friends you have, not exactly how well you’ll do in college, but whatever.  The entire college admissions process is broken, standardized tests are only moreso.</p>

<p>Most important thing is find something that you’re passionate about.  Computers, Greek, molecular biology, etc.  Despite what your teachers and parents tell you, colleges don’t want a well-rounded student.  They want one who is passionate about one thing.  They don’t want a jack of all trades, master of none.  They want someone who is focused and takes initiative.  Sports aren’t as important for Ivy Leagues, unless you are a pro and have grades to back it up.  Ivy Leagues can only bend so far to pick up a star athlete.  And tbh, GPA is so subjective.  Just shoot for all A+'s if you school has them, and if you fall short, maybe you’ll end up with only A’s?  Set high goals.  SAT’s are important.  They are the ultimate leveler, and the only way to improve your score is by brute force taking tests and analyzing each answer.</p>
<p>Yea, just all my regrets from high school.</p>

<p>On the SAT’s, the middle 50% of students got a 660-760 Critical Reading score and a 720-800 Math score.  So start working towards those 4’s.  And you need to be excellent otherwise; as you’ve heard, SAT’s aren’t everything, i.e. I got a 770 CR and 800 M (higher than 75% of their matriculating class), and I don’t think I stand a chance applying to MIT.</p>

              <p>Before college, I had always wanted to become a mechanical engineer, but after 2 years of college and ‘Differential Equations for Engineers’, which comes after the second worst class of Calculus 2.  I discovered that I would be just as happy majoring in Computer science, and would start out making about $30,000 dollars more a year than with a mechanical engineering degree.  So I switched majors and will therefore have to take an extra semester, but I guess in the end it will be worth it. Good luck in whatever you choose <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>But when applying for colleges, you do have to put down a tentative major (most colleges have an undecided option).  The first year, I believe, is mostly spent doing general courses and courses of personal interest…Cornell emphasizes the latter, and recommends going through their course catalog and just picking random courses that appeal to you for the first year.</p>
<p>What I meant about knowing what you want to do is that if you have a major/career plan in mind, you can choose the major you are going to stick with earlier on, and you can take advantage of internship, co-op, and research opportunities earlier as opposed to waiting when you do know what to do.  For most colleges, I would imagine that this is not a big deal - you have a few years to make up your mind and decided what to do.  But the upper colleges have such a competitive student body, that it is apparently difficult to do that (as I mentioned, this is what I was told…this part is not from experience).</p>

              <p>Hey,</p>
<pre><code> I'm only going into my freshman year in highschool, but I'm usually the type of person that likes to prepare for everything. Since I was nine years old my dream was to become a software engineer. I know a few languages, and I'm learning more right now. But, I just wanted to know peoples opinions on the best schools for this subject. I want to get my masters in computer programming. I get 8 free years tuition to any school in the US, so don't worry about prices. Location isn't an issue either, as long as it is in the US. Anyways, post your opinions.
