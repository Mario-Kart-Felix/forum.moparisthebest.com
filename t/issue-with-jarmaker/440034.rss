    <title>Issue with jarmaker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/issue-with-jarmaker/440034</link>
    <description>[s]Well this is sort of odd I have never had this error before. I have done literally hundreds of webclients.

On my XP machine I could jar and sign just fine. On windows seven though it will jar it just fine, but I can&#39;t sign it. Needs to be signed to be a webclient. 

Whenever I try to sign it it freezes that screen.[/s]

Never mind I think I know where I was  messing up now. You see in windows xp I could make the certificate in the  java bin folder. But it must not be accessible in win7. So  I just  made the certificate in  my documents and it seemed to fix it;)

sorry for the nooblet post lols.</description>

That’s only adding the requirements to start up the application, not put it on the web. Profit-- for you!</p>

In Windows Vista/7 there are many protected folders that you need administrator privileges to access. Its just a small tool to prevent viruses. Just run JARMaker as admin to solve that :P[/quote]actually it was saying   i couldn’t  find  the jarmaker  jar when i did that  with a batch file <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
