    <title>How do I run RSC with plain old JDK... [solved]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-run-rsc-with-plain-old-jdk-solved/416250</link>
    <description>[s]Hello, I have recently decided to go back to RSC server development I know there is a way because I have done it before, to run the project without having to have apacheant or whatever and just use JDK, It has been a while though and I forgot how I did it the last time. I&#39;ve been looking all over for how with no luck but I [i]know [/i]it [i]is[/i] possible... If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be very much appreciated. Thank you for reading!  ;)[/s]

Edit: Never mind. I just decided to download the ANT program and use that. It wasn&#39;t all that hard.</description>
