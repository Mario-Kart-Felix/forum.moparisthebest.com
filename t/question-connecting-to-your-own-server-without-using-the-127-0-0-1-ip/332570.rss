    <title>[QUESTION]Connecting to your own server without using the 127.0.0.1 IP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-connecting-to-your-own-server-without-using-the-127-0-0-1-ip/332570</link>
    <description>Hello, This may seem like a very stupid question. But I really need to know if my server works or not. So here&#39;s the problem:

I am using RSCD as a base for my server and client.
I compile the server and client for my changes to take affect, then I run the server. I changed the server source so that it starts automatically without the need to press the &quot;Start Server&quot; button (this is so if my server computer shuts down or restarts the server can turn on right when it turns on again because I put it in the startup folder.)

Then I run the client with the 127.0.0.1 IP set in the settings.ini, the problem with this is that it is only localhost and I know for sure that if I run the server then I can connect with localhost, but I have no idea if other people can connect! So I tried changing the IP to my own IP to see if it could connect by going through the internet first and then reaching the server so I would know if others that are not on my network could connect. The problem I got was that it simply did not connect and in the logs it said that the session was rejected. I have been working on this server for a while now and never thought of if people would be able to connect, so maybe it was just a careless mistake in my code, but I searched it all and found nothing. 

If any of you have found this problem please tell me, and if this is just happening because you can&#39;t connect to your own server without using localhost then can some one tell me a place i could use to find out if it works... Thank you.

EDIT:
Well I have no Idea how I can see if it works, so can someone try it out? Here&#39;s the link:

http://host-a.net/Brother156/ChaoDragonOnline.zip

and my IP is: **.**.***.***
By the way, don&#39;t get intimidated and think there is a virus of some sort just because I have only a couple of posts. I have been on these forums for a very long time now, so you can trust me.

I don&#39;t have a virus scan at the moment though...

EDIT again:
The server might turn off because I got to go now, and my mom might turn it off or something so see ya!

EDIT 3:
I edited out my IP, but what is wrong with other people knowing it? Anyone can get it by any simple means such as website logging.</description>

              <p>Hello, This may seem like a very stupid question. But I really need to know if my server works or not. So here’s the problem:</p>
<p>I am using RSCD as a base for my server and client.<br>
I compile the server and client for my changes to take affect, then I run the server. I changed the server source so that it starts automatically without the need to press the “Start Server” button (this is so if my server computer shuts down or restarts the server can turn on right when it turns on again because I put it in the startup folder.)</p>
<p>Then I run the client with the 127.0.0.1 IP set in the settings.ini, the problem with this is that it is only localhost and I know for sure that if I run the server then I can connect with localhost, but I have no idea if other people can connect! So I tried changing the IP to my own IP to see if it could connect by going through the internet first and then reaching the server so I would know if others that are not on my network could connect. The problem I got was that it simply did not connect and in the logs it said that the session was rejected. I have been working on this server for a while now and never thought of if people would be able to connect, so maybe it was just a careless mistake in my code, but I searched it all and found nothing.</p>
<p>If any of you have found this problem please tell me, and if this is just happening because you can’t connect to your own server without using localhost then can some one tell me a place i could use to find out if it works… Thank you.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Well I have no Idea how I can see if it works, so can someone try it out? Here’s the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://host-a.net/Brother156/ChaoDragonOnline.zip" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://host-a.net/Brother156/ChaoDragonOnline.zip</a></p>
<p>and my IP is: <strong>.</strong>.***.***<br>
By the way, don’t get intimidated and think there is a virus of some sort just because I have only a couple of posts. I have been on these forums for a very long time now, so you can trust me.</p>
<p>I don’t have a virus scan at the moment though…</p>
<p>EDIT again:<br>
The server might turn off because I got to go now, and my mom might turn it off or something so see ya!</p>
<p>EDIT 3:<br>
I edited out my IP, but what is wrong with other people knowing it? Anyone can get it by any simple means such as website logging.</p>
