    <title>Making Client With One File Progress</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-client-with-one-file-progress/71267</link>
    <description>Ok So I just started to make my server from scratch with one file. The reason is that, for my ideas to possibly be made in any other server, i would have to delete, just about 1/2 of everything, recode it, add it again, etc. So i decided to make my own. This Is Just a prgress log on.. well my prorgess. Dont Spam, and i can post this here. So Here it Is:

ZymusScape Server Progress:

Client: 4%
Guilds: 23%
Mini-Games: 0%
Quests: 3%
Skills: 12.5%

Im Always working. so i shoud be done in about 2 months, probably less.</description>
