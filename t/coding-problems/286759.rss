Im bored and got nothing better to do.<br>
Heres a short tutorial.<br>
How do you put teleports in the emote tab. Use texthandler.java<br>
and to make teles work use clickingmost.java</p>
<p>How do i spawn npcs<br>
Use your autospawn.cfg file to spawn<br>
Just copy one of the other codes in the autospawn text and paste it at the bottom of autospawn text. But right before [END OF NPC LIST] or what ever it is and then just change the first numbers you see to and npc id you want.<br>
And next 2 sets of numbers are choords.<br>
Explained that easy as possible lol^^</p>
<p>How do i put bank booths in a specific area?<br>
Go into your client.java<br>
And search makeglobal<br>
If your asking how do i search Push Ctrl + f and type makeglobal or whatever your looking for , methods, commands,ect…</p>
<p>How do i make teleport commands?<br>
Add them under a command.<br>
At first you can use a command generator but i wouldnt reccomend it since you wont learn shit.<br>
How do i make wilderness?<br>
Do you mean safe or wildy?<br>
If you want wildy remove the code telling it to be safezone.</p>
