    <description>ya, so I&#39;m trying to teach myself how to code through use of guides, yet I do have problems. 

Mostly, the stuff I edit in/add to the Client.java file, don&#39;t take effect in the actual server. I tried adding teleport commands to the file, and i tried a few different formats, yet none of them worked. I also tried editing the login message, yet that didn&#39;t work either. I&#39;m starting to think that the stuff I edit in the client.java file just don&#39;t work.

Anyone know what might be the problem?

I&#39;m using the ddsspeced v1.0 source, and before you say it, yes, I did compile after saving the file and before running the source again.

I think it might just be client.java because I can edit whats in the shops, item stats, autospawn, and npc drops.</description>
