<p>Look’s like either the model is broken, or corrupted.</p>
<p>You’ll have to fix it. How? I’m not sure. I wasn’t big into the custom model thing.[/quote]<br>
Quite simple actually.</p>
<p>What it looks like to me, is a new model got put in place of the dh’s wield model.</p>
<p>Here’s what I suggest:<br>
Find out what model number the DH uses for the wield models (there might be a male and female, so you have to check both). I made a snippet on dumping the data in the private server client hacking, I’m not sure of the link though.</p>
<p>Look in your cache for a “raw” folder. If it exists, search for the ids you got earlier.<br>
If you get results that are .dat’s or .gz’s, try removing them from the folder… Note: I didn’t say delete.<br>
Now try loading up your client again and see what the DH looks like.</p>
<p>The .dat’s (or .gz) you just removed had a purpose, probably. So you need to figure out what.</p>
<p>Try looking in the ItemDef file (may be named Class8, ItemDef_2, or similar) for the same IDs.<br>
This time if you find it, you need to change the values to something else… A number that isn’t being used would be best.<br>
Now, at the same time. Rename the .dat’s (or .gz) to the same values.</p>
<p>Save the item def and put the files back into the cache.<br>
Compile and run, and it should be good to go.</p>
