    <title>Port forward or server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forward-or-server/240998</link>
    <description>Well I had problems with my ISP for about 1 month.
I phoned them and they told me to follow their steps carefully, so I did.
They said any ports you forwarded will be deleted I said that&#39;s fine I know how to port forward I done it for years. So I done as he said to speed my download speed up and it worked, but now every time I try and port forward it will not let me. Any ideas?</description>
