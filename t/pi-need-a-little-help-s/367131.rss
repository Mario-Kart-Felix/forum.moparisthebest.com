    <title>[PI] Need A Little Help :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-a-little-help-s/367131</link>
    <description>Hey,
So I decided to get back into RSPS&#39;s, and I remembered how on my old Delta I had a &quot;System Update In: (time)&quot; command that was like this

&quot;::update 600&quot; (600=seconds)

So yeah, now I have moved on to PI and I was wondering if someone could help me make that?
Just like the real runescape system update timer! That would be epic! :D


EDIT: Just to make sure you know, I&#39;m talking about the Yellow timer that pops up over the pm bar when an update is soon. :o</description>
