    <title>Attack ranges</title>

    <description>Hi,

I would just like a (hopefully) simple fix to the attack ranges of NPC&#39;s, i get melle based NPC&#39;s attacking me around 20 squares away, is there anyway to make them have to be facing me and next to me to attack? Also I noticed that when I click to attack an NPC with a weapon it takes around 1.5 seconds for me to attack and the NPC hits me instantly, If anyone knows how to fix this it will be much appreciated.

Thanks for your time.</description>
