    <title>Error with login</title>

    <description>Ok, so I&#39;m writing a framework from scratch(&quot;Scratch&quot;. Just a reworked winterlove login). I&quot;ve got the sidebars to load, but I think I&quot;m having a timing problem.

I&#39;m using a TimerTask for the initialize method(instead of it being constantly called in a process method), and when I set the repetitionTime to 2500(2.5 seconds), it loads the side icons, and does a quick sendMessage, but it doesn&#39;t stop. Every 2.5 seconds it does the same thing. Prints the same message. Now, I think the reason it&#39;s doing it is because I have the TimerTask cycle through all players, and if the player is not online, it calls initialize(). However, whenever I make the initialize() set player.isOnline(true); it doesn&#39;t call the sendMessage(or if it does, it&#39;s not showing it) and I get disconnected almost instantly.

IF you have any suggestions, please say so. I&quot;m probably going to upload a vid so you can see what is happening, because my explanation is not the best.</description>

              <p>I"m using a timertask, because i didn’t like “called every 500ms” run method. It just got filled up with too much useless code, and lagged the server. And that’s why I said “from Scratch”</p>
