              <p>Apparently the courses are watered down versions of what they actually teach. If you visit the coursera website, you can enroll in them. They typically offer two types of enrolment: assignment based, where you’re issued with assignments to complete and due dates etc, and non-assignment based, where you just watch the videos and complete the weekly tests.</p>
<p>At the end, you get a certificate with a disclaimer that basically says it isn’t worth anything at all.<br>
With that said, if you’re already in the industry then go wild – may as well take what you can get if it’s free. But it’s not a pathway into a career for those who don’t already have some kind of industry recognition in the form of a degree/diploma/etc.</p>

              <p>Rather exciting, though I wonder how much interaction you get with the course creators. I have used the iOS development course from Stanford via iTunes U and that was rather good, they provide you with the course material, assignments, etc, but you obviously do not have that interaction from the lecturers.</p>
<p>Also if anyone has not tried out any of the iTunes U stuff, there is some pretty good stuff on there, they have wrapped it up in a nice UI (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/j7X2v.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://i.imgur.com/j7X2v.jpg</a>) for the iPad and iPhone but you can download all the standard files from iTunes.</p>
<p>From how they describe this it seems to be a lot more involving than just getting access to course content, so that is good, with ‘guidance’ of professors and assistants. Regardless, it should still be good.</p>
