    <description>Since rene wont give me his im going to need some help.
 
Rene had his so the thing between equipment interface and item lost on death (show equipment tab) the middle one asked if you wanted a target. It would then have a arrow over the person in the game and on the minimap. So if you know how to do one like that lemme no (edgepvp source by demise)

Or if you know how to do a system basically the same thing but it only gives you a target in the wildy (used for a non pvp server) let me know</description>
