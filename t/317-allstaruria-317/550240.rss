more info check out the skills under ;
Farming:
There are now 7 diffrent paths.

Level 1 Bush - Example: Jangerberries, Dwellberries, Red Berries, White Berries, Poison Ivy &amp; more
Level 25 - Calquat Tree
Level 45 - Cactus
Level 53 - Herb Patch
Level 66 - Allotment - Example: Onion, Sweetcorn, Strewberry &amp; more! 
level 76 - Hops - Example : Hammerstone, Asgarnian, wildblood &amp; more!
level 91 - Bittercap mushroom

!! FARMING IS AUTO, NOT A CLICK SKILL LIKE IT WAS !!

All of them need 8 minutes to grow, But all of them have diffrent start timers.
Like: Bush starts at 7min, Calguat at 6:45min, Cactus at 5min. (--&gt; for example).
Each patch the XP will increase alot since I think farming is abit of a pointless skill.
If you are interested, try it yourself !

Pictures farming:

Mining:
Mining was like one purple rock, well I&#39;ve made it diffrent!

Copper ore - Level 1.
Iron ore - level 15.
Coal ore - level 30.
Gold ore - level 40.
Mithril ore - level 55.
Adamantite ore - level 70.
Runite ore - level 85.

Like farming, Mining is the same.
Mining is also an auto skill, But there one diffrent.
The &#39;resource&#39; can be depleted by an amount of time (10 seconds - 1minute).
If it&#39;s depleted NONE can mine from the ore.

Woodcutting &amp; Fletching &amp; Firemaking:

Woodcutting is an easy skill, You just go to a tree and click on the tree, You&#39;ll AUTO chop off some wood from the tree.
One diffrent is there, the tree will regrow with a random timer from 5 seconds up to 55 seconds and the timer is for all the trees the same.
You DONT NEED AN AXE!!!

Level 1: normal tree
Level 30: willow tree
Level 45: Maple tree
Level 75: Yew tree
Level 91: Magic tree

If you go to another tree, You&#39;ll also receive more XP, But each tree has an other regrow timer, like I said before!

Fletching:
You Need a knife for this skill.
You just click: Knife(log) + log(Knife) = Shortbow or Longbow

GUIDE:

<p>Alright, that’s what I thought.

              <p>[quote=“Soulcist, post:4, topic:550240”]I’m a little confused on what you’re talking about some of these skills being an auto skill. Things like mining, fishing and so on are auto skills but without banking. You will get the fishes until either you run out of inventory space, the location of the spot moves to another one (more so for bots in this case), random event etc., but are you saying that when your inventory is full that it’ll bank etc.? I’m confused.[/quote] what it means is : in first case you had to click everytime on the fishing spot , mining spot or thief stall . now you have to click one time on one of those spots till it disapears doesnt mean that it stops till you have a full bag ! (its just not like bots) sometimes you get one fish and the spot disappears and sometimes you get like 7 fish till the spot is gone , its just the real thing <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> also not autobanking , you need to bank the items by yourself !!</p>

Farming:<br>
There are now 7 diffrent paths.</li>
</ul>
<p>Level 1 Bush - Example: Jangerberries, Dwellberries, Red Berries, White Berries, Poison Ivy &amp; more<br>
Level 25 - Calquat Tree<br>
Level 45 - Cactus<br>
Level 53 - Herb Patch<br>
Level 66 - Allotment - Example: Onion, Sweetcorn, Strewberry &amp; more!<br>
level 76 - Hops - Example : Hammerstone, Asgarnian, wildblood &amp; more!<br>
level 91 - Bittercap mushroom</p>
<p>!! FARMING IS AUTO, NOT A CLICK SKILL LIKE IT WAS !!</p>
<p>All of them need 8 minutes to grow, But all of them have diffrent start timers.<br>
Like: Bush starts at 7min, Calguat at 6:45min, Cactus at 5min. (–&gt; for example).<br>
Each patch the XP will increase alot since I think farming is abit of a pointless skill.<br>
If you are interested, try it yourself !</p>
<p>Pictures farming:<br>

<img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/ve3jn.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Mining:<br>
Mining was like one purple rock, well I’ve made it diffrent!</p>
<p>Copper ore - Level 1.<br>
Iron ore - level 15.<br>
Coal ore - level 30.<br>
Gold ore - level 40.<br>
Mithril ore - level 55.<br>
Adamantite ore - level 70.<br>
Runite ore - level 85.</p>
<p>Like farming, Mining is the same.<br>
Mining is also an auto skill, But there one diffrent.<br>
The ‘resource’ can be depleted by an amount of time (10 seconds - 1minute).<br>
If it’s depleted NONE can mine from the ore.</p>
<p>Mining Place Picture:<br>
<img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/zv1wl4.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Woodcutting &amp; Fletching &amp; Firemaking:</p>
<p>Woodcutting is an easy skill, You just go to a tree and click on the tree, You’ll AUTO chop off some wood from the tree.<br>
One diffrent is there, the tree will regrow with a random timer from 5 seconds up to 55 seconds and the timer is for all the trees the same.<br>
You DONT NEED AN AXE!!!</p>
<p>Level 1: normal tree<br>
Level 30: willow tree<br>
Level 45: Maple tree<br>
Level 75: Yew tree<br>
Level 91: Magic tree</p>
<p>If you go to another tree, You’ll also receive more XP, But each tree has an other regrow timer, like I said before!</p>
<p>Fletching:<br>
You Need a knife for this skill.<br>
You just click: Knife(log) + log(Knife) = Shortbow or Longbow</p>
<p>GUIDE:</p>
<p>TYPE LOG =============== LEVEL ===================== SHORTBOW OR LONGBOW</p>

Magic                      92                        LONGBOW</p>
<p>Firemaking:<br>
You need a tinderbox + log than the fire will come:</p>
<p>TYPE LOG =============== LEVEL</p>
