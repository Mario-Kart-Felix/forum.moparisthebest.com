    <title>Looking for a developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-developer/550683</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, this may or may not be in the correct thread, but please move accordingly as I didn&#39;t know where to put it other than here.

As the title says, I&#39;m looking for a developer to host a Runescape Private Server with me, as I have little knowledge of Java, but would love to own one.

The VPS will be bought today c: I can also make the website, as I have had a lot of experience with Website Hosting myself.

If you&#39;re interested please add my Skype - matthewkemp18

(I also don&#39;t want you to feel like you&#39;re the only one working on the client &amp; server, so i&#39;d like you to teach me some things so we can cooperate with each-other without you doing all the server/client work)

Thanks again!</description>
