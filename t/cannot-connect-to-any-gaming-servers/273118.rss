    <title>Cannot Connect To Any Gaming Servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cannot-connect-to-any-gaming-servers/273118</link>
    <description>Just as the topic says, i am unable to connect to any server for weeks. I tried games like rumble fighter, Silkroad, Conquer Online, stick arena ballistic. all these games i tried, i cannot connect to any of them. my firewall is on, but even when i turn it off, it still wont work. i&#39;ve tried port forwarding and all those others like cmd where i typed in netsh ip sumthing sumtin but none work. i am using a dsl and the modem number is westell 6100. my computer is toshiba satellite with intel, 4bg 800MHz SDRAM and 250GB HDD. any help please? the only game that i am currently able to play is runescape and dragonfable. also some games on mofunzone which does not have multiplayer.

i think this problem starts happening when i uninstalled norton antivirus, but i&#39;m not sure since i can still play these games at my friend&#39;s house by using his wireless network.</description>
