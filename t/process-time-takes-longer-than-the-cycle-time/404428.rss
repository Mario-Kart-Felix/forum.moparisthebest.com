    <title>Process time takes longer than the cycle time</title>

    <description>Hi, I haven&#39;t touched a private server in quite awhile, but I&#39;ve decided I want to take one on, anyways, my life story aside, I&#39;m having problems with the server taking longer than the set cycle time to process. 

My servers cycle time is set at 500ms which is .5 seconds but it&#39;s taking around 600ms to process. It&#39;s a 474 protocol server if that helps at all. 

The time taking to process vary&#39;s. It just clocked in at 3000ms!!

I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not my computer specs:
2.8Ghz Pentium III dual core
4GB DDR3

It might be a background program that&#39;s slowing it down, or could be a common problem with Rs2 severs, but I&#39;m not sure, as I haven&#39;t done this in awhile. If someone could give me a list of common programs that could conflict with this, or hint me at a solution, that would be great!</description>

<p>I don’t think it should, but I don’t think it would hurt. What base is it?</p>

<p>I think it’s a common problem with servers.</p>
<p>I believe the “official” cycle time is 600ms. How many players are online when you’re testing?</p>
