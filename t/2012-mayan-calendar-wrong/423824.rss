    <description>http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3972981/Mayan-2012-end-of-world-prophecy-wrong.html

<p>Yeah, thats pretty much i was saying, i was telling what i thought <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
I don’t think anybody can predict a correct date (agreeing with you)<br>
But i do think that the world will some day end in Armageddon (not the jesus battle stuff) it just means the earth will be in total anarchy and engulfed in flames, therefore killing everybody.<br>

What i mean is something is going to happen to wipe out the human race and other living creatures on earth, like another ice age for example.[/quote]</p>
