<p>Oh dear… You are the types of people who really need to get a life. Yes we understand he may have stolen it from somebody, but that does not mean you should go telling him to suck a cock… You are probably sick and tired of those who are not good at coding/making websites. Well if your so sick of them that you feel you need to criticize in that manner, <span class="bbcode-b">then you should do people a favor and actually give useful feedback to those who are beginners. If you do give useful feedback instead of telling people to go suck a cock or tell them that their work down right sucks, you may just find less people struggling in this community. Makes sense eh?</span><br>
So next time think about what your a saying, and whether your post actually is going to help others or not. If it is just a worthless post like the ones you have posted, then you really should not be in a community of programmers. The community’s purpose is to help each other learn and grow in their knowledge of the subject. And you are no “l33t” coder yourself…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>One, fuck you. Two, the door swings both ways buddy. Giving incorrect information to a person, and inaccurately critiquing someones work hurts them a lot more than what I do. You’re a prime example of that case. Three, don’t fucking talk to me condescendingly. I’m not a child. I know exactly what I’m doing and where I’m at. I’ve been here long enough to know exactly how this community operates. Did I say I am a ‘leet’ coder? No I did not. You surely do not know the purpose of this community.[/quote]</p>
<p>Obviously you do not know how it operates. If you did you would help others, and not make them worse with your worthless insults. And really you do not insult me at all. You may not physically be a child, but you do act like one. That is the reason why I am not insulted by anything you say. It is meaningless to me. I could care less if you were nice or a dick to me. It is just common sense that if you are so fed up with the “newbies” around here who are trying to learn, you would help get rid of them by giving useful feedback that helps them learn from their mistakes so that they can change it in the future. But with a half open mind like yours, that is too hard. And it does not matter if you said the words “I am a l33t coder,” or not. It is through your worthless and meaningless posts that shows us all that you think you are, indeed, a “l33t” coder. Or at least think of yourself to highly to use common sense in a situation as this. So please do this community a favor, and leave. You are doing not yourself, nor anyone else any good. You and everyone else that is to stupid, and thinks of themselves to highly to give a damn about the quality of their posts and feedback are what make a community crash. And your words do go against each other. You said that I do not know what this community is about. Well if the case is that the rest of this so called “community” acts the way you do, then it is surely not a community. A community is a group of people who work together to build themselves up amongst the other communities. There is no such “community” as the one you described in your post due to the fact that if every individual acted the same way you did, they would not be building each other up. They would be so self absorbed that they would tear each other down, not helping anyone, not even themselves. So please for now on, make sure you do know what you are talking about, and make sure that you put more work into the quality of your posts.</p>

              <p>It looks nice, but just a little advice… Never use the smfforfree or freeforums or any of that stuff… It is better to just get a free domain with cPannel and install SMF, PHPBB or VBulliten on your own… It takes almost no time at all and you have alot more freedom when you do it.</p>

This is one of the few things that I have to agree with ThAt0n36Uy on…  If your gona leech a bunch of people’s scripts</p>
<ol>
<li>Dont jack the script up (your agreement page)</li>
<li>Dont use SMFforFree</li>
<li>At least add a simple html file or something…<br>

nothing wrong with smfforfree.[/quote]</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a lot wrong with using it. As Thug-life said, no site ever hosted on smfforfree has ever had any real purpose. Most of the business smfforfree gets is from MoparScapers. Anyone is capable of entering a small bit of information into a text box and hitting submit. When you truly want an important website, you make it yourself, not register with a free forums website.</p>
