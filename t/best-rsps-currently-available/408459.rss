    <title>Best RSPS currently available?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-rsps-currently-available/408459</link>
    <description>Hey guys, haven&#39;t been too active for ages really. Just wanted to know what is in your opinion the best server currently as i can&#39;t decide using these shabby top 100&#39;s and stuff when they force there users to vote for them... I was used to playing servers like battlescape, pkisle, lembypk etc. Old school but AMAZING servers. Anyone got any reccomendations for me? Please don&#39;t post ones that require you to donate for items as i think this is cheap.</description>

              <p>Well to be quite honest, I’ve heard a lot about this server named Creative-Scape and thought the server was a pure enjoyment because the game frame, items and all that other good stuff is pure 317. When I went online because of it not having all those neat items and what not, about 90-100 players on the server were online, but it’ll grow.</p>

Well… its your opinion tbh. But today, the updates and features are much better, but the community overall is more obnoxious and kiddy like.</p>

              <p>It mainly died because those developing grew sick of making updates to server’s cause they could make ten time’s as much for half the work making app’s and stuff like that.

Oh well though, I have a feeling RSPS’s will be dying off more soon anyway since they’re getting old.</p>
