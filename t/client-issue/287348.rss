    <title>Client Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-issue/287348</link>
    <description>After I had made a client into a jar file and had put it on my website as a webclient, I recived this:
[i]image deleted[/i]

I&#39;m not quite sure on how to fix this. I would Appreciate Help or even an idea.

Edit: Picture removed, problem resolved.</description>
