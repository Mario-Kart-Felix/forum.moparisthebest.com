    <title>Java noob requires install assistance</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-noob-requires-install-assistance/153569</link>
    <description>Ok I&#39;m sorry I have to ask this but I&#39;ve tried tutorial and tutorial and tutorial, I&#39;m trying to get Crimson Editor to work on my comp for school, this boards tutorial helped me get to where it actually recognizes thers a JDK on my system and can actually compile stuff. So I go to run my script and the T/IO screen pops up for a second, dissappears and then I&#39;ve got nothing, Some help for mega noob here would be greatly appreciated.
thats been fixed.

So I changed a bit of my Script around, went to compile, now it reads everything super quick - Am i being stupid and missing a step here? :confused:
Your time is appreciated.
