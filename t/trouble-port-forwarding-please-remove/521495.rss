    <title>Trouble Port-Forwarding (PLEASE REMOVE)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trouble-port-forwarding-please-remove/521495</link>
    <description>!PLEASE REMOVE!  I GOT IT WORKING~!~
(I had the 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.11 switched around and I got it working)

I am having some trouble port-forwarding. I have already gone through the process of NO-IP and everything but this is the problem I am encountering. Whenever I try to sign into my server from my client it says &quot;Error connecting to server.&quot; so I checked my port on Canyouseeme.org but I got an error saying &quot;Connection Refused.&quot;

All the information I can give you:
