    <title>Need Album Art Maker! :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-album-art-maker/535072</link>
    <description>Hi! My band and I have created our first album and since none of us are capable of creating a legitimate album cover, we are dependent on you!

Our band name is &quot;IevaLaveI&quot; without the quotes.

The album is named &quot;Dance of Frost&quot;

I would like our band name to go at top-center and in white coloring with an elegant font. (please make it very soft)

I would like the album name to go in the bottom right corner in the same font as the band name, however a bit darker in color.

I would prefer the background to be from top to bottom: a night sky, the moon in the vanishing point of the art, a large amount of dead trees somewhat covering the moon and the entire middle of the art, at the bottom, let there be the beginning of a puddle and the end of the image cuts it off. (i would like the puddle to have a reflection of the moon and trees please)

Alright if anyone is able to do this, I will be in their debt greatly. &lt;3 to all.</description>
