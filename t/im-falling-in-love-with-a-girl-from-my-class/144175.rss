              <p>I’m thinking the same thing as nohope, I don’t believe you’re in love. What you definitely shouldn’t do is walk over to the girl and say “I love you” because that will creep her out (that would creep anyone out). Just go talk to her once you feel comfortable doing it. There’s not much more we can tell you, it’s really in your hands.</p>

              <p>its possible, but<br>
a) im sure your being shallow. do you know here? or do you just know shes hot<br>
b) your probably around middleschool. most girls are pretty uncomfortable to date around then and im sure shes not in love with you. what are the chances?</p>

<p>I’d do the same, no doubt. :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Anyway, odds are you’re 13 or 14 - around that age group. Probably just infatuation. I really don’t think it’s possible to love someone when you’re that age.</p>
