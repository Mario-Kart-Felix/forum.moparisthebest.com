    <title>Making a client with D cape + claws etc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-client-with-d-cape-claws-etc/337435</link>
    <description>I want to make a 317 pvp client (like massacred world, bringing back memories, unfortunately got legal issues with no-ip). So it works fine in silabclient but when i get d claws it comes up with &quot;other&quot; items. Well, i know about that, so how would i make my own client with customs? Like, changing the IP of the client so when logging on it goes to my server.

Will be great and Rep! Lots of detail please im a noobie!</description>
