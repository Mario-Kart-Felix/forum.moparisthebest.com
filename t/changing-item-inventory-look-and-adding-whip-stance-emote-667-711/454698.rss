    <description>hi,

i was wondering if some1 knows how to change the item looks in your inventory and how to add whip stance emote. i added some recolours to my server and replaced nulls with the recolours, but now the inventory looks like nulls, also when i wear the recoloured whip, it doesnt move like a normal one, when u attack and stuff the emotes work but just stance doesnt. also i tried searching 4151 (whip id) everywhere but could find stance emote. please help me and get off with stuff like use the searchbar and shit because i couldn&#39;t find anything.

thanks :)

EDIT: i already fixed the inventory stuff, still need the whip stance stuff thou.
EDIT EDIT: i also need to fix the special attacks and stuff</description>
