I&#39;d like to give you all a first welcome to the first step in reviving our server, Battle-Ages.

We will also have slight usergroup changes, I&#39;ll have the whole hierarchy of the staff and their roles in a thread. With all of that said, as you can tell, even though the forums are completed, to an extent, the server is currently in development. I got the forum up running earlier for you guys so you can sit around, chat, give feedback and suggestions, and all of that good stuff. This way we can also have a little place for all of the excited members waiting to play the server again all collaborate here.


If you have any questions, concerns, or ideas, please feel free to PM Me. We will all be working together to bring Battle-Ages back to it&#39;s former glory. If you have any suggestions for the forums or the upcoming server, you may gladly place them in the suggestions forum
Donations can be done through the forums, or by clicking the &quot;Donate&quot; button on the navigation bar. Full permanent donator status is only $5 USD! You will get the status on the forums instantly, however to claim in-game items or status, you must make a thread in the donation section. All donation statuss will be given the instant the server is online, and players accounts will be pre-made to prevent sniping. We will ask for the player to give a username and temporary password in which they may change when logging in. 

Lastly, staff will never ask for your account information or passwords. There are logs for a reason, and in last case resorts, I can copy the character file of a player. Forum-wise, accounts can be disabled and contacted through Email.
With all of that said, and hopefully not missing anything, I like to wish everyone happy foruming! Again, any questions or concerns, feel free to private message me and I will respond asap
