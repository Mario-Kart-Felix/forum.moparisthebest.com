[anchor=intro][b][size=15pt]Introduction to tutorial[/size][/b][/anchor]

Hello and welcome to my first tutorial on Simba scripting. If you are a beginner, then this tutorial is written by a beginner for beginners. This will teach you the basics of Simba scripting. Otherwise, this will just be a rewrite of the [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,162967.0.html]All in one beginner tutorial[/url] on SCAR. I will try to explain the simple codes to the best of my ability.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the latest version of Simba installed. The download links are provided below. Enjoy!

[anchor=ch1][b][size=11pt]Introduction to Simba[/size][/b][/anchor]
Simba is a free, open-source replacement for the venerable SCAR, it has reached a point where it is actually better than SCAR ever was and runs on multiple platforms (currently Linux and Windows, with Mac OSX soon to follow).[sup][size=6pt]1[/size][/sup] Simba can (but is not limited to) move your mouse, press keys and search for colours on your screen.[sup][size=6pt]2[/size][/sup]

You can download the latest version of Simba for all supported operating systems [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/downloads/simba/current/]here[/url] or from the [url=http://wizzup.org/simba/article/2]official site[/url].

[anchor=ch2][b][size=11pt]Basics of Simba[/size][/b][/anchor]
Thanks to the extensibility of Simba, it supports both plugins in machine code as well as extensions written in the Pascal programming language.[sup][size=6pt]3[/size][/sup]

The Simba program has been divided into 4 different components: the function list, library search bar, debug box, text editor.

The function list contains built-in Simba functions which you can easily choose from respective categories. When you write procedures or functions into your script, their names will also be included in the function list.

The library search bar allows you to type names (or parts therefore) of procedures or functions you want to find. It will narrow down the function list to what you searched for.

The debug box is an announcement-box as well as your console. When you compile, the debug box will print that you compiled your script. Running scripts will print out lines in the console as well.

The text editor is where you edit your script.

[anchor=ch3][b][size=11pt]Writing your first script[/size][/b][/anchor]
This may or may not be your first time scripting in Simba because you might have had prior experience with SCAR scripting. Nonetheless, let&#39;s begin!

This is the default script you will see:
[font=courier][b]program[/b] new[b];[/b]
[b]begin[/b]
[b]end.[/b][/font]

The first line will be your script name. The last two lines (begin..end.) form what you call your main loop. Without anything in it, your script will not do anything. You can&#39;t have spaces in the script name or you will be returned with this error:
[font=courier][Error] (2:13): Semicolon (&#39;;&#39;) expected at line 1[/font]

Now let&#39;s rename your script name to HelloWorld, make a new procedure called &#39;Main&#39; and include it into your main loop before running it!
[font=courier][b]program[/b] HelloWorld[b];[/b]

[b]procedure[/b] Main[b];[/b]
[b]begin[/b]
   Writeln(&#39;Hello World!&#39;);
[b]end;[/b]

[b]begin[/b]
   Main[b];
end.[/b][/font]

The output of the program would be:
[font=courier]Hello World![/font]

Congratulations, you just made your first basic script!

[anchor=ch4][b][size=11pt]Procedures and functions[/size][/b][/anchor]
Procedures and functions are similar to an extent. They also have differences between them. In the above script you would have noticed that I included a procedure. A procedure means a section of the script that can be called upon for many different reasons.[sup][size=6pt]4[/size][/sup] A function is a procedure with a return type.

This is a procedure:
[font=courier][b]procedure[/b] Writeln(s: [b]String[/b])[b];[/b][/font]

This is a function:
[font=courier][b]function[/b] StrToInt(s: [b]String[/b])[b]:[/b] Integer[b];[/b][/font]

After the parentheses of a function is the return type of the function. In this case, the return type is an Integer.

[anchor=ch5][b][size=11pt]Variables and constants[/size][/b][/anchor]
Variables and constants can be in the form of a few types.

A constant is a term with an assigned value which remains the same at the execution time. You can declare them at the the beginning of your script for easier reference. They are declared like this:
[font=courier][b]const[/b]
  MAIN_STRING = &#39;Hello World!&#39;[b];[/b]
  MAIN_INT = 1[b];[/b][/font]

However, variables are (as its name suggests) terms that can be changed or varied. You can declare variables globally or locally like in any other programming language.

Global variables are declared at the beginning of your script like this:
[font=courier][b]var[/b]
  str[b]:[/b] String[b];[/b]
  int[b]:[/b] Integer[b];[/b]
[/font]

Local variables are declared in procedures/functions like this:
[font=courier][b]var[/b]
  str[b]:[/b] String[b];[/b]
  int[b]:[/b] Integer[b];[/b][/font]

Note that local variables of a procedure/function cannot be accessed in other procedures/functions.

[anchor=ch6][b][size=11pt]Scripting standards[/size][/b][/anchor]
Scripting standards are rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program. It is often claimed that following a particular programming style will help programmers to read and understand source code conforming to the style, and help to avoid introducing errors. We can apply this[sup][size=6pt]5[/size][/sup] to scripting too!

I suggest getting used to these standards. The faster you get used to it, the better!

[ul][li]Indentation: when you indent, do so with two spaces or a &#39;tab&#39; - this makes the script easier to read. [/li]
[li]Line limit: when you write a line in your script, try not to exceed 80 characters or the margin you see in the text editor component.[/li]
[li]Begin and end statements: they appear on their own lines and should align together![/li]
[li]One statement per line: do not combine two statements into a line; write each on its own.[/li]
[li]Naming conventions: constants are named LIKE_THIS but variables are named LikeThis - try to name procedures/functions/program names/variables/constants very descriptively.[/li]
[li]Naming: when you name something, name it precisely! Naming a procedure EatCookies is better than DoSomething![/li][/ul]

              <p>Okay im just starting out yet again programming… started with tapes + stuff long time back zx spectrum and c16 lol(poormans commodore64…anyways… this list has some issues… for instance the program ive downloaded is 64 bit version is that why im getting different results and compile errors when im trying to follow the tutorial ?<br>
best spot to learn this stuff at all ?<br>
looks like a stunner tool  i need to control mouse and open bitmap checking inside a program to create a facial motion cap control pluggin for a freeware motion cap system thats out already.<br>
I have rough ideas how ill do it but this program maybe a better choice as then i can share this system with every 3d editing program not just 3ds max.</p>

end.</span>[/font]</p>
<p>The output of the program would be:<br>

[font=courier]<span class="bbcode-b">function</span> StrToInt(s: <span class="bbcode-b">String</span>)<span class="bbcode-b">:</span> Integer<span class="bbcode-b">;</span>[/font]</p>
<p>After the parentheses of a function is the return type of the function. In this case, the return type is an Integer.</p>
<p>[anchor=ch5]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=11pt]Variables and constants[/size]</span>[/anchor]<br>
Variables and constants can be in the form of a few types.</p>
<p>A constant is a term with an assigned value which remains the same at the execution time. You can declare them at the the beginning of your script for easier reference. They are declared like this:<br>
[font=courier]<span class="bbcode-b">const</span><br>
MAIN_STRING = ‘Hello World!’<span class="bbcode-b">;</span><br>
MAIN_INT = 1<span class="bbcode-b">;</span>[/font]</p>
<p>However, variables are (as its name suggests) terms that can be changed or varied. You can declare variables globally or locally like in any other programming language.</p>
<p>Global variables are declared at the beginning of your script like this:<br>
[font=courier]<span class="bbcode-b">var</span><br>
str<span class="bbcode-b">:</span> String<span class="bbcode-b">;</span><br>
int<span class="bbcode-b">:</span> Integer<span class="bbcode-b">;</span><br>
[/font]</p>
<p>Local variables are declared in procedures/functions like this:<br>
[font=courier]<span class="bbcode-b">var</span><br>
str<span class="bbcode-b">:</span> String<span class="bbcode-b">;</span><br>
int<span class="bbcode-b">:</span> Integer<span class="bbcode-b">;</span>[/font]</p>
<p>Note that local variables of a procedure/function cannot be accessed in other procedures/functions.</p>
<p>[anchor=ch6]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=11pt]Scripting standards[/size]</span>[/anchor]<br>
Scripting standards are rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program. It is often claimed that following a particular programming style will help programmers to read and understand source code conforming to the style, and help to avoid introducing errors. We can apply this[sup][size=6pt]5[/size][/sup] to scripting too!</p>
<p>I suggest getting used to these standards. The faster you get used to it, the better!</p>
<p>[ul][li]Indentation: when you indent, do so with two spaces or a ‘tab’ - this makes the script easier to read. [/li]<br>
[li]Line limit: when you write a line in your script, try not to exceed 80 characters or the margin you see in the text editor component.[/li]<br>
[li]Begin and end statements: they appear on their own lines and should align together![/li]<br>
[li]One statement per line: do not combine two statements into a line; write each on its own.[/li]<br>
[li]Naming conventions: constants are named LIKE_THIS but variables are named LikeThis - try to name procedures/functions/program names/variables/constants very descriptively.[/li]<br>
[li]Naming: when you name something, name it precisely! Naming a procedure EatCookies is better than DoSomething![/li][/ul]</p>
