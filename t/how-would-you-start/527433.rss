              <ol>
<li>Buy a domain with real hosting for a webhost</li>
<li>Make an actually nice website/forums, prevent bots from entering</li>
<li>Before you publicly release literally do all skills etc extensively. This way you need to keep a “log” that all players can view to show that you as the owner have already took actions to find most bugs and are currently in the process of fixing them</li>
<li>Start the server up after most of the bugs have been fixed and ask them to find ALL bugs you have missed no matter how big/small.</li>
<li>Keep the bug log on forums/whatever updated at all times</li>
<li>communication is KEY literally. Your players need to see that you ARE updating that you ARE fixing the bugs. That is how the server respect is earned!</li>
<li>Develop new content. Try to keep content as frequent as possible but not too frequent cause that makes it look like it’s shabby work.</li>
<li>Another point is to always remember to keep yourself happy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes*</p>
<p>I didn’t want to include this in the main section here but this is VERY important.</p>
<p>The economy … if you let too many items get flooded at once you WILL fail!. Have money sinks, have item sinks, take items out of the stores, discontinue them, bring NEW items in temporarily. KEEP GAMBLING OUT. Make strict rules for the server about gambling/sharing, multi logging, muling, giving away items once a person quits, and etc.</p>
<p>Remember, they depend on YOU to design and keep the economy stable. They can provide suggestions yes, and I encourage them to provide suggestions. But it is YOU that must understand how an economy works and what is good/bad for it.</p>

              <p>Honestly, the only thing I would do to start off is the same thing I’ve done for all my servers. I just pay for the domain name, accept donations, and allow the donations to pay for everything else. Host everything on your own, you can easily transfer everything.</p>

<h1>Ranting Below</h1>
<p>Go look at the toplist servers. Thoughts that come to mind: Beyond awful. Horrid. Gross. Disgusting. Why do people play these? The competition is slim, what they have on people starting servers is that they are committed and good at advertising their piles of shit.</p>
<p>If you create something that connects with your intended audience, you will be successful. 2006scape did it, you can do it too. Not implying that was a well crafted server, but hell they did generate a lot of hype and created a unique experience.</p>
<p>Anyone can start a server. Anyone can add minimal features to make it above average. How successful your server will be also depends on your technology. You need a good balance of advertising, and unique content created by your technology.</p>
<p>Examples of technology are plugin systems, embedded web servers, dialogue systems, quest systems, etc</p>
