    <title>*NEW* Lost Dynasty Project - Old School</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-lost-dynasty-project-old-school/395468</link>
    <description>Well due to high volumes of people who want to see a server like this return, I jumped right on-board and decided to make the server! Now there are several things I want to keep when working on this server.


[ul][li]1. Keep object training with less XP however. (I am going to add a high score system)[/li]
[li]2. Keep the client small, I want people to access it without having to download a 50mb client.[/li]
[li]3. Prevent all possible dupes now, and prevent new ones to come.[/li]
[li]4. Make it simple, yet hard to create some kind of challenge with the server.[/li][/ul]



Now, I understand servers like this need some kind of face lift so I will specify what I am doing to make this server have features from now a days, but keep the simplicity of the older days.

I will include NPC combat giving the same XP rate as the objects, however they will drop items you can sell for cash and other things.

I will include a PK Point system that can buy specific things (not anything great but something to make you coming back).

I will continue to update the server weekly to keep it alive.

I have already added an Anti-Mass system that will prevent lag server-wide because some idiot is spamming objects.

I&#39;ve lowered the XP given so that I can add high-scores, because I have added some skills for skillers to train.

Current skills available: Smithing, Mining, Cooking, Fishing, and Woodcutting.

Anything else you want to see from the old server added to this server? Post here!

Media (Will update with more media as it comes available):

THE SERVER IS NOW BEING HOSTED ON VPS, YOU CAN FIND LINK ON SERVER STATUS OR PM ME FOR LINK,

Will keep this updated will updates added to the server.</description>

<p>Na, we’re actually doing a Hyperion, but making it like phonescape. Though without the annoying bugs.</p>

              <p>Well due to high volumes of people who want to see a server like this return, I jumped right on-board and decided to make the server! Now there are several things I want to keep when working on this server.</p>
<p>[ul][li]1. Keep object training with less XP however. (I am going to add a high score system)[/li]<br>
[li]2. Keep the client small, I want people to access it without having to download a 50mb client.[/li]<br>
[li]3. Prevent all possible dupes now, and prevent new ones to come.[/li]<br>
[li]4. Make it simple, yet hard to create some kind of challenge with the server.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Now, I understand servers like this need some kind of face lift so I will specify what I am doing to make this server have features from now a days, but keep the simplicity of the older days.</p>
<p>I will include NPC combat giving the same XP rate as the objects, however they will drop items you can sell for cash and other things.</p>
<p>I will include a PK Point system that can buy specific things (not anything great but something to make you coming back).</p>
<p>I will continue to update the server weekly to keep it alive.</p>
<p>I have already added an Anti-Mass system that will prevent lag server-wide because some idiot is spamming objects.</p>
<p>I’ve lowered the XP given so that I can add high-scores, because I have added some skills for skillers to train.</p>
<p>Current skills available: Smithing, Mining, Cooking, Fishing, and Woodcutting.</p>
<p>Anything else you want to see from the old server added to this server? Post here!</p>
<p>Media (Will update with more media as it comes available):</p>

<p>THE SERVER IS NOW BEING HOSTED ON VPS, YOU CAN FIND LINK ON SERVER STATUS OR PM ME FOR LINK,</p>
<p>Will keep this updated will updates added to the server.</p>
