    <title>317 book help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-book-help/357238</link>
    <description>i have  made a book its all fine and it works well but i have two problems, the close window button doesn&#39;t work, and i was wondering if the book could load up on log in, as soon as you log in it opens
here is my code for the close window button: [code=qbasic]case 10162: //Close Window Button
                        c.RemoveAllWindows();
                        c.page = 2;
                        c.outStream.createFrame(1);
                        c.updateRequired = true;//updates current player status
                        c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
                break;[/code]</description>
