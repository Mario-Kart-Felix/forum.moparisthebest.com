    <description>Is this a good appeal?
_______________________________________________________
Hey, Jagex.

I used to play runescape for 40 years straight, I never even went pee or poo or ate. And I never could seem to get past tutorial island, when you updated tutorial island, I got past it and realized that this was my life, I played for another 40 years and got to level 4 cb, then a cat flew across my refrigerator and retrieved a carrot, and that&#39;s where it all started. I joined a botting agency and bought 1000 paid bots. I spent all my money on it and they got me banned, could you please help me sue them? If you don&#39;t unban my account I wil rape mod mmg over and over again until he tells me where the cat took my carrot. It doesn&#39;t matter if I botted because I smell and noone likes me at school I wanted to poo and carrots but it never worked out with Jarrod.
As you can see I am clearly innocent and I would like my account unbanned asap.

Regards, (Username).</description>
