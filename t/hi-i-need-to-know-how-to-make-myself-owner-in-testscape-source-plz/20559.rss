</aside>
<p>yes commands r easy kk… heres what you do::</p>
<p>search in your client.java for a command you already have in your server ex::saveme or ::pimp then after the last } press enter and add a code like this.</p>
<p>else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(“command goes here”) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 2)<br>
{<br>
addItem(idem number goes here, 1);<br>
addItem(, 1);<br>
addItem(, 1);<br>
addItem(, 1);<br>
addItem(, 1);<br>
addItem(, 1);<br>
addItem(, 1);<br>
addItem(, 1);<br>
addItem(, 1);<br>
sendMessage(“You have been PIMPED OUT! Mutha Fux0r!”);<br>
}</p>
<p>hope it helps (++)</p>
