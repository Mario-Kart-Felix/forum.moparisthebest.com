              <p>What it is saying is obviously the object id and the positioning of the object… You have to add it into your Mining and ActionHandler classes if you use cases for your mining. For the woodcutting, go try cutting a magic log in RuneScape with 99 woodcutting. It isn’t nearly a minute, but it’s over 30 seconds for 1 log. Anyways, you’ll have to search through your Woodcutting class.</p>
