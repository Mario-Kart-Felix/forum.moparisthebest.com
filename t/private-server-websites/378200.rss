    <title>Private server websites</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/private-server-websites/378200</link>
    <description>Well my exams have finished, and I will now have quite some free time and I&#39;m going to use some of this time to create website templates for Runescape private servers, mainly because this is one of the forums I visit the most and I want to brush up on my designing.

What I am looking for is what you as a player of a private server or someone who runs servers, what would you expect to see on a private server website (content or layout wise). Anything that contributes to this topic would be grateful, just a few words to a few paragraphs would be appreciated.</description>

It integrates a gameserver, highscores, forums and content management in one.</p>
<p>I believe what cane wants to do is design a HTML/CSS and possible JS (jQuery) driven template that people can build their own website backends to.</p>
<p>Edit: cane, a not too wide layout as the website won’t be packed with articles like a blog. I think it should have a news image slider at the top for latest news. I liked the little transparent black box on the Runescape website header that indicated number of players currently online and the account you are logged into. For colors, I think gold, brown, grey and yellow for Runescape private servers. I think noisy and stone textured backgrounds also suit it well.</p>
