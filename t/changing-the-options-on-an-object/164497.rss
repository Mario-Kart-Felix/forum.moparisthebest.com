    <description>options isnt really the word i was looking for but i couldnt think of the right one, anyway in my server (i updated to a newer client) the home portals used to go straight to home as normal but now when i want to go home using a home porta i teleport to pest control, but i can still use the ::home command to tele properly back to home, i want to see where the tele coords are on the object so i can change them where would i find these?</description>
