    <title>Back for the first time in many months need a heads up on cheating</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/back-for-the-first-time-in-many-months-need-a-heads-up-on-cheating/2632</link>
    <description>I quit cheating after the mass ban althought my main didnt get axed. I didnt wanna risk em and the cheat community busted into a million pieces anyways. Decided to look and see how a few were doing and saw that mopar had made one. Knowing how good his stuff is and that his proxy .bat file saved my main from the mass ban I decided to take a look.

Amazingly this cheat community is alive! Can someone update me on the cheating and how safe aryan is etc. whether or not you get flagged right away and wherther there are anymore cheats available. I know about srl and thas about it.</description>
