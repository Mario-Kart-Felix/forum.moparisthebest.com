    <title>Dwarf Remains Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dwarf-remains-issues/466262</link>
    <description>Yea, im guessing its an anti-dupe or some shit from what i read off rune-server, but I dont bother posting for help there cause people there retarded sometimes.

So my issue is that when I equip something, then remove it, and equip it again, i get dwarf remains in my inventory in it&#39;s place. If someone can link me a fix, or post a fix, that would be awesome. I have to fix this asap.

Im not really familiar with the layout of PI because I still do things old school and i just recently moved to 474 (i think). i dont really like the newer graphics and such. bad for PC performance if ur trying to multi-task. So if someone would please help, that&#39;d be awesome. I give u invisible repz.</description>

</aside>
<p>yeah same here ive only seen them as nulls</p>
<p>maybe try searching for your wearitem method and poke around there a bit and see where it adds the remains…</p>
