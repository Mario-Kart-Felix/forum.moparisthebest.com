    <title>Need Help... Again</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-again/456636</link>
    <description>Seems every time I try to mess around with private servers I always have the same issues on start up. With my new laptop I have been unable to run certain clients/servers and no compiler has worked. Currently my values are:


[ul][li]Classpath:C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin
[/li]
[li]Path:C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_20\bin[/li][/ul]



Can anyone send me their values and maybe a compiler or run.bat? I&#39;ve tried NUMEROUS different ones already and non have worked. I am operating on windows 7. 

And please no dick responses I&#39;ll admit now without hesitation that I&#39;m a narble supreme who knows very little if any at all about coding but would like to learn, thank you.</description>

              <p>Why would this work for you? Do you even know what that code is?</p>
<p>Read it bro - go to the disk drive C:/Program Files</p>
<p>Is your computer an x86, if not remove it.</p>
<p>Go to the java folder under C:/Program Files; you should see a file that says “jdk1.X.X_X”</p>
<p>Just replace what that jdk folder is called with the ones you have up there and it should be fine.</p>
