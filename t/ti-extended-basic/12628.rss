    <title>TI Extended BASIC?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ti-extended-basic/12628</link>
    <description>Hi, i have recently came across a Texas Instruments Compact Computer 40.
Though it was released 10 years before i was born, i would like to learn its modified TI Extended BASIC.
I was wondering if anyone had any tuts/codes for this that they would be willing to share.
Thanks,
Justis</description>
