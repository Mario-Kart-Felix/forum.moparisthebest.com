    <title>Computer had fatal disk error had to replace harddrive, so I&#39;ve got a question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-had-fatal-disk-error-had-to-replace-harddrive-so-ive-got-a-question/347751</link>
    <description>Alright well as aforementioned, my computer has been wiped clean. So, it looks like I&#39;m starting a new project.

And I&#39;ve come here to ask what to do.

What deob? 317, 474, 508, etc.

What base? (I would like one that is clean with no features if possible)</description>

              <p>Use the word “deob” correctly. Obfuscation is making code hard to read to stop people from fucking with it. Deobfuscation is the opposite.</p>

              <p>[quote=“rain1994, post:2, topic:347751”]Deob i don’t know what it means… srry a 317 is what most people use as a source but more and more people are moving to a 508 wich is the “newer version of rs” 47s is right in between them, has skill capes,emotes, and gwd.</p>
<p>Now i take it your are new to coding? you might not want to start with a “base” you will probably want to start out with a source that already has features that you can just edit and what not.</p>
<p>But here is the link to a “base”(clean no features) <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,441338.msg3241863.html#msg3241863" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,441338.msg3241863.html#msg3241863</a></p>
<p>Good luck[/quote]</p>
<p>No, I’m not that new, been doing this for a year or so.</p>
<p>And that base didn’t work for me. Like literally didn’t work.</p>
