              <p>The forum link on this thread needs to be fixed. And the first thing I noticed from the forums (while still assuming these forums were just put together) is that the basics of the forum haven’t been done such as renaming the community name (where it shows what the site name is in the tab area of the browser, yours states Invision Power Board), your crowns need to be redone as they’re not the right pixels to be aligned with the usergroup name (can be seen clearly on the moderation team page), and the colors used for the groups compared to what crowns are used are ridiculous.</p>
<p>Other than that, I can see the section and boards of the forum are basic but work with a starting community - nice job. I really don’t have feedback on the server as I’m not really a server kind of person but nonetheless, I wish the best of luck. You could also work with finding a new, unique theme or making one.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Found this server yesterday and I instantly fell in love. With it’s many unique features other servers do not have, It also gives the nostalgic feeling of 2007 era. The staff are impressively generous with their knowledge and are extremely easy to get along with. Like all other servers it does have it’s downsides, but what do you expect from a newer server? (Even though it has its downsides, it’s coded extremely well with barely any bugs) I would definitely recommend this server to anyone who loves the old styled Rs or anyone who enjoys a good 'ol time!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
