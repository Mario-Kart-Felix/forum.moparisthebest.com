    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anti-dupe-code-how-would-this-work-plus-another-question/359621</link>
    <description>on my server, i made it so you start off with 50m, and some starter items, but the thing is, i want to make it so you have to wait at least 20 minutes before your first trade or getting killed in the wild, any thoughts of how to do it? also i want to make an npc id unattackable , when you click on an npc on my server, it doesnt wait for you to come to it, it comes to you when you click on it, how can i make it non aggressive? (i know how to change the hp to 0)</description>
