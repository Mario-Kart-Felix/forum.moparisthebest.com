    <title>I need some database help before I create my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-some-database-help-before-i-create-my-server/357032</link>
    <description>Hello, I am about to buy my VPS and webhosting for my server. I noticed how some of the top servers have their SMF hooked up to a database of some sort so that users must register on the forums before being able to play ingame. If you could tell me how to do this I would appreciate it. Also, if I were to do this could I have my webhosting separate from my VPS or would I need to host the site on the VPS.


much appreciated,
