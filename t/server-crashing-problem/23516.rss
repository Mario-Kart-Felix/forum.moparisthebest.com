    <title>Server Crashing Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-crashing-problem/23516</link>
    <description>Hi,

I have had my server running for about a month and a half now and it has been going fine apart from one problem.

I have a pc dedicated to running my Project16 V.4.5 Server but after about 3-5 minutes of the server running nobody else can log in. I get no obvious errors in my run.bat and the people who are logged in can still carry on playing like normal. If these players log out they will not be able to log in again until the server restarts (i have set it to restart every 15 minutes automatically).

My players are also starting to notice it quite alot more now and i need to fix the problem.

If anyone else knows how to fix this i would be extremelly grateful if you could help.

I also have another problem.

The shops on my server were working fine and there has never been a problem. Now if i try to open a shop like varrock general store or anything i just get connection lost. This happens to everyone and i do not know why.

Thanks,

James</description>

              <p>Hmm i dunno about that one. U usin hamachi? cos if u are makin more than 1 network would let more peeps log on at the same time. I find that sometimes even if the hamachi network doesnt actually say its full, u still cant log in if there are too many peeps on the network.</p>
