    <description>[317 Coder Needed Still]

Hey, I am going to be making a server with my real life buddy and we would love to hire a great coder. As we do not know java we want to bring a opportunity to 1-2 persons to help code for our server. We currently do not have it up yet nor have a VPS yet I will be getting a good vps not a crappy one by next saturday. 

Basically we know that being a coder is hard work and time consuming so we are going to be fair with you and offer you a pretty decent pay PER UPDATE or fix of a bug/glitch/dupe. Also you get 1 10th of donations.

Coder is expected to...

Maintain the server, fixing bugs/glitches/dupes.
Getting input from players.
Doing multiple updates weekly. (You get paid per update you do)
1/10 of all donations you will receive $10 out of $100. Along with
your paid updates.

You will have a special rank given along with any rights you wish to
have. No trading on your main account, You can have 1 of each major
vote/pvp shop items on your secondary account.

Prices I pay (may be more or less but this is a average)

Fix a Bug/Glitch = $2-8
Fix a Dupe = $2-10
Edit Npc attacks/styles/drops/ETC. = $5.00 PER DAY.
Add a Minigame = $10-75.
Add Vote System (MUST BE GOOD!) = $25.00
Add a Dung Minigame = $10-75.
Add Nex FULL = $35.00
Contact me ONLY by email.... rohrer5a@yahoo.com After that I EXPECT you to have a better way on how to reach you ASAP always. Names Austin. Thanks!</description>
