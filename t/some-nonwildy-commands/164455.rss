[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 13, 2007, 12:31:00 AM[/size][hr]fully my check wildy looks like this</p>
<p><code>public boolean inwildy = false;
public void checkwildy()
{
if ((absY &lt;= 10112 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3970) || (absY &lt;= 3672))
{
inwildy = true;
}
else
{
inwildy = true;
}
}
public void checkwildy2()
{
if ((absY &lt;= 10112 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3970) || (absY &lt;= 3514))
{
nonWild = true;
}

              <p>[quote=“War Man, post:11, topic:164433”]I know how to make safe-zones. Here you go :</p>
<p>First, open up client.java and in it, search for :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean nonWild()</code></pre>
<p>You should see something like the following :</p>
<p><code>public boolean nonWild() {
    if((absX &gt;= 3091 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3100 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 3507 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 3513) ||</code></p>
<p>After the last “||” , hit enter and paste this :</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(absX &gt;= XXXX  &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= XXXX &amp;&amp; absY &gt;=YYYY  &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=YYYY )||</code></pre>
<p>The “XXXX” &amp; “YYYY” will be the places where you will put the co-ordinates of the place that you want to be made into a safe-zone.<br>
Say, for example, that you wanted to make EdgeVille Bank into a safe-zone. For that you would do the following :</p>
<p>Go, first of all, to EdgeVille Bank. What you must then do is find and go to the southern-western-most point of it. Once you are there, look at it’s co-ordinates and fill in the first “XXXX” and “YYYY” with those co-ordinates.</p>
<p>After that, find the co-ordinates of the northern-eastern-most point of it. Once you have found those co-ordinates, fill in the second “XXXX” and “YYYY” (in the code) with those co-ordinates.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to find the co-ordinates of a certain place, go to that place and click on your “emotes” tab. Look at where your “run energy” is supposed to be and you’ll find that co-ordinates of where you are standing over there. If that doesn’t work, in your server, go to the place of which you want the co-ordinates. When there, type ::mypos or ::coords and hit enter. You’ll receive the co-ordinates in your chat-box, so just use them in the code.</p>
<p>With all of the above done, save and close your client.java and compile your server. Then run it, and your all done.<br>
Thanks, I hope I was of help.<br>
And yeah, a thanks would be appreciated ;).[/quote]<br>
Just Follow This.</p>
