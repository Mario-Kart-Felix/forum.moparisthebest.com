    <title>Player Name containing something</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-name-containing-something/144813</link>
    <description>I typed this up:
[code]if (playerName.startsWith(&quot;Mod&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 0) {
sendMessage(&quot;Banned. Come back without mod in your name,&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;Or get unbanned and modded, then log back in.&quot;);
disconnected = true;
appendToBanned(playerName);
}[/code]

But that only prevents them from having mod at the beginning of their name. I can and will make it for having mod in your name, But how would I prevent them from having a name like &#39;I Mod You&#39; - containing the word mod?</description>
