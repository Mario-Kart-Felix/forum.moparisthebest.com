              <p>I had a similar problem, this may sound a little weird but i had my server set on an ip address, which was actually my own ip address, and then the next day it allowed connections through a totally different ip, and my original,  try connecting through your local host, and some servers tell you in the batch file what the ip is that your connecting to your server. Just look in there once your logged in to your server, and then change your ip your connecting too, to that, and it may or may not work, it all depends.</p>
