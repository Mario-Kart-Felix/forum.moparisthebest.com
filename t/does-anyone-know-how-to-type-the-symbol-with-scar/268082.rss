              <p>That is because the ‘@’ character is actually on the 2 key (As I know you do already know but this helps explaining) which means when you use getKeyCode it returns the 2 key.</p>
<p>So just like you would normally to get the @ character, you must also have shift pressed down for it to appear as ‘@’.</p>
<p><code>KeyDown(VK_SHIFT);
KeyDown(GetKeyCode('@'));
KeyUp(GetKeyCode('@'));
KeyUp(VK_SHIFT);
</code></p>
<p>Just don’t forget to put small wait times inbetween down and up to make it look more human like if your doing on a game your not suppose to macro on</p>
