    <title>Changing the appearance of your character?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-appearance-of-your-character/5276</link>
    <description>I started my server, and my brother and I have been playing for a while now, but i&#39;ve noticed that every new character i create looks exactly the same. 

Same hair, same shirt, pants etc. Is there a smidgen of code anyone could give me to change this? I thought i found it once, when it said [code]
		//Setting player standard look
		playerLook[0] = 3;
		playerLook[1] = 6;
		playerLook[2] = 7;
		playerLook[3] = 8;
		playerLook[4] = 4;
		playerLook[5] = 1;

		/*playerLook[0] = 1;
		playerLook[1] = 5;
		playerLook[2] = 5;
		playerLook[3] = 6;
		playerLook[4] = 5;
		playerLook[5] = 10;*/

		//Giving the player an unique look
		playerEquipment[playerHat]=Item.randomHat();
		playerEquipment[playerCape]=Item.randomCape();
		playerEquipment[playerAmulet]=Item.randomAmulet();
		playerEquipment[playerChest]=Item.randomBody();
		playerEquipment[playerShield]=Item.randomShield();
		playerEquipment[playerLegs]=Item.randomLegs();
		playerEquipment[playerHands]=Item.randomGloves();
		playerEquipment[playerFeet]=Item.randomBoots();
		playerEquipment[playerRing]=Item.randomRing();
		playerEquipment[playerArrows]=Item.randomArrows();
		playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=1275;[/code]
..In Player.java, but i couldn&#39;t work out how decipher the numbers. 

Any help would be groovy. 
Thanks</description>
