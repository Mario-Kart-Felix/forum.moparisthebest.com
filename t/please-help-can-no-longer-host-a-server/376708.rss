    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-can-no-longer-host-a-server/376708</link>
    <description>this is the 2nd time ive posted this casue no replys.
hey everyone first off ima start with this: i have a belkin g + mimo router and a bellsouth.net modem

ive portfowarded on the router useing the virtual servers tool
portfowarded port 6161 on TCP and UDP, same thing on the modem,

now since 2 weeks ago i can no longer host on the same port and server and client

server:
i checked server.java and server.ini
i made sure that they were on port 6161 so i compiled and ran wiht utorrent overtopping.

i went to canyouseeme.org port check tool and typed in the port.

every time its ether connection refused or timeout.
i shut down all my firewalls
router, computer and modem
and still same thing.

i made sure on client that the client.java server spot was linked. it had the gui.server in it. so it linked over to gui.java
i went in there and changed the ip.
still nothing.
(in client i made sure i changed 43594 to 6161)

so does anyone have any help on why i can no longer host a server?
