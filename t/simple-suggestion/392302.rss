    <title>Simple Suggestion</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-suggestion/392302</link>
    <description>Just a simple suggestion to the forums. It&#39;s more than likely been suggested before, but I&#39;ll just suggest it again.

This is more for the Help Section, but adding possibly a button when the original poster has their question answered, that basically suffixes the topic title with [SOLVED] and locks it. It would also prevent gravedigging (purposeful or otherwise).

Now I know some technical challenges that may surface by adding this. Such as adding the feature only to a few boards, and then the responsibility of the OP to mark it as solved. Most people would probably just say &quot;ok thx bai&quot; and leave it as that.

Just a suggestion.

              <p>Just a simple suggestion to the forums. It’s more than likely been suggested before, but I’ll just suggest it again.</p>
<p>This is more for the Help Section, but adding possibly a button when the original poster has their question answered, that basically suffixes the topic title with [SOLVED] and locks it. It would also prevent gravedigging (purposeful or otherwise).</p>
<p>Now I know some technical challenges that may surface by adding this. Such as adding the feature only to a few boards, and then the responsibility of the OP to mark it as solved. Most people would probably just say “ok thx bai” and leave it as that.</p>
<p>Just a suggestion.</p>
