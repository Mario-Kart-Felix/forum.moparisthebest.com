<p>If it does, how?[/quote]Think about it. Global warming increases the amount of liquid water in the hydrosphere. With increases of water, comes increases of weather. It doesn’t all just stay liquid. It condensates and precipitates too.</p>

</aside>
<p>You want proof, go and find it. I have already found proof. Google it and find a source you trust. You are clueless if you think that global warming is absolutely because of mankind. You can’t comprehend obviously that you just so happen to be born in an era where the natural weather cycle of the Earth is due for change anyway. We are due for a new ice age about now, we are due for a killer asteroid about now. Is it our fault that the Earth would be hit by a killer asteroid if it did? Just because on average they happen every now and then, and one is already overdue? Society is peril. Go live in a cave.<br>
[/quote]You are the clear definition of an idiot. There is more than enough proof that global warming is caused by man. Want to know why, apparently your sources didn’t tell you why. The pollution that comes out of cars, factories, powerplants, etc all carry “Green house gases” and another poisonous molecule called carcinogens. Carcinogens also have an effect of causing cancer in the human body too, as well as they reflect back up, which in turn gets trapped in our higher atmosphere by the green house gases.</p>
<p>A lot of other idiots that would be siding with you right now would be saying its part of an 11 year sun cycle where the poles of the sun flip, blah blah blah. First of all, yet its true that the sun does has a cycle that consists of 11 years where 5.5 years into the cycle the sun is at its hottest temperature, but that wouldn’t effect us if we had the green house effect going on in our atmosphere. We always had the effect going, which is what caused the last ice ages to end.</p>
<p>Please don’t bring half assed examples to your argument if you can’t even argue the outcome of it. There is no “Earth is overdue for an asteroid” or “Earth is overdue for another ice age.” All in turn, it depends mostly on whats going on outside of our atmosphere that will determine when the next ice age will come (unless its a super volcano eruption).</p>

<p>who said the sun’s 11 year cycle had anything to do with this? that is to do specifically with the sun’s solar flares due to the magnetic field. this does have some effect on the weather on earth but the earth has natural cycles, ice ages to tropical weathers worldwide. all we are seeing is the beginnings of a new ice age, not global warming due to cars and industrial activity. they are insignificant. you obviously read the newspapers for your scientific resources. you are not stupid but you are ignorant.</p>

<p>Lmao. Do you pay your green taxes like a good little boy then? Do you sort your aluminium cans from your crisp packets? The Earth is changing naturally. It has been proven that we have had little to no impact since the 90s. Don’t just assert what I know just because you have little to no clue.</p>

<p>Okay. Where’s your proof that it doesn’t exist?<br>
[/quote]<br>
You want proof, go and find it. I have already found proof. Google it and find a source you trust. You are clueless if you think that global warming is absolutely because of mankind. You can’t comprehend obviously that you just so happen to be born in an era where the natural weather cycle of the Earth is due for change anyway. We are due for a new ice age about now, we are due for a killer asteroid about now. Is it our fault that the Earth would be hit by a killer asteroid if it did? Just because on average they happen every now and then, and one is already overdue? Society is peril. Go live in a cave.[/quote]You are the clear definition of an idiot. There is more than enough proof that global warming is caused by man. Want to know why, apparently your sources didn’t tell you why. The pollution that comes out of cars, factories, powerplants, etc all carry “Green house gases” and another poisonous molecule called carcinogens. Carcinogens also have an effect of causing cancer in the human body too, as well as they reflect back up, which in turn gets trapped in our higher atmosphere by the green house gases.</p>
<p>A lot of other idiots that would be siding with you right now would be saying its part of an 11 year sun cycle where the poles of the sun flip, blah blah blah. First of all, yet its true that the sun does has a cycle that consists of 11 years where 5.5 years into the cycle the sun is at its hottest temperature, but that wouldn’t effect us if we had the green house effect going on in our atmosphere. We always had the effect going, which is what caused the last ice ages to end.</p>
<p>Please don’t bring half assed examples to your argument if you can’t even argue the outcome of it. There is no “Earth is overdue for an asteroid” or “Earth is overdue for another ice age.” All in turn, it depends mostly on whats going on outside of our atmosphere that will determine when the next ice age will come (unless its a super volcano eruption).</p>
<p>just shut up.</p>
<p>kthx</p>
