    <title>[508] Major Server Development!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-major-server-development/401247</link>
    <description>Hello, and welcome to the development team of ServerSoft, 508. I am currently looking for new recruiting members to add to this development team division. Members who have been recruited to the division will recieve these exclusive benefits:

1. Access to the Server GUI (Graphical User Interface) which can Ban, IP-Ban, Mute, IP-Mute, Kick, Jail, IP-Jail, Promote, Demote, Teleport, and can even add items to the players account. With this GUI, you pretty much have the rights of the server owner.

2. Depending upon the position you have been drafted to, you will most likley have a Gold Administrative Crown by your Username in times of Chat.

3. You will have access to our Exclusive Server Software, which can not be found anywhere else on the internet!

4. You will also recieve IN-Game Benefits, such as Special Commands, Free Membership for as long as your a staff-member, and even special Staff-Only areas.


So why join us? Because! With are many advanced updates, we will attract a wide-range of players. By doing this, our server will be massivley popular. We also have content on our server that NO other server has, and because of this, our server is in-definitley unique.


So, put your:

1. Age:

2. Name:

3. Position:

4. Experience:

5. How you would Benefit the players:</description>
