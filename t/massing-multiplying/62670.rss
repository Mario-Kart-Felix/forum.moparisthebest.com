    <title>Massing multiplying?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/massing-multiplying/62670</link>
    <description>Ok, this is not good.  I was minding my own bussiness, when i noticed shops in the wrong place, and nulls everywhere.  Then, i noticed that there were 14 people online, then all of a sudden 40 people!! I was like what in the hell. I looked on the list, and half of them were nulls.  The next second, there were 60 players online.  It lagged my computer and my server so bad i shut it down.  Whats the problem?</description>

              <p>for the shops, ppl attacked em with magic and made em move around. for the nulls, i think there is an anti null tut somewhere in the tutorial section</p>
