    <description>Hey everyone! I&#39;ve been working on this server for about 2 days now and im pretty sure ill be starting to host with it. I like the source and i added some shit to the client so hopefully i can get some other coders and developers involved in this project. Atm the server is called EtherealPK() It will be an Eco/Pvp/Pvm server and we wont be adding in dclaws but we will have some custom. (Ex. D-kite, D-cape, and some custom whips) Currently the Dueling arena is shut down because of glitches and stuff like that. It works but i just dont know yet if im going to be allowing the dueling arena. Now what im looking for are (Coders and Website developers) possibly 2 of each. But i will take all the help i can get. Now ill tell you a bit about me. Im 18yoM, I go to college 2 days a week(Studying to be an EMT/Firefighter), I have a gf so she will get some of my time(I wont be online 24/7), i live in texas, i have been coding Runescape private servers for about 2 years off and on(I can add shit in but i can really create my own codes and shit). Thats about it.

Add my skype if you&#39;re interested and ill talk to you about it.
