    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/restoration-rsps-need-co-that-knows-java/453916</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I started this project a while ago never really got into it. I&#39;m looking for a co owner that&#39;s american and knows java coding. I got a real nice source and client just looking for a person thats willing to do this project with me. I also have a website (its a free domain but it works). Everything is set just a few minor fixes and we&#39;re ready for launch. Really Really want this to happen.

~~~~information about the server~~~~
-667-718 source/client

-Flawless no errors

-Want to change a few things in the source will go in to this later with established co.


~~~Co-owner information~~~

-Must be American/live in America, does not matter what timezone.

-Know how to code java. (not a basic understanding)

-preferably ages 15-20 (I&#39;m 16)

Please note the reason I prefer you to be american is because everything will be easier. No I&#39;m not racist

If you are wanting co - please add my skype &#39;angelofdeathrs1&#39; please state that you&#39;re wanting co when you add me.</description>
