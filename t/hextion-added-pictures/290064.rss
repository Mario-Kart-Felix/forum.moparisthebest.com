    <description>[center][b]Welcome to RspSoft[/b][/center]

[b]Myself[/b]
Yet another development, but no worries, I have a few of them still running but only work on them when I get bored, or if I&#39;m not playing pkr poker.

I&#39;ve been developing this server for about 2 weeks now, it&#39;s coming a long very well and I have cleaned + modified it completely.


[b]Server base:[/b] Deltascape

[b]Release date:[/b] 2 - 3 Weeks  for official release
                            [b]1 - 2 for Alpha and BETA testing.[/b]

[b]Information:[/b] The server base was deltascape, by now it is more like shard or even rs2dv, I have added my own thread per client that needs a few modifications and the server its self is totally cleaned.
I was not able to use the EventManager but I am working my way around using the same feature but in a different way hopefully better (Highly doubt).

[b]Features added:[/b]
The current features added are highly coded and use a lot of conventions you do not see on other servers, as stated before the server has been cleaned and modified to my specifications.

Here&#39;s a list of what I have done so far;


[ul][li]Added Barrows my way, this includes the tunnel and chest.[/li]

[li]Fixed up Pest Control a little, I&#39;m currently adding the NPC&#39;s to be spawned through the portal.[/li]

[li]After watching NPC eating that someone else created. I have added a little script to modify later on in the development.[/li]

[li]Added my mini god wars but will be deleting soon, too many glitches on the map.[/li]

[li]Added my very own thread per client, unfortunately not handled.[/li]

[li]Added 16 quests that work 100% yeah some are leeched because I couldn&#39;t think of them :P[/li]

[li]Cannon works a little, working on the animations and rotation now coming along very well.[/li]

[li]Dragon claws 4 times hitting special attack, didn&#39;t really want to do this to my client nor server but  :eek: well.[/li]

[li]Fixed the fence glitches in the client, cache modification is marvellous. [/li]

[li]Other things are just to basic e.g building the economy.[/li][/ul]



[b]Additional Information[/b]

[i]What are we trying to achieve?[/i]
We are working on being one of the all time best private servers, the private server is already popular and on a 20GB RAM VPS we are sure that we will hit one of the best servers out there. One of our biggest concern is the development team, we would like the team to stay small but are active and to work hard on daily tasks that are given out, this way we can achieve a lot more with a small team rather than a big team. 
We are also trying to get the server more stable, this way we can make sure the server will be online 24/7 without a worry of the crash. I know there are a few bugs in the Thread per client that is added, I will get around to them and hopefully they will be fixed very soon.

[i]Are there any bugs your aware of?[/i]
Yes, every private server will have a bug/glitch, we are going to work around them and in the Alpha testing stage we will be sure to pick up on more of them. Hopefully we will get permission from a staff member at [b]Moparscape.org/smf[/b] to let us start a small development team, this way we will start hiring Alpha testers and [b]BETA[/b] Testers.

[b]The current team.[/b]
The current team only consists of one member, me the project leader. So far the task has proven to be very difficult for me but hopefully there will be a extra help in hand shortly. Although I have used a few tutorials to work around difficult parts I have modified to me specifications, hens the conventions that are used within the private server class files.

We are looking for someone who has experience in MySQL, as of now we are not accepting in till we get permission from a staff member.

              <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Welcome to RspSoft</span>[/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Myself</span><br>
Yet another development, but no worries, I have a few of them still running but only work on them when I get bored, or if I’m not playing pkr poker.</p>
<p>I’ve been developing this server for about 2 weeks now, it’s coming a long very well and I have cleaned + modified it completely.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Server base:</span> Deltascape</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Release date:</span> 2 - 3 Weeks  for official release<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">1 - 2 for Alpha and BETA testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Information:</span> The server base was deltascape, by now it is more like shard or even rs2dv, I have added my own thread per client that needs a few modifications and the server its self is totally cleaned.<br>
I was not able to use the EventManager but I am working my way around using the same feature but in a different way hopefully better (Highly doubt).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Features added:</span><br>
The current features added are highly coded and use a lot of conventions you do not see on other servers, as stated before the server has been cleaned and modified to my specifications.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of what I have done so far;</p>
<p>[ul][li]Added Barrows my way, this includes the tunnel and chest.[/li]</p>
<p>[li]Fixed up Pest Control a little, I’m currently adding the NPC’s to be spawned through the portal.[/li]</p>
<p>[li]After watching NPC eating that someone else created. I have added a little script to modify later on in the development.[/li]</p>
<p>[li]Added my mini god wars but will be deleting soon, too many glitches on the map.[/li]</p>
<p>[li]Added my very own thread per client, unfortunately not handled.[/li]</p>
<p>[li]Added 16 quests that work 100% yeah some are leeched because I couldn’t think of them :P[/li]</p>
<p>[li]Cannon works a little, working on the animations and rotation now coming along very well.[/li]</p>
<p>[li]Dragon claws 4 times hitting special attack, didn’t really want to do this to my client nor server but  :eek: well.[/li]</p>
<p>[li]Fixed the fence glitches in the client, cache modification is marvellous. [/li]</p>
<p>[li]Other things are just to basic e.g building the economy.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Additional Information</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">What are we trying to achieve?</span><br>
We are working on being one of the all time best private servers, the private server is already popular and on a 20GB RAM VPS we are sure that we will hit one of the best servers out there. One of our biggest concern is the development team, we would like the team to stay small but are active and to work hard on daily tasks that are given out, this way we can achieve a lot more with a small team rather than a big team.<br>
We are also trying to get the server more stable, this way we can make sure the server will be online 24/7 without a worry of the crash. I know there are a few bugs in the Thread per client that is added, I will get around to them and hopefully they will be fixed very soon.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Are there any bugs your aware of?</span><br>
Yes, every private server will have a bug/glitch, we are going to work around them and in the Alpha testing stage we will be sure to pick up on more of them. Hopefully we will get permission from a staff member at <span class="bbcode-b"><a href="http://Moparscape.org/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org/smf</a></span> to let us start a small development team, this way we will start hiring Alpha testers and <span class="bbcode-b">BETA</span> Testers.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">The current team.</span><br>
The current team only consists of one member, me the project leader. So far the task has proven to be very difficult for me but hopefully there will be a extra help in hand shortly. Although I have used a few tutorials to work around difficult parts I have modified to me specifications, hens the conventions that are used within the private server class files.</p>
<p>We are looking for someone who has experience in MySQL, as of now we are not accepting in till we get permission from a staff member.</p>
