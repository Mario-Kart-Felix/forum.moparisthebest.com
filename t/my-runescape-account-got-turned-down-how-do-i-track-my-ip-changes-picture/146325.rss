    <description>Hi all, 
      I forgot the password for my runescape account, I said they can check the starting IP, for the account, when I went on the track a account, this is what they sent me:

They want to no all of my IP changes, does anyone no anything that tracks all my IP changes, and how I can be 100% sure of when I made that account.

Because if I get all information right, I can have the account back.

Many Thanks

<p>Were you using Tiscally Broadband, TalkTalk Or whatever. Just answer truthfully, (Or good Lies) and you will get your account back.</p>
