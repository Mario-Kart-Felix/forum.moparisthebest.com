    <description>Hi guys, I used to be able to make webclients but now my luck has just gone downhill ,

I was hoping someone could maybe make me a webclient for my new server?

I&#39;m using insidiaX&#39;s source and client and I would be most appreciated if someone could contact me by pm so we can talk??

Thanks guys.
