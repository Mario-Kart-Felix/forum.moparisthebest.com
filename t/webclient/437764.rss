    <title>Webclient...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient/437764</link>
    <description>Alright, I followed THIS tut, because it was recommended to me by looking at the &#39;Client Help page&#39; http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,535370.0.html

But I have PI client, and I do not have the &#39;string url =&#39; or stingurl = which ever floats your boat. So how would I make a webclient out of a client, that doesn&#39;t have that? And it doesn&#39;t have the &#39;CacheDownloader.java&#39; either. Or whatever you have for yours. 

And it&#39;s not a Delta, because I already looked that up to make sure.

Any suggestions?</description>
