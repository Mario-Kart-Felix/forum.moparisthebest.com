    <description>I was following this guide: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,336494.0.html

And the first step.. it says search findcachedir() in signlink.java.. I did.. and its nothing similar to what it says its supposed to look like.. it doesn&#39;t say (s1 = /.cache/) or whatever.. it just says like return; /.cache/.. i tried changing that to what it said in the guide but then I just get compiler errors.. any help please? anyone know a different guide? I&#39;m using exion client (PI based)</description>
