    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient/356994</link>
    <description>Hey guys, im making a server and need a web-client for my server. I want to be able to embed it to my website and whatnot. And every-time i try to follow a tutorial, i screw up on making one. If someone would help me make it, i will gladly give them a 1 month membership card to rune scape (the real game).</description>
