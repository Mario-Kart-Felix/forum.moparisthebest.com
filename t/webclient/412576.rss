    <description>COuld someone please help me with this webclient. I&#39;ve been trying to build it for a bit now, but it always ends up failed. I currently do not have the jar signing, but i&#39;m not worried about that at the moment. I&#39;m trying to get it so the cache will just download to the C:\ for now, but it doesn&#39;t want to work. So if someone could please help me, that would be lovely. :)</description>
