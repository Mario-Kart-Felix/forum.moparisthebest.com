    <description>I was wondering if there was anyone on here that could make me a webclient AND put it on my vBulletin forums. You can do it over teamviewer if you&#39;d like. I can&#39;t pay, since my paypal is messed up, but if you keep me added on msn or something, I can contact you when I&#39;m able to play.

Contact me on msn or post here to do it. travisjyates@hotmail.com</description>
