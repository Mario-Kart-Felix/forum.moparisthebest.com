has the code for webclient all you need is to jar and sign your client then put it in your dropbox<br>
public folder copy the public link then put it in to your webclient code it should look like this</p>
<p>archive =“client.jar”</p>
<p>replace that with your new jarred file.</p>
<p>If you need help with that just pm me im pro coder</p>
