    <description>Hey guys!
Just wondering how to make a webclient via HTML?
I tried and tried but I&#39;ve just failed :&#39;(
I&#39;ve tried many tutorials and I can&#39;t find anymore so I&#39;m posting this.
Also when you guys say you need to get your cache and client.jar hosted do you mean by uploading it to like fileden or something like that?

I repeat, I have tried many tutorials and things to succeed but I just can&#39;t get it right.

Thank you so much guys for helping I really appreciate it because I have 300 members on my site waiting for the Webclient to come online and onto the site.
