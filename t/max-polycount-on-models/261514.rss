    <title>Max polycount on models</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/max-polycount-on-models/261514</link>
    <description>Info for the more &#39;switched on&#39; people.

There isn&#39;t a limit to the polycount on models as such, what there is is a buffer length, and when you exceed it, an exception is thrown.

class42_sub1 -&gt; aByteArray1359 = new byte[65000]; 

which means that the maximum dat size for models, must not exceed 65,000 bytes.

A simple model with no skins, priorities, alpha or textures has about 7,500 triangle limit (uncompreseed model).
By adding, skins priorities, alpha and textures, you effectively reduce this number to about 2,500 triangles.(uncompressed model).

You could change the buffer size, but you might limit the platforms the game will run on.

Hope that info helps.

P.S. mods - don&#39;t go moving this to the models section, they won&#39;t understand it anyway.</description>
