    <description>hey.
i have started to edit cfg of my items in my 127.0.0 server thing.
first thing i did was change whips str bonus from 82 to 300.
then i changed yellow phat so it would have +200to everything.
but then i logged on and found it didnt change a thing.
ive redone it a million times, saved it, even tryed changing other items.
 its juts NOT working...

some one help me.

thx seeya[br][size=1]Posted on: April 21, 2007, 06:15:56 PM[/size][hr]hey me again.
i cant seem to get on to dodian, its saying to many connections from ur address.
when i really only just opened and got no other connections....
i tryed restarting my computer, turning off my internet and reconecting.
it wont work...
after a while i left the server and went to enkrona.
i went back after half an hour and it said invalid user name and password.
so i make up a new account like im a new player,
so i log in and get to around lvl 50, then it laags and logs me out.
i try and log back in and it sais my account is already logged in...
i try my other account and it says to many connections from your address...
some one help me please</description>
