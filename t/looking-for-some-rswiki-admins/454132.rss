    <title>Looking for some RSWiki admins</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-some-rswiki-admins/454132</link>
    <description>Title says it all, I am looking for some admins so they can help when the wiki gets spammed with viagra ads. Please note, you have to have been here awhile/have a decent reputation in order to be accepted.

[size=18pt][b]edit:[/b][/size]
in case anyone is wondering what this entails: you have to log in every week or so and ban abusers/spammers and revert/delete their changes.

[size=18pt][b]edit2:[/b][/size]
[quote=&quot;t4&quot;]i should have mentioned this earlier, but if you all would be so kind to reply with the following:

* Are you able to check the wiki at least once a week, perhaps even two weeks?
* Why do you want to help?
* What is your timezone[/quote]

[quote=&quot;t4&quot;]Hey all, I&#39;ve picked the admins for the wiki... we ended up with 5. If you didn&#39;t get picked, I am sorry. There was quite a lot of talented, trustworthy people who posted in this thread. If an admin has to step down in the future, I&#39;ll keep your enthusiasm you displayed in this thread in mind.

Congratulations to:
[b]Scape-JAVA[/b]
[b]m.dog311[/b]
[b]Chassy13[/b]
[b]Native^[/b]
[b]Jmood[/b]

Here is a guide to what your job basically entails:

Everyone who was selected, please post your wiki username in this thread so I can elevate your status to administrator. Please take the time to make sure your password and email are secure; failure to secure your account will lead to a revoked status.[/quote]</description>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">* Why do you want to help?</span> - The RS WIKI isn’t a highly known resource right now and I’d like to let it grow in popularity, and this obviously requires that it has safety and doesn’t get messed with. I feel like I’ve drifted away from being involved in this community after I resigned (apart from Project Notebook), and would like to step in again for something.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">* Why do you want to help?</span> - Its a contribution to the community and I have plenty of time to spare and help. I feel its a learning curve because I have administrated other types of websites and servers as in another rsps community, a few of my own successful servers. Not to mention I have assembled my own websites. But never have I done anything with a wiki do I feel by letting me be a part of this, I will gain more knowledge in administrating websites and other communities.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">* What is your timezone?</span> - Idk what the GMT is but I’m mountain zone so yea. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I think that’s GMT -7</p>
