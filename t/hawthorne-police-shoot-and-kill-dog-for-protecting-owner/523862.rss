Hey moron. The dog didn’t “deserve” to get shot, all three of the cops “deserve” to get fired. Arresting someone for talking out is just not right, especially from a cop who is meant to set an example for kids, not shoot their childhood best friend.</p>

              <p>How about taking the verbal abuse and letting the owner go so no one gets hurt. The dog wouldn’t have attempted to attack with his owner around, if they were pulling the owner away then the dog might attack but right there and then, no the dog looked a bit playful. Might I point out that if the dog was going to attack they would have known, it would have ran full blast without stopping.</p>
