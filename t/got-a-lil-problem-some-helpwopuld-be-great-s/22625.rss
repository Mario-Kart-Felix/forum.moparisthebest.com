<p>I use SCAR A LOT for ATITD, a game that allows cheating as long as you don’t afk. The current auto program(it has some for linux, mac osx as well), is ACtool, different to SCAR, doesn’t have DTMS or BMPS, it has objects, there like BMPS but A LOT slower. Since I only know a few things for it, I’m not sure if it can use objects to detect an admin chat tab, but my point goes on.</p>
<p>It’s currently in Tale 3, has been running for almost 4 years(Tale 3, 4 months) but in Tale 1 the rule was enforced a lot. Right now you just get collared if your odiously autoing, it’s easy to detect since a lot of scripts that use ACtool couldn’t care less if it looks like your autoing or not, I however use scar, I can make it look like autoing, I use click + movemouse a lot of the time but can remain human. The way admins check to see if your autoing afk is to chat you. (You can disable chats from other people). My uber anti-admin is to use say findbitmap and play a sound, pause the script and wait until you press a key. It might not work since admins may teleport to you and say it in the Main tab, but then you can make some bullshit excuse say your making glass on 2-3 glaziers benches and it’s very consuming of the mouse and needed to ignore them.</p>
<p>But yeah, besides that SCAR CAN and IS used on other games apart from RunEscape. You don’t need SRL for RunEscape, can just use say SRL anti-randoms with Squig and make your own.</p>
