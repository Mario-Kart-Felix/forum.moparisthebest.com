    <title>Exp change on RSCD not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exp-change-on-rscd-not-working/238528</link>
    <description>Hey people.

I tried to change the ip on RSCD source,
but it&#39;s not working.
I have changed it in player.java and in formulae.java
But nothing happens.. 
Does someone know what to change more? maybe id of the people.. normally they are 3.

I hope i get answer soon!

Thankyou</description>
