    <description>I am working on my first server and I have an idea so ill tell you it and please post feedback of what you think. (good or bad)

Idea:

When you woodcut money will come out of trees so I was thinking to make the server fun and enjoyable I would make shops that sold all the items but make them fairly expensive so that you will want to chop and save up money for your favourite items. The reason I thought to do this was because I hate playing servers where you can get to the max level fast and everyone has all the best items, so making little but a fair amount of cash come out of the tree and pricing shop items high, I think this would make servers alot less boring because there is always another item to save up for. :)
Just an idea I think ill stick with it but what do you guys/girls think?</description>
