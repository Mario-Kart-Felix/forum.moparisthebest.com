    <title>[PI] Auto saving problems :S</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-auto-saving-problems-s/401145</link>
    <description>I am having some problems with the auto saving it doesn&#39;t auto save at all.
I have tried changing the config folder but this doesn&#39;t change anything.
If the server crashes this will cause a very big roll back and that would be extremely irritating. 
Please can anyone help me? :)
It would be much appreciated. 
Thanks.</description>
