    <title>New project not related to rs. Need gfx!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-project-not-related-to-rs-need-gfx/552008</link>
    <description>Hello Guys and Gals of mopar there is another game I play called evony.
It has tons of players.
They open new servers every few months where anyone can go if they want a fresh start.
Hundreds of ppl go to each new server and spend a minimum of 30$.
Theres a few players that even drop 1000$.
But everyones mad(well I guess more like dis-appointed) at the devs.
Why? well simply becuz all the devs care about is money.
There are no new updates.
But the game is soo fudgeing addictive too many players.
But like i just said there are no new updates.
Plus you wont get banned for anything. Not jackshit!
Years ago you would basically get banned just for saying the word bot,
now its not even monitored and u can say &quot;yeah im botting&quot;
&quot;heres my script if you want it&quot;
&quot;and a link to the site where i got the bot from&quot;
Saying these things will not get you banned.
Nothing will happen, Nothing at all.

So where do I come in?
I want to make a game like evony.
Me and a one of my other mates of gonna give this a try.
We are looking for more devs if anyone is intrested.
I will be updating this thread as we develop this project.

To get to the game site just google evony it will be the first one.

EDIT:Need a gfx!!!!!!!!

I hope you have experience in Adobe Flash, Evony is entirely made up of it.</p>
<p>Also: Because the game is in Flash… You could use swf decoders to try and rip their “Client” (It’s actually one .SWF that loads up a series of others…), then reverse engineer it, similar to how RSPS did it.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Yeah but I would like to make an actual client instead of people playing <span class="mention">@via</span> browser[/quote]<br>
Then you’re going to have to write the game in a different language entirely.</p>

              <p>Hello Guys and Gals of mopar there is another game I play called evony.<br>
It has tons of players.<br>
They open new servers every few months where anyone can go if they want a fresh start.<br>
Hundreds of ppl go to each new server and spend a minimum of 30$.<br>
Theres a few players that even drop 1000$.<br>
But everyones mad(well I guess more like dis-appointed) at the devs.<br>
Why? well simply becuz all the devs care about is money.<br>
There are no new updates.<br>
But the game is soo fudgeing addictive too many players.<br>
But like i just said there are no new updates.<br>
Plus you wont get banned for anything. Not jackshit!<br>
Years ago you would basically get banned just for saying the word bot,<br>
now its not even monitored and u can say “yeah im botting”<br>
“heres my script if you want it”<br>
“and a link to the site where i got the bot from”<br>
Saying these things will not get you banned.<br>
Nothing will happen, Nothing at all.</p>
<p>So where do I come in?<br>
I want to make a game like evony.<br>
Me and a one of my other mates of gonna give this a try.<br>
We are looking for more devs if anyone is intrested.<br>
I will be updating this thread as we develop this project.</p>
<p>To get to the game site just google evony it will be the first one.</p>
<p>EDIT:Need a gfx!!!</p>
<p>Updates:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">6/14/15</span><br>
Created tons of integers for the players items count number and few other things.<br>
Created strings for the house information lvl 1-25, created intergers for the time to level up the building and, for the amount of resources it cost.<br>
Created strings for the hotel information lvl 1-25, created intergers for the time to level up the building and, for the amount of resources it cost.<br>
Created strings for the house information lvl 1-25, created intergers for the time to level up the building and, for the amount of resources it cost.<br>
Started on a way to save the players information.(Have errors I need to fix and not 100% done)<br>
Created strings for info and intergers for attack, defense, speed, traintime, and capacity for laborers, longswords, scims, scouts, and vikings.<br>
