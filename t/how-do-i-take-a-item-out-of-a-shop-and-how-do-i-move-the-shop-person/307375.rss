<p>First you need to go into your <span class="bbcode-b">server files</span> and look for a folder called <span class="bbcode-b">config</span>. Open the folder and you should see around 10-15 files. Look until you find a file called <span class="bbcode-b">shops.cfg</span>. Open it and you should see a lot of numbers. Now you need to know the shop you are looking for. Such as, if you want to edit the items in a shop called “herblore shop”, you need to search for <span class="bbcode-b">herblore_shop</span>. Now you need to know what item to remove. If it is a regular <span class="bbcode-b">jagex item</span>, try using <a href="http://google.com/?action=itemlist" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">this</span></a>. If it is a custom item, open up the <span class="bbcode-b">client files</span>, and look for a file called <span class="bbcode-b">class8.java</span>. Open it, and search for the <span class="bbcode-b">item name</span>. You should see something such as (i == ####). The number is the <span class="bbcode-b">item id</span>. Now go back into the <span class="bbcode-b">shops.cfg</span> and look for that id under the specified <span class="bbcode-b">shop name</span>. Remove the <span class="bbcode-b">item id</span> and the numbers right <span class="bbcode-b">after it</span>, as they are the amount of item.</p>
<p>Now, to change the location of the npc, you are going to want to go back to your <span class="bbcode-b">server files</span>. Open up the folder called <span class="bbcode-b">conffg</span>. Look for <span class="bbcode-b">autospawn.cfg</span> Search for the <span class="bbcode-b">npc id</span>. If you are not sure of the id, go <a href="http://google.com/?action=npclist" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"><span class="bbcode-b">here</span></a>. There will be some number after the npc id, such as:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = ####	3077	3506</code></pre>
<p>Now the #### is the <span class="bbcode-b">npc id</span>, and the 3077 is the <span class="bbcode-b">x-coordinate</span>, while the 3506 is the <span class="bbcode-b">y-coordinate</span>. Change those to the desired position in game.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. =][br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 09, 2009, 06:41:14 pm[/size][hr][quote author=lolipwn link=topic=403538.msg2988033#msg2988033 date=1255135045]<br>

Open your <span class="bbcode-b">server files</span> and look for a file called <span class="bbcode-b">client.java</span>. Open it and press <span class="bbcode-b">ctrl</span>+<span class="bbcode-b">f</span> and search for “ddspeced”, change all occurrences to “Elemental-Isle”. Also, open a file called <span class="bbcode-b">texthandler.java</span> and do the same.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you this is exactly what I was looking for If i was able to rep you I would</p>
