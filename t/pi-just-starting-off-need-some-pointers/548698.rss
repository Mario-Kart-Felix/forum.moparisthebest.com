    <title>[PI] Just starting off, need some pointers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-just-starting-off-need-some-pointers/548698</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;m just getting into RuneScape private servers, I wish to run one with my buddy for my runescape friends. 

I&#39;m wondering, how some servers run PI 317, and look like they are 718s. It&#39;s hard to understand. I do not know the correct terminology, I&#39;ve searched all over before posting this thread. Please point me in the correct direction. So I can make my PI 317 look like a 718.

Thank you  :)</description>

              <p>Hello, there. If you are just starting out with RSPS this can be the least of your worries, if you want a couple pointers I’d recommend firstly downloading a source/client you like from:</p>

<p>Once you get familiar with changing things around &amp; start to understand what certain pieces of code do. Then you should look into this. Most of the servers have items added by the owner, who might have even updated maps/interfaces. You will find plenty tutorials for this if you just search in google! You’ll notice google will be your best friend to start with! All the best &amp; good luck</p>
