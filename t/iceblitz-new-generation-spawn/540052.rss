    <description>[center][b]I Used to have a project named &quot;Iceblitz SPAWN&quot;, So I guess this is gonna be the 2nd version.
First of all, I need someone who knows how to develop websites so if you are good at adding a good looking forums + homepage,
then I guess you are qualified to work with me on the website. I am also looking for a great developer who is interested in teaming up with me.
The base is PI, but has had alot of work put into. The codes are very clean and the server can handle 300 + players (netty added). [/b]

[B]Some nice features:
Summoning is almost 100% added (working wolpertinger for the hybrid pkers)
Re-done combat system
Re-added models
Pk point system + shop
PvP armours added correctly (Deg.able)
Chaotics added perfectly (breakable)
Full screen client added (almost 100%)
Main reason why I created this thread is for developers or just smart coders who
are interested in teaming up with me for the server.[/B]

[b]Are you a great java developer ? And you want to join my team ?
Pm me your skype![/b]

[CENTER][B]Investing Budget for first month of release: $300[/B][/CENTER]
Means, That I am planning to let my partners (Jiglojay,Kasoy &amp; other famous YTers)
upload my promotional when the server is ready for release)
