              <p>Q1: If you use his router / computer, yes. Otherwise, no.</p>
<p>Q2: By portforwarding than just running the server, connecting to the computer with the running source on it.</p>
<p>Q3: He should already have an IP by looking <a href="http://whatismyip.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>
<p>Q4: He could connect with no IP(not no-ip), or 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>Q5: He should have a static IP already.</p>

<p>A:  As long as he has the source files being run by the JVM on his machine, yes.<br>
A: Assuming you answered yes to the above, the same as though you were hosting on your computer, except on his.<br>
A: No, however this is <span class="bbcode-i">highly</span> recommended because if he doesn’t whenever his IP changes (can be quite frequently) you will have to update the client with a new IP and recompile and have all users redownload it. Needless to say that’s a huge hassle and I can’t see why he wouldn’t want to set-up a static IP.<br>
A: It can be your server while he is hosting it, yes. However, if you mean you have the  server running on your computer, but it’s set to use his IP information, no this is not possible.<br>
A: Go to his IP4/IP6 settings and tell the computer to use a specific IP address. There are numerous guides online on how to do this.</p>
<p>To answer your questions, you can be the owner of the server while he has the source files and he is running it from his computer. However, if you mean you have the server being ran on your computer, but configured to his information, no this will not work. I didn’t completely understand your question and if I didn’t answer your questions, that’s why.</p>
