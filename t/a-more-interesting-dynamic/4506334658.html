I don’t agree with these changes to be honest. We’ve discussed and debated the effects of PvP on a server and in the end most people felt more comfortable with it off.</p>
<p>We aim to be a large community-based server who are close to eachother and who feel comfortable living near eachother, and PvP would destroy that confidence as it has done in the past. I don’t really like the idea of ‘member justice’ as you’ll always get the members (I’m not saying it is you or your friends) that will group together and go after a member for breaking a block or two within their property.</p>
<p>As for citadel, I don’t really know what that plugin achieves since I’m on my phone and won’t be able to research it until later…<br>
[/quote]i’m losing a little bit of patience with people not understanding that my argument is not just turning PvP on and leaving the world at that, the whole point of the extra dynamic of imprisonment would hopefully throw the challenge of keeping people safe on a few people who are powerful enough to enforce justice. of course, these enforcers aren’t at all likely to pop up if everyone here hates each other but that’s another interesting part of the natural social dynamic, do you help someone because it’s morally right or do you not help them because they broke your sand generator?</p>
<p>it’s odd that you’d suggest the idea that i’d be scared of my neighbour purely because PvP has been enabled, why should i be scared of him? if he’s liable to going nuts then he’s going to feel the consequences of doing so through imprisonment, and once imprisoned he’s probably not going to do that again. the only reason one should ever also be scared of his neighbour is when they’re too young/dumb to understand that <span class="bbcode-i">PvP enabled /= PvP server</span>.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry I haven’t replied any sooner, I actually forgot about this discussion. I also find it interesting. I understand the concept of your idea, but I don’t particularly like the idea of the ‘prison system’. It seems that users with enough power and resources could set up some form of dictatorship (for lack of a better term). Also, is PvP not a fundamental part of your suggestion? That’s why I mentioned it.</p>
<p>How does this jail-pearl system work? I haven’t had time to read up on it, but I guess you could say that my lack of knowledge on it contributes to my disliking of it.</p>

<p>How does this jail-pearl system work? I haven’t had time to read up on it, but I guess you could say that my lack of knowledge on it contributes to my disliking of it.[/quote]of course, a crazy oligarchy of powerful nutters could imprison anyone and everyone they wish, but i like to think of the whole ‘test’ for the server with this system is to not devolve into such a thing. i guess it falls down to the extent at which the populace are willing to cohabit peacefully, and who’s willing to form a society to be peaceful (be it a monarchy or anarcho-capitalism with a consistent judiciary system)</p>
<p>PvP is a fairly fundamental cog in the system as it’s the selected medium through which one can enforce justice, but i dislike the dismissal of the concept based purely on that it allows PvP to happen; the fundamental difference between PvP being enabled and PvP + imprisonment is that consequences are much higher for disrupting order and thus the prospect of being imprisoned can keep most people from engaging in PvP, especially if you’re the aggressor. think of it like real life, you can go out and punch someone but you don’t because it’s wrong, both morally and socially. same concept here, feel free to kill but expect consequences (in this case they’re player-enforced consequences, rather than the current system where the consequences for griefing is an admin-issued ban).</p>

        <p>I don’t think something like citadel is a bad idea, but I’m not sure what it does exactly. Something like this would surely be helpful?</p>
<p>[ul][li]Any player can remove blocks which they placed[/li]<br>
[li]Removing someone else’s block takes more time, where this time is proportional to the time since the block was placed. So if it was placed 24 hours ago it would break at normal speed, and if it was placed a week ago it would take considerably longer[/li]<br>
[li]If the original block placer has not logged in for some time then their blocks can be made weaker. I think this is an ok tradeoff because without this their blocks wouldn’t have protection anyway and wont be reporting any damage during their inactivity.[/li]<br>
[li]This stops abuse (ie, placing blocks in peoples houses/cities) because they can be removed easily if done quickly[/li]<br>
[li]With the old res mod, people used to barricade themselves in impenetrable houses and made everyone a bit antisocial. With this, people can still gain entry - it just takes longer[/li]<br>
[li]Could also do something where a players “strength” increases the longer they play, and could also have friend lists so that people working together can edit each others stuff.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I’m sure this would have a massive impact on griefing, as the only players able to do any significant damage would be on the friends list of the person they’re griefing. And I’m not sure about any problems? It would be less vanilla, of course, but imo it’s more realistic that it’s difficult to break down someones house (and I’m not sure why we have to religiously keep the server vanilla, provided we’re not doing stupid shit).</p>

It would be less vanilla, of course, but imo it’s more realistic that it’s difficult to break down someones house (and I’m not sure why we have to religiously keep the server vanilla, provided we’re not doing stupid shit).[/quote]you’ve actually described some things similar to how citadel works, however the time based system is represented through resources used to reinforce (a player for a longer time will be able to afford to reinforce with iron or diamond whereas a newbie can only really use smoothstone). players can bypass their own reinforcements, but the system still needs to implement group reinforcement (it already has group privacy for chests/furnaces though). new 1-day griefers will practically be limited to reinforcement with stone only so it’s difficult for them to abuse the system unless they bide their time gathering before griefing as stone really isn’t much of a block protection, it’s mainly for TNT proofing a house.</p>
<p>edit: if anyone is interested in a server that uses the proposed systems, pm me (it’s great but premium-only).</p>
