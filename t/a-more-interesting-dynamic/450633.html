        <p>griefing as a completely allowable thing, PvP turned on, if anyone griefs my shit I hunt them down with my homies and we raid their shit. install something like <a href="https://github.com/Exultant/PrisonPearl" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">prison pearl</a> so i get to do whatever i want with them and the mods don’t have to waste their time banning idiots when i can have fun chasing them and taunting them when they’re stuck in the end. if griefing is too easy, install <a href="https://github.com/Exultant/Citadel" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">citadel</a> so they can’t grief my shit too quick. bitchez</p>
<p>edit: since that was a poor way of actually conveying my point, basically implementing player-based justice and letting the players deal with people so if they want to stop griefers they can act to stop them and get something out of it ie. equipment and bragging rights. it’s also a much more realistic system, and it could allow players to group up to fight the bad guys. whaddya think?</p>

        <p>So if I understand it right you mean you want to take the right in own hands? Well I think that will work for teaming up against the griefer but the damage won’t be repaired by that. I think the system that’s currently here (with the moderators) is good. The moderators take a look at it and ban the griefer if it’s needed and roll back the damage.</p>

        <p>[quote=“relmitos, post:2, topic:450633”]Theres plenty of servers like that.[/quote]there’s plenty of servers like this too? also, i think you’ve misread something considering there are very few servers that employ a system like this where consequences are dealt with by the players, there tends to be the absolutes between players enforcing justice without some form of imprisonment system or players not enforcing justice and leaving it to server authority. the majority of servers you may be referring to are the former, they don’t particularly work because the consequences are comparatively little (losing items vs. potentially indefinite imprisonment)</p>

        <p>We’ve already gone over most of these issues recently. PvP will stay off as it has been decided that in the end it does more harm than good. Yes PvP has it’s advantages, but it also has its disadvantages. Like the people who would pvp new players as soon as they could. As far as all those plugins go to help you “Take justice in your hands”. We have a moderating team that do a good job at helping to rollback damage and ban/mute people when needed. That is half of the reason why we have them. We are trying not to be dependent on plugins, because the more plugins you have, the more annoying it can be. Some plugins can interfere with the other plugins we have. Also, when Minecraft updates to the newest version, the reason in the past it has taken us so long to update is because of us waiting for both bukkit and our other plugins to update too. Now that Minecraft and Bukkit have joined together that wait should be gone. While we do have a few things that are not “Vanilla”, we are trying to keep as vanilla as possible with this server. Read around in the boards a little bit and you can find all that I have just said pretty much if you don’t believe me.</p>

<p>We’ve already gone over most of these issues recently. PvP will stay off as it has been decided that in the end it does more harm than good. Yes PvP has it’s advantages, but it also has its disadvantages. Like the people who would pvp new players as soon as they could. As far as all those plugins go to help you “Take justice in your hands”. We have a moderating team that do a good job at helping to rollback damage and ban/mute people when needed. That is half of the reason why we have them. We are trying not to be dependent on plugins, because the more plugins you have, the more annoying it can be. Some plugins can interfere with the other plugins we have. Also, when Minecraft updates to the newest version, the reason in the past it has taken us so long to update is because of us waiting for both bukkit and our other plugins to update too. Now that Minecraft and Bukkit have joined together that wait should be gone. While we do have a few things that are not “Vanilla”, we are trying to keep as vanilla as possible with this server. Read around in the boards a little bit and you can find all that I have just said pretty much if you don’t believe me.</p>

</aside>
<p>first of all, people PvPing newbies should warrant that a squad rolls out to kill that person as i would personally regard them as a griefer, disregarding exact semantics. that’s merely a crime solvable by the proposition of the imprisonment system (and a big player-decided punishment should be proposed for such people, i personally hate them)</p>
<p>keeping vanilla minecraft is an important virtue of any server for me, but i guess this falls down to the argument at how far from vanilla is “correct” to one’s own eyes, and i don’t personally recognise a server as being close to vanilla SMP if it focuses only on the constructive side of the ordeal, which may be sufficient for you but the game’s dynamics allowing for both construction and destruction makes me feel like i’m part of a world that contains good and bad, rather than just playing lego where i can hit sheep with a sword as an added bonus.</p>
<p>regarding the plugin dependency argument, it seems odd that you’d criticise my suggestion of plugins when you play a server that relies upon them anyway for delivering justice, limiting the world’s bounds and linking the server to a database. i have recognised that the citadel plugin would interfere with the chest-locking (LWC?) plugin, but one could easily disable either LWC (to fit in with the general gamemode the other plugins would mold, where it’s hard to crack a chest open but possible. make a vault of reinforced obsidian if that’s such a worry!) or disable the chest locking features of citadel.</p>
<p>[quote=“relmitos, post:8, topic:450633”]No I Meant servers where pvp is enabled and griefing is allowed. Theres plenty of servers like that, we’re just not one of them. I wouldn’t be playing if griefing was allowed.[/quote]yes, and that was exactly the ‘former’ i was referring to, those servers don’t particularly work due to douchebags just running around the server with the best armour killing everyone. my suggestions and the plugins that constitute it give griefing consequences, but only for as long as the player wants to enforce such consequences. it also makes griefing difficult, but provides material benefit for those that want to chase down those that went against the odds to grief something. if you’re successful, you’re effectively repaid by them losing their items and justice is done (and you can have fun with summoning the imprisoned and taunting them if you’re cruel). if it’s hard to raid their base, they’re imprisoned! why not extort its position out of them in return for them being ‘free’?</p>

        <p>The plugins that we have now we actually need and use to keep the player base up. These plugins you are suggesting just add on even more. <em>we’ve recently been denied a pugin for the end to have it reset the dragon without resetting the end, as well as having a plugin for spleef I’m pretty sure</em> That being said, they were denied because they were not crucial to the gameplay, and neither is the plugin you want.

<p>isn’t the whole “not knowing” argument just as contrasting with the current style of the server now? really, how can you ever assert that someone won’t be a menace for as long as they can gain some sort of ability to change the game world? extensive background checks aren’t possible, and any halfwitted griefer can just put on a smiley face and then promptly burn down your house, it’s an argument against giving non-trusted people any form of power in general.</p>
<p>the idea of perhaps adding these plugins eventually would that it adds another layer of collaboration between people, so you don’t just work together to build but you work together to enforce justice and eliminate those that want to get in the way of that, i don’t think you’re getting the message that the enabling PvP is only part of the game mechanic changes that i’ve proposed, i am fully aware that the community is functional without PvP now and only enabling PvP without the ability to enforce consequences for initiating force won’t work at all, which is exactly what the method of imprisonment i suggested aims to address. my idea is even nicely harmonious with the map limits since a griefer can’t just run off as far as they can go; there’s a limit on how far they can hide from you.</p>

<p>As for citadel, I don’t really know what that plugin achieves since I’m on my phone and won’t be able to research it until later…[/quote]i’m losing a little bit of patience with people not understanding that my argument is not just turning PvP on and leaving the world at that, the whole point of the extra dynamic of imprisonment would hopefully throw the challenge of keeping people safe on a few people who are powerful enough to enforce justice. of course, these enforcers aren’t at all likely to pop up if everyone here hates each other but that’s another interesting part of the natural social dynamic, do you help someone because it’s morally right or do you not help them because they broke your sand generator?</p>
<p>it’s odd that you’d suggest the idea that i’d be scared of my neighbour purely because PvP has been enabled, why should i be scared of him? if he’s liable to going nuts then he’s going to feel the consequences of doing so through imprisonment, and once imprisoned he’s probably not going to do that again. the only reason one should ever also be scared of his neighbour is when they’re too young/dumb to understand that <span class="bbcode-i">PvP enabled /= PvP server</span>.</p>
<p>also, isn’t this:</p>
<blockquote>I don't really like the idea of 'member justice' as you'll always get the members (I'm not saying it is you or your friends) that will group together and go after a member for breaking a block or two within their property.</blockquote>
exactly what shouldn't be be happening, given the member base, you'd expect them to have at least some sense of what's a good punishment for what assuming they aren't all 12 year olds that overreact when you break their flowers.

<p><span class="bbcode-b">edit</span>: also, i’m actually quite enjoying this discussion. disregarding the misunderstandings of certain elements of my proposed gamestyle, it’s actually interesting what you guys have to say considering you play an almost entirely different type of minecraft to what i do.</p>
