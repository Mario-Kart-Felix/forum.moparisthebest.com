    <title>Starting from Scratch - Topic #1</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-from-scratch-topic-1/490122</link>
    <description>Since I see a bunch of scrubs creating &#39;starting from scratch&#39; tutorials I&#39;m going to help people get an idea of what the requirements are to create your own source. I&#39;ll also go over websites that will help you get to where you want to be and cite personal experience of what I&#39;ve done in the past, where I messed up, and how you can avoid doing that.

This tutorial is not a &#39;oh look we can get messages from the client&#39; discussion. This is discussion aimed at making a successful source. I wrote this on the fly and I didn&#39;t plan much of it so the quality is bad. Sorry for not touching up on questions people may have or giving examples, I plan on doing that in the future.

There&#39;s so many topics to go over its hard to cover them in a single thread.

[b]PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO ALL THE SECTIONS OF THIS DISCUSSION[/b]

I took out time to write this because I would love to see an increase in the amount of sources being made on mopar.

[u]So, you want to create your own source?[/u]

Obviously if you are reading this you want to create your own source or you are maybe interested. Do you want to create a new base because you hate what is currently available to the public? Or possibly because you have time to burn and you want to start a new hobby? 

Most higher revisions don&#39;t have a server made for them, and therefore you often have to make your own server to be able to have a fancy-dancy new server that attracts a lot of nimwitted players who love modern graphics over the older crappy graphics.

I&#39;m going to do my best to make you NOT want to create a new base. Why? Because you will be wasting a huge chunk of your life if you try without being prepared. If you want to make your own [i]EFFECTIVE[/i] server base it will take months of planning and programming to do it by yourself and there are far more effective alternatives currently available that will stomp on your little piece of skeleton code in content and functionality.

So here are the cons:


[ul][li]Butt loves your time[/li]
[li]Takes a huge amount of skill[/li]
[li]Takes a huge amount of dedication[/li]
[li]Possibility of better alternatives than what you have made[/li][/ul]


Now, also to add you need to go into understanding the client you are using to connect to your server. Why? Well how the hell are you going to debug features effectively if you cannot comprehend how your client works? How are you going to add proper features into your server if do not know what those features are? 

To be an effective server developer, get some client hacking experience. The MITB wiki is your friend. If you are not a good client hacker prepare to spend more time becoming a better client hacker. Note, this is from experience.

[u]Oh, so you&#39;re still here...[/u]

So I haven&#39;t scared you off yet... Well alright, good, we still need pansies to develop crappy PI servers to keep the forums active. Now I&#39;m going to talk about the pros of creating your own base and why I personally love creating a server from scratch.

Creating a server from scratch is one of the hardest programming projects I ever take on. It&#39;s because you are essentially recreating a very large and very popular game. You obviously aren&#39;t Mark Gerhard or whatever the love his face is and you may not even be in college yet so you are kinda scrub with little or no actual programming experience. Me included. I&#39;ve just been around the block.

Practically if you can create a server from scratch there is no limit to what you can do in terms of functionality. Features should be very easy to add and you can maintenance your server very effectively instead of nervously watching it like a ticking time bomb. It will be your key to success if done correctly. It is essential that a server source have a few things: it has to be easy to fix, it has to be easy to add content, it has to have the major core functions. 

Here&#39;s a break down of each:

Easy to fix - Software breaks, you are wasting time if you cannot fix it effectively because your source is strung about like spaghetti and you want to bash your head on a wall because your modules are so dependent on one another that it&#39;s like trying to separate a group of starved men from eating a ice cream sundae. 

Easy to add content - So say, hypothetically, you have a few thousand players. And these players like updates, but lets say that because the server you&#39;re working on has very low level features it takes a lot of your time to create a very small update. A lot of those players are going to leave because they lose faith in your developing which loses you money plus on top of that you lose even more money from the time you wasted with awful bad content systems. It&#39;s just a mess.

Major Core Functions - I&#39;d say this one is the least important but is also a very fine detail. It ties into easy to add content as well. The most major core function missing from every god damn private server is updating. Why? Because back in the old school days no one understood how ondemand worked and just assumed it was some sort of another login type. We didn&#39;t get updating until like 614 and it was done so bad then that it was just an experiment on most sources. Most people just attach cache downloaders to their client which leads to a large amount of problems. I won&#39;t delve into that but that is one of my huge pet peeves. 

Here&#39;s a list of pros:


[ul][li]Easy customization[/li]
[li]Extensive features[/li] 
[li]Easy to maintenance[/li]
[li]Bragging rights[/li][/ul]


[u]Opinions of major sources[/u]

I&#39;m sure these opinions will resound with people and strengthens the reason why you may want to create your own base.


[ul][li]Delta/PI by horribly programmers - The worse of the worst. Absolutely a nightmare to work with, absolutely no scalability and expect your player base to stagnate with this unless you are prepared to be super inefficient by trying to make it better. Best for content however. And sadly this is why it is used.[/li]
[li]Runesource by Blakeman - Great stability. Poor amount of core features, content, and organization. Also usually morphs into shit because of its poor organization.[/li]
[li]Hyperion by Graham - I personally don&#39;t like the organization but its fantastic because it has a large amount of core features, great organization, and content. Because I think it is designed a little different than what starting out programmers are use to it is not used as much as it should be.[/li]
[li]Apollo by Graham - Great stability, great amount of core features, great organization. However like Runesource, lacks content and therefore is never used. The Ruby plugins are like a two edged sword, powerful yet since people don&#39;t comprehend Ruby they are scared to use it.[/li][/ul]


[u]Websites to help you out[/u]

If you are using a OOP language, and understand your language very well but need to get to that next level check out. It will definitely make you a higher level tier of programming if applied correctly. http://www.oodesign.com/

If you aren&#39;t very good at java I suggest you start reading up on javadocs and read up on &#39;maps&#39;, &#39;lists&#39;, &#39;queues&#39;, &#39;deques&#39;, &#39;linked&#39;-anything, &#39;stacks&#39;, &#39;jvm bytecode&#39;

If you aren&#39;t very good at client hacking I suggest you check out the informative threads section on R-S. It contains a lot of protocol information that I will go over in future threads. Threads by &#39;Method&#39; are the best for protocol information and help you get a handle on whats going on with the internals of the client and how the client and server communicate.
