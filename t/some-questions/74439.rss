    <title>Some Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-questions/74439</link>
    <description>I am setting up Animations for each of my Barrow&#39;s weapons so that people aren&#39;t tempted to mass-click, and I am wondering how I make it so that an Animation starts, and ends... then in like 5 seconds start again. Is there? Any help appreciated, thanks.

Q #2.) Okay, second question, i&#39;ve made something like this: [code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 4718 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerLegs] == 4722 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerChest] == 4720 &amp;&amp; playerEquipment[playerHat] == 4716)[/code] and I want to be able to make it so that if a player meets those requirements (wears full dharoks) their max hit goes up by 30 .... how can i do that?[br][size=1]Posted on: April 04, 2007, 09:20:33 AM[/size][hr]new Question... [br][size=1]Posted on: April 04, 2007, 10:22:02 AM[/size][hr]Will anybody please tell me how to do this????

Q #3.) Third question, is there a list of animations out there somewhere that lists and shows what all the animations do or how do I find them out?

Q #4.) Fourth Question, what do all the numbers in this mean (the first, second, and third)?[code]attackPlayersWithin(76, 4000, 100);[/code]
