1.well if i want to start up another server then i want to stream my characters from the first to the second. 
like: if i logs on server one with char 1 at Coords 1 1 and then i logs out and logs in again on server 2 with char 1 then i want it to have same items and be on same location etc. is this possilbe like is it any tutorials cuz ive been searching around and havent found anything.

2.is it possible to delete all the maps,items,npcs trough the cache?
if so, how?

3.is it possible to not hardcode items and npcs via class8 and class5?

              <p>With the first question (Sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, I’m really tired.).</p>
<p>Try to find the string where it tells the server to read the player data from and have both the sources read the source from the same directory… Um, like this.</p>
<p>[Folders]<br>
Source 1<br>
Source 2<br>
Players</p>
<p>Have a code in source one and two like, playerdata.equalsIgnoreCase("…\players");</p>
<p>or something <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> sorry if this was as no help to you… -yawn-</p>
