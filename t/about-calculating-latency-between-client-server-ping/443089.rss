    <title>About calculating latency between client &amp; server(ping)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-calculating-latency-between-client-server-ping/443089</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried to make client display the latency between server and client several times, but they all showed it way wrong.

What I tried was simply just sending the time when ping was sent to the client, and then calculate the difference between the ping sent and ping received on client. 

Any advice?</description>

[/quote]The problem with this being that it’s not as easy to get an accurate metric since you’re calculating it only once per ping. If you timestamp the packet and give it some identifier, you can potentially get a larger sample size.[/quote]<br>
Oh, i see.</p>

<p>I sent a packet to client and save time as ‘ping’, then the client sends packet right away back and then record the time as ‘pong’.</p>
