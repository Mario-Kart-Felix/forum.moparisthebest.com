I’m sorry, not to be rude, how do you have 53 rep? (I guess rep really doesn’t mean anything anymore.</p>

Example, if you want only co-owner and owner only use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (command.startsWith("lalla") &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt; 2)) {</code></pre>
<p>owner only:</p>

You’re giving him the client sided crowns, when he is asking for a way to change what player right each integer gives.</p>
