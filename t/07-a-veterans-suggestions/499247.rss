    <title>[07] A Veteran&#39;s Suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/07-a-veterans-suggestions/499247</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;Mikey95&quot;]Hi, before I get tons of flame saying I&#39;m new etc, I started ftp in 2002 &amp; members in 2004. I have seen a lot of changes in RuneScape, some good and some bad. In this thread I shall be putting forward my suggestions for changes that I believe could be positive. 

-Low/high detail option - This was part of the game all those years ago, some of you may remember the skeleton and the warrior who would help you decide which setting you wanted to play . Low detail removes ground decoration and also removes rooftops which is something that many people are finding very tedious. 

-Game frame selection - Sadly the game frame we are currently using is a very modern looking one and the previous oldschool one was only removed 5 days prior to this version of RS. A lot of people would love the old chat box, a torn up piece of parchment, as it made the game feel more unique and adventurous. Many illegal servers use older game frames and so I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t be hard for Jagex to get hold of one aswell. 

-Reversal of Varrock makeover - We have traveled back to a strange point in time where Varrock was the only major city to receive a makeover. Currently Varrock has the new look guards, which by the way feel far from &#39;old school&#39;, and I think most people would like to see the return of the iron chain bronze med guards along with the iconic Varrock fountain which has today been turned in to Varrock puddle. 

Old mining ores &amp; animation - It&#39;s very strange seeing half of the mining rocks as the old ones and half as the new ones I think that most people would like to see all the mining rocks with the old graphic &amp; the return of the old mining animation wouldn&#39;t upset many people either .

These are my first suggestions and I&#39;m sure that there will be many more over these, hopefully long, years of 07scape.
