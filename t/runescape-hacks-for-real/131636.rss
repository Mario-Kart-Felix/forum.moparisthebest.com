you can…pm admin<br>

lol, thats not really spam, i was asking if the hacks for runescape (not like item spawners) but, idk to learn like… u know the party hat thing that happend? were u could use died silk and a knife to make a party hat?</p>
<p>i wanna see if i could hack in there to learn that sfuf<br>
[/quote]Seems like you’ve spent your life googling for runescape cheats and found that shit from there? THAT’S NOT TRUE, when RS2 came out the items that people had on their accounts were transferred to rs2. People started abusing it by making a new account and going into rsc and giving the rares to the account and logging into rs2 so that 2 accounts had the rares. They kept doing it on and on and then Jagex had a huge mass ban, happy now?[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s not 100% true. This dupe did happen, but only in the beta - no items made it into “real” RS2, nobody was mass-banned, the beta was wiped when the real game launched and the duped items went with it.</p>

Wow. I thought people would KNOW why the fuck Kaitnieks is famous for. Fucking retards. Ever think of what SCAR stands for? Shite Compared To AutoRune. AutoRune was an actual hack. Anyone hear of the dupe of '03? THAT’S the Party Hat Dupe. They manipulated information sent to the server, and duped. I’m losing more and more faith in the community. There’s very few old schoolers left…<br>

<p>that shit is client side and they fixed it so its almost impossible unlless you do some packet editing and that probably wont work… yes it was done on kaitnieks i know that but forgot about it because that was before i cared about hacking rs…[/quote]</p>
<p>Lmfao. Don’t try to prove me wrong when you admit that you don’t know what the fuck your talking about. If you weren’t even around long enough to make shemales on rsc, and have some fun with TSearch, then stfu. Research before you tell people they’re wrong.</p>

              <p>That wasn’t client sided billy, it actually happened. Don’t you know how pink hats came into the game? Did you know they where nearly 5m a piece? Made by hackers, then later implemented into the game, and now is one of the most common items in the game. It all happened in RSC.</p>

<p>i wanna see if i could hack in there to learn that sfuf[/quote]Seems like you’ve spent your life googling for runescape cheats and found that shit from there? THAT’S NOT TRUE, when RS2 came out the items that people had on their accounts were transferred to rs2. People started abusing it by making a new account and going into rsc and giving the rares to the account and logging into rs2 so that 2 accounts had the rares. They kept doing it on and on and then Jagex had a huge mass ban, happy now?</p>
