    <title>How to make a npc that spawns another npc attackable?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-npc-that-spawns-another-npc-attackable/350841</link>
    <description>Hi. Can someone please tell me what i am doing wrong? The thing is that i saw the code of that monster from the jad mini game (the level 45 one) and when it dies, spawns 2 new npcs.
So i made a new mini game to my server using that kind of code but im having a small problem. I coded it all and added at npchandler.java, just as the level 45 monster, and the result was this:

if (npcs[i].npcType == 3676) {
spawnANPC(3601, temp.absX+1, temp.absY, temp.heightLevel);
spawnANPC(3601, temp.absX, temp.absY+1, temp.heightLevel);
}

I know that it means that it will spawn those npcs, but i just cant attack then.
I have added then to the npc list, to the auto spawn and when i attack then ( ranged,mage,melee) they can attack me back but the character doesnt even hit it. It doesnt even show 0s, just dont attack. I have put the code before the start of the jad mini game thing, i think it is not at a wrong spot.
I also searched client.java but did not found a thing.
So can please someone tell me the right code or what do i have to do to make those npcs attackable? Cause i&#39;ve spent a little time coding that mini game (about to 4 hours, cause made custom items to rewards, coded the npcs animations, drops, shop, etc) and i really want it to work...
Thank you all and hope that someone help me just as i do when i know how to. :)
