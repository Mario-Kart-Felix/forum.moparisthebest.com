    <title>I want to learn Java</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-want-to-learn-java/348915</link>
    <description>Hello, I have been messing with RSPS sources for a few years now, on and off. I am quite tired of not knowing what I am doing and having to constantly consult the forums. I&#39;ve decided to just learn the language so I can help myself. So getting to the point... is there a section of Java I should learn that relates to RSPS? Should I just learn all of Java? Where can I learn it?</description>
