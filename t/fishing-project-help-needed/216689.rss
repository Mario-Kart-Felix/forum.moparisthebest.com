    <title>Fishing Project! help needed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fishing-project-help-needed/216689</link>
    <description>Well, im planning to add fishing to my server, BUT I have no idea how, so please help me setting up this crap (soz (A) )...

I have kind of coding experience, lets say 6 or 7 out of 10, im not the best there is, but i can do alot, and i learn fast. So, is anyone able to help me with this stuff? Ill do most of the work, if neccecery, but at least what i can do... And credits go to everyone who helped so,

My goal is actually to make a quite complete fishing skill, if you&#39;re not really up to making the whole thing, then don&#39;t mind signing in, I&#39;m not really happy with people who give me two lines of code and then take off.
I want a fishing skill that includes:
-Info about the skill, most of that is covered already, wasn&#39;t so hard...
-Most of the fishing spots working (there are like 300 spots, wherefrom 4 id&#39;s are the same spots, no need to do double work..)
-Giving it XP ofcourse, a skill aint a skill without a reward..
-Maybye we&#39;ll build in a fishing cape thing, but I&#39;m considering not to bother that.

Currently on the project:
-Me :)
-My brother, doesnt have a mopar account but hes helping me out..
-?
-?

I guess fishing aint such a hard skill to make.. So, if you&#39;re a bit of a worker, and you maybye want to use this for your own server, you can, were working on it all together, so everyone gets to use it, so if you&#39;re willing to help out, and you might want this for your own server, help me out and sign up!

UPDATES:
Ive added the &#39;info&#39; file about fishing, clicking on the skill icon now gives a list of all available fish and wich levels and how to catch.
ive listed:
-shrimp(net)                      1
-sardine(bait)                    2
-herring(bait)                     2
-anchovies(net)                 1
-trout(fly)                         3
-herring(bait)                     2
-salmon(fly)                      3
-tuna(harpoon)                  4
-lobster(cage)                   5
-swordfish(harpoon)           4

These are also the only ones i want to be fishable yet, once we have the base we can expend it or leave it that way, im not to make that discision, because i dont mind actually :)</description>
