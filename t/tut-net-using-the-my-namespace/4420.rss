    <title>[TUT] .NET -&gt; Using the &quot;My&quot; namespace</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-net-using-the-my-namespace/4420</link>
    <description>[b]Introduction[/b]
The &quot;My&quot; namespace is probably one of the most powerful features of Visual Basic .NET. It allows quick access to a whole array of variables and functions.  The &quot;My&quot; namespace can be used to access the registry. Many VB6 veterans will know that some annoying API calls had to be made to use the registry. Now, it can be done in one single line!

The My namespace also contains some variables pertaining to things such as the clipboard, clock, and current. This quick tutorial will teach you a few things about the My namespace.

[b]Tutorial[/b]

[*]Load Visual Basic 2005. Start a new project and name it MyNamespace
[*]Draw two labels onto your form, and one textbox.
[*]Double click your form and add the following code:
[code]
Label1.Text = My.Computer.Clock.LocalTime.Date
        Label2.Text = My.Computer.Name
        If (My.Computer.Clipboard.ContainsText() = True) Then
            TextBox1.Text = My.Computer.Clipboard.GetText()
        Else
            TextBox1.Text = &quot;(Clipboard does not contain text!)&quot;
        End If
[/code]
(Note: It should go between &quot;Private Sub Form1_Load()&quot; and &quot;End Sub&quot;)
[*]Click the Green play button to begin debugging your project.

You should see something like this:

The first label is the date. The second label is your Computer Name. The textbox should contain whatever text was in your clipboard. If you didn&#39;t have any text in the clipboard, you should see &quot;(Clipboard does not contain text!)&quot;. That is because the function ContainsText() returns True if text is in your clipboard. It returns False if there is no text. 

[b]Homework[/b]
Use the pictureBox component of Visual Basic, and the clipboard to display a picture that was in the clipboard.

It should look something like this:

The first label is the date. The second label is your Computer Name. The textbox should contain whatever text was in your clipboard.
