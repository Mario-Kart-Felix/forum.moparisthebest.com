    <description>Hey,

I just downloaded a new source to play around with. There&#39;s one major problem i don&#39;t know how to fix though.
Whenever i make an account and login, it works just fine. If i logout and try to log back in it gives me the error; Error loading your profile. Please contact customer support.
This happends with every account i make, so it&#39;s not just 1 account that isn&#39;t working.

Does anyone know how to fix this problem? By the way, i&#39;m really new at coding so please explain step-by-step ^^
I use this source/client: https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,663645.0.html

EDIT:
Error log:
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.mina.filter.executor.ExecutorFilter).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.

Yes, i did try the suggestion made in the source release thread, but it doesn&#39;t even let me compile then..
Thanks in advance!
