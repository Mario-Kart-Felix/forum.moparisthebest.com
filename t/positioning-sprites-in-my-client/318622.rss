    <title>Positioning sprites in my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/positioning-sprites-in-my-client/318622</link>
    <description>Well, I was wondering where I would go in my client folder to change the position of my sprites? Here&#39;s a pic of what it looks like as of now; also that the ones the do work are the ones that aren&#39;t put together:

Reason being for blackening the chatbox out is because I don&#39;t want people seeing what is there yet. You see how the white letters as well as green aren&#39;t where they are supposed to be; they&#39;re too far up and same thing with the sprites for the friend&#39;s list and such. How would I position them so that they actually become centered and fit well? Help much appreciated.</description>
