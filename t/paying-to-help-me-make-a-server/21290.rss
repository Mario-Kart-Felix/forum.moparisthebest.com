    <title>Paying to help me make a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-to-help-me-make-a-server/21290</link>
    <description>Ok i&#39;m seriously confused about making a server, i tried for 3 hours using a guide on &quot;making you&#39;re on server&quot;

so if anyone asks me now &quot;did you do this&quot; &quot;did you do that&quot; the answer will probably be &quot;i don&#39;t know :S&quot;

If someone would take me step by step from step 1 i&#39;d happily make them admin (when i find out how to) and pay them 4m rs cash.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 01, 2006, 05:58:15 AM[/size][hr]i would obviously perfer someone who has allready made their own server and prehaps let me check it out if thats ok.</description>

              <p>I have a very good server but I would like to see proof of te 4mil first. add me on msn first and we will talk <a href="mailto:liamrobertson@hotmail.com">liamrobertson@hotmail.com</a> I could send you a fully working server all i’m doing now on it is putting some more item commands. My other runserver.bat screwed up so I’m fixing up my latest source. If so we do do this deal I will like a bit of it first and a bit later.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 01, 2006, 06:07:02 AM[/size][hr]I could also do a step by step guide. I’ve gone broke on runescape lately since i got hacked :p. I can send you some pictures possibly as well of the server i’m making.</p>
