    <title>My first C++ attempt</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-first-c-attempt/464056</link>
    <description>My friend told me that I should try to learn C++ rather than Java so I thought I&#39;d give it a go. He gave me a small task to complete. 

My task:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print &quot;Fizz&quot; instead of the number and for the multiples of five print &quot;Buzz&quot;. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My code:
[code=Cpp]#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {
        if(i%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; i%5 != 0) {
            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Fizz&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        } else if(i%3 != 0 &amp;&amp; i%5 == 0) {
            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Buzz&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        } else if(i%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; i%5 == 0) {
            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
        } else {
            cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}[/code]

I was wondering if anyone could tell me any points to improve.</description>

You can also optimize the conditionals by checking for multiples of 15 first, then for multiples of 3, then for multiples of 5, rather than doing two remainder calculations for each conditional. You can basically halve the number of modulus checks this way.<br>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/the">@The</a> Enforcer: I was talking about relative to the original code. He was doing upwards of 6 modulus checks for each iteration, whereas I pointed out his approach to solving it could be simplified and optimized by using less moduluses. And thanks for pointing out the shader languages are general purpose. I figure that was obvious. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> It’s worth mentioning them though, considering there’s also CG and various general purpose languages that are translated into shader languages to work around design flaws in those languages.</p>

Two modulus operations on each iteration? It depends on the value of <span class="bbcode-i">i</span>. You are talking about the original code, right?</p>

<p>What? My friend said that if I wanted to take game development seriously, I should learn C++. I am already competent in Java and so I am well aware that it’s not “bad”. Infact, we have already had a conversation about how Java is a good language - nice try, though.</p>
<p>Fat Cookies, I’ll look into that later.</p>

              <p>Well you’ve produced the standard, boring and non-flexible solution that most people would come up with. If I told you also print out “Bazz” for multiple of 7’s your code would require a substantial amount of editing and turn into a mess.</p>
<p>Try and rewrite the program so that you can easily add new keywords for new multiples (such as Bazz). Think about how you could utilize an array to do this.</p>

              <p>My friend told me that I should try to learn C++ rather than Java so I thought I’d give it a go. He gave me a small task to complete.</p>
<p>My task:</p>
<blockquote>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".</blockquote>
<p>My code:</p>
<p>[code=Cpp]<span class="hashtag">#include</span> </p>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>int main() {<br>
for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {<br>
if(i%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; i%5 != 0) {<br>
cout &lt;&lt; “Fizz” &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
} else if(i%3 != 0 &amp;&amp; i%5 == 0) {<br>
cout &lt;&lt; “Buzz” &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
} else if(i%3 == 0 &amp;&amp; i%5 == 0) {<br>
cout &lt;&lt; “FizzBuzz” &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
} else {<br>
cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
return 0;<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>I was wondering if anyone could tell me any points to improve.</p>
