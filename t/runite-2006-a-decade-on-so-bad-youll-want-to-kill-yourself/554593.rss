[size=24pt]&quot;SO BAD YOU&#39;LL WANT TO KILL YOURSELF&quot;
[/size]
[size=16pt]That is a quote from a beta tester who spent 1 week on the server, playing with two other people. Our belief at Runite is that he meant that the server is so bad ASS that you&#39;ll want to kill your real life and immerse yourself completely and utterly playing Runite forever. Yup.. Honest...[/CENTER][/size]

[CENTER][SIZE=4]At Runite we like to keep things brief, honest and to the point. We have downloaded a 2006 source, did some work on it (and continuing to do work on it with daily/weekly rolling updates) and decided to host. Why? Because we couldn&#39;t find a 2006 style server that was not the same vanilla XP rate (we do love vanilla ice cream though #FatBoys) and besides - we love the real old school game! [/SIZE]
[SIZE=4]
So if you want to get on the server and enjoy relatively fast XP rates that still give you a sense of achievement, a slightly boosted economy with better drop rates that will get you moving to where you want to be that bit faster, or indeed just want to kill yourself, then Runite is the place for you. [/SIZE]

[SIZE=4]For those that like to skill you will be delighted to know that all skills are working and trainable - some things you can&#39;t do at the moment like enchanting orbs or use ess pouches (so you can fill, but you can&#39;t empty - rather abyss like pouches atm) but we&#39;re working on those and a host of other updates to keep you entertained and enjoying your experience before you kill yourself.

And for those that like to mix in some PvMing action we have a host of bosses from 2006 that you can engage in fighting, as well as a flurry of new areas that will make PvMing and combat training in general feel less one dimensional - no more camping Green Drags! (unless that&#39;s your thing....)

The economy is designed so that all skills will make a contribution.. So you won&#39;t find an infinite supply of any item in the shops - if you want high level runes better find a runecrafter or get busy yourself - if you want a glory.. Well good luck on that one.. There are however shops such as our friend Oziach&#39;s (shout out to the big O Z) where you can get your rune platebody or green d&#39;hide body and for the herblawler&#39;s Mr Jatix will be happy to supply you with all the vials to content your heart, in a noted form ofcourse, which are in place to help speed up your game play and make things just a little bit easier than vanilla but not so vanilla where you will want to shoot yourself immediately (we&#39;re hoping for a survival time of about 2 weeks before you start grabbing for the revolver in your dad&#39;s drawer).

Our aim is to really promote PKing - nothing like PKing back in 2006 or early 2007 - so we will hold regular events including PK tournaments and PKer of the Season with IRL cash prizes, and generally do everything we can to satisfy players demands when it comes to taking someone else&#39;s items by killing them. 

That&#39;s pretty much it, not exactly a thread with 3d images that pop out at you and play a 2016 psy-dub-trance-mix but we&#39;re simple like that. Why don&#39;t you feast your eyes on some print screens instead.
