    <description>Ability to sell your work here / advertise selling your work. 
It&#39;s happening anyway, would up the quality a bit here if proper people sold their work here.</description>

              <p>The problem with selling anything is the potential for backlash. That’s why sales haven’t been allowed here - most of the staff simply don’t want to be liable for deals gone wrong.<br>
When SCAR scripts were sold on a more regular basis, they were sold multiple times. However custom jobs, like you guys are proposing, would be sold once or twice; it’s a lot of verification we’d have to do to ensure quality.</p>

              <p>Most of the RSC development has stopped because the only people who can code properly have gotten bored of the ungreatful ddos kiddie community we seem to have here (in the RSC section at least) and have either left or almost completely stopped development.</p>
<p>I think that allowing trusted coders to sell and advertise their services/code would benefit the coders themselves, the server owners and the community as a whole. And I say this as someone with absolutely nothing to gain as I wouldn’t be taking part in this.</p>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/moparisthebest">@Moparisthebest</a>: I’m not sure how often you visit the RSC side of these forums, but an old RSC source that Reines developed was leaked, and everyone has it. It’s the standard moparscape rsc server around now, and it’s very highly developed. About 85% of content is there, and all main/core features added, 100% playable.</p>
<p>People don’t want to buy new servers, they don’t want to spend a lot of time creating new servers, there’s not too much point with whats currently around, however people are interested in optimizations, and other features it does not have.</p>
<p>Which is what this threads about, Peter is asking (and i guess I’m asking too) if its possible to have some sort of sales, verified code monkeys who sell services and don’t fuck around, other person gets what they want, we get what we want.</p>
<p>I talked to Lothy about it while ago, he liked it but said it likely wouldn’t happen though you IIRC.</p>
<p>If this idea were to go ahead, obviously it would need verified people doing it, otherwise you’d get a bunch of people who at most know how to modify a string in a class, pretend they are pros at java (like a lot of people i’ve seen around the RS2 sections no offense) You’d get scammers and whatnot having it completely public.</p>

<p>Didn’t mean that. Basically asked if I’m allowed to sell my services here (Tried to sugarcoat it :P).</p>
<p>No point in starting a similar project for RSC, but some people might still pay to get some work done on their servers.</p>
