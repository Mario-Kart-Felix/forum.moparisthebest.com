[CENTER][size=20pt]Information:[/size][/CENTER]
UniQue is a server that was developed by Skiiii. I was a mod on the Beta from start to finish. I have gotten permission from Skiiii himself to continue the work. I have studied the emulous code and what all he has done so i wont let you all old unique players down. The server aims to captures features of runescape which are not seen in many other servers, and not half-assed jobs of them either. If you are one of those people who are like omg customs ruin teh server this server is not for you. This server does include: Vesta&#39;s Longsword, Statius Hammer, Galkon&#39;s Godbows, Dragon Claws, Dragon platebody and many other newer runescape items.

The idea of this server is also to make people work to achieve things. This doesn&#39;t mean its anywhere near as slow as runescape however. The exp rate will still be determined, b/c as before 30X was boring to some people? Items are also hard to obtain to keep a decent economy. Most items are obtained through slayer monster drops, monster drops, minigames and skills. Certain Pking items will have to be obtained through Lucifer and The fully working, with magic and melee, chaos elemental.

[code] First of its- kind!
Chest opens interface.

ArrayLists hold Object PartyItem which holds the Item ID and amount.

Added fully working Accept button. All items held on preList arraylist (items waiting to be added) are added to the chest when the button is clicked (irreversable).
Added fully working withdraw options, all options work, items re-arrange on the interface.
Bug fixes: Cannot withdraw or deposit more than available, stackable and non-stackable item support added.
Working lever implemented, requires 1k to pull and can not be pulled if there are no items in the chest.
Balloons implemented, once the lever is pulled several balloons appear for all players in the area, if you teleport to the area the objects update and appear for you too.
Prize system implemented, all items from the chest are placed into an array and there is a random chance of obtaining them from the balloons.
Stackable items are now split into several balloons containing a random amount (with a maximum of 10 different balloons with one type of item)
None-stackable items are spread into an amount of balloons equal to the amount of the item in the chest, one per balloon.
All balloon objects disappear once the party has ended.[/code]

This server does include: Vesta’s Longsword, Statius Hammer, Galkon’s Godbows, Dragon Claws, Dragon platebody and many other newer runescape items.</p>
<p>The idea of this server is also to make people work to achieve things. This doesn’t mean its anywhere near as slow as runescape however. The exp rate will still be determined, b/c as before 30X was boring to some people? Items are also hard to obtain to keep a decent economy. Most items are obtained through slayer monster drops, monster drops, minigames and skills. Certain Pking items will have to be obtained through Lucifer and The fully working, with magic and melee, chaos elemental.</p>

<p>[COLOR=Red]Party Room:[/COLOR][COLOR=Lime]100%[/COLOR]</p>
<p><code> First of its- kind!
Chest opens interface.
Created a new PartyRoom class.
Created two ArrayLists, preList and dropList which contain the items you are adding to the chest, and the items in the chest.
ArrayLists hold Object PartyItem which holds the Item ID and amount.
Added fully working deposit, adds the item to the correct ArrayList, all deposit options work, items display on the interface.
Added fully working Accept button. All items held on preList arraylist (items waiting to be added) are added to the chest when the button is clicked (irreversable).
Added fully working withdraw options, all options work, items re-arrange on the interface.
Bug fixes: Cannot withdraw or deposit more than available, stackable and non-stackable item support added.
Working lever implemented, requires 1k to pull and can not be pulled if there are no items in the chest.
Balloons implemented, once the lever is pulled several balloons appear for all players in the area, if you teleport to the area the objects update and appear for you too.
Prize system implemented, all items from the chest are placed into an array and there is a random chance of obtaining them from the balloons.
Stackable items are now split into several balloons containing a random amount (with a maximum of 10 different balloons with one type of item)
None-stackable items are spread into an amount of balloons equal to the amount of the item in the chest, one per balloon.
All balloon objects disappear once the party has ended.</code><br>
