    <description>[center]Hi hi. Saradomin is POSSIBLY looking for one more developer.
Currently we have a team of 5 developers and myself. We have been working on this project mainly in the dark for months. Were using version control and issue control. In a process of finishing our new framework. The team has many very known rsps developers. The entire team is in some type of Computer Science class at some type of college currently. One member of the team is majored in CS. The team has money to push it to the top through ads at the time of release. 

If interested 
Email me:&quot;chris@ruzylo.com&quot;
Skype me:&quot;TheRuzylo&quot;
PM ME.

This is all the details I will release until the official release of the beta or server. 
If in fact you are interested. I will tell you more under the condition we find you a good fit and wed like to tell you more. 
Thank you, Ruzylo.
(If the members on the team choose to be known they will post here as I have linked them.)[/center]
