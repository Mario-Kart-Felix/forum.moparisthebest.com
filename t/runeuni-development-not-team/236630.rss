    <description>[b]RuneUni Development (Not Team)[/b]
Some people know that I have been doing a development on a server called &quot;Rune Uni&quot;.
Some of you might not know about it or how good it is but according to some third party program I got I have approximately 2400 - 3000 character accounts crated daily and 400 are active members.
Forums are doing quite well, I have not been posting much on them but the players have.

[b]Server[/b]
[i]Just a little something to show you what I got on my server and basically encourage you to join my server (I will not advertise here)[/i]
The server has been online for a little under 4 weeks now and has been quite successful in many ways. 
The forum has 2353 posts from some active members. Server has approximately 40 - 50 players online all the time (Not dedicated)
We have a few videos on youtube and here is the latest one (Uploaded 10 minutes ago)

http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=3g2EeiXW4IY

The is the official trailer for RuneUni and it was made by me in around 30 minutes using Sony vegas pro 8.

[b]Other[/b]
People think this is a Deltascape source, but it is not, I can make sure of that it was made by my previous release of winterlove v.2 - v.3
The reason behind people thinking it is a Deltascape source is because of the monster layouts, for example the island with moss giants and elf warriors. What is did do was take a few npcs from Deltascape source and paste into my Autospawn log, yes i know I leeched that part but I was not going though over 400 npcs for the sake of it.
It has some different things, new client, new rune armour, no lag and helpful staff members that always have fun.

[b]Pictures[/b]
[i]Here are the pictures of the server.[/i]

[b]Point[/b]
[quote=&quot;Thug-life, post:1, topic:219388&quot;][b]3)[/b] No development [b]teams[/b], however, showing off your recent development in runescape servers is accepted. We can make exceptions to the no development teams rule, pm a member of staff first.[/quote]
So it is allowed.</description>

Mrs Extro Limited made Winterlove? or did i read posts wrong … Because winterlove started runescape servers basically right?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>winterLove was made by winterLove. It was the first private server. Ms. Extro expanded upon winterLove, just liek the rest of us.[/quote]<br>
And added a lot of stuff, kinda stable. Well more stable than dodian anyway.</p>

Some people know that I have been doing a development on a server called “Rune Uni”.<br>
Some of you might not know about it or how good it is but according to some third party program I got I have approximately 2400 - 3000 character accounts crated daily and 400 are active members.<br>
Forums are doing quite well, I have not been posting much on them but the players have.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Server</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Just a little something to show you what I got on my server and basically encourage you to join my server (I will not advertise here)</span><br>
The server has been online for a little under 4 weeks now and has been quite successful in many ways.<br>
The forum has 2353 posts from some active members. Server has approximately 40 - 50 players online all the time (Not dedicated)<br>
We have a few videos on youtube and here is the latest one (Uploaded 10 minutes ago)</p>

<p>The is the official trailer for RuneUni and it was made by me in around 30 minutes using Sony vegas pro 8.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Other</span><br>
People think this is a Deltascape source, but it is not, I can make sure of that it was made by my previous release of winterlove v.2 - v.3<br>
The reason behind people thinking it is a Deltascape source is because of the monster layouts, for example the island with moss giants and elf warriors. What is did do was take a few npcs from Deltascape source and paste into my Autospawn log, yes i know I leeched that part but I was not going though over 400 npcs for the sake of it.<br>
It has some different things, new client, new rune armour, no lag and helpful staff members that always have fun.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Pictures</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Here are the pictures of the server.</span><br>
