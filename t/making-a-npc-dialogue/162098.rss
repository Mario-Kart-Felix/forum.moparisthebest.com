    <description>hi all
thx for readig this post

i&#39;m trying to make some kind of traveling in my server and if it works good i&#39;m going to make a TuT for it but i&#39;m stuck at 1 thing so i hoped you could help.

i want to have a NPC that opens a dialogue but when i tryed to make 1 it doesn&#39;t work does some 1 know how to make a working 1?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 02, 2007, 06:34:38 AM[/size][hr]as i can see nobody knows it?

i tryed zoeken.nl (somekind of google) and used the search here but without succes i asked 3 times for help with this but without succes either 

so i think i can better delete my traveling thing wich i wanted to make as a TuT so ppl could use it i only needed this to complete it</description>
