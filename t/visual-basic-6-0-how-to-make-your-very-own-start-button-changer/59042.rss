    <title>[Visual Basic 6.0] How to make your very own Start button changer :)</title>

    <description>I Hope you like this tut. But instead of using ResHacker you can use this more efficantly :)

First the Declarations (For the top of your code)
[code]Private Const WM_SETTEXT = &amp;HC
Private Const WM_GETTEXT = &amp;HD
Private Declare Function FindWindow Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;FindWindowA&quot; (ByVal lpClassName As String, ByVal lpWindowName As String) As Long
Private Declare Function FindWindowEx Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;FindWindowExA&quot; (ByVal hWnd1 As Long, ByVal hWnd2 As Long, ByVal lpsz1 As String, ByVal lpsz2 As String) As Long
Private Declare Function SendMessageSTRING Lib &quot;user32&quot; Alias &quot;SendMessageA&quot; (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, ByVal wParam As Long, ByVal lParam As String) As Long[/code]

Now add this anywhere in your code :)
[code]Public Sub SetStartCaption(str As String)
   Dim StartBar As Long
   Dim StartBarText As Long
   Dim sCaption As String
   StartBar = FindWindow(&quot;Shell_TrayWnd&quot;, vbNullString)
   StartBarText = FindWindowEx(StartBar, 0&amp;, &quot;button&quot;, vbNullString)
   sCaption = Left(str, 5)
   SendMessageSTRING StartBarText, WM_SETTEXT, 256, sCaption
   Exit Sub
   End Sub[/code]
This just finds your start button and changes the caption in use with the following:

Now Create a Command Button and name it &quot;cmdChange&quot;
Now go back to our code and put this in:
You can do this 2 ways.
Method 1: if you want the person who is using the application to be able to change it create a textbox and name it &quot;Text1&quot;
the code for this is:
[code]
Private Sub cmdChange_Click()
SetStartCaption Text1.Text
End Sub[/code]
Method 2:
If you want it so when the user runs your application it changes to what you want use this code:(you don&#39;t need a textbox for this method. just a command button)
[code]
Private Sub cmdChange_Click()
SetStartCaption &quot;Change this to what you want :)&quot;
End Sub[/code]

Thats it!

Please note this only works for the default windows theme and can only withhold 5 numbers/letters
