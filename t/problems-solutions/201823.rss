    <description>[i]I suggest that you read this the whole way through. I&#39;m not in the mood to answer questions that have already been answered.[/i]

Well i am sure that we are all aware of the massive divide in the player base. On one side, we have mitbs and on the other we have moparscapers. This divide has been visible since the release of Moparscape. The division was also pushed forward by the separation of the forums. It&#39;s clear that they are two different communities. One requires spoon feeding and the other requires a bit of self reliance. Either way, they both cater for two different things. 

The problem with one of them is that it isn&#39;t a proper community (moparscape). It&#39;s just individuals looking out for themselves. To become a proper community:

1. Names should be known and the individuals who have power should be known. This is a massive downfall for this community (mscp). Power is not known and is therefore not respected. A solution to this will be given a bit later...

2. Community projects should be ran and community threads should be made. By &#39;community threads&#39;, i refer to threads that require the activity of other members. Forum games. Also note, that by &#39;community project&#39;, i don&#39;t mean private server development for someone else.

3. There is nowhere for people to have a community discussion. Which brings me to my solution.

You see, a &#39;Community Discussion&#39; forum is required if we wish to improve the community from it&#39;s current state. It would allows every problem (the ones above) to be fixed and would provide the members a way of contributing to the community with their opinions. Nothing more needs to be said with this.

I also suggest the removal of the reputation system and the implementation of  a &#39;currency system&#39;. By that, i mean a system that allows the users to distribute &#39;fake money&#39; around. You are able to get it by helping other members and whoever gives money, will also have that amount withdrawn from his forum account. The problem with the rep system is that the other users have nothing to lose by reping people. The rewards? Perhaps access to a certain forum or a forum award of sorts. Everyone will be going for it so they will not give their money out so easily.

[u]Perhaps[/u]: http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/index.php?mod=65

Clear cut? I think so. I did not bother creating the next Berlin Wall with text, so i tried to summarize it as much as possible. Though there are a few problems with it, any responses to this thread should be able to fix them. If the responses don&#39;t expand this suggestion, then i assume that the community has completely failed and that it has no desire to improve upon it&#39;s current state. Though, it&#39;s not my responsibility to care about it. Before you post, please understand that there have been two suggestions made in this thread. Don&#39;t live in ignorance.</description>

<p>Tree tried hard but tree does not see that moparscape is complete fail, he believes it is partial fail and can be recovered. This is not the case. It is fail, has failed and will never cease to… fail.</p>

              <p>I agree with your suggestions 100%.</p>
<p>But, for the community discussion part, we would have to keep that VERY organized and clean. No spam, no ‘general dicussion’; none of that crap. It’d have to be strictly moderated, so this means we would need our user-moderation powers (mute, warn, moderate, etc.) back.</p>
<p>Following my last statement about those powers, THAT is the biggest factor in this no-respect problem as of right now. Why? Because we are very, very limited on power. I dont mean to try and sound like a power hog. I’m being serious. Individuals here think they can get away with just about anything because we cant even touch them. Yes, we can get others to do something about it, but most of the higher-ranked staff members are rarely on or simply do not care about this ‘side’ of the community. I’ve spoken to Moparisthebest, and he has mentioned that he has been working on that. He has to sort out a few bugs, but hopefully, it’ll be done soon enough so we can get this idea of yours up and running.</p>
<p>Your currency system suggestion is a great, and needed, idea. We’ve gotta put that into action as well. Reputation right now, like you have said, is pointless. You do not lose anything, and as of right now there is no limit on how much we can give away. If I wanted to, I can move from person to person down the member list giving out a few rep. points. It means nothing. So, yes, I love your currency idea.</p>
<p>Also, in my opinion, we’ll have to start doing something here about the immaturity and intelligence levels. Instead of us going around flaming the members for doing something wrong, we should stop, take some time off, and tell them WHY its wrong. That way, they learn something, and advance up the ladder here at MSCP. Without some kind of a <span class="bbcode-i">strong</span> push, most of the members here wont get far at all.</p>

<p>You see, a ‘Community Discussion’ forum is required if we wish to improve the community from it’s current state. It would allows every problem (the ones above) to be fixed and would provide the members a way of contributing to the community with their opinions. Nothing more needs to be said with this.</p>

If I’m thinking right, they would probably consider this a general discussion and spam it up.
