[size=12pt]After seeing people using the same bases, adding the same stuff, and generally making a server that constantly requires heavy maintenance, I have decided to build a server from SCRATCH. And i don&#39;t mean, using a nearly blank source, I mean opening up JCreator, Eclipse, or whatever IDE you&#39;re using, and clicking &quot;New Project&quot; and starting from there. Therefore It will eliminate the need for retro-fitting different tutorials, and generally causing the server to be severely unstable.


Note: I will not have any pictures for the moment, My computer that has most of my server files on it, it&#39;s USB Interface died. So until i get that back(hopefully today), This will just be a development thread, without the pics.[/size][/center]

Progression:

[ul][li]Incorporated MySQL to Store &amp; Load Server Information(Eliminating the need for Thousands of character files)[/li]
[li]Efficient Package Structure[/li]
[li]80% Completion of All F2P Quests[/li]
[li]Decided to douche the server, and re structure following most java conventions[/li][/ul]


That&#39;s all I can remember for the moment. Hopefully I get  my computer back today, so that i keep a more up-to-date progression monitor.
