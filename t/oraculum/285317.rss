[size=12pt]The next greatest RSPS 317 Framework[/size]
[/center]

[size=24pt]Who are you?[/size]
        My name is Zyle. But, depending on what community you are familiar with, I am also zyle1992, and Zymus. I have worked with Private servers since &#39;06, because I had a vision for a better server. One that would rival the very foundation of Jagex itself. And this is what I hope to accomplish. 


[size=24pt]What is Oraculum?[/size]
        Oraculum is based on a server framework I am developing. I like to say that it is written from scratch, but that isn&#39;t 100% true. I will be the only one working on it, and all the methods I write will be in my own style (Yes, I have my own style of Java coding). The reason it isn&#39;t 100% from scratch, is because I will be looking at different servers(as a reference), and compare the code I have with their code, in order to create the most efficient, most powerful server to date.
        It is going to be a 100% ORIGINAL 317 server, with the classic 377 cache. In order to &quot;bring back the oldies&quot; you might say. No custom items, no edited game-frames, no custom icons, or interfaces, or maps, or anything like that. Adding things like that just seem to lag the client, and add extra content that no one ever bothers to develop(Look at Bluur&#39;s servers and clients if you don&#39;t believe me...). A waste of time, space, and opportunity. My hope is that Oraculum will end this. I do plan on editing the client a small bit, but still keeping a classic feel to it.


[size=24pt]What can I, as a potential member of Oraculum expect?[/size]
        One thing I hate, and have always hated, is people that only take a job half-way. People that are completely satisfied with doing a half-assed job. I only strive for the best, because anything less than the best is a felony(Thanks Rob ^_^). In Oraculum, you can expect a multitude of things that no one has dared attempt before. Full completeness of a server is just one of them. My guarantee to you is that over a short period of time, you will be able to:

[ul][li]Experience each skill to it&#39;s absolute fullest potential[/li]
[li]Go on EVERY Quest that is available(just like the original RuneScape)[/li]
[li]Play each Mini-game, with 99-100% absolute parallel to that of RuneScape&#39;s[/li]
[li]And much, much more...[/li][/ul]



[size=24pt]How do we know you&#39;re not full of BS?[/size]
        Like I said earlier, I only settle for the absolute best of everything.I have developed ZymusScape, am Co-Owner of DragonScape(My cousin&#39;s server based of ZymusScape), AlienScape, and Rare-scape. Just to name a few. I have also created many applications in order to aid in the development of servers.

        Noctem, is a Server editor I created, that allows you to edit (almost) any aspect of the server with a powerful GUI, integrated with MySQL. In order to ease the clutter of thousands of different character files, and config files. You can change anything from Armor bonuses, to Npc locations, to what model to load when equipping an item, with the ease of an unclustered GUI. All server-sided of course.

        Lexicon, is a scripting engine I am still developing. One of the basic functions is String-parsing and execution. For example, let&#39;s say that we have a method that gives a quest reward at the completion of said quest. Now instead of using, let&#39;s say 5-10 lines for EACH quest reward (1000 - 2000 total MINIMUM), I just use a method, and pull the script from the MySQL database. So instead of this:
[code]
if(completedQuest(15)) {
    Frames.showInterface(player, XXXX);
    Frames.setStrings(player, XXXX, &quot;Some line&quot;, &quot;Some other line&quot;, &quot;Yet another line, etc.&quot;);
    player.addItem(YYYY, 1);
    player.addQuestPoints(3);
}
[/code]

        I could simply do this:
[code]
if(player.completedQuest(15)) {//Can also use a String instead of an Integer, to replace both 15&#39;s
    Lexicon.parseAndExecute(player, 15);
}
[/code]

        Which would pull from the MySQL Database(With the ID of the Quest being 15):
[code]
INTERFACE:XXXX;
SET_STRINGS:XXXX, Some Line, Some other line, &quot;Yet another line, etc.&quot;;
ADD_ITEM:YYYY, 1;
ADD_QP:3;
[/code]

        Which takes up alot less space in the class files(For all you Custom Item users, you should probably do something like this to avoid the &quot;code too large&quot; error when your method18 is greater than 64 Kb...)


[size=24pt]Progress[/size]
        Well, I&#39;m not going to lie. When creating something like this, you are bound to run into some road bumps, and may even need to take another whole route to get to your destination. But, you will always end up there eventually. Here&#39;s what I have so far:
[code]
Perfect Auto-IP-Banning (Prevents SYI, and AGF)
Perfect User Banning
Logging in
Side-icons to load
[/code]

[size=24pt]Currently Working On[/size]
[code]
Character Rendering
Personal Shops
Stopping auto-disconnect on login(Packets possibly?)
[/code]

[size=24pt]Pictures[/size]
Login

        [size=12pt]Thank you all for taking the time to read my thread, and I will try to keep information up to date as often as I can. I&#39;m on summer vacation now, so I should be able to get this working fairly quickly.[/size]

[right][size=12pt]Kindest regards,

It will be easy, in the sense that beginners will be able to make a decent server from it, and advanced users will be able to make outstanding servers.</p>

              <p>[center][size=36pt]Oraculum[/size]<br>
[size=12pt]The next greatest RSPS 317 Framework[/size]<br>
[/center]</p>
<p>[size=24pt]Who are you?[/size]<br>
My name is Zyle. But, depending on what community you are familiar with, I am also zyle1992, and Zymus. I have worked with Private servers since '06, because I had a vision for a better server. One that would rival the very foundation of Jagex itself. And this is what I hope to accomplish.</p>
<p>[size=24pt]What is Oraculum?[/size]<br>
Oraculum is based on a server framework I am developing. I like to say that it is written from scratch, but that isn’t 100% true. I will be the only one working on it, and all the methods I write will be in my own style (Yes, I have my own style of Java coding). The reason it isn’t 100% from scratch, is because I will be looking at different servers(as a reference), and compare the code I have with their code, in order to create the most efficient, most powerful server to date.<br>
It is going to be a 100% ORIGINAL 317 server, with the classic 377 cache. In order to “bring back the oldies” you might say. No custom items, no edited game-frames, no custom icons, or interfaces, or maps, or anything like that. Adding things like that just seem to lag the client, and add extra content that no one ever bothers to develop(Look at Bluur’s servers and clients if you don’t believe me…). A waste of time, space, and opportunity. My hope is that Oraculum will end this. I do plan on editing the client a small bit, but still keeping a classic feel to it.</p>
<p>[size=24pt]What can I, as a potential member of Oraculum expect?[/size]<br>
One thing I hate, and have always hated, is people that only take a job half-way. People that are completely satisfied with doing a half-assed job. I only strive for the best, because anything less than the best is a felony(Thanks Rob ^_^). In Oraculum, you can expect a multitude of things that no one has dared attempt before. Full completeness of a server is just one of them. My guarantee to you is that over a short period of time, you will be able to:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Experience each skill to it’s absolute fullest potential[/li]<br>
[li]Go on EVERY Quest that is available(just like the original RuneScape)[/li]<br>
[li]Play each Mini-game, with 99-100% absolute parallel to that of RuneScape’s[/li]<br>
[li]And much, much more…[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[size=24pt]How do we know you’re not full of BS?[/size]<br>
Like I said earlier, I only settle for the absolute best of everything.I have developed ZymusScape, am Co-Owner of DragonScape(My cousin’s server based of ZymusScape), AlienScape, and Rare-scape. Just to name a few. I have also created many applications in order to aid in the development of servers.</p>
<pre><code>    Noctem, is a Server editor I created, that allows you to edit (almost) any aspect of the server with a powerful GUI, integrated with MySQL. In order to ease the clutter of thousands of different character files, and config files. You can change anything from Armor bonuses, to Npc locations, to what model to load when equipping an item, with the ease of an unclustered GUI. All server-sided of course.

    Lexicon, is a scripting engine I am still developing. One of the basic functions is String-parsing and execution. For example, let's say that we have a method that gives a quest reward at the completion of said quest. Now instead of using, let's say 5-10 lines for EACH quest reward (1000 - 2000 total MINIMUM), I just use a method, and pull the script from the MySQL database. So instead of this:
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(completedQuest(15)) {
    Frames.showInterface(player, XXXX);
    Frames.setStrings(player, XXXX, "Some line", "Some other line", "Yet another line, etc.");
    player.addItem(YYYY, 1);
    player.addQuestPoints(3);
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>    I could simply do this:
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(player.completedQuest(15)) {//Can also use a String instead of an Integer, to replace both 15's
    Lexicon.parseAndExecute(player, 15);
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>    Which would pull from the MySQL Database(With the ID of the Quest being 15):
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">INTERFACE:XXXX;
SET_STRINGS:XXXX, Some Line, Some other line, "Yet another line, etc.";
ADD_ITEM:YYYY, 1;
ADD_QP:3;</code></pre>
<pre><code>    Which takes up alot less space in the class files(For all you Custom Item users, you should probably do something like this to avoid the "code too large" error when your method18 is greater than 64 Kb...)
</code></pre>
<p>[size=24pt]Progress[/size]<br>
Well, I’m not going to lie. When creating something like this, you are bound to run into some road bumps, and may even need to take another whole route to get to your destination. But, you will always end up there eventually. Here’s what I have so far:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Perfect Auto-IP-Banning (Prevents SYI, and AGF)
Perfect User Banning
Logging in
Side-icons to load</code></pre>
<p>[size=24pt]Currently Working On[/size]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Character Rendering
Personal Shops
Stopping auto-disconnect on login(Packets possibly?)</code></pre>
<p>[size=24pt]Pictures[/size]<br>
