[hr]

Here I am, again with another topic. But, this one is more serious than my others. This topic discusses about our community.

[hr]

[center][shadow=red,left]Why I made this topic[/shadow][/center]
You might be thinking,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is this freaking ahole keep making dumb topics?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Well, if you are one of these people, here is why. As soon as I read this post,
[quote=&quot;Kidpaparoach, post:12, topic:433800&quot;]This community is a bizzarre community, thats why. I think that there are many young people in this community(like myself) who don&#39;t contribute and not enough who do contribute and that is what the site is lacking and if the community wont improve maybe the advertising should improve. I prefer this site to Rune-srv(I only use r-serv for rsps purposes though) but if I actually want to know how to do something I&#39;ll generally go to r-serv to learn something if not post on both cause this community isn&#39;t very helpful in comparison.[/quote]
I started to think, [size=18pt]why?[/size]

[hr]

[center][shadow=red,left]Our Community[/shadow][/center]
How [u][b]our community[/b][/u] acts is bizarre, just as stated from Kidpaparoach. [u][b]Our community[/b][/u] acts like kindergardeners and pre-k&#39;s combined. The main reason is, [size=18pt]why?[/size] My topic, [i]Why? Just Why?[/i] also implies to this topic.

[hr]

[center][shadow=red,left]Server Help[/shadow][/center]

[center]Why: Excessive spam of unnecessary topics.[/center]

[hr]

I always see people in Server Help with things such as adding an item. I can understand, they are new. However, people in this forums (this time, this sometimes includes ME) hog into easy answers and don&#39;t answer harder or intermediate ones. Why? If a good coder, for example jaruanna, is posting a topic for help, people are too busy helping the easy ones (this applies to those who actually know the answer to the question but ignore it). I have noticed, when jaruanna for example posts [i]How to assign a variable a value from another method?[/i], then I only see 1 - 3 replies, mostly the replies aren&#39;t helpful. I think people should start [b]learning from there codes they get[/b], and start observing other codes for your answer. I told my friend that you should observe to get accomplishments. Why don&#39;t you? This means, if you need help with say a command like [i]How to add ::staffzone command?[/i]. Did you observe the code the lovely developers gave you? Why didn&#39;t you look at the commands before you ask. If you don&#39;t know how to observe code, there is also a billion tutorials on adding command. Why don&#39;t you observe? Rather you directly ask the question, and with that personality, I KNOW, FOR SURE, when a person gives you the code, you will copy and paste, no studying the code, no nothing. Can you see people such as Davidi2, who gradually improved. You can see is first post to his last post in Server Help, you can see 100% improvement. You can say same thing for imsuperman05. When he started, he was a total idiot from how he spoke (no offense to him), but do you see him now (besides his flaming)? He has improved, writes tutorials, and helps people (sometimes, no offense). Why? Because he studied the code, and studied hard. I advice all newcomers, please, improve on your coding skills from each step you learn, you will emerge victorious in server coding. This is what other people are saying:

[quote=&quot;Rodgerwilco, post:41, topic:433800&quot;]The problem is people don&#39;t learn java, they learn how to c.sendMessage(&quot;Hey I sent this message&quot;); without learning wtf java is.

Like I stated before... create a java docs that utilizes private server functionality and have a link to it next to the rs wiki^up top. Then create a server help section and a private server help section (for people who have lets say 50+ rep) for more serious matters.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;Arham 4&quot;]I push myself by bargaining a billion projects on me just to get use to programming. People who make framework from scratch are like the people I wis to be like. To be a higher level.[/quote]

[quote=&quot;the elve age, post:45, topic:433800&quot;]I understand that people will thrive to be better, and I have nothing against that, but when people claim to know full blown java when &quot;programming&quot; some s***ty base someone MADE for them, it just drives me crazy.[/quote]

[hr]

[center][shadow=red,left]Server Development and Development Teams[/shadow][/center]

[center]Why: Excessive Flamming[/center]

[hr]

I have also noticed Server Development and Development Teams get a billion flames a day. Yes,

[sup]1,000,000,000,000[/sup]/[sub]fpd (flames per a day)[/sub]

People here say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;LEECH!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;SUCKS!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;You serious?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Looks like my poo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All part of the billion spams per a day. But, just to ask, [size=18pt]why?[/size] I thought we were a community, not a spam place. The community helps, even if they don&#39;t like the server, you still comment in an okay way. This would be an acceptable message,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It&#39;s okay, but still you can work on it more. It has some features good, okay, and totally horrible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With this communities personality, idk how this message would be. Oh yes, I know,

&lt;blockquote&gt;S**t ahole server that has the most f**cking ridiculous features that I can make in one second!

F**cking idiotic server.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, if this is your message, your a cruel person. [size=18pt]Do you notice this person is putting their time and effort just to make a server he believes will be successful?[/size] You notice you making a f**cking ridiculous comment to just dampen his effort? Do you know that your message backfires at you? Do you see that just from that, in one point in your life you will come crying to that person saying something like,

[quote=&quot;person&quot;]How do I make an int?[/quote]

Why should he help (unless he&#39;s like me who doesn&#39;t take flame from this community seriously) you, the person who put a f**cking ridiculous comment stating he has a f**cking ridiculous server?

[hr]

[center][shadow=red,left]Server Downloads[/shadow][/center]

[center]Why: Excessive spam, flame, and gravedigging.[/center]

[hr]

Server downloads is a total disaster. There is both the elements of Server Help, Server Development, and Development Teams. Mostly, the disaster is what takes place in Server Development and Development Teams. Again, a billion flames a day. But wait, there&#39;s the disaster of Server Development and Development Teams, but then also the disaster at Server Help. But it doesn&#39;t end there, there&#39;s a new threat, gravedigging! [size=18pt]We call ourselves a &quot;community&quot;, but how are we one if one person cannot get along with another?[/size] A community is a whole group of people with brotherhood, not a lousy place where if I server doesn&#39;t look good, we go ahead and haunt them for there life and feast on their organs. You notice how Alphapkz or r-server are a community. R-server has a whole group of people symbolizing brotherhood, they have community announcements that are approved from the community itself. By seeing Alphapkz, I noticed, each decision is depended on the communities thoughts. See, look at [url=http://alphapkz.com/forums/news-updates/alpha-pkz-name-change!-p/]this[/url] topic. Watch as they make a judgement together. Now, if someone makes a bad name, that person doesn&#39;t flame, they just say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nah, this is better...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I cannot say anything about gravedigging, but flaming has been explained right now. Spams been explained in Server Help. SO whats more? We need a community!

[hr]

One the topic is quite interesting. Two that post is completely incorrect and made me :fp:. If I was I mod I would get the irresistible urge to infract him for stupidity and maybe backseat moderating. I probably wouldn’t, but god. Can’t people be grateful for one second and actually say something constructive? It’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>Also at the community not being productive as a whole, I agree. Just an example, here have been multiple tutorials on rune-server for apollo. Tons of plugins and the like. I haven’t seen any besides the one tutorial I posted for npc updating. (&lt;3 zuppers) Hell, the only people I know on here that have even touched apollo are zuppers and I. Apollo isn’t a terribly complicated server to get used to, although the degree of abstraction is a bit excessive at times.</p>
<p>Maybe if the community server actually got off the ground we would start getting people want to learn and to be better at programming. Either that or a series of tutorials created by more of the “elite” programmers of the site to understand the basics and the more advanced aspects of the client and runescape protocol. I understand that is what the wiki is for… maybe we should advertise that more on the site somewhere. Or maybe create a redirect board how they did for the mopardev forums as a subsection to server help. And maybe offer badges to users that regularly update the wiki to create an incentive for people to write articles on the wiki… I don’t know. Just my two cents on the matter. /rant[/quote]</p>
<p>Ehem. Nvmd I removed it.</p>
<p>Moparscape operates like a dysfunctional family.</p>
