    <description>Hey!

I was looking at &#39;fixing NPC noclip&#39; tutorial and I had two errors that I had a hard time with... They are - 

[code].\server\npcs\NPC.java:7: cannot find symbol
symbol  : class Tile
location: class server.npcs.NPC
        private Tile currentTile;
                ^
.\Server\Server.java:22: cannot access server.players.WalkingCheck
bad class file: .\server\players\WalkingCheck.java
file does not contain class server.players.WalkingCheck
Please remove or make sure it appears in the correct subdirectory of the classpa
th.
                        WalkingCheck.check();
                        ^
2 errors
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

Now to make long ERROR(Not story :P) short, the class file cannot locate the other class file I&#39;m trying to &#39;import,&#39; NPC.java is in ./server/npc/, Tile.java is in ./server/players/. I never told the class file that &#39;in order to locate the class file, you must change directory,&#39; which leads me to my question.

How can I make it so that the class file is able to locate a different class file that it outside the folder.

I&#39;m sorry for my bad wording, it&#39;s hard to explain it, I personally thing that the batch file error is more explanatory than my two paragraphs ^^

Anyways,
Thanks in advance!
