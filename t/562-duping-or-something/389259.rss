    <title>562 Duping or something</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-duping-or-something/389259</link>
    <description>Basically, the player withdraws 17 of an item and their cash.
Then they open up a shop, and click the &quot;Buy 10&quot; option.
They get the 10 items without wasting their cash, and they repeatedly do it until they receive max cash.
Any way to fix this? I&#39;ve already disabled selling items to shops, but now players find it hard to get money.
