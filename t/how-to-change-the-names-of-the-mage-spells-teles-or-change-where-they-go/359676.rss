    <description>Some shit I have to say:
I have been answering peoples questions for days and not 1 rep up, i KNOW THAT MY REP WAS DELETED FOR A BS PURPOSE.

[b]Difficulty[/b] LIKE 0/10
[b]CREDITS[/b]
I an writing this tut, there may be so out there but I don&#39;t know, this is written by me and only me.

[b]Step 1[/b]
Go into your source, scroll down and find your &quot;Texthandler.java&quot; file, i will update after i get my comp back, it will then have pics
 
[b]step 2[/b]
Common sense search for (CTRL+F) one of the tele spells names, after you do so you should find the name and under it the description along with the tele coords and all else there then  change, if you want to go and change the whole tele...

[b]OPTIONAL change tele location[/b]
So go into your game and find the place you want it to be, do ::mypos to get your ABSy and ABSx, save them then find a spell you want to make tele there in your spell book.
[b]step 2[/b]
go into your Texthandler.Java and search that tele spells name, then change name, discription and coordinates.


THIS IS PRETTY BASIC PLEASE NOTE THAT I WILL UPDATE IT WHEN I GET UNTO MY COMPUTER WITH MY SOURCE AND SUCH THIS HAS BEEN TESTED ON, USA-PKZ, SIMPLYSCAPE=MY SERVER, AND ALSOEVOLUTIONX.</description>
