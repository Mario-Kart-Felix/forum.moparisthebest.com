    <title>Unable to play offline. 3.2 &amp; 4.1</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unable-to-play-offline-3-2-4-1/361772</link>
    <description>Hi. I really want to play Moparscape 3.2 just to remind myself of the old days.. the old graphics. I enjoyed playing 3.2 back when I had Win XP. It worked perfectly on there.

Yesterday I redownloaded 3.2. I have Win Vista SP2 32-bit. I opened Mopar and clicked &quot;Start Server&quot;. I then entered my username and password. I got this error:

[code]Your account is already logged in.
Try again right now, or make another username[/code]

[code][11:33:32] Logging into (please2, *****)
[11:33:32] Your UID is: 98093268
Server: ClientHandler: Accepted from 127.0.0.1:50198
Did not save for please2
Server: ClientHandler: Client please2 disconnected.
[11:33:46] Couldn&#39;t open output stream to log file please2-20100925.log

[/code]

I keep making usernames.. random usernames. Still the same error. I tried changing the port from 43594 to something random (ie 5555) but still the same error. What seems to be prevalent is the &quot;[b]Couldn&#39;t open output stream to log file[/b]&quot; error.

I thought maybe it&#39;s my firewall fucking it up. So I completely uninstalled my firewall and disabled my anti-virus. Guess what? same problem. Then I restarted my computer and unplugged my internet. Unable to login. I also tried to run the batch file as admin, but the same problem still.

This also happens with the web client.

I tried to download some other servers but still the same problem.


EDIT: [size=24pt]NEVERMIND. TURNED USER ACCOUNT CONTROL OFF AND THAT SHIT WORKED JUST FINE. FUCKING VISTA[/size]

Any help is greatly appreciated.</description>
