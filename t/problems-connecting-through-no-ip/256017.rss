    <title>Problems connecting through no-ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-connecting-through-no-ip/256017</link>
    <description>I have followed many tutorials and it appears I have done everything correct. 

My problem is that it doesn&#39;t seem to want to connect to my No-ip address. I can play under 127.0.0.1 but not under my no-ip. (Note: That I have run a server before on this same computer, but it was about 1 year ago.)

When trying to connect to my server under the no-ip I get the basic error message.

[ul][b]What I have done:[/b]

[list][li] Ports are open

[li] Correct Classpath and Path
[img]http://www.freewebs.com/giggles-psobb/classpath.PNG[/img][/li]

[li] Correct Ip under client[/li]
[li] No-ip running[/li]
[li] Allowed my router to allow other ip address&#39;s to pass through[/li]
[li] Firewalls off[/li]
[li] Tested under 3 different computers[/li]
[/list]

[b]Edit: More Info[/b]
My OS is Windows Xp, and I use SP2

I&#39;d appreciate help! Thank You![/ul]</description>

<p>I don’t think your computer can connect to No-IP just other people. But I don’t no, that is just how it is for me.</p>
