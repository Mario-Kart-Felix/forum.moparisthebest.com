    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-help-connecting-please-its-basically-ignorance/312207</link>
    <description>I know this may not make sense to many..
but i am used to coding the dinosaur moparscape servers
like pimpscape
and cheesescape
im looking to move onto 317
but im confused
i&#39;ve looked all around, search button,
and it seems like its just common knowledge and ive missed it
How do you connect yourself through a 317
like i have downloaded peoples sources + client
but i&#39;m confused past there.
Like is there a webclient i can just put my ip in and connect like the old?
or is there a client i have to make for myself?
Like i said im sorry if this is just basic knowledge and a wasite of a post
but i can&#39;t find it anywhere
basicaly my main question is
if i have a 317 source and im ready to code it
how the heck do i connect to it?
Thanks</description>

              <p>So i just make sure that any ip that appears is the 127.0.0 or whatever?<br>
becuase if so i should just be able to download any<br>
old client and source<br>
and just use vista’s search to find it easy.</p>
