    <title>What are you looking for in a server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-are-you-looking-for-in-a-server/478453</link>
    <description>I&#39;d just like to see what you all would like to see in a server. Please try to keep the content below the graphics update in RS (498 I think?). Why do I want to know this? Because I would like to take ideas from the community and build off of them. Remember, only post your ideas/thoughts/opinions if you would like me to build off of them, don&#39;t post them and then later say &#39;you stole my idea&#39;. Thanks.</description>

<p>What? Why? That would be irregular, not custom really. People do enjoy custom content, but they still enjoy the old content that they had when it comes to the skills themselves, because they are used to it already.</p>

<p>I can insure you that quests and minigames (custom) will be added into the server. I’m not sure about skills though. Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
