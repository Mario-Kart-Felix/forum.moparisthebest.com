    <title>508 Source!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-source/322028</link>
    <description>Can someone please post a good 508 blank source, and yes I&#39;ve checked in the server downloads. All I saw, were links that were broken and sucky 508 sources that were not blank. Please help me out ASAP. One more thing. I tried Palidino76&#39;s blank 508, but when I didn&#39;t even add anything and compiled the source, it gave me symbol errors. I mean wtf is up with that. So anybody that is a better coder than me(that would be everyone), could you please post a good, blank, 508 source. Thank you. I greatly appreciate it.

Sincerely,
Stoneboyjosh</description>
