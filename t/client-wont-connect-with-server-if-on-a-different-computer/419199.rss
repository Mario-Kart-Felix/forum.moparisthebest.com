    <title>Client wont connect with Server if on a different computer</title>

    <description>Hey guys, my private server works when im using it on my own computer.  But, when i transferred the files to my other computer it doesn&#39;t work.  The client loads up, but when i try to log on it says &quot; Error Connecting to Server&quot;. im pretty sure it is because of the client.java file since i changed some things in it.  It would be cool if u guys can help me.  Im willing to do TeamViewer if you are not busy.</description>
