    <description>Hello everybody,

First of all I will introduce myself, I am Bas, I am 16 years old and I live in Holland. I have my own webdesign company in Holland, with over 20 customers a month xd.
I have a lot of experience coding websites and programs. I am not that experienced in Java, but im learning pretty quick.

So, my first project on MoparScape: SecondScape 508.
It will be a server that isnt like Buy your full dragon in the dragon shop, and ckicl the attack button to get 99 attack, no, it&#39;s going to be just like real RS. You can buy the basic stuff in the shops, and the rest will be dropped by the npc&#39;s. Also I&#39;m working really hard to get over 50% of all the RuneScape monsters, including all the dungeons, like the Hill Giant dungeon, and the dungeons beneath the wilderness. When I release this source, almost 90% of all the npc&#39;s have been added.
Also I will make as much Quests as possible.

First I will finish this &#39;base&#39;, then I will release a beta version that everybody can play, next I will fix the bugs.
After that the server stays online untill the server is done, so everybody can see the proggress in real-time.

So, just to start, here some screenshots:

Real shops, with AUTO-UPDATING prices right from the RuneScape Database


So, I will post more pictures soon, and I will bring up the beta version online in, lets say 1 week

Thanks for reading,
