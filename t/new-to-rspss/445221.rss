    <title>New To RSPS&#39;s</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-to-rspss/445221</link>
    <description>Hello Guys,

I&#39;ve been playing Runescape for almost 9 years and recently started RSPS&#39;s as to be honest they&#39;re more enjoyable. I&#39;ve been offered a position to run a private server with a friend but I have literally no experience at all, so I was wondering how long does it take on average to learn java programming; To be able to learn brief knowledge such as how to add shops, NPC&#39;s, Fix bugs/glitches and so on.

I&#39;d also like some advice/help from users who have ran their own RSPS on what documents is best for me to read time and any other tips which are useful.

Regards
- Deci</description>

              <p>I’m more of a website developer, but I’ve started learning Java recently. I suggest using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this.</a> Just follow all of the tutorials and do what it tells you to do, by the end of that, you’ll have a great knowledge and understanding of Java, not just in Private Servers, but Java in general.</p>
