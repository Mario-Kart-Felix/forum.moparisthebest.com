    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-player-following/545897</link>
    <description>I follwed this [url=http://www.runekingdom.smffy.com/index.php?topic=393.0]tutorial[/url] for my player following clipping and everything worked fine for me except one thing.. If a player follows the another and after that try to move (the another player) it auto gets back behind the first one (the followed one) and just can&#39;t move, even if I press on &#39;map&#39; try to move the player its automically go back to the followed player and stand there..

what should I do? If you want I can show you my classes..</description>
