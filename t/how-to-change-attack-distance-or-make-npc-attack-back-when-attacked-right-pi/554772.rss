    <description>hi

im havng issues with attacking npcs on my server

if the npc walks away after being clicked my player stops and waits until they walk back within a good distance to attack.

how can i change it so my player will chase the npc or attack further or something?

do i change this? in npchandler?

Code:

[code]public void attacknpc(int i) {
		if(npcs[i] != null) {
			if (npcs[i].isDead)
				return;
			if (!npcs[i].inMulti() &amp;&amp; npcs[i].underAttackBy &gt; 0) {
				npcs[i].killerId = 0;
				return;
			}[/code]

and add this or am i completely wrong? lol

[code]followNpc();[/code]

note it does follow the npc sometimes not always</description>

<p>im actually also having trouble setting the mysql stuff up right with my site if you could maybe help with that?</p>
<p>or do i need to change the scripts?</p>
<p>if not maybe you could suggest something instead of this source for me to use that is both easy for beginners and full of content with newer gameframe similar to aggroth thanks</p>

I don’t have a quick fix, never cared to look into the issue personally.<br>
Also: I only did minor fixes to aggroth. I’m not the creator.</p>

              <p>I personally don’t know how you’d resolve the issue without using some rather “hacked” methods.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it happens because of this:<br>
[Normal scenario]<br>
You, the client, click an NPC at X, Y, Z<br>
You happen to be standing 5 tiles away, so the <span class="bbcode-u">client</span> walks you to the X, Y, Z (X or Y +/- 1 depending on pos) of the NPC, and stops.<br>
At the same time, the server is waiting for your player to hit a 1-tile range of the npc’s coods to do anything. Once you do it fires the event (Packet is received on initial click - starting the wait process). The event being talking/attacking/shopping/whatever.</p>
<p>[Your issue]<br>
You, the client, click an NPC at X, Y, Z<br>
You, being 5 tiles away, have to wait for the player to walk to the tile (Client sided). But at this time, the NPC walks 2 tiles from its position (Server sided).<br>
So now, the server is waiting on you to finish the walking event and get into 1 tile radius of the NPC’s <span class="bbcode-b">current</span> coords. But, you won’t be in a 1 tile radius as your client sent you to (and stopped you) where the npc was before, not where it is now.</p>
<p>I could only think to solve this by adding some exception in the event that checks your click distance on npcs (Server sided) that if the player has clicked an npc, and the npc is a couple tiles away, the server attempts to force walk towards it.<br>
Reason this is hard to solve, properly, is because walking is handled client sided. So, you could probably add something to the existing walk methods there, but I’m not sure.</p>
