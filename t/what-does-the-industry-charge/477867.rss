    <title>What does the &#39;industry&#39; charge?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-does-the-industry-charge/477867</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using the term industry very openly.
As few of you may know, I work on a website for a guy that really doesn&#39;t know much about websites, he also seems to pay handsomely for it. :P
But I don&#39;t want to be charging too low (ripping myself off) and I don&#39;t want to charge to high (ripping him off).
So, I&#39;d like to know, what do you guys typically charge for web services and such. I listed a few things I&#39;m doing for him currently below.

[ul][li]Writhing HTML/CSS (normal)[/li]
[li]Re-Writing the entire website (30+ pages HTML, and some other pages I have yet to see)[/li]
[li]Working on a wordpress site (Honestly, I have no clue how to do this, help would be lovely)[/li]
[li]And more[/li][/ul]

What is a good rate/fee I could charge?</description>

<p>Thanks for strengthening my point. You’re probably right though, he’s probably just a nice friendly interwebber who doesn’t have very many Internets.</p>

 The Web Guy:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re in luck, I’m 15, still in school, but I’ve done web design (for others) for four years. It depends the business, if it’s a small, local restaurant, who is just starting out, I wouldn’t charge much. If it’s a bigger corporation, I’ll charge a bit more.  With what you’ve said, and not knowing who you’re doing it for other than some guy, I would recommend about $170-$190, 30+ pages re-written is quite a bit. I wouldn’t go less than $150, however, he may try to offer less because you’re still in school, that’s what people usually try to do to me.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>He tends to compliment me, a lot xD (it sometimes is offensive, but he means good.). So I don’t think him undercharging me is an issue, considering I’m setting the rate, as he asks me how much to send, I try not sounding like an ass when I ask for the money (it’s always been awkward for me to ask) and I work on it during/before/after he sends the money. Of course, the code isn’t put online till I receive payment.<br>
Plus, it’s definitley worth $150 imo because, well, if he has me re-write 30+ html pages that all use horrid nasty code, and make it work to w3’s standards. I think I’m in good shape.</p>

<p>It depends on the skill level involved, when I freelance I charge between 7 and 10 dollars for a page using just HTML and CSS. If they wish a script to be used, they can then purchase the script which I’ll incorporate. If the site is over 15 pages its 7$ per page. If its under 15 pages its 10$ per page. I don’t really freelance much since I’m rolling in cash from work but that’s what I used to do. It keeps you living comfortably. Once you get a name for yourself then you’re gonna have business left right and centre and could quite easily be charging roughly 150 per simple site and if you do 4 of those a week you’re coming off at 600 dollars. It’s just finding the right kind of people to pay those amounts. Usually small businesses that are just starting. Try handing out some form of leaflets or flyers to local shops and asking if they can put them in the windows or what not. Freelancing is what you make of it, if you want a lot of money then expand into advertisements. Once you make your name heard the money will make itself.</p>

              <p>It depends on the skill level involved, when I freelance I charge between 7 and 10 dollars for a page using just HTML and CSS. If they wish a script to be used, they can then purchase the script which I’ll incorporate. If the site is over 15 pages its 7$ per page. If its under 15 pages its 10$ per page. I don’t really freelance much since I’m rolling in cash from work but that’s what I used to do. It keeps you living comfortably. Once you get a name for yourself then you’re gonna have business left right and centre and could quite easily be charging roughly 150 per simple site and if you do 4 of those a week you’re coming off at 600 dollars. It’s just finding the right kind of people to pay those amounts. Usually small businesses that are just starting. Try handing out some form of leaflets or flyers to local shops and asking if they can put them in the windows or what not. Freelancing is what you make of it, if you want a lot of money then expand into advertisements. Once you make your name heard the money will make itself.</p>

<p>So this guy was a substitute at my CTS (Career and Technical School) and wanted someone that knew how to work with web design. My class pointed to me, and I agreed. He had me write a simple php date(); function, and paid me $20 just for that.<br>
Just today, he paid me $40 for re-writing his index.html.<br>
That’s really, all I’ve gotten accomplished, aside from editing 1 image.</p>

<p>Charge according to work completed and time invested. Professionals can make $30,000 - 70,000 as a yearly salary, if working for a big company. You can also be paid more if you have invested into your education. Otherwise, you can charge upon completion (which I don’t recommend), as you can be taken advantage of in these specific circumstances. You can always withhold content if there’s a failure to make payment. It’s honestly better if you freelance and work on specific problems, because you can earn a lot of cash for 1 hour of work easily.</p>

<p>I guess that’s what I’m doing, in a sense.<br>
I’m not fully hired, but I agreed I’d work on the website for payment.</p>

              <p>I’m using the term industry very openly.<br>
As few of you may know, I work on a website for a guy that really doesn’t know much about websites, he also seems to pay handsomely for it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
But I don’t want to be charging too low (ripping myself off) and I don’t want to charge to high (ripping him off).<br>
So, I’d like to know, what do you guys typically charge for web services and such. I listed a few things I’m doing for him currently below.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Writhing HTML/CSS (normal)[/li]<br>
[li]Re-Writing the entire website (30+ pages HTML, and some other pages I have yet to see)[/li]<br>
[li]Working on a wordpress site (Honestly, I have no clue how to do this, help would be lovely)[/li]<br>
[li]And more[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>What is a good rate/fee I could charge?</p>
