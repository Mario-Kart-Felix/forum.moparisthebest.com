    <title>Can&#39;t Connect to the Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-the-server/453966</link>
    <description>Well... It&#39;s weird.

I have port forwarded (Verified the port is open) and for some reason when I run the server it says it is up. I have changed and compiled the client&#39;s IP to 127.0.0.1 and even tried using my own IP and my no-ip redirect/host. It still won&#39;t connect to it.

Any ideas?</description>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/pray">@pray</a> your completely wrong dude don’t comment unless you know for sure because when people like you comment it just makes it hard for the person to get there problem fixed. I’m sorry to call you out like that but come on dude you should have a one hundred percent answer I’m sorry like i said but your a complete dumb ass.</p>
<p>okay for you to connect you need to have your client ip to 0.0.0.0 or to 127.0.0.1 which ever you prefer then save it complie it then lets go into your source. click run on the source this will till the client to go online and let people connect. and it will also let you connect. Now for others to be able to connect to you, you need to have your no-ip downloaded client open and change the client ip to your no-ip address  save it compile it then zip it upload it somewhere. Then change it back to 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 which ever you choose then save it compile and your ready to host. now you need to keep the no-ip client which is called duc 3.0 open at all times! because it’s your ip address.<br>
