    <title>New Rule! [Updated Sept.]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-rule-updated-sept/38448</link>
    <description>Ok, I&#39;ve noticed a lot of site advertisement, rather than &#39;Rate some work that [b]I, myself,[/b] have done.  

This is unacceptable: 
Uploading a template, changing a little bit of text, mild defacing of a pre-made template.

This is acceptable:
Creating a website from scratch, creating or innovating website components and code.

I mean, think about it?  You really think most of us are stupid enough to watch you pass on your shit?  I know an advertisement from a &#39;Please rate a site I didn&#39;t make.&#39;

Thanks.
