    <description>okay i figured out how to make items only weildable by staff. how would i make it where if non staff tried wearing it, they would get banned? 

this is my code

[code]
        if (ItemID == 773 &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 1) {
                    PlayerHandler.messageToAll = (playerName
                            + &quot; IS TRYING TO WEAR P RING BAN HIM!!&quot;);
	    return 1000;
	}[/code]

now how would i get it to where it bans cause they tried wearing it if they non staff?</description>

              <p>that seems kinda harsh to bann that would make people quit just make it remove the item and poison the player i did thatâ€¦</p>
<p><code>        if (playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 773 &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 1) {
        {
            remove(playerEquipment[playerWeapon], 3);
            sendMessage("Nice try, This is only for staff. ;]");
            PoisonPlayer();
        }</code></p>
