    <description>I&#39;ve been running a server pretty well but then out of nowhere I came across a problem, after you kill an NPC maybe 7 times? it stops respawning and me and 2 others have looked into it and we can&#39;t see anything wrong, it happens to almost every NPC, anyone got any tips?</description>
