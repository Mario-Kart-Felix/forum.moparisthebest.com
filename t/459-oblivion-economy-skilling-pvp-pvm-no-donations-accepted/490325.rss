    <description>[u][b]The goal of the server:[/b][/u]
The goal of this server is to provide the players authentic gametime, with little modifications to how the real game was.

[u][b]About the server:[/b][/u]
The server is a 459 revision, which was released in July of 2007, meaning that there was the Godwars Dungeon. 459 was before the Grand Exchange update aswell. We chose to go without the Grand Exchange as it really removed interaction between the players and also manipulated the economy.

[u][b]Why compete with 2007 Scape?:[/b][/u]
Well I wasn&#39;t aware that I would have to compete with 2007 Scape because I started working on this server about two weeks before the poll came to RuneScape. Even though 2007 Scape is coming I still want to continue my project.

[u][b]What makes your server different from all the other servers / 2007 scape?:[/b][/u]
Differences from other private servers:

[ul][li]Mature admins that won&#39;t tolerate botters, gamblers, real world traders, or abusive staff/players.[/li]
[li]No donations accepted- so there won&#39;t be items/xp sold.[/li]
[li]No items/xp given for voting. You vote to help get more players playing the server.[/li]
[li]Dedicated hosting: i7 processor; 16/32gb ram; 100mbit; &amp; 1gbit line.[/li]
[li]A professional coder &amp; a fully customized source from bottom up.[/li]
[li]All original stats, npcs, bosses, graphics.[/li]
[li]Staff members that will listen to your suggestions.[/li]
[li]XP will actually be worth something. All xp will be aimed at a 10x rate compared to other servers which have it at upwards of 150x. Skillers will enjoy this feature and players will have something to show off.[/li]
[li]All skills working.[/li]
[li]An organized forum that is heavily moderated to filter out junk posts and ban annoyances.[/li][/ul]




Differences from 2007 scape:

[ul][li]Godwars Dungeon.[/li]
[li]Developers that listen to the community.[/li]
[li]Free to play, and no micro transactions.[/li]
[li]Faster XP gains, but still makes getting 99 in a skill an achievement.[/li]
[li]We will ban all bots/real world traders/gamblers on spot.[/li]
[li]We wont ever try to force an update that the community doesn&#39;t like.[/li]
[li]No grinding.[/li]
[li]A stable economy.[/li][/ul]


[u][b]Questions/Answers:[/b][/u]

[ul][li]&quot;How will you afford to keep the server up?&quot; - Simple, I have a job and I&#39;m willing to fund this project.[/li]
[li]&quot;When will this server be released?&quot; - When the developer has developed the server.[/li]
[li]&quot;Why is it taking so long for you to release the server?&quot; - The developer is writing all the skills, systems, and etc from scratch instead of copy/pasting them from other servers.[/li]
[li]&quot;I can&#39;t wait any longer to play the server&quot; - Check back in regularly because we will have beta tests to find bugs and fix them. Also to give people a feel.[/li]
[li]&quot;Will our accounts from beta be transferred when the final version gets released?&quot; - No, because if there were any bugs/glitches that allowed people to get items/xp then that would be be an unfair advantage.[/li]
[li]&quot;I want to help you guys, how can I do that?&quot; - Keep up with the latest posts on the forum and we will be asking people for ideas/suggestions/feedback. Also, you can vote daily to help get the word out about the server.[/li]
[li]&quot;You are wasting your time, the server will be taken down just like 2006scape&quot; - No, we have taken the necessary precautions to help prevent from that sort of thing happening. If our hosting goes down we will simply just purchase new hosting and upload the backups.[/li][/ul]

<p>I don’t have the 2006 forums dump. And if I did I would need time to go through it and make sure there are no vulnerabilities (because if it got leaked , that means that there was a vulnerability). But if that was what the players wanted and I could find the dump I would use it.</p>
