    <title>Cant log onto my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-log-onto-my-server/446873</link>
    <description>I am trying to run a varrockscape server at the moment, I havent modified it or anything, just trying to logon, but i cant. On the server prompt it shows me trying to log on, then it says logged out a second later. I tried to run a server with a different base before, and I had a similar problem, except it just said something like Client null disconnected instead. I&#39;ve searched the forums for that error, except nothing I have found helps me solve my problem.</description>
