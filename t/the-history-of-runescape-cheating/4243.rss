<blockquote>THE HISTORY OF RUNESCAPE CHEATING
by Rockrook
<p>CHAPTER ONE</p>
<p>Throughout the history of any game, the initial pleasure and excitement normally wear off after a certain amount of time.  So ensues the most notorious form of online crookery; cheating.  There are two desires in a game; getting and having.  Having is a desire that never wears off.  Getting is a desire that, after a while, starts to get old for some people.  Thus they begin to search for ways to have without having to get.  In this way, a game begins to encounter the first of its player-created problems.<br>
Runescape is certainly no exception to the rules.  Very early on, players looked for ways to get around the slow process of leveling up and, more inviting to the general population, gaining wealth and possessions.  Scamming is certainly the oldest and most popular form of cheating; trading possessions or services in a way in which one player, the scammer, has an obvious advantage.  Normally this involves tricking a player who has less knowledge of what is happening; in the language of leet, or Internet slang, a â€œnoobâ€.  It is important to establish the very fine line between scamming and a popular money-making practice in Runescape, flipping notes, which involves buying items for low prices and selling them for a higher price.  This is a difficult practice that requires knowledge of current prices and how and where to buy and sell.  Normally, buying anything for less than half of its current price or selling anything for more than fifty percent higher than its current price is considered scamming.  While scamming usually falls under the category of tricking players into buying or selling for unreasonable prices, it can also be used to define removing items from a trade screen without the other player knowing, which is fairly difficult to pull off, or stealing an item from a player who is only â€œlendingâ€ it.<br>
As early players began to use various forms of scams to gain wealth or items without working for them, several players emerged as more â€œadvancedâ€ cheaters and began to explore new methods of cheating.  This involved more complicated forms of cheating, such as writing programs or attempting to get to Runescapeâ€™s own source code.  However, Andrew (the gameâ€™s creator) anticipated this and has protected against it very well over the years.  There have only been several instances over the five years the game has been around that problems relating to the gameâ€™s code have occurred.<br>
Later I will explore the successful programs and hackers that have marred the history of Runescape.  I will also describe the various methods and schemes that players have employed over the years in their mostly futile attempts to break the game and strike it rich.</p>
<p>CHAPTER TWO</p>
<p>The art of scamming has survived longer than perhaps of all of the other practices of Runescape.  Scammers have been around since the early spring of the year 2001, and yet they still thrive in the modern age.  Some have been at large ever since the beginning, but most of the original gods of the art are waiting out eternity in the Black Hole, otherwise known as Runescape hell.<br>
When Runescape was founded, there was no Tip.it or price guides, and when players first entered the new world, they had little knowledge of current market prices.  Some of the more experienced players who knew the prices (most of the early price experts had helped set them; most of the original trade prices were above shop prices and gradually evolved to a supply-and-demand balance) saw an opportunity to take advantage of the new players.  Usually, however, profits were scarce, seeing that noobs rarely had much to take.  However, once in a great while a scammer would find a player who had little selling experience but a lot to sell, and would strike gold.<br>
Many times, mostly in the early days when prices were constantly fluctuate and no one knew exactly how much to spend or sell for, players that ranked high in the Runescape community would trick players into believing that a price had gone down or up, which worked on most players, event the experienced ones.  Sometimes these even mutated into massive hoaxes.  The most famous of these was the Disk-Bulb, which happened in mid-May of 2005.  Several players started a rumor that a very rich player who owned over a hundred Disks of Returning, a â€œsmall rareâ€, had quit Runescape, along with his disks.  The price of disks shot up over five million coins from the beginning of the year to that May before it was finally realized that the whole thing was fake.  The first large-scale price manipulation occurred in August of 2004, in which party hats went up several million coins.  Two other large manipulations, around New Yearâ€™s in 2005 and in June of 2005, spiked party hat prices from five to ten million coins and up to fifteen million coins, respectively.<br>
By definition, scamming is obtaining money or items from another player in exchange for either an amount of money or items that does not match the value of the obtained money or items, or in exchange for nothing at all.  Many players do not know that scamming goes hand-in-hand with hacking, which presents another age-old method of Runescape cheating.<br>
Where playing fairly is flat land, money and item scamming is rolling hills, the method of hacking is a vast mountain.  Instead of scamming a player for several items or some of their money, many players began to cheat in a way that they were able to take all of a playerâ€™s items and all of their money.  In fact, they are even able to take their character.<br>
Hacking is logging into another playerâ€™s account.  This is done in either of two ways: obtaining their password in the game from them, which is a scam, or using a trojan virus, which is put in a download, to steal their password in a more tech-savvy way.  Normally, hackers operate in-game, using many different ways to get players to say their password.  For example, a hacker might say to a player, â€œDid you know that Jagex doesnâ€™t let you say your password?  Look: ******â€.  The stars are obviously manually typed, and Jagex does allow players to say their password (for the obvious reason that some passwords are everyday objects).<br>
In this way and many others, hackers obtain a playerâ€™s password, proceeding to add the player to their friend list so they know when the player logs out.  The hacker then logs out and logs in to the other playerâ€™s account.  Recently, hacking has become more difficult, as Jagex has introduced optional Bank PIN numbers, which allows players to set a four-digit password that must be entered to enter a playerâ€™s bank when the bank is first accessed after each login.  However, many players still do not have a PIN.  Some of these players have not set a PIN because they are naÃ¯ve about account safety, and these are normally the ones who are hacked the most.<br>
Although most players who present a weak defense to hacking are noobs who donâ€™t have much to offer, obtaining an account can be valuable in other ways.  For example, a noob account may have a friend who shares their password with the noob.  A hacker may be able to obtain the friendâ€™s password in this way, and hack into the friendâ€™s account.  In this way, hackers are able to form a network of accounts that stem from just one, and in some cases are able to work their way up to better and better accounts.  Not every experienced player in Runescape is able to keep from being hacked.  Any player who gives out their password, even to a close friend, is at risk.  For example, one of Runescapeâ€™s top cheaters and most experienced players in hacking of all time was hacked himself, through a keylogged client, Evil Cowgod (read more about him in Chapter 4).<br>
Still, more advanced hackers actually create perfect copies of the Runescape website, with a different suffix.  For instance, <a href="http://Runescape.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Runescape.net</a>, <a href="http://runescape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.org</a>, and <a href="http://runescape.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.co.uk</a> are all copies of the Runescape page.  Hackers use these sites to trick people into entering their password, although success does not come often, as most players have the genuine Runescape website bookmarked or favorited and donâ€™t ever come across these sites.<br>
So scammers steal possessions and hackers steal accounts.  Then we must move to the third level of Runescape crookery.  The most famous and productive type of Runescape cheating lies not in the game or in the wealth and naivety of other players; it lies beyond these conquered frontiers.  It lies in the deep and unknown stretches of source code.</p>
<p>CHAPTER THREE</p>
<p>Soon after the arts of scamming and hacking had been mastered, a race of players began looking for more.  Why should they be limited to what other players have, when the game itself holds so much more?  And so began a new generation of Runescape cheaters.<br>
While code cheating is referred to as level three, the first two levels are actually grouped together; both involve taking from other players.  Code cheating is the process of taking items from the world of Runescape that have yet to be acquired (an exception to this is autotrading programs, complicated macros which have the ability to buy and sell items).<br>
Jagex was vastly unprepared for the first wave of macroers.  As these players began to explore the possibility of writing macros to automatically perform tasks (mining, woodcutting, etc) they found that Jagex had done virtually nothing to protect against this.  Among the lacking features that currently exist was a useful feature that causes the screen to shift around.  Without this, writing programs for Runescape was extremely easy.  The most popular macro of the early days was the famous Ghost Mouse macro.  It became very well known for its ease of use and simple efficiency.<br>
When the update finally came on March 21st, 2001, GM was rendered almost useless and avid macroers were forced to change their ways.  The only successful macro of this time was an autominer created by Pirax.  However, another update came out soon after that moved the screen slowly and even Piraxâ€™s autominer slid into oblivion.  For a while, cheating was reduced to scamming, and little to no progress was made in code cheating.<br>
But every valley has a hill, and soon code cheating was recovering.  The ground began to rise when a forum poster called Utopia Devil put a Runescape client on <a href="http://utopiadevil.com" rel="nofollow noopener">utopiadevil.com</a> and encouraged players to visit the site and download the new program.  Players who visited found a new macro by the name of RuneBot.<br>
RuneBot was by far the most successful macro up to this point.  It had many features: automining, autofishing, and autos for many more skills; bank runs (the first macro to include this feature), speed magic casting, zoom, different screen size, and a bypass of the language filter.  Its best feature were the macros, which were easily recorded by the user.  RuneBot was released in February 2002 and had immediate success and extreme popularity.  Utopia Devilâ€™s actual name was Vee; Devil was simply his forum name.<br>
All things come to an end, though, and soon Jagex began to go after the users of RuneBot.  300 players were banned for using the software and, without updates, RuneBot slowly began to decline and, after a while, was virtually useless.<br>
As more and more people began playing Runescape in 2002, more players with programming experience leeched onto the idea of altering game code.  A player by the name of Phlat was king of the forums during these days, usually RBcheats forums.  He created software that was supposed to allow a player to change the amount of money in his bank.  The program didnâ€™t have a major effect, as Phlat could only find success about one percent of the time, although several other players also were able to use it, making close to a million coins.<br>
The biggest player in these times was The Nick Dude, who did work on the first color recognition macro.  Nickâ€™s main project was Autominer, which was, of course, the first color recognition autominer.  Autominer came out on October 1st, 2002, and was by far the most important development of this era.  Hundreds of people used this autominer and, in some ways, it prevented the decline or extinction of avid cheaters in the future.  Autominer was an extremely legitimate macro that was the first major step since RuneBot.  The only other significant macro made in those days was AlexAutoMiner, created by Alex, who was also famous for his leadership of the Golden Helms clan.<br>
Even Autominer, however, didnâ€™t last forever.  After months of success and glory, Nick began to let his key to success slip away: the updates.  As the macro was updated less and less, Jagex got closer and closer to catching it.  Eventually, Autominer suffered an ironic death; Nickâ€™s father, concerned about the cheating his son was doing, even though it was online, shut the project down.  As Nick disappeared from Runescape with a glorious exit, having been arguably the top code cheater in Runescape history, Runescape cheaters looked to the future with anxiety and excitement, not knowing what would come next.</p>
<p>CHAPTER FOUR</p>
<p>While The Nick Dude awed the Runescape world with his ground-breaking autominer, something was brewing in the basement of the player who did know  that in several years, he would have the title of the greatest cheater in the history of Runescape.  The roots of the project began in September 2001 and, after a year on the shelf, year-old ideas were dusted off, polished, and broken back in.  Soon the magic started to flow.<br>
Kaitnieks was his name.  He first entered the RBcheats forum in September of 2002, and on September 22nd of that year he began to talk with another one of Runescapeâ€™s best cheaters, Evil Cowgod, who created a community of cheaters that corresponded with each other.  Without him, Kaitâ€™s ideas would still be on the shelf collecting dust.<br>
The first version was shared by Kait with Cow and Alex, as well as two other testers, Vincent and Heppu.  The interface was created by Rapids.  At first, Cow, who had become extremely skeptical of Kaitâ€™s plans, was amazed, along with the other testers.  Alex, who had investigated cheating his entirely life, is credited with the quote, â€œOh my god, itâ€™s so fastâ€.<br>
AutoRune was sold for the first time on September 20, 2002, to Olee.  At first, few players knew about AR and sales were low, but this kept the program from becoming too widespread and the original users enjoyed huge success without the risk of being banned.<br>
AutoRune had many features, the most important being that it was the first scriptable macro.  A complex macro that had dozens of steps could be written very easily and carried out without a hitch.  The bank run feature was hailed by users.  AR could also steal arrows from archers who failed to retrieve them, find and bury bones, and collect feathers.  Even stupid little macros, such as repeated public messages, could be carried out easily when AR users needed a break from work.<br>
One of the more amusing aspects of AutoRune was a very famous event that took place in November 2002.  The famed Banker Slayings took place in Varrock, when Kait and some fellow users made new accounts and used AR to be able to kill bankers, which was easily done with the program.  The noobs fought the bankers using melee and ranged attacks for an hour or so, and were then caught and banned by Mod Bennet.<br>
The entire project was sold to Coran on November 1, 2002, but after he took over on December 5, 2002, Kait decided to stay on board and help out.  Little did Coran know, he had wasted hundreds of dollars purchasing AR, not being able to foresee what would happen eight days later.<br>
Black Friday came in Runescape on December 13, 2002.  For the first time, Jagex employees got personally involved in a macro, realizing that this was a whole new kind of animal and needed to be dealt with differently.  The easy edit to the code detected all AR users when they mined, and soon the vast majority of AR users were banned.  All activity on the forums was gone, and the community of Runescape cheaters has perhaps never seen a darker time.<br>
There was a spark in Kaitnieks that made him unlike any other player.  He had the ability to get slapped in the face, turn around, and concuss his opponent.  But before Kaitâ€™s nerves of steel were revealed, something had to trip the trap, and that something happened in April of 2003.  Evil Cowgod, after the forums ran dry for nearly four months, made his return.  Cow changed web hosters, hoping to find one who would keep his site up despite Jagexâ€™s encouragement to hosts to take it down.  Cow found the host, LucidPC, and founded Bovine Labs, taking the forum from <a href="http://evilcowgod.com" rel="nofollow noopener">evilcowgod.com</a> to <a href="http://bovinelabs.com" rel="nofollow noopener">bovinelabs.com</a>.<br>
Soon AutoRune was back, and suddenly its popularity exploded.  To cap it all off, Vee came back with a new, working version of RuneBot.  This was, as many players see it, the glory days of macros, as the only two supercheats were in their prime.  AR 2.3 was released on April 9th, 2003.<br>
But as cheats go, soon Jagex caught up, this time altering the way Runescape itself communicates to the server.  Interestingly, no one was banned, probably because there were hordes of people using these programs and Jagex had been worn down by all of the patrol duty that had to do to keep up with Kait and Cow.  RuneBot got a little less lucky, lasting only a week before taken down.<br>
But you canâ€™t just say no to guys like Kaitnieks and Evil Cowgod.  As always, they found a way around the new update, and soon AutoRune was back up and running.  However, Kait wisely kept the return secret to keep AR going as long as possible.  Even more wisely, he created another cheat, SCAR (Shi* Compared to AutoRune), to distract the novice cheaters on the forums and keep them from inquiring about a possible return of AutoRune.  AR was up and going stronger than ever in its third life.<br>
AutoRune had finally found its target audience.  The ARC (AutoRune Crew) were the only players allowed to use AR, and were a group of programmers and scripters.  With a constant exchange of information and ideas, along with a level of secrecy that kept AR alive for a very long time, the macro had finally hit its own glory days.<br>
And so we reach the pinnacle of Runescape cheating.  We come to arguably the most historic event in the history of the game, one that, two-and-a-half years later, ninety percent of the Runescape population knows about.<br>
It was November 6, 2003, and Kaitnieks updated AutoRune to include a new autotrader.  Little did he know what the result of this minor and little-thought-of addition would have on Runescape forever.<br>
So the update came out.  SixFeetUnder, a member of the ARC, discovered a bug in the update while attempting to trade a party hat.  Using the new auto-trader, Six discovered that when you put up an item as a trade and entered its amount as zero, it showed to the other player that one of the item had been put up.  In this way, items could be created from scratch.  This bug also used item IDâ€™s, which are numbers given to each item.  For example, pink party hats (the most popular created item) have an ID of 580, Christmas Crackers are 575, and Rune Two-Handed Swords are 81.<br>
This was called duplicating, or duping, but it was actually creation.  You did not need to have an item to duplicate, you could simply create it using the itemâ€™s ID number in place of another object, and AutoRune (the item had to be non-stackable).  In minutes, billions of coins worth of items could be created.<br>
SixFeetUnder was a very smart Runescape player, and he could understand the power behind this discovery.  The future of Runescapeâ€™s economy literally lay in his hands.  He could keep it to himself or spread the word.  Eventually, however, Six decided to do the most reasonable and expected thing, and reveal the secret only to his closest friends.<br>
Six revealed the bug to Kaitnieks (who revealed it, no doubt, to Evil Cowgod) and four other Crew members: Aid U, David, Dylock, and G0ne.  And now we come to the most famous unsolved crime in Runescape history.<br>
One of those four players leaked the information.  To this day, no one knows who it was except for the person themselves.  The leaker has never revealed him-self and Six, Kait, and Cow still have no idea which one it was.  But the damage had been done, and by the morning of November 7th, 2003, thousands of players had heard the news: duping, every cheaterâ€™s fantasy, was here.<br>
11-7-03 is still an infamous date to this day.  Not everyone had access to this bug, but enough did so that hundreds, or possibly thousands, of party hats were duped.  Most of these were pink party hats, as they were the rarest item in the game at that time (Crackers were actually rarer, but less valuable; however, they were the second most-duped item).  The dupers began to sell the hats, lowering prices in an attempt to be able to sell all that they could dupe.  Most of them sold for around five million coins, a fourth of the hatsâ€™ actual value.  As more and more party hats were duped and more and more Crackers pulled, the value of party hats began to significantly decline over a period of only a few hours.<br>
Some players realized that they could avoid the imminent ban by creating and profiting from less popular items.  Two well-known players created and high-alched many Dragon Square Shields and made over a billion coins each.  Several players created popularly alched items or small rares, hoping to avoid a ban.  But even these players were scarce, and ninety-nine percent of duped items were the party hats.<br>
The economy of Runescape suffered incredibly that day, especially in the rares market.  When Jagex went to fix the bug, they suspiciously didnâ€™t shut down any servers or anything that would be expected; instead, they let it all play out, a move that showed that they were quite interested in helping rares go down in value.  Jagex has never supported the rares market.<br>
Pink party hats saw the steepest decline.  On November 6th, they were valued at twenty million coins and the rarest hat in the game.  On November 8th, they were valued at two hundred thousand coins, a hundred times less than two days before, and the most common hat in the game.<br>
For those who bought pinks when they bottomed out and held onto them in blind faith, they were rewarded.  If they sold a year after the Big Dupe, they would earn about four or five million coins more.  For those who waited two years, they would earn up to thirty-five million coins more.  The current price of pinks (changed to purples during the transition to Runescape 2 ) are currently around seventy million coins.<br>
In the end, a few players profited but the Dupe was a horrible slam to the economy of Runescape.  Few players escaped the ban, and no escaper made over a hundred million coins.  For most players, the Big Dupe meant a big drop in the price of rares, which appealed to many, but as rares are such a huge portion of the economy, Runescape as a whole has never suffered worse.  Pink party hats, in their massive creation, took nearly a year-and-a-half to return to their normal price.  Even items that werenâ€™t duped, such as more common party hats and even some small rares, mostly Santa Hats, dropped in price.  The entire rares market did not get back on its feet for another year, and was not entirely normal until Runescape 2 was released and the prices of all items shot up and then went down again, balancing the items affected by the Big Dupe.<br>
Jagex fixed the bug several hours after the duping began, and they began to ban players.  Jagex tried to delete as many items as they could, but as they could not tell which items had been duped and which had not, they mostly had to give it a good guess.  They got a lot of the items but, as they were afraid to go over the number of items, many were not deleted.<br>
AutoRune survived the dupe and lived on.  More bugs were discovered after the Big Dupe.  The most appealing was a feature not unlike RuneBotâ€™s speed spell-caster, which allowed players to cast spells without runes, and a target was not needed.  AutoRune also allowed its users to attack and kill themselves in the wilderness.  There were also several body graphic bugs.  Women could be given beards and a character could be created without a body, among several other odd little bugs.<br>
AutoRune was taken over soon after by APD, its third owner, who was soon corrupted by the position and, following his old trade of scamming, began to sell AR accounts for gold pieces.  Soon the macro began to spread to the Runescape community and with all of the macroing going on, Kait and Cow finally gave up on the project, as the game had finally started to lose its appeal with the mass popularity.<br>
Another ban came on January 2, 2004, but this time, Kaitnieks didnâ€™t rebound, simply because he didnâ€™t want to.  Bovine Labs died and many Crew members quit Runescape.  In one of APDâ€™s exchanges, some AR code was stolen and soon began to circulate among the remaining Runescape cheaters, including a player named Buckna, who altered the source code and created AsheyRune, which had a short life before it was rendered useless in an update.  Buckna gave up on the project and the Runescape cheating community that had once been a lush valley of ideas and exchanges became a desert scarcely wandered.  Without the legends of cheating there to water the grass, code cheating reached an all-time low.  It appeared that there was no hope for the future of the community, and the code cheating world had effectively died.</p>
<p>CHAPTER FIVE</p>
<p>One word can describe the era after AutoRune was aborted: retirement.  Cheating, like all sports, had its masters.  And the masters, like in all sports, had retired.  Only they all retired at the same time.<br>
Between the time of the mass ban of January 2004 and the release of Runescape 2, cheating virtually did not exist, and even hackers and scammers had begun to decline.  While this was good for Runescape, those few who cared about keeping the underworld of Runescape alive had never seen worse times.<br>
March 29th, 2004, was the date of salvation for Runescape cheaters.  It was then that Runescape 2 was released, and gave the community more than enough fire power to get back into orbit.  The RuneCMS forums were created and dominated the cheating scene for over a year.  New names and clients began to pop up, and finally progress was being made.<br>
The most famous cheater of the â€œRS2 Eraâ€, and also one of the most famous and controversial players of all time, was M.G. (or simply MG)  MG created the legendary website autominer.tk, which eventually switched to <a href="http://autominer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">autominer.org</a>, which eventually was sold by MG.  This was his first project, an incredible auto-miner that soon jumped to the top and became the first great client of the RS2 era.  MG was immediately hailed as the next Kaitnieks, and, in his two-year stunt with Runescape cheating, he certainly â€œdeliveredâ€.<br>
While MG was earning fans and site hits, some of the members of the cheating community aspired to make their name in a different way.  Many players began to attempt to reincarnate AutoRune and RuneBot, riding on the risk that if they were able to resurrect these legends, they would not need to then make a name for themselves.  This was not a new concept, and it certainly isnâ€™t old; still today avid cheaters work towards recovering AR and RB, even years and years after they supposedly â€œdiedâ€.<br>
However, not all of those people were legitimate.  In fact, eighty percent were only using the names made famous by Kait and Cow and Vee to benefit their own wants.  They offered â€œnew versionsâ€ of AutoRune and RuneBot that, most of the time, were simply a trojan download to steal Runescape passwords.  And it wasnâ€™t like the other twenty percent were gods.  Although their intention was not to scam, the vast majority did not have much luck (or skill, for that matter) in the hundreds of futile attempts to bring AR and RB back to life.<br>
Soon, in 2005, a group of Runescape cheaters aspired to create a second major community.  RuneCMS had switched to <a href="http://runecms.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runecms.com</a> but somewhere between May 2005 and the next few months RuneCMS mysteriously disappeared, and all that is left are the archives of old posts and topics.<br>
As RuneCMS began to sink into the mud, a new forum began to rise.  This new project was headquartered at <a href="http://sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">sythe.org</a>, named after Sythe, a member of the now-famous Runescape cheating threesome of Sythe, Jansen, and, very ironically named, Cheater.<br>
<a href="http://Sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Sythe.org</a> hit the web in June 2005 and has been rolling every since.  Following the death of RuneCMS, Sythe has become the premiere Runescape community of cheating on the Internet, and nothing but good lies ahead.<br>
A major part of the last couple years is SCAR.  Shi* Compared to AutoRune, as you know, was created mainly as a decoy by Kaitnieks to keep AutoRune on the DL.  However, we can see the unbelievable genius of Kait as his â€œdecoyâ€ has out-lasted his pet project.  SCAR has evolved into ScarScape, a sub-community for the client.  ScarScape went from the original SCAR scripts to where it is now, with a fairly high rank in Runescape cheating.  Although Kait and Cow shut down the cheating community and quit Runescape long ago, their work lives on and is still hailed as some of the best in modern Runescape cheating.<br>
Sythe, obviously, was the head guru in the Sythe community project.  He has developed quite a few Runescape macros, including the SytheScape project.  He is still going strong today, the biggest name in Runescape cheating.  Sytheâ€™s latest creation is Auto Fighter, an excellent cheat that is part of his collection of famous clients.<br>
Though MG is no longer active, his success didnâ€™t end with autominer.tk.  MG soon embarked on his second project, ending with MGClient (MGC), the most famous cheating program for Runescape 2.  November 28, 2004, was the release date for MGC, and soon RS2 cheating hit a new high.  Although it hasnâ€™t been down since and success is ravaging the RS2 cheating community, MGCâ€™s release marks a high point in Runescape cheating history.  MG had become one of the most famous players in the history of the game, and soon he became enormously powerful, a quality that would reveal the best â€“ and worst â€“ in him.<br>
MG had developed a huge reputation for setting standards and raising them consistently.  He earned a massive amount of respect and the RuneCMS forums were thriving with MG praise.  But soon his power corrupted him and stained his reputation.  To this day, he is remembered more for the things he did that, some say, led to the destruction of the RuneCMS community.<br>
MG, put bluntly, was a scammer.  As people began to put unreasonable trust in him and what he put out, he began to realize the power that he had and how he could use it in so many ways.  When you have the ability to put out programs that people will download without thinking twice, and usually not even once, you have a choice to make: keep going straight and clean, as Kaitnieks and Evil Cowgod did, or pull a Stalin and mess things up, for your benefit alone.<br>
MG chose the latter, and he paid for it, no longer being able to bear the name he truly deserves, as one of Runescapeâ€™s best cheaters.  Instead, he is now one of the most notorious scammers in Runescape history.  He began to put out downloads for players that were fake, and you might as well save time and tell MG your password, as the trojans in these downloads did.  You could easily compare MG to Pete Rose.  He made himself a legendary name and then erased it all because he felt like he needed more.  As Rose did in baseball, MG flip-flopped when it came to the big question: did he scam?  There is no doubt in the world that MG was a practicing scammer, but he didnâ€™t always admit to it.  But MG should still be included in anyoneâ€™s cheating Hall of Fame, because cheating is what he was really doing in the first place, so, out of context, because he would have done something wrong anyway, he really didnâ€™t go wrong.  But in context, Runescape cheating communities trust that there will be no scamming, and itâ€™s hard to love anyone who does so.<br>
In the long run, you could probably compare MG to Kaitnieks in terms of pure ability.  But Kait had power, not that corrupted, but over himself, and resisted the temptation to abuse his position.  That reason, if anything, should be enough to put the Big K over MG, no matter what either of them did.  And even if you take that into account, AutoRune was definitely more successful than the macros at autominer.tk or MGC.<br>
Sythe, Cheater, and Jansen have kept the community alive for a year now, and it is still going strong.  Runescape cheating has made a full recovery from the slump it endured in the winter of 2004.  Now, when you hear the words â€œclientâ€, â€œmacroâ€, â€œautoâ€, or â€œcheatâ€ in Runescape, you have something to think about.<br>
But there is, arguably, a fourth kind of cheating in Runescape: bug abuse.  It required no real skill, only luck, wits, and bravery.  And it might as well be given that â€œfourthâ€ title, because now, if ever, it has a place in our lives.</p>
<p>CHAPTER SIX</p>
<p>June 6, 2006.  6/6/06.  The Day of the Devil.  Whatever you prefer to Call it, everyone is a little more righteous on this date.  Once every century the day that dates back from Revelation rolls around, along with a fresh crop of â€œdevilâ€ parties and red T-shirts.  In the twenty-first century us Earthlings encountered a special version of this famous date, as we celebrated the twentieth centurial Day of Satan.  In the Runescape world, this meant little more than maybe a few devil jokes rolling around, or the like.  Or so we thought.<br>
The story begins, of course, six days earlier, on May 31st, 2006.  Construction, an old Runescape Classic skill that had disappeared when Runescape 2 showed up, had been resurrected, along with one of the most anticipated updates ever, Player-Owned Houses (PoHâ€™s).  As usual when new skills come out, there began a furious race to see who would ascend to level 99 first.<br>
The battle raged on for five days, as Monkey Moejo, Xn00bxfrei, and Cursed You traded the lead every few hours.  For days, hiscore fanatics followed the race and finally breathed a sigh of relief on June 5th, as Cursed You, famous for being the richest active Runescape player, managed to jump ahead of Monkey for the first-place spot and the honor of being first to level 99.<br>
CY scheduled the customary party for that night, in his brand-new house, full of brand-new items and rooms.  Many people were invited; CY is probably one of the most popular players in the game.<br>
The party was grand.  Most of the attendees admired the house a bit before going down to the basement to watch the ring fights.  Many players took turns in the ring, fighting to their heartsâ€™ content without risk of losing items.<br>
As the party wore on, a group of player killers (PKers) jumped into the ring to have a go.  Among them was Durial321, a level 115 PKer.  The group picked a bad time to start up a game; CY had begun to get restless with his guests and proceeded to kick everyone out.<br>
Durial and his gang had teleported from Falador, and they reappeared there after being expelled.  Immediately, Durial and the others realized they suddenly had a â€“ literally â€“ unbelievable power.<br>
One of the numerous Construction and PoH glitches went off.  Durial and his fellow PKers had been fighting in CYâ€™s house.  When they were kicked out, they still had the ability to attack.  They could attack anyone â€“ anywhere â€“ whenever they wanted.<br>
Durial, having a PK heart and, like most, having dreamed about the possibility of this his entire life, immediately went on a hardcore killing spree.  The crowd seemed divided; half were begging to be killed, not giving a thought to banking their items, and half were confused.  Most of the victims were in the second half, and many of the victims had rares; the natural choice for victims.<br>
Durial and his friends ran around Falador, killing to their heartsâ€™ content.  The PKers were all level 110-120, so most players died in three to four hits.  The other players did not have the ability to fight back, so running was the only option.<br>
Soon, Durial had collected several rares, including a green party hat, which he wore as a sort of disgusting symbol of his violent rampage.  It was actually re-ported that green phats went slightly up in value following the incident, as many players sought to imitate Durial.<br>
The group collected some Santa Hats and other phats, as well as other rares, good armor, random items, and money.  It is estimated that they collected over a billion coins worth of items that day.  Thankfully, Durial and his crew dropped many of the items, which was only to be expected.  Think of it as a crude â€œgiving back to the communityâ€ action.<br>
The mass of people, killers, and victims began to make their way up towards the north.  Player moderators who had heard about the massacre were now run-ning around the crowd, shouting warnings and advice, although most took little heed.  Many players who had been killed teleported back for â€œsecond helpingsâ€, hoping for something to brag about later to their friends.<br>
Eventually, after over an hour, the group reached Edgeville, and it was here that Mod Murdoch was able to find Durial and his fellow PKers.  Immediately, Murdoch kicked off as many of the PKers he could catch.  Durial managed to salvage his green party hat, giving it to a friend to keep in case his account was banned (which it was).  Ironically, his friend ended up running off with it.  It was an amusing action, both hurting the hurter and managing to get one item back from the killer.  Although no one but his â€œfriendâ€ knows which green party hat in Runescape was Durialâ€™s, it is no doubt a priceless relic, the only piece of Durial saved from this historic event (the rest of Durialâ€™s armor and goods were lost when he was permanently banned a couple days later).<br>
In the end, an estimation of over a hundred players were killed in the massacre, and there is no doubt that many of them were probably not happy about it.  One player who was killed and lost some valuables quit Runescape.  Many were un-happy, but just as many were eager to be among the victims.<br>
The forums were on fire with praise, criticism, and discussion about Durial321.  How should he be classified?  As a legend, yes, most agreed with that.  Whether what he did was right or not, he will be remembered for years and this event, now known as the Doomsday Massacre, will probably end up passing the Big Dupe as the most famous event in Runescape history.<br>
Durial, according to the rules, did not do the right thing.  But discovering that you can get 500 experience from a coal rock and discovering that you can kill whoever you want, wherever you want, and they wonâ€™t fight back, are two very different things.  Although this event will be usually called a â€œtragedyâ€, it will no doubt be a fun topic of discussion in the future.  Durial was given the chance of a lifetime, and most of us would have done the same thing.  The choice was report the bug, and probably be made a player moderator for doing the right thing, or abuse the bug, kill everyone in sight, make yourself  a Runescape legend, and get banned.  It is not easy to give up a level 115 player that you have no doubt put your heart into, but Durial realized that he would never get another chance to do something like this, and, for the good of the forums, he abused the bug and en-sured himself a place in the Runescape Hall of Fame.<br>
Whatever your opinion is on Durialâ€™s decision, the Doomsday Massacre was a legendary event and has to be grouped into the category of cheating.  Cheating is breaking the rules, and rule number four says that bugs should not be abused.  Although you canâ€™t be â€œgoodâ€ at bug abusing or decide when to do it, it is still cheating because you are putting your account at risk.  It takes just as much guts and courage to break rule number four as it does to break any other rule.  The chance just doesnâ€™t come along quite as often.<br>
So ends the history of Runescape cheating.  Cheating has come so far in this game, from the earliest version of Ghost Mouse to the latest scripts of SCAR.  The greatest thing of all is that cheating has a future, players to run it, and a strong, solid history to rely on when things start getting blue.  Because of cheating, we have legendary names.  Vee.  Nick.  Alex.  MG.  Sythe.  Jansen.  Cheater.  Cow.  And, above all, Kaitnieks.  And possibly, if you choose to include him, Durial the Great.  Cheating has given us classic moments.  Automining.  The Big Dupe.  The Banker Slayings.  The Doomsday Massacre.  It has given us a reason to play the game.  Without cheating, interest would wane and those who walk the roads of Gielinor would possibly be walking a different world.  For all the pain cheating has caused Runescape, it has always given back to it; it has given it life.</p>
