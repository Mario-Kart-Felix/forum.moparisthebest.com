    <description>So I don&#39;t really know how to define this error as there is no error thrown to me at this time, but basically I have a compiled server and client, that should connect, and do for about 20 seconds can define if you are a new or old player also as new players can login start setting up character, but then it will just like refresh my login packet i think basically from the command prompt window as far as I can tell is that after i log on it reloops me through the login system and my player trie to double log so i get dicoed (could be the client but it works on another similar server this was based one and has no issues i tried cross comparisons but turned up nothing</description>

              <p>Divinity in Darkness custom server based off whitescape with coding help from a few others it had some original siabsoft coding as she was a major part in that project. I sent her a message too about it and will have her look at the coding again if needed. Its like the server will connect for a moment and allow you to type and such but then disconnects saving the game and then trying to automaticaly reconnect me, at an increasing port.</p>
