    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/god-damn-pigs/24225</link>
    <description>Well, I have a question. My girlfriend has been verbally abused since I&#39;ve known her by her mother&#39;s boyfriend. Her mom doesn&#39;t care or do anything about it and I have never had the chance until now. Today her mothers boyfriend kicked her out of the house and told her never to come back. Her mother didn&#39;t say anything or try to stop her at all. My girlfriend then came over here and told us what had happened. We ran back over to her house and asked if my gf could stay here for the weekend just to let things cool down. Her mom said no and told us that she had called my girlfriend in as a run away. Now we wait for the cop to get there and tell him what happened and he didn&#39;t write anything down and told us to leave. Now I don&#39;t know what else to do because the police aren&#39;t doing anything and I can&#39;t afford to get assault and battery charges. Does anyone have any ideas?</description>

              <p>Basically what I’d do is leave him a note saying to leave <em>enter your gf’s name here</em> alone, and if he doesn’t then you’ll make his life a living hell. he may know who you are, but there won’t be any proof of it. But of course, he may call your bluff so you need to start off by doing something really bad to him, like smash his windshield. That’s what I would do. You may want to talk it over with your girlfriend first, they tend to not like it when you try to do what is best for them without their permission.</p>

<p>If I were you, I would go over there and do anything you can to piss him off, as soon as he lays a hand on you then beat the crap out of him. If he decides to charge, say you were acting in self defence, and then bring up all the stuff that he has done. - This is assuming you think you could beat him up. I wouldn’t advise this if you are a 5 ft stick <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
