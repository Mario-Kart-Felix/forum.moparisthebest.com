    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-list-of-things-i-need-help-with/221133</link>
    <description>I am currently working on a Private server and Client. I am starting With the Server Things I Need.

SERVER:
1. I would like to add ess mining but im not sure how i would make it give you ess.  i Would like you to get ess every 1.5-2 seconds
2. I would like to add rune crafting were you click on a alter and it gives you the right amount or runes for ess you have (not using ess on alter just clicking alter).
3. I would like Working Rc Pouches
4. I would like to know how to add complete Wc (normal logs, Willows, maples, yews, and magics.  NO OAK PLEASE)
5. I would like to know how to add fletching (like you use a knife on maple logs, and it gives you the menu to choose). I got the Arrows working

CLIENT:
1. I would like to Know if it is possible to add commands client side, and if so how???
2. 
3. 
4. 

Please don&#39;t spam or post anything that&#39;s not an answer

And Can Any One Post a List Of Interface Id&#39;s.</description>

<li>Case: AlterID<br>
if(skillblashit = skill#youwant)<br>
additem(ItemID,Quantity) etc…</li>
<li>If(hasItem((itemId))…Forgot variable, plus it’s different in most sources, You get the idea.</li>
<li>Case: TreeID<br>
