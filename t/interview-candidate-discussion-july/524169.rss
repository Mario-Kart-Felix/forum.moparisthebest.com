<p>Alright, the candidates are you and Davidi2 for this month. The only thing with interviewing you is that I think it would be a big and popular interview that I think Flame_ would like to be a part of.</p>

              <p>I don’t see anything positive coming out of an interview with Krackkid and I think the MM would be better off if we interviewed people who have contributed to the community in some way. The same applies to drub and so those two will not be considered for this month’s interview candidate.</p>
<p>As MITB has not replied to the PM I sent him, the two available candidates are Tree and Davidi2, so I think that Davidi2 will be this month’s candidate.</p>

              <p>Here are some questions submitted for Davidi2. They’ll need some work before submission but a few of them are interesting questions that might not need any changes.</p>
<blockquote>1) Why did you quit being staff? (besides the obvious got tired of it/well deserved!)
2) is there any chance davidscape will return?
3) Why has your personality/attitude changed on the forums?
4) how does it feel having the most post count on the forums for well over two years running?( I think two years? )
5) Did you ever think you would be mod on here? How did you feel when you first became mod?
6) As a semi-veteran moparian if there was any advice you could give to the newer members what would it be?
7) Do you still program? If so, what language(s)? 
8) Tell us a little bit about yourself. Job,age, etc 
9) Do you have any future goals in either IRL or on Mopar itself?
10) If there was any one thing you could do on mopar for the better what would it be, and why? 
11) Anything else you would like to say?</blockquote>
