    <description>Alright, hopefully in this topic I can get a reply, and not have it be a &quot;0 replies&quot; topic.

Since a character file in a 317 server all consist of nothing but integers that are being saved into it, that leads me to my question: How can I make the character file save a string that holds text into the character file?

The way it saves an integer:

[code]public int blank = 0;[/code]
[code]characterfile.write(&quot;character-blank = &quot;, 0, 18);
characterfile.write(Integer.toString(blank), 0, Integer.toString(blank).length());
characterfile.newLine();[/code]
[code]} else if (token.equals(&quot;character-blank&quot;)) {
blank = Integer.parseInt(token2);[/code]

I think this is the way a string would save:

[code]public String blank = &quot;-Blank-&quot;[/code]
[code]characterfile.write(&quot;character-blank = &quot;, 0, 18);
characterfile.write(blank, 0, blank.length());
characterfile.newLine();[/code]
[code]} else if (token.equals(&quot;character-blank&quot;)) {
blank = (token2);[/code]

But when I did that and I tried to do the thing that I added it for, it wasn&#39;t working. Is that correct or not?</description>

<p>I already did. I added this and modified it so when you make a clan chat, it saves in your char file and you may leave and go to another clan chat while yours still exists for others to go into (while you’re online, of course. But I’ll be making it so people can join your chat while you’re offline.) Still working on it lots.</p>

</aside>
<p>Like… Let’s say I log out and the string equals “Test”. I would log back in and it would equal “Test”, but then if I had something like if(exampleString == “Test”) { whatever the action I put, it won’t do it. So it says it’s “Test” but anything where I ask for it, it doesn’t do anything. I know it’s “Test” when I log on because it says it in my char file and I made a command to check the string and tell me what it’s set to.</p>

              <p>Alright, hopefully in this topic I can get a reply, and not have it be a “0 replies” topic.</p>
<p>Since a character file in a 317 server all consist of nothing but integers that are being saved into it, that leads me to my question: How can I make the character file save a string that holds text into the character file?</p>
<p>The way it saves an integer:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int blank = 0;</code></pre>
<p><code>characterfile.write("character-blank = ", 0, 18);
characterfile.write(Integer.toString(blank), 0, Integer.toString(blank).length());
characterfile.newLine();</code></p>
<p><code>} else if (token.equals("character-blank")) {
blank = Integer.parseInt(token2);</code></p>
<p>I think this is the way a string would save:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public String blank = "-Blank-"</code></pre>
<p><code>characterfile.write("character-blank = ", 0, 18);
characterfile.write(blank, 0, blank.length());
characterfile.newLine();</code></p>
<p><code>} else if (token.equals("character-blank")) {
blank = (token2);</code></p>
<p>But when I did that and I tried to do the thing that I added it for, it wasn’t working. Is that correct or not?</p>
