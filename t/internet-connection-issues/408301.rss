    <title>Internet Connection Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/internet-connection-issues/408301</link>
    <description>Alright so I have my desktop pc that I built upstairs in my room. My router is on the opposite side of the house in a straight line(basically) down a floor. Would that cause any issues with making the connection slow up? Whenever I go on YouTube my connection slows(Not just me, My mom&#39;s computers connection slows too when this happens). I&#39;m just wondering why the connection slows when I go on YouTube because no other sites slow me down. Could it be how far away I am from the router or something else?</description>

<p>I have the exact same thing, it’s no different than being a foot away from the router for me, but it’s not on the COMPLETE opposite side of the house. Why not get a 100ft+ internet cable and run it through the walls/floor? Might cost a little bit, it’s all worth it! /sarcasm</p>
<p>Move the router closer if you have the ability to.[/quote]</p>
<p>I can’t move it closer and it’s definitely the distance because I brought my laptop up and it couldn’t load the YouTube video normally (its taken like at least a half hour and its not fully loaded) but my connection hasn’t slowed up. Weird.</p>
