    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vregscape-hd-version-4-is-loading-please-wait/253076</link>
    <description>Hey all once i had a server called vregScape HD Version 4 and i quited it and started a wow private server but people were sending me mesages and stuff like that for putting it back on so i told them ok. So now everything is finsihed exept one thing on my client, the loading bar it says VregScape HD Version 4 is loading - Please Wait... and my new server is called VregScape Unleashed so it ahs to be VregScape Uneashed Is Loading - Please Wait... . Once i knew how but because of World Of VregCraft (my wow private server) if forgot loads of stuff about rs private servers inculding this problem. So i was wondering if one of you knew how to change that. BTW im using a 508 client. Thank for your attention.</description>
