    <title>Need some opinions/suggestions on my project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-opinions-suggestions-on-my-project/401073</link>
    <description>So I was bored (typical) and decided to start a new project, the first time I&#39;ve ever tried something like this. It&#39;s a Java MORPG (calling it massive would be cliché :P), but I really can&#39;t judge my own work, as I&#39;ve shown in the past, so I wanted some &#39;Veteran&#39; opinions on how I&#39;m doing so far.

I&#39;m working on it with a [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=381268]friend[/url], so far he&#39;s done a little bit (his work is in the playersaving package in the server, everything else I&#39;ve re-done) so don&#39;t be surprised if you look at the contributors page and see his name. We have not written any content yet, so it&#39;s just an empty frame for now.

[url=http://code.google.com/p/unnamed-rpg/source/browse/trunk/RPG/src/server#server%2Fnet%253Fstate%253Dclosed]Server[/url]
[url=http://code.google.com/p/unnamedrpgclient/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FRPGCLIENT%2Fsrc%253Fstate%253Dclosed]Client[/url]

The client is still in a mock-upped form to test pathfinding and map drawing, so if you see those don&#39;t worry about it. 

One thing I really think I did wrong was how I draw the map offset (I&#39;m just using x and y variables in the local player class...) so I&#39;d really like some help with that.


Oh, and it&#39;s [b]all[/b] obviously still in progress, nothing is finalized, so all thoughts are welcome :)

EDIT - We&#39;ll probably need some graphics designers for default components and interfaces, neither of us are very artsy :P</description>

              <p>There are many reasons to prefer implementing Runnable over extending Thread. I can name a few of them here aswell.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Separation of concerns. An operation and the one performing this operation are both distinct concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can only run a Thread once; its life-cycle ends and it cannot be run again. But you can run a Runnable more than once, if you implemented it that way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The java.util.concurrent API uses Runnable and Callable. Although, Thread is itself a Runnable, it (conceptually) makes no sense to use it as a Runnable in an ExecutorService.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As you already know, implementing an interface is more flexible than extending a class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To extend a class means that an instance of your class actually is an instance of your parent class. To benefit from using your class, it should contain more functionality than your parent class. It should also not change the existing functionality of your parent class, because then there’s no guarantee it will work in all situations your parent class already works. So, instead, implement Runnable in pretty much all cases. Thread after all has an aggregation alternative, which is much more flexible. It delegates its own Runnable operation to the aggregated Runnable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A stupid analogy: We could say a Thread is an engine while a Runnable is the fuel for that engine. If you buy a new engine, you may get some fuel just because the owners of the store are nice, but I suspect this usually won’t happen. But if, on the other hand, you buy some new fuel at the local fueling station, you def. won’t get a new engine (it would be wicked awesome though). <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Crap… I usually do implement runnable, I don’t even know why I didn’t this time…</p>
<p>Well that’ll be fixed in the next commit. Right now working on upgrading a map editor I made a month or two ago to work with the new map format we’ll be using.</p>

<p>It’s a bit pedantic in this case, since extending Thread and implementing Runnable have pretty much the same end result.</p>
<p>The accepted convention in object-oriented programming [citation needed] is to extend a class only if you plan to augment the functionality or interface exposed by that class. On the other hand, implementing an interface is done to show that your class conforms to the functionality that the interface guarantees.</p>
<p>/most/ people creating threads don’t actually want to extend Java’s threading functionality, they just want to run code on a separate thread concurrently. So, implementing the interface makes more sense.</p>

should be implementing Runnable, not extending Thread?</p>

              <p>So I was bored (typical) and decided to start a new project, the first time I’ve ever tried something like this. It’s a Java MORPG (calling it massive would be cliché :P), but I really can’t judge my own work, as I’ve shown in the past, so I wanted some ‘Veteran’ opinions on how I’m doing so far.</p>
<p>I’m working on it with a <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=381268" data-bbcode="true">friend</a>, so far he’s done a little bit (his work is in the playersaving package in the server, everything else I’ve re-done) so don’t be surprised if you look at the contributors page and see his name. We have not written any content yet, so it’s just an empty frame for now.</p>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/unnamed-rpg/source/browse/trunk/RPG/src/server#server%2Fnet%253Fstate%253Dclosed" data-bbcode="true">Server</a><br>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/unnamedrpgclient/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FRPGCLIENT%2Fsrc%253Fstate%253Dclosed" data-bbcode="true">Client</a></p>
<p>The client is still in a mock-upped form to test pathfinding and map drawing, so if you see those don’t worry about it.</p>
<p>One thing I really think I did wrong was how I draw the map offset (I’m just using x and y variables in the local player class…) so I’d really like some help with that.</p>
<p>Oh, and it’s <span class="bbcode-b">all</span> obviously still in progress, nothing is finalized, so all thoughts are welcome <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT - We’ll probably need some graphics designers for default components and interfaces, neither of us are very artsy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
