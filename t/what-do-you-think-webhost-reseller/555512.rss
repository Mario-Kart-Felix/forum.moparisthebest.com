    <title>What do you think? - WebHost Reseller</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-think-webhost-reseller/555512</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m starting a webhost reseller acc and after finishing the site I was thinking about offering something strictly to the mopar community.

The first 10 people would get free hosting for a year(buy your domain from us or somewhere else) and the next 200 people would get a free month if they purchase a year package(you wouldn&#39;t be charged until the first month is over)

Is that something you guys would be in to or am I wasting my time trying to give back to the comm?</description>
