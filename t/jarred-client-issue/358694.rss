    <title>Jarred Client Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jarred-client-issue/358694</link>
    <description>I was trying to make a webclient using Ric&#39;s tutorial, and everything was working fine.

I decided to test the client to make sure it works before I use the Jar Maker to compile the class files into a jar.
The cache downloads and extracts perfectly, and the client runs and you are able to log into the correct server.

However, when I jar the client, and run it, the client gets to &quot;Connecting to update server&quot;, and then it gives me that error that says...
&quot;Sorry, there was an error whilst trying to load RuneScape&quot;

I think this is because when the Jar Maker loads all the class files and compresses them, it does not include the signlink class because its in its own folder, seperate from the other class files.
When I try to move the signlink class into the same folder as all the other classes, the client compiles fine, but it doesn&#39;t run without jarring it. (It doesn&#39;t work after you jar it either mind you.)

Can someone tell me how to move the signlink into the folder with all the other class files without messing up the client?
Rep++ for help ofc.</description>

However, instead of changing the paths for just the sprites, I changed the paths for everything that was directed at the cache folder.</p>
