    <title>Need a 614+ coder</title>

    <description>Am looking at starting a RSPS which will involve PVP as well as an economy.

I have a budget of $1,000 for gold banners , advertisement fee&#39;s and a VPS I am aiming to get this server in to the top 5 RSPS&#39;s and am deadly serious.

To achieve my aims I need the best of the best and now am asking you please do &quot;NOT&quot; reply or add my skype if you have no idea on how to code it&#39;s really starting to bug me!

Some stuff which I&#39;d be looking at having on the server.

Donator area.
Yell - Donators
Vote point system
100% working prayer - mage
100% matching armour stats (Runescape)
Donator shop insisting of (Torva , pernix , spirit shields etc)
Loyalty points (donator)
Maybe a bit of PVM if your interested in adding it.
Working friends chat
Working private messaging
Effects and GFX near to Runescape as possible

Basically looking to create an inspirational RSPS.

I&#39;ll either pay a one off fee once you&#39;ve made it , or I&#39;ll pay a nominal fee and you can be a co-owner ( coder ) something of which I&#39;d prefer.

Now please don&#39;t pm me or add my skype if you can only code basic servers.

Pm me or add my skype &quot;tom.popplestone&quot;

Thank&#39;s,

Tom.</description>
