    <title>Help with portforwarding, and a big reward too!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-portforwarding-and-a-big-reward-too/162181</link>
    <description>My friend has an Actiontec, and the Portforward.com isn&#39;t accurate to his router..

This is what it asks him to enter, and I need to know, what does he need to enter in these...

Port Start:______
Port Ends:______
Port Map Start:_____


What should he enter in these? PM Me please. I probably will lose this topic. Thanks.

EDIT: Should he enter,
Port Start: 43594
Port Ends: 43594
Port Map: 1</description>
