        <p>So, I’m going to start off this thread with a TL;DR:</p>
<p>I’ve been in the RSPS scene for too long, I need to cut my ties with it and move on, I was going to be re-oppening my oldest server but I’ve decided I’m wasting my time in doing so, I already gave the RSPS away and started to develop it and now I don’t want to develop in anymore, my site has 1 year pre-paid hosting since Mid February 2013 (aswell as Domain) registered with Trentahost, donations and profits can be discussed with the new owner, all I require is the 15$ a month I pay my self for the VPS.</p>
<p>The long version:</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Dave.</p>
<p>in 2008 I used to run an RSPS called RuneLive/E-RSPS/EuroScape PK and it really took off in 2009 becoming the number 1 RSPS for around a year and 3 months (around there) I then closed it due to staff corruption and development issues (developers tried to infect members by downloading and executing harmful files in the Cache Downloader). I re-oppened RuneLive in October 2010 and gained around 250-300 players within 2 weeks and closed in March 2011 due to not being able to cope with the amount of growth, I was then hired by another server.</p>
<p>July 2011 I finally had finished with the server I was previously hired by and opened a server called Elysian-PK which lived for around 6 months and closed due to money issues &amp; DMCA’s from Jagex LTD, I then stopped with RSPS till June last year where I started to work on a RuneLive remake again which was a big hit for around 3 months and closed due to money problems (with people donating and charging back making it hard to figure out whether we could make that months payment), I then started to work on a server called Complexity which had 20 players when I started to develop it and grew to 150 within 3 weeks of constant updates and tweaks, due to corruption with the Co-Owner selling items for his own profits I confronted him and he left and made constant attacks to the server, I was then offered my payment owed and the option to leave so he could come back, I took it.</p>
<p>Now I’m back with RuneLive after a short break of RSPS to end my ties with RSPS all together, I’m looking for someone that can show me previous work and experience and can provide reasons of why they won’t get bored with the RSPS and become money hungry, what will you get in return? a <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">fair </span></span> split of the donations and the opportunity to work with a server that has a great reputation but just needs that little push to become popular again, You will receive access to the VPS and Website, I’m more then happy to pay for VPS upgrades as the VPS currently has 1GB RAM but only if your sure I can be paid back.</p>
<p>I’m not a snake, I’m one of the few server owners who care about the players enjoyment rather then making a quick buck.</p>

<p>Name: Logan. You can contact me on skype @ LoganGar via the skype directory, (In case you don’t know how :p)<br>
Age: 19 as of last month.<br>
Experience: Well, I don’t have any recent photos, and/or videos like Advertisement threads or anything, but I can show you over skype, or what ever. I mostly work with Content development, but I do know SQL, and A lot of networking task. I not only know java but I do know a few other languages that I can’t bother typing up what I know or don’t know, so if you need more information on that subject please feel free to contact me via PM and/or skype.<br>
Why do you think you’re suitable to Develop/Run RuneLive?: Well that’s a very vague question, so I will answer in a vague reply, I don’t “Think” I’m suitable, I KNOW i’m suitable, I’ve been in the RSPS/Gaming biz for a long time, and I’ve had pretty much nothing but good memories and success.</p>
