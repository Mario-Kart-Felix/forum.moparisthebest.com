    <description>So, I&#39;m going to start off this thread with a TL;DR:

I&#39;ve been in the RSPS scene for too long, I need to cut my ties with it and move on, I was going to be re-oppening my oldest server but I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m wasting my time in doing so, I already gave the RSPS away and started to develop it and now I don&#39;t want to develop in anymore, my site has 1 year pre-paid hosting since Mid February 2013 (aswell as Domain) registered with Trentahost, donations and profits can be discussed with the new owner, all I require is the 15$ a month I pay my self for the VPS.

The long version:

Hi, I&#39;m Dave.

in 2008 I used to run an RSPS called RuneLive/E-RSPS/EuroScape PK and it really took off in 2009 becoming the number 1 RSPS for around a year and 3 months (around there) I then closed it due to staff corruption and development issues (developers tried to infect members by downloading and executing harmful files in the Cache Downloader). I re-oppened RuneLive in October 2010 and gained around 250-300 players within 2 weeks and closed in March 2011 due to not being able to cope with the amount of growth, I was then hired by another server.

July 2011 I finally had finished with the server I was previously hired by and opened a server called Elysian-PK which lived for around 6 months and closed due to money issues &amp; DMCA&#39;s from Jagex LTD, I then stopped with RSPS till June last year where I started to work on a RuneLive remake again which was a big hit for around 3 months and closed due to money problems (with people donating and charging back making it hard to figure out whether we could make that months payment), I then started to work on a server called Complexity which had 20 players when I started to develop it and grew to 150 within 3 weeks of constant updates and tweaks, due to corruption with the Co-Owner selling items for his own profits I confronted him and he left and made constant attacks to the server, I was then offered my payment owed and the option to leave so he could come back, I took it.

Now I&#39;m back with RuneLive after a short break of RSPS to end my ties with RSPS all together, I&#39;m looking for someone that can show me previous work and experience and can provide reasons of why they won&#39;t get bored with the RSPS and become money hungry, what will you get in return? a [B][I]fair [/I][/B] split of the donations and the opportunity to work with a server that has a great reputation but just needs that little push to become popular again, You will receive access to the VPS and Website, I&#39;m more then happy to pay for VPS upgrades as the VPS currently has 1GB RAM but only if your sure I can be paid back.

I&#39;m not a snake, I&#39;m one of the few server owners who care about the players enjoyment rather then making a quick buck.

              <p>I am also curious as to what revision this would be, or what you are interested in doing atleast, But I will go ahead and post my application just in case:</p>
<p>Name: Logan. You can contact me on skype @ LoganGar via the skype directory, (In case you don’t know how :p)<br>
Age: 19 as of last month.<br>
Experience: Well, I don’t have any recent photos, and/or videos like Advertisement threads or anything, but I can show you over skype, or what ever. I mostly work with Content development, but I do know SQL, and A lot of networking task. I not only know java but I do know a few other languages that I can’t bother typing up what I know or don’t know, so if you need more information on that subject please feel free to contact me via PM and/or skype.<br>
Why do you think you’re suitable to Develop/Run RuneLive?: Well that’s a very vague question, so I will answer in a vague reply, I don’t “Think” I’m suitable, I KNOW i’m suitable, I’ve been in the RSPS/Gaming biz for a long time, and I’ve had pretty much nothing but good memories and success.</p>
