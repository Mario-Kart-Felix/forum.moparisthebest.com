    <title>I need help with antiflood</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-with-antiflood/352292</link>
    <description>I got the antiflood from here...  http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=445776.0

and when I put those in, I can&#39;t log in, but the other players can, on my side is shows no server response try a different world. If someone could look at the code and tell me if its supposed to do that or if its not, how can I make to where I can keep the antiflood and login.

BTW I am hosting from my computer, just if that helps with anything.    Im running a 562 source.</description>
