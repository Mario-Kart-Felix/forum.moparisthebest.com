Please PM me if you have teamviewer to help me solve this!

Okay, so I zipped all of the contents from the inside of my cache folder... I uploaded it to dropbox to my public folder, copied the public link, put it inside of the cachedownloader, compiled: no errors. But just to check if it&#39;s working I delete the cache from my C:/ and then empty my recycle bin. use the jar maker on my compiled client folder, open the .jar file  I had just made, it downloads the cache from 1-100% but then after &quot;requesting title screen&quot; it goes to connection error. So I went and looked to see what had happened.. it just shows a rar folder with the name of my cache and a 20% in the middle of the title.. See if you guys can find anything wrong here.... I can&#39;t.</description>
