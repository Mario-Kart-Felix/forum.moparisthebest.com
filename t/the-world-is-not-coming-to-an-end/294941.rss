    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-world-is-not-coming-to-an-end/294941</link>
    <description>I just wanted to post this topic because I&#39;ve seen a lot of crap being spread saying &quot;the world&#39;s gonna end in 2012!&quot;. First, the world is NOT going to end. Second, 2012 is when the Mayan calendar resets. It just restarts! The Mayan calendar ends in 2012 and then it restarts. Don&#39;t ask me why. If you don&#39;t believe me and still think the world is going to end, then we&#39;ll just have to wait and see. The world &quot;ends&quot; on 12/21/2012 as some people say.</description>

<p>a nuke will have huge impact on the global conditions (or it should from what I know) but one country nuking another does not mean everyone dying. It just means the local areas being affected. At least someone will be alive… unless every place on earth is nuked which I doubt will happen.</p>

<p>you’ve been brainwashed. If the world ended everytime nostradamus had supposedly predicted it then it would have happened more frequently than your birthday. Everytime people who belive his bullshit look at his charts and decipher what he wrote and they pick a date out of their ass. Then when the world doesnt end, they go back and say ‘oh i mistranslated’ and pick another date. Thats how nostradamus’ writings have worked. Alot of the decoding of his works are the biggest load of bullshit ive ever seen. Ever heard the phrase you see what you want to see? Well basically they decipher Nostradamus’ work by saying that he used certain cryptic languages to write his work and that you pick the letters from each sentence and so forth. What they are effectively doing is just going through each word/line/paragraph picking up enough letters to form a historical event that was after his time to show he could predict stuff or something in the future. If you believe the writings of nostradamus then you really need to get out more, or get a magic 8 ball its on the same level<br>

              <p>The world has a chance of ending at any time. Who knows what goes on out there in space. It’s not like we could be warned before something exploded and killed us…I’m not really sure what would happen. Nostradamus made many predictions way back in the day and they all came true. He also predicted 2012. I guess we just have to see. Either way, I want to see the movie 2012. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
