    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-kno-how-to-make-silabsoft-work-on-vista/181166</link>
    <description>WELL, I really don&#39;t like silabsoft, but my gay brother won&#39;t let me on the computer so I have to figure this out. (My other computer has all my server files ect.) 

~The Problem~
It loads fine, then when I get to the login, I login and then it says loading - please wait and never goes away -.-&quot;. If anyone has a download link to silabsoft v5 or v4 that works with vista, that be great. (all the 1s i try never work)


Thanks in advance.</description>
