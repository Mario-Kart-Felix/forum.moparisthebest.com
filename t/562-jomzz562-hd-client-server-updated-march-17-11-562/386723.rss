[center]Hello Welcome to the Jomzz562 Development Project. I have been coding RuneScape Private Servers for about 3 years now. Started with Moparscape 3.2 lol... Then I realized there was more behind a game then downloading a client base from a site. I have made several 317 bases and 508s. This is my third time trying to make a 562, (All the Sources I tried to use before would stop running after I added a shop). I am looking for 3 Coder. These 3 coders would be Administrators, and the only Administrators for Jomzz562. So far there are 2 Owners, Me (TheJamDude/James), and a good friend of mine who can code.
Sorry I do not have pictures soon, I am going to be talking them soon. So far I am working on adding shops, adding the content handlers.
