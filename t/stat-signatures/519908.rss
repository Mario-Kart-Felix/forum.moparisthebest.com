    <title>Stat Signatures</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stat-signatures/519908</link>
    <description>I am bored so i decided to make dynamic stat signatures, what users would be able to do is register their own server and the script will then look in the users provided highscore link to see if there are any matches. If there are matches (preg_match_all function) it will be able to get stats. Currently i am only doing one server but i am planning to make it customizable

I am facing a problem though, some servers have cloudflare and curl is not working. ( i have tried to remove curl and then the page went fast )

Here is the code:

[code]
$url = &quot;&quot;.$clean_url_highscores.&quot;/personal.php?name=$username&quot;;
$start = curl_init ($url);
curl_setopt($start, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$page = curl_exec($start);
[/code]

it all works fine for servers who do not have cloudflare..
is there any way to get around this problem? It is just loading ages now then it echos max execution time


Also, sorry if you got cancer from reading my thread xD not so good doing this

Thx in advance</description>
