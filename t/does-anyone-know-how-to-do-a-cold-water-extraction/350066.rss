    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-know-how-to-do-a-cold-water-extraction/350066</link>
    <description>Does anyone on here have any experience in CWE&#39;s with Hydrocodone? I looked it up and I think I can proceed into doing it but I just want to know if anyone has any tips or something over it. I also have no clue what the hydrocodone/water ratio is, and I would like to know it.</description>

<p>Yes but my life sucks and I’m stressed out and it gives an amazing high when you use over recommended dosage.<br>

<p>That mush APAP so often will cause me to go deaf. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> It’s a method of filtering out the APAP. I already did it and it worked so you can lock this if you want.</p>
