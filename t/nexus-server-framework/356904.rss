    <title>Nexus Server Framework</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nexus-server-framework/356904</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;m not going to pussy-foot around and say that I&#39;m going to have EVERY feature that RuneScape has. That&#39;s simply not going to happen. But what I can say is that this framework will be easy to use, extensible, and most of all, will not be restritced to RuneScape servers. It will basically be an all purpose game server engine. So you could make a MU server, WoW Server, any sort of server that you want. But, I need your help. I need Ideas and features that will be efficient, yet powerful. Here are just a few of the features I plan on implementing:


[ul][li]NIO Networking with netty[/li]
[li]RSA implementation for the login block(mostly aimed at the RS Client, as well as password hashing server side, for even more security with your account)[/li]
[li]Database storage for data(Player information, item, object, npc data)[/li][/ul]


As you can see, a lot still needs to be added. So if you have any ideas on things to add, like event queues, etc, please feel free to add them.</description>

              <p>take a look at the darkplaces MMOG game base. there is also the red dwarf server (a community fork). It would be worth taking a look at.</p>
