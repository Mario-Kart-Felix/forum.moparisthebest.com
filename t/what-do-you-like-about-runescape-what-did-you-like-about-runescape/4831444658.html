Just because you were 9 years old in the year 2006, does not mean you may categorize a whole community as that age simply based on the fact that they were nicer. The truth is the general population of the game during this time were ages 14 - 22. This is backed up by a database chart of registered ages provided by a popular runescape community website.</p>
<p>The truth is, the community was a better community 7 years ago than it was today. Why? The internet has poisoned the brains of people like you and created hate filled trolls who put others down to make themselves feel better.<br>
This was not the case back then due to its young age of approximately 10 years give or take.[/quote]<br>

        <p>I miss back when there was a sense of community, back when to sell items you had to stand in varrock west and merch them. Back when being a lobster fisher was profitable and people make their living off of doing such. Back when a mercher wasn’t just a dick with 20b buying out all of an item so he can sell it back for 40b and ruin the games eco in one day. Back when you couldn’t stand in an area and make money money hosting gambles in an hour than you could playing the game for a year. Back when skills were hard to be buyable and you looked up to people that really put hard work into the game. Back when there were clans that cared about each other and hosted events. Back when your RS friends would come hang out with you and train rather than power level and not talk for 6 hours. Back when people wanted to play the game, not just had too.</p>

Let me explain why your logic is as flawed as always.<br>
Just because you were 9 years old in the year 2006, does not mean you may categorize a whole community as that age simply based on the fact that they were nicer. The truth is the general population of the game during this time were ages 14 - 22. This is backed up by a database chart of registered ages provided by a popular runescape community website.</p>

Odd, you’re saying I was 9 back then but it looks like you where 11 back then, whats the difference? You’re still as retarded as you probably where then as you are now.</p>

</aside>
<p>Let me explain why your logic is as flawed as always.<br>
Just because you were 9 years old in the year 2006, does not mean you may categorize a whole community as that age simply based on the fact that they were nicer. The truth is the general population of the game during this time were ages 14 - 22. This is backed up by a database chart of registered ages provided by a popular runescape community website.</p>
<p>The truth is, the community was a better community 7 years ago than it was today. Why? The internet has poisoned the brains of people like you and created hate filled trolls who put others down to make themselves feel better.<br>
This was not the case back then due to its young age of approximately 10 years give or take.<br>

        <p>[quote=“Classic, post:7, topic:483144”]I don’t like when people said the community was great back in 06, and everything was amazing. First off, everyone was like 9 when they played in 2006, so obviously you’re going to remember some nice people because everyone was a kid.</p>
<p>Second off, RuneScape isn’t about money, the thing is they’re struggling as a company. Hard. They need to pay the devs to produce new content for you guys, so they had to make these micro transactions, the content isn’t half bad either. <span class="bbcode-b">I bet atleast 80% of people who say they hate the EoC hasn’t tried it. They’ve recently created drygore weapons, working on the new grandmaster quest, reworked a lot of places such as al kharid, the wizards tower, and made the kalphite king, and the PoP.</span></p>
<p>Get your head out of the clouds, 2006 is just nostalgia.</p>
<p>Anyyywayy, I really enjoy the questing and the aspect that you can have so many skills to train on runescape <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Edit: any spelling errors, sry on my phone[/quote]</p>
<p>Has it ever occured to you that we enjoy simplicity? If we wanted wow, we would play wow.<br>
Runescape thrived on simplicity for the longest time and now with the radical change it’s just far too much.</p>
