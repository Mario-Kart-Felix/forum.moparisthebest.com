    <title>What would you do?</title>

    <description>
Okay, I ride MARTA (Subway type shit) to school everyday. Friday, I walked down to the station and I was the only one there. I saw a wallet on the bench. I was with my friend and so we looked at it. No cash, but three credit cards, ID, Military Service card, all her medical and the likes cards, personal info card (Had her SSN on it). Looks like a hispanic girl, she&#39;s 22.

We figured the train JUST left cause we were the first ones there. No service to call her Contact number because we were underground. I kept it (no police or MARTA employees at that time) so I could call her and see about getting it back to her soon (she couldn&#39;t have gone far, her MARTA card was in it so she&#39;d be stuck in MARTA. At my station I called, and it&#39;s her home phone, which has been disconnected.

She has her email on that, so I took it home with me to shoot her an email and see about getting it back to her. Identity theft could SERIOUSLY fuck someone over so I wasn&#39;t going to use it or anything and I mainly kept it so no one else could. I&#39;d rather it be stowed away in my room or me burn it or something than have it in some criminals hands.

So my question is (be serious guys, I know it&#39;s hard but still):
What would you have done?
Left it there? Taken shit? Used it? Posted it on the web? Given it to an authority?</description>

              <p>First i would have taken it home and tried to contact her in some way. I would appreciate knowing how she felt getting it back rather than not knowing if she ever got it back by just leaving it there. same goes for if some whack job got it. that wouldn’t be good, and i wouldn’t like it if it happened to me. anyways, if i didn’t have any way to contact her in like a week or so i would give it to authorities.</p>

              <p>I have had my wallet returned before after having lost it, I had about $400.00 and it was all gone. I was tempted to have the fingerprints run by a friend that is a local cop. But in the end I was glad they didn’t take my Credit Card and id. I mean I wouldn’t want something like that happen to someone else, so I would most likely return it with everything inside.</p>

I would return a wallet with all the money left inside it. No doubt about that in my mind, however if I just found money on its own without a wallet I would take it. But funny story, one of the first times out with Susie we were walking through this park and I looked down to find a £5 note. Picked it up and spent it on an ice cream.</p>
<p>Weird thing was that over a year later I was walking through the same path with Susie, looked down and there was another £5 there. Ice cream was good.<br>

And then the sex would of been good, chicks love ice-cream![/quote]</p>
<p>It’s true man…</p>
<p>One moment you buy them icecream, the next your getting <span class="bbcode-s">testicles dipped in your mouth when I was 14…</span> laid by a jew</p>
