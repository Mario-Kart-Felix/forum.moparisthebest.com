    <title>Need help with car</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-car/553249</link>
    <description>So I have been working on my car and at first it would only click and make these clicking sounds when I tried to start it. So I put in a new starter and now when I try to start it, it sounds like it is about to start it starts rumming but it wont completely turn over. So I checked the ignition coil and I noticed there is no electricity or sparks or pulses going through it. 

I had a friend come over and he said it is either the pickup sensor on the distributor or we just need a new ignition coil.

For those car guys out there any suggestions would be great or any thoughts or ideas you think might be the problem would help greatly! 

And I checked the gas as well and it is filled.
And we have a new battery.</description>

              <p>I doubt it’s the same issue but I know the alternator relates to the  battery in someway/fashion.  On our 2003 expedition as well there are tomes when the spark plugs or the wiring for the spark plugs have caused us issues during start up ( that and also when driving it’s like the  expedition jumps )</p>
<p>Another viable tool would be to get some advice on the Best Buy forums they have a section purely for auto and one of their Super Users named AutoTech is a wiz at all this technical stuff.</p>

              <p>Even though your batteries new, I’d check there cause I had that same exact issue and it was because my battery wasn’t giving power.</p>

<p>When you put the starter in did you check to see if it engages the clutch?</p>
