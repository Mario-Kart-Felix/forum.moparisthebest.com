    <title>Runescape exp values?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-exp-values/218971</link>
    <description>Does anyone have the actual values that rs gives you when you steal from a shop, hit a monster, chop down a tree ect. My server is going to be one of those that its somewhat harder to level on. So if someone could provide me with them that would be awesome. 

Other matters: Does anyone have a list of colors i can use in my client/server?</description>
