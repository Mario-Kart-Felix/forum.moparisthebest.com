    <title>Okay I seriously need help with shops</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/okay-i-seriously-need-help-with-shops/160256</link>
    <description>Okay, whenever I try to put in a shop, I do everything correct, but when I try to talk to the npc, the shop doesn&#39;t come up

I put this in client.java under both first click and second click, used 41 because it was the next number on the shop list
[code]else if (NPCID == 608) { // White Knight Salesman
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 41; //White Knight Sales
}[/code]

I put this under autospawn.cfg
[code]spawn = 608	3251	3430	0	3251	3430	3251	3430	2	White Knight[/code]
and this under shop.cfg
[code]shop = 41	White_Sales	2	2	6522	10000	6523	100	6524	100	6525	100	6526	100	6527	100	6528	100	6569	100	6571	100	6572	100	6573	100	6575	100	6577	100	6579	100	6581	100	6570	100[/code]

can anyone help me fix this error. please. kinda desperate at this point.</description>

<p>I put this in client.java under both first click and second click, used 41 because it was the next number on the shop list</p>
<p><code>else if (NPCID == 608) { // White Knight Salesman
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = 41; //White Knight Sales
}</code></p>
<p>I put this under autospawn.cfg</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 608	3251	3430	0	3251	3430	3251	3430	2	White Knight</code></pre>
<p>and this under shop.cfg</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 41	White_Sales	2	2	6522	10000	6523	100	6524	100	6525	100	6526	100	6527	100	6528	100	6569	100	6571	100	6572	100	6573	100	6575	100	6577	100	6579	100	6581	100	6570	100</code></pre>
