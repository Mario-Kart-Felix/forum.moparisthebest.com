    <title>Editing the cache and deobing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/editing-the-cache-and-deobing/67927</link>
    <description>Hello, I felt that I would ask three questions in the same topic to save room so I do not spam.

[u]Question #1[/u]
I have heard many people say they have &quot;edited the cache&quot;.  What is in this cache, and how do they edit it?

[u]Question #2[/u]
I have seen many topics about editing textures, but is there any way to use a progrom like mspaint or anything like that to edit the graphics?  Also can I edit NPC looks?

[u]Question #3[/u]
I know many people have said deobing.  I sort of know what it means, but how do you do this? and do you need software?  If so where can I get software to deob?  ohh and what is the full word that deob means?</description>
