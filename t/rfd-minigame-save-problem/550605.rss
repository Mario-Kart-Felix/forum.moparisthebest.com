<p>For one, that’s not a valid java class name. No spaces, no hyphens. I’m looking at the contents right now. Also, in the future, uploading it to something like pastie or pastebin would be easier.</p>

<p>Aight ill keep that in mind to put it on pastebin or w.e. uhh, what do you mean with a valid java class name, whats a correct one then?<br>
Also if u wanna explain it decent to me add me on skype : nielskeeeeeeeen , u can also teamview me if you want.</p>

</aside>
<p>As in the name of the class is PlayerSave, but you saved it as PlayerSave - kopie.java; Java is very specific about it’s convention in this aspect. Also, the reason it’s not saving, is because you haven’t told it to save it; at least not in the file that you posted. Do you have a PlayerSave.java file?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Thats was the PlayerSave.java, but i copied it and uploaded it. Bit thats the normal Playersave.java</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Okay then that’s why it’s not working. I couldn’t find any keys in the file dealing with rfd.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Could you maybe help me out how to fix it? Like help my by teamviewer or skype? I’m in some serious need of help…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry, but no. I’m sure if you did a search in the tutorials section, there would probably be something about adding fields to the player save.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeh i’ve fixed it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
