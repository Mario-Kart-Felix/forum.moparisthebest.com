    <description>Looking for feedback on how well it strikes the point, the point being, &quot;How did Martin Luther affect the Renaissance&quot;

Not looking for grammar, my dad found all that mess.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Martin Luther
	Martin Luther was born in on November 10, 1483. During this time, the Roman Catholic church was a disgrace to God. The clergy new nothing of the bible. They acted upon their own lusts and greed. Using their powers as “men of God” they accepted money for the forgiveness of one&#39;s sins. They believed and taught that the only way to heaven was by good works and prayer. Martin Luther was taught this too. As he grew older and gathered more knowledge, he began to see the flaws in the Church&#39;s indulgences, art, hierarchy, and the Church&#39;s teachings.
	The seed for questioning the Church&#39;s teachings was planted in him in college. Luther read Ockham&#39;s doctrine which stated that even the Pope and the Council can make mistakes (5 342). This fact, gave him the power to question the Church&#39;s teachings. One of the main teachings was salvation by good works.
	There was a problem with salvation by good works. In the bible, Romans chapter 3 verse 27 and 28, “Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? Nay; but by the law of faith. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.” These 2 verses directly contradict with the teaching of salvation by good works. So why is it that the clergy teaches it? Do they not know the bible? Are they unfamiliar with these verses? Has the Pope really made such a huge mistake? These are the questions we can assume Luther asked himself.
	Indulgences were the main cause for the beginning of the reformation. It began with Leo X&#39;s Indulgence of 1517(5, 340). The Indulgence of 1517 was Leo X&#39;s hope of gaining enough money to finish the rebuilding of the St. Peter&#39;s church. Pope Leo offered the forgiveness of sins one had done and the forgiveness of sins not yet committed. Doing so, Pope Leo put himself on a pedistal above the apostles, the angels and the saints, and put himself next to Christ (5, 339). A man named Johann Tetzel was going all over Europe selling indulgences on behalf of the pope. When Teztel visited Wittenburg, where Martin Luther was a professor of theology, he sold the indulgences to a group of people. Several, after buying the indulgence, went to see Luther so that he could pass it. Luther was outraged and refused to sign it. At this, Teztel denounced Luther and called him a heretic (5, 340). In response, Luther created the 95 theses. He titled it, “Disputatio Pro Declaratione Virtutis Indulgentiarum,” translated to, “Disputation for Clarification of the Power of Indulgence,” (5 340). On October 31, 1517, he posted it on the main door of the castle Church of Wittenburg for all to see (5 341).
	The 95 theses addressed everything he saw wrong with the Church and some of his theses attacked the pope directly. In theses 86 Luther wrote, “Again: since the pope&#39;s income to-day is larger than that of the wealthiest of wealthy men, why does he not build this one church of St. Peter with his own money, rather than with the money of indigent believers? ” (2 182). Tetzel responded with the 106 anti-theses. In this, Tetzel stated that all 95 theses were theological opinion and held no biblical fact, and once again, he called Luther a heretic (5 345). Luther countered with “A Sermon of Indulgences and Grace,” in this, Luther said that, “only those who do not know the bible can call me a heretic,” (5 346). On this fact alone, Luther had the faith in his person studies of the bible to delve deeper into what the Catholic Church had been doing wrong for centuries.
	Luther began to criticise art, sculptures, and other “worldly” items in churches. The art depicted in churches hold no value to Christ. In his series, “Lectures on Romans” he says  that “organs, altar decorations, and pictures are tokens of reality and are childish,” (3 43). Not only are they childish, they are very dangerous. Many people were praying to the images of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the Apostles. They worshipped wooden crafts and pictures that should be to God alone. This practice is called idolatry. 
	Luther refers to several verses in Deuteronomy chapter 4, v. 16, 
“Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,”  and v. 27 and 28, “And the Lord shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the Lord shall lead you. And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men&#39;s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell,”
	Luther goes on to describe idolatry as when whoever places an image in a church imagines he has performed a service to God and done a good work (3 47). Instead of spending money on, “vain fool&#39;s work and production,” (3 44). He says it is better to give the poor a gold piece than a golden image of God (3 47). His writings sparked mob riots that would go through churches and take down icons. Luther insisted that icons must be removed by administration, not by mobs and that we must destroy images by tearing them out of the heart through God&#39;s word (3 45). As time moved on, Luther&#39;s outlook on art began to change. He stated that images are neither “here nor there, good nor evil,” (3 47). As long as one was not worshipping the images, it was fine to keep them up. It was when one prayed or forgiveness to the image that action should be taken (3 46).
	Not only did Luther question indulgences and art, he also questioned the Pope&#39;s power. He challenged many of the Pope&#39;s powers. In theses 75 and 76, “It is foolish to think that papal indulgences have so much power that they can absolve a man even if he has done the impossible and violated the mother of God. We assert the contrary, and say that the pope&#39;s pardons are not able to remove the least venial of sins as far as their guilt is concerned. ” (7 8). Luther calls the Pope&#39;s power of forgiveness into question. The Pope has no power to forgive sins not committed yet, Luther explains that this ”is blasphemy against St. Peter and the pope,“ (7 7). 
	Luther wrote on Leo X, “I am at a loss to know whether the Pope is antichrist or apostle,” (3 349).  Here Luther is referring to the end of days where the Antichrist comes and performs miracles and proclaims himself better than Christ. You can see that Luther wasn&#39;t completely certain of his place as questioning the Pope. (Should I cut this out?)&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Also to everyone arguing that the Roman Catholic Church wasn’t a disgrace to God.</p>
<blockquote>Against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest.</blockquote>
<p>Here David is saying that when anyone sins (not just him), it isn’t a sin against man. It is a sin against God.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Got a B+ on the paper. Best grade in the class.</p>

It just jumps right into facts and I find it really boring. Also, the sentence “Martin Luther was taught this too.” - I get what effect you’re trying to achieve with the short sentence, but it doesn’t fit. I’d suggest mixing it with some other sentence or rewording it to fit by itself. Actually, after reading the entire first paragraph and the first sentences of your other paragraphs, your essay looks like a big mess. It doesn’t appear to have an outline, and if it did it was hard to find. Limit your sentences to 5.</p>

The Renaissance wasn’t limited to a single century. It was the 14th century as you stated but also extended into the 15th and iirc the 16th.</p>

<p>Additionally, you seem to have a problem because you are using the wrong words in places.</p>
<p>Example “new” instead of “knew”.</p>

<p>I disagree. In Romans it says, “The just shall live by faith” (1:17)</p>

I have to say if you are pulling some of this information from somewhere and putting it in your own words you need to redo it as your writing style fluctuates rapidly throughout the essay and your teacher will notice this as soon as he or she starts reading it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Where and which parts? I cited information correctly so I’m not plaguerising (&lt;-- butchered that spelling). However, I would like to have a common flow though the paper.</p>
<p>Also, what grade would you guys give it? A-E?[/quote]<br>
That depends on your grade, and class the paper is for.</p>
