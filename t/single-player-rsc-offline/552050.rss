    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/single-player-rsc-offline/552050</link>
    <description>Would anybody be interested in RSC single player (possibly iron-man, too?) that is completely playable without any sort of internet connection? If so I can make this and even port it to Android, and maybe iOS (using RoboVM)?

<p>There are two threads in client, one thread used for connection processing and the main thread(you should stop calling it an applet thread btw) which handles everything from packet handling, game processing, and rendering.</p>
<p>The application would work just fine with single thread only, as the tasks which server does when it comes to playing the game are simple and you don’t need to process more than just the sectors that are being rendered, which is total of 4 sectors.

<p>You only use multiple threads when you want to handle multiple things at same time independently, or without slowing something down, which you don’t really need to do in this case.

Sure it does, but it doesn’t mean the correct way to call the thread is ‘applet thread’. Applet is merely a way to display the game, just like Frame.</p>
<p>Take another look at what the thread does, it has literally nothing to do with applet, therefore ‘applet thread’ is not the correct term.</p>

That client is horribly named…yuck, no wonder you had the assumption that thread is solely for applet.</p>

</aside>
<p>As if those were something that would require another thread… Saving needs to be done upon logout, you clean sectors after loading new ones, loading of characters and data when you press ‘play’, interactions are simple and processing them is fast.</p>
<p>You seem to be stuck thinking of processing lots of players at once. You are only processing one on single player.</p>

<p>The application would work just fine with single thread only, as the tasks which server does when it comes to playing the game are simple and you don’t need to process more than just the sectors that are being rendered, which is total of 4 sectors. That’s very little compared to what server has to do each tick.</p>
<p>You only use multiple threads when you want to handle multiple things at same time independently, or without slowing something down, which you don’t really need to do in this case. But for sake of cleaner code, it might be a good idea and it wouldn’t be a resource hog to do that, unlike you implied.</p>

<p>Nope. The client’s action will be handled by the client itself. There will be no networking library or packets whatsoever.</p>

<p>So the client will load the objects handle all server sided actions inside the client. Well since this has to be multi threaded and may be a resource hog to a phone i say good luck and do it up.<br>

It’s not that big of a resource hog if you do it properly. It’s going to use bit more storage space but that’s it.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to do it properly then it might be an resource hog. For example load all objects, npcs, items etc at once instead of loading just the ones you need to sector that is loaded. You don’t need multiple threads either.[/quote]</p>
<p>I disagree with this because you already have a single thread when the applet loads.</p>
<p>You would then have to keep all client actions within the applet thread and all saving and handling of the “server sided actions” in the same thread. I dunno i just disagree everything being on a single thread.</p>

              <p>Would anybody be interested in RSC single player (possibly iron-man, too?) that is completely playable without any sort of internet connection? If so I can make this and even port it to Android, and maybe iOS (using RoboVM)?</p>
