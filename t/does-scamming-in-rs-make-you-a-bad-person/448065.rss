    <title>Does Scamming in RS make you a bad person?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-scamming-in-rs-make-you-a-bad-person/448065</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sure everybody has scammed at one point, but I just had the opportunity to scam 20m and I felt like shit, so I gave him back his $.

So, if you scammed a guy (friend or not) for 10m-20000b would you feel bad?</description>

i just feel like hacking is forcefully taking their items while scamming they’re handing their items over to you by out-smarting them.</p>

Social Engineering is a form of hacking.<br>

if you can social engineer your way into the account, then congrats.[/quote]<br>
Social engineering is used in scamming. Well, not with the “Doubling money” scam. Retards just spam the chat box.</p>
<p>I’m trying to say that social engineering and scamming are the same. Social engineering and hacking are the same (all social engineering is hacking but not all hacking is social engineering). A+B = B+C, therefore A = C. Scamming is hacking.</p>
