    <title>Hello moparscape mods :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-moparscape-mods/434519</link>
    <description>since when is posting vulgar comments towards a spam bot/advertiser against the rules? it certainly isn&#39;t spamming, it&#39;s completely relevant. i know there is a rule in regards to showing respect to members of the community, but a person like this shouldn&#39;t be considered a part of the community, especially if he/she has 2 posts (that are identical and advertise). it&#39;s not like the comment encourages people to visit said advertised site, in fact it&#39;s a deterrent if anything; hell, it even lets the advertiser know he/she is not welcome. 

i am making this thread not to get the silly 20% warning revoked, but to help the community and myself better understand the rules (therefore shouldn&#39;t be handled privately). in the event that a mod sees this and believe the ruling was unjust (which i do believe it was), feel free to lower the warning for funsies. hell, i even reported the post ;)

yours truly,
t4 &amp; aff</description>

thanks but no I rarely moderate as it is, I just abuse my powers from time to time.</p>
<p>As for the entire topic I always clash with Taharok when it comes to subjects like this, in a perfect world yes everything should be discussed and we should have some sort of unified rules, However this is an online community and out of moderating experience I have found this setup to be rather impossible as it imposes a hell of a lot of work on the “volunteer” mods, the community is very solid usually problems get worked out and we rarely have issues with a moderator “abusing” a member. in the event that you feel a moderator has touched you inappropriately you should first scream “No!” and push the moderator hands away then talk to an adult!

yes, and if you have a problem with it you can bring it up with the moderator not make a post bitching about it. If the moderator is “abusing” you bring it up with an admin.[/quote]</p>

              <p>but that’s the thing there is no unified idea of spam its the moderators decision. also everyone needs to take a step back and understand the term warning its not a punishment its letting you know that a moderator didn’t like what you posted.</p>
<p>as for the mitb / moparscape difference in moderator - absolutely the two communities are not joined they are separated, only the user accounts are joined.</p>

              <p>hm, well thanks for keeping this open - it would have been all too easy for a mod to come along and just lock this <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> . i really do suggest, however that you staffers rework the rules - it’s a little frustrating to see unequal treatment of users and unequal interpretations of the rules, ie what’s acceptable to someone may not be to another; hell, the other side (<a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>) is COMPLETELY different as far as regulation goes.</p>

<p>to be fair, i was mocking the advertiser to demonstrate how poor his english skills were; if he received the hint, he would understand to post his link in a fashion that provides a question about the site towards the community that provokes discussion. it may have been unreasonably implicit, but the truthful meaning was there</p>
<p>ps i’m still unsure of what spam is - as i stated, i had no negative intentions in my post. i assume that spam is anything off-topic that doesn’t regard the topic at hand (which is still considerably vague and isn’t even stated in the community rules), but can you please clarify this for me? i would more than likely be willing to cease my not-so-helpful “spam” if you could give me a proper definition of what spam is. thanks</p>

<p>every person has a different idea of what spam is. it would be helpful for the community if we could get a statement from someone that provides us with a universal definition of what flame/spam/useful posts are</p>

<p>after carefully looking at the rules, what is spam? can you clarify that? it’s pretty vague.</p>

              <p>since when is posting vulgar comments towards a spam bot/advertiser against the rules? it certainly isn’t spamming, it’s completely relevant. i know there is a rule in regards to showing respect to members of the community, but a person like this shouldn’t be considered a part of the community, especially if he/she has 2 posts (that are identical and advertise). it’s not like the comment encourages people to visit said advertised site, in fact it’s a deterrent if anything; hell, it even lets the advertiser know he/she is not welcome.</p>
<p>i am making this thread not to get the silly 20% warning revoked, but to help the community and myself better understand the rules (therefore shouldn’t be handled privately). in the event that a mod sees this and believe the ruling was unjust (which i do believe it was), feel free to lower the warning for funsies. hell, i even reported the post <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
