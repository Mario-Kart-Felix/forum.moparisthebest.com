    <description>Hello, my server is based on dodian, devolutionv7.

In order to make my server more fun, i wanted to make half the world wild, so when people go on that side they can be killed by anyone, and when there not on there side, there safe.

here is an idea of what i want, So how would i go about doing this, please explain in detail because im a beginner. thankyou

also, i tried looking for public boolean nonWild()  in the client file, and nothing poped up. can someone download devolution v7 and see if they can find it? thanks, also who ever helps me will get admin status and ill give you 10$ via paypal. thanks</description>
