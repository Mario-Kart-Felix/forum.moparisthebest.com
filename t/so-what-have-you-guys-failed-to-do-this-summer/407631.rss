              <p>The only thing I failed to finish this summer was my game engine (ran into performance problems that I’m still working out). Anyways, yea, the next thing on my agenda, is me and my gf are debating on having a child. There are some issues that came up from the past that may render her unable, but we are waiting for a confirmation.</p>
<p>Anyways, my summer list was as follows:<br>
[ul][li]Catch up with my old friends now that I’m back in Mississippi[/li]<br>
[li]Find a gf (this was the fastest and easiest)[/li]<br>
[li]Buy a motorcycle (I now have 3?)[/li]<br>
[li]Get motorcycle license[/li]<br>
[li]Finish the API on my game engine (as mentioned, ran into performance issues, so I’ve been optimizing code)[/li]<br>
[li]Learn more Java &amp; C#  (like i couldn’t do this any time?, I have no idea why I had this on my list)[/li][/ul]</p>

Well I was suppose to try this juice diet thing where I drink just juices from a juicer for 10 days. Was really looking forward too it but then I got really sick and couldn’t keep much down.<br>

Not eating is a shit way to lose weight, because you put it straight back on when you decide to start eating. Just stop having snacks especially juring the night because you cant lose that weight when you sleep. Breakfast is essential for losing weight, after all it gives you the energy to get out and lose that extra weight.</p>
<p>Breakfast: Cereal or something simple like toast<br>
Lunch: A sammy, Muesli Bar and maybe a low fat Yohgurt<br>
Dinner: Mixed veges (personally mixed veges taste a lot better than single Broccoli), and some sort of Meat.</p>
<p>I always have 8 cups of water per day, it’s suppose to help you lose.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Fizzy drinks also have a shit load of sugar in them, energy drinks are even worse.[/quote]<br>
Oh, no I should have phrased that better. It’s not a diet to lose weight (I’m under weight), its like a detox thing, my doctor suggested it cause I’m being treated for stomach ulcers and would help build up my body’s defenses to be able to heal myself faster. The juice combinations are hearty and give me almost 5 times my daily value of almost all vitamins and fiber.</p>
