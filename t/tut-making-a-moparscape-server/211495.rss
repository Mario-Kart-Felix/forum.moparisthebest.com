    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tut-making-a-moparscape-server/211495</link>
    <description>Ok so this is the RIGHT way to make a server. none of that &quot;enter this adress in your html box&quot;. so heres what you do.

Chapter 1 - Getting JDK
Chapter 2 - Getting No-IP
Chapter 3 - Opening port 43594
Chapter 4 - Small Modifications

 ------------
| Chapter 1 |
 ------------
First we need JDK 6.
Download it here - http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
Click JDK 6 Update 6, you will get a popup, click Yes.
Check the box &#39;I agree&#39; and click on one of the 2 downloads you can choose and install it.


 ------------
| Chapter 2|
 ------------
You can download No-IP from the official site.
Go to the official site by going here - http://no-ip.org/
Click on the register tab and register an account.
If you are there click the Downloads tab.


In this tutorial I will teach everything for windows.
So click on Windows.
Now click on the link/image to download.com and you can download and install it through that page.

Once you installed No-IP you will have a button on your desktop to run it.
Run it and your No-IP will open.

On the bottom you see I made one part a little bit red with a low opacity.
Click the &#39;Here&#39; to add a new IP.
Let the page load and you will see this button somewhere.

Click on it to add an IP.
This page will have 2 Fields.
Hostname information and E-Mail settings.
Just ignore the E-Mail field.
The Hostname field will look like this.


At the first text field fill in your server name.
Click on the image to view the list of domains you can choose, or if your already on that real page you can see it also.
The Ip Address part will auto change to your IP, do not change it.
Once you&#39;re done click &#39;Create Host&#39; at the bottom and click the &#39;Refresh&#39; at the No-IP Menu on your computer.


 ------------
| Chapter 3|
 ------------
Now To open up 43594

this is the easy way to do it.
go to ipchicken.com and copy that number and paste it in your web adress box.
then it should ask you for your user and pass.

Username - Admin
Password - Admin

Then when u get there, go to the tab &quot;Applications &amp; Gaming&quot;

Then go to the tab thats a bit lower &quot;Port Range Forwarding&quot;

then in the Start~End Boxes, put 43954 in both of them. do this to two boxes.
then in one box for the protocol, put &quot;TCP&quot;
In the other one put &quot;UDP&quot;
Now the last box. to get it, go to Start/Run
Search CMD
then a box should come up. type in IPconfig
then a list of numbers should come up.
look at the top last 3 numbers and remember thoes. enter thoes in the last box in the &quot;PRF&quot; Tab (Port Range Forwarding)

Now make sure &quot;Enabled&quot; is checked.

oh yea i almost forgot. the name of it is your server name.

 -------------
| Chapter 3.5|
 -------------

Getting A Source

go to http://www.sythe.org/showthread.php?t=269825

for a HUUUUUUUUGE list of sources.

Pick one and download it.

 -----------
| Chapter 4|
 -----------

Now copy the file to your desktop and open it.

Go to &quot;compile&quot; and right click and edit

erace everything and put:

@echo off
color 0a
title Server Compiler
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_06\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . *.java
pause


Now in &quot;Runserver&quot;, edit and put:

@echo off
COLOR 0a
title RunServer
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.17-ga-bin.jar server

now in the Title, you can put whatever you want, but make sure &quot;title&quot; is still there.

Now, ENJOY YOUR SERVER!
