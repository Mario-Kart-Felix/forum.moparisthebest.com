    <title>Wired internet doesn&#39;t work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wired-internet-doesnt-work/258037</link>
    <description>So my copy of windows xp no longer works for some reason, so I installed windows 7 (build 7000). My laptop is running it and runs it smoothly but on my desktop the wired Internet does not work. My wireless network still works otherwise I could not post this. My system sorts detects the hardware but won&#39;t detect it so I can install the drivers. It first tells me that it&#39;s detected but no drivers, I go to install the drivers and not detected. Help?</description>

<p>Yeah, it’s still in beta; and it’s extremely buggy, which would explain this situation.  Stick with your wireless internet, or switch operating systems.</p>
