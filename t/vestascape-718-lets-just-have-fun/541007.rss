    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vestascape-718-lets-just-have-fun/541007</link>
    <description>VestaScape 718 is going to be a project that I plan on making to help myself and learn and create and try to see how far I can push myself, I don&#39;t plan on ever making this a server I will release one day but for now, this is purely for self purpose. I plan on adding things, such as Construction, Minigames, Point Systems, Quests. The list goes on.... Input, ideas and support would be greatly appreciated!
