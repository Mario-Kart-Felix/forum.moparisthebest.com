    <title>I was deleting some of my old servers and something is wrong-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-was-deleting-some-of-my-old-servers-and-something-is-wrong/125167</link>
    <description>Okay, I had like 10 servers that I used to use, but don&#39;t use anymore, so I was deleting them and when I got to Phonescape, I put it in the trash bin and a message popped up that said that it cannot delete it because one of the characters was not specified or w\e... so I go into the characters folder and try to change the name of the character to a .txt but it doesn&#39;t work.. Here is was happens when I double click the character..

Anyone know what&#39;s wrong?? :confused:</description>
