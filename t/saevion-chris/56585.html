        <p>I cant believe I am writing this post. Some of the people who knew chris are still around, afaik you are all still using his code - he was never a part of this community but he was part of rscn and other groups. He was a great guy, a great friend and he vanished. I have been looking for him since, and today I was looking for him again and found the worst possible news.</p>
<p>Chris passed away on the 30th of novemember 2005. At the moment I am unsure what caused his death, it is not important at this time anyway.</p>
<p>This is no joke, no hoak, no bullshit. I was reading through old chatlogs I found which I hadnt checked before for information on how to try and find him, he had given me his dads alias once, and his email - RESULT - I googled his dads alias and found this post.</p>
<blockquote>Hello all,
<p>I have a unique problem…I hate to admit it here, but I am a Windows man…LOL</p>
<p>But, my son was an dedicated Linux person…Unfortunately, he died on November 30th, 2005…And within his comp is some info I need to let his friends know what happened to him…</p>
<p>When I fire up his machine, I see, “Loading GRUB v 5.1”, then it recognizes all of his attached hardware, then just a prompt…</p>
<p>Any suggestions? All I want is to access to his IRC to pass the word…Can I load Windows next to Linux, without disturbing his old info? Then access his IRC?</p>
<p>I am at my wits end…would hate to reformat the drive and install Windows and lose everythijg that was my son in there…</p>
<p>BTW, my son’s name was Chris Cobb, screen name “Saeveon” or somethoing similar…I am specifically looking for a “Sean” who lives in Scotland…there’s probably only 2 million Seans there, so…</p>
<p>If anyone knew my son, or this Sean, please contact me ASAP, either here, or at </p>
<p>I know it’s a longshot, but what else can I do?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance…</p>

<p>This was posted by his father on 01-12-2006, 12:26 AM. I have only just found this message, I wish I had found it sooner. I have contacted his father and I will inform him of this post, to let him know that the people that knew him here finally know what has happened. Please, dont spam this thread or act like retards - and please lets not have everyone emailing his dad. I almost feel bad that I have contacted him as this will no doubt bring up all the feelings and emotions associated with this.</p>
<p>A site has been made in his honour by his real life friends, <a href="http://halo62682.tripod.com/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://halo62682.tripod.com/index.html</a>.</p>
<p>I will always miss chris, he was one of the best friends I have ever had online.</p>
<p>[glow=red,2,300]UPDATE[/glow]</p>
<p>I have heard back from bill (that is chris’ dad). He died of natural causes.</p>
<p>This has been hard on his family, very hard . It was so unexpected, it was so unjust. Chris had alot of years and potential in him. I am going to make my own memorial to him, I have contacted the constructor of the original memorial site about this - I want to do this for him - I need to do this for him. I cant believe that I was the one that was seeked out, thats such an honour. I was the one they wanted to contact, it really touches me. And this whole situation has hit me hard. He was my best friend back then, and I thought I exhausted every way to try and contact him. If I hadnt of logged chats, we still wouldnt know.</p>
<p>But we know now, and althou it is not what we wanted to hear - we atleast have some closure.</p>
<p>Bill wants anyone who wants to get in touch with him to do so, so ignore my inital comment of not contacting him. I was not sure how sensative the subject was with him, it is very hard for him, I know that for a fact. But he wants to hear anything you want to say, and I respect him for that. I AM going to keep in contact with bill, it feels right and he seems to feel the same.</p>
<p>He has several emails but he reads them all, the 2 I know of are <a href="mailto:bill.cobb@gmail.com">bill.cobb@gmail.com</a> and <a href="mailto:mlsbill44@hotmail.com">mlsbill44@hotmail.com</a> .</p>
<p>This is one of the saddest stories I have ever heard, and I send all of my love to chris’ family. He had 1 brother 1 sister and 2 half sisters. His mum was his best friend and he was very close to his dad and step mother. And dont forget his parrot!  I cannot contemplate how hard it must be for them, I knew chris for a short time and he touched me so much in that period. If he could of only lived longer…</p>
<p>[glow=red,2,300]IMPORTANT POINT[/glow]</p>
<p>Could an admin please stick this? This is an imporant thread about a well loved member. After over a year of not knowing what happened to chris, I want no one else to endure that any longer.</p>
<p>^^ this has now been done, thanks kbm - you logged off before I could thank you.</p>
<p>[glow=red,2,300]MORE IMPORTANT INFO[/glow]<br>
I now have boosted powers for this thread, I can delete and censor ALL of your posts - AND all of the staff are watching this thread. Act like a twat == removed and serious consequences. So dont try and act like an idiot to get your name known, it will do the exact opposite.</p>
<p><img src="http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/7849/img025jpgw300h441tm3.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Always remembered, never forgotten.</p>
<p>^^ Fixed the lame tripod stuff.</p>
<p>[glow=red,2,300]Message from bill (chris’ father)[/glow]</p>
<p>Bill has decided not to be come to the vFuneral if/when it takes place. Below is a message bill would like to share with everyone.</p>
<blockquote>To everyone on the 'Mopar' site:
<p>Hello to everyone,</p>
<p>I am Bill Cobb, Chris’ (Saevion’s) father. I have been following the thread started by Sean all weekend. I honestly don’t have the words to express how touched and moved I am for all of the kind words and thoughts. Although it has been over a year since his passing, I still grieve and cry every day. I must thank you all from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I didn’t try harder than I did to try to find you all. I am so happy and relieved that Sean came across one of the posts I had left out there. There is a bit of closure for me to know that his friends have finally gotten the news.</p>
<p>When Chris died, I turned into a ‘basket case’. I was all I could do to just want to wake up in the morning. There were several times when I considered ‘joining’ him…Chris was my first-born child, the eldest of five wonderful children. Somehow, I knew that he wouldn’t have wanted me to do that. Maybe, just maybe, this was why…</p>
<p>I understand that Sean is organizing a vFuneral in RS for Chris. I think that is a wonderful idea, and I encourage all who knew, or heard of him to try to get there. Chris would have gotten a kick out of it, I’m sure.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>I have decided not to attend. My wife (His step-mom, Nise) and his step-sister (Sammi) may attend. Please understand that this is not out of any disrespect for any of you. When Chris died, I had my funeral for him, and grieved as a father should, with family and close friends there.</p>
<p>This is your hour. Where his friends can get together and console each other. I should not be a part of that. I was not involved with you when Chris was alive, I should not intrude and possibly take any focus away in this memorial to him. I ask only one thing: Please don’t get into a ‘grief fest’ (I have cried enough tears for us all…). Celebrate his life and any influance he may have had on you personally or by association.</p>
<p>Chris introduced me to the concept of ‘open source’, and all of the implications. I respect what you do, and what you stand for. To Chris, it was never ‘cheating’, just an alternative solution…</p>
<p>I am proud and honored to find such a respectful community of folks that Chris was associated with. A father always worries ‘what kind of crowd’ his son hangs around with…Well, I have no worries on that matter…</p>
<p>To close: Again, Thank you all for being so kind…You are the sort of person/people that Chris was…To everyone who has emailed my privetely: Thanks, and I WILL answer all, just give me a day or two to get my thoughts straight. To Sean and Jason: Well…you know how I feel…TY…</p>
<p>I am able to go to sleep each night knowing that the last words I heard from my son were, “I love you, Pop. I’ll see you tomorrow”…And the last thing I said to him was, “I love you too, son. Have a good night”. Please, please, try to say that to the ones that are important in your life.</p>
<p>For Chris, through Chris, thank you all, and I love you all as I did my son.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Bill</p>

Live every day as if it's your last, as in his case, I don't think he saw it coming :(
<p>Offtopic (maybe insensitive): I was looking for him to help me with his deobber, no wonder I couldn’t find him. Noone else knew where he was either.</p>

        <p>I’m actually pretty stunned by this. I never really knew Saev, although he was about IRC occaisionally and I spoke to him a few times, and of course we’re still using his code now, so he definitely helped the community out. I always assumed he just got bored of “the scene” like many others.</p>

        <p>NO… No… I almost dropped a tear while reading the beginning :<br>
He was such a smart and talented guy. He has always been one of my idols, even though I can’t explain why…<br>
(and no, not because of his deobfuscator, and yes, I have been in “the scene” for a few years, so I do know about him)</p>

        <p>Well this came as a shock, hit me quite hard. I remember talking to him on IRC, iirc sucking up to him :P, good times eh? Well, I wish you all the best with the big fella up there man, rest in peace. I just can’t believe the last time I spoke to him was pre november 2005, it seems like only a few months back… ah well.</p>
<p>Good bye “Saev”, rest in peace.</p>

<p>Edit: I would just like to add, in reading the news paper article about his funeral arrangements it quotes: “He passed away peacefully in his sleep.” I guess, if anything this is the best concelation, if there really is one.</p>

        <p>I didnt personally know him, but I know the things has done. He revived RS Cheating with his Deobfuscator, and didnt keep it private. Its a shame he had to leave so early, when he had already accomplished so much. R.I.P</p>
