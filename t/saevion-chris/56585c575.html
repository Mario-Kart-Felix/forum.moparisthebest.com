        <p>I never knew Chris, but he seems to have been a really talented and bright guy. He helped many people, made numerous friends, and contributed to Runescape cheating. I fell sorry for his family, especially his father and his dear friends. I hope you guys, the friends, have memories of him, which you can cherish in your heart for the rest of your life. Shed tears if they need to be shed, there is no harm in that…you are just sympathizing your friend’s death.</p>
<p>Life doesn’t always turn out how we want/expect it to…you have to make the best of it. I hope Chris (Saevion) did.</p>

        <hr>
<p>Unfortunately, Chris died without any of us expecting it. Chris was my brother, Im sure most of you knew him as Saevion, but here he was just Chris. He was a whiz at the computer and an amazing guy. I still remember that day, like it was yesterday.<br>
I was in science class, when I got the yellow ‘Go home’ slip. When I went to the office and saw my mom,  I knew something was wrong by the way she looked. When we were ome, My mom and dad called both Michaela (My younger sister) and I in and told us.<br>
At first, it was a shock, like a prank. But soon we started to realize it waqs no joke. Chris has actually died.<br>
I never got to know Chris all that much, I mean he gave me rides to school, we talked, he even taught me some moves with a soccerball. He was really good at that also. But, we never bonded. I am devistated still, as well my dad, Bill. Each day we try to get through it, and it seems to be getting easier and easier. Sean, or anyone else, I would love to talk. I dont mind talking about Chris because it sometimes gets hard with my dad on an emotional rollercoaster. So Please keep in touch I’d appreciate it. My emails are <a href="mailto:sam070613@yahoo.com">sam070613@yahoo.com</a>, <a href="mailto:sammi.cobb@gmail.com">sammi.cobb@gmail.com</a>,and/or <a href="mailto:junebugsam@hotmail.com">junebugsam@hotmail.com</a></p>

Unfortunately, Chris died without any of us expecting it. Chris was my brother, Im sure most of you knew him as Saevion, but here he was just Chris. He was a whiz at the computer and an amazing guy. I still remember that day, like it was yesterday.<br>
I was in science class, when I got the yellow ‘Go home’ slip. When I went to the office and saw my mom,  I knew something was wrong by the way she looked. When we were ome, My mom and dad called both Michaela (My younger sister) and I in and told us.<br>
At first, it was a shock, like a prank. But soon we started to realize it waqs no joke. Chris has actually died.<br>
I never got to know Chris all that much, I mean he gave me rides to school, we talked, he even taught me some moves with a soccerball. He was really good at that also. But, we never bonded. I am devistated still, as well my dad, Bill. Each day we try to get through it, and it seems to be getting easier and easier. Sean, or anyone else, I would love to talk. I dont mind talking about Chris because it sometimes gets hard with my dad on an emotional rollercoaster. So Please keep in touch I’d appreciate it.

<p>Sam[/quote] I’m so sory for you and your family <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning1bce.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I’m realy feeling emotional now… This all went so fast… We knew nothing about him, and now … :’( :’( :’( :’( I don’t think anyone has done more for the world of Private Servers than he did. I hope people will realise we lost a “Leader”, a “Hero”. We may not, and we WILL never forget what he did and who he was. I realy felt down all day, and I’m affraid I will feel down for couple of days… I’m not going to say I know what you and your family are feeling. Just because I don’t. I lost family members too, but I never lost a brother. I am feeling with you. If you need anything, plz ask !</p>

        <p>Jens , Ty so much. It means alot. He truly was a hero, In all that he did. We all love and miss him greatly. He was a great guy and deserved to live, he had great potntial that could have led him to powerful and amazing things that would have helped the world. I used to believe there was nothing he really couldn’t do. But, he is gone. And that in all is a great shame</p>

That made me tear, since I can relate on how my dad died when I was five (fifteen now). It really makes me thing and it brings back memories of him, I definitely know how you and your family feel right now. I felt the same as you did when I heard my dad died, since I was five, I thought it was all just a big joke, then I thought he was hiding for a bit, then I came to realize he was really gone. Although I’ve never lost a brother, I know that losing family hurts.</p>
<p>After a few years finding some online people that finally find out that he died must be hard on you, because it brings back memories. . . and that day. I’m glad that you don’t mind talking about him, that’s a good thing. All I really have to say is good luck to you and your family, he really was a great young man.</p>

<p>It does hurt when people die :(. Some people seem to think, in a few months, that’s it, your over it, get over it. Its really not the case, my dad died 3 years ago now, and yet its hard to believe that that amount of time has really passed. Tis very hard, and i am very sorry :(.</p>
<p>Your brother, influenced so many people. In so many positive ways. A lot of us would not be where we are now were it not for him. There are many people here, whom have benefited Chris’s. So many of us cant explain through words how thankful we are to him. Chris certainly helped inspire me. He was a great person. If there is anything that i can do, in anyway, feel free to call on me.</p>
<p>Condolences to you and your whole family x</p>

        <p>Aight, a memorial will be held ingame. Most likely tomorow depending on how bad the notice is. As far as the time goes it will have to be after sam(chris’ sister) gets home from school I think. I know its short notice but nise(chris’ step mother) works nights and has monday off.</p>
<p>So stick around for an update on the time and server and directions to the location.</p>
