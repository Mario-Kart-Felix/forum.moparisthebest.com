<p>We’re always looking for suitable staff members, they’re incredibly hard to pick because of the high expectations we hold. Alongside the fact that many of the people who visit here don’t read the rules and often gives us work that we really didn’t need. I often log on to over 15/20 reports and then continue doing the ones that pop up during my time online, it can easily lead to each active moderator doing over 25~ reports a day. It’s just a shame that a good amount of the active members are so trolly or have already retired from their positions. It’s just one of those things, I suppose.<br>
[/quote]I’m more interested in knowing how many times a staff position was turned down  :P[/quote]<br>
From what I know, hardly ever. The only one I can remember of was Lin turning down global when he was offered it like a year ago.</p>

That’s nothing to do with us, that’s a community who have either too many past (recent past) discrepancies with us and it turns the current staff biased against them therefore they don’t get approved. If the community refuses to mature and keep a flame-free posting environment with minimal trolling then there isn’t much we can do in the way of staff other than continue doing what we do.</p>

        <p>Lol, in other words the staff here aren’t capable of improving this site much more? The blame game is always fun. Personally, I blame the head (?) staff because they have power to make things happen. Communities form over time, staff can change how the community is shaped and who are staff.</p>
<p>Theirs no point in blaming the community. It’s like blaming a child for being annoying. If you don’t want the kid to be annoying you try to shape them into less of an annoying child (i.e. telling them it’s bad to do certain things); the same as how you’d mould your community as best as possible to what you want. If the staff can’t mould them then the staff is the one that’s failing.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as that, this isn’t a verbal attack on staff like some idiots would think; it’s just a fact about how the way things are atm. I’m not saying it’s easy to mould communities but people on the site make it sound like an impossible task.</p>

<p>For once…I agree with the staff on this instead of you. You would have to know about lweb development to even fathom what would have to occur. Myself I don’t know a whole lot but even I know that I wouldn’t want to be in charge of doing this.</p>
<p>We should also remember that these are people with full time jobs who come home and moderate/administrate/program for the community. You can’t expect them to take hours on end every day to do something like this.</p>
<p>As far as the specifics I would leave that to a web dev person to explain what would happen…</p>
<p>and Ruby is correct. Why do you think Flame_ was promoted? He is new-ish but he was mature all at the same time so kudos to him. Somebody like me will never change and that’s alright with me. But what Ruby has stated is entirely true. The only person in the community who I have seen change really any/majorly is probably arham and that’s really more of him maturing overall. He still has a way to go through as well.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s against the rules to flame, so are you saying that unless users abide by the rules then there’s nothing nothing that the staff can do?</p>
<p>There are a number of things you can do. You can enforce the rules more. Instead of just deleting/locking threads actually use the warn feature. There hasn’t been a single infraction handed out for 4 days now, which given your “15/20 reports a day” statistic, there have been at least 60 reports which haven’t been acted upon using the infraction system. The system fits in place well and is useful -  I know for a fact that people are more likely to stop what they doing if they get a PM from the “Staff team” telling them exactly what they did wrong.</p>
<p>You could also start by enforcing the rules more evenly. There are a lot of members on here who get punished harshly, despite the fact that a lot of “veterans” on the site routinely go around flaming everyone they come into contact with. If anything, the veterans should be punished harshly so that they get their head out of their arse and learn that if they have nothing constructive to say, they should refrain from posting.</p>
<p>The staff team are nowhere near as powerless as you are making out. You make the entire ruleset of the forum and you can permanently remove any member who deviates from them. In fact, you just have the power to permanently remove any member regardless of what they’ve done.  If there truly is a band of rampant thuggish trolls roaming the forum, flaming and insulting everyone they encounter - punish them!</p>

        <p>Ambokile you wouldn’t know how reported posts are acted upon. The majority of them are just topics in the wrong section. Right now there are 14 reported posts to be reviewed and not one of them is for flaming. I’m not about to start infracting new members posting in the wrong section their first time.</p>

<p>We’re always looking for suitable staff members, they’re incredibly hard to pick because of the high expectations we hold. Alongside the fact that many of the people who visit here don’t read the rules and often gives us work that we really didn’t need. I often log on to over 15/20 reports and then continue doing the ones that pop up during my time online, it can easily lead to each active moderator doing over 25~ reports a day. It’s just a shame that a good amount of the active members are so trolly or have already retired from their positions. It’s just one of those things, I suppose.<br>

<p>[quote]Lol, in other words the staff here aren’t capable of improving this site much more? The blame game is always fun.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For once…I agree with the staff on this instead of you. You would have to know about lweb development to even fathom what would have to occur. Myself I don’t know a whole lot but even I know that I wouldn’t want to be in charge of doing this.</p>
<p>We should also remember that these are people with full time jobs who come home and moderate/administrate/program for the community. You can’t expect them to take hours on end every day to do something like this.</p>
<p>As far as the specifics I would leave that to a web dev person to explain what would happen…</p>
<p>and Ruby is correct. Why do you think Flame_ was promoted? He is new-ish but he was mature all at the same time so kudos to him. Somebody like me will never change and that’s alright with me. But what Ruby has stated is entirely true. The only person in the community who I have seen change really any/majorly is probably arham and that’s really more of him maturing overall. He still has a way to go through as well.[/quote]<br>
In my opinion their is three roads you can go down. 1 = You can modify the site, 2 =  you can modify the community &amp; 3 = both.<br>
I believe if enough time and effort is invested both site modification [1] and community modification [2] (to an extent) can be successfully completed. We all know their are many talented staff members and helpful users on this site, the only two issues stopping people actually doing things is motivation (i.e. a incentive to spend hours doing something purely for moparscape) and time.</p>
<p>I don’t expect staff to work to that much of an extent i.e. I expect lower end staff members to moderate professionally when they are actually on moparscape; I won’t discuss other categories of staff atm. Maybe it seems like I expect head (?) staff to go above and beyond… Well, to improve this site one of the things that is needed is time; if they cannot provide it, they are failing at their job. The reason to why I’m not ‘attacking’ staff is this post (and the last) is because I never thought of them as doing wrong in this respect, I’m just saying their not doing as much of them is required.<br>
To put it simply in an example:<br>
Your at a organisation you volunteered for. You get given a task to complete which takes 12 hours to complete however, you said you’d only come in for 10 hours and they agreed to that. You decide to leave after the originally agreed 10 hours.<br>
The fact is the task isn’t finished however, you have met the agreed time value though.<br>
^That’s what I’m getting at. Staff shouldn’t be blaming the community if the real issue is because they don’t want to invest more of their time into the site; they aren’t wrong for not wanting to invest more of their time into the site but they are wrong if they think it’s OK to fiddle their thumbs and play the blame game.</p>
<p>Lots of people have changed on this site, it’s just hard to just pick up on notable changes/characteristics related to members of this community; a lot of the good staff material don’t actually interact with the community that much.<br>
Their is a lot of potential good staff on this site, it’s just people tend not to portray themselves in that way if they are good staff.<br>
But meh, that’s just my two cents.</p>

</aside>
<p>If I haven’t seen much progress excuse me for not realising something’s being done. All I have seen is a few new sections + a few new staff in the past like six months (?). Ruby ruby ruby… ‘don’t understand’ and ‘don’t know’ have two completely different meanings. Don’t understand is an indirect insult, because our views clash your going to claim I cannot comprehend something? Understanding and agreeing with someone are also two completely different things; I understand what your saying but I don’t agree with it. Also, I do know about the weekly meeting.</p>
<p>It’s my own ranking. I’m not ranking them based upon how I view them as people, I’m basing them on how much they can do on this site. The more power someone has, the more important they are to the site in my opinion just like in real life like how the prime minister is ‘more important’ than a begger; people don’t like to admit it but it’s true - that is life.<br>
Don’t get offended because in this situation I’m ranking the staff in this mannerism, it’s more of a categorisation - it’s a lot faster than specifying staff names.</p>
<p>It is possible, your just not capable of finding the correct people for the job. I realize finding good quality staff isn’t easy however, that’s exactly why you guys aren’t capable in this <span class="bbcode-b">current situation</span>. I believe their are people that are capable here but they are just hard to find, if you believe their aren’t many people here that are capable you really do think lowly of this community. People’s attitudes change drastically depending on the situation, if your going to decide who are good potential staff just by the way they are in general you immediately throw out a lot of potential people. Your a good example of this: you are pretty immature at times even with your current role (which is acceptable) but by your own logic you shouldn’t be staff (I’m not saying you should or shouldn’t, I’m just saying by your own logic). Remember the website you released? + You’ve stated two indirect insults in your post without any reason to do so apart from that I disagree with you.<br>
It’s clear to me the issue isn’t the value of potential good staff on this site (their could be more ofc…), it’s the way they are picked.<br>
I’m not expecting anything. I’m just saying my view on it which most of the staff won’t like because it’s not worded in a way that compliments people so people by nature won’t like my opinion. I’ve not worded my posts in a way that insults people but people assume they are being insulted because they fit into a category they don’t like.</p>
<p>All in all, your ears are closed to me and mine is closed to you (you may believe yours aren’t but they are, if they weren’t and mine weren’t we’d find some common ground somewhere which we did not).  We both believe the root of the problem is completely different from each other and we both believe we are correct which makes this discussion (?) pointless.</p>

        <p>Dont say that telling someone something is bad means they won’t do it anymore. I work as a Correctional Officer. Yes, I’m admitting it at the cost of my job now just to make my point. I will use JUST today as an example. An inmate while being escorted to the kitchen dinning hall decided to run to a buildings window to talk to his friend really fast. I’ve told him 3 times already that he can get an attempted escape charge for that and 5 years added. Needless to say today I had to write him up. He worked and had a job at the prison.Today, he lost all pprivledges, and his job. He is now on lockdown because he wouldn’t listen. You cannot change people. A person can only change themselves when they want too. Yes, you can make the aware, whether they want to act on that is entirely on them.</p>
<p>Enforcing change can only go so far. If you go all police mode super strick it causes problems, be to relaxed and you have problems. The hard part is finding someone who is mature, and would actually do their job without favoritism and keep their daily mood’s separate from the sites infraction system. I see it all to often at work when a fellow CO shows up in a bad mood, all of the inmates catch hell, creating even more problems.</p>
<p>All I can say is good luck and let’s try to get back on topic <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Maybe it should be like for every thank you put on a post, you should post a reason why. and if staff want to randomly check in on thanks and see that a thank was given out of the arse and the comment left was like “thanked bcuz yolo” then the thank could be removed, and possibly an infraction given for abusing the system. just a thought.</p>

<p>But why?</p>
<p>[ol][li]Regulating thanks systems puts too much works on moderators.[/li]<br>
[li]Abusing the system? If the infractions is man-judged, then it’s opinionated. One moderator can thing that its a good reason to thank. Another mod can think its out of the arse.[/li][/ol]</p>
