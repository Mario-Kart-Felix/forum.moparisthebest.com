    <title>Cant download on my mac?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-download-on-my-mac/370996</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I want to start by apologizing if this is the wrong section or if i missed a post solving this somewhere. I played moparscape about a year ago and back then i used hamachi and i just downloaded moparscape. Now i have a apple macbook pro and i have no idea what exactly to do. I have tried to download 3.2 and it wont let me log into any server at all. In addition i have tried going to the 4.1 and if it does log me in it will kick me out and said t2... and so on. I am very confused and dont know what i hve done wrong. If it were a dell, toshiba etc i could figure it out i believe but being i have a mac im completely lost:[. Please let me know a solution to this. Thank you</description>

              <p>Alot of server will throw the T2 error because of customization to their client. More specifically, people using Bluurr’s client as a base, and a few others laying around. To use the moparscape client you will need to find a server that is closer to Allstar, rather than the average server around. I suggest just finding a server that has a client download for it, would make it much easier.</p>
