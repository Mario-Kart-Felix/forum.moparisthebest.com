    <description>Yes, I&#39;ve read through the section in the Java tutorial but I&#39;m still having trouble really understanding it. All I really understand about it is that it&#39;s like multiple threads running at the same time, etc, but is there more to it?</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>You seem to understand the gist of it. Concurrency is when two things are happening at one time. This is done through threads. One thread may be assigned to handling something like game IO, where another might have the responsibility of rendering the game. There are infinite ways to apply concurrency, but you must do it correctly. If you use multiple threads wrong, you are going to run into a wall of problems.</p>
