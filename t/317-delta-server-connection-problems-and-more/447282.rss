    <title>[317] [Delta] Server connection problems (and more?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-server-connection-problems-and-more/447282</link>
    <description>I just started setting up my first server two days ago, but last night I went to connect to the server (set up on no-ip) and it simply did not connect.  After four to five hours of checking every guide I could find, checking all the files that were connection related (both server and client), my friends were breathing down my neck to mess around on the server so I decided to just launch the vanilla source and client with Hamachi, but the default source and client would not connect to each other.  The plain client said I was IP banned...

  What is this I don&#39;t even
