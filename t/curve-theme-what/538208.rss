    <title>Curve Theme - What?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/curve-theme-what/538208</link>
    <description>So, I wasn&#39;t sure where exactly I should put this thread, but I&#39;d like to let this be known.

Out of random, it appears as if it has started today, the Curve theme started being a bit off. The Mopar logo container would expand itself to be the size of an advertisement, making the thread container quite small. I wasn&#39;t sure if it had anything to do with the advertisements on the website, so I decided to install Adblock Plus to see if any change would occur. It did not. I&#39;m not sure if this is happening to anyone else, or if it&#39;s just my browser. My Chrome started acting funny a few days ago, so that may have to do with it. If you do not understand what I&#39;m going on about, here&#39;s a picture:

I&#39;m not entirely sure what&#39;s going on with it, but I will try other browsers and see if it effects them the same way.

EDIT:
The exact same on Firefox as well.</description>

I prefer the Curve theme over the default theme, but I can’t stand to look at it like that. It loads up just fine, but when it loads additional advertisements, it expands the Mopar logo container to be the exact size of the advertisements.</p>
