    <description>This is for the falador ladders in general store
I am to the point where I need help I cannot figure out the rest.

This is what I have:

[code]        case 11741:
            if (obX == 2954 &amp;&amp; obY == 3389) {
                c.getPA().object(3562, 3389, 11741, 0, 1);
                c.getPA().movePlayer(2954, 3388, 2);
            } else if (obX == 2954 &amp;&amp; obY == 3390) {
                c.getPA().object(2954, 3390, 11741, -1, 0);
                c.getPA().movePlayer(2955, 3390, 1);
            } else if (obX == 2954 &amp;&amp; obY == 3389 &amp;&amp; c.heightLevel == 1) {
                c.getPA().object(2954, 3389, 11741, 0, -1);
                c.getPA().movePlayer(2954, 3390, 0);
            } else if (obX == 2954 &amp;&amp; obY == 3390) {
                c.getPA().object(3558, 3390, 11741, 0, -1);
                c.getPA().movePlayer(2954, 3390, 0);
            }

            break;[/code]

The problematic one is the one that i added &quot;&amp;&amp; c.heightLevel == 1&quot; to the code.

I was wondering if you could do somthing like this:  c.heightLevel == 1
But the aforementioned does not work, so is there some way that i can still do c.heightLevel == 1?
because it would be the most accurate way to do it that i can think of.


Thanks, Austen</description>

<p>Yeah the building has three floors</p>
