    <description>okay, so i have a server and when i try to run it with everything, it runs and when i use the local ip (127.0.0.1) it works and i can get on.
but when i use my server ip ********.no-ip.biz, it logs me on but i cant see myself, my jp starts at 0, and i loose connection in like 2 secs after i log in. and my friends cant use local host ip to get on my server and they tried using my server ip too and they had the same problem idk if its because i might need a program or something to run a 525 server but i got jdk 16 jre 16 and i use a router but i went to dmz and i even use the exceptions in my firewall and everything is fine but i just cant see mself and u loose conenction like 2 secs after log in so can anyone help me? maybe i got the enviromental variables wrong. but i would highly appreciate it if anyone can help me ive been trying to find the problem to this for about a week now and i really need it desparatly so pls help me.  and its my first time doing a 525 server i always did 317 but ye, and my friend had the same source and i used dragonscape 525 client for it and it worked but it wont work for me so i doubt its the clients problem. thx and hope someone out there can help me.</description>

              <p>What you should try is to make sure that you’re portforwarding is correctly setup. This happened to me once before; I didn’t set all the permissions on the forward, and therefore it kicked me out because of authorization errors. Good luck!</p>
