    <title>Which one is better [PI] or [Delta]?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-one-is-better-pi-or-delta/453872</link>
    <description>Now I been wondering this cause I see so many servers and tutorials for [PI] and also seems that [PI] has better graphics then [Delta], yet I love [Delta] because it is user friendly for me and i just get lost in [PI]&#39;s folders,....but I&#39;m wondering should i switch my server to a [PI]?</description>

<p>I wouldn’t chose either one tbh, they are both messy and look like they’ve gone through shitty developers. Unless that’s how the code was mean’t to look back in old java times.</p>

PI if your into loading high cache revisions and poorly written content (which can be fixed by you).<br>
Delta if your into adding a lot yourself, and the blank base has no organization.</p>
