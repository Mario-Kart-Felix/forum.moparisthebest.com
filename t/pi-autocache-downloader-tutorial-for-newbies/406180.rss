    <title>[PI] Autocache downloader Tutorial for newbies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-autocache-downloader-tutorial-for-newbies/406180</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen some people with a cache-ing problem such as myself. after i learned how to do this i would like to spread it to the community. its pretty easy so just follow the steps first:
you will need WINrar
and an account on www.dropbox.com

in your client file. look the for the folder called: yoursourcecache, yoursource is really the source you picked when dled the source&amp; client.
in there you will want to select everything IN that folder not the folder itself and right click add to archive as a .ZIP file.
once you have that. open up an internet browser and go to www.dropbox.com
make an account and everything. then you will want to upload your .ZIP file into the &quot;public&quot; dropbox file.
once its done uploading right click it on the site. and you should see on the right hand side copy public link this is the link you will need to have so go ahead and copy it. open up your client and find cachedownloader.java once you have found it rightclick and edit it as a .txt file.

scroll down a bit and you should see a URL there with with a .ZIP at the end of it.
what you want to do is delete that out and put the URL YOU copied there. i believe there is two lines of this. save the file and close out. in your client folder you will also fine signlink.java. you will need to do the same. once its done compile then run your client to see if it works :P
hope this tut has been helpful
