    <title>Do you think having a Random/Off topic board would kick ass?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-you-think-having-a-random-off-topic-board-would-kick-ass/6484</link>
    <description>Personally, I think it would kick ass so hard it would break it&#39;s own foot and end up going to the hospital, where the doctor (bearing uncanny resemblence to Miss Silabsoft) would quickly reshape the forums broken foot into a massive robotic foot, to stomp out the randomness and off topicness in all the other forums, ground them all into a pancake, and force them down the throats of the ready and willing revolutionaries of randomness, who stand at the crossroads of ass, and kicking.




And the greatest part of this discussion, and or debate, depending on whether your into that brevity shit or whatever, is that if enough people [b]do[/b] want such a board, for ass kicking of mega, gigantic, robotic, proportions, we shall recieve such a board, for ass kicking gigantic robotic proletarians back to their natural environment, which is that of truth and utter freedom of expression.


We must have the right, we must fight for the right. Join me brothers, sisters, and you too Pwnd, you can come too. Fight for the right to party, is what I&#39;m saying, my brothers, my sisters, and my Pwnd. Just remember, there is only one way to express ourselves in this world without mustard and vaseline, and that is [b]voting![/b]
