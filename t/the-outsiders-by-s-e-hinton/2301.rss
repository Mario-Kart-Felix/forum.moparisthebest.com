    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-outsiders-by-s-e-hinton/2301</link>
    <description>Most of you should have read this in school. I read it in 7th grade and loved it. I recently did a project and I chose Hinton as my author. Read this book to catch up on some more details and realized how great of a book it was.</description>

<p>From: <a href="http://www.allreaders.com/topics/Info_5161.asp" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.allreaders.com/topics/Info_5161.asp</a></p>
<blockquote>Ponyboy is a teenager in high school who just wants to fit in. However, he is a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks. One day a rich kid beats him up, and his friend, Johnny, kills the kid to save Ponyboy. They decide to run and hide instead of turning themselves in.
Laura J. Miller, Resident Scholar
<p>This is the story of Ponyboy Curtis who faces a daily battle with the gangster related culture of 1950’s America. Ponyboy is a greaser and he and his gang have battles with the soc’s. The greasers are the lowerclass and the soc’s socities upper class. Ponyboy is involved in a fight with the soc’s and this results in he and his friend Johnny running away to evade capture and further injury. They are caught in a fire and Johnny and Ponyboy become heroes for saving some children. The story has a tragic end for Johnny but leaves Ponyboy with the realization that he is no worse off being a greaser because he has morals, family and friends and above all else he is a bright kid with a bright future despite his hard struggle.<br>
Shel, Resident Scholar</p>
<p>Ponyboy Curtis struggles growing up as a poor youth with his overbearing older brother. One night while he is out, Curtis is attacked and his attacker is killed by his best friend. Curtis is forced to flee with his friend and grows up while he is on the road. The novel comes to a shocking conclusion while Curtis is on the road and he returns home with the maturity of a grown man.<br>
Daniela Lo Presti, Resident Scholar</p>
<p>The main character, Ponyboy (a greaser), lives with his two brothers, Darry and Sodapop. His parents died in a car accident. His brothers both dropped out of school so that they could support Ponyboy, who is very smart and gets good grades. There is also an ongoing battle against the Socs (the wealthy kids) and greasers.</p>
<p>After going to a movie, Ponyboy and his friend Johnny went to the park and the Socs started drowning Ponyboy and tried to beat up Johnny. In self-defense, Johnny killed one of the Socs.</p>
<p>So that the police would not catch them, their friend Dally told them to hop a freight and go to Jay Mountain and hide in the church there. They passed the time by playing cards and reading “Gone With the Wind”. When Dally finally came to get them, they filled up on food, and Johnny decided to turn himself in. While they were driving by the church, they realized that it was on fire, and that there were little kids inside.</p>
<p>Johnny and Ponyboy went inside and saved all the kids but both got injured. They were rushed to the hospital, where they found out that Johnny had severe burns, but Ponyboy was all right. That night, the Socs and greasers had a rumble and many people got hurt, but the greasers won.<br>
Ashley, Resident Scholar</p>
