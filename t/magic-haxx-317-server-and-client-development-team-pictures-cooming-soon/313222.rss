Magic Haxx is a just started development team that will try to create one of the best RSPS there is, to creat a SUPER client for our server. (HD and 317)
There is currently no progress because i am waiting for people to join the team (and i dont wanne screw it up because my team has something to say 2)
Requirements below.

[u][b]How can we update the server and the client because we live in different countries?[/b][/u]

Ok i am from belgium(just to let u know).

We are gonna update our client and server in a (tortoisse-)SVN trunk on Google Code.
This will be on a separated trunk.One for the client and one for the server.
