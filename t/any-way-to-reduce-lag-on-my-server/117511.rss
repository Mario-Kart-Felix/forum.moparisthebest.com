    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/any-way-to-reduce-lag-on-my-server/117511</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve already cleaned out my client.java and bit and that worked a little bit, but I don&#39;t want to do a ton cause last time I did, I screwed up my server and had to get a new one.  Does anyone know of any other good ways to reduce lag?</description>
