    <title>New Source Base With Bugs Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-source-base-with-bugs-help/422165</link>
    <description>Hey, I am using Cautionx V2 as a new base to my server but there are really 3 big problems noting in bank doesn&#39;t work which is a really bad thing for skillers who want to sell like 1k amulets to general store. And the other big bug is the attacking when wielding no weapon it does the wrong action when you click punch instead it does kick when you kick it blocks and when you block it punches. Help please I really want to fix these so I can start coding my server. And there is another one aswell the torva, pernix and virtus legs and body models look like when they are on the floor I put new models in but still same thing help please...

Thanks, Mr Rushed</description>
