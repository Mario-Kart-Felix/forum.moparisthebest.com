    <description>I have created a server and used http://www.dyndns.com/ as my DNS update client. Ok I have portforwared my router, modem, and put the exception in my firewall and it says my port is open on online checks etc and I can connect to it, but my friend can&#39;t on his laptop. Is this a problem on his end or mine?</description>
