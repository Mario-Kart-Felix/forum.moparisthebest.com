    <title>Everything seems to be working but still unable to connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/everything-seems-to-be-working-but-still-unable-to-connect/531980</link>
    <description>So it seems all the servers and compilers are all working and I can open up the RSC login screen but so far no matter what it says unable to connect to server and that the server is offline. Even with stuff like EasyRSC that supposedly requires no server.

Anyways I&#39;m 90% I&#39;ve port forwarded correctly and I haven&#39;t tampered with anything except for java and ant paths to make them work everything else is the same as when I downloaded it WTF IS GOING ON.

I&#39;m using Divinepk on win7
EVERYTHING works fine but it still says the server is offline plzhalp.</description>

              <p>Well if you’re just running it for that and other people don’t need to connect then you don’t have to worry about things like port forwarding.<br>
Just start the server, and then connect to it using the loopback IP address 127.0.0.1. Are you sure you’ve configured the client to connect to 127.0.0.1 using the correct port number (i.e., the port that the server is listening on) ?</p>
