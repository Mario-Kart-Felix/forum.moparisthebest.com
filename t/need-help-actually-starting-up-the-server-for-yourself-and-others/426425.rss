    <title>Need Help Actually Starting Up The Server For Yourself, and Others</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-actually-starting-up-the-server-for-yourself-and-others/426425</link>
    <description>Alright, im God Father, im new to moparscape forums but been playing runescape privates for some time now.. i&#39;ve gotten all the items needed to make the runescape private server such as (JDK, no-ip DUC, A server(source/client) and port forwarding) all of that has been done.  

Now my problem is that how do i actually start up the server? from where i got stuck is i was supposed to go the EGUI.java or GUI.java in the client folder and change the ip to my server ip.. but some servers that i&#39;ve downloaded here on moparscape, i could not locate those two files (GUI,EGUI) and continuously kept downloading other servers to see if they have it.. and when i did find it i changed the ip of what i was told in a video, but then i could not locate to run the source, and i could not run the client without the source being online.. 

i&#39;ve searched everywhere in the forums but all it seems to shwo is how to do the main things for a server (JDK,no-ip DUC,downloading a server).. but none show how do change the client server to mine.. and then starting it up completely. 

Please i need help, i&#39;ve come so far learning how to do this and i don&#39;t want to be stuck here for a simple thing that i can be helped with.</description>

You never have to change ips server sided? And if he wants to acctually get his server public he needs no ip otherwise he can just use 127.0.0.1</p>
