    <description>attached are pics of how to win at cell block  get the champion trophy and possibly the avatar (if there is one) First look at 1A and make your first move as I did. If you notice the move your opponent makes is the one shown in 1A then go to 1B. If they make a different move, go to 2A and see if thats there move. If there move is the one in 2A, then go to 2B. In 1B and 2B it will give you instructions on how to beat your opponent. Note you MUST move where i first moved to start off in 1A or 2A for 99% gurantied win!!! Once you make the first move in the same place I have in 1A or 2A, either go to 1B or 2B right  away for further instructions. Its guarentied 99% and LEGIT 100%!!!!  :D :D :D[br][size=1]Posted on: July 05, 2007, 09:47:07 PM[/size][hr]to view pics im guessing its easier to download them but i guess its ur choice[br][size=1]Posted on: July 05, 2007, 09:52:04 PM[/size][hr]also please give some feedback on this  id really appreciate it!!![br][size=1]Posted on: July 05, 2007, 09:53:06 PM[/size][hr]and i know it isnt a scar script but i had to get this out and there was no other place to put it!</description>

              <p>nice strategy works really well</p>
<p>also a small note for ppl who are following the strategy completely that sometimes you wont be able to move in a direction in the picture but there will be an area where u can get 4 in a row for a trap or 5 on the other side of a 4 where the last piece shown in the strategy is blocked by the computer player</p>
