              <p>Now I’m no expert, but it would appear that you cant establish a socket to whatever the original source is trying to connect to. My guess is that whatever ‘it’ is does not exist anymore, as the connection was refused. is the source modified? I would imagine that at the time of original development they had a main sever or such that would do something like check logins, manage hosts, etc. Do a traceback and find what is causing that faulty connection. Unfortunately, it could really be anything causing it. I wish i could tell you more, it all just comes back to a bug hunt  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
