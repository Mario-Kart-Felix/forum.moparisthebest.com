At the Marhaba border post, a vast portrait with the keffiyed Iraqi president grins benignly along at weary people. The post is really a dingy midnight pitstop regarding agonized waiting – a brief or sometimes not so quick , break in the 10-15 hours desert trek from Amman, Jordan. Welcome to the actual land of Saddam Hussein. CBSCBS News Correspondent Kimberly Dozier To go in this country, some fellow journalists endured a forced AIDS examination, and paid for the actual privilege.Iraqi officials combed by means of equipment looking for sites or cellphones : anything that makes it a hardship on the regime to follow communications with the world.From then on, the eyes associated with Saddam were everywhere."That tiny man who keeps appearing on a occupied street, out the part of my eye. Can be he watching?Inch I wondered. "Or is he just inquisitive? Are the phones stolen? Some, probably not just about all. Are we being followed? Sometimes, certainly."For a different journalist, a mistake often means a gentle dressing-down coming from a government official – a discomfort, an annoyance – in worst, the possibility that a great entry visa will not be approved the next time round.But for ordinary Iraqis, moving out of line is dangerous.Anyone here could be a spy: the milkman, the actual tea boy, or even the traffic cop. Even pointing out the Intelligence Ministry headquarters – a bunch of unmarked properties adorned with lurid drawings of Saddam – can land locals in a significantly worse place compared to jail. Or so individuals think, and that’s sufficient to keep them in line.Leaders in Wa and London courtroom Iraqi opposition groups, however it seems that no level of foreign funding may give them the lack of ability to overthrow Saddam.So it’s up to ordinary Iraqis here to overthrow their own omniscient and ever-present leader.
