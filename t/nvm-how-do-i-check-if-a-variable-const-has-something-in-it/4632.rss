    <title>[NVM] How do I check if a Variable/Const has something in it?</title>

    <description>Never mind, I got my answer after 40 minutes of testing lol. 

How do I check if a Variable/Const has something in it?

I asked a few people and they said if you do this...
If (effect) then
Begin
      // whatever here
End;

My const effect has nothing in it. I want it to check if it has anything in it. I get a type mismatch. And it can have anything in there because it will be user defined so it&#39;s not a boolean. 

But that didn&#39;t work. Is there a already made function or procedure or do I have to make one myself? :(

Thanks for the help.</description>
