    <description>okay so i&#39;m running off of pimpscape. i was doing this to play on it: i would hit runserver then i would open up moparscape and set the port. However, i couldn&#39;t make any changes because when i ran compile it said javac is not recognized. so i followed to ultimate server guide and installed jdk and changed the variables in my compouter for classpath and PATH. Now compile works, but when i click runserver, it automatically shuts the window or says &quot;Java is not a recognized executible file blah blah blah......&quot; so what do i do? can I ever run it again? HELP (please)!</description>
