<p>No you were banned, you were Project Amazed Carlos. The kid who claimed to have the two cousins working for Jagex ltd that were helping you program your server, lol. Believe me, after you got +100’d on that account I can remember banning a whole list of them that you had made to counter that. By all rules right now you deserve to be banned again on this account but Tom felt nice and didn’t want to let any of the mods reban you.<br>

<p>Um… yes it was idiot. Even if it wasn’t, you’re evading a ban like Ruby said which is against the rules.</p>

<p>I’m sorry to DC9 for repeatedly coming back because I know how much of a pain it is to have to revisit threads as a moderator. How on earth can you possibly say to people “none of you know what to do”. You’ve made a runt of the framework, you’ve made a runt of yourself. Accept it and try to learn and move on. Stop putting yourself above others, you are not a programmer. You’re a retard behind a computer. Work on learning an actual programming language and maybe then you can come back and give people some form of pointers towards what “none of them know what to do”.</p>
