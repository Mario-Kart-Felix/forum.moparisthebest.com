Hi, I was looking for some help if any one could spare a few minutes of their time to help me. My problem is that my server is crashing at twenty or more people, and I checked the &quot;Let more than 30 people on your server&quot; tut but I do believe it was removed. So please if any one can help me I would be ever so thankful.
Thank you and have a nice day! :) 
(PS: Please dont be rude and say &quot;get a faster cpu&quot; or &quot;get a better internet connection&quot; or a combination of the two. and for those that must say that I have the best place u can put it and ill gladly tell you were u can put it! :))
