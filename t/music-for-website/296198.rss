    <title>Music for Website</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/music-for-website/296198</link>
    <description>http://www.young-guns.biz i need to choose some music for it, about 5 tracks so i can show it to the boss to choose one, preferably costing under $100 for the licence or if the track is royalty free then the download costing under $100, it needs to be done legally as it is not my business.

i have found: http://www.studiocutz.com which offers royalty free music, the website needs a western / rock theme i think, to appleal to people aged 14-22.

if you could give me your thoughts, would appriciate it.

also, if you know of any better websites where to get music from that would also be great!
