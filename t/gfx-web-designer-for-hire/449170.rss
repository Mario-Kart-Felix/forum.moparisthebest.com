I know this is not ethical but I couldn&#39;t choose a development team to post on, so I am offering my services for free. I will do all GFX required of me, and even web design if needed. I have been doing GFX for 3 years and Web design for 2. I specialize in SMF, and use Photoshop CS6, and Cinema 4D. I am efficient and work when told to.

For me to work on your server you must have a well set plan. I don&#39;t want to put my time into a project that &quot;may&quot; take off. I can offer small coding advice if I can remember anything for delta. But mainly I am done coding and wish to focus upon my other talents. I prefer to do Clean artwork but I can also do grunge effect which some people prefer.

If you hire me then expect to keep me around. I am not going to make you a website, and graphics for nothing. It is free real cash wise. But I inspect some type of In-Game award, such as custom rank referring to my position as GFX/Web Designer. Or Item/Gold to compensate for my work. If I make you a website then I will have admin rights on website but those rights do not need to also go to in-game unless you seem fit.

Now for some of my work.

For web design click [url=http://afoneptune.co.cc]here[/url] that is a PS3 Battlefield 3 clan I am part of and create their graphics and website.
