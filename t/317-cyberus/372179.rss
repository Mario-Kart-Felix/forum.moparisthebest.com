[size=18pt]Idea:[/size][/i]
[b]Cyberus[/b] is a [b]Hyperion[/b] based server. Its a [b]317[/b] loading the [b]377[/b] cache, I do not plan to load things that weren&#39;t originally in the cache like Dragon fire shield, Bandos godsword, Dark bow, Vesta long sword, etc. Just because it we won&#39;t be loading any newer data does [b]NOT[/b] mean its going to be a OSRemake.

I [b]AM[/b] going to finish, and host this. After I am done I may release this. I believe if I did that it would encourage people to use a much better base than winterLove. It would also encourage people to learn two other languages, [b]XML[/b] and [b]JScript[/b].

[size=18pt]Goal:[/size][/i]
To make a fun, stable server that players won&#39;t get bored on.

[i]
[size=18pt]Languages:[/size][/i]
[b]JScript[/b]; our scripting language.
[b]XML[/b]; our database language.
And [b]Java[/b], of course.

[i]
[size=18pt]Media:[/size][/i]

[b]Server[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[IMG]http://i524.photobucket.com/albums/cc330/Rabrg/Privatechat.jpg[/img]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[b]Client[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[i]
[size=18pt]Report system:[/size][/i]

I have a feeling that I will be asked what this does, so here is how it works:

The reporter types in the players name on the report screen and then clicks the rule they broke.

If the player that they reported is not online it will stop there and send the message &quot;You can&#39;t report a player that isn&#39;t online!&quot;

If the player is online it will flag that player. What flagging does is, when the player is first flagged, it will create a text file named after the reported player. At the beginning of the file it will show the time and date of when the player was reported, who reported the player, and the reason the player was reported. When the player is flagged it will also record actions that the player does in the text file until the player logs out, then the player will be unflagged.

The moderator option on the report screen DOES work.
