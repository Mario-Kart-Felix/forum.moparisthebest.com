    <title>459 look a like | By Chosen Pkz</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/459-look-a-like-by-chosen-pkz/345116</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i really thrive off the 459 style. For this project i wanted to make a 459 look a like! My prefered base would be either Porject Insanity, or Battlescape. Why? Because i have yet to come across a 459 look a like with a good combat system. I wan&#39;t this project to blow other look a likes away. I need a good client developer to know what he is doing with side icons etc. So if you guys want in, and believe in what i am saying. Please contact me, or fill out an application below.

Thanks, Samuel.
