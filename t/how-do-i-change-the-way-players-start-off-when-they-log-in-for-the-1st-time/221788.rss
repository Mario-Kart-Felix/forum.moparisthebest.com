<p>Yeah or you can do it in the client can’t you? I dont have a source downloaded so I forgot, xD</p>

</aside>
<p>You. Please for the love of God get off this thread, you are helping NOONE.</p>
<p>BACKONTOPIC;<br>
To change the appearance of your character you would look for a code that looks like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		playerEquipment[playerHat]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerCape]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerAmulet]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerChest]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerShield]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerLegs]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerHands]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerFeet]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerRing]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerArrows]=-1;
		playerEquipment[playerWeapon]=-1;</code></pre>
<p>That is pretty self explanatory if you read the code. But what you need to do is input the code of an item into the slot there you want and the ones you don’t want an item in you would leavea as -1.</p>
<p>Near that code you should see one that looks like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		//Setting player standard look
		playerLook[0] = 7;
		playerLook[1] = 21;
		playerLook[2] = 28;
		playerLook[3] = 33;
		playerLook[4] = 40;
		playerLook[5] = 44;</code></pre>
<p>For that you would need to experiment with the numbers until you find the look you want. Here are the numbers you will be needing there</p>
<p>[code]/*<br>
0-9: male head<br>
10-17: male beard<br>
18-25: male torso<br>
26-32: male arms<br>
33-35: male hands<br>
36-41: male legs<br>
42-44: male feet</p>
<p>45-55: fem head<br>
56-60: fem torso<br>
61-66: fem arms<br>
67-69: fem hands<br>
70-78: fem legs<br>
79-81: fem feet<br>
*/[/code]</p>
