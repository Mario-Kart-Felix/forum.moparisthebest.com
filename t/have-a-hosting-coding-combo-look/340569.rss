    <title>Have a Hosting/Coding combo? (LOOK)!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/have-a-hosting-coding-combo-look/340569</link>
    <description>So does your development team have a Hoster/Coder combination? And your constantly having to upload to a site and having the other download or sending through teamviewer? Well....



[url=http://www.dropbox.com]http://www.dropbox.com[/url]



This site downloads a Dropbox for you which is a folder that lets you and your hoster save complication due to that shizzy old uploading and sending through TV. You place your client/source files into the dropbox file once you have both downloaded dropbox and logged in to a certain account that you make. So your coder can edit the source, compile. It verifys that the changes she/he made were safe to your computer and it allows you to make progress with the file. So you can both compile, run at the same time and everything!


@@ Let me know if this helped or if your glad I brought this to attention to all of you.

- If the file/folder in the Dropbox you edited was Safe then you infected it, you wont infect your partner because it detects it and removes the infected file.

Thanks, Pl0X15</description>
