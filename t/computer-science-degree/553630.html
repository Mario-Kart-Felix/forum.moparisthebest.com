Thanks!![/quote]You can definitely teach yourself everything you could learn at university, and I’m sure a lot of interviewers would be more impressed if you turned up with a solid portfolio of experience rather than a university certificate. The problem, at least in the UK, is that most companies look for graduates and you wont get past HR without a 2.1 degree. I think you’d have to work a lot harder to find a decent paying job if you went down the self-taught route. CS graduates can pretty much walk straight out of uni and into a graduate scheme or permanent position.</p>
<p>You could of course take a different approach and go into freelancing or found a startup. Then nobody is going to care about your degree, but obviously higher risk etc.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think they’re all valid choices but it depends which one suits you personally.</p>

        <p>Get the degree. You’ll likely start with a higher pay and have a lot less trouble finding a job. If you were the only person applying for an offer then you’d probably have a good shot, but it’s likely that you won’t be and the easiest filtration process for the company would be to check for a degree.</p>
<p>My step-dad took the route of teaching himself and then taking tests to earn certificates, but his salary compared to a graduate’s is not as high. Yes, it’s possible. I can agree that most of the things at a university could be self-taught, but that’s not how the world works (but apply your knowledge from your university to build up yourself and resume concurrently as well).</p>

        <p>Well the big problem of mine was money. I mean I dont mind staying at this university for another year but financially its going to kill me. I am paying too much money I believe but what I plan to do is transfer to a community college get all my basic dumb classes out of the way then transfer back to another university to get my degree in CS.</p>

<p>If you are good at it, it will pay for itself pretty quickly. You can also do paid internships as part of the schooling.</p>

<p>A lot of people have that problem. Apply for as much financial aid as you can, including any scholarships offered by your university.</p>
<p>As jme said, build build build that resume and interview skills and apply for internships. Many people wait for their junior year of college, but it is never too early to apply - I received an offer my sophomore year and am returning to the same company this summer, then likely trying a new company for my senior year. It’s all about getting your foot in the door. I haven’t taken out loans because of childhood saving for my first 2 years, and then internships are paying for the rest of my schooling (most internships related to CS/SE are paid). Work your ass off.</p>

<p>My experience was that most companies reject huge numbers of applicants right off the bat, after you’ve spent hours filling in their shit application form putting in your grades one by one and answering dumb ass questions that the hiring managers don’t even care about. One place I applied for had 100s of applicants, invited a few for interview, and didn’t even hire anyone… so put the ad back up and repeated the entire process.</p>
<p>I also did a couple of internships, and thought I did really well… got good feedback from managers etc. Then just got rejected when applying after graduating… so much for “getting your foot in the door”</p>

<p>That likely depends on your area and the companies your applying for. One of the major companies in my area I applied for basically did the same thing, while the other was renowned for internships and extending graduation offers to the interns.</p>
<p>I don’t know your background/area but I have several relatives and friends that had no trouble finding a starting programming job fresh out of college. Maybe you’re looking in the wrong places, or it’s just different around here.</p>

<p>When I was at uni the advice I got was “apply for shit loads of internships until you get one, super important m8”. I was starting to trade-off time that could have been spent doing coursework or preparing for exams because I just kept getting rejected/ignored from each one. I just don’t want anyone to think that’s the right thing to do, because at the time I didn’t really have the context to know that grades are more important than a couple months of experience.</p>

<p>I guess it depends what you consider “no trouble”. It only took me a couple of weeks and got the first job I was actually interviewed for, but still had to deal with a shit load of rejections in that time. It probably is a location thing though, since all my friends had the same experience.</p>
<p>In hindsight I think the best approach would have been to apply for a very small number of internships and just concentrate on the course. There’s enough time after graduating to prepare for interviews.</p>

<p>I’m still confused on how applying for an internship interfered with your studies. Maybe it’s a different process in my area?? Here we apply for internships in the fall/early spring and do them over the summer.</p>
<p>I mean, you should be trying to do internships AND get passing grades…but like I said, this is going to vary greatly from area to area and company to company on how much one or the other matters.</p>
<p>Point is, learn and get yourself out there, you’ll get a job. Internships will help pay for school and also provide an experience to talk about if you do manage to snag an interview later.</p>
<p>If you were an employer, which would you pick?</p>
<ol>
<li>You interview a student with an admirable GPA. He/she has no experience to talk about other than school projects, thus no experience on large-scale projects.</li>
<li>You interview a student who has mostly As/Bs, and Cs, and during the interview talks about past projects he/she worked on for previous companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Employers in my experience so far are much more interested in what I have worked on and couldn’t give two shits about how I did in my Calculus III class. Grades come into a larger factor when you’re applying for a large company with many applicants, because it’s an easy weed-out.</p>

        <p>[quote=“robonick8, post:1, topic:553630”]Okay so I am currently enrolled at a University and it is my freshman year. I am at Kent State University and majoring in Computer Science. I met with my adviser today to discuss future scheduling<br>
and it looks to me that I will have to be here at school for 5 years instead of 4 to get my B.S degree in computer science. Not really wanting to do that but is it recommended now a days to get a degree in computer science or would taking online courses or going to an IT school be good like to build up a portfolio of work to show to companies of what I can do.</p>
<p>Just wanted to know some opinions so I could start looking into other options unless you all think its best to get the degree at this university.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think!!<br>
Thanks!![/quote]</p>
<p>KSU, I went to high school (CFHS) not even 15 minutes from there. Interesting.</p>
