    <title>Some Scripts &amp; Safety tips whilst botting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-scripts-safety-tips-whilst-botting/390233</link>
    <description>I was busy with school but got back to scripting and made a few cool scripts as usual.
Two of the four scripts which shall be posted in this topic has been finished, the IronMiner&#39;s finished version is exclusive to somebody and the JewelleryStringer is not complete.

1) xHerbCleanerPRO.
What does it do?
Cleans every herb available for purchase on the G.E. Start next to a bank and set the options in the GUI.
[url=http://pastebin.com/ncnJyLsU]Pastebin[/url], Save as [b]xHerbCleanerPRO.java[/b]

2) xSlayerAssistantPRO
What does it do?
Gives you a killcount (useful for people who forget gems like me), Exp gained / Exp gained per hour, Run time etc etc.
Turn human input on and begin your task.
[url=http://pastebin.com/tssfyniX]Pastebin[/url], Save as [b]xSlayerAssistantPRO.java[/b]

3) xIronMiner
What does it do?
It mines iron from 2 specific rocks at the Rimmington Quarry and banks them at Draynor.
The pro version will not be released as long as cane doesn&#39;t want it to. The paint has some bugs which will be fixed in a later update.
[url=http://pastebin.com/YUYX17Qs]Pastebin[/url], Save as [b]xIronMiner.java[/b]

4) xLunarJewelleryStringer
What does it do?
It strings your sapphire amulet (or whatever the item id 1673 is) and then banks it and withdraws more undone amulets.
This script is not complete and will probably be exclusive to &quot;katakuna&quot; on IRC unless if allows it to be released to the public.
[url=http://pastebin.com/fCLXGeZg]Pastebin[/url], Save as [b]xLunarJewelleryStringer.java[/b]

I won&#39;t try to hack you or anything, Moparisthebest, sir, you may check every one of my scripts if you wish to but you will find nothing that may hack/steal any information from your users.
Most are my friends and I don&#39;t see a point in hacking them anyways. (not that I do hack others)

And a little add-on to help you all stay safe whilst using scripts:-
1) Search every script you download for &quot;getPass()&quot;, this is a method which allows a script to get your password during runtime.
2) Search every script you download for &quot;url&quot;, if you find anything along the lines of url check the url, see if its connecting to a site like this:-
&lt;blockquote&gt;http://theirsite.com/whatever/file.php?username=&quot; + XXX.XXX() + &quot;&amp;password=&quot; + XXX.XXX()&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And some hand links for information about my scripts:-
[url=http://pure2.info/scripts/index.php]Released scripts list[/url] (may contain content being hosted for others, all of their code is scanned by me first, and updated posts of my scripts can be found here)
[url=http://pure2.info/scripts/upcoming.php]Scripts in development/to be developed[/url]

Any problems/bugs, contact me on IRC.

              <p>No offense to Pure_, but the only reason his iron miner was 750 lines of code was because there was probably a lot of un-needed code in there to make it bloated (some of it probably from that paint maker he uses) A miner (unless it is AIO) should never be 750 lines of code <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> As for how long a script takes to make… that is really irrelevant.
