    <description>The front page is based on how old a server is (ex a server that was registered in 2009 would be #1 followed by newer servers) which would replace the % online idea. It&#39;s not really good that a server that was registered in November with 100% uptime beats a server that was registered over a year ago with 95% uptime.</description>
