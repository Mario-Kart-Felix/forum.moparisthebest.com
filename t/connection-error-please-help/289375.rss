Nobody can connect. i made ports with Both enabled. Just UDC and i even used specific ip&#39;s for my friends via firewall ports. But NOTHING will work... Do you think somebody could come help me?

<p>To check go to Command Prompt and type Ipconfig/all</p>
<p>Where it says Ip Address…That’s the ip to forward.</p>
