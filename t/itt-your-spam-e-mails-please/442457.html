<blockquote>Hello
<p>My name is Engr. Patrick Nimo, I work with the National Oil Company of Equatorial Guinea also known as GEPetrol. I will officially guide you on how to obtain a crude oil sales license with GEPetrol. This crude oil sales license gives the beneficiary the mandate to sell GEPetrol ALBA crude oil to any part of the world and the license attracts a host commission of $3 per barrel sold.</p>
<p>This means that GEPetrol will be paying you a total commission of $3 per each barrel sold under your license as the license operator. This crude oil sales license has a capacity of one million barrels of crude oil per month, this means that at the end of every sales transaction monthly, you are entitled to receive a total commission of $3MUSD from GEPetrol.</p>
<p>I will give you details on how this works as soon as I confirm your understanding.<br>
We shall proceed as soon as I hear from you.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Patrick</p>

        <blockquote>In 2003 Chairman Bob Avakian delivered an historic talk in the United States, now available in video. This talk is a wide-ranging revolutionary journey. It breaks down the very nature of the society we live in and how humanity has come to a time where a radically different society is possible. Full of heart and soul, humor and seriousness, it will challenge you and set your heart and mind to flight.
BOB AVAKIAN is a creative and wide-ranging thinker who maintains a profound sense of the actual struggles, trends and sentiments among the masses, the movements of opposition, and society broadly. And, he is the leader of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA, which is seriously setting its sight on the seizure of power right within the U.S. itself, and the revolutionary transformation of society as part of the world proletarian revolution. He will take you on a journey that can change your life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>FROM MRS SARAH MOJOLA
               (mojolasarah23@gmail.com)
<p>LETTER OF<br>
ASSISTANCE</p>
<p>Dear Sir/madam:</p>
<p>You might be surprised to receive this mail letter from me since you don’t know me personally. I am Mrs. SARAH MOJOLA the wife of late Mr Michael MOJOLA who was murdered by the Zimbabwean war veterans and irate people. I am writing this letter from Harare, Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>I got your contact address through South Africa Chamber of Commerce and Industry in South Africa, when I went to South Africa to see my son JAMES. After due consideration of your Profile, hence I decided to write to you. I write to solicit for your special assistance to my family Shattered by a tyrannical government led by a dictator and his (ZANU-PF) ruling party, President ROBERT MUGABE.</p>
<p>Because of land and farmland crisis in Zimbabwean the government secretly sponsored the war Veterans and some irate party members to dispose the land being occupied by the white farmers.</p>
<p>This action has led to killing of some members of opposition party including my husband who did not support this ill-fated action. But before the death of my husband, he anticipated some dangers and so he smuggled out the sum of US$25.5 million dollars (Twenty five million five Hundred Thousand united state dollars) to South Africa and deposited it in a Security Company With the intention of using it for the purchase of farm machinery and chemicals for agricultural Purpose in South Africa and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland.</p>
<p>This money was deposited in a box as family valuables to avoid much demurrage in the Security Company. On the 29 March 2007 the war veterans and some supporters of (ZANU-PF) ruling party trooped into our compound and axed my husband to death and my second son of 25yrs.  Since then they have been terrorizing my son James but he managed to escape to neighbouring country South Africa as a political asylum seeker (refugee).Mugabe burned the Media not to publish any news as it will reflect bad on him and also on the neighbouring African countries especially South Africa as They were about hosting the 2010 soccer world cup.</p>
<p>His position in South Africa does not permit him to open an account or to operate any business. That is why I want this fund to be transferred in your account so that you will assist him to invest the money in your country. If you accept to assist us, all I want from you is to arrange and come down to Johannesburg, South Africa so that you can help him to open a non-resident bank account in your name, or in your company name which will aid us in transferring the money into your nominating account overseas.</p>
<p>My family and I have two options for you, firstly, you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account in this transaction or we can go into partnership with you for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country whichever the option, fell free to notify him. He will then furnish you with every detail you need to know.</p>
<p>We have also mapped out 5% of the total sum for any expenses that might be incurred during the time of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership, we are willing to give you 25% of the money while the remaining 70% will remain for my family, if you are really capable and willing to assist us please contact him immediately in South Africa on the same email address:</p>
<p>email:( <a href="mailto:mojolasarah23@gmail.com">mojolasarah23@gmail.com</a> )</p>
<p>Please treat this matter as urgent as possible,<br>
Thanks for you’re mutual co-operation.</p>
<p>I’m expecting your urgent response.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>MRS SARAH MOJOLA.</p>

        <blockquote>Hello,
<p>I am Sgt. Gilbert Gooch serving with the United States Army under NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Upon the directives of the Pentagon that we must evacuate Iraq immediately for Afghanistan, I am now serving in one of the United States military base in Kabul and my duty tour will come to an end this year 2012, Our mission is to help beef up security in insurgent prone areas and train both the afghan Police and the Military to take over the security of their country soon.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I want to inform you that I have in my possession the sum of $10.2 million USD, which is made from a crude oil deal while serving in the Basra region of Iraq. For security reasons this money is kept with a Red Cross Agent informing him that we are making contact for the real owner of the money and it is under my power to approve whoever comes forth for the money.</p>
<p>I want to invest the money in a profitable business as soon as my duty tour comes to an end this year, I will need your advice on good investment areas. Due to my high level security clearance, I have a 100% authentic means of transferring the money through diplomatic courier service .All I need is your acceptance and all is done.</p>
<p>For now we can only communicate through our military communication facilities that are secured so nobody can monitor our emails. I will get back to you through email for me to be sure of whom am dealing.</p>
<p>If you are interested, please send me your personal mobile number so I can call you for further enquiries when am outside the base camp. I am writing you from a fresh email account so if you are not interested do not reply to this email and please delete this message, if there is no response from you after 3days, I will look for someone else.</p>
<p>I wait for your contact details to proceed immediately. Within 5days, the money should be in your possession. I will come over for my own share later. I will give you 30% of the sum and 70% is for me, hope am been fair to you.</p>
<p>Waiting for your response.</p>
<p>Sgt. Gilbert Gooch</p>

<p>It was secretly deposited and has been moved to another finance company’s security vault.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, this project is 100% risk free.</p>
