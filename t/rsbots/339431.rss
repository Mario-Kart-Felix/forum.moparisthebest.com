    <description>Does anyone have the &quot;rsbots&quot; client? I went to the site and another to, and i click to download the client and they both take me to like impsoft or something, and it says &quot;you can only download once every 180 seconds&quot; i leave it on that screen and it never downloads, so i refresh the page and yet it still doesn&#39;t download. Does anyone have a link for that same client i can download?

Thanks

<p>first of all on some computers you have to use svn to get client, there is a tutorial how to download the client with svn, use help section.<br>

<p>First of all, its a download link you don’t need svn to use the bot, secondly there is a tutorial on google on how to click a button, its easy to understand. I should also say that when you click the download button, you stay on the main page and the download message comes up. there’s no need to have to use svn when the download link is already supplied at your fingers. Svn is a better choice, but most people can’t set it up like there own Java’s.[/quote]</p>
<p>you should see a tutorial how not to be a dick to other people, plus<br>
dip stick, get some proper attitude, then talk.<br>
After Jagex threatend rsbot, they added half of the code in to “<a href="http://google.code.com" rel="nofollow noopener">google.code.com</a>” or what ever it is, because one of the scripters erased it after the threat and you have to use SVN to download on some computers, there even is a link to it…</p>
<p>Abou SVN, what’s not to understand, download it, instal, right click on the client folder, use SVN, enter Url of google code and that’s it, there’s no need of any JAVA knowledge at all.</p>

              <p>Does anyone have the “rsbots” client? I went to the site and another to, and i click to download the client and they both take me to like impsoft or something, and it says “you can only download once every 180 seconds” i leave it on that screen and it never downloads, so i refresh the page and yet it still doesn’t download. Does anyone have a link for that same client i can download?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
