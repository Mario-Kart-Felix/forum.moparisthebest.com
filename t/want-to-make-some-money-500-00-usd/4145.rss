    <title>Want to Make Some Money? $500.00 USD +!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/want-to-make-some-money-500-00-usd/4145</link>
    <description>Im in need of a programmer(s) to create a new &quot;hybrid&quot;, &quot;bot&quot;, or anything of the sorts for Runescape 2. 

Now I know that you all must be thinking why would I be looking for a programmer when I have dcthugs working on Bender, well, simple, hes very busy with real life matters right now, so hes taking a bit of a leave of absence, which will encompass a month or two. 

So I figured why not get something else on a lower scale rolling, such as a &quot;hybrid&quot;, basically this is an open post for anyone to take on the challenge of creating something that will provide the RS2 cheating scene something new and innovative.


If you are willing to work on this project, and are very serious about programming, then please contact me through a PM, I will then give you my MSN so we can continue to talk through there.

Now the price range for this project will be around $500.00 USD (depending), this price all depends on what you create, if its something simple, it could be less, so you are working for your own price basically.

Im looking for ANYONE that is interested, or if you know anyone that has the knowledge to create anything, PM me their MSN, forum names, anything!!


Have fun with this, please!

<p>Also Teh Freak, understandable, if you could make a app to compare methods via bytecode then it would be pretty damn easy to update and as you said Aryan when it was kept in private was majorly better, we dont want noobs making party hats.</p>
<p>Cant any of you see, in ways cheating has destroyed runescape, yet broadened our knowledge, well most of us besides the idiots who cant even run SCAR.</p>

‘stats bots’, that people can use to get info on a npc/item, i did some stuff earlier, around 413 and such, i just redid some old tuts i released on kaitnieks likes hp over head, which worked, pk minimap, some basic functions like attackNPC, walkTo, various unimportant things, but recreating each of these time after time is pointless, i would continue to make bots if i were to make an app to compare methods via bytecode, then i would know what method is which, i could know which fields are which, and updating would be ungodly easy, but manually creating a bot isnt worth the time, i would do it, if i knew it was worth the time, but i would never go public, id keep it private, like the later stages of aryan were, its better that way.</p>

<p>I’m not doubting the fact that you’ve made a deobber, but why haven’t you released it? Or at least sold it? Or made a bot out of it, Like DC Has?</p>

              <p>Personally, i wouldnt pay 500 bucks for some shitty ass ‘awt command sending’ shit, thats a huge waste of money, scar isnt that great as it is anyways, and tbh, idk what people would want to do this, 500 bucks is nice, but if they had the brains they could flip it all, sell auths for ungodly amounts, pull a richyt, and get pretty rich.</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Also, DC is so not the only person to deob, im tired of hearing that, i can deob, defyboy can deob, krich can deob, people need to learn to read and stop saying DC IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DEOB, or “SUCH AND SUCH IS THE ONLY ONE!!!11111”, pretty annoying. but, i just wanted to give everyone my 2 cents.</p>
