    <description>I got 7 things I need help with on matrix 718 I&#39;m new to coding 718 so don&#39;t hate
first how would I add dialogue to an Npc?
second how do I make an Npc give the player an item only for Donators
third how do I make a ring give bonus Exp while wielding it but it only works in the Donator zone
fourth how do I change the speed of when cutting a magic tree the logs give you them faster
How would I add Grand Exchange to the source there isn&#39;t one already there
And how can I add a working 100% money pouch
how would I make a teleport need donator only to teleport there? iv made the command just don&#39;t know how to make it req donator the rights is = 0 atm

I will rep/thank if you can help me with one or all of these I don&#39;t expect all my questions to be answered at least I have done a few of them that fine</description>
