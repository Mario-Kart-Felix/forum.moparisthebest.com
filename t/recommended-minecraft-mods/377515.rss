    <description>Had a few people ask for a certain mod link, so here it is.

http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?t=55700


After you download the zip file, extract it into Your .minecraft folder (not bin)
so it should show Bin, mods, texture packs, and all those folders.
afterwards, run MrMPatcher.jar. If you get the error &quot;cannot find the main class, program will now exit&quot;,
make a file called run.bat, and put this in it.
[code]java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar MrMPatcher.jar nogui[/code]
Then run that.
You will now get something that pops up, and will have &quot;better light&quot;, &quot;better grass&quot;, &quot;SMChat&quot;, and &quot;minimap&quot; or something like that.
Check whatever you desire (I recommend them all, they make the game look beautiful.)

Afterwards, go to the top, and on &quot;original&quot; click browse and find your minecraft.jar (appdata/.minecraft/bin [I recommend making a copy of it incase something goes wrong.])
then for output, just click save, it should automatically direct to your bin folder.

Afterwards, click patch at the bottom, and let it patch. When it finishes, just run minecraft normally.

[size=14pt]Basic rundown of the mods[/size]
Better light: blends the light to look more smooth, rather than blocky.
Better grass: I can&#39;t really explain it that well, but on grass that is 1block high I guess, it replaces the side texture of dirt with grass, to the grass, so it looks green on all sides.
SMChat: Press tab to reply to the last message (/msg) you have received.
SimpleMap: AWMG A MINIMAP (this is for Mitb, who requested it)</description>
