    <description>Hi everybody. Im pretty sure at least a hundred of you know me, because i was here since the creation of the forums. ~3 months after that i got banned for spamming. I understand my mistake, and i know how hard it is for mods and admins to keep track of spam and non-spam. So yeah, i know that i broke a very big rule by spamming. I&#39;m sorry moparisthebest and the mods at the time. And I&#39;m sorry everyone else. I know this is a really big and popular community, and by spamming i made it worse. I understand my mistake and im hoping that i can get another chance. Also, before i started writing this letter of apology, i was browsing through the forums. This reminded me of the end of the movie, &quot;The Aviator.&quot; I was browsing through the forums and i saw spam, and people werent getting blamed for it, i meaqn the first ten messages i saw were like.


&lt;blockquote&gt;[quote]
some quote
[/quote]
^^ Spam &lt;&lt; Spam

and

[code]
some weird java code flaming some guy
[/code]
It doesnt work&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So the part reminding me of the movie is.
Senator Brewster (in our case moparisthebest and other people) was blaming  Howard Hughes (this case me) of taking money to build planes that never flew (&quot;planes that never flew&quot; is spam in our case). Howard Hughes said that companies like Boeing, lockheed took money on planes that never flew. Boeing and lockheed being other members.

So my point. I&#39;m not the onl one spamming, but im the only one getting warnings for it. 

But anyways,m i understand my mistake, and i really want to be part of this growing and thriving community. I hope people would understand me, and i mean after all, people deserve second chances. So i was hoping i could get that second chance. And i swear that ill try not to spam. I understand the hard work that&#39;s needed to keep this community alive and ill do my best make it easier.

Also, the IRC thing, everybody was ignoring me and i needed someone to talk to. Sorry daiki and everyone else. :)</description>

              <p>You honestly think that we dont spectate these forums enough to find spam? How would spammer recognize spam? If he would he would not spam. I remember you ilyaostr and I have nothing good to say about you. We do punish people. But unlike you the spammers we currently have contributes to the community in a way or another. You were nothing else than a spammer.</p>
<p>You can apologize and ask to be allowed to be here. But since you havent done anything besides spammed why should we allow you to be here? I myself think that this community doesent need you. Ofcourse you may have changed in a one way or the other but you havent proved us that we would need you. And when I say “need you” I dont expect you to learn Java as much as human can or write SCAR scripts better than anyone else. We need those funny guys… Guys who helps new users (and old ones aswell). Guys who doesent spam, flame or anything else like that.</p>
<p>Good guys will be remembered long time.</p>
<p>But if you think you deserve another chance then I dont see no point not to give you one. You can expect me to monitor you pretty closely.</p>

              <p>Your “apology” started out great.  Then it turned into you saying it’s not fair that you are the only one being targetted and that the mods/admins don’t really care, they just decided to pick on you.  You then wrote some big long story about some movie no one cares about in an attempt to get your point across.  Yeah, you’re here, people are pissed at you for some reason or another, and whatever else you want to hear.  But by “apologizing” then saying no one else is getting warned/banned is basically saying “You mods and admins have no clue about what you’re supposed to be doing.  I was banned, but other people doing the same thing were not.  I’m not sorry and will never be, you should just make sure the rules are enforced on EVERYONE, not just me.  I was banned unfairly and I hope you got your heads out of your asses so you can do what is right.”  Turning your “apology” into a defensive maneuver is just childish.  Accept what happened to you, truly be sorry or just forget about it.</p>
<p>No one really cares whether you are sorry for what you did or not.  I’m not being mean, just truthful.  This is the internet.  I don’t care if if you act like you’re 18 and you’re only 12, I don’t care if someone’s a boy and they act like a girl, I don’t care if some 45 year old pervert is trying to seduce 14 year olds.  I don’t care if you masturbate to animal porn.  It just doesn’t matter to me.  Most people are the same way.  Apologizing for something you did may make you feel better about yourself, but no one cares.  No one thinks any differently of you just because you said that you were sorry for what you’ve done.  I don’t remember you and had no opinion about you at all.  Now, I think less of you than before because of how your “apology” shifted from you being sorry to accusing the mods and admins of being unjust.  “It’s not fair, PersonX is spamming too!!”  Die.  Just pay attention to what YOU’RE doing.  That’s what really matters.</p>

Sup, I’ve been here for only like 2-3 month’s, not that old but still love this forums above all. About your request, I wouldn’t give you a second chance because then we’d have to give a second chance to everyone else in order to keep things in line.</p>

<p>And your not the only one being warned.  Users are tracked on how much spam they produce, and if it gets too much, then a mod or admin will PM them about it.  If it gets excessive, then they will be banned.</p>
<p>Hope your a changed guy. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Hi everybody. Im pretty sure at least a hundred of you know me, because i was here since the creation of the forums. ~3 months after that i got banned for spamming. I understand my mistake, and i know how hard it is for mods and admins to keep track of spam and non-spam. So yeah, i know that i broke a very big rule by spamming. I’m sorry moparisthebest and the mods at the time. And I’m sorry everyone else. I know this is a really big and popular community, and by spamming i made it worse. I understand my mistake and im hoping that i can get another chance. Also, before i started writing this letter of apology, i was browsing through the forums. This reminded me of the end of the movie, “The Aviator.” I was browsing through the forums and i saw spam, and people werent getting blamed for it, i meaqn the first ten messages i saw were like.</p>
<blockquote>[quote]
some quote
[/quote]
^^ Spam &lt;&lt; Spam
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">some weird java code flaming some guy</code></pre>
<p>It doesnt work</p>
</blockquote><br>
So the part reminding me of the movie is.<br>
Senator Brewster (in our case moparisthebest and other people) was blaming  Howard Hughes (this case me) of taking money to build planes that never flew (“planes that never flew” is spam in our case). Howard Hughes said that companies like Boeing, lockheed took money on planes that never flew. Boeing and lockheed being other members.
<p>So my point. I’m not the onl one spamming, but im the only one getting warnings for it.</p>
<p>But anyways,m i understand my mistake, and i really want to be part of this growing and thriving community. I hope people would understand me, and i mean after all, people deserve second chances. So i was hoping i could get that second chance. And i swear that ill try not to spam. I understand the hard work that’s needed to keep this community alive and ill do my best make it easier.</p>
<p>Also, the IRC thing, everybody was ignoring me and i needed someone to talk to. Sorry daiki and everyone else. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
