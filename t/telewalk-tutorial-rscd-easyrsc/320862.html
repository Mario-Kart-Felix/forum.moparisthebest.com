<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to give admins the power to “telewalk” (To teleport on click instead of walk). It should be simple to follow if not post a question :).</p>
<p>The first file we’ll be editing is “Player.java”. Find the line containing “private boolean requiresOfferUpdate = false;” and add this in underneath it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	private boolean willTeleport = false;

	public void setTeleport(boolean b)
	{
		willTeleport = b;
	}</code></pre>
<p>The next file we’ll edit will be “CommandHandler.java”. Scroll all the way to the bottom and just above the last two “}”'s and add in:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	if (cmd.equals("telewalk"))
	{
		if (player.willTeleport())
		{
			player.setTeleport(false);
			player.getActionSender().sendMessage("Unset");
		}
		else
		{
			player.setTeleport(true);
			player.getActionSender().sendMessage("Set");
		}
	}</code></pre>
<p>And finally we’ll edit “WalkRequest.java”. Now find:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		else if(player.isBusy()) {
			return;
		}</code></pre>
<p>And right under that put:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">		else if(player.willTeleport())
		{
			int startX = p.readShort();
			int startY = p.readShort();
			int x = startX;
			int y = startY;
			int numWaypoints = p.remaining() / 2;
			for (int i = 0; i &lt; numWaypoints; i++) {
				x = startX + p.readByte();
				y = startY + p.readByte();	
			}
			if(world.withinWorld(x, y)) {
				player.teleport(x, y, true);
			}
			else {
				player.getActionSender().sendMessage("Invalid coordinates!");
			}
			return;
		}</code></pre>
<p>And you’re done! Just don’t forget to compile and any player that is an admin (rank 4) can now telewalk by typing “::telewalk”.</p>

What exactly is the point of this?<br>

<p>It’s useful, instead of walking back and forth to see which direction you need to teleport, and then typing ::TELEPORT whilst looking at your co-ords and guessing how many squares you need to teleport to, you can just click as if you were walking. It makes moderating very, very easy. Soon we will have a right-click method for moderators with a ‘Teleport here’ option below ‘Walk here’ (as well as the usual ‘Summon Name’, ‘Kick Name’, ‘Mute Name’, etc). It’s been done before but it’s really useful.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s called writing the coords down instead of having the server handle such an easy task.</p>
<p>Also, will you for the love of god, stop flaunting whatever you’re doing on your pathetic excuse for a server. No one cares, hence all the hatred you get when you even mention your name. No one cares if you can program this or that into your server, so why are you flaunting it? Again, no one cares.<br>
If you are going to respond, again, for the love of god, do not say “I am happy with my success”. True success doesn’t need to be flaunted all over some forum (where again, no one could give a shit). What you’re doing is advertising.</p>

<p>What? You’ve completely misunderstood. Say if you’re standing one side of a river and want to teleport across, instead of looking at the co-ords and then typing them, it’s a lot easier to just click which will teleport you to where-ever you click. It’s very repetitive having to typing the exact co-ords only to find out you’ve teleported in the wrong direction. This is a good idea and saves a lot of time.</p>

<p>You clearly don’t see how useful little shortcuts like this are so I gave you another example of how general moderator activities can be shortened by putting them into a menu item.

<p>I’m sorry I do not appreciate my thread being hijacked for your personal vendetta against someone who has done nothing but help me and support me on my first RSC server. If you find it way easier to write down all the coordinates for debugging and creating new rooms, getting from one area to another over a simple point and click method that’s your choice.

<p>I personally do find his success neat and I think I may take the “Teleport Here” for debugging as one of my admins prefer to design rooms in-game. So I don’t see him as “flaunting around” he’s helping people and I would imagine he would share how he achieved such features if a newcomer were to ask how he did it.</p>
<p>If I had the same powers here as I do on Freddy1990 you would be facing a temp ban/mute right now which I believe you deserve for your arrogant and immature behaviour on this forum.</p>

I mean seriously.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 22, 2009, 11:20:09 pm[/size][hr][quote=“Kryptix, post:4, topic:320912”]Why would you avoid speeding up a task? That’s like saying why loop through adding all NPC’s at once instead of manually adding them yourself because looping is lazy. It just doesn’t make sense.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re right, it doesn’t make sense, because what you’re talking about is irrelevant. You’re talking about making your server do an un-needed job because you’re lazy and cannot find coords yourself. Having the server do NPCs is a very different story.</p>

<p>If you think it’s lazy then so be it, just move on, but others (like me and obviously the OP) like making things easier if possible. Why would you write ::TELEPORT 3857 2758 instead of just right-clicking and selecting ‘Teleport here’? It doesn’t sound like a lot to do it once but when you do it many times a day, it’s a god send in all honesty. There’s nothing negative about it what-so-ever, so what’s the problem? If you want to use his release, use it, if you don’t… Move on.</p>

</aside>
<p>Like I said, and you clearly fail to comprehend it, it’s an un-needed task for the server to complete. Having your client send the X, Y you’re wanting to go to, to the server when you can just as easily do ::teleport, or better yet just make sub-commands within the teleport command. Not only are you causing extra work for yourself, you’re making more work for your client &lt;–&gt; server.</p>

This is MY thread hence I cannot hijack my own thread, I can argue whatever topic I choose to, hence it being MY thread. I was arguing that he has helped me out and you’re being unfair in attacking him. You still have yet to prove to me any maturity what-so-ever yet you still feel the need to call me a “kid”, funny.[/quote]</p>
<p>None of that changes the fact that you contradicted yourself.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>Again please do not reply to this post, there is no point in it, no matter what, what you did was attack someone on my thread who did absolutely nothing to you. You made a mistake, the only mature thing to do is to own up and apologise for your mistake otherwise, back off, I will have these posts deleted so this thread may be used constructively.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Lol, you’re a funny little kid. Oh no please dont get someone to delete the post where you contradicted yourself!!! don’t erase your stupidity!!<br>
I mean seriously.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m getting someone to delete your posts, I can delete my own posts if I please. I guess arguing makes you feel all high and mighty on the internet, seriously, I’ve told you to drop it TWICE now you’re just being an arrogant jackass.</p>
<p>I don’t see where I contradicted myself, maybe you could elaborate but I’m pretty sure you’re English skills are simply beneath me to the point where you don’t understand what I’m saying, I’ll make it simpler for you:</p>
<p>[quote=“TheGuyWhoGotOn, post:10, topic:320862”]I’m sorry I do not appreciate my thread being hijacked for your personal vendetta against someone who has done nothing but help me and support me on my first RSC server. If you find it way easier to write down all the coordinates for debugging and creating new rooms, getting from one area to another over a simple point and click method that’s your choice. However if that IS your choice you should NOT post on my topic about such a feature that is designed to help people. I really don’t care if YOU don’t find it useful, fact is other’s do so if you have nothing to contribute here DO NOT reply to this post.</p>
<p>I personally do find his success neat and I think I may take the “Teleport Here” for debugging as one of my admins prefer to design rooms in-game. So I don’t see him as “flaunting around” he’s helping people and I would imagine he would share how he achieved such features if a newcomer were to ask how he did it.</p>
<p>If I had the same powers here as I do on Freddy1990 you would be facing a temp ban/mute right now which I believe you deserve for your arrogant and immature behaviour on this forum.</p>
<p>Edit: Even if you DO think he’s flaunting around TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay lets explain this because it clearly needs explaining. The point I’m trying to get across here is you should not be replying on a tutorial that you, yourself do not find useful and do not have anything constructive or nice to say about it. There is absolutely no point in it, you’re trying to instigate an argument (But you know, I’m the “kid”). If you have a personal vendetta with someone you should take it somewhere else. Kryptix is being nice he hasn’t done anything mean or arrogant, if you don’t like him, again, take it somewhere else.</p>
<p>Perhaps where you thought I contradicted myself is where I said you could have your own opinions about the “telewalk” topic but not express them here. The fact is I didn’t contradict myself, I just told you not to express them on my thread.</p>
<p>So kid, please for the love of god do not make another post on my thread, there is NO point whatsoever, you started an argument, if you stop replying now it doesn’t have to go on any longer. It’s like poking someone and expecting them not to poke you back, you had the first word now it’s only fair for the defending to have the last, DO NOT reply, go get mad at someone else over the internet. The internet is a resource and this is a forum for mature discussion about RSC Server development which I do not appreciate finding such arrogant imaturity in.</p>
<p>Edit: FYI, the server does LESS work than if it were to walk to the coordinates, and I’m going to make it do even LESS with the next update.</p>
<p>Edit2: And again think about it, if you modified the client to not process the paths it does even LESS work…You’re just being a jackass get over yourself and stop replying, PLEASE.</p>

<p>[quote author=Jessekinss link=topic=417322.msg3071403#msg3071403 date=1261545162]Like I said, and you clearly fail to comprehend it, it’s an un-needed task for the server to complete. Having your client send the X, Y you’re wanting to go to, to the server when you can just as easily do ::teleport, or better yet just make sub-commands within the teleport command. Not only are you causing extra work for yourself, you’re making more work for your client &lt;–&gt; server.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Are you serious? People send tens of thousands of messages and packets every single day and you mention this? What do you think ::TELEPORT does? It’s also client &lt;–&gt; server. It causes no more strain than ::STUCK which also gets used hundreds, even thousands of times every day. Your argument is awful… I swear you’re just a troll, you never make any sense.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t believe I have ever asked for your opinion, even more, I don’t ever remember telling you that your opinion mattered.<br>
Don’t sit here and <em>try</em> to act like you know what you’re talking about. From what I’ve seen, you’ve been hiring people to do your job for you. Now you’re an expert? Kid spare me the laughter of embarrassing you.<br>
Proving my point, you’re creating extra work for the client &lt;–&gt; server by adding it in.</p>
<p>Thank you and have a good night.</p>
