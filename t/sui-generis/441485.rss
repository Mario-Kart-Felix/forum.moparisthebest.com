    <description>[center][b]Introduction:[/b][/center]

- [i]First off, you may be wandering, &quot;What does sui generis mean?&quot; It is another word for &#39;unique&#39;. Anyways, lets get started. I was browsing through the download section and I came across the &quot;Triton Framework&quot; thread. It has inspired me to &#39;branch out&#39; a bit. I am attempting to write my own framework as well. However, stick with me. This is going to be a bumpy ride.[/i]

[b]Updates:[/b]

[code]5/5/12 - Logging in
5/5/12 - completed player rendering[/code]

[b]Note:[/b] [i]I know this thread is a bit bare, however, I am not that far into this project. Pictures will come soon, not that there is anything to show.[/i]</description>

              <p>I wouldn’t use Trition. Simply because, when we (myself &amp; a few others) were writing the framework, we couldn’t stay on one task.</p>
<p>And no one was doing log in, we were doing every bit of content, when we couldn’t even log in yet! It was crazy, it’s old, none of the content is implemented other than packet handling, tons of empty classes, etc.</p>
<p>I’d suggesting starting completely from scratch.</p>
