    <description>I have been writing a Java-based Path Tracer recently.

Here is my current result:

Edit: I forgot, it maybe should have been posted in the Java section instead.</description>

<p>I just added Gouraud shading rather than just Flat shading to triangle meshes, as well as the ability to use multiple materials and textures on one triangle mesh. Some new screenshots have been uploaded to the website presented above.</p>

<p>Edit: Actually, new updates were added yesterday. It’s now possible to switch between “realtime”- and normal-rendering. The realtime rendering is currently not that fast, hence the quotation marks. But there are many configuration-options in the code that can make it faster. They are not exposed in the UI at this time. And, you can’t move the camera yet either.</p>
<p>Edit: More has been comitted to GitHub. Now it’s possible to walk around using your WASD-keys. Realtime rendering is now done without actual Path Tracing. It just returns the “albedo” color of the surfaces themselves, so it’s faster.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>About anti-aliasing; it has anti-aliasing, but I don’t really know why the light is not anti-aliased as you could expect. I must have done something wrong there. But I have plans to fix it at some point.</p>
<p>Path Tracing is a form of Ray Tracing, in that it casts rays from each pixel into the scene. The primary rays are what constitutes Ray Casting (another more simple algorithm). Ray Tracing and Path Tracing both cast more rays, so called secondary rays, from each surface intersection point. In contrast to Path Tracing, Ray Tracing has to cast so called shadow rays, in order to determine whether the intersection point is visible. Path Tracing treats each and every shape in the scene as a light source (or emitter). But one inherent difference between the two, is that Path Tracing casts rays in a random direction in the hemisphere of the surface normal of the surface intersection point (and from the pixel itself). So it’s a Global Illumination (GI) solution to the rendering equation.</p>
<p>The anti-aliasing is done by 2x2 pixel sub-sampling.</p>
<p>You’re right in that Path Tracing gradually makes the image look better. It converges to the correct solution.</p>
<p>I test it by simply starting the program. It updates all the time. So I can see the image pretty much immediately. Although it will have a lot of noise in the beginning. The longer it runs, the less noise will be reduced, as there are less noise to reduce.</p>
<p>Edit: I actually found a fix for the anti-aliasing issue with the lights. If I render to a larger image and then down-sample it to the expected resolution, it works. It’s a form of Supersampling.</p>

              <p>This looks very neat! Though, I’m curious - how come there isn’t any anti-aliasing? I’m not too familiar with how this works, other than this style of rendering is known as “baking” and the longer it’s baked, the better the scene looks. But since the rays surely work on a geometry-based/sub-sampling basis, shouldn’t the edges of lights and such be smooth? Also how did you test this if a scene took 10 hours <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Also, while this is HLSL and not GLSL, <a href="http://www.humus.name/index.php?page=3D&amp;ID=82" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">there are ways of cheating recursion on the GPU</a>. Not sure how applicable that’d be though.</p>

              <p>EcoPS GM: Thanks! My plans are to support interaction using a movable camera. But for this to work practically, the quality of the graphics most certainly has to be lowered. At least for the time being. The images shown took around 10 hours to render on my fast laptop.</p>
<p>Eyeownyew: Thanks! I have plans to port the Path Tracer to OpenCL. A few months ago I even tested using a library or framework called Aparapi, which transforms Java bytecode to OpenCL code on-the-fly. It turned out to be pretty hard to get the algorithm to work, as there are many limitations in both Aparapi and what can be done in OpenCL. You can’t, for instance, use recursion in OpenCL (or on the GPU for that matter).</p>

… just because there’s a java icon in the image means this should be in the java programming section? I disagree. The java programming section should be questions/topics relating to the java programming language itself.

<p><span class="mention">@object</span>: This is actually very impressive. Do you plan on making the ray tracer interactive? That would be neat. Is this project for learning purposes, or for something specific?</p>
