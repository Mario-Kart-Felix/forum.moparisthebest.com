    <title>How would I make this feature send a duel request but no interface?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-make-this-feature-send-a-duel-request-but-no-interface/177564</link>
    <description>Okay, on my server, I have this fun fight feature, What happens, is when someone right clicks on a player, and click fun fight, it teleports them and the player to a funfight area. People are getting annoyed because people teleport them when they don&#39;t want to be teleported. 

How do I make it, so that when someone click funfight on someone, it says &quot;playername wishes to duel with you&quot;, but instead of the duel interface to come up, when the click &quot;playername wishes to duel with you&quot;, it will teleport them. I don&#39;t want the interface to come up.

How would I do this?

Thanks

This is my case 153, here it is:

[code]         case 153: //Fun Fight
if(funfightoff == 0) {
         		AttackingOn = inStream.readSignedWordBigEndian();
		client play2 = (client) server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn];
			if((playerRights &lt;= 3) &amp;&amp; (funfight == 0) &amp;&amp; (play2.funfight == 0) &amp;&amp; (!infunfight())) {
				play2.funfight = 1;
				funfight = 1;
				play2.teleportToX = 2795;
				play2.teleportToY = 3321;
				teleportToX = 2793;
				teleportToY = 3321;
                		NewHP = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
                		setSkillLevel(3, getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]), playerXP[playerHitpoints]);
                		playerLevel[3] = getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]);
                		play2.NewHP = play2.getLevelForXP(play2.playerXP[3]);
                		play2.setSkillLevel(3, play2.getLevelForXP(play2.playerXP[3]), play2.playerXP[play2.playerHitpoints]);
                		play2.playerLevel[3] = play2.getLevelForXP(play2.playerXP[3]);
                        	play2.refreshSkills();
                        	refreshSkills();
				sendMessage(&quot;You are getting teled to The Fun Fight Area !&quot;);
				play2.sendMessage(playerName+&quot; has challenged you for a fun fight !&quot;);
				play2.sendMessage(&quot;You are getting teled to The Fun Fight Area !&quot;);
} else if((playerRights &lt;= 3) &amp;&amp; (funfight != 0) &amp;&amp; (play2.funfight != 0) &amp;&amp; (!infunfight())) {
	sendMessage(&quot;You have challenged &quot;+play2.playerName+&quot; ...&quot;);
	sendMessage(&quot;... But you or &quot;+play2.playerName+&quot; already had a fight!&quot;);
	play2.sendMessage(playerName+&quot; had challenged you ...&quot;);
	play2.sendMessage(&quot;... But you or &quot;+playerName+&quot; allready had a fight!&quot;);
	funfight = 0;
	play2.funfight = 0;
	sendMessage(&quot;You can now challenge or be challenged again !&quot;);
	play2.sendMessage(&quot;You can now challenge or be challenged again !&quot;);
} else if((playerRights &lt;= 3) &amp;&amp; (funfight != 0) &amp;&amp; (play2.funfight != 0) &amp;&amp; (infunfight())) {
	sendMessage(&quot;You have challenged &quot;+play2.playerName);
	play2.sendMessage(playerName+&quot; has challenged you ... !&quot;);
	sendMessage(&quot;... But you already have a fight , tele off the isle and try again !&quot;);
	play2.sendMessage(&quot;... But you already have a fight , tele off the isle and try again !&quot;);
} 
           } else
if(funfightoff == 1) {
sendMessage(&quot;Fun fight is currently disabled. Please try again later.&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;Or you can ask an administrator to enable it.&quot;);
} else {
if (!nonWild()) {
sendMessage(&quot;You must be out of the wilderness to use Funfight.&quot;);
sendMessage(&quot;Please leave the wilderness before using the Funfight feature.&quot;);
}
}
break; [/code]</description>
