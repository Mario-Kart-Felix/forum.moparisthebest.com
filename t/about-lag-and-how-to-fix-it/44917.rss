    <title>About lag-and how to fix it. :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-lag-and-how-to-fix-it/44917</link>
    <description>Intoduction-This guide is about telling people about lag,how bad it can be,what &quot;lag&quot; is,and how to fix it.

Q1-Every time I try to go on the server I made,using a source,not hybirdscape,It blacks out the screen and It won&#39;t let me log in.

A1-Close moparscape,put the server offline,close all internet browsers and close all folders.Now,re-start your computer,after it&#39;s re-started,give it a disk defragmentation,update your fire-wall,and have a virus scan,and delete junk-email.Now,with pretty much all harmfull things that can harm your computer erased,re-start the computer,and try your server again.Make sure you are using everything you need,have the right port,IP and if it&#39;s on HAM turn on HAM.It should work fine now.

( If it&#39;s still not working,buy a new computer ).

_______

Q2-I&#39;m doing fine on my server,but other people lag? WHY?

A2-It&#39;s probably because your server ping doesn&#39;t meet thier computer Ping requirements.I&#39;m afraid you might have to delete some of the editing because,for them it&#39;s getting harder for thier connection to connect to your server because so much editing is in between,causing them to lag.

Another thing is because their computer is too old,or they have a virus.Give them an emaik/AIM/MSN messange and tell them to do what I told you to do if you lag,above.

_______

Q3-I keep lagging on my server,but other people don&#39;t,why?

A3-Ok,do Q1 and A1.

________

Q4-My server just closed without me doing anything..!?!??

A4-Make sure you don&#39;t have any auto-clickers programmed to click a close button lolz.Or someone has emailed a virus to you making them control your computer.If this does occur,LISTEN TO THIS IMMEDIATLY-DELETE IT,UPDATE EVERYTHING,AND MAKE SURE YOU&#39;R REAL LIFE SAVINGS ARE SILL IN THE BANK-THEY MIGHT HAVE WIPED ALL THE STUFF IN YOUR BANK AND TRANSFERED IT TO THIERS-IN REAL LIFE.
If this happens,well,your screwed.
_______

Q5-I&#39;m doing everything right,I did all the above you told me to do,but my server&#39;s not working,why?.

A5-You may not have the latest java plug-in installed in your computer,if you do,declear you have it to your computer.Or,it may not recognize java as a safe file,and may not let you use it.Or you can&#39;t open the file without winRAR,or ZIP.Maybe you have a virus. Follow Q1 and A1 insructions.
