    <description>problem: massers are really ruining my server economy.


solution: i was hoping of a solution of when they click over a certain speed, it disconnects them, but every time it disconnects, it adds a blackmark or something in a file, and than once they do it like 10 times, the account is locked automatically.. thats what i was hoping for, but i am also fine with a basic, if they click to fast it just keeps disconnecting them. thanks!!!</description>
