    <title>Make your own GFX?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-your-own-gfx/278179</link>
    <description>I have searched the forums and the web for a software or TuT explaining how to create your own GFX.  
Now I haven&#39;t found any posts that have helped me the slightest bit so I have resorted to asking for help.

If someone could link me to TuT for this or just link me up to a site which explains briefly how to do this that would be great.
If there is no way to make your own GFX then yea, thankyou anyway.

Oh and I 3D Model and code so yer I don&#39;t need to be spoon fed it alright.</description>

              <p>If you 3D model you should know this. I’m pretty sure it’s the same as making a custom model you just use class23 to add it as a gfx.</p>
