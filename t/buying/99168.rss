There is a <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-i">GREAT</span></span></span> one already out there. But it ain’t cheap, around 1000k (1 Million) GP it will cost though. Made by Starblaster100, a professional scripter. It features super Anti-Ban, Super Random Detection (SRL), Can run on multiple accounts and more…</p>
<p>If you want a free one, you may check out Wizzup?'s one. It it located on the <a href="http://srl-forums.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">SRL-Forums</a> (Another pro scripter, co-owner of SRL. But not as good as Starblasters Ess Miner).</p>
