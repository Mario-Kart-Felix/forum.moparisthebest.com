              <p>First Off I dont think your ready to have a server plus if your new theres no way your going to code a blank source.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions</p>
<p>Do you Have you Server ready to run?<br>
Have you portforwarded? (THERE ARE MANY GUIDES IN THE TUTORIAL SECTION)<br>
Are you evan running your server?</p>
<p>You must be specific If you need help</p>
