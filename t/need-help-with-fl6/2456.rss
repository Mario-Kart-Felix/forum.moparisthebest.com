    <title>Need help with FL6</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-fl6/2456</link>
    <description>Hey,

I used to fuck around with FL5. Not really doing anything. Now im getting serious and Ive gotten 6.0.

But all I can make is patterns and yes thats fine. But then I go to the playlist and try to put them together and stuff and it will not save it or play it. I dunno, I tried help, and it sucked. I&#39;m a total noob at this, but I would like to learn and I need some help since I&#39;m just starting out.

Thanks</description>
