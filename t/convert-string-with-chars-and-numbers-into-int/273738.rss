    <title>Convert String (with chars and numbers) into int?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/convert-string-with-chars-and-numbers-into-int/273738</link>
    <description>Well I have been trying to convert a string such as &quot;42fha6sd4&quot; into an int 4264 to ignore everything except numbers and save it as an int. Is there any way to do this?

The reason why I need this is because I&#39;m trying to use the showInputDialog in JOptionPane and when you enter information into showInputDialog it returns it as a string. But I need the user to pick a number and compare that number to different number to see if it is less than, greater than, or equal to it.

By the way, this is a guessing game. The computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100 and stores it in an int &quot;answer&quot; and in a String named &quot;answerString.&quot; Here is the method I&#39;m using at the moment:

[code]
    private void guess()
    {

        String guessString = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(frame, &quot;Guess a number&quot; +
                                        &quot; between 1 and 100&quot;, &quot;Guess A Number&quot;,
                                        3);                   
                                     
        if(guessString != null &amp;&amp; !(guessString.equals(&quot;&quot;))) {  
        int guess = Integer.parseInt(guessString);  // this is where the error happens I think
            if(guessString.equals(answerString)) {
                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, &quot;You got it right!&quot;, &quot;You Win!&quot;, 1);
                } 
            else if(guess &lt; answer) {
                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, &quot;Too low. Try again.&quot;, &quot;Too Low&quot;, 1);
                }
            else if(guess &gt; answer) {
                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(frame, &quot;Too high. Try again.&quot;, &quot;Too High&quot;, 1);
            }
        }
    }
[/code]

If they were to enter letters (such as f) in it, it gives this big error:

[code]

So to summarize, I want to turn String &quot;5dff4uaise3&quot; and others like it into int 543. I want to only keep numbers the user has inputted.

Thanks in advance,
FireEater93[br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 15, 2009, 10:44:32 pm[/size][hr]So I have to break up the string into characters then test those individual characters to see if they are digits, keep the digits, then put that into an int?</description>

<p>The method [tt]parseInt(java.lang.String)[/tt] in the Integer class attempts to parse an integer value from the String provided. Now, you see, occasionally the input provided will not follow the expectations of a standard integer. Additional characters (i.e. ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘%’, "^’) will be thrown in rendering the integer invalid. When this occurs, an exception is thrown by the name of [tt]java.lang.NumberFormatException[/tt]; I’m sure the name is self-explanatory. Using the aforementioned process, one is able to identify the occasional invalid integer and return some sort of response if wanted.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ahhh, thank you. I was wondering if there was any use for exceptions. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I can’t wait to try this in my program.

<p>Answering the OP’s question does not mean that I agree with what he’s doing! How this train of thought popped up in this thread is beyond me. There is no “unlimitedorb’s method” and there is no “frank_'s method”. There’s absolutely nothing here that hasn’t been done before.[/quote]<br>
sry but this is a forum, not wikianswers<br>
theres nothing saying one cant make a suggestion, and if frank hadn’t made that suggestion OP would still be using that silly method instead of what he really wanted.</p>

<p>The method [tt]parseInt(java.lang.String)[/tt] in the Integer class attempts to parse an integer value from the String provided. Now, you see, occasionally the input provided will not follow the expectations of a standard integer. Additional characters (i.e. ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘%’, "^’) will be thrown in rendering the integer invalid. When this occurs, an exception is thrown by the name of [tt]java.lang.NumberFormatException[/tt]; I’m sure the name is self-explanatory. Using the aforementioned process, one is able to identify the occasional invalid integer and return some sort of response if wanted.</p>

<p>Yeah but with the little knowledge I have of Java, I wouldn’t know how to prevent them from typing in anything that’s not a number. Also, if I did do that I would have to check that it only contains 0-9 but it does not neccessarily have to contain all of them.</p>
<p>[quote=“frank_, post:3, topic:273738”]how about making that 48 and 57 ‘0’ and ‘9’ respectively, so you know what the hell they are meant to represent</p>
<p>i would be more inclined to do something along the lines of</p>
<p><code>
// prompt
int guess = 0;
boolean valid = false;
try {
  guess = Integer.parseInt(input);
  valid = true;
} catch (NumberFormatException e)
  valid = false;
}
if (!valid) {
  // maybe inform incorrent
} else {
  // check answer
}</code>[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you! That’s perfect! I had heard about the try and catch methods but I wasn’t really sure how to implement them. I’ll try this and see how it works.</p>

For example: a table used for some sort of hashing algorithm (or anything else that floats your boat) consisting of only the values of each character used would not only look ugly, but it would not be understandable to the average person - that is, unless you’re some freak who decided memorizing the values would be a fun thing to do.</p>

<p>Okay the compiler has to do a little extra work. I haven’t looked at javac closely enough but I would assume that the ’ mark is one token. The character another and the ’ mark yet another. Meanwhile a series of numbers would be interpreted as a single token (an integer).</p>
<p>I’m not sure about you but TWO! (only possibly) extra tokens would cost you… NOTHING!</p>
<p>As previously covered the runtime performance is the same.</p>
<p>So we sacrifice readability for… 0.00001ns of compile time performance?</p>
