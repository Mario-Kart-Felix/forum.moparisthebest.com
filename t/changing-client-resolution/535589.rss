    <title>Changing client resolution</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-client-resolution/535589</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to change my client&#39;s resolution for some time now. Currently, I can change the actual window resolution, but the game is still small.
Ex: Original resolution is 765x503. [img]http://i.imgur.com/GevtKbP.png[/img]

But I want it to be interchangeable (currently trying 1600x900)

But it just does that.

In GUI.JAVA, I&#39;ve changed 
[code]
gamePanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(765, 503));  to
gamePanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(1600, 900));
[/code]

The server/client is 317 PI (please don&#39;t hate.)

I&#39;ve looked through GUI, RSSocket, RSInterface, RSImageProducer, RSFrame, RSFont, and RSApplet, and searched the whole folder with anything regarding width, height, and resolution. Also, I&#39;ve googled to no avail.

Could anyone help me with this problem? Thank you in advance, and I apologize if this is the wrong section.</description>
