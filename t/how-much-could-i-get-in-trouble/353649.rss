              <p>Why did you bump this? Its already been answered.<br>
If Jagex targets you they will ask you to shut everything down. If you refuse they will take legal actions against you. There is a very small chance that Jagex will target you though. What more could you possibly need to know that hasn’t already been posted?</p>

JaGeX owns anything related to RS that was produced and programmed by them, they don’t really care as long as you’re not making profits from it, because that’s basically stealing money from them.<br>
I mean if you had like a bot along with the server that was used for RS, then yeah they’d come after you, I’ve seen and played many allstar-scape bases and they where hosted 2+ weeks and JaGeX never came after them, so you really have nothing to worry about as long as it’s for "learning experiences " and non-profitable.<br>
[/quote]I don’t believe two weeks in long enough for JaGeX to discover the server.</p>
<p>JaGeX usually goes for the top servers first.<br>
The ones that have their own websites, dedi’s, and massive player amount.</p>
<p>Also, JaGeX doesn’t just care about the profits.<br>
They also care for the player base to which they are losing/have lost.[/quote]Yes, but I had a allstar-scape server which I had fixed up a tad bit, had about 65 players on daily, after a while JaGeX contacted me via my websites email and asked me to take my donation banner down, didn’t try to shut me down, and yes they do go after the big servers with huge player amounts, doesn’t mean they will always get shut down, look at battlescape <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

EDIT: Also, the servers are LEGAL. The server has been programmed from scatch out of ones own knowledge all it does is send and recieve messages from the client, and iirc Jagex dropped the copyright laws on the 317 client because they’re old and they updated to the 400+'s.<br>

<p>JaGeX still owns a copyright on the 317 protocol, client, and cache.</p>

<p>The Servers are legal, they are 100% Java, making them not illegal.</p>

<p>The Servers are simply just (For example, on a 317) A ServerSocket waiting for connections from A client… This could be used for many different purposes. There is nothing illegal with the Server.</p>

<p>Also, like I said, the Client is the only bit that could be illegal as the Server is 100% legal. So therefore I conclude that I personally think that… Nothing at all will ever happen if you are hosting a private server as long as you’re not gaining from it, EG; Profit.</p>
