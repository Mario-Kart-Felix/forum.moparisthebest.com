    <title>Exp</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/exp/222891</link>
    <description>Well, the answer to this is probably very simple but I cannot seem to figure it out, I fixed the exp rates for my combat skills BUT I need to know how to change the exp rates on non-combat skills, EX: Runecrafting. Whenever I try to change the exp rates on Runecrafting so that training it goes slower nothing happens, I asked a friend and he told me to edit the cases; well I went to the case for the Nature Altar and found nothing having to do with exp. If anybody could help me out on changing exp rates for non-combat skills, it&#39;d be greatly appreciated.</description>

              <p>What I do is… Lets say the the thing that is non combat like the altar id is 5555 (its not) then you search 5555 if its something like a stall it will say case 5555 under it add skillxp 1700 change the skill exp to lower if its not in a case then just search it or an item used on it youll see “add skillxp” change the number by that</p>

              <p>OK, this is a little harder than Cmbt xp.</p>
<p>What you want to do is go into your client.java and search for the skill you want to edit.<br>
EX: Woodcutting</p>
<p>I would search “woodcutting” and i’d get a bunch of wc stuff.<br>
its different for every server so just do that and scroll down until you find the exp for it and then save, compile, and run and your done <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
