    <title>How can I Link the Special Bar to a Skill (Such as Prayer and Hp)? [Delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-link-the-special-bar-to-a-skill-such-as-prayer-and-hp-delta/473896</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been searching both the hitpoint and prayer skill properties to find how when they drain it also makes the skill level drain (I don&#39;t know a single term to describe the process, please correct me.),  but I haven&#39;t had any luck.  Could anyone point me to some properties in code that I could apply to this.

If you&#39;re wondering: I&#39;m converting RC to Mana/Summoning (coming up with a name).

Also:  I&#39;ve done the same search with the properties of strength, I&#39;m trying to apply it&#39;s properties to fletching (being converted to another skill as well) to make your range hits depend on your fletching level.

I&#39;m not trying to be spoon-fed, but I could use better hints than I have gotten with Ctrl + H.

All help is appreciated. Thanks!</description>

              <p>That’s what I’ve been doing so far, but luckily while waiting for replies I’ve managed to at least get fletching to determine ranged strength and made the special recharge rate dependent on your RC level.  Hopefully I’ll figure the rest out.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

              <p>[quote=“darthbonsly, post:3, topic:473896”]For Runecrafting: When a player loses Hitpoints or Prayer points, the level also drains on the skill menu/icon (again with my bad termology). I’m trying to apply this to Runecrafting when a player does various things such as using special attacks or casting certain spells.</p>
<p>For Fletching: I’m trying to make your fletching level have the same impact on your ranged attacks as strength does to your melle attacks, and perhaps even make it raise your combat level in the same way (along with xp gains to fletching during ranged combat).[/quote]<br>
Fletching: You’d have to rewrite the combat level calculations for it to be included. You’d also have to create a multiplyer of some sort for it. Look into strengths for melee.</p>
<p>RC: Look at the methods that drain the special bar. Use those to create your methods for your new one. Same goes for the point drain.</p>
