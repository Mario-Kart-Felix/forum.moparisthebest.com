    <title>Which Source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-source/286301</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to run 508&#39;s (stock) to no avail. All my 317&#39;s work though. 

So my question... I am looking for a good stabil source, that is not focused on PKing. I don&#39;t mind if the wildy allows it, however i do NOT want it everywhere. 

Also, i want the server to be as close to real RS as possible, with the exception of faster XP. Other perks are alright too, but I don&#39;t want the towns/NPC&#39;s to be misplaced too much. 

I was recently playing a server that has been taken down called WebsterScape. That was as close to what i wanted as ever, however i don&#39;t know which source they were using. 

Thanks!</description>

              <p>My point being that there isn’t too much modification to the layout and NPC’s. I dont want it to have 50 npc’s all standing around you when you log in. I don’t want dragons standing in varrock where they shouldn’t be. I don’t mind the fact that things will not be included, but i don’t want the things included to be completely different than RS is.</p>
