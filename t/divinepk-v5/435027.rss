    <description>I&#39;ve played runescape classic since the beginning. I recently decided I wanted to mess around with my own server just to try things out. Well, I&#39;m stumped. I read dayles forum online telling me pretty much everything I need to know, but I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s wrong. It says both the servers are offline and anytime I try to log in the connection times out. I have my ports set at 43595 and 80, I have wamp, jdk, and apache-ant all downloaded and put where they are supposed to be. The main thing that I&#39;m concerned with I have done wrong, is possibly the pots, or editing the sever run.bat. The apache-ant is correct, but I&#39;m not entirely sure that the java has been put in correctly. Any help would be much appreciated. I&#39;m very new to this and I know I most likely sound nubbish to all of you guys.</description>

              <p>When your running the Server.bat are you getting any errors? Also you may have forwarded your ports incorrectly, Try <a href="http://www.canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.canyouseeme.org</a> to check there open correctly.</p>

<p>Probably you messed up something while setting up your login server.</p>
<p>You could go with something like this <a href="http://uppit.com/v/LGF5M4ZP" rel="nofollow noopener">http://uppit.com/v/LGF5M4ZP</a><br>
then after you get used to the source move to a more updated server like darquest or moparclasic.</p>
