    <description>I can afford Sponsership on mopar, I have a dedicated server ready, everything setup just the source needed now and someone to work beside me and we&#39;re ready to go.

              <p>Id have to agree “heatrn11” you should really make a development desciption, include like what you would like to create e.g.</p>
<p>-what revision?<br>
-applications?<br>
-what you plan to have in the source<br>
-eco/spawn?</p>
<p>so many more things you need.</p>
<p>also i dont think it would be that hard for you to go through the download section and find a source and client, by the sounds of it your only asking for someone to work by your side am i right? so this means you should have the source and client ready to go and should be asking for somene that can code to help out, its very rare to see someone have a dedicated server and sponser ready?? before they evan have a source and client to use. you should think about what you post before you post it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and shouldnt waste your money on a dedicated server without evan having your source all sorted and coded to how you imagine u wanted it.</p>
