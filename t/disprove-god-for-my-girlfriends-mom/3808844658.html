        <p>Oh yeah I didn’t mean to imply that it was magic, but to assume that anything we don’t understand doesn’t exist seems a little short sighted.</p>

<p>I find both of those ridiculous too.  I’ve never understood how a believer in a loving God could presume to make decisions for God and decide whether people will go to heaven or hell, like it is their decision.  Idiots…</p>

In contrast; I know that god does not exist and I say this with certainty.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m with you except for this part. You don’t know that, at all. If you assert that then you’re as bad as a believer, imo.[/quote]</p>
<p>No. When a believer says they believe in God they’re saying they believe in a story book that’s been passed down for ~2000 years now despite the fact there has and never will be evidence for this “God” other than a book written by human beings (which if you use your brain can be determined as a method of controlling a population when science was less understood). How can I be as bad as them, all I’m saying is I’ve never seen any evidence of this thing, therefore it does not exist. Like dragons, witches, wizards, gryphon’s and Harry fucking Potter.</p>
<p>The only reason I assert it is because this topic asked me too. I NEVER force my atheist beliefs on people, ever. As an atheist I couldn’t give a flying fuck what garbage you want to believe in. If you ask me for my opinion I will express it and I did.</p>
<p>Also Cain_ clearly knows and expressed the logical contradictions of God, so no need to go there.</p>
<blockquote>Are you implying that we have a full understanding of physics and science today?  Maybe I missed the big announcement, but I'm pretty sure no one knows what is at the bottom of the oceans, what is at the center of the earth, what caused the 'big bang', if and where there is other life in the universe, or even what could possibly cause life to come to be, along with a multitude of other things, surely more than we actually think that we know about.</blockquote>
<p>Well since you mention the centre of the earth, it seems like you come from 2000 years ago. Iron and Nickel, have long been determined to make up the centre of the eath by variations in sound wave propagation. It might be a theory, but it’s sound. More proven than God for instance and this is what pisses me off about this debate. You’re being totally unreasonable, of course we have a better scientific understanding now than back then. We don’t have a full understanding but I didn’t mean to nor do I think I implied that. The interesting thing is your ready to turn round to me and say “what caused the big bang, bottom of the oceans, is there other life in the universe?” and you have a fair point. I don’t know. I know the maths though, M-Theory covers the big bang theory, and the statistical probability is that there is definitely aliens and lots of them. Now these aren’t proven but there is enough maths for a logical person to understand and accept the theory. God however has no evidence, no maths yet you say to me I’m the one talking about stuff we don’t fully understand? Are you serious? How can you question theories based on maths and science when what you believe in has theories based on what is essentially, and pardon my abruptness, fuck-all.</p>
<blockquote>Really?  I don't think much has changed at all.  We all have to work in order to eat, we eat the same way (food -&gt; mouth), we sleep the same way, we love the same way, we shit the same way, we put our pants on in the morning the same way, we pretty much do everything the same as we used to millions of years ago or however long ago you think humans came into existence.  We have learned things, invented things, but that doesn't change us.  Just the fact that every culture around the world believes in a higher power, or something beyond this world, even to this day, should say something.</blockquote>
<p>I expected mixed responses to this, as it’s one of my own theories but you didn’t quite get what I was saying. Sure we still use our mouths to eat, thats a given. I’m talking about tools, language, understanding. We eat now with knifes and forks, back then they probably  used their hands or wooden implements. I never mentioned sleep, love or shitting. Pants is perfect though, no we don’t put the on in the same way - they used to wear robes now we have neat efficient pants with zips and buttons. We’ve moved on in every aspect of life by optimising and making things more efficient or useful. Yet religion remains the cause of wars, and hasn’t moved on at all to match science or anything for that matter.</p>
<p>Every culture has a religion because it can be used to control a population. In the times when the people wanted answers and science couldn’t give them a God provided the necessary means to shut the population up while exploiting them through worship so they would abide laws, fight wars and live as they were told to do so.</p>
<blockquote>That statement makes no sense:
"Do you not think it interesting that all children would not know ______ if it weren't for the things the people around them taught them?"
Into the blank insert what you will, math, language, communication, government, morality, about computers, etc etc, the list is endless.  So according to this statement, perhaps none of those exist either?</blockquote>
<p>Preposterous. How do you think maths and language came about? A caveman holds one hand in front of his face and realises he has 5 fingers, put one down he has four. Maths at a basic level is one of the first things am intelligent being comes to understand. Even animals understand basic maths, go and steal a lion cub, and tell me the mother doesn’t notice one of her young is gone. Language is a result of intelligence and evolution, the cavemen that learned to team up killed the cavemen that didn’t. The rest are advances of maths and language, in most parts they’re physically represented - they’re not a concept or an idea like God is. I stand by the point that if a baby had no exposure to religious material it would be atheist.</p>
<blockquote>That simply isn't true either.  Surely there are religions that believe they are the only correct one, but most simply don't agree with that.  For example, some of the major world religions such as christian, muslim, and jewish all believe in the exact same God.  It can be argued that others not directly affiliated with them do too, for example, the religion of many native americans here in the USA believed in a 'Great Spirit', and most of the things they believed about this 'Great Spirit' parallel what christians, muslims, and jews believe about their God.  The little tiny details don't matter.</blockquote>
<p>You must be a very easy going Christian since two of my friends are quite strict Christians and if you claimed their God was the same as the others they’d have a complete duck-fit at you. I’m not arguing for this point though, the use of double quotations in my original post was because it was a quote I found, so I have no need to argue for that.</p>
<blockquote>How is that a contradiction at all?  Obviously we can't even comprehend a being that could be any or all of those things, but that doesn't make it a contradiction or prove it doesn't exist.</blockquote>
<p>I’m a practising IPU believer. If I can’t prove your God doesn’t exist, then you can’t prove the Invisible Pink Unicorn doesn’t exist. If you believe in God then you must at least believe the invisible pink unicorn might exist. If you don’t and you can’t see your hypocrisy, then I don’t have a clue what I could ever say to change that. Both concepts are as ridiculous as the other.</p>
<p>“It is common when discussing the Invisible Pink Unicorn to point out that because she is invisible, no one can prove that she does not exist (or indeed that she is not pink)” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn</a>)</p>
<p>A quote from Bertrand Russell to finish:</p>
<blockquote>And if there were a God, I think it very unlikely that he would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt His existence</blockquote>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I understand what you’re saying but it makes no sense. The bible claims the son of God came to earth and performed miracles. The bible claims a lot of these supernatural things, such as the holy spirit.  These things are recorded in history but there ISN’T any evidence of them having ever existed, or ever happening and funnily enough they’ve never happened again. How can that be? If these things are possible, why did they only happen once? The second coming was supposed to be straight after Jesus died, the jews were all supposed to be taken to the promised Kingdom. It never happened.</p>
<p>Your argument is that I can’t say it doesn’t exist just because there’s no proof. Valid reasoning. At the same time, take your space example. If I said 2000 years ago that people were able to travel into space why would it be impossible now? It shouldn’t be should it? It would be ridiculous for it to be impossible. Yet with miracles and prophets and the accounts of God “talking to people” apparently it’s fine that it doesn’t happen any more. In which case, why has your God turned his back on you?</p>
<p>If they could do it then, then they should be able to do it now. Simple as that. The bible says with faith you can move a mountain. Metaphor or not, people these days obviously don’t have enough faith, otherwise we’d have these miracles. Two thousand years of medicinal advances and we can’t reproduce medicine to instantly heal illnesses like Jesus did with just a touch. My choice of seeing that as impossible is wrong? Of course not. How could it be.</p>
<p>It’s truly outstanding when people will defend faith and belief, two meaningless words. Whilst Logical contradictions are everywhere. The Christian dark ages could only have happened because the Church leaders knew they were wrong. If they had still thought they were right, and had their faith, they wouldn’t have banned non-Christian books burnt people or become such desperate oppressors of an entire continent.</p>
<p>So why is it we cannot continue to perform miracles, we cannot continue to talk to God. You dismiss lack of evidence as no evidence, that’s wrong - lack of evidence is evidence. Evidence that nothing happened. So where did the bible come from? Well there’s evidence that the people existed, but no evidence of god, prophets, or the miracles, the only logical explanation is that those parts were made up. Read “The good man Jesus, and the scoundrel Christ” by Phillip Pullman to see a perfectly valid explanation.</p>

        <p>I enjoy Dawkins, especially the God Delusion.</p>
<p>He has said that and you’re right but you do realise that’s only because we can’t prove there isn’t a creator of the universe. I’m pretty sure Dawkins would say the 's God doesn’t exist. (Although I’m only speculating)</p>
<p>You can’t say God doesn’t exist, since God as a concept isn’t actually ridiculous. A supernatural intelligent creator, that requires us worshipping him is.</p>

<p>In no way has the Bible been used for a controlling manner (not saying people didn’t do bad things using the Bible, but what I am saying is nothing in the Bible teaches wrongness or in-humane thoughts)</p>
<p>Personally, that’s one of the biggest reasons I am a Christian. The way we are supposed to act is just <span class="bbcode-i">right</span> and so perfect. Why would I want to mimic somebody who’s sinned (a scientist) when I can <em>attempt</em> to be like the non-sinful man named Jesus, which I also believe to be the son of God.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Deeper Analysis</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Read this section only if you’re truly an atheist! If you’re one of those <em>maybe God exists</em> who says they’re atheist because of what their “friends” or “peers” think, this may also be for you!</span></p>
<p>As Christians (which in a literal context means “ones like Christ”) we try to be <span class="bbcode-i">like Christ</span> which is also known as <span class="bbcode-i">Christlike</span>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Revelation 3:20</span><br>
“Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in …”</p>
<p>God loves YOU! All you have to do is believe in him and follow his word, nothing more, nothing less!</p>
<p>Often, many people turn away from religious activities and beliefs because of the wrongdoing of another who you once looked up to. You will NEVER find a wrongdoing in Jesus - never EVER EVER! He is the perfect man.</p>
<p>It’s been 3 years since I gave my life to Christ, and I can tell you, the Christian life is not an easy, ‘feel good’ road. It doesn’t come with a benefits package guaranteed to fix all of your problems, at least not this side of heaven. But I wouldn’t trade it now for any other path. The benefits far outweigh the challenges. But, the only real reason to become a Christian, or as some say, to convert to Christianity, is because you believe with all of your heart that God exists, that his Word—the Bible—is true, and that Jesus Christ is who he says he is: “I am the way and the truth and the life.” (John 14:6 NIV)</p>
<p>There is no greater demonstration of devotion, no greater sacrifice of love, than to lay down your life for another. John 10:11 says, “Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.” (NIV) The Christian faith is built upon this kind of love. Jesus gave his life for us: “God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8 NIV).</p>
<p>In Romans 8:35-39 we see that once we’ve experienced Christ’s radical, unconditional love, nothing can separate us from it. And just as we freely receive Christ’s love, as his followers, we learn to love like him and spread this love to others, which is why I’m trying to spread my faith towards you!</p>
