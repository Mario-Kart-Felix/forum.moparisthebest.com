    <title>Disprove God for my girlfriend&#39;s mom</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disprove-god-for-my-girlfriends-mom/380884</link>
    <description>Right off the bat, I&#39;m not religious nor am I toying with the idea of becoming a believer. My girlfriend has an extremely christian mother and forces her to go to church. Her mom has decided that if she can ask her questions about the bible and its inconsistencies and she can&#39;t answer all of them, she will no longer make her go.
Please give me things for her to ask or bring up, and not turn it into a religious debate.</description>

After the collapse of the Roman empire, the Arabs became the centres of learning. They invented algebra, discovered alcohol, figured out the laws of optics and discovered that space is an empty vacuum.<br>
Then the religion of Islam came about and put a stop to all that.<br>
Now, just the University of Harvard outputs more scientific papers than the entire middle-east.</p>

I was singling out Islam simply because it’s my religion and I am most familiar with it. I don’t know how Jews or Christians would think, as in Egypt there are barely any Jews and I haven’t interacted with many Christians during my life.</p>

<p>No I didn’t mean that. Many people were atheists and agnostics (didnt believe in god) but very few were anti-theists (thought society would be better off without religion and try to effect change).</p>

              <p>I remember back in the day when I was the only one who cared about refuting religion. It was around 2007 I think.</p>
<blockquote>Every national church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from God, communicated to certain individuals. The Jews have their Moses; the Christians their Jesus Christ, their apostles and saints; and the Turks their Mohammed, as if the way to God was not open to every man alike.
<p>Each of those churches show certain books, which they call revelation, or the word of God. The Jews say, that their word of God was given by God to Moses, face to face; the Christians say, that their word of God came by divine inspiration: and the Turks say, that their word of God (the Koran) was brought by an angel from Heaven. Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all.</p>
<p>As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the subject, offer some other observations on the word revelation. Revelation, when applied to religion, means something communicated immediately from God to man.</p>
<p>No one will deny or dispute the power of the Almighty to make such a communication, if he pleases. But admitting, for the sake of a case, that something has been revealed to a certain person, and not revealed to any other person, it is revelation to that person only. When he tells it to a second person, a second to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on, it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons. It is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it.</p>
<p>It is a contradiction in terms and ideas, to call anything a revelation that comes to us at second-hand, either verbally or in writing. Revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication — after this, it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him; and though he may find himself obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner; for it was not a revelation made to me, and I have only his word for it that it was made to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it. Below the rim, gourds encircled it – ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea. The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. It was a handbreadth in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.</blockquote>
<p>So… a circular bowl…measuring ten units in diameter… and thirty units in circumference…<br>
We all know that pi is the ratio of the circumference and diameter.<br>
30 = pi * 10<br>
pi = 3</p>
<p>The bible says that pi = 3 !!!<br>
C’mon, even the ancient Egyptians knew pi to more decimal places than that…</p>

              <p>I completely forgot to mention, although there are historical records of Jesus’ existence, the whole bible story revolving around him was mashed together. You see, there were so many healers and prophets walking round them days that they only needed one to create history.</p>
<p>Because Jewish scriptures stated the prophet would be born in the town of Bethlehem and Jesus was from Nazareth they completely made up a Roman census so he’d be born in Bethlehem. You can trawl through all Roman records and there was no census at the time of Jesus’ birth, and never a census that required every man to return to his town of birth (as that would be stupid).</p>
<p>There’s also absolutely no historic records of the Egyptians ever having slaves. So Moses, although him and a bunch of Hebrews might have left Egypt, they were never held their against their will, and they lied about fundamental parts of the story.</p>
<p>When it comes to Jesus’ life, the only historical accounts on most parts are from his followers, and the catholic church has stated all non-canonical scriptures from that time period are unreliable. Probably because they all fail to notice or mention Jesus (because there were so many prophets and messiahs walking round). Take Apollonius of Tyana for example, lived around the time Jesus lived, was a healer and miracle worker, was persecuted and crucified for his religious beliefs. Also raised from the dead. Happened a lot back then, the Church made Jesus’ story special as a power grab.</p>

I don’t see how that is relevant at all… no one here is arguing about that?</p>
<p>[quote=“Bowser jr, post:52, topic:380884”]The Bible states laws about how to treat your slaves, so it clear that God is OK with it.<br>
Leviticus states that gays should be stoned to death, no mention of spiritual death. Yes as I said, this law does not exist anymore as it is fulfilled, but it was there in the beginning and that is my point, it has lots of disgusting thing in it.</p>
<p>As for woman rights, Paul was very negative against women, and he says he speak from God. And the Bible is inspired from God so no errors can get in right?[/quote]I don’t know much about slaves in those days. And I haven’t researched it to come to a conclusion yet.</p>
<p>No one here really knows what happened, or if there are any reports of dead-stoned-gay people in history. But as I’ve said a few times now, we need to interpret the Bible based on present times, and use it to live our life. The Bible is saying: men should love women.</p>
<p>But Bob is correct that a lot of the time the bible talks about death, it means burning in hell.</p>
<p>Can you give an example of what you mean with ‘Paul was very negative against women’? It’s hard to say anything about that if I don’t know what you’re referring to. And yes, there are no ‘errors’ in the Bible. But that doesn’t mean you can take on portion of it and criticize it for what it says.</p>
<p>If I tell you this story:</p>
<blockquote>There once was a man and a woman that had a child. The child grew up and ended up having sex with her dad. This was a very bad thing that should not be done in your life.</blockquote>
You cannot leave out the last sentence and say 'That story had incest in it, it clearly supports incest!'

Well, for starters, it tells me to stone all infidels. It also tells me that it’s better to have my daughter raped than it is to have a guest you don’t know raped.<br>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bowser">@Bowser</a> Jr<br>
Nobody was condemned for slave hold back in those times (∞ B.C - around 1850 AD)! The Bible only states what happens, not only what’s right and you need to understand that.</p>
<p>Just because somebody did something “bad” in the Bible doesn’t mean God is telling you to do those things, and by reading whole books you will better your understanding of the lesson God is trying to teach.</p>
<p>The Bible does not tell to send gays to death, though commission of sexual-immorality (homosexuality, adultery) are sins which can lead to spiritual death!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If you live the life that the Bible tells you to everything will go your way! Every bit of wisdom you can get for this life is in the Bible, whether you believe in God or not! You should study it and learn, even if you don’t believe in God (I pray that you do someday) as it teaches critical morals and ethics.</span></p>
<p>Some of you may have questions as to why God doesn’t allow you to a certain thing, and if you have any just ask me![/quote]<br>
The Bible states laws about how to treat your slaves, so it clear that God is OK with it.<br>
Leviticus states that gays should be stoned to death, no mention of spiritual death. Yes as I said, this law does not exist anymore as it is fulfilled, but it was there in the beginning and that is my point, it has lots of disgusting thing in it.</p>
<p>As for woman rights, Paul was very negative against women, and he says he speak from God. And the Bible is inspired from God so no errors can get in right?</p>

<p>Yes, of course people shouldn’t interpret the bible, even though that’s what you need to do understand it!? Then there’s the fact is was written by people not God (so people have been interpreting it how they like from the beginning). How can you be so naive? You’re a fool.</p>
<p>They entered into a covenant to seek the Lord, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and soul; and everyone who would not seek the Lord, the God of Israel, was to be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. (2 Chronicles 15:12-13 NAB)</p>
<p>A priest’s daughter who loses her honor by committing fornication and thereby dishonors her father also, shall be burned to death. (Leviticus 21:9 NAB)</p>
<p>If a man lies with a male as with a women, both of them shall be put to death for their abominable deed; they have forfeited their lives. (Leviticus 20:13 NAB)</p>
<p>A man or a woman who acts as a medium or fortuneteller shall be put to death by stoning; they have no one but themselves to blame for their death. (Leviticus 20:27 NAB)</p>
<p>If a man commits adultery with another man’s wife, both the man and the woman must be put to death. (Leviticus 20:10 NLT)</p>
<p>So, what’s the non literal interpretation of these? If you are truly Christian why aren’t you walking round lynching all the atheists? You see any Christian will tell you not too take the bible seriously and a lot of it is metaphorical, but blatantly that’s just a modern day rationalization of the ethics your parents taught you contradicting with the ethics and morals taught in the bible. In actual fact back in those savage days 2000 years ago  they did mean this stuff. Embarrassing as it may be to you believers.[/quote]<br>
You are doing it again, you take bits and pieces of the scripture, interpret them literally, and then say ‘The Bible says this! You obviously must do this!’ I explained this to Abraham yesterday; you need to read the entire Bible, and then use it to interpret the different bits and pieces. For the verses you gave, it is saying:<br>
‘if you do this, it is a sin’<br>
Now if you look at the rest of the Bible, it clearly says that sinning results in you not going to heaven. Back in those ‘savage days’, they put sinners to death. Nowadays, we do not.</p>
<p>You can by all means interpret the Bible, but don’t use <span class="bbcode-b">YOUR</span> interpretation, when you have probably never read the entire thing, and don’t understand what it is saying.</p>

<p>So basically, “it doesn’t make sense because it’s not meant to make sense” and “yes it’s evil but a good christian is supposed to ignore that”.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree entirely.[/quote]No you don’t ignore it, you interpret what it <span class="bbcode-b">MEANS</span> by using the rest of the Bible and then apply it to your life. In a lot of the cases the websites give, the verses are saying ‘this is a sin, and if you do it you will be punished’. And the punishment varies depending on what Greeny said: How we live in present time. But the underlying punishment is also that you need to repent.</p>
