    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-own-server-work/18682</link>
    <description>I created the no.ip account.

I called it sheepscape.no-ip.info

and i click it and it made the smily face (without glasses) (i checked the box)

now how the hell do I play moparscape on it? i also downlaoded the project V3 (V4 doesnt work)
and i clicked on compile.bat and it said &quot; &#39;javaac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. Press any key to continue...&quot;
Ahh?
and then i clicked on runserver.bat and it worked now is that right? now what do i do to play on my server? ah help please? i just want to make my sheepscape server using the project v3 to get the hang of things then upload my actual updated stuff later.. how do i make it work, how do i become admin, how do i elect mods, and how do i make it so everyone i tell about it can play on it?

~Help well appreciated,
Cheers. Sheep. ;)</description>
