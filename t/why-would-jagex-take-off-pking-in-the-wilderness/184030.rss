<p>First of all, if you’re gonna waste over $5 on a game that’s not even gonna benefit you then you’re an idiot. If someone would actually pay 1000 dollars for Pixelated Items on a game that can  buy you whatever you want, that’s just, you have to be super retarded to do that. And to pay someone you don’t even know.</p>
<p>Real world Trading for Runescape is stupid in general.</p>

<p>This is becoming progressively more pathetic! RuneScape is made by Jagex. It is their game to do what the hell they want with it. This update made a lot of people quit, but all the new ones joining are leveling it out. There has been practically no increase in players since about summer of last year (based on average.) Now, RuneScape is going to start massively growing again and people will get over it. Get over it now and stop trying to ‘do a good thing’. If you wanted to help people, you wouldn’t be trying to do so in a video game.</p>
