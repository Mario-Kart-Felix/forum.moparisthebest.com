( Notice in 377 there is no item thats made only for construction ), In the 400’s the construction was started and partially made. So dont confuse 377 Custom crap with the real thing…Becuase we can say theres hunter in 377 when there is not, its custom made.[/quote] :0 You are right! BUT if you want con or hunt… Learn how to unpack and repack!!!</p>

              <p>well, although 377 DOES have construction items…it was not when they FULLY released construction in 400-401 somewhere around there and soon after the con. skill was added skill capes were added in 402 or 403…i think.</p>
