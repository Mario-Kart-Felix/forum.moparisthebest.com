    <title>Paying for a pest control script</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-for-a-pest-control-script/7090</link>
    <description>Ok,i think the fastest exp is pest control.If someone can make a script that repeatedly plays,gets the 50 exp,or just attack as much as it sees,and repeat after each game,i will pay up to 4 mil.

i think the best way to do this would be to make it run to the center where the knight is and defend it,thus getting fast exp.

this would be great...but it must ALSO ave antirandoms.lemme know if your up for it.</description>
