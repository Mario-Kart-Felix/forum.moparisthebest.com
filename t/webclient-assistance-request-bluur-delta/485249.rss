    <description>Good old PkPlanet source.

I followed several &quot;tutorials&quot; on how to make a webclient (Ric&#39;s and others), and followed through paying attention etc.  I managed to get my client running, download the cache, but after unpacking... Ugh.
[img]http://gyazo.com/ef7c2142a8be6b856a188426500a1861.png?1360867046[/img]

In response: I did everything over and compared tutorials and all that jazz many, many times.  Which included redoing my cache, moving things around, playing with the Jarmaker/Signer, until it occurred to me I had been at this for five hours, was exhausted, and that something outside of my jarring and cache was wrong.

Today, I made several attempts and got the same results.  I tested the client on another computer as well, with the same outcome (kill me).

What I would conclude is that obviously there is more to doing this, but I have not the slightest idea what.  I&#39;ve seen a lot of sources in the download section carrying slogans such as &quot;webclient ready&quot;, that make it seem just as likely.

I&#39;ve been trying to ditch the dreadful PkPlanet client, but it would not allow me to connect with anything but it&#39;s own client.  However, after reading the dozens of complaints on the thread for the source, the creator claimed that he had a webclient working for it.  I have not seen any stories of success, and did not catch any good advice on that thread.


A bit long winded but I don&#39;t feel like replying for details.
Could anyone give me some hints here? All help is appreciated, thanks.</description>

Quite the needle in a haystack operation…</p>
<p>I deleted the downloaded cache and reloaded the client a few times again, not to any success.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
