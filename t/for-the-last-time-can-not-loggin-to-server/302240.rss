    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/for-the-last-time-can-not-loggin-to-server/302240</link>
    <description>Ok, this is probably the last time i will say this question on this website, butt... My friend has made a server (i did most of the work) and i am the actual owner, but i can&#39;t login. My friend has told me that 200 people went on the server yesterday, and now i wanna join the fun as the owner. I am the owner of the No-Ip adress, i use the client my friend uses, and I am using Windows Vista home preneim 32bit, (i know thats bad). Please help a fellow out guys, if u have a solution, Shoot it at me! and yeas my friend uses a router, and he has port-forwarded, i&#39;ve tried port-forwarding too, but is it nessesary? i will talk when i come back from school.</description>

Only the server owner is the actual owner of the server, because he has all the control of the files &amp; he is hosting the server. Its his choice who is ban, unban, muted, unmuted, mod, admin, co-owner, owner. He does all that so technically no one has “owner” but him lol.</p>
<p>Anyway back on topic…</p>
<p>1.) You should connect to the ip address he gives to you, so you can connect.<br>
2.) I recommend you make your own server lol which is way more rewarding for you.<br>
3.) And finally i recommend you try using the client he gives you that he says connects straight to his ip so you can login.[/quote] I’m finally back from school, now ummm yeah, iv’e made my own server before but recently, i got a router, so now i have no idea on portforwarding and stuff, but i do know how to make a server! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I might use teamviewer on my friends computer to see what he sees and stuffs. and yeass i use the client he uses, and do you mean enter his ip adress in to server ip thing?</p>
