    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-making-my-317-client-server/392285</link>
    <description>Hey guys. I&#39;m trying to make my own rsps like i said in my other thread. But if u guys wanna do team viewer or anything please help me out.
or what&#39;s even better that can you make a video on it? if it takes an hour to make a vid well cut the video in parts.
Upload them on youtube and upload every vid for like 10 minutes.
Thanks!
(teamviewers only on weekends, sorry :(, skype everyday add me -legendrock7 but you have to guide me thru it)
OR CAn you make me one?
It will be wayy easier for me. Can u make me admin too? and make me a webclient?

Thanks!</description>

<p>I would just like to say, get a base, follow a whole bunch of tuts, delete the base, and try to do everythign you did with the tuts again without the tuts. Then you can stop asking around for people to make stuff for you.</p>
