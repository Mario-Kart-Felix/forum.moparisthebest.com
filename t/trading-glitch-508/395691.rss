    <title>Trading Glitch 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trading-glitch-508/395691</link>
    <description>I am using the 508 Mezzy Scape V3.5 source download and trying to make it so that all skills are train-able. But first I wanted to clean up the bugs and some other non-wanted crap.

One of my two biggest issues is the Trading glitch. 

Trading works 100% except for when you are done with the trade, the skills tab, inventory tab, etc. are gone and that part looks the same as it did in the trade. So what Mezzy did was have you bank and then close out of the bank and then it returned to normal. After closing out of the bank, all the tabs came back.

Is there anyone that can help me with this, give me code, or a tutorial on fixing the problem??

If there are any questions please ask. I am quite willing to help you, to help me. lol

Help is very much appreciated.

Please, if you come here to call me a leach then just hit the back button. We are all leachers at some point and after I am done I intend on giving credits and what was originally MezzyScape will look like it was just a good base source.

Thank you in advance!!</description>
