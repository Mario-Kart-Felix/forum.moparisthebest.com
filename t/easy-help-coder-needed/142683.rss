    <description>Hi, i need a script that will allow character to receive a starter pack on the grounds that they haven&#39;t received one before.
I want them to receive full steel and 150k. 

Something like (I&#39;m a ruby coder so I&#39;m not very good with Java);
[code]
Else if (command = (starter))
if &quot;variable that allows you to receive starter&quot; == 0
then send message &quot;You receive your starter pack!&quot;
       add item (whatever they are)
       &quot;variable that allows you to receive starter&quot; = 1
[/code]

I probably got this so wrong as to be unreal, but if anyone can help, post below!</description>
