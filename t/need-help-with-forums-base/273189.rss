 Here is a link to the board most likely to accept your thread on Moparisthebest.com : http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,39.0.html

 * Edit : Once again, and I stress this to Everyone, it is best Not to give your email out to the General public, such as just carelessly placing it within a thread. Try saying ' IM me and I'll give my email. '. For those of you who argue that if multiple people IM you asking for your email and saying that your Inbox is filling up, 2 things; Which is better, having your email being spam ridden or worse by the idiots who have nothing better to do than waste their time on such petty things as using someone else's email address to accept offers for products, etc., or clearing your SMF inbox. Plus, I seriously doubt That many people would IM anyone for small projects.</code></pre>
