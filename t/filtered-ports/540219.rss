    <title>Filtered Ports</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/filtered-ports/540219</link>
    <description>Hey guys. So I portforwarded by 43594 ports and it almost worked. They are portforwarded but they are filtered. That just means when packages are sent to that port, it doesn&#39;t receive them. I turned off my firewall and everything. Does anyone know how I can completely open these ports?</description>
