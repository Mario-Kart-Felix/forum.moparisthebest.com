This is hard to explain so I will include a video to show what exactly I am talking about.
As you see in the video, in PvP for example, if player 1 clicks attack on player 2, player 2 sees the animation/damage/etc a full second b4 player 1. Same thing for non PvP situations. And not so much just player 2, but every1 sees the action b4 player 1 does, so the person performing the action has a little lag but no one else..
Does anyone have ANY ideas on how to fix this? ALL HELP IS GREATLY APPRECIATED

              <p>well thats true, sometimes its the clients. if they’re both different client versions or different clients alltogether, one could be coded slimmer and better than the other, or have different gfx or models. so these could all be results effecting one another players. if you wanna teamview with me for further troubleshooting and show me or whatever. u can msn me @ <a href="mailto:Shana3422@hotmail.com">Shana3422@hotmail.com</a></p>

              <p>this more or less can be either your computer or your internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes a computer(a little before 2009 computers) have generation 2-4 cores with intel and gfx cards from amd or some other company, maybe nvidia. Which you’d think that although you have a slightly older core of gfx card, it shouldn’t really matter at all, but drivers rarely get updated for these older hardwares. so updated and more i guess futuristic coding and what not will be more complex, causing the hardware to process things slower.</p>
<p>If you think thats not the problem, or ur pc is godlike.</p>
<p>then maybe its your internet.</p>
<p>is someone else using your internet at the same time?</p>
<p>if your mom is on skype and your on an rsps, this could be the problem.</p>
<p>If this is the problem, some not new or new routers are 1 channel routers. Meaning that anything and everything processed with the router(your ethernet connection, wifi devices, netflix, etc.) will all be on that one channel, causing massive bandwidth suckage.</p>
<p>Where a 2 channel router holds wifi devices seperately, meaning your mom can watch netflix with the blu-ray player while your playing rsps with your ethernet corded pc.</p>
<p>So it can also depend on your router.</p>
<p>Additional problems - are you torrenting atm? that causes massive bandwidth suckage.<br>
maybe your internet speeds just suck?? 3mbps usually is the standard average for americans if you are one. So try getting more speed or upgrading internet.</p>
<p>-internal but rare- sometimes internet speeds can sometimes start slowing because of coaxial cables being worn or damaged. so if none of the above are a problem. try contacting your ISP(internet service provider for help).</p>
<p>-last resort- are you time warner cable internet? time warner cable is a shared internet connection, meaning everyone in your neighboorhood, or those at least with time warner cable using internet, connect to one box somewhere nearby, which goes to the main time warner cable hub. that box might have like 100mbps maximum. if 50 nearby people using that box are online using internet, it can cause drag.</p>
<p>Networks like verizon and comcast i believe are privately wired, meaning you go direct to the processing hub. That’s why they cost more.</p>
<p>Hope this helps m8.</p>
