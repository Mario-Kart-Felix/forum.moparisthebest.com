    <title>Be more careful with your servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/be-more-careful-with-your-servers/415460</link>
    <description>Many members of this community, specifically the members who work with a team are getting screwed by others. The main reason is from bringing people who don&#39;t know what they are doing into their team. Once you are guilty of this you have the issue of not getting things done right and also frustation; which then leads to a leaked source.

To combat the leaking problem you can simply [u]test[/u] people who want to be apart of your team. By test I mean ask them how they would do &#39;this or that&#39;. If they are unsure of how to complete the simple test or don&#39;t produce satisfactory results don&#39;t let them join your team. It&#39;s really as simple as that, if you take the time to choose the correct members you will not only prevent a leak but you will succeed with your goals.

The next issue I see a lot of is a source being deleted by that [i]one[/i] team member who just decides to be an ass. Once this happens you are, to be blunt: shit out of luck. Below is a list of repository products that give each member of the team a local copy of the files, so if someone deletes the files you won&#39;t see the effect unless you pull that change. Incase you do pull though these products will allow you to revert back to any state of the server you wish. Each &#39;state&#39; is called a revision and at any point you can revert back to any revision you wish. All of that is as simple as a click of the mouse.

[u]Repositories[/u]

Repositories have been a real popular tool for developers for years now. They constantly grow as more and more people are using them and developing new ones. 

Here is a list of the popular ones:


[ul][li][url=http://subversion.tigris.org/]SVN[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://mercurial.selenic.com/]Mercurial[/url][/li]
[li][url=http://git-scm.com/]Git[/url][/li][/ul]


Now each of these have a download you can use and work with through your filesystem. These are simple to use, just make a folder and you can add a repository there, commit, push and pull right from the right-click menu.

The other awesome thing about all of those is they each have an Eclipse plugin (not sure about other IDEs but I am sure they do). These help out with programming projects, such as Runescape private servers as well as anything else. You can commit, push and pull directly from Eclipse and not even leave the IDE to scramble through folders to do the same tasks.

So hopefully you read all of that and learned a little bit. I hate seeing people lose their work for whatever reason, even if it wasn&#39;t good in the first place. It&#39;s simple to prevent this and all you need to do is read everything above to educate yourself enough to prevent this from happening to you.

Thanks for reading.</description>

</aside>
<p>That is a good point there. Well maybe this can also HELP (not solve) that issue. If some people use repositories than maybe they will feel motivated to work because they will be ashamed to quit and now they can’t lie about it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Alright in the near future I will write up some more on the actual repository part. (At the end though, so there will be an explanation then the tutorial bit kind of).</p>

<p>OT: Nice. I am currently not going to use this method, but looks useful for a future development I might do. Dropbox is working fine for me.</p>

              <p>Yes, now this thread has been restored, I can post a little feedback about the thread:</p>
<p>I see a lot of people that do stuff like this, I use to comment about the little things like that but got tired of doing it because people would continue, and continue, and continue… to do that. So I gave up and would see them be screwed over after about a month that each development would do this. It’s the most stupidest thing I’ve seen in a while from the new users (sometimes the old ones too), and I just don’t understand the reason for it because it’s obvious that it would happen.</p>
<p>Thanks for the post, but it’s a fat chance that people would even bother to read this (the new ones the most).</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Many members of this community, specifically the members who work with a team are getting screwed by others. The main reason is from bringing people who don’t know what they are doing into their team. Once you are guilty of this you have the issue of not getting things done right and also frustation; which then leads to a leaked source.</p>
<p>To combat the leaking problem you can simply <span class="bbcode-u">test</span> people who want to be apart of your team. By test I mean ask them how they would do ‘this or that’. If they are unsure of how to complete the simple test or don’t produce satisfactory results don’t let them join your team. It’s really as simple as that, if you take the time to choose the correct members you will not only prevent a leak but you will succeed with your goals.</p>
<p>The next issue I see a lot of is a source being deleted by that <span class="bbcode-i">one</span> team member who just decides to be an ass. Once this happens you are, to be blunt: shit out of luck. Below is a list of repository products that give each member of the team a local copy of the files, so if someone deletes the files you won’t see the effect unless you pull that change. Incase you do pull though these products will allow you to revert back to any state of the server you wish. Each ‘state’ is called a revision and at any point you can revert back to any revision you wish. All of that is as simple as a click of the mouse.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Repositories</span></p>
<p>Repositories have been a real popular tool for developers for years now. They constantly grow as more and more people are using them and developing new ones.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the popular ones:</p>
<p>[ul][li]<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">SVN</a>[/li]<br>
[li]<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Mercurial</a>[/li]<br>
[li]<a href="http://git-scm.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Git</a>[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Now each of these have a download you can use and work with through your filesystem. These are simple to use, just make a folder and you can add a repository there, commit, push and pull right from the right-click menu.</p>
<p>The other awesome thing about all of those is they each have an Eclipse plugin (not sure about other IDEs but I am sure they do). These help out with programming projects, such as Runescape private servers as well as anything else. You can commit, push and pull directly from Eclipse and not even leave the IDE to scramble through folders to do the same tasks.</p>
<p>So hopefully you read all of that and learned a little bit. I hate seeing people lose their work for whatever reason, even if it wasn’t good in the first place. It’s simple to prevent this and all you need to do is read everything above to educate yourself enough to prevent this from happening to you.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
