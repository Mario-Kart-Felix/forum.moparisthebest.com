    <description>Mopar Users,

                     We have had a very successful week here, and are striving for excellence. Lagex is looking for a excellent Java Coder, who will partake in the development of Agility on our server. This will bring more popularity to the server. If you can Java Code, and do it well, please PM or reply to this post.

Thanks,

            Mod Joe (Lagex Staff)</description>
