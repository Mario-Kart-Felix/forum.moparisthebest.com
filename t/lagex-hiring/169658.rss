    <description>We&#39;re hiring 1-2 very talented coders, to help take part in a massive project. We&#39;re currently creating the &quot;Lava Cave&quot; and our team is busy with Abuse Reports, minor updates, and some glitches. We need someone, just to add a few NPCs and make some global objects work. Nothing too hard, but we don&#39;t have time. We need some coders that can get it done the first or second time, without questions asked. (More explained if hired.)

If you feel interested, reply to this post, or PM me.

            ~Lagex Staff.
