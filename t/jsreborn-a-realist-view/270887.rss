    <description>[B]Please if you read this leave me a message, and use our support signature if you like this.[/B]

[b][size=14pt]This server has no famous names involved, no big time programmers, this is a server made by the people, for the people, and will always stay that way.[/SIZE][/b]

[b][size=14pt]I notice alot of people on Mopar think everything is based of DeltaScape, be assured if you watch the videos, or know anything and read my post this is a server created 100% by me from Defqon&#39;s Hyperion Core, with RS Protocol implemented by me.[/SIZE][/b]

[CENTER][U][size=20pt]JSReborn[/SIZE][/U]

[size=20pt][color=Navy]History.[/COLOR][/SIZE]
JSReborn is the sequel and final installment to the string of servers known as JSRevolution.
Otherwise known as JSR. The previous JSRevolution servers where all popular in their own context and for their own individual features and the ways they accomodated players. Known mainly for the extreme amount of players, and the combat and PvP features, Along with an Economy not found in many servers. After many Drama filled events, I have learned a lot in my Server owning experience, and i decided to take that and run, and leave servers with the fact i grew as a person and learnt alot. But now i am back, with the soul goal to achieve what in my eyes has never been done.


[size=20pt][color=Navy]My View[/COLOR][/SIZE]
Now a factor in what i believe will make this server, is my views and decisions as The Owner. Now i have read through quite a lot of Development threads and i see all of them going on about how a server like theirs has never been seen, how they can live up and compete with BattleScape, and become the largest server these communites has ever seen. Well im going to say right now i cannot promise that, i may be judged on that opinion i may even be ridiculed, but right now i can say i am most certainly not the best programmer in this community, nor have hope to be, but i do know how to make do with what i have got, and i can actually promise a server out of this and as long as i achieve my goals i am happy with that!


[size=20pt][color=Navy]My Goals[/COLOR][/SIZE]

Somebody once told me that without Goals how do you know what to Strive for. So these are My Goals that i WILL achieve in the creation of this server.

[color=blue][size=20pt]# Create A Stable Server[/SIZE][/COLOR]
This means to create a server that wont disconnect every Hour on an Auto Restarter. and Wont go down randomly for hours at a time. A server that Says &quot;24/7&quot; because it actually means it.

[color=blue][size=20pt]# To Create A Free Game For All[/SIZE][/COLOR]
No matter how big this game gets, or how popular it may grow, i will assure you all that JSReborn will always be a Fully free to play game, i am not in this for profit, i am in this to finally create a server real people want and real people want to play, and a price should not be put on that.

[color=blue][size=20pt]# To Make A Game With Meaning[/SIZE][/COLOR]
This is an important one to me, as this means different things to different people, alot of people have different views on what the &quot;Perfect&quot; server is, which is why im not going to go make a server with all the features RuneScape has, Because if i do that, im competing with RuneScape itself, and whos gonna come out better off, a 15 year old kid, or a multi-million $ corporation. Thats what i thought. So i will strive to find that balance, so it doesnt take years to create a good account, or months of repetitive clicking for a decent Item, i will find the balance to make the game Challenging yet progressive, Quick, but with a sense of accomplishment, that thrill when you get a good drop when pking, but that adreniline when walking into the mage bank with good items on. That is what i strive for.

[color=blue][size=20pt]# High Quality Game play[/SIZE][/COLOR]
This is another one, I HATE and i mean HATE seeing a server advertised with Teleports in the emote tabs, or ::help commands or even help guides in the Quest Tab. Servers with no creativity. 
I always strive to create High Quality Game Play and wouldnt release a server without it, im not going to rename a prayer, or a weapon or npc, make things look cheap by re coloring Items, I will have a Real new prayer, never seen before, a Sprite i made myself from nothing, or a Newly designed weapon (probably with the help of Galkon =]) that has never been seen before with its own special and ability, None of this may be special, but it is just another thing i strive to do, is not always focus on the big features, but make the little things nice as it holds a server together.

[color=blue][size=20pt]# A Server Like No Other &lt; ---- Read this[/SIZE][/COLOR]
Now when this is said, people assume that they mean &quot;The best server ever seen&quot; no. thats now what i mean, this server is simply a type of server never been made in my opinion, but one that is always looked for. it is a [b]High Quality Pk Server[/b]. Just like pures on RuneScape, main type of Pures, Strength pure, Range Pure, Barrows Pure, Zerker Pure, Main types of servers, Adventure Servers, Pk Servers, Now generally Adventure servers are very high quality, with alot of realistic features, and generally, Pk Servers are fast, buggy, glitched up and arn&#39;t stable, the opposite of the Adventure Server, now i hope this server will be the middle. a Pk Server, but that isn&#39;t terribly low quality, with realistic features, stability, isn&#39;t instant levels. The perfect middle, between the two major types. That satisfy all needs.

[size=20pt][color=Navy]My Server[/COLOR][/SIZE]
Now you have seen what this server was about and what i am striving for now i will tell you about it and its features and how everything is going to work.

[color=Navy][size=20pt]Basic Features &amp; Base[/SIZE][/COLOR]
Now as previous players know i have used a variety of bases for my servers over time, from ZDR to DeltaScape, To My own scratch bases.
The base of this server is as nothing i have seen as of yet, the closest thing being Emulous.
The server is 100% made from a Blank Document. anybody who claims anything else is Stupid and or Jealous.
[B]The Below is for those who know what Java is, and understand it.[/B]
The server is a fully packaged, and interfaced server, with a complete new concept of player threading and Data Structuring, I wont tell you exactly what i have done but i can say i have Replaced the Array System with another non volatile substitute.
[B]For those who want to Play this server not critisize it keep reading from here[/B]

[size=20pt][color=Navy]Duel Arena[/COLOR][/SIZE]

Im [b]VERY[/b] proud of this achievement, as of 12:16am. 28 March, 2009. I can officialy state i have the PERFECT duel arena that RuneScape had in their 317 deob versions.
explain more in morning...tired..

[size=20pt][color=Navy]Non-Combat Skills[/COLOR][/SIZE]

The percentages are compared to RuneScape skill standards, So 100% means 100% like RuneScape 317, If you see a 90% (Finished) Like Rune-Crafting, it means its finished, but its not 100% like RuneScape for example, my runecrafting you get teleported to the abyss and find your way to the center, but instead of it teleporting you to a altar the rifts make runes.

RuneCrafting - 90% - ([COLOR=&quot;Green&quot;]Finished[/COLOR])
Agility - 60% - (Un-Finished)
Herblore - 70% - (Un-Finished)
Thieving - 40% - (Un-Finished)
Crafting - 85% - (Un-Finished)
Fletching - 65% - (Un-Finished)
Slayer - 90% - (Un-Finished)
Mining - 100% - ([COLOR=&quot;Green&quot;]Finished[/COLOR])
Smithing - 100% - ([COLOR=&quot;Green&quot;]Finished[/COLOR])
Fishing - 73% - (Un-Finished)
Cooking - 100% - ([COLOR=&quot;Green&quot;]Finished[/COLOR])
Firemaking - 85% - (Un-Finished) - Video: [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGlPMvuzYAY]YouTube - Firemaking[/url]
Woodcutting - 95% - ([COLOR=&quot;Green&quot;]Finished[/COLOR]) --- Working On Video
Farming - 0% - (Not Applicable / Later Update)


[size=20pt][color=Navy]Economy[/COLOR][/SIZE]

Economy. What can i say, this is a KEY factor in ALL good servers, now what do we need to create a good Economy, We need Skills, we need drops, we need items, supply and demand, wants and needs, time and skills, income, means, producers, supplies, consumers, these are all the things a good Economy needs, and i will provide a base for all these to work, letting a skiller make better cash then a middle class pker, with hardly any skill, but a highly skilled pker earn just as much as a highly determined skiller. But theres one thing that ruins all servers Economy attempts, and that is duping, which my server CANNOT have, and i will explain how i will acheive this.

[size=20pt][color=Navy]Duping.[/COLOR][/SIZE]

For those who dont know duping is when a player duplicates item through a method to mass produce items and throw away a servers Economy,

[B]What causes Duping?[/B]
LAZY PROGRAMMING

[B]Explain?[/B]
Main ways to exploit a &#39;Dupe&#39; : Trade, Bank, Stake, Drop.

These are the 4 things almost all dupes are deprived from, and why? Because they are all poorly programmed, in every server base i have seen ALL of the above are merely Guidelines, waiting for a player to push the guidelines and find an exploit, All My Trading, Banking, Staking, and Dropping systems are not just Guidelines, waiting for a player the experiment with them and try push the limits, they work one way, and one way only, and that one way does the job they are designed to do and do it right. no more &quot;Accept - Fast Decline&quot; Decline as fast as you want, you decline the trade is off. No more getting out of the interface, is your out, so is your partner.

<p>Nothing special? Its a hyperion core. capable of holding over 2000 threads without any evidence of thread corruption, no more wL crap.</p>
<p>Just because i just created an account don’t assume i just downloaded some server took some pics and posted.</p>
<p>Not trying to be rude, it just annoys me the amount of work is actually put into this and people just say “Its ‘ok’” when they don’t really read the thread.</p>
