    <title>All-new 562 release</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/all-new-562-release/403064</link>
    <description>Look, I&#39;ve seen in 95% of the topics I&#39;ve replied in and looked at, someone just HAS to say &quot;LEECH&quot; or &quot;This is a freaken leech&quot; and etc.

Guy&#39;s if your releasing your rsps then have in mind that someone might leech it, so stop spazing over a freaken leech.
Almost every rsps is leeched to another in some way. They all were created on the exact same base, and then people decided to code it and change it all.
317s: 
About 80% of the 317s I see use DSPK. (I&#39;m still thinking why?)
About 20% now use Delta or PI and add like 20million customs to them.
377s:
I literally see none of these anymore I really don&#39;t know why.
474s:
Oh lord, I see more customs in 100% of these then I see in 317s.
562s: (I&#39;m not bothering with 508s and 525s because most of them are different from another)
I&#39;ll just start that some people use elemental X as a base, but thats a leech of gaazaascape, but I&#39;m sure that that&#39;s a leech of painzone, and painzone might be a leech of another thing.
600+:
All I really see if revengescape as a 600+ to be worthy of my time. For those that download revengescape, please note that this thing is 407 megabites.

Guys do a lot of people a favor and stop being an ass about leeches. This is starting to be immature.
Leechers: Learn to fucking code or you&#39;ll get spammed by people saying &quot;leeched&quot;. 
========================================================================================
I might release my server armscape, the ex owner literally gave it to me after he got pissed off at me for fixing his damn shops.</description>

<p>Wow so you took your precious time writing this all up? Dude really if you see why people say shit is leeched &amp; that its not there work you would understand the positives about it. Now lets see.</p>
<ol>
<li>People take time to change homes add a couple shops, new npcs, &amp; make up a new name.</li>
</ol>
<p>Changing home &amp; adding things &amp; re naming the server then hosting it with the same pictures is leeching, people think C&amp;P is fine but if you really want to make it in rsps please fucking learn the knowledge of java programming, It makes a hole difference if you know java even basic java &amp; basic java is not changing home &amp; adding a few things.</p>
<p>Half the people around rsps community’s do make a big deal about leeching, Which in case is because its mainly someone they know &amp; how much work they put in to it. People don’t want to see the same shit over &amp; over, Your sarcasm you put down just now makes you look like a big joke next time you configure on posting a topic about leeching make sure you know what it is first okay.</p>
<p>&amp; yes you do piss me off reason is, You people cant do worthless shit without leeching because your to lazy to learn instead you would rather take part of someones work &amp; call it yours dude fuck off Moparscape &amp; learn some since on why you post stupid ass shit thats not even meant to be posted.</p>
<p>Rage/flam/cuss me out all you want I wont be here to reply no more so waste your time I hope I made my self clear &amp; please anyone just anyone correct me if I am wrong. :] have a good day.[/quote]</p>
<p>You don’t get it don’t you? If people release their rsps, then and they don’t expect it to be leeched, I really hope they get their head checked.</p>

              <p>Look, I’ve seen in 95% of the topics I’ve replied in and looked at, someone just HAS to say “LEECH” or “This is a freaken leech” and etc.</p>
<p>Guy’s if your releasing your rsps then have in mind that someone might leech it, so stop spazing over a freaken leech.<br>
Almost every rsps is leeched to another in some way. They all were created on the exact same base, and then people decided to code it and change it all.<br>
317s:<br>
About 80% of the 317s I see use DSPK. (I’m still thinking why?)<br>
About 20% now use Delta or PI and add like 20million customs to them.<br>
377s:<br>
I literally see none of these anymore I really don’t know why.<br>
474s:<br>
Oh lord, I see more customs in 100% of these then I see in 317s.<br>
562s: (I’m not bothering with 508s and 525s because most of them are different from another)<br>
I’ll just start that some people use elemental X as a base, but thats a leech of gaazaascape, but I’m sure that that’s a leech of painzone, and painzone might be a leech of another thing.<br>
600+:<br>
All I really see if revengescape as a 600+ to be worthy of my time. For those that download revengescape, please note that this thing is 407 megabites.</p>
<h1>Guys do a lot of people a favor and stop being an ass about leeches. This is starting to be immature.<br>
Leechers: Learn to fucking code or you’ll get spammed by people saying “leeched”.</h1>
<p>I might release my server armscape, the ex owner literally gave it to me after he got pissed off at me for fixing his damn shops.</p>
