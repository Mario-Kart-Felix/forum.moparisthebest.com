InfernoScape is a server that is designed for the player. Inferno Scape is an economy server, with loads of features including skills, bosses and minigames. You can do whatever pleases you on Inferno Scape, such as go questing, PvP with some of your friends, or maybe just hang and chat! The server is economized strategically so that no item that can be obtained by a boss or minigame, is in a shop. Another great concept is our PvP system. We have designed it so that when you kill someone, you get a random number out of 5, PvP Points. This provides the thrill we all loved when we k03d that special someone in the wilderness. We hope you enjoy your stay at Inferno Scape! What are you waiting for? Play Now!
