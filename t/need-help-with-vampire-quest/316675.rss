    <title>Need help with vampire quest!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-vampire-quest/316675</link>
    <description>alot of quests on delta scape are really hard to understand, ive been adding text to them to help people understand, but i got stuck on a quest myself.

i think that a player must somehow get a brass key(983) then open a chest in this room:[img]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=413237.0;attach=17285[/img]
to get garlic and 83 coins.

i dont understand where players are supposed to get the brass key</description>
