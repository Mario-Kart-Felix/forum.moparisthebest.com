    <description>Ok, so you add a model to the client, then change the ints in the class8 file. You have a server that runs. You have a client that runs. I personally have the v20 deltascape client. What I THINK I am supposed to do is run the server, then run the client; however, when I do that I get the whole &quot;Error connecting to server&quot; crap. So, can someone tell me what I am really supposed to do? I will list what I am doing below

1. downloaded the deltascape source
2. downloaded the deltascape v20 official client
3. executed the SOURCE&#39;s run.bat, and it said &quot;Deltascape server&quot;, which means it is running
4. executed the CLIENT&#39;S run.bat, and it opened a window that contained the client for deltascape. 
5. tryed logging in with an account but it said error connecting to server...
6. asked question on the forums...
7. hoping someone helps me.
