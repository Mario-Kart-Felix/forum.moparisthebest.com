    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-does-this-keep-showing-up/219866</link>
    <description>ok i tried to change my server so that when some1 strted they started as a noob but they had rares... i tried to change the defaults so that all skills were lvl 1 with 1 exp and the player inv has a phat set, h&#39;ween set, santa, 2 easters, pumpkins, and a scythe (just cause they&#39;re cool and i was gone for rs giving us scythes)....

and this isnt the first time if edited the default chars... before this my newbies all started with full mystic (dark -hat) and a red p hat...

the box under the screen keeps saying:
