    <description>Hi guys, i have been working on making a webclient and i followed this tutorial: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=336494.0

First time i tryed to add everything etc it didnt work so i deleted it all and tryed one more time. Still wont work. I get and error after downloaded the cache files &quot;Client updated - Reload your client&quot;. Nothing happends if you reload the client. You still get the same error.

You can try yourself: http://unoscape.clanservers.com/
