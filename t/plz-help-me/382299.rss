    <description>Heyy mopar, me again with another problem LOL. Yeah so i&#39;ve been trying for like 2mnths to make a webclient. I just tried again and I done it. I jar and signed, made auto-cache downloader, all that. But one small problem, when i upload this html code to my website it comes up with error click for details...

&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
&lt;TITLE&gt;Your Webclient&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;PRAGMA&quot; CONTENT=&quot;NO-CACHE&quot;&gt;
&lt;/HEAD&gt;

&lt;BODY&gt;

&lt;applet name=&quot;bladeblitz&quot; width=&quot;765&quot; height=&quot;503&quot; archive=&quot;client.jar&quot; code=&quot;client.class&quot;&gt;
&lt;param name=&quot;java_arguments&quot; value=&quot;-Xmx1024m&quot;&gt;
&lt;/applet&gt;

&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;

But when I run it from my computer with the client.jar it works. I think what it is is that it needs the client.jar and the html code on the site to run. That right? Well I tried that and nothing. Please help me!!!!

Thanks :)
