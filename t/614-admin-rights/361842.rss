    <description>====READ THIS FIRST====
I have to use a 602+ because i made a cache extractor that takes &quot;animation files&quot; instead of &quot;models&quot;. I am trying to find the gfx, gfx2, and anim IDs of most of the dungeoneering NPC&#39;s and 562 NPC&#39;s (like corp beats etc.)so i can put fully animated 602 NPC&#39;s on a 317, 508, etc. without having to dump animation info


dont tell me to move down to a 562 or 525. Or your a fucking idiot because as far is a remember, dung NPC&#39;s came out in the 601+ protocol.

This soruce is the ONLY 602+  source that works on my computer, dont tell me to get a different source.

Well, i go in the character saves and try to change the rights, but when i find &quot;rights&quot; it has some kind of box gibberish... i tried adding a 2 behind it, which only nulls my account. its a .SER file.

anyone might know what i do.

NOTE: yes i know, im a terrible 602+ programmer, i just need to find alot of ID&#39;s that only the 602+ protocols have</description>
