    <title>Java Tutorials: Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-tutorials-question/208015</link>
    <description>Em, sorry to bother you guys, but I&#39;d just like to ask a simple question.  I&#39;ve been reading and revising the Java tutorials recently (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/) and I got a little confused.

Basically, I&#39;m wondering if I should have any programming experience at all before reading these?  They keep referring to Java&#39;s syntax and how I, the reader, [i][b]may[/b][/i] not recognise it.  Uh, ofcourse I don&#39;t, I&#39;m reading tutorials for beginners!  Does this mean that I should have a faint idea of basic syntaxes/know other languages (Even barely)?  Are there other tutorials I should read before these?

The tutorials show Java code now and then, and explain how the code would make X happen, and I understand how the code would make it happen, but should I also be taking note of the actual code, and should I have a vague idea of how to write it already?

Cheers.</description>

              <p>I personally think tutorials don’t do much, you won’t learn unless you start doing things for yourself, and no, you don’t need programming experience, the “may” can go both ways.</p>
<p>I really do think that in languages such as Java, your better off learning by trial and error.</p>
