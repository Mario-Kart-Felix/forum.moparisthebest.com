    <description>Hi guys and welcome to my lottery simulator game :) i am making this for learning and experience only, if you don&#39;t like it, then dont comment. Lets get to it:

[B][I]What is the lottery game?[/I][/B]
The lottery game is a fun little game where you need to get money to bet on the lottery, To gain money you can get a job. There are a ton of jobs each paying at different rates per minute. You can also go to university and college to gain &#39;Education points&#39; which help you get a better job. Better job = More money. The lottery isnt exactly 100%, you can win something by just getting the lucky ball, anyway. Please enjoy the media, i will start a new log from this point onwards, this game is pretty basic.
