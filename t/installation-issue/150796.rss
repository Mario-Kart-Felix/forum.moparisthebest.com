    <title>Installation Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/installation-issue/150796</link>
    <description>Mmk, let me begin with me installing Vista. I installed Vista back 5 months ago I&#39;d say, and I decided to remove it, so I did, and I put Windows XP SP1 which I can&#39;t install drivers on, because I don&#39;t have the right CD, anyways, I decided to get Media Center Edition, because I thought it might have pre-installed drivers, but it did not, and I was without internet. 

So I went to install Ubuntu 7.04, and it didn&#39;t work, so I tried Kubuntu 7.04, and it did not work either. So I downloaded Ubuntu and Kubuntu 7.10, and they both still did not work, and when I say do not work I boot into the install CD and when I go to Run or install K/Ubuntu it only begins to install, and then it stops. On 7.04 with the non-graphical boot screen, it does this massive list of errors, which I can&#39;t tell you them, because they&#39;re going to fast. 

But when I do the 7.10 Graphical Boot Screen, the status bar goes back and fourth and then stops at the left side, and does not move. Now, I downloaded Mandriva, deciding it might be an issue with the new updates, or something, but that does not work either. I will also tell you that I did successfully install Ubuntu about 6 or 7 months ago. Then made the switch to Vista. I also must tell you I tried to install Solaris, but I had semi-messed up in a sense that I had successfully installed it but removed the disc to soon, so I installed Windows XP to try and format the drive. That may have caused the issue, I am not certain. I have no idea what to do at this point, it is an issue with the Ethernet Driver that is why I decided to install Linux, but after finding out I cannot use Linux anymore, I have found a bigger issue. I have a Dell Dimension 2350. 


I was experiencing DVD reading/burning issues when using Vista before I decided to quit using it. I have a two tray CD/DVD Burner, and the Top tray, the DVD tray was not reading or writing. I have tried both trays and they still do not correctly read the Linux CD, however they did successfully install Windows Xp.

I am very grateful to any help you all can offer me.

              <p>I’ve tried that, only one of the CD’s had an error and it was one of the CD’s from Kubuntu, they had shipped it to me. The rest never had any errors. The root of the problem was I had removed Vista because the 1st disc tray couldn’t read DVD’s or burn them, like it was suposed to. After I installed Xp (which I used the 1st disc tray to install) they worked, but I couldn’t get the drivers. So I decided to put Kubunut back on. And it read the CD and went to the Boot menu, and I chose “Run and install” blahblahblah, It began to boot, but then stopped after 5 or 6 seconds.</p>

<p>Sorry, I’m not at home at the moment, I would’ve posted the specs, and more detail about everything. It is Ethernet. Though I did know Kubuntu and Ubuntu were the same, e.g. Feisty Fawn, Dorothy Dollis. I didn’t really think about them both having the same drivers, I really was thinking about how Ubuntu was successful in booting the live CD, but Kubuntu never was, that was the root of the issue. I do have the Driver CD’s for WIndows XP SP1, though the install CD doesn’t recognize the hardware. I assumed Media Center had pre-existing drivers in the OS.</p>

              <p>I’m not ignorant. I know how long they should run. I ordered 3 Ubuntu CD’s and I ran them all, I ordered 3 Kubuntu CD’s and ran them all. I burned a Kubuntu 7.10 disc, and an Ubuntu 7.10 disk, I even burned a Mandriva Linux disk. None of them work. I ran them all night and they stayed at the same point the entire time, it doesn’t even boot into the Live part. I’ve run and installed them before, and they take less than a minute, it’s something Vista has done I’m sure, and I can’t figure it out.</p>

              <p>Mmk, let me begin with me installing Vista. I installed Vista back 5 months ago I’d say, and I decided to remove it, so I did, and I put Windows XP SP1 which I can’t install drivers on, because I don’t have the right CD, anyways, I decided to get Media Center Edition, because I thought it might have pre-installed drivers, but it did not, and I was without internet.</p>
<p>So I went to install Ubuntu 7.04, and it didn’t work, so I tried Kubuntu 7.04, and it did not work either. So I downloaded Ubuntu and Kubuntu 7.10, and they both still did not work, and when I say do not work I boot into the install CD and when I go to Run or install K/Ubuntu it only begins to install, and then it stops. On 7.04 with the non-graphical boot screen, it does this massive list of errors, which I can’t tell you them, because they’re going to fast.</p>
<p>But when I do the 7.10 Graphical Boot Screen, the status bar goes back and fourth and then stops at the left side, and does not move. Now, I downloaded Mandriva, deciding it might be an issue with the new updates, or something, but that does not work either. I will also tell you that I did successfully install Ubuntu about 6 or 7 months ago. Then made the switch to Vista. I also must tell you I tried to install Solaris, but I had semi-messed up in a sense that I had successfully installed it but removed the disc to soon, so I installed Windows XP to try and format the drive. That may have caused the issue, I am not certain. I have no idea what to do at this point, it is an issue with the Ethernet Driver that is why I decided to install Linux, but after finding out I cannot use Linux anymore, I have found a bigger issue. I have a Dell Dimension 2350.</p>
<p>I was experiencing DVD reading/burning issues when using Vista before I decided to quit using it. I have a two tray CD/DVD Burner, and the Top tray, the DVD tray was not reading or writing. I have tried both trays and they still do not correctly read the Linux CD, however they did successfully install Windows Xp.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to any help you all can offer me.</p>
