<p>Long answer:<br>
For a bot to be undetectable, you need to think about two factors.</p>
<p>If your bot is programmed correctly, and there are perhaps hundreds of factors to consider, then when you run it, jagex (runescape) should not be able to tell the difference between you running your bot and someone loading the client up in their favorite web browser (requesting all the right files at the right time from the webserver, supplying all the exact correct parameters to the applet, the events you generate must be identical to real events an actual mouse or keyboard would generate).  As far as I know, there is no current public bot that does this.  But it is possible to do with some research. (someone will say they don’t pay attention to little things like web server logs etc etc, but that is not the point, they could if they wanted to, so that makes it detectable)</p>
<p>The other factor is your scripts that you run.  Even if your bot is not detectable, a crappy script (one that moves your mouse in a straight line or clicks on the exact same pixel repeatedly) will get you banned just as easily.  As opposed to making an undetectable bot, this problem is quite a bit hairier as there is no perfect solution, it boils down to a problem of AI.  There are algorithms you can use to help make it less detectable, but in the end, without knowing exactly what and how runescape analyses on the server side, there is no way we can say a script is 100% undetectable.</p>

<p>Hell yeah it did! U rock!!!</p>

              <p>I’m sure everyone has different thoughts towards this, but I think as long as you limit the autoing to less than like 4 hours a day, train multiple skills, don’t let it get stuck in random events, and use good scripts with antiban/randomness implemented, you’ll never get banned.</p>
