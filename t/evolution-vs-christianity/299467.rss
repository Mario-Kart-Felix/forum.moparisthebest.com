    <title>Evolution vs Christianity</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/evolution-vs-christianity/299467</link>
    <description>I already posted this in a thread that was in the wrong section, so quite rightly, nobody responded.
However, now you dont have that excuse.


In this thread I&#39;m going to try to convince you that the modern theory of evolution by natural selection contradicts the Christian god.

Evolution is a system that causes much pain and suffering in the world.



For something as simple as slightly darker skin to evolve, thousands upon thousands of creatures must die through no fault of their own.

Why dont you try counting that?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.. and continue all the way up to 1000. How long will that take?
Open vim (or notepad) and try typing that out. How big will the resulting file be?

Every number you wrote represents one creature that died for something as simple the amount of pigment.




For something as complicated as present-day humans to evolve, billions upon billions of organisms must die because they were unlucky enough to be born with the wrong genes.

The number of living things that had to die for you to be here reading this outnumbers the grains of sand in Arabia. If you thought counting to 1000 took long, try counting to a billion!

They died with no comfort or care, no understanding and probably in great pain. It is nature and natural selection: red in tooth and claw.


99.9% of all species that have ever existed are extinct. [url=http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=556][size=6pt]source[/size][/url]



Think of a [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onchocerciasis]parasitic worm[/url] that is boring through the eye of a boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, a worm that&#39;s going to make him blind. Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child&#39;s eyeball? Because that doesn&#39;t seem to me to coincide with a God who&#39;s full of mercy.


There exists a particularly [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneumonoidea]cruel wasp[/url] – a wasp that paralyzes grasshoppers and caterpillars, lays eggs beneath its skin and takes them away to its nest alive but immobilized for their larvae to eat. When the eggs hatch, the catapillars slowly devour the pray from the inside out.

Is it the wasp&#39;s fault that its like this? I dont think so, the wasp cannot live any other way. It has a simple choice of fight for its life or die.



I would almost wish for creationism to be true, creating each species individually is much nicer then letting them create themselves in this way and unleashing untold amounts of suffering in the process.




If God exists, he really can&#39;t be benevolent, and that contradicts Christian teachings. (and Muslims, Hindu, Jewish, etc etc)

&lt;blockquote&gt;For God so loved this world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 



ergo, Christanity is wrong. (Along with virtually every other religion in the world)</description>

<p>Both are the same. Only difference is possibly that the variance of the X will tend to be higher.</p>
<p>If the existence of one type of being implies the existence or non-existence of God, so does the other. And I don’t see how it would.</p>

<p>Oh yes it does, you have to understand what Jesus wants from you. You have to understand that putting your hands together in prayer sends a message to God. You have to understand that Jesus was the son of god, or at least the best and wisest of all men.</p>
<p>Faith and understanding are not mutually exclusive. In the christian faith they understand all these things about Jesus, but they lack evidence which they then make up for with faith.</p>

<p>When have I ever commented on the <span class="bbcode-b">purpose</span> of this pain and suffering? Link me.<br>
All I have ever claimed is that pain and suffering exists in massive amounts and that that implies certain things. I dont know why god made all that pain and suffering.</p>

<p>first of all, it’s spelled <span class="bbcode-b">infinite</span> and <span class="bbcode-b">infinitely</span>. maybe if you weren’t retarded you would notice your browser is trying to help you sound less retarded by pointing out your spelling mistakes. but unfortunately your browser can’t fix what you’re actually saying: infinite food, infinite space, and animals that can’t reproduce. looks like we’re going to need a smarter browser.</p>
<p>and yeah, i know you love pointing out all the fallacies in everyone’s arguments, but please, spare me your bullshit.[/quote]</p>
<p>Chaucer spelt the word nostrils, “nosethrils”. And Shakespeare spelt his name differently each of the times he is known to have written it.<br>
If you’re attacking my argument on the basis of <span class="bbcode-i">spelling</span> then you’ve not got a leg to stand on.</p>
<p>If you find this bit unconvincing it is because it uses christian axioms and logic.<br>
You probably dont realise that christian god is <span class="bbcode-b">infinite</span>. HE will never run out of forgiveness or love or many other things that christians are intrested in. Neither will He run out of wisdom.</p>
<p>Intrestingly, the bible never actually uses the word infinite, probably because it wasnt a word in the bronze age. But phrases like “without limit” and “everlasting” get the point across. There are verses about how you cannot build a structure big enough to contain god.</p>
<p>As the english hymn says, God made their glorious colours, God made their tiny wings. Supposedly God could have made <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> and that includes sterile animals.</p>
<p>Whats wrong with creating a few thousand of each animal and setting them loose. You might argue it would get boring, well who created the sensation of boredom? God of course. You might argue we would be sad because we dont have any sons or daughters, well who created the instinct to reproduce? God of course.</p>
<p>You could think of it as God sitting down and coding a universe (credit: moparisthebest) He could do absolutely <span class="bbcode-i">anything</span> he wants.</p>

It is obvious he wants the world to work out on its own and let everyone be there true character as if he came down on earth and said everyone be good then everyone wouldn’t show there real character and then god would never know who the real believers of him were?<br>

<p>I have, and that picture doesn’t show what they look like. The model of ‘atom’ has changed a few times, and we still haven’t seen one. All that picture shows are electrons which doesn’t mean shit other than that there are electrons there. Even then, you can’t observe the sub atomic without changing it so the electrons might have been created by trying to look at them.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say something like this unless I knew it were true - I mean I’ve studied physics, and learned a bunch about quantum physics.</p>

              <p>Christianity should be followed for the morals to life, not word for word. Many devout Christians have obviously been “taught” from an early age in fairly isolated religious communities, so they wont believe anything but what they are told religiously. Once they have the built in belief in the religion it seems impossible to change their views, so they have essentially been brainwashed.</p>
<p>Let’s say someone edited the bible and replaced genesis with Darwin’s theory of natural selection, and then taught it to an isolated school in some far-away American state. I wouldn’t expect any of the children there to question the theories, and put forward the same arguments Christians put forward. They would just accept this new modified religion. This goes for many other religions too - people just believe and accept it.</p>
<p>To those of you who think it’s wrong/sad to disprove peoples faith, you’re wrong. If you want to follow a religion that’s fine, but when it gets taught in schools as fact and starts conflicting with science there is a problem. How is a teacher supposed to tell a class that god created the world and all the species in it in a week, while a dude with a beard decided that all species originate from simple molecules compiling themselves in different arrangements until a better organism is produced?</p>
<p>Also, I hope my shitty vocabulary doesn’t lessen my point.</p>

I like how you’re posting on a website who’s user base is almost completely atheist. And the very few Christians here will never change their mind on the matter. So there really is no reason to post this. I find it hilarious you all have to continually try and disprove our faith. Get a better hobby.<br>

I must admit, though, I find it quite humorous that they even try.</p>
<p>Also, I have always wondered, why is Christians always the target? There are more than 1 religion you know.[/quote]</p>

<p>I like how you’re posting on a website who’s user base is almost completely atheist. And the very few Christians here will never change their mind on the matter. So there really is no reason to post this. I find it hilarious you all have to continually try and disprove our faith. Get a better hobby.</p>

<p>Also, I have always wondered, why is Christians always the target? There are more than 1 religion you know.</p>

<p>Because other religions, minus Jehovas Witness, muslims. Keep to themselves.[/quote]<br>
I was mainly aiming at Muslims, sorry for not being clear in my post.</p>
<p>And to Muslims, no offense, of course.</p>
