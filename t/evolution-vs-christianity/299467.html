        <p>I already posted this in a thread that was in the wrong section, so quite rightly, nobody responded.<br>
However, now you dont have that excuse.</p>
<p>In this thread I’m going to try to convince you that the modern theory of evolution by natural selection contradicts the Christian god.</p>
<p>Evolution is a system that causes much pain and suffering in the world.</p>
<p>For something as simple as slightly darker skin to evolve, thousands upon thousands of creatures must die through no fault of their own.</p>
<p>Why dont you try counting that?<br>
1, 2, 3, 4, 5… and continue all the way up to 1000. How long will that take?<br>
Open vim (or notepad) and try typing that out. How big will the resulting file be?</p>
<p>Every number you wrote represents one creature that died for something as simple the amount of pigment.</p>
<p>For something as complicated as present-day humans to evolve, billions upon billions of organisms must die because they were unlucky enough to be born with the wrong genes.</p>
<p>The number of living things that had to die for you to be here reading this outnumbers the grains of sand in Arabia. If you thought counting to 1000 took long, try counting to a billion!</p>
<p>They died with no comfort or care, no understanding and probably in great pain. It is nature and natural selection: red in tooth and claw.</p>
<p>99.9% of all species that have ever existed are extinct. <a href="http://www.askabiologist.org.uk/punbb/viewtopic.php?id=556" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">[size=6pt]source[/size]</a></p>
<p>Think of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onchocerciasis" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">parasitic worm</a> that is boring through the eye of a boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, a worm that’s going to make him blind. Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child’s eyeball? Because that doesn’t seem to me to coincide with a God who’s full of mercy.</p>
<p>There exists a particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneumonoidea" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">cruel wasp</a> – a wasp that paralyzes grasshoppers and caterpillars, lays eggs beneath its skin and takes them away to its nest alive but immobilized for their larvae to eat. When the eggs hatch, the catapillars slowly devour the pray from the inside out.</p>
<p>Is it the wasp’s fault that its like this? I dont think so, the wasp cannot live any other way. It has a simple choice of fight for its life or die.</p>
<p>I would almost wish for creationism to be true, creating each species individually is much nicer then letting them create themselves in this way and unleashing untold amounts of suffering in the process.</p>
<p>If God exists, he really can’t be benevolent, and that contradicts Christian teachings. (and Muslims, Hindu, Jewish, etc etc)</p>
<blockquote>For God so loved this world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.</blockquote>
<blockquote>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us"</blockquote> 
<p>ergo, Christanity is wrong. (Along with virtually every other religion in the world)</p>

        <p>We had about this same subject at school today (Goes on a Christian school) and it is just stupid explanation to make doubt about evolution (Like Big Bang is not proven how can we trust the rest of the theory about the start to now), evolution is proven, whatever Christians says it did not happen on 6 days.</p>
<p>Are the any here that thinks evolution is bullshit now? After that good job yakman have done to convincing people the opposite?</p>
<p>Only one thing, in my option evolution did a terrible job with humans, evolution should come up with something better than a virus the mankind now are.</p>
<p>But I think there is a big chance God exist, even the first 3 book in the bible does not all make sense.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is quite common actually, playing the “we cant understand god” card.<br>
However, it puts Christians in an even worse position than they were before.</p>
<p>Of course we can understand an idea of dog, but we don’t conflate an idea of god with it’s existence. Not every idea is implemented in reality. A classic fallacy in reasoning that goes all the way back to Aristotle. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If religious people say they can’t understand their own claimed god, then frankly that’s tantamount to admitting they literally don’t even know what they themselves are talking about</p>
<p>That’s a self-refuting argument for theism. If you don’t know the deity’s mind, how can you possibly understand what they want from you, and if they’re nice, nasty, fickle, etc… Maybe they don’t want anything at all, or maybe they want us to eat boiled eggs on our heads, or mybe they want us to swim in blended hair, or maybe…</p>
<p>If you can not understand X it is by definition both dishonest and futile to make claims about X.</p>
<p>If I cannot understand God, then you too are just as unqualified to understand him. You are therefore unqualified to say that God is good, in the same way that I cannot define him as bad.</p>
<p>This undermines your position far more than mine as yours relies on understanding certain attributes of God.</p>
<p>ergo, Christanity is wrong.</p>

        <p>If evolution is true and that is the way things work.  (might be, might not be, but that isn’t the subject of this thread)  Then that is how God planned the world to work and He is the one that set things in motion toward that end.</p>
<p>Using the same argument that yakman is using with evolution saying that if evolution is true then God doesn’t exist, you can simplify it a lot.  According to your logic, God can’t be ‘benevolent’ since he made animals that eat other animals, causing pain and such.  Take it a step farther, maybe plants experience pain so that even animals that only eat plants are cruel too, precluding the possibility of a benevolent God, right?  The way your argument works is that if there is a smidgen of suffering anywhere in the world God is not benevolent?  So in order for God to be that way, no one or thing can eat anything, no one or thing can experience any discomfort at all, we just go around being happy and reproducing, never dieing right?  Then what?  The world completely fills up with humans and animals, pretty soon no matter what it would be completely miserable.  Even worse than things are now.</p>
<p>God knew it would turn out that way, so they way he set everything up keeps a good balance between different species, giving everything a good long life, relative to that species.</p>
<p>That was the end of my argument, but I have an additional question to pose to you people that don’t believe there is a God. You don’t believe in God, I do believe in God.  The difference is that I don’t constantly sit around thinking up ways that I can prove God exists and try to change your views, where as most athiests I know are always trying to convince me that my views are wrong and there really is no God.  It seems to me like you are really trying to convince yourself.  I accept your views, and if you have questions about mine I will try to answer them to the best of my ability, but you should accept my views as well.</p>

just because you dont constantly sit around thinking up ways that you can prove God exists, doesnt mean other christians dont. why do you think they are trying to prove it only to you?</p>

        <p>Much agree with MITB, just I believe more in evolution than you.</p>
<p>You can prove God, if you could’t he would most likely not exist since only way to know about him was to imagine him.</p>
<p>There is many prove that Jesus exist (5400 If I remember right, how strong them is can you decide self, can’t give source right now since I only heard it, not read it but with little googling you might find something)</p>
<p>If Jesus exist and he had the power it is said he had, that in a scientific way is impossible he most have some Godpower, and most likely be God himself.</p>
<p>Evolution in it self was an good idea, you make a system that will work perfectly with each other, except when viruses like humans get the world out of order.</p>
<p>Think about this from a programmers points of view, if you are going to make a game with lots of monsters and you can make whatever you want, you wouldn’t make every single piece of monster each in one specie different, if you can make a system that makes its lots of monsters, NPC and players in a way you never intended and work perfectly with eachother.</p>
<p>Now the programmer have made the game, if everyone just sat peacefully smoking pot and did not need to eat. It would be boring to play, in a game or life you need challenges and let it be something to live for. Save the earth, save the environment, get rid of poverty. Make life better for people.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Moparisthebest, post:5, topic:299467”]Using the same argument that yakman is using with evolution saying that if evolution is true then God doesn’t exist, you can simplify it a lot.  According to your logic, God can’t be ‘benevolent’ since he made animals that eat other animals, causing pain and such.  Take it a step farther, maybe plants experience pain so that even animals that only eat plants are cruel too, precluding the possibility of a benevolent God, right?  The way your argument works is that if there is a smidgen of suffering anywhere in the world God is not benevolent?  So in order for God to be that way, no one or thing can eat anything, no one or thing can experience any discomfort at all, we just go around being happy and reproducing, never dieing right?  Then what?  The world completely fills up with humans and animals, pretty soon no matter what it would be completely miserable.  Even worse than things are now.</p>
<p>God knew it would turn out that way, so they way he set everything up keeps a good balance between different species, giving everything a good long life, relative to that species.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hello strawman, thats not my argument at all.</p>
<p>If there was small amounts of suffering in the world, you could probably justify it with something like “God is testing us”.<br>
But the amount of suffering we see goes far beyond that, it extends to suffering of living things which did not deserve it. You are struck down through no fault of your own, only because you had the ‘wrong’ genes.</p>
<p>Its like living in Nazi Germany, only nature kills you instead of Hitler.</p>
<p>Your overcrowded and never dying argument doesnt really wash. You’re forgetting that God made <span class="bbcode-b">everything</span> in advance. So to stop that problem he could have easily made our world differently.<br>
For instance he could have made it infinatly large and have infinate food, water and other resources, so that overcrowding is never a problem.<br>
Or he could have made animals unable to reproduce.<br>
Perhaps he could have created the world in 6 days like the creationists say, thats much more benevolent then this evolution method he came up with.</p>
<p>I dont know, in his infinate wisdom, he would have found a way.</p>
<p>Since God made the entire world and everything in it, all this unneeded suffering is the fault of God.</p>

        <p>You are acting like these animals are born and the God strikes them down just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>They still live, sometimes very long lives, they just don’t reproduce and pass their genes on, or don’t do it as well as others with better genes.  Also I don’t think you have an argument with the ‘amount of suffering’, surely that is not something that can be quantified and is most definitely relative.  Certainly there can be more suffering, look at everything humans inflicted on other humans in the past.</p>
<p>Simply put, the argument that “there is suffering in the world, and it is God’s fault, so God doesn’t exist” isn’t very coherent or convincing.</p>
<p>Also, I can’t help but notice you didn’t answer the last paragraph in my last post?</p>

<p>You are acting like these animals are born and the God strikes them down just for the fun of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I dont know God’s motives (if he exists) so I cant say why he strikes them down.<br>
But yes thats exactly what I’m saying.</p>
<p>God chose to have evolution make us, instead of another solution which would cause less suffering.<br>
If God was really benevolent, wouldnt he use creationism to make the world?</p>

<p>They still live, sometimes very long lives, they just don’t reproduce and pass their genes on, or don’t do it as well as others with better genes.  Also I don’t think you have an argument with the ‘amount of suffering’, surely that is not something that can be quantified and is most definitely relative.  Certainly there can be more suffering, look at everything humans inflicted on other humans in the past.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You dont need to quantify suffering for this to work. It deals more with emotions then anything.</p>
<p>If you saw an innocent person being beaten up by 6 thugs, would you feel pity for him? Perhaps you would also blame the 6 thugs for his death? If the thugs said they were all-loving you would probably laugh at them.</p>
<p>So whats the difference with God?<br>
God supposedly created the whole set-up of evolution which ultimatly lead to parasitic worms that live in eyeballs. Since God planned it all out beforehand, the blame lies with him.<br>
Now imagine that same God told you he was all-loving, would you believe him after what you just saw?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simply put, the argument that “there is suffering in the world, and it is God’s fault, so God doesn’t exist” isn’t very coherent or convincing.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Its not very convincing, good thing I didnt say that then.</p>
<p>My conclusion isnt that God doesnt exist, but that Christianity is wrong (Thats why the thread is called Evolution vs Christianity instead of Evolution vs God).</p>
<p>Only with the thinking from this thread, I suppose its possible that God exists but he is an evil dictator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That was the end of my argument, but I have an additional question to pose to you people that don’t believe there is a God. You don’t believe in God, I do believe in God.  The difference is that I don’t constantly sit around thinking up ways that I can prove God exists and try to change your views, where as most athiests I know are always trying to convince me that my views are wrong and there really is no God.  It seems to me like you are really trying to convince yourself.  I accept your views, and if you have questions about mine I will try to answer them to the best of my ability, but you should accept my views as well.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well thats very intresting as I’ve experienced the opposite.<br>
The only Christians I’ve met in the last 6 weeks have been the kind that knock on my door on sunday mornings, while the non-believers from that time have been teachers and lecturers.</p>
<p>I (yakman, as I cant spreak for all athiests) do this discussion thing because I quite like logic and philosophy. Thats my only reason and not because I’m trying to convince myself.</p>

<p>If you are reading in the bible, it does try to hide God going to far in his method in the way we think. And evolution could be a cruel way to make a good world yes and imo the world is not finished yet if the goal was a good place to live.</p>

[/quote]<br>
Though this is yakman’s thread and I may not be correct, i think he’s pointing out a contradiction in God’s attributes, his omnibenevolence. What this means is the god who is defined as “omnibenevolent, omnipotent, omniscient” cannot exist.[/quote]<br>
Correct, and without those attributes the whole concept of God is fucked</p>
