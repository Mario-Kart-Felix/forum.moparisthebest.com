    <title>Scar Divi Autofighter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scar-divi-autofighter/211899</link>
    <description>As you see I&#39;m new here and I&#39;m looking for a free autofighter script that works in Scar Divi. I have used scar before but things seem to have changed a bit since then. I quickly looked for scripts but almost everyone was outdated. I would be happy if someone would tell me what is the best free autofighting sript for scar atm.
Thank you very much!</description>
