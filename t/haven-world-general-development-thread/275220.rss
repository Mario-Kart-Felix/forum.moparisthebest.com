    <description>[center][u][b][font=comic sans ms][size=3]Haven World - The Official Private Server[/size][/font][/b][/u][/center]

[u][b]Introduction:[/b][/u]

The development of Haven World - The Official Private Server is underway!

Some of the features listed below will give you an insight into what we hope to achieve with this brand new project.

[u]We set out with one idea: &quot;[i]To create a highly interactive, perfectly coded, stable, full-world server.&quot;[/i][/u]

This is a massive challenge, but one which we are more than willing to undergo. The following information will give you a brief list of the features we currently have on the server, and specify some areas which we shall improve. Constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome.

[hr]

[u][b]Features:[/b][/u]

[ul][li]NPC on Player Magic.[/li]
[li]Player on NPC Magic.[/li]
[li]Perfect range, with all correct emotes/GFXs.[/li]
[li]Perfect melee timers.[/li]
[li]Correct bonuses.[/li]
[li]Modified experience rates.[/li]
[li]NPC-Player facing.[/li][/ul]

[ul][li]Woodcutting - Several working trees, more to be added in updates.
[/li]
[li]Firemaking - Several logs working, fire creation &amp; ashes. Again, will be updated later on.
[/li]
[li]Basic Fletching.[/li]
[li]Several NPCs for both training and dialogue. (With more being added every day)[/li]
[li]New NPC dialogue system[/li]
[li]New Player dialogue system, used to replace some of the generally used &quot;sendMessage&quot; methods.[/li]
[li]Modified Teleportation system, with correct experience.[/li]
[li]Game Development System written to help our developers.[/li]
[li]Much more![/li][/ul]


[hr]

[u][b]To Do List:[/b][/u]
We understand that we have set ourselves a large challenge starting with a virtually blank source and as you can imagine our &quot;To Do List&quot; is longer than anyone would care to imagine, but we have taken on the challenge nonetheless.

One of the main points we are considering throughout the development of this server, is how to increase the gaming experience for members, as well as keeping the game fun and entertaining for our free players. Members who donate will gain access to new areas, items, NPCs, quests, a larger bank and much more (Just like in RuneScape itself). 

Another key point we are trying to maintain/create is a stable economy, where players must work hard to earn valuable items or hard cash.

We will be adding every skill one at a time, perfecting the gameplay as we progress. New quests, NPCs, new items and new methods of earning cash will be added after the release date (Currently unknown).

For more information regarding updates, information about the Haven World community, or any other suggestions/queries, please send myself or `Joshua a Private Message on this forum.

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Introduction:</span></span></p>
<p>The development of Haven World - The Official Private Server is underway!</p>
<p>Some of the features listed below will give you an insight into what we hope to achieve with this brand new project.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">We set out with one idea: "<span class="bbcode-i">To create a highly interactive, perfectly coded, stable, full-world server."</span></span></p>
<p>This is a massive challenge, but one which we are more than willing to undergo. The following information will give you a brief list of the features we currently have on the server, and specify some areas which we shall improve. Constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Features:</span></span></p>
<p>[ul][li]NPC on Player Magic.[/li]<br>
[li]Player on NPC Magic.[/li]<br>
[li]Perfect range, with all correct emotes/GFXs.[/li]<br>
[li]Perfect melee timers.[/li]<br>
[li]Correct bonuses.[/li]<br>
[li]Modified experience rates.[/li]<br>
[li]NPC-Player facing.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][li]Woodcutting - Several working trees, more to be added in updates.<br>
[/li]<br>
[li]Firemaking - Several logs working, fire creation &amp; ashes. Again, will be updated later on.<br>
[/li]<br>
[li]Basic Fletching.[/li]<br>
[li]Several NPCs for both training and dialogue. (With more being added every day)[/li]<br>
[li]New NPC dialogue system[/li]<br>
[li]New Player dialogue system, used to replace some of the generally used “sendMessage” methods.[/li]<br>
[li]Modified Teleportation system, with correct experience.[/li]<br>
[li]Game Development System written to help our developers.[/li]<br>
[li]Much more![/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">To Do List:</span></span><br>
We understand that we have set ourselves a large challenge starting with a virtually blank source and as you can imagine our “To Do List” is longer than anyone would care to imagine, but we have taken on the challenge nonetheless.</p>
<p>One of the main points we are considering throughout the development of this server, is how to increase the gaming experience for members, as well as keeping the game fun and entertaining for our free players. Members who donate will gain access to new areas, items, NPCs, quests, a larger bank and much more (Just like in RuneScape itself).</p>
<p>Another key point we are trying to maintain/create is a stable economy, where players must work hard to earn valuable items or hard cash.</p>
<p>We will be adding every skill one at a time, perfecting the gameplay as we progress. New quests, NPCs, new items and new methods of earning cash will be added after the release date (Currently unknown).</p>
<p>For more information regarding updates, information about the Haven World community, or any other suggestions/queries, please send myself or `Joshua a Private Message on this forum.</p>
