    <title>Remove Random (Rune-Evo)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/remove-random-rune-evo/514177</link>
    <description>The sandwich lady is getting fairly annoying, and I&#39;d just like to simply remove her.. Not only remove her, but I mainly want to stop the random event. Don&#39;t like getting teleported every so often. I&#39;ve tried figuring out how I can at least change the timer on the event to make it so I hardly ever get the event.. But I can&#39;t seem to figure that out either. There&#39;s a few different .java files that involve the sandwich lady.. Can&#39;t find anything about disabling it or lengthening the time between events..</description>
