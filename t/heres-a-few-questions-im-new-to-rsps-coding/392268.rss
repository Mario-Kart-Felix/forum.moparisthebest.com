    <title>Heres a few questions im new to rsps coding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/heres-a-few-questions-im-new-to-rsps-coding/392268</link>
    <description>Ok, so... i just recently had the urge to make my own runescape private server. I think it would be pretty cool to make my own and have other people joining my server. But i have a few questions relating to coding, clients, servers, sources, etc. so please bare with me and try to guide me through some things.

Question 1: What is the point of making your own custom client if you can just use one such as Silab or Mopars client (if there still is one O_o???) were you just type the server IP address in?

Question 2: I have been checking out the &#39;RSPS Emulation&#39; forums and i believe that i want to use Hyperion as a base. There is nothing but good comments about how its so stable and such. But i really don&#39;t know the first thing when it comes to coding. So could anyone help me about how to add npcs, quests, skills, animations, customs, items, and setup framework? Or send me a guide to help me code...?

Question 3: How long does it take to code your own server by yourself?

Thank YOU for any input as it will be helpful in someway hopefully.  ;D
BTW i know im sorta/kinda a noob... actually i am a noob at this rsps stuff  :cool:</description>

<li>You can actually customize stuff (Load new maps, add new items, etc.)</li>
<li>Hyperion is very good, but you need to do a lot more to it before you start adding Quests…</li>
<li>Depends, answer this question for me.</li>

<p>Same thing for RSPS, since rsps is programmed in Java you need to learn it, you can start <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>You also need to learn about how rsps works, and that is known as the rs2 protocol, you mainly learn that stuff while playing around, but you can also read up on documentation like <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=384128" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>.</p>

<li>It depends on what you mean by ‘coding’. If you meant like using someones source then adding stuff to it, then it’ll probably take a few days/weeks to remove/add the features you want. If you meant by starting by scratch, that takes a while and a hell lot of knowledge to do that.</li>
