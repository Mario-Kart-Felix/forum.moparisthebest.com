    <title>Still cant connect to my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/still-cant-connect-to-my-server/389742</link>
    <description>Im running the server.
Ive port fowarded.
Ive made the ip 0.0.0.0 like the creator said to do.
I still get an error connecting to server.
Heres one thing though.
When i search &quot;server =&quot;, there are 2 server ips.
Was i suposse to make one 0.0.0.0 and one the server ip?
If so, which one do i make the server ip, and which one do i make 0.0.0.0?
This is actually a SERVER problem mods, not a CLIENT problem.
Well, its slightly both. But more of a server problem.

Theres a ip in the client in the source, i changed that into 0.0.0.0
Was i suposse to do that?</description>
