    <description>Hello.

Firstly i am a beginner of editing servers, and I can have a bit problem of where to place a code piece. If answering please show where to put or place the code, thanks.
 
1st problem : basic commands like help and rules

What do i want to build? Simply an pkinformation, uh in same format som help and rules.

I know i can search the code, and i found but it maybe need som editing and i don&#39;t know how, but you maybe can help changing the code and where i should place it?

[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;modinfo&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 0)) {
				String name = command.substring(5);
				        sendQuest(&quot;@dre@The rules of Allstar-Scape&quot;, 8144);  //Title
					clearQuestInterface();
                                        sendQuest(&quot;How to Become Mod/Admin&quot;, 8145);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;----&quot;, 8147);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;1. Respect all other players!&quot;, 8148);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;2. Respect Owners,Admins and Mods&quot;, 8149);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;3. Do not start fights with other players&quot;, 8150);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;   just simply tell an Owner or Admin.&quot;, 8151);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;4. Help other players if they need help.&quot;, 8152);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;5. Play on Server alot.&quot;, 8153);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;5. Higher chance if you register on forums at&quot;, 8154);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;allstarscapeforums.smfforfree2.com and stay active&quot;, 8155);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;_____________________________________________________&quot;, 8156);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;If you follow all of these rules you will be fine&quot;, 8157);
                                        sendQuest(&quot;Just follow these and you will become a mod or admin&quot;, 8158);
					sendQuestSomething(8143);
					showInterface(8134);
					flushOutStream();
   }[/code]
