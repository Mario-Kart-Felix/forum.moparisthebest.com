    <title>What forum would you prefer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-forum-would-you-prefer/546315</link>
    <description>hello!

I was wondering what&#39;s everyone&#39;s opinion on their own very forum choice.
I&#39;m looking forward to a forum where I can get it up going with my server.
The only place I&#39;ve looked at was VBulletin. But i don&#39;t know how the mysql is. ( New to mysql btw)
I&#39;ve done the trial on Vbulletin and it looks pretty neat but how much are you paying? 20$ month, or the yearly blablabla



What&#39;s your opinion personally?</description>

<p>Lol I’ve never purchased vBulletin. It isn’t worth it. I only use it on Rune-Server and whatever site I may come across that has it. And your shit about the budget webhosting, drop it, because I know why you said it. You said it because of my topic in this section. You keep trying to think you’re superior to me, and you aren’t. You’re just a bitch. You don’t like me replying to your threads, don’t reply to me. Simple.</p>
<p>It’s also not a “little” over priced. It’s, in my opinion, extremely overpriced compared to the alternatives.<br>

Somebody’s on their man period. I was mainly talking about justaguy comment. Didn’t even take notice of yours.<br>

<p>I actually do ignore your posts, even on my topics. Lol. There are just times it’s justified that I respond to you (i.e, now, since you’re directly talking to me).</p>

The code is old and clunky. It, in my experience, has always been slower than other forum software (SMF, IP.Board, myBB, others). They’re selling it as if it’s the best software you can get, when it’s not. Not at it’s current state.[/quote]</p>
<ul>
<li>1</li>
</ul>
<p>vBulletin requires way more resources and comes as this giant monolithic application with more than half the things no one ever needs/uses anyway. The code is absolutely horrid compared to other open-source software such as SMF or MyBB which makes it especially hard to make packages (I’ve made atleast one for all three and vBulletin was the worst). Essentially you’re paying for the brand not for having the most efficient, fast, or reliable forum software out there.</p>
<p>The best part in this whole thing as that you can make a free forum software resemble vBulletin feature-wise if you try hard enough.</p>

<p>If you’re feeling like being hipster and want to go with a truly superior forum software take a look at <a href="https://github.com/Wedge/wedge" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Wedge</a>. People who used to work on SMF have been developing it for 4(?) years and it’s went to public beta. Very nice software, worth a look at least.</p>
