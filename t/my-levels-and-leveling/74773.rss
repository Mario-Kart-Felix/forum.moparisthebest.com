    <description>Hey,

My source is Testscape based. my max stat used to be 135.. but i accidently changed it. so it was 119. i changed it back, then it was 116, and if i leave my player standing there, his stats slowly decrease...

also, whenever i level, there is a 3 second delay.

help?

thanks in advance,
