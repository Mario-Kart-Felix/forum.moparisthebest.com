<p>If I can understand it, you certainly should be able to. You need to take the time to read before you hit Quick Reply, do you understand?</p>

 OP:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, well you know how you have to edit the compiler? Well do you have to do the same for the runserver (runserver.bat)? Because I have a problem. See, I change my stuff in client.java and the source that I am using is Allstar-Scape. And you know how when you download a source it says all their stuff (features)? So when I click runserver.bat it says “-Allstar-Scape v1-… Online”, I want to run my server not theirs. Yes, I am a noob but one of my goals for the end of 2008  is to have a server up and running; could someone please take the time and help me?</p>

<p>It’s not hard, you get the gist.</p>
