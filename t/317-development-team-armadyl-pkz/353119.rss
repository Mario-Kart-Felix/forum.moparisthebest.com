[b][size=18pt][u]Goals[/u][/size][/b]
The project will involve creation of a website as realistic to the current Runescape one as possible. Currently, the forums are simple and use SMF. I&#39;d like to create a webclient, registration via website, proper Runescape-like forums and have Highscores on this website. 
It would take a while to complete, but that in its self would be a huge success.
Next I&#39;d like to make the server as realistic as possible. This would involve a very stable economy (Much more than a regular RSPS. More like Runescape, but still not too hard to make money) The economy is the easy part, but then we need to graphically enhance it. This would most likely mean moving to a more modern deob. A 317 would be easier to code, but if need be, we could swap to something like a 602 server.

The following are screenshots of the server so far.

Chaos elemental - Hits normal and I believe it has drops. If it doesn&#39;t have drops, we need to give it good items.

Godwars has all 4 bosses and sub-bosses in each chamber. The area before GWD needs a 20 kill count in order to enter. I&#39;m thinking of making this so you have a counter at the top saying how many individual god kills you have (eg. 20 aviansies = 20 armadyl kills)

A few minigames - Includes duel arena which could be worked on.

Quick chat - tells players your level when one of the skills is clicked.

Thieving gives items which can be sold for money. This makes things more interesting.
