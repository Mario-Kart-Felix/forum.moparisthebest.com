    <title>Back, and still having that problem - still need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/back-and-still-having-that-problem-still-need-help/94011</link>
    <description>I&#39;v been gone for a few weeks for my exams, and I got back and started my server up, after I fixed my NPChandler, it did nothing....  I got rid f all the talking NPCs, nothing, made a new NPChandler, still there...

I am using a Sv3nsc4p3 pk for the source, and am wondering if anyone has seen any hidden NPChandler backups set to come in place if it is altered...

Still need help...</description>
