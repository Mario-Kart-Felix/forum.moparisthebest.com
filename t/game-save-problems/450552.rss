    <title>Game Save problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-save-problems/450552</link>
    <description>Hi guys I need have a question and I hope someone can answer it for me...

Ive been working on a project for a while now and I want to fix the &quot;save game&quot; problem I have.

The problem is that if I turn off the server or log off the client then the game doesn&#39;t save unless I click &quot;Save Game&quot; in the quest tab. So What I wanted to know is if theres anyway to do a mass game save every 10 seconds or something like that, I just want the game to automatically save.

This server is a 317, source is DownScape. HybridPvP v3 Client. Let me know if you need more information. THANKS!</description>
