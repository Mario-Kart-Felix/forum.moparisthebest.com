    <description>Hi,

I was hoping that we could collaborate on an open source 2d game. If you&#39;re interested post here.</description>

<p>A few months means you’re going to be spending a LOT of time on it, even if you’re using a pre-built engine. You have a lot of learning curves to overcome, getting to know the people you’re working with, figuring out where assets are coming from and, most importantly, settling on a single idea and recognizing who is in charge of design for that idea (this is a lot harder than you may think, and probably way more important than you realize). If you want to pull this off, I’d suggest finding some books to buy right away before continuing.</p>
<p>How long do you think those developers were working on that game?</p>

<p>Taharok: I was stalking Frell on Facebook, and found you on his top friends list. You have added a picture of your game and then it was fairly simple to find the video.</p>

It depends entirely on your experience level. If you’ve done an extensive amount of game development before, you have an engine to work with, available assets or are able to pop out decent assets yourself, and have a clear idea of a design, then you might be able to push out a decent android game in a month or two. If you are missing one or more of those, expect a lot more time. Experience is really helpful in areas where you can avoid unnecessary pitfalls you may not have originally intended.<br>

This is your game right? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLaQI4NJWhg&amp;hd=1" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLaQI4NJWhg&amp;hd=1</a></p>
<p>How much time did it take?[/quote]</p>
<p>Haha, either you stalk my facebook page or you’re a beast and tracking things down.</p>
<p>That game was finished by a team of 4 (including myself) in one semester. That was on top of each of us doing 18-22 credit course loads, and two of the devs having never programmed before Fall semester. We basically spent a large portion of our free time (which isn’t much at this damned school) working on the game. That’s typical.</p>
<p>Overall, I’d say it took on average 5-20 hours per week per person, depending on various tasks. Most of the work was done over 8-10 weeks.</p>

With a single man project, what is the unexpected factors I should be aware of? Or put it in a different way, what can I accomplish in 2 months if I was working on an Android game?[/quote]</p>
<p>It depends entirely on your experience level. If you’ve done an extensive amount of game development before, you have an engine to work with, available assets or are able to pop out decent assets yourself, and have a clear idea of a design, then you might be able to push out a decent android game in a month or two. If you are missing one or more of those, expect a lot more time. Experience is really helpful in areas where you can avoid unnecessary pitfalls you may not have originally intended.</p>
<p>If you aren’t using a prebuilt engine of some kind, then you’ll have to end up writing your own. That’s cool and fun for some people, but you’ll more than likely have more fun writing the engine and just spend the entire time writing a decent engine proof, not a game. On the opposing end, the engine may be completely not fun and you may give up on the project before even reaching game development.</p>
<p>Finally, assets are a factor most people overlook. Even if you can pull off the game itself (which is a lot more work design-wise than you might expect), you still have to find decent sound and graphics assets from somewhere, otherwise your designs will either not be able to be created or will be filled in with nasty programmer art/sounds. Unless you are a very talented artist, musician or both, you can’t estimate the time you’ll spend making those assets outside of actually putting them in the game.</p>
<p>Say you know multiple people who can develop, make graphics, sounds, etc. Now you have to deal with having a balanced team, everyone being on the same page for the game idea (often done with a game design document), all the devs being on the same page (technical design document), the artists and sound designers actually knowing what they are doing and knowing what to make for you (you need to tell them exactly what you need, not ask them what to do), and having someone to manage everyone else (often a producer, who maintains a schedule and makes sure everyone else is on task–this is a full time job, not part of someone else’s role). For small teams, production is generally half of the workload of one of the team members, but this is for a VERY small team (1-3).</p>
<p>A lot more goes into the actual dynamics of the team for making a game than one might realize (beyond just the factors driving the game development itself).</p>

More than once I’ve underestimated the work that comes with a game, despite how many I’ve worked on. You come up with an idea and think, “oh, I can do that. It shouldn’t be too difficult!” and the work just becomes so much more than you expected. The content you planned to have in the game comes at a much later time, and the engine is one of the hardest parts to program. You can’t just make what you think you need - you have to design a flexible and very efficient system. You’ll end up spending a lot of time programming systems to make features you want first and optimizing them afterwards. The idea that you end up rewriting every single of line of code at least once is definitely true.</p>
