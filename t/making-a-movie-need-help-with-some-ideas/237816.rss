    <title>Making a movie, need help with some ideas</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-movie-need-help-with-some-ideas/237816</link>
    <description>Hey yal. Turns out im awesome in yet another field of awesomeness. Im the worlds greatest story writer, and have decided to turn one of my greatest creations into a movie. 

Now i know your already going &#39;omg this guy is so full of himself&#39; and your right. I am so full of myself, just ask the people here that know me, and especialy the people that knew me from the kaitniek forum. But the way i figure, go into something thinking &#39;i hope this works&#39; then odds are, youl fail because your not going &#39;omg this is so awesome, i wonder just how awesome its gunna be&#39;. Assume your great, and you are. Prepare to fail? No thanks, i prepare to win.

now that ive explained my awesome attitude towards my awesome idea, i&#39;ll tone down the full-of-myself-ness.



OK, without boring you with the story, ill just outline things i need help with.


My story starts out with 3 normal guys. These normal guys get sucked into a virtual reality game (possibly an actual dimension seperate from outs, not sure yet. Later episodes will explain it), and one guy becomes a super strong guy, ie a barbarian. Another guy, becomes a monk, one of those kick ass bald monks that know martial arts (he can also heal ppl and make small force fields to protect ppl with), and then theres me: a guy who can produce flames, but only to a useful degree when he is in a rage, sorta like a Mage/Warlock mixed with Mr Angry from Mystery Men.


I need to figure out what clothing we should all be wearing when we start off. Later on, we will be changing into more &#39;class&#39; defining clothes. These are not important now. But normal starting clothes are.

Andrew (The Barbarian) is bigger than the rest of us, not really stronger looking, but taller. He is a little slow, kind hearted and follows the leadership of me, and to a lesser extent, Chris (the monk). He is very loyal, and his main defining role in the story will be that he is basicaly like a brick wall, in the sense that you would not want him wailing on you. Start of the story he will obtain a sword, that will be huge, size of a midget. Only he can pick it up since its heavy as hell.

Chris (Monk) belives that everything has a right to live, basicaly hes a budhist, mixed with those hymalain monks that are like Jet Lee (ie, crazy martial art fighting). He is always in deep thought, and his abilities range from healing, protective force fields, and medative fighting. He will only ever fight when he absalutly needs too, and will always be trying to do the right thing.

Scott (Me, Mage/Warlock). anyone that has watched Sky High can remember the guy who could make fire. If you where like me, you would have bet anything that he would have been a viliain, but in the end turned out to be the hero. Thats the impression that my character here will give off. Couple that, with the fact that he can only really fight with his fire when hes angry (kinda like a smaller, less green, on fire, HULK character).


So, if ive done what i aimed to do, ive given you a brief example of the chracters, hopefully enough to help me out. 

I needa know what these characters should look like. The clothes need to reflect there personalities. A link to a pic of the fire guy from that movie gets an A+ from me, cause it might be exactly what im looking for. The others, i need a bit more help on. 



---
Obviosly im much more interested in making the Mage/Warlock look awesome, since its me. So help with the others will really help me, since i wont be concentrating too much more on them as apposed to me :p

<p>Make sure the girl is hot. obviously.</p>
<p>How are you going to develop animation for it? let alone put any in there at all? I’m gonna be disappointed that i see someone making a legit video on here that turns out not as well as i expected. Hopefully you have props and everything set up? otherwise i say it’s a lost cause.</p>
