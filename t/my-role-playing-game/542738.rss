Release will be shortly, First I need some help from you guys!

I haven&#39;t really said much information about the game. It&#39;s like Runescape and other RPGs where you just walk around, chat and fight ect...

I need to come up with a new name, As my current name (Lost in Saria) isn&#39;t very good In my opinion, Your task is to suggest a new name for the RPG and you will win £10 Payable via PP or RSGP (Your choice).

GO GO GO!!!!!


COMPETITION ENDS WHEN I FIND A GOOD NAME.....

POST SUGGESTIONS BELOW! V V V</description>

<p>Why? Unity3D Has many more benefit then just publishing. It’s a free “Indie” Engine that provides great tools.

Thanks for the luck, but I’ve already written multiple of my own. And no, it isn’t as difficult as everyone claims it is. And I find it pathetic when people use Unity. It’s a shortcut in my eyes, with not near the customization of your own engine.</p>
<p>I feel like people now adays just accept everything that’s offered to them on a platter, and never question if it’s better to learn it the hard way. The benefits of learning to write and writing your own faaaaar exceed using Unity.[/quote]<br>
I don’t see how using Unity is pathetic. Would you rather spend x time and produce a good game or spend the same value of time and get nowhere near completion because you had the idea you had to build everything yourself. Are you a very experienced programmer or someone who thinks they know better than quite a large quantity of very experienced programmers? In a lot of cases using Unity is taking the sensible option; of course not using Unity is a valid option too but you shouldn’t slate on the use of unity.</p>
<p>P.S. Add media and change your font colour; as the OP isn’t exactly interesting/aesthetically pleasing.</p>

              <p>Way less text, way more media. Sorry but no one cares when you babble on about all the awesome features of your game, people are just too short-sighted for that. Think about the appeal of your post aesthetically.</p>

<p>Release will be shortly, First I need some help from you guys!</p>
<p>I haven’t really said much information about the game. It’s like Runescape and other RPGs where you just walk around, chat and fight ect…</p>
<p>I need to come up with a new name, As my current name (Lost in Saria) isn’t very good In my opinion, Your task is to suggest a new name for the RPG and you will win £10 Payable via PP or RSGP (Your choice).</p>
<p>GO GO GO!!!</p>
<p>COMPETITION ENDS WHEN I FIND A GOOD NAME…</p>
<p>POST SUGGESTIONS BELOW! V V V</p>
