    <title>Highspeed Camera</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/highspeed-camera/409294</link>
    <description>Hi. I have recently bought me a new cam. It is called Casio Exilim ex-zr100 and is pretty good.
Onw of my friends has the casio ex-fh25. My camera is better but there is two things i miss on my cam he has.
The first thing is the 20x optical zoom. That is okay because mine has 12x and some digital after that.
The thing i want most is kind of pictures inside pictures. The camera takes about 7-10 pictures and put them together.
Here is some pictures to demonstrate:

[img]http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3116/2786117624_73c88e1866_m.jpg[/img]

I was just wondering if anybody knows if there is a way to put this mode into the camera driver or something like that.
If not anybody knows how to put layers into one photo without editing in gimp, photoshop or anything like that?
I can take like 30fps or 60 on 3 seconds. Anyone knows how to take like 15 of theese photos and put them together easy?

Thank You

              <p>i know i could do it in gimp. You just take a movie and cuts out pictures about each 1.25 sec and then merge them together in gimp.<br>
Or I can take like the option 30 pics in a sec or so.  This is actually quite difficult because i have to have the camera still do get the same picture.<br>
So i was just wondering if anybody knew a program that merged them together without any difficulties like 1mm difference in the picture width.</p>

              <p>yeah i know. But i think for what I am going to use the camera for, 12x optical zoom is good enough.<br>
My problem tough is the second question. The one about the layers inside one photo.<br>
I am so facinated by the pictures <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>You could get a different lense to give you 20x optical zoom, you don’t want to use digital zoom, since you can accomplish the same thing on a computer later with a better result.</p>
