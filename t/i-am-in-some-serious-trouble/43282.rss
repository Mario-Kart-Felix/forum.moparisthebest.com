    <title>I am in some serious trouble</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-in-some-serious-trouble/43282</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I may not be able to post at Moparisthebest.com ever again! This is so bad! I hope someone can help me out.

It all started last week when me and my friend were walking home. We walked down the usual route, passing the skatepark when two bullies came out with their skateboards and started pushing us around. They were threatening us, and laughing at us for borrowing Warhammer books from the local library(which is a few blocks away from the skatepark). They stole our books, pushed me and my friend down to the ground with incredible force, and with their cigarette lighters lit the libraries Warhammer books, and skated off back to the skatepark. My friend and I just stood on the ground, crying. Once we got off the ground, we walked back to the library, and told our story to librarians. They didn&#39;t believe a word, and made us pay for the books (which came to a total of $100!) and banned us from the library, until we paid for the Warhammer books, and a fee off $200 each! My friend and I stormed out of the library at an alarming speed. We were upset.

The next day, I wanted to seek revenge for what the skater-bullies did to me. I did not want to see them continue to bully me, or my friends. So I decided to target their myspace account. I knew how to hack, and I knew about Lemonparty, so that was enough to sabotage their myspace accounts. Anyway, I hacked into their myspace accounts, and cyber-vandalized their accounts. They got VERY upset, and reported this to the police (I didn&#39;t know this until the next day). They knew that I did it.

The next day when I was walking home (this time by myself, as my friend was at chess club), I, like always went past the skatepark, and once again encountered the skater-bullies. They pushed me around, and told me that they knew it was me who vandalized their myspace accounts. They said that they reported this to the police, and that I was dead meat. I ran home, crying but decided to ignore it. As if the police could track me?

The next day, all through school I was worried. I was worried that the police would catch me, and I was worried that the skater-bullies would beat me up. School ended. Me and my friend went off to play basketball in the playground. We were chillin&#39; out, maxin&#39;, relaxin&#39; all cool and shooting some b-ball outside of school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, snd said &quot;You’re moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air&quot;. I begged and pleaded with her the other day, but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way. She gave me a kissin’ and she gave me my ticket I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it. First class, yo this is bad, drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass, is this what the people of bel-air livin’ like? Hmm this might be alright! I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said &quot;fresh&quot;, and had a dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare. But I thought naw forget it, yo homes to Bel-Air! I pulled up to a house about seven or eight, and I yelled to the cabby &quot;yo, homes smell you later&quot;. I looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to settle my throne as the prince of Bel-Air</description>

              <p>[quote=“Gorlackgoo, post:1, topic:43282”]Hey guys, I may not be able to post at <a href="http://Moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com</a> ever again! This is so bad! I hope someone can help me out.</p>
<p>It all started last week when me and my friend were walking home. We walked down the usual route, passing the skatepark when two bullies came out with their skateboards and started pushing us around. They were threatening us, and laughing at us for borrowing Warhammer books from the local library(which is a few blocks away from the skatepark). They stole our books, pushed me and my friend down to the ground with incredible force, and with their cigarette lighters lit the libraries Warhammer books, and skated off back to the skatepark. My friend and I just stood on the ground, crying. Once we got off the ground, we walked back to the library, and told our story to librarians. They didn’t believe a word, and made us pay for the books (which came to a total of $100!) and banned us from the library, until we paid for the Warhammer books, and a fee off $200 each! My friend and I stormed out of the library at an alarming speed. We were upset.</p>
<p>The next day, I wanted to seek revenge for what the skater-bullies did to me. I did not want to see them continue to bully me, or my friends. So I decided to target their myspace account. I knew how to hack, and I knew about Lemonparty, so that was enough to sabotage their myspace accounts. Anyway, I hacked into their myspace accounts, and cyber-vandalized their accounts. They got VERY upset, and reported this to the police (I didn’t know this until the next day). They knew that I did it.</p>
<p>The next day when I was walking home (this time by myself, as my friend was at chess club), I, like always went past the skatepark, and once again encountered the skater-bullies. They pushed me around, and told me that they knew it was me who vandalized their myspace accounts. They said that they reported this to the police, and that I was dead meat. I ran home, crying but decided to ignore it. As if the police could track me?</p>
<p>The next day, all through school I was worried. I was worried that the police would catch me, and I was worried that the skater-bullies would beat me up. School ended. Me and my friend went off to play basketball in the playground. We were chillin’ out, maxin’, relaxin’ all cool and shooting some b-ball outside of school. When a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, snd said “You’re moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air”. I begged and pleaded with her the other day, but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way. She gave me a kissin’ and she gave me my ticket I put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it. First class, yo this is bad, drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass, is this what the people of bel-air livin’ like? Hmm this might be alright! I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said “fresh”, and had a dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare. But I thought naw forget it, yo homes to Bel-Air! I pulled up to a house about seven or eight, and I yelled to the cabby “yo, homes smell you later”. I looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to settle my throne as the prince of Bel-Air[/quote]<br>
I would hope the cops had more important things to do than investigate lemonparty on some punks’ myspaces.  Or was the whole thing a joke? Did it even happen?</p>
