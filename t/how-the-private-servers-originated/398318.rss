    <title>How the private servers originated?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-the-private-servers-originated/398318</link>
    <description>Just out of curiosity how the hell do people rip the private servers from Jagex, like the new 508+ servers, people can&#39;t possibly make these files, and this goes for all private servers like WoW servers too, how the hell do people get the files that runescape use to run their servers?</description>

<p>That is absolutely not true at all.  Except that the year was 2005.  We all had “100% deobfuscated” clients back then, from the latest release of runescape, generally supplied by Waffendennis.  We could edit these as we wished and connect to official runescape servers.  Of course there were various cool ‘hacks’ back then that various people posted in the form of tutorials for others to follow, and of course every week when the client updated we had to re-do the variable names and such, just like today.  Around that time, I took all of my favorite hacks, like static colors (for SCAR), map lock, free camera movement, HP over heads, mini-map coloring based on level so in the wilderness you know who you can kill and who can kill you before you see them, and put them together into a client I called MoparScape, I also wrote a really crappy, source based updater for this to update it every week.  It was very popular with the color based cheating SCAR crowd for the map lock and the static colors, and also with the PKers for all the advantages it gave you.</p>
<p>So when winterlove posted his first server version, and daiki promptly made it at least slightly useable, supporting walking, teleporting, and early banking and such, I made all the modifications MoparScape had on the official runescape version and applied them to the 317 client, with help from various people (mostly daiki) to remove things like RSA encryption and everything else that needed removed to work with the private server.  Then I released the MoparScape private server client which got insanely and unexpectedly popular (hence this site less than a year later), while I still updated and maintained MoparScape for real runescape (I called it MoparScape Revolution at a certain point there).</p>
<p>Then as most of you know, Aryan was big as a bot for real runescape, <a href="http://kaitneiks.com" rel="nofollow noopener">kaitneiks.com</a> shut down, I wasn’t happy with any of the other new forums that started up, I started installed forums on <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>, it got big, I updated Aryan for a few months, private servers got bigger and got moved to <a href="http://MoparScape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">MoparScape.org</a>, and here we are.</p>
<p>I hope I remembered everything right.  Basically, I played a small role in private servers, I wasn’t a very good programmer back then and everything I did was just basically following tutorials or getting help from others.</p>
