    <title>Can someone explain how to &quot;read&quot; hex?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-explain-how-to-read-hex/544214</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve got WPE all set up, and I&#39;m trying to understand how someone would decide what means what (correctly), and how to find object IDs and such through reading the code sent + received in the packets.
Links that are retard proof would be very much appreciated as well! (So no wikipedia, since I barely understood that)</description>
