    <title>NetherScape - Bringing back what We loved</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/netherscape-bringing-back-what-we-loved/407920</link>
    <description>Hello, my name is Mike, also known as Bossmous. It has come to my attention that RuneScape remakes are getting quite popular, and since &quot;Mod Vault&quot;s project started failing miserably I decided to make my own version. I am going to call this project &#39;NetherScape&#39; and it is probably my 500th project, but the only one I&#39;ve felt comfortable with working on for longer period of times. The base We are using is a clean Project Insanity. We chose this project as it has quite a good combat base and my friend and I are familiar with coding it.

Our main goals are to complete tutorial island, perfect the main towns like Varrock, Falador, Lumbridge, Edgeville &amp; Draynor Village. What I mean by perfect them is add features like 100% shops, dialogues and NPC spawns.

The development team currently consists of 2 members, myself and Chachie. We are both quite experienced Java programmers and we are very dedicated. We have worked over 10 hours each day 3 days in a row, counting.

We are looking for 2 more developers, 1 who is experienced with web-based stuff like MySQL/Forum/Webclient programming and 1 who is an experienced Java programmer, preferably one who has worked with Project Insanity before.
A member part of the development team will get administrator status in-game and obviously access to the game before alpha-beta release.

We decided to release Pre-alpha to 15 players, and they got to try out 1 part of tutorial island. After 30 minutes of woodcutting and fishing people wanted more and more and more so we just [b]had[/b] to let them access the &#39;Mainland&#39;.

Me and Chachie immediatly coded up some NPC&#39;s in Lumbridge and players started arriving. Here are some pictures; (Don&#39;t mind the bandos and godswords, they will ofcourse not be in the game)

This thread will be updated when we get more content. Everything you have sen so far is about 5% about what will be in the actual alpha release.

Thank you, Bossmous.

Our official site: www.netherscape.ucoz.com &lt;- Will get a .com domain once we grow bigger.
We are currently hosted on a VPS and pre-alpha is open for everyone. The client is available for download at our official site.</description>

<p>I really hope he didn’t say there were too many bugs to fix with hyperipn, because that’s just stupid in itself.</p>
<p>Not there’s too many bugs to fix in PJA, but if he had started with a blank hyperion he would have been fine. Then again he would have to pay more intelligent people to program for him.</p>

Why use Project Insanity?  Use Hyperion if you want it to be waaay old skool.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Hyperion is probably the worst source in the world. Before you flame me, have you seen the bugs?[/quote]</p>
<p>Are you fucking retarded? Before you call someone else a bad programmer, think about yourself you dumb fuck. Hyperion is as clean as it gets. PI is as dirty as it gets. Now stop fucking using PI and trying to remake old runescape with it you fucking retard.</p>
<p>Btw, this is feedback.</p>

              <p>Thank you all for your replies, both positive and negative. I have hosted a PK server 24/7 before, it restarted once a week and it was a PI. No lagg or anything and we had about 50-75 players online.</p>
<p>I don’t expect this project to reach 5k+ members because I’m honest, unlike Vault who says he added PC/Skills/Obelisks and shit when all he did was take pictures of him using the pre-coded stuff. Vault, please don’t post on this thread again and keep lying to your players, oh wait. You don’t have any players, they can’t play because you can’t host a server, 0l0l0l.</p>
<p>Anyways, I will keep coding this project and I’ve done huge updates since when these pictures were taken, it looks a lot better now. I will take new screenshots soon and hopefully make a new thread since this is just messy.</p>
<p>Moderator, can you please delete this thread?</p>

<p>90% of the community uses Delta and Pi! That isn’t anything to brag about. Btw, girls don’t have dicks.</p>
<p>Hyperion is a better source to use but if someone isn’t very experienced, using Pi isn’t horrible, you just won’t get the kind of stability and nostalgic server players want when they demand a remake.</p>

<p>Only retards who cant use it think that. The regular blank hyperion with blakemans edit has no bugs, i dont even think it has any warnings if you open it in eclipse. Project insanity has over 500+ warnings.[/quote]</p>
<p>Correct sir, correct.</p>
<p>Wasn’t Chachie a developer of Near-Reality? Or is that someone else?</p>

There are more bugs on Project Insanity then Hyperion, ++ Hyperion has an amazing gameframe that takes you back.</p>
