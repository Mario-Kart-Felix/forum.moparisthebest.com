    <description>hey, im looking for a download for a server control panel, i used to have a server about a year ago but i just made another and i reinstalled vista, and wiped my hard drive, i was wondering if someone could give me the download or make one, it was a control panel that let you do commands outside of the server, and let you talk and things like that, thanks</description>
