    <title>Router Ports</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/router-ports/483906</link>
    <description>Just earlier today, my brother, for some reason, shut off our router and it changed our WAN IP. It also moved the port 43594 that was set to my computer to an IP of 192.168.1.83. I checked everything that is on our network and nothing has that IP. The IPs vary from 192.168.1.66-81. This meaning, I am unable to delete the port 43594 because I can&#39;t find the computer using the IP stated above. How would I fix this problem besides just changing the port that my client/server uses?</description>
