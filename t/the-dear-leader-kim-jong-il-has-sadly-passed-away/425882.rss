    <description>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16239693

&lt;blockquote&gt;North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has died at the age of 69, state-run television has announced.

His death was announced in an emotional statement read out on national television.

The announcer, wearing black, said he had died on Saturday of physical and mental over-work.

The BBC&#39;s Lucy Williamson in Seoul says his death will cause huge shock waves across North Korea.

Kim Jong-il has been the leader of the impoverished communist country since the death of his father Kim Il-sung in 1994.

He suffered a stroke in 2008 and was absent from public view for several months.

His designated successor is believed to be his third son, Kim Jong-woon, who is thought to be in his late 20s.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>You have to realize that their lives depended on Kim Jong Il, or at least that was how they perceived it. He really was a god to them, which isn’t a big surprise because a divine leader is a key part of Stalinism.</p>

It is pretty sad that North Koreans actually praise him. They should have a revolution in this confusion!<br>

<p>They’re forced to praise him, or they’re carted off to detention camps. They’re starved of outside contact, they know little of the outside world, and of course, they tightly control the little available food in the country.[/quote]<br>
Any country that aren’t able to trade will get problems. What would happen if suddenly no oil-producing country would trade with US? The country would fall in weeks.</p>
<p>I guess NK would be better with a new leader, since it seems like their problem is Kim Jong il and not “communism”/socialism.</p>

I guess you can like him of your own free will.</p>
<p>And Stalin (More Hitler than Hitler according to some retards) is the third most popular Russian: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/12/28/us-russia-stalin-idUSTRE4BR17620081228" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/12/28/us-russia-stalin-idUSTRE4BR17620081228</a><br>
So it is bullshit to claim people only like a dictator because they are forced to.</p>
