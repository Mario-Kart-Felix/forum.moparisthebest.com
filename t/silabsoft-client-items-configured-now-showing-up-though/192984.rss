    <title>Silabsoft Client Items configured --- Now showing up though</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/silabsoft-client-items-configured-now-showing-up-though/192984</link>
    <description>Hello, I have a question. I have configured my server for Silabsoft items, it compiled fine, and now I&#39;m trying to add a Dark Bow to my inventory, only to find out that it&#39;s not appearing.

There were no errors when compiling and stuff, and the pickup error doesn&#39;t appear, so what could be wrong?

UPDATE: The items appear in the character .txt file, but just don&#39;t show up in my inventory.

UPDATE #2: The items have a hover option, that say &#39;Equip&#39; and the things they&#39;re sposed to say, but I can&#39;t see the model. Cache issue, or what?

UPDATE #3 (lol): The items appear to other people. o.o My Cache problem I&#39;m guessing.

Thanks in advance,
Zach</description>
