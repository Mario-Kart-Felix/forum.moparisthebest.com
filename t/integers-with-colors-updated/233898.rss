    <title>Integers with colors?(updated...)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/integers-with-colors-updated/233898</link>
    <description>I&#39;m a complete newbie for scripting with SCAR. I guess you guys hear that a lot on these forums, though.
[s]
I want to create a process whereby the page in a browser is refreshed every 3 seconds through the use of F5. I&#39;ve completed this code, though.

When the page is refreshed, the process seeks out a color(actually, two colors) within a box and the mouse jumps to that place and clicks.[/s]

[s]I know how to do this, though(By the way, is it possible to specify middle click, so that the process can continue even when a new page is opened? I have my mouse set to middle click).[/s]

[s][b]My problem is this[/b]: How do I specify the color? I&#39;ve seen examples of other scripts that do this, and the colors they specify definitely aren&#39;t hex codes. So if I want the mouse to click on a particular color, what information about the color do I need to input?[/s]

Here&#39;s the part of the code I&#39;m having problems with. If you spot anything else I&#39;ve done wrong, please tell me.

This code doesn&#39;t currently compile, and I&#39;m not sure why.
Looks like something to do with Integers, but as I mentioned, I don&#39;t know what their function is.

[code]program New;
var
  x, y: Boolean;
begin
  repeat
    if (FindColor(x, y, 20, 5625340, 3, 219, 717, 320, 20): Boolean;)
      or (FindColor(x, y, 20, 13553358, 3, 219, 717, 320, 20): Boolean;)
      then
    begin
      ClickMouseMid(x, y, True);
    end;
  until (False);
end.[/code]</description>
