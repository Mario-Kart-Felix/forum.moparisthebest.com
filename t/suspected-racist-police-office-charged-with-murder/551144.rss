    <description>I&#39;m surprised nobody has posted anything on this yet.

In North-Charleston, S.C. Michael T. Slager, a white police officer, was faces murder charges after fatality shooting an [u]unarmed[/u] black man, Walter L. Scott.
Below is a video captured by a bystander.
[NSFW]
[spoiler=Open at your own risk][youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyHTWZyiBhE[/youtube][/spoiler]

The Supreme Court has held that an officer may use deadly force against a fleeing suspect only when there is probable cause that the suspect “poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.”

Walter L. Scott was shot four times in the back. He did not pose a significant threat of death nor was he armed. Mr. Scott initially fled because he had warrants for not paying child support. Slager claims his taser was taken by Scott but is clearly visible at the officers feet. As Slager drew his gun and fired until Scott fell down.

There is so much more to the story and so much speculation.. The text above is a quick overview but you can find more in formation below:

Also interesting to note that the average budget per police department employee (not talking about salaries specifically, just budget divided by employee count) is about 50% higher in Norway than in NYC.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what you’re getting at here. Less police is generally bad in case of real emergencies. And yea, our entire population is with you on the marijuana part. It’s slowly being legalized though state by state.</p>
<p>It’s hard though as marijuana eases so many symptoms and helps with so many conditions that pharmaceutical companies are going to take a hit if it’s legalized, so of course they pay politicians to keep it illegal.</p>

We both know how much American politicians like to spend on public services. Less police would force them to focus on protecting the community, and not raid people’s homes for a few grams of marijuana.</p>

Blaming things like the war on drugs on police officers… saying that being an officer isn’t a “moral profession” because of such things.</p>
<p>Something a lot of people are forgetting or not mentioning is that our police are more violent because our criminals are more violent. That’s a completely different issue. That’s things like how we handle gun laws. Yes, you have the cases that get huge news about cops killing unarmed people. But those pale in comparison. It’s easy to say “cops kill 900 people per year here and only 5 per year there!”. Or you could say “cops kill 900 suicide bombers per year here and 5 unarmed citizens there”. Without the <span class="bbcode-b">real </span>details, those tidbits of information mean nothing. Racism isn’t okay and as you can see by the title of this thread the government knows it isnt okay.</p>
<p>I should point out that I came to this thread to defend the generalization being made against police officers. I know there are bad cops. I don’t believe its the majority. Those of you doing the generalizing, I would implore you to go talk to the child or wife or parents of an honest officer than died in the line of duty. Tell them how immoral their relative was for being a cop, trying to keep their community safe. You go get 'em, tiger.</p>

<p>It is true that America has the most corrupt police system of any first world nation (does anyone know anything about China’s police force?), and racism doesn’t only exist in police forces, it is far too widespread. The Department of Justice’s report of the police force in Ferguson: <a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf</a> is NOT an isolated example. Many police forces are run this way.</p>
