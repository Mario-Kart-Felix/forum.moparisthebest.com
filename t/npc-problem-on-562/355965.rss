    <title>Npc problem on 562</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-problem-on-562/355965</link>
    <description>i am looking for a large, square area without many obstacles. i want to use the area as a boss arena.
the problem is that there is no 562 npc clipping on my rsps and players can force npcs to walk trough walls. so the area must be empty. any suggestions?
otherwise, does any1 knows how to make npc&#39;s can&#39;t walk trough walls anymore if a player attaks them?</description>
