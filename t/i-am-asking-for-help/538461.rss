    <description>[center][size=30pt]*EDIT: YOU SEE NEARLY 10 VIEWS NO REPLIES.*[/size][/center]

[color=red]Guys, first off. If you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing in general hit Alt+F4. Now, if you are still here then maybe you can help me and not just read this. I have a problem and here it is;
Everytime I run a client or server I get a problem, the same problem, none of them load. The client gives me this error:
[code]error_game_js5connect[/code][color=red] Now over half of the people who just read that left the page, because it is a &#39;easy&#39; connection error. So now it is all up to you, let Moparscape see what you got for us. But sure, I knew that before I ever asked for help. I knew you&#39;d get that error for a few reasons heres all I knew prior to this;
[code]Client IP/Ports didn&#39;t match Sources.
Client/source don&#39;t match.
Didn&#39;t set your environmental variables[/code][color=red]
Now here&#39;s what I learned;
[code]Client and Server&#39;s revolutions are different.
Versions between client/source are different.
Cache isn&#39;t in the correct place.
Outdated Java/JDK.[/code]

[color=red]I&#39;ve been searching for over two weeks for someone to actually help me with this &#39;simple&#39; problem they say, if it&#39;s so simple then ask yourself this, how has nobody figured it out? Good question huh, obviously it isn&#39;t so easy/simple then aye?

Source: All of the errors are different but has to do with not connecting...

So to everyone who actually read, if you think you can help please comment. IF you have any ideas for me to try, please comment. IF you have absolutely no idea, please just comment that to bump it. This would help lots and lots of people who get this same error. Thanks everyone

I know the first part of this has to do with &#39;Client&#39; and then makes you think this is in the wrong section, but no. I have been told by anyone who viewed me over TeamViewer this is actually a server error but they just couldn&#39;t figure it out. So please don&#39;t move, speaking nobody is to helpful there. For the majority of people, this is where they continue to help.</description>

              <p>Like I said, make sure the cache is in the appropriate place in your client via the signlink.</p>
<p>Your issue (whether you believe me or not) is client sided. How? Because the client cannot/will not download the cache. Being that it isn’t downloading the cache, it cannot load and throws the error_js5 whatever.</p>
<p>Manually put the cache in the appropriate directory in the signlink.</p>
<p>ALSO: Make sure your server has the cache in the correct folder. It needs to be in like data/cache or something. I can’t remember exactly.</p>

              <p>Okay thank you on those corrections, and I cannot supply. I was just told by two kids over TeamViewer.<br>
Then how do I make them connect? Even Package downloads don’t work… :L I do not understand the error man.</p>
<p>I’ve been through 24 and counting different client/sources and none have worked yet.<br>
I also rebooted my computer back to default Windows 8. Followed a guide to downloading the right Java, JDK, and setting the PATH correctly, still doesn’t work.</p>

              <p>“Client and Server’s revolutions are different.<br>

<p>What?</p>
<p>First off, the client and source have a revision, not they aren’t holding a revolution lol.<br>
Second, you’re restating yourself when you say “versions between client/source are different”.</p>
<p>"Cache isn’t in the correct place."<br>
Did you even check your signlink to make sure this wasn’t the issue?</p>
<p>"Outdated Java/JDK."<br>
If this was the issue you’d get an unsupported major/minor version error.</p>
<p>"Client IP/Ports didn’t match Sources."<br>
9/10 sources don’t require an IP anymore, I’ve told you this. Just make sure the client is trying to connect to the ip  where the source is. If you’re running it locally, use “localhost” or “127.0.0.1” (they’re the same thing).</p>
<p>"Client/source don’t match."<br>
This, again, would not be a huge issue. As long as they have generally the same revision and the packets are being handled the same ( like player/npc shit usually) your only real errors would be that the server is trying to load something the client doesn’t have, or vice versa.</p>
<p>"Didn’t set your environmental variables"<br>
You don’t need environmental variables, they are encouraged though.</p>
<p>And yes, this is client sided whether you want to believe it or not. There is nothing here that is saying it’s server sided. Explain to me where the proof is that it is server sided.</p>
<p>Your issue (like I’ve said before on teamviewer) is that the client is not connecting to the source.</p>
