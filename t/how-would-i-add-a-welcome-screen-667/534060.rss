    <title>How would I add a welcome screen? *667*</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-add-a-welcome-screen-667/534060</link>
    <description>Hey all.

I was wondering how I would/could make a welcoming screen appear on a 667? I&#39;ve done it before on 317&#39;s but I still found it rather confusing, anyone mind helping me out?</description>
