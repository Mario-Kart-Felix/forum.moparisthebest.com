              <p>to learn how to change things in game, go to the mopar home page and search what you want to change.  There is bound to be a TuT somewhere on it.</p>
<p>Also once you make the changes, you must close your runserver.bat, and then run compiler.bat, and then your changes will go ingame.</p>

              <p>Ok well this is really nooby but i will help you anyways. Lol first off you changed the things in client.java but you didnt compile it did you? To compile first turn off server then compile and then run server again.  Then you have them in it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
