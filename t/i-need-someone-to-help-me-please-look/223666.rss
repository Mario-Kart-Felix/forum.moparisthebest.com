    <description>In the &quot;how to create a server&quot; thread (http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,285415.0.html) i did everything, but when i got to the part at end where it said &quot;if your server isn&#39;t still up, try opening up your ports 43594 in firewall/router&quot; well i went to my firewall overview and than to firewall, but i couldn&#39;t find 43594 port in the list that was populated. I need help, i did everything but my server still doesn&#39;t work because i think its because of the ports.

Other information: I have a firewall broadband router, and i use a access point for my computer only (the one that im trying to make the server with). Do i have to do something with the router? Because than ill have to change options, details in my other computer with the router connected, and i don&#39;t know anything about that.

Please help,
Thanks</description>

<p>6.after you have done that enter TDC and UDP ports as 43594, if you only have one place to inter a port then put it in as 43594 and make sure the firewall for it is set to allow.</p>

<p>save this and and it should work if your windows firewall settings are on your can try the next step.</p>
