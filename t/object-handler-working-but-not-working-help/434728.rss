    <title>Object Handler working but not working....Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/object-handler-working-but-not-working-help/434728</link>
    <description>I have been trying to get some space inside of my client, and after looking, decided if(objectID) codes were the largest thing inside the client. Fresh off of coming up with a handler for itemused on item, I thought it would be a cinch. I guess I am half right. 
I created the handler like this:

[code]public class objectclicking { 

public void objectclicking(int ID,int objectID,int absX,int absY) {
client c  = (client) server.playerHandler.players[ID];

//end object
}//end void
}//end handler[/code]

In the server.java I added my codes below these locations


	[code]public static ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; objects = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();
	public static objectclicking objectclicking = null; &lt;-----New[/code]


		[code]itemHandler = new ItemHandler();
		objectclicking = new objectclicking(); &lt;----New[/code]

Then in the client.java I placed it here inside case 132:
[code]
			int xDiff = Math.abs(absX - objectX);
			int yDiff = Math.abs(absY - objectY);
			boolean found = false;
			resetAction(false);
			TurnPlayerTo(objectX, objectY);
			updateRequired = true;
			appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
			long time2 = System.currentTimeMillis();
			if (time2 - globalCooldown[0] &lt;= 50) {
				sM(&quot;Action throttled... please wait longer before acting!&quot;);
			server.objectclicking.objectclicking(playerId,objectID,absX,absY); &lt;----------------------here
				break;[/code]

Great news is there is no errors when compiling. The code that was placed in glitches a little, like when a door has been coded twice. But nothing happens. So it is about 50% working. Does anyone know why it is not functioning?
If this is the wrong place to ask, please let me know. I would really appreciate the help with this.</description>
