    <description>so i added G.E and now i need help, with correct id&#39;s for the search bar things.

E.G when i search whip in G.E i click on the whip and it brings a shortbow up??

please help.

oh and correct prices would also be a great help...

im using palidino76 base.

oh and another thing - how to add a decent PvN (Player V Npc)

Please help me with the G.E and/or the other problems

EDIT: Also its when i offer something it offers a null or different item

EDIT2: all of above fixed apart from decent PvN
