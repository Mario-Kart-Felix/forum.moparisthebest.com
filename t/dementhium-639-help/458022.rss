    <description>Hello, I just switched from one dementhium source to a different one (the new one had summoning, my old one didn&#39;t ;P, and I couldn&#39;t switch it over for various code reasons)
And anyways, on my old source, when a character made an account it was a .bin file, in this source its saved as a .txt file... Is there a way I can make it save games as a .bin file instead of a .txt file?</description>

              <p>Yep I don’t know where this is handled since I am semi new to 639s but i believe the code you are looking for is “filereader” or the likes, it is probable handled in actionhandler.java or player.java…</p>
<p>But this is a big butt, converting saved game files from one server to a completely new one might not work, the way a uniqe server handles saves might be tottally different then another one. in some cases this will work with little or no issues (maybe a crash or dc which the file is being converted)</p>
