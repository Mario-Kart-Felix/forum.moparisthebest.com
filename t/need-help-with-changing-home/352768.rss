    <title>Need help with changing home</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-changing-home/352768</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using the PKPlanet source, and I&#39;m trying to find out how to make the home teleport send you somewhere else instead of edgeville, and I want to make it so that new players are also in the new home location upon account creation. When i teleport to home i get &quot;50235&quot; and i think that might lead somewhere.  If anyone knows how to change the teleport coordinates and the coordinates for when new players log in, please let me know</description>
