    <title>Calculating straight lines based on current position and current rotation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/calculating-straight-lines-based-on-current-position-and-current-rotation/548951</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not quite sure of the algorithm to use to calculate a straight line from a given position and given rotation/face. Perhaps there&#39;s an easier way and maybe I&#39;m over thinking how to do it.

Example:

[img]http://i61.tinypic.com/311rw9v.png[/img]

The blue line is the line the object needs to take given the objects current rotation and the object only travels straight. The X and Y will have to change accordingly to keep in this straight line.

Will I have to use some pathfinding for this or is there an easier way?</description>

^<br>
fyi the class for this is Vector2d in Java, Vector is notably different<br>

Or “Point” if you don’t use a lib that has “Vector2d”.[/quote]<br>
ah right vector2d is in javax</p>

              <p>You’re looking for the vector perpendicular to the object’s hypotenuse. Assuming point A is the top left and point B is the bottom right, it’s just:</p>

<p>The logic behind it is you subtract the points, swap the values, and make one of them negative. You might have to change which one you make negative.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you’re looking to step along the line, or calculate the smallest whole-step slope, it’d be wise to normalize the vector, which is to divide by the magnitude of it. AKA:</p>
