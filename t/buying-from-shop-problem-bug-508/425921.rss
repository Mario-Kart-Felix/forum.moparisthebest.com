    <title>Buying from shop problem/bug 508</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buying-from-shop-problem-bug-508/425921</link>
    <description>On my server I have finally found out how to add shops :) but whenever I try to buy something it doesn&#39;t work. It pauses for about 3 seconds then reloads the client and I&#39;m still logged in. I would really appreciate help with this, and would eventually like to be able to have fully working shops. :)

If it helps my source/base is this: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,459671.0.html
If anyone thinks this source is quite bad/buggy please could anyone redirect me to a better 508?

Thanks</description>
