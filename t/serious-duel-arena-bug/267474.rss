    <description>Ok, i beg u all here to please give me some code or something to fix this problem
I finally got duel arena working,but there are a few problems.
When you fight with the opponent and win for example, he gets teleported to lumby and after u defeated him you don&#39;t tele anywhere, but it&#39;s made so that u can&#39;t teleport anywhere while you fight in duel arena, so if the opponent logs out, it automatically teleports u to the duel arena resting place and if you log out it teleport the opponent to that place and says that he has defeated u but he really didn&#39;t. Please somebody help me.
I&#39;m using Delta source.</description>
