Thanks.<br>
I saw this code in the bottom of my client.java</p>
<p><code>
if (timeOutCounter++ &gt; 20/* &amp;&amp; logoutButton*/) {
                misc.println("Disconnected "+playerName+", Data transfer timeout.");
                disconnected = true;
                return false;
            }</code></p>
<p>i think i should change the “20” to like “1” right?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>That code disconnects a player if he/she is inactive for 20 seconds.[/quote]lmao if he changes it to 1.</p>

<p>No, you should just try to try things on your own before straight away going for help and asking to be spoon-fed.</p>
<p>Don’t compare yourself to this phillip kid. Let him go ask for help, he’ll become dependent from it, and won’t be able to actually make his own updates, just the help we give him.</p>
<p>Trying to help you out, if you ever want to be a successful programmer, that is.</p>
<p>If not, keep on asking people for help for every small little thing. You’ll see that in life it’s a lot different.</p>

              <p>You would call this in the Player constructor:</p>
<p><code>                playerLevel[IDOFSLAYER] = 99;
                playerXP[IDOFSLAYER] = 14000000;</code></p>
<p>So much for you being an experienced RSPS programmer.</p>
