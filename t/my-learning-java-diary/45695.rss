    <description>Well, I purchased a 750+ page book called &quot;Teach Yourself Java in 21 days&quot;. I made sure I read reviews because a book with a title as such, needs to be reviewed first. I&#39;m very, very determined to learn Java, and am taking it rather seriously now. 

[img]http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2189/dsc00060az0.jpg[/img]

I&#39;m going to post what I learn everyday, and, you&#39;ll see if it works. So, here we go:

[b]Week 1: Day 1:[/b]

Got the book, and though &quot;Holy crap, it&#39;s massive&quot;, but then I opened it, and it seemed understandable, and the author seemed to have very good communication skills. I had a look to the introduction of the book, and it explained all about the past of Java. What it was originally created for, how it developed and when, and why by. All the usual mumbo jumbo.

I decided to delve straight in on Day 1. The first few pages were all about what Java can be used for, and why it is used. It also explained about the JDK, which isn&#39;t necessary, but very much recommended. I just decided to use TextPad. 

It then went on to explain what Object-Orientated Programming was, and why it was used. It used an example of a Stereo player. All the components are designed to interact with eachother using input and output. 

Next it talked about Objects and Classes. A class is a template used to create an object. Every object created from the same class has similar, if not, identical, features. The example used for this was a modem. The objects were different types of modems, all doing pretty much the same job. 

Using this, the book showed how to create your first application. I was pretty impressed it wasn&#39;t a &#39;Hello World&#39; app. It was a very lightly based Volcano Robot simulator. I first had to create the Volcano Robot, which was, &#39;set to default settings&#39;. I then had to &#39;create&#39; the robot called dante. 

Below is what my finished product was. I tried adding on at the end of the day, but some problems arose, which I was too &#39;new&#39; to be able to sort out. Nothing major though.

[code=java]class VolcanoRobot {
	String status, vstatus;
	int speed, vspeed;
	float temperature, vtemperature;

	void checkTemperature() {
		if (temperature &gt; 660) {
			status = &quot;returning home&quot;;
			speed = 5;
		}
	}

	void showAttributes() {
		System.out.println(&quot;Status: &quot; + status);
		System.out.println(&quot;Speed: &quot; + speed);
		System.out.println(&quot;Temperature: &quot; + temperature);
		System.out.println(&quot;Status: &quot; + vstatus);
		System.out.println(&quot;Speed: &quot; + vspeed);
		System.out.println(&quot;Temperature: &quot; + vtemperature);
	}
}[/code]

[code=java]class VolcanoApplication {
		public static void main(String[] arguments) {
				VolcanoRobot dante = new VolcanoRobot();
				dante.status = &quot;exploring&quot;;
				dante.speed = 2;
				dante.temperature = 510;

				dante.showAttributes();
				System.out.println(&quot;Increasing Speed to 3.&quot;);
				dante.speed = 3;
				dante.showAttributes();
				System.out.println(&quot;Changing Temperature to 670.&quot;);
				dante.temperature = 670;
				dante.showAttributes();
				System.out.println(&quot;Checking the temperature.&quot;);
				dante.checkTemperature();
	}
	
//Below is the part which I gave up on. Gave me some real trouble. There were no errors,
//Just mistakes in the code which I couldn&#39;t fix.

		public static void subclass(String[] arguments) {
			System.out.println(&quot;Virgil&quot;);
			VolcanoRobot virgil = new VolcanoRobot();
			virgil.vstatus = &quot;exploring&quot;;
			virgil.vspeed = 4;
			virgil.vtemperature = 654;

			virgil.showAttributes();
			System.out.println(&quot;Increasing Speed to 5&quot;);
			virgil.vspeed = 5;
			virgil.showAttributes();
			System.out.println(&quot;Increasing temperature to 658&quot;);
			virgil.vtemperature = 658;
			virgil.showAttributes();
			System.out.println(&quot;Checking temperature...&quot;);
				if (virgil.vtemperature &gt; 665) {
					System.out.println(&quot;Returning to base.&quot;);
				}
		}
}
[/code]

After that I moved on to organizing classes. I learned about inheritance, and subclasses and superclasses, although I&#39;m VERY confused about this subject as I don&#39;t know how to create subclasses. There were 4 or 5 pages on this, which I read, trying to understand, but got a bit confused. UPDATE* Thanks to Iamadam, I now know how to create subclasses :) Thanks Iamadam

At the end, there was a glossary, so I read through that and made sure I knew 100% what terms were called, and there was also a quiz. It was hardly a quiz, it had 3 questions, but I got them all right without cheating. The extension task was to add a robot called &#39;virgil&#39;  to the VolcanoRobot class. 

End of day 1.

[b]Week 1: Day 2:[/b]

This chapter was called &#39;The ABCs of Programming&#39;. This chapter was pretty helpful, as it got me well known with statements, expressions and operators. The example used for this, was the Russian matryoshka dolls. 

For the chapter, we left Classes, Methods and objects alone, and focused on the basic things you can do in a single line of Java. 

The first loads of pages was all about what to name the variables and the types of data they are and what-not. byte, short, int and long for the signed types, and then after it went to floating-point numbers. 

It then went on to explain about Class types. This was helpful, as it gave me some tips on how to make things quite a lot more easier for me. It then went on to talk about constants, which weren&#39;t used in the examples. 

The book then gave a simple example below:

[code=java]public class Variables {

	public static void main(String[] arguments) {
		final char UP = &#39;U&#39;;
		byte initialLevel = 12;
		short location = 13250;
		int score = 3500100;
		boolean newGame = true;

		System.out.println(&quot;Level: &quot; + initialLevel);
		System.out.println(&quot;Up: &quot; + UP);
	}
}[/code]

This was to get me familiar with System.out.println. This was only a short couple of paragraphs. 

Then, the book talked about Comments (Simple), Literals, and Number Literals, as well as Boolean Literals and Character Literals. There was a list of character escape codes. Then there was some talk on String Literals. 

Next came the arithmetic and Expressions. Most of it was pretty simple stuff that I grasped and memorized fairly easily. To put me to the text, the book provided this example, to get me even more familiar with how to incoperate the arithmetic in to a script. 

[code=java]public class Weather {
	public static void main(String[] arguments) {
		float fah = 86;
		System.out.println(fah + &quot; degrees Fahrenheit is ...&quot;);
		//To convert fahrenheit in to Celsius
		//Begin by subtracting 32
		fah = fah - 32;
		//Divide the answer by 9
		fah = fah / 9;
		//Multiply the answer by 5
		fah = fah * 5;
		System.out.println(fah + &quot; degrees Celsius\n&quot;);

		float cel = 33;
		System.out.println(cel + &quot; degrees Celsius is ...&quot;);
		//To convert celsius in to Fahrenheit
		//begin by adding 32
		cel = cel + 32;
		//Multiply the answer by 9
		cel = cel * 9;
		//Divide that answer by 5
		cel = cel / 5;
		System.out.println(cel + &quot; degrees Fahrenheit&quot;);
	}
}[/code]

Pretty much, the rest of the chapter was 4 or 5 pages long, just talking about precedence and logical operators and such. 

In a summary, today was about getting to the &#39;smallest Russian doll&#39; of the Java language, using statements and expressions which enables you to begin building effective methods, and then objects and then finally to classes. 

As usual, I took the 3 question quiz, and got all of them right without cheating. I also answered the question, that would appear on a Java Certification test, correct. 

As I was a little bit unhappy with using modulus in Java, and decided to stick to the 1st exercise, and completed after having to some math.

[b]This is my first ever script that I have done without having to look at examples, and all of this was completely from memory. [/b]I also understand that it is very simple Java and I took the long way round on finding the percentages, but I was happy with it, and it worked, which is the most important thing to me at this moment:

[u]The script had to calculate how much a $14,000 investment would be worth if it increased in value by 40% in the first year, lost $1,500 in the second year, and increased in value by 12% in the third. This was the script:[/u]

[code=java]public class Investment {

	public static void main(String[] arguments) {
	int investment = 14000;
	int origInvest = 14000;

	System.out.println(&quot;Original Investment: $&quot; + origInvest);
	investment = (investment / 2) / 10;
	investment = investment * 4;
	investment = investment + 14000;
	System.out.println(&quot;40% increase in value after 1 year: $&quot; + investment);
	investment = investment - 1500;
	System.out.println(&quot;$1,500 loss in value in the second year: $&quot; + investment);
	investment = (investment / 10) / 10;
	investment = investment * 2;
	investment = investment + 1530;
	investment = investment + 15300;
	System.out.println(&quot;12% increase in value in the second year: $&quot; + investment);
	System.out.println(&quot;After 3 years, the total value of your investment is: $&quot; + investment);
	investment = investment - origInvest;
	System.out.println(&quot;Your total profit is: $&quot; + investment);
 }
}[/code]

End of day 2 :)

[b]Week 1: Day 3:[/b]

Hmph. By far the hardest day so far. I&#39;m sure a few people would of found it easy, but the books wording was confusing. It was the first day I didn&#39;t have to type any code out.

Day 3 was called &#39;Working with Objects&#39;. The topics in this day covered were:
* Creating Objects
* Testing and modifying class and instance variables in those objects.
* Calling an object&#39;s methods.
* Converting objects and other types of data from one class to another.

The first bit of teaching was about using &#39;new&#39;. It was teaching what it was used for, what it does, how to use it. When the &#39;new&#39; operator is used, the new instance of the given class is created, memory is allocated for it, and a special method defined in the given class is called. A constructor. 

Next came Accessing and Setting Class and Instance Variables. Most of this bit was about using the dot notation as a way to refer to an object&#39;s instance variables and methods. Next came changing values, which I was fairly confident with. The demo was based on the java.awt.Point package. After came class variables which you define by using the &#39;static&#39; keyword. This gave a lot of examples, and I am fairly confident with this, as well. 

Now came calling methods. It was a bit confusing at first, as the demo seemed a bit complicated, but it all was good after the description of each line, and I&#39;m now pretty confident with that. 

References to objects came next, and the book made it out to be very hard, but once I had seen the example, it looked pretty easy. 

Now came the hard bit for me....Casting and Converting objects and primitive data types. Some of it I got my head around, other bits I had to re-read a few times, until I could semi-figure out what was going on. After came Comparing Object Values and Classes. This was easy stuff to get my head around, and the demos were very helpful. It was how to compare using the &quot;==&quot; and &quot;!=&quot; operators, and using a method &quot;equals()&quot; could easily produce different values. 

The book then started talking about using the &quot;instanceof&quot; operator. There was just a couple of paragraphs on this with an example, and it seemed useful and easy to use. 

Today I learned how to deal with objects: creating them, reading their values and changing them, and calling their methods. I also, kind of :P, learned how to cast objects from one class to another and class to and from primitive data types. There was a little bit on autoboxing and unboxing, but it will be more deeply explained later in the book.

As usual, I did the quiz, but only got 2/3 questions right this time :( I got the Java Certification question answer correct :) 
The exercise was worded badly (in my opinion) and I didn&#39;t really know what to do. What I thought you had to do was way too simple, which I could have done within 3 minutes. 

End of day 3 :)

[b]Week 1: Day 4:[/b]

This chapter was called Lists, Logic and Loops. It was a very easy, understandable chapter. It covered:
* Making a Java program repeat itself by using loops.
* How to make a program decide whether to do something based on logic. 
* How to organize groups of the same class or data type in to lists called Arrays.

The first subject was about arrays. This was pretty easy, but the thing I might have trouble remembering, is that the array numbers start at 0. The rest of the array section was all about them, what they do, why they are useful, how to use them ect. 

Next was block statements. Only a short bit on this because it&#39;s easy. Just a reminder, as such, of using braces and where/when. 

Then all the conditions came next. if, switch (There were 4-5 pages on this), for loops, while and do loops and do-while loops. All of which are easy enough to understand, and don&#39;t pose any real trouble to me. They are also used a lot, so it&#39;s helpful to understand them as early as possible. 

Next I learnt how to break out of a loop, by using break; and how to label loops. Labelling loops took up one paragraph, and one example. Easy. 

The last bit was the conditional operator, which again, was easy to understand.

Overall, it was an easy chapter that helped me learn a lot of important things which I will, in no doubt, be using later on. 

I learned how to declare an array variable, assign an object to it and access and change elements of the array. With the if and switch conditional statements, I can branch to different parts of the program based on a Boolean test. I also learnt about the for, while and do loops and that each enables a portion of a program to be repeated until a given condition is met.

I did the questions, but only got a 2/3 again :( I also couldn&#39;t answer the certification question as it was too hard :(

End of day 4 :)

[b]Week 1: Day 5:[/b]

I liked this chapter :P Don&#39;t ask my why, but I did. It was called &#39;creating classes and methods&#39;.

The first chunk was all about class variables. How to create them, and things like that. Then came creating and defining methods. Again, there was only one page on this.

I was then introduced to a new keyword. &#39;this&#39;. You use &#39;this&#39; to refer to the object to which the method belongs. 

Next was all about arguments. How to pass them to methods. This kind of..interested me. I was 100% sure I would need this, so I read it a few times. 

After came &#39;creating java applications&#39;, although I didn&#39;t make any Java applications yet.

I&#39;m still feeling pretty ill, so I&#39;m not going to type much, but I&#39;ll give an overall summary of the chapter, and I&#39;ll tell what I&#39;ve learnt.

In this chapter, I&#39;ve learnt a lot about passing arguments, constructors, and creating methods and classes. All of it was very interesting, and I&#39;ve learnt some really valuable stuff. I actually cannot wait to start programming and releasing my finished products. I&#39;m very happy I have taken this so seriously.

What I have learnt:
I have a good idea of the relationship among classes in Java and programs you create using Java.

Everything I create in Java has a main class, that interacts with all the other classes when it is needed. I am confident with the following topics:

*Instance and class variables
*Instance and class methods
*main() method of Java applications and how to pass arguments to it
*Overloaded methods
*Constructor methods

I got 3/3 in the test, but the certification was too hard for me. 

I think I&#39;m doing well :)

End of day 5.</description>

<p>I’m almost sure it is xD I re-read the chapter, and I’m starting to understand it more now. What the main problem was, was my personal lack of knowledge of what I learned on day one. It’s all sorted now.</p>

That’s exactly what Mr.Chris is doing, he’s learning to walk before running.<br>
Once he’s got the foundations sure, he can wander off from the book and try new stuff (I recommend you do this. However I highly recommend you to keep on reading the book as you are doing ;)).</p>
<p>I’m really behind you, I love the fact your a good enthusiastic new programmer. I love the fact your learning, it’s great, keep up the good work ;).</p>
<p>And when you do get bored, or hit a hole (which you will, java seems to throw shit at you), just remember, no pain no gain.<br>
It’s the same with most things, but keep going work through it and believe me it’ll be rewarding <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Well, since you are one of the few people on this forum who has good judgement, I suppose your method will work fine. But don’t underestimate the power of just cannonballing right into something - I did that starting with RS2 private servers with NO Java knowlege at all and in under 2 weeks realized just how shitty they are designed <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>hence your current java knowlege.</p>
<p>Mr. Chris, Gratz your coming a long way. you are doing it correctly. javac did it a gay way dont listen. continue with your work[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t really care about what you think anymore.</p>

<p>i actually find it quite hilarious the way you think you know java, im not saying that i do. if anything i have a vauge knowlege of it.</p>
<p>and excuse me? the source is me. i agree, there is some topics which i have no clue on. aka history and biochemical genetics but hey? thats life, not one person can know everything. and if you think you do, your a bigger fool then i had ever imagined.<br>
