        <p>Well, I purchased a 750+ page book called “Teach Yourself Java in 21 days”. I made sure I read reviews because a book with a title as such, needs to be reviewed first. I’m very, very determined to learn Java, and am taking it rather seriously now.</p>
<p><img src="http://img401.imageshack.us/img401/2189/dsc00060az0.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I’m going to post what I learn everyday, and, you’ll see if it works. So, here we go:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Week 1: Day 1:</span></p>
<p>Got the book, and though “Holy crap, it’s massive”, but then I opened it, and it seemed understandable, and the author seemed to have very good communication skills. I had a look to the introduction of the book, and it explained all about the past of Java. What it was originally created for, how it developed and when, and why by. All the usual mumbo jumbo.</p>
<p>I decided to delve straight in on Day 1. The first few pages were all about what Java can be used for, and why it is used. It also explained about the JDK, which isn’t necessary, but very much recommended. I just decided to use TextPad.</p>
<p>It then went on to explain what Object-Orientated Programming was, and why it was used. It used an example of a Stereo player. All the components are designed to interact with eachother using input and output.</p>
<p>Next it talked about Objects and Classes. A class is a template used to create an object. Every object created from the same class has similar, if not, identical, features. The example used for this was a modem. The objects were different types of modems, all doing pretty much the same job.</p>
<p>Using this, the book showed how to create your first application. I was pretty impressed it wasn’t a ‘Hello World’ app. It was a very lightly based Volcano Robot simulator. I first had to create the Volcano Robot, which was, ‘set to default settings’. I then had to ‘create’ the robot called dante.</p>
<p>Below is what my finished product was. I tried adding on at the end of the day, but some problems arose, which I was too ‘new’ to be able to sort out. Nothing major though.</p>
<p>[code=java]class VolcanoRobot {<br>
String status, vstatus;<br>
int speed, vspeed;<br>
float temperature, vtemperature;</p>
<pre><code>void checkTemperature() {
	if (temperature &gt; 660) {
		status = "returning home";
		speed = 5;
	}
}

void showAttributes() {
	System.out.println("Status: " + status);
	System.out.println("Speed: " + speed);
	System.out.println("Temperature: " + temperature);
	System.out.println("Status: " + vstatus);
	System.out.println("Speed: " + vspeed);
	System.out.println("Temperature: " + vtemperature);
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>[code=java]class VolcanoApplication {<br>
public static void main(String[] arguments) {<br>
VolcanoRobot dante = new VolcanoRobot();<br>
dante.status = “exploring”;<br>
dante.speed = 2;<br>
dante.temperature = 510;</p>
<pre><code>			dante.showAttributes();
			System.out.println("Increasing Speed to 3.");
			dante.speed = 3;
			dante.showAttributes();
			System.out.println("Changing Temperature to 670.");
			dante.temperature = 670;
			dante.showAttributes();
			System.out.println("Checking the temperature.");
			dante.checkTemperature();
}
</code></pre>
<p>//Below is the part which I gave up on. Gave me some real trouble. There were no errors,<br>
//Just mistakes in the code which I couldn’t fix.</p>
<pre><code>	public static void subclass(String[] arguments) {
		System.out.println("Virgil");
		VolcanoRobot virgil = new VolcanoRobot();
		virgil.vstatus = "exploring";
		virgil.vspeed = 4;
		virgil.vtemperature = 654;

		virgil.showAttributes();
		System.out.println("Increasing Speed to 5");
		virgil.vspeed = 5;
		virgil.showAttributes();
		System.out.println("Increasing temperature to 658");
		virgil.vtemperature = 658;
		virgil.showAttributes();
		System.out.println("Checking temperature...");
			if (virgil.vtemperature &gt; 665) {
				System.out.println("Returning to base.");
			}
	}
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
[/code]</p>
<p>After that I moved on to organizing classes. I learned about inheritance, and subclasses and superclasses, although I’m VERY confused about this subject as I don’t know how to create subclasses. There were 4 or 5 pages on this, which I read, trying to understand, but got a bit confused. UPDATE* Thanks to Iamadam, I now know how to create subclasses <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Thanks Iamadam</p>
<p>At the end, there was a glossary, so I read through that and made sure I knew 100% what terms were called, and there was also a quiz. It was hardly a quiz, it had 3 questions, but I got them all right without cheating. The extension task was to add a robot called ‘virgil’  to the VolcanoRobot class.</p>
<p>End of day 1.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Week 1: Day 2:</span></p>
<p>This chapter was called ‘The ABCs of Programming’. This chapter was pretty helpful, as it got me well known with statements, expressions and operators. The example used for this, was the Russian matryoshka dolls.</p>
<p>For the chapter, we left Classes, Methods and objects alone, and focused on the basic things you can do in a single line of Java.</p>
<p>The first loads of pages was all about what to name the variables and the types of data they are and what-not. byte, short, int and long for the signed types, and then after it went to floating-point numbers.</p>
<p>It then went on to explain about Class types. This was helpful, as it gave me some tips on how to make things quite a lot more easier for me. It then went on to talk about constants, which weren’t used in the examples.</p>
<p>The book then gave a simple example below:</p>
<p>[code=java]public class Variables {</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] arguments) {
	final char UP = 'U';
	byte initialLevel = 12;
	short location = 13250;
	int score = 3500100;
	boolean newGame = true;

	System.out.println("Level: " + initialLevel);
	System.out.println("Up: " + UP);
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>This was to get me familiar with System.out.println. This was only a short couple of paragraphs.</p>
<p>Then, the book talked about Comments (Simple), Literals, and Number Literals, as well as Boolean Literals and Character Literals. There was a list of character escape codes. Then there was some talk on String Literals.</p>
<p>Next came the arithmetic and Expressions. Most of it was pretty simple stuff that I grasped and memorized fairly easily. To put me to the text, the book provided this example, to get me even more familiar with how to incoperate the arithmetic in to a script.</p>
<p>[code=java]public class Weather {<br>
public static void main(String[] arguments) {<br>
float fah = 86;<br>
System.out.println(fah + " degrees Fahrenheit is …");<br>
//To convert fahrenheit in to Celsius<br>
//Begin by subtracting 32<br>
fah = fah - 32;<br>
//Divide the answer by 9<br>
fah = fah / 9;<br>
//Multiply the answer by 5<br>
fah = fah * 5;<br>
System.out.println(fah + " degrees Celsius\n");</p>
<pre><code>	float cel = 33;
	System.out.println(cel + " degrees Celsius is ...");
	//To convert celsius in to Fahrenheit
	//begin by adding 32
	cel = cel + 32;
	//Multiply the answer by 9
	cel = cel * 9;
	//Divide that answer by 5
	cel = cel / 5;
	System.out.println(cel + " degrees Fahrenheit");
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>Pretty much, the rest of the chapter was 4 or 5 pages long, just talking about precedence and logical operators and such.</p>
<p>In a summary, today was about getting to the ‘smallest Russian doll’ of the Java language, using statements and expressions which enables you to begin building effective methods, and then objects and then finally to classes.</p>
<p>As usual, I took the 3 question quiz, and got all of them right without cheating. I also answered the question, that would appear on a Java Certification test, correct.</p>
<p>As I was a little bit unhappy with using modulus in Java, and decided to stick to the 1st exercise, and completed after having to some math.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This is my first ever script that I have done without having to look at examples, and all of this was completely from memory. </span>I also understand that it is very simple Java and I took the long way round on finding the percentages, but I was happy with it, and it worked, which is the most important thing to me at this moment:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The script had to calculate how much a $14,000 investment would be worth if it increased in value by 40% in the first year, lost $1,500 in the second year, and increased in value by 12% in the third. This was the script:</span></p>
<p>[code=java]public class Investment {</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] arguments) {
int investment = 14000;
int origInvest = 14000;

System.out.println("Original Investment: $" + origInvest);
investment = (investment / 2) / 10;
investment = investment * 4;
investment = investment + 14000;
System.out.println("40% increase in value after 1 year: $" + investment);
investment = investment - 1500;
System.out.println("$1,500 loss in value in the second year: $" + investment);
investment = (investment / 10) / 10;
investment = investment * 2;
investment = investment + 1530;
investment = investment + 15300;
System.out.println("12% increase in value in the second year: $" + investment);
System.out.println("After 3 years, the total value of your investment is: $" + investment);
investment = investment - origInvest;
System.out.println("Your total profit is: $" + investment);
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>End of day 2 <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Week 1: Day 3:</span></p>
<p>Hmph. By far the hardest day so far. I’m sure a few people would of found it easy, but the books wording was confusing. It was the first day I didn’t have to type any code out.</p>
<p>Day 3 was called ‘Working with Objects’. The topics in this day covered were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating Objects</li>
<li>Testing and modifying class and instance variables in those objects.</li>
<li>Calling an object’s methods.</li>
<li>Converting objects and other types of data from one class to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first bit of teaching was about using ‘new’. It was teaching what it was used for, what it does, how to use it. When the ‘new’ operator is used, the new instance of the given class is created, memory is allocated for it, and a special method defined in the given class is called. A constructor.</p>
<p>Next came Accessing and Setting Class and Instance Variables. Most of this bit was about using the dot notation as a way to refer to an object’s instance variables and methods. Next came changing values, which I was fairly confident with. The demo was based on the java.awt.Point package. After came class variables which you define by using the ‘static’ keyword. This gave a lot of examples, and I am fairly confident with this, as well.</p>
<p>Now came calling methods. It was a bit confusing at first, as the demo seemed a bit complicated, but it all was good after the description of each line, and I’m now pretty confident with that.</p>
<p>References to objects came next, and the book made it out to be very hard, but once I had seen the example, it looked pretty easy.</p>
<p>Now came the hard bit for me…Casting and Converting objects and primitive data types. Some of it I got my head around, other bits I had to re-read a few times, until I could semi-figure out what was going on. After came Comparing Object Values and Classes. This was easy stuff to get my head around, and the demos were very helpful. It was how to compare using the “==” and “!=” operators, and using a method “equals()” could easily produce different values.</p>
<p>The book then started talking about using the “instanceof” operator. There was just a couple of paragraphs on this with an example, and it seemed useful and easy to use.</p>
<p>Today I learned how to deal with objects: creating them, reading their values and changing them, and calling their methods. I also, kind of :P, learned how to cast objects from one class to another and class to and from primitive data types. There was a little bit on autoboxing and unboxing, but it will be more deeply explained later in the book.</p>
<p>As usual, I did the quiz, but only got 2/3 questions right this time <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning1bce.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I got the Java Certification question answer correct <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
The exercise was worded badly (in my opinion) and I didn’t really know what to do. What I thought you had to do was way too simple, which I could have done within 3 minutes.</p>
<p>End of day 3 <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Week 1: Day 4:</span></p>
<p>This chapter was called Lists, Logic and Loops. It was a very easy, understandable chapter. It covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making a Java program repeat itself by using loops.</li>
<li>How to make a program decide whether to do something based on logic.</li>
<li>How to organize groups of the same class or data type in to lists called Arrays.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first subject was about arrays. This was pretty easy, but the thing I might have trouble remembering, is that the array numbers start at 0. The rest of the array section was all about them, what they do, why they are useful, how to use them ect.</p>
<p>Next was block statements. Only a short bit on this because it’s easy. Just a reminder, as such, of using braces and where/when.</p>
<p>Then all the conditions came next. if, switch (There were 4-5 pages on this), for loops, while and do loops and do-while loops. All of which are easy enough to understand, and don’t pose any real trouble to me. They are also used a lot, so it’s helpful to understand them as early as possible.</p>
<p>Next I learnt how to break out of a loop, by using break; and how to label loops. Labelling loops took up one paragraph, and one example. Easy.</p>
<p>The last bit was the conditional operator, which again, was easy to understand.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an easy chapter that helped me learn a lot of important things which I will, in no doubt, be using later on.</p>
<p>I learned how to declare an array variable, assign an object to it and access and change elements of the array. With the if and switch conditional statements, I can branch to different parts of the program based on a Boolean test. I also learnt about the for, while and do loops and that each enables a portion of a program to be repeated until a given condition is met.</p>
<p>I did the questions, but only got a 2/3 again <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning1bce.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> I also couldn’t answer the certification question as it was too hard <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning1bce.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>End of day 4 <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Week 1: Day 5:</span></p>
<p>I liked this chapter <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue1bce.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Don’t ask my why, but I did. It was called ‘creating classes and methods’.</p>
<p>The first chunk was all about class variables. How to create them, and things like that. Then came creating and defining methods. Again, there was only one page on this.</p>
<p>I was then introduced to a new keyword. ‘this’. You use ‘this’ to refer to the object to which the method belongs.</p>
<p>Next was all about arguments. How to pass them to methods. This kind of…interested me. I was 100% sure I would need this, so I read it a few times.</p>
<p>After came ‘creating java applications’, although I didn’t make any Java applications yet.</p>
<p>I’m still feeling pretty ill, so I’m not going to type much, but I’ll give an overall summary of the chapter, and I’ll tell what I’ve learnt.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I’ve learnt a lot about passing arguments, constructors, and creating methods and classes. All of it was very interesting, and I’ve learnt some really valuable stuff. I actually cannot wait to start programming and releasing my finished products. I’m very happy I have taken this so seriously.</p>
<p>What I have learnt:<br>
I have a good idea of the relationship among classes in Java and programs you create using Java.</p>
<p>Everything I create in Java has a main class, that interacts with all the other classes when it is needed. I am confident with the following topics:</p>
<p>*Instance and class variables<br>
*Instance and class methods<br>
*main() method of Java applications and how to pass arguments to it<br>
*Overloaded methods<br>
*Constructor methods</p>
<p>I got 3/3 in the test, but the certification was too hard for me.</p>
<p>I think I’m doing well <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile1bce.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Don’t name your instances random things, Dante and Virgil? Wuzzat. Also, indent properly and use regular code tags. Get yourself a decent IDE, such as IDEA, it speeds things along. What problem did you have? Saying “Houston, we have a problem.” doesn’t mean much. Saying “Houston, we ran out of fuel,” means you’re fucked though.</p>

        <p>Dante and Virgil were the names of the ‘robots’ the book came up with. I just played along with it. I doesn’t harm. Also, I’m not too sure on how to indent properly. Any chance of a quick sloppy guide via a PM?</p>

        <p>I’ll just post it here, it’s pretty short.</p>
<p>Indent whenever you start a new block of code, ie, an area enclosed by brackets.<br>
Indent consistently. Indent the same way everywhere.<br>
Use spaces rather than tabs.</p>
<p>I don’t have time to get to the details, but here’s a formatted copy of your program.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p>[code]class VolcanoApplication {<br>
public static void main(String[] arguments) {<br>
VolcanoRobot dante = new VolcanoRobot();<br>
dante.status = “exploring”;<br>
dante.speed = 2;<br>
dante.temperature = 510;</p>
<pre><code>			dante.showAttributes();
			System.out.println("Increasing Speed to 3.");
			dante.speed = 3;
			dante.showAttributes();
			System.out.println("Changing Temperature to 670.");
			dante.temperature = 670;
			dante.showAttributes();
			System.out.println("Checking the temperature.");
			dante.checkTemperature();
}
</code></pre>
<p>//Below is the part which I gave up on. Gave me some real trouble. There were no errors,<br>
//Just mistakes in the code which I couldn’t fix.</p>
<pre><code>	public static void subclass(String[] arguments) {
		System.out.println("Virgil");
		VolcanoRobot virgil = new VolcanoRobot();
		virgil.vstatus = "exploring";
		virgil.vspeed = 4;
		virgil.vtemperature = 654;

		virgil.showAttributes();
		System.out.println("Increasing Speed to 5");
		virgil.vspeed = 5;
		virgil.showAttributes();
		System.out.println("Increasing temperature to 658");
		virgil.vtemperature = 658;
		virgil.showAttributes();
		System.out.println("Checking temperature...");
			if (virgil.vtemperature &gt; 665) {
				System.out.println("Returning to base.");
			}
	}
</code></pre>
<p>}<br>
[/code]</p>
<p>After:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">class VolcanoApplication {
     public static void main(String[] arguments) {
          VolcanoRobot dante = new VolcanoRobot();
          dante.status = "exploring";

          dante.temperature = 510;

        <p>I’m sorry, but I must admit, making things like “VolcanoRobot” and whatever shit you made is retarded. If you’re going to try and learn Java that way, you are not going to enjoy it nor understand the power it encompasses. Start off with something AWT, like</p>
<p><code>
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
public class AWTShit implements WindowListener{
   static Frame f;
   public static void main(String[] ga){
       f = new Frame("AWTShitFrame");
       f.setSize(500,500);
       f.addWindowListener(new AWTShit());
       f.show();
   }
   public void windowActivated(WindowEvent we){}
   public void windowDeactivated(WindowEvent we){}
   public void windowClosing(WindowEvene we){
      f.dispose();
   }
   public void windowIconified(WindowEvent we){}
   public void windowDeiconified(WindowEvent we){}

        <p>Well, I haven’t learnt anything of what was in your script. I’ve been learning for 2 days, you can hardly expect much from me.</p>
<p>I am also enjoying it very much. As soon as I get back from school, I’m straight in to the book.</p>
<p>I have ALOT more stuff to learn, and I’m only 40 or so pages through this 700 page book. I read the end page, and some of the stuff that I’ll be being taught seems pretty nice.</p>
<p>Also, who’s to say this will be the only book I’ll be learning from? This is a begginners books. I’d much rather get through this, learn what I need to know, and move on to a more experienced book.</p>

        <p>The saying “don’t run before you can walk” pops to mind.<br>
That’s exactly what Mr.Chris is doing, he’s learning to walk before running.<br>
Once he’s got the foundations sure, he can wander off from the book and try new stuff (I recommend you do this. However I highly recommend you to keep on reading the book as you are doing ;)).</p>
<p>I’m really behind you, I love the fact your a good enthusiastic new programmer. I love the fact your learning, it’s great, keep up the good work ;).</p>
<p>And when you do get bored, or hit a hole (which you will, java seems to throw shit at you), just remember, no pain no gain.<br>
It’s the same with most things, but keep going work through it and believe me it’ll be rewarding <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/wink1bce.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Thanks ownagesbot. I’m very detirmined to learn Java, yet I’m in no rush to do so. I like to keep a steady pace that I can happily learn at. If something gets too hard for, I’ll keep trying until I get it right.</p>
