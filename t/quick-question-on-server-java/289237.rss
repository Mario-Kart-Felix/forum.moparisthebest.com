    <title>Quick question on server.java</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quick-question-on-server-java/289237</link>
    <description>Sorry guys, this is probbably self explanatory, but my router was all sorts of messed up, and i port forwarded two of them to get to this point (should only be like a 15 minute job but it took me 3 hours) &gt;.&lt; anyway, when i change the IP from &quot;localhost&quot; in my server java do i use my internal, or my external ip adress? Same with the client, in the settings java. Both internal, or external to make it public for everyone? I port forwarded port 80 and  43594 or whatever it was.. Any help would be appreciated. thanks in advance :)</description>
