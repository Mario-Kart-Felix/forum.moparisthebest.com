    <description>MSN: *

I&#39;m mobile so you can reach me at any time I&#39;ll respond if I&#39;m not busy.

Info: Ok so basically I&#39;m a facilitator I will do anything that you give me an I&#39;ll give 110% effort all the time even if I don&#39;t know how to do w/e is I&#39;ll find out how to do it. I&#39;m also an idealist I have some good Ideas for servers and economys so just message me let me know what you need an I&#39;ll try my best to do it I only do 317 server coding so anything other than 317 don&#39;t ask me I&#39;m also not good with regardless clients.

About me: here&#39;s some info about me I&#39;m 16 years old I&#39;m in 10th grade at high school this year I&#39;m taking computer development classes as well as web page designing I&#39;m also a varsity wrestler. I have been playing RSPS for about 4-5 years and coding for about 1 year I have experience in staff positions as well as owner/co-owner of some servers with my friends. I like servers where the staff talks to there players an everyone knows each other an gets a long that makes the community grow an more fun for the players an I know some ways to make a server like that.

Well i guess that&#39;s a little about me so I don&#39;t want to bore you guys to death so if there&#39;s anything you want to know message me on MSN only way you will get a hold unless I come on here an you get me while I&#39;m online ok well thanks for reading
