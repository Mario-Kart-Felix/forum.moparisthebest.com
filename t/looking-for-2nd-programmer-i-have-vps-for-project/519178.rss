    <title>Looking For 2nd Programmer (I have VPS) For Project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-2nd-programmer-i-have-vps-for-project/519178</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for a 2nd programmer for a project.

I&#39;ve got a vps.

I want to clean up a source/client I have, which I&#39;ve already begun on.
There are a few players on it off and on to help find bugs etc too.

I do have funds for a webhost, domain and a vps monthly, but I want to fix it up before I throw a site up for it.
But again, there are people playing it off and on so that helps with testing some stuff etc.

I do plan to host this rsps to the public after it is fixed up more, as I&#39;ve a fairly large quantity of friends waiting to play it who will advertise too once released for the public.


This base is NOT PI. 

If you&#39;re interested and/or would like more information, please contact me.

My Skype is  SlyAsMich.
Or you can reply to this thread or inbox me.

Thanks,
Mich_</description>
