    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-create-your-own-rsps/542630</link>
    <description>Hello moparcape today im going to be showing you how to create you very own rsps

* you will need *
1.RSPS FILES (source,clien,cache)
2.latest version of jdk  
3.winrar

DOWNLOADING
 Find your own rsps files and download them
JDk - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
winrar - http://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&amp;L=0

Setting correct methods
1.Before running your source go to you run.bat right click then click edit
2.go to computer then C: drive then program files or program files (x86) depending on the type of PC you have
3.open you program files /program files (x86) look for java click on java you will see something like jdk and numbers maybe like jdk1.7.0_55
4. now in ur notepad of run.bat after you clicked edit change the jdk in the bat file to your correct jdk files
          For example 
If i says &quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_51 change the jdk1.7.0_51 to the java you found in your program file
now if The server dosnt have a jdk and says high men gui or something along those lines just leave it alone

* Do all these steps 1-4 for your run.bat and compiler.bat in source and also in your client!

Now run the server and then open the client after letting the source load to prevent the j5 connect error or watever

NOW YOU HAVE YOUR OWN RUNESCAPE PRIVATE SERVER NOW TO PORT FORWARD! will add sometime today :) in a hour or so  and going to add pictures and mabey a video!</description>
