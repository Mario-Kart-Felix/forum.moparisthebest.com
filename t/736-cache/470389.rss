    <title>736 cache?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/736-cache/470389</link>
    <description>Looking for a 736 Or 739 Cache, I Have Downloaded Over 5GB in Caches Today.. And I Am Only Finding one with No Map Data, Or NULL&#39;s in the MAP...

I am trying to run the cache Through NRS3server V4. But all the Higher Caches Seem to have Wrong NPC Animations, And npcs They are In the Wrong Spots? And map data is missing..

Anyone Know what could be coursing this? Do i need to edit something?
I am Quiet New to Whole 718+ Still learning actually..
IF someone coulld mail me a link to one which works. i would love it!

It would be apreicated If anyone could help~!

Thankyou in advance.
