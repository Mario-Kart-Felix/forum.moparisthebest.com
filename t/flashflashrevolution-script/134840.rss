    <title>FlashFlashRevolution script</title>

    <description>If you dont know the game FFR, its pretty much an online DDR game but with the computer and arrow keys.

I was hoping that someone would be good enough at scripting to be able to make it so it clicks the right arrow key at the right time. I bet theres lots of ways of doing it but i only came up with one way. Maybe you could use the cursor to see if the arrow is in the designated arrow box. Then, if it is, it would follow that up by clicking the arrow key. So pretty much the cursor is going back and forth across the top row checking if an arrow is in the box, then it would click said arrow key. It would be very challenging but i bet someone would be up to the task.

I am open to all ideas on how to make it work.
