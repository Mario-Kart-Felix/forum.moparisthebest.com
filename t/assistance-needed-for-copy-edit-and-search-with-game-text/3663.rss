    <title>Assistance needed for copy,edit and search with game text</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/assistance-needed-for-copy-edit-and-search-with-game-text/3663</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I want to take some text from a game, edit it and then use that as a search string in my script.
Is this even possible?

I can copy and paste the text that I need to edit. 
It would look something like this in its raw form

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx49xx 
or 
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx8xx

where the Xs represent random text.

All I want is the number (or numbers) at the end for a IsTextInAreaEx type search.
I have my font loaded and ready to go... I just need to grab the search string ;)

Any suggestions for how I might be able to do this?

All assistance gratefully received :)

Thanks in advance

              <p>Thanks for pointing out the confusing bits Chrisface, I need to clarify.</p>
<p>(random number of Xs)xxxx_(2/49)_<br>
is a random set of characters (represented by Xs) followed by the bit I want.<br>
The underscores represent spaces.</p>
<p>Thinking about it</p>
<p>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx49xx<br>
or<br>
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx8xx</p>
<p>Would have been more helpful.</p>
<p>I just want the numbers but there might be 1 or 2 digits</p>
<p>I will edit the post to reflect this.</p>
<p>Thanks also for the load font example, I already have the one I need in my script <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I have absaloutley no comprehension on what the hell you’re trying to do with that code you showed us there…<br>
Are the bits in brackets variables? and what the hell is with the xxxxxxxx? the underscore just confuses things even further because thats sometimes used as seperation between words in a variable or at the START of variables in C++.</p>
<p>To use the is text in area function you will need to define the font you are looking for.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//UpgradeFont Is an integer. 
//LoadCharsFromFont2(font name, font size, bold, italic, underscore, strikethrough)
UpgradeFont := loadCharsFromFont2('Courier New', 8, True, False, False, False);</code></pre>
<p>Then you have to search the area for your font.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//IsTextInAreaEx(x1,y1,x2,y2,returnX,returnYstring to find, leave this, font you declared,change this if it doesnt work,check edges, colour(-1 is any colour))
IsTextInAreaEx(0, 0, resX, resY, x, y, 'omgzwtfbbq!', 0, UpgradeFont, False, False, 0, 0, 15921906)</code></pre>
<p>Depending on the background the text is on and the colour of the text its normaly best to specify the colour of the text and use the values above. If your text is bold then you will have to change the two boolean values until you manage to get it working but the whole thing is rather fidly really until you get the right match.</p>
