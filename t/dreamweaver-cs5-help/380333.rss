    <description>edit: nvm idk wtf the problem is i cant even connect via sftp. wtf? i think theres something wrong with dreamweaver. i can connect perfectly to the ftp via windows explorer... this is very upsetting.






i didnt think putting this in general programming would be the appropriate place to place this. ok now the question.

I need help uploading my local site files to my web server. i have been successful using expression web 4. but i am having trouble putting in the same info(url and port, username, pass, transfer protocol, etc). i am using webdav, i had no problem in expression web, except that i had to create a public_html folder and place all my work in it to have it upload to the correct place. i guess i could use ftp but webdav seems more simple.

thx for the help.</description>
