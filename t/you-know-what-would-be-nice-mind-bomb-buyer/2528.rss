    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/you-know-what-would-be-nice-mind-bomb-buyer/2528</link>
    <description>A script that starts in fally west bank, walks to the beer place, talks to kaylee, buys 27 beers then banks them and goes again.

That would be great :)

Anyone who makes it will be greatly appreciated :)</description>
