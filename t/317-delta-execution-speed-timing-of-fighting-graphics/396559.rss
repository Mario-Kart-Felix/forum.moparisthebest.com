    <title>[317] [delta] execution speed/ timing of fighting graphics</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-execution-speed-timing-of-fighting-graphics/396559</link>
    <description>would anyone know how to alter the timing or speed of the graphics during combat without affecting actual hit speed in a delta 317 server?
what i mean by this currently:

someone attacks with dh axe. 
the graphics for the attack instantly execute (axe swings back and chops down)
 in approx 0.5 secs and
 simultaneously the hit (53) is displayed as graphics begin.

what i would like:
someone attacks with a dh axe.
 the graphics for the attack execute instantly ( (axe slowly swings back and chops down slowly aswell)
 in approx 1 second (rather than 0.5 - speed aspect)
Following the completion of the 1 sec long axe hit the hit (53) is displayed as graphics conclude - timing aspect

- actual hit speed is not altered as dh axe hits roughly every 2-3 secs, only difference is axe swings slower, and begins to swing prior to displayed hit rather than simultaneously

would i need to edit cache? for actual weapon hit speeds i know how to edit them in client.java this is more of a graphical concern

EDIT: not sure if this is a client sided/ server sided issue</description>
