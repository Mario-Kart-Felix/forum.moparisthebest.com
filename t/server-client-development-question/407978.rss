    <title>Server/Client Development Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-client-development-question/407978</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m sorry if the title of this post is ambiguous, but I just didn&#39;t know how to sum up my question in one line. I was lucky to get my hands on a 614 server/client a couple months ago, but I haven&#39;t seen much development beyond 614 to this date. I know several servers have incorporated new items, NPCs, interfaces and objects, but I haven&#39;t seen any NEW clients (614+). Why is that? I know that&#39;s very general, but I just always wondered what factor determined when a new RSPS release would occur.. Is there not enough desire out there, or has it become too hard to decompile the source code? Thanks :).

              <p>Yeah I’ve tried JAD, it gives a bunch of errors as well… Oh well, I guess I’ll just finish up my own decompiler and cross my fingers… and toes… and other appendages. Thanks for the help though  :).</p>

              <p>I use JAD, which works fine for me. Oh, also, you should have a quick look over these:<br>

<p>They are the clients from 555+ (currently up to 610). There is the classes, and the source for them all.</p>

              <p>Thanks, that answered my question perfectly… I just like using the newer clients since they have full support for HD graphics, which is a big plus for any RSPS. I have just one question, though… You stated that there’s no problem decompiling the client directly from RuneScape’s site. I’ve tried at least 5 or 6 Java decompilers, and each one does a poor job at decompiling the client. They produce at least 1000+ compilation errors in the “decompiled” code, which angers me greatly  :mad:. What decompilation software do most people use, since I just haven’t found a good one? I’ve become so frustrated that I’m 90% done coding my own Java decompiler that produces less errors than the professional ones  :|.</p>

              <p>There’s no problem decompiling the source code, or even getting the client. The older revisions are used much more often due to them being easier to use, as well as being documented better (rswiki).</p>
<p>Not many people incorporate new clients due to the fact that they can use their already developed 317 client and server, and all they have to do is update / load the newer client revisions cache.</p>
<p>Was that what you meant?</p>
