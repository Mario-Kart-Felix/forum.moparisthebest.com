    <description>[size=24pt]Project 317[/size]

[b]Project introduction[/b]

This is one of my latest projects which I’m creating, Project 317. It’s named Project 317 purely because of the fact that my server is based on the client revision 317. I’ve decided to create a development team because most servers which I’ve worked on in the past have become to much work for one person or just bore me out of working on it. That’s why I need more developers. My current ambition is to create a nice, unique, environmentally-friendly server which will be attractive to private-server gamers.

[b]Brief summary of my history with RSPS[/b]

My previous history with RSPS is quite successful; I’ve hosted several private servers before all achieving at least 5 players on at a time. My worst server I created was Revolution and was very unpopular due to the fact that it lacked a lot of required content and my most successful server which I’ve ever created was a Dodian remake (VividGamers) which averaged with around 20-30 people online at a time.

These are all valid reasons of why I’m looking for a development team to work with me. I can’t do it alone.

All server hosting and webhosting are sorted out, there is no need to worry about this factor.

[b]Current Team:[/b]

Lead Programmers 
-	Luke
-	baddy351 (trial)
Lead programmers will program everything within the server from skills to new areas. Please be aware that to get accepted into the lead programmer position you’ll need a nifty application.
Website Developers
-	Position open
-	Position open
Website developers are required to have experience with both PHP and mySQL to get accepted.
Content ideas
-	Position open
-	Position open
-	Position open
Content is a huge factor in any RSPS that’s why I’ve decided to add another position especially for this. I hope that the ideas which are shared are appropriate and are fortunate enough to be accepted. This is one reason why you need an appropriate English skill to be accepted.

[b]Team requirements[/b]

Also to ensure that you’re not some child I’m also setting a requirement on the entry to get a position in the development team.

You need to have at least 2 years of programming experience in Java; other programming language experience aren’t required but will enhance your chances of your application getting accepted.

You need to have a minimum of 100 forum posts to reduce the chance of you being an impersonator and only pretending to want to be a part of the development team so that you can plagiarise our work. 

You need to be able to speak clear, fluent and understandable English otherwise you’ll definitely not be getting accepted. This requirement is very important; I don’t want to be talking to a simpleton who doesn’t understand what I or someone on my development team is saying. 

Also and remember if I don’t think you’re fit for the job you will be demoted from your position or if I think you’re not fit prior to the acceptance of your application your application will be denied. 

[b]Application Format:[/b]
[i]
Detailed Application Form[/i]

[code]Name (Or something which you want to be addressed by [And no lol I won’t be addressing you with “master” or “your majesty”]): 
Age (Minimum age requirement: 15 [Maturity factor]):
Email (MSN, Skype, etc [Preferably MSN]):
Position (Which position to you want and why):
Previous experience (All programming languages you’re experience with [I don’t want to know that you’ve programmed a hello world application in C, I only want to know what programming languages you have knowledge of]):
Evidence (Images are best and evidence that they’re your work):[/code]

[i]Blank Application Form[/i]

[code]Name:
Age:
Email:
Position:
Previous Experience:[/code]

In conclusion simply established that this project will not fail if I get a decent development team which reaches all of my requirements and our server will become very unique and popular.</description>

<p>You’re exactly right, I might have to limit access to the source; only show the necessary files and don’t include critical components of the server which are required for the server to execute properly. Alternatively I could write a plugin system which scripts can interface and not allow any access to the source - I might look further into this option.</p>
