    <description>ugh ok so i have an issue with ints,

so im not sure what type of ints my client has but heres an example
[code=java]		case 13887:
			itemDef.name = &quot;Vesta&#39;s chainbody&quot;;
			itemDef.actions = new String[5];
			itemDef.actions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
			itemDef.modelID = 42593;
			itemDef.modelZoom = 1440;
			itemDef.modelRotation1 = 545;
			itemDef.modelRotation2 = 2;
			itemDef.modelOffset2 = 5;
			itemDef.modelOffset1 = 4;
			itemDef.anInt204 = 0;
			itemDef.maleEquip1 = 42624;
			itemDef.femaleEquip1 = 42644;
			itemDef.description = &quot;Vesta&#39;s chainbody.&quot;.getBytes();
			break;
[/code]

i was just wondering how i would convert these ints to work on my client?
if someone could help me out by reposting it converted or giving me a converion chart of which is which that&#39;d be great
