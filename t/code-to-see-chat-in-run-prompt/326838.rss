    <title>Code To See Chat in Run Prompt?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/code-to-see-chat-in-run-prompt/326838</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen this done before... But i can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do it. What I&#39;m talking about is where a player in your server might type &quot;hi&quot; in the chat  and then enter it. I want to be able to see what they said in my run prompt. 
Here&#39;s an example of a code that shows of in the prompt because of what a player had done. 
[code]}

	public void println_debug(String str, int ID, String Name) {
		System.out.println(&quot;[client-&quot; + ID + &quot;-&quot; + Name + &quot;]: &quot; + str);
	}[/code]

Any ideas how to make it show what they typed in the chat? 
Thank you
