    <title>07Scape and it&#39;s effect on private servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/07scape-and-its-effect-on-private-servers/493783</link>
    <description>As the founder of a well-known rsps community, I would like to ask people here what they think of 07Scape and what effect it will have, if any, on private servers.

1. The magic circle
I personally feel RuneScape (current version) has became very complicated with all the new features jam-packed into a browser based game, but the old-school version brought back memories for me and I genuinely felt back in the &#39;magic circle&#39; of gaming.

2. Customization and fun aspect
Private servers will always have the fun aspect that runescape wouldn&#39;t, for example, anything goes on a private server and players are allowed to play casually whilst still having fun on the real game.

3. 317 server development improves and gains inspiration

For me, 07scape means private servers will become more [i]casually[/i] played, not not by much less.</description>

About 90 people when I post this. I don’t see 07 staying strong for long. It will never ‘die’ but people don’t like working hard for their items, and in the 07 era it wasn’t exactly easy. Private Servers always offer fast and easy ways to play.</p>

<p>I agree most with this comment. Although I really like the way the newer revision has the cache server sided? If someone could do this to the 317 revision it would be ideal. Many people exit webclients before the cache downloads.<br>

<p>There are 317 servers that cache is read server-sided. RuneRebels reads a lot of things through the actual 377 cache. But you will always need to download it to play it on the players end.[/quote]Not necessarily. With all things loaded through the “on demand fetcher”, you could easily send over the data right when it’s needed. It would be a costly feature server-wise, but players wouldn’t have to download the entire cache.</p>

Then remakes for the higher revisions would start because people miss some of the content of the 2008 and 2009 era, etc…</p>
