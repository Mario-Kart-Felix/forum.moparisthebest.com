    <description>Hello I&#39;ve been working on a Devolution based server for a couple weeks now and I just wanted to share with you what I have accomplished and what are my future hopes for the server.  Keep in mind that this is my first server I have coded, but i have coded other servers like Figmentscape just for practice. Well lets take a look
What I have done so far:
Started making Lost City and Dragon Slayer quest
I&#39;m using a few amount of commands (less junk the better)
Thinking about making small Treasure Trail
Added Vengeance with real skull
A portal room
Working on Godwars (almost finished)
Working on small summoning (just basic use the pouch, it summons monster, you gain experience and you have to have a certain summon level to summon monsters.
Working on Low and High level assault minigames (almost finished)
My custom Partyhat Minigame
Improved Npc and player dialogues
Cleaned up a bit and removed unneccisary junk
Fixed attacking npc problem with Devolution 7.0
Added a Gnome Glider system
Working on a RS-like barrows
Removed starter (you recieve a bronze sword, wooden shield and guide book on first login)
Removed Premium member
Working on new training area (havent started yet)
Added a small skill menu for combat skills
Working on Mage Training area

Progress With Client:
Added Vengeance skull
Added multiway frame
Added Bronze to Dragon defenders
Added some summoning monsters
Put logout door in upper right hand corner (still need to add sprite)
Added Bandos and Saradomin Godwars General
Added some summoning pouches (thanks to SilentCJ)
Added bunch of new items and Npcs
Attempting to add the new options, lunar and Emote interface (once I figure out to do the tutorial - i&#39;m not really experienced with clients)
Added Halo Vehicles (thanks to Cocoa)
Added Warrior Guild Animator and Animated armours (again thanks to Cocoa)
And more to come

Now keep in mind I&#39;m not that experienced with coding so please don&#39;t flame.  Thanks for viewing.  
Oh and on a side note could anyone explain how to add new interfaces to a Client?  I don&#39;t really understand Meanz interface tutorial on R.U.N.E ~ S.E.R.V.E.R. Thanks</description>
