    <title>Signpost Help on Delta Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/signpost-help-on-delta-source/258256</link>
    <description>Hello I recently made a portal room on my Delta Based Source and I need a signpost to tell the different portals. I would like one sign that can tell me like, right to left, lumby, fally, ect. I have the signpost placed already, I just need to know how to make an interface come up with the text of my choice on it. I really need to know how to do this. My email is Cruz_Luck@hotmail.com I can speak over msn if you want but please post on here first so I know to look for you. I will be gone for the rest of the day so hopefully you can just post how to do it on this topic. Thanks for you help!
