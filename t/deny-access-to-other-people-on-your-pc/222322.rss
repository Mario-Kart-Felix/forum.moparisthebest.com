    <title>Deny access to other people on your PC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deny-access-to-other-people-on-your-pc/222322</link>
    <description>This is a script that won&#39;t let people go on your computer.

When someone tries to get on your computer after you&#39;ve hibernated it, it will just let them get to the desktop, and then it will hibernate/put your computer into stand by, what ever script you choose.

To use, set the co-ordinates that you need to (they are explained in the script), minimize SCAR (Ctrl+M), start SCAR when you would normally turn your computer off with Ctrl+Alt+R (not play button because SCAR is minimized). When someone tries to use your PC, they will be denied access.

The only way people would be able to bypass this would be if they were to turn your PC by the mains switch, or turn it off when it is loading from hibernation. The other way would be if they knew how to stop SCAR, but I am the only person in my family that does.


Please post any comments or bugs that you may find.

If you do not have hibernation enabled, and don&#39;t know how to enable it, read this:

Press Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Power Options &gt; Hibernate &gt; Enable Hibernation &gt; OK</description>
