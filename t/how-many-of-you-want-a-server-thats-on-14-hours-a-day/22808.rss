    <description>Well Me,Baracuda are planning on doing so, We need to port forward make another server called *********(The name will be released when made.This is so nobody will take it like they did on Xscape).
Were gonna get the codes put in. These include:
Monsters on Ellis Island(And abanded Island we found)
  These are the following monsters there:
    1.Lesser Demons
    2.Baby Blue Dargon
    3.Black Dragon
 The other abanded Island:
    1.King Black Dragon(X50 X50)
That&#39;s all for the Island and monsters.
Now for the new added Items.
we use item edit for this.(SO far we cant put in the pics)
1.Full Dragon.
2.Full Diamend Diamend B-axe, Diamend Scimmy, Diamend Whip, Diamend Great axe, Diamend White Party Hat!!!!!!
3.Full barrows edit:With Diamend Great Axe And Diamend Armour(Note:You can Get  barrows at reg. Price but with diamend the price gos higher.We have a Diamend armour and weapon store if ya wanna know)
4.Full Rune(Sara,Guth,Zammy etc. We dont have the reg. rune armour)
5.Full Addy(Addy T,Addy G, Etc.)
6.Green Dhide(Dhide (G) etc.)
7.The First Black Dhide (G)
8.The First Blue dhide (W)
  Thats it so far with the Items 
Now for the commands!
::commandmenu-To get you started off
::God-Gives you all god armours
::RangeArmour-Gives You the Black Dhide (G) And Blue Dhide (G) etc.
::Addy-Gives you all addy (G) etc.
So far thats all I have added. Baracuda. I didn&#39;t tell you this. LOL
For the Stats,I will change youre stats if wanted to, If youre lazy to get up high. Ill give you free stuff. Drop partys alaways happen every 30 secs in the bank. It is cover in money.(5mil in each Sq. Box =) )
Its almost 25% Done
This is gonna be About 15% Laggy About for 15 secs Estimated and then you will be lag free, Remember we have to reboot the server every 1hr! Longer then I anticipated For it to-be.
Go [url=http://freewebs.com/baracuda95]HERE[/url] For our other server that was up until baracudas Java got Screwed up But until then Thanks!
Note:I didn&#39;t Post this in the server advertisement becuase it wasn&#39;t done so I cant post it if it wasn&#39;t done.[br][size=1]Posted at: November 06, 2006, 03:42:45 PM[/size][hr]ANyone Want This Server?</description>
