    <description>MOL stands for My Own Language, created by me :D And it is based off no other scripting language and it is extremely easy to script once you get the grasp of it :p. I had created this in Delphi, and i will be adding to it. Right now, i only have about 3 working functions. Read the tutorial for more information (included with MOL) ;)
