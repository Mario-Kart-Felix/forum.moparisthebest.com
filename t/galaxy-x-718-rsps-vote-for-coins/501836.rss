To start out with this update, I would like to just say sorry for the amount of time since the last update.

With this update me and Gir sat down and thought what we would want to accomplish from all of the suggestions and the results of the voting from the [url=http://&quot;http://galaxyxscape.org/forums/index.php?/topic/578-suggestions/&quot;]Suggestions[/url] thread.  What we have come up with is that there will not be just one major update, and it will be eased in a little bit at each update.

We have decided to choose Varrock as are main city.  
Varrock will be the home area for now on:

Some of the object and npcs that used to be at home have been moved also.

The PKing, Pure, and Potion shops have been moved to Edgeville.

The Altar of Zaos is in the Varrock Church on the second level, and the usual altar is in the church on the main floor. All the other shop NPCs are in their correct spots.  Bob is in Lumbridge, in his shop.

Gir has been working on a Minigame that deals with Hunter.  To play talk to the Hunting Expert at the Hunter teleport.  You need atleast 43 Hunter and can not be wielding a weapon or a shield.

Another update that Gir worked on was Gambling.  You are able to gamble away from 10k-10m gp at the most.

Two brand-new Bosses have been added, but are currently still in BETA.  Me and Gir are looking for possible drops for the two bosses.

The command to claim votes has been changed to ::claim from ::votes.

Clicking on the players online where the Report Abuse is normally located will open up the players online list.  The list has been lengthened to be able to show a max of 300 players.

Thieving has been moved from home and a teleport has been added the the skilling teleport dialogue.

Like I said above this update is one of many to come in the future that will be moving this community closer to the full world usage.  In this update we are introducing the full usage of the Loadstone Network.  As a default, the Varrock loadstone is activated due to the home being at varrock.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/DVu8iga.png[/img]

The second Update of many to give the full world usage is Tormented Demons.  To get to Tormented Demons threw the basement of the Lumbridge Kitchen then threw the hole in the wall. Also a bank chest has been placed in the basement.

The next update is for voting once you have voted by doing ::vote  claim your reward by doing claim

As well as donators can now chose there title and design it as they wish! They can make up there own name, own color own shadow and if they would like the name before or after there original name!
