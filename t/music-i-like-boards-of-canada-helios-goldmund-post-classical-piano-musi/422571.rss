    <title>Music I like Boards of canada =&gt; Helios =&gt; Goldmund =&gt; post-classical piano musi</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/music-i-like-boards-of-canada-helios-goldmund-post-classical-piano-musi/422571</link>
    <description>Somebody on irc (Think it was SPPT) linked me to boards of canada and I fell in love with their music. My housemate heard and said I&#39;d probably like Helios. I love them as well now. The composer(helios) also releases music under another name called goldmund.

It&#39;s sort of post-classical piano music and my main reason posting here was to see if anyone knows any similar music.

KeithKenniff (composer of Helios and Goldmund) has this soundcloud account and he has so much stuff on there that I love.</description>

              <p>If you like Boards of Canada try Aphex Twin.<br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="uUmNmpGnKp4" data-youtube-title="Aphex Twin - Come to Daddy (HD 720p)" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>There music varies; try other songs too.</p>
