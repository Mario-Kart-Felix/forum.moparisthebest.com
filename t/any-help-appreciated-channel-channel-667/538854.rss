    <description>ANY HELP AT ALL IS APPRECIATED!

Hello guys trying to make it so my server will init a player, I got that, but now when creating a new session as such:

[code]Session session = new Session(Channel channel);[/code]

How do I get that Channel? I have a null in there now, when i try to log in, it just logs me right out, and in the command prompt it says because of Nullpointerexception, I believe this is why. 
Where do I get a channel? or how do I turn a String into a Channel?


------------------------------------EDIT------------------------------------
It&#39;s package is:  org.jboss.netty.channel
I guess I just don&#39;t know what a Channel is?
I know it&#39;s what connects them to the server, but idk how to initialize one...</description>
