    <title>Chessy018 hacked</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chessy018-hacked/386802</link>
    <description>Specifically, recovered. Which happens to be my favorite form of &#39;hacking&#39;, being that it requires help from the Jagex crew themselves :)

The guy that recovered it worked off information he got from an account his friend recovered(N0valyfe, yeah, the n0valyfe), who had Chessy018 added and social engineered some people on his friends list into divulging her facebook/myspace and other personal details. 

Every account Chessy018 traded with over the past few days is locked, including ones that didn&#39;t receive any items(which I find extremely funny). Sly(the recoverer) got his account unlocked within the past hour with over 120b on it, the rest is on smaller mules

The total bank value is worth around 170b with street prices and whatnot

<p>Can you provide proof for this? And I know they temp give IP restriction for 5 mins if you have too many failed attempts which is why the “This IP address is disabled” message comes.</p>

<p>He has, somewhere he said that his old account “wasn’t secure” or something. He had a bank pin and didn’t lose anything that wasn’t banked, but he still got recovered.</p>

Unauthorised access to online accounts whether it is your bank account or your RuneScape account is a criminal offence, it is illegal in the UK under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, and the USA’s Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 1986 as well as equivalent legislation in many other countries around the world. Jagex have already successfully pursued a RuneScape hijacker in the UK using the above law. You can read about it on the BBC news website.</p>
<p>We want to send a clear message that hijacking is not clever and will not do you any favours, it is an illegal act and we regularly send information onto local law enforcement agencies.<br>
[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>Anyway, good to see Jagex sticking by their guns.</p>
