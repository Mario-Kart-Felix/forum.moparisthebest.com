              <p>before you even attepmt the click option, you might want to attempt:<br>
[+] Code in your own boolean for the death of a duealing player:<br>
[+] A Methed for rules<br>
[+] Staking metheds</p>
<p>and some more things i cant think of the top of my head. try those first, BUT for the boolean for death, try looking at public boolean applydead, and learn how they work.</p>
