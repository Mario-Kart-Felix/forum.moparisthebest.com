    <title>Looking for Tutor</title>

    <description>I don&#39;t expect to get one within 10 seconds, just so you know.

I&#39;m looking for a tutor that can teach me the more advanced and yet some basic coding. The last one didn&#39;t work out to well, an uptight racist 12 year old, Chemical kid.

Quotes from Msn:

Chemical kid: haha you have 15 people on and i have 200 thats sad
Me: Sorry, no offence but you sound a bit like a toser.
Chemical kid: haha you a tosser
Me: haha get your priorities right, your not a higher being, your server isn&#39;t any better than mine becuase yous has 180 people more.
Chemical kid: YOUR JELOUS
Chemical kid: Fat jew.

I found all that quite funny to be honest.

anyways. If you think your up for it, i&#39;m a quick learner. I know some basics.

Pm me or post!

thanks
