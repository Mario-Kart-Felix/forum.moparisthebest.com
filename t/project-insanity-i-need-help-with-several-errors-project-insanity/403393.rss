    <description>I need help, I&#39;ve helped some people but never ever receive help back. I really want to start coding my server tonight for something to do and some,thing to look forward to. I&#39;m getting a client error and I&#39;ve posted it in Client help about 3 times and no one has helped so I&#39;m posting here. [b]I know this is the wrong section[/b] so don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s the wrong section. I need someone to tell me a good [b]Project Insanity Base[/b] so i can work off. I&#39;ve got a good one and I&#39;ve started to code it a tiny bit but I&#39;ve got a really weird feeling that it isn&#39;t going to work with the client. Even though it&#39;s the origonal Project Insanity posted by Sanity off google. It should work but I need help with this Client issue and Server Issue.
