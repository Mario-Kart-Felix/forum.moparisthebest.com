    <description>I&#39;ve searched for a similar topic, found 1, but the people who answered misunderstood what the person was asking, so I will try to clear up what I&#39;m about to ask:
I have downloaded a client, Demise PK&#39;ing client. I&#39;m no expert to mopar and its been a while since I&#39;ve been on here. Now, my source runs and compiles fine, as well as this client. I can log on just fine, but the problem is it ONLY uses localhost to sign on. My friend has the same source and client and we can&#39;t figure out how to adjust what ip it uses to connect to. (There is no &quot;File&quot; option to click on at the top left, or &quot;ip&quot; option under username and password, I simply can&#39;t find it.) This has happened on 2 other clients as well. I may be behind on the times... but can someone help?</description>
