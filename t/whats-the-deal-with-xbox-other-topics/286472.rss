    <description>Ohlo.
I&#39;ve had an xbox 360 well, Since around when they came out. And in that time period mine has only broken down once.
Mainly because my dad is an idiot and bought it used. We got RROD. So we sent it in to microsoft. Turns out that the previous 
owners benq flashed the drive but they did it horribly. So I was stuck with one solution. Fixing it. I successfully re-Flashed it, Sold it on ebay then more then we bought it for. And had enough to buy a brand new xbox. I bought a new xbox because Flashed drives usually get banned when not professionally done. So what&#39;s the big deal with everyone else? I don&#39;t see why xbox is that bad. Mine runs like 13-24 hours a day (I usually get into a Nazi zombies glitch in hopes to get high up on the leaderboards.) and it hasn&#39;t overheated once. Now, Ps3 owners. Don&#39;t come here and brag about how you get free PSN. Because I don&#39;t care. That&#39;s pretty much the only downside of xbox live. Also, I don&#39;t care that Ps3&#39;s have a blue ray player.. I still fucking watch digital, I don&#39;t care about HD. HD can get fucked in the ass with a cactus. 
I&#39;d like to know, What are your thoughts on the Xbox 360?

On to my second topic: Modding.
If you do own an Xbox 360, Do you mod it?
I can tell you that I do, I&#39;ve been hex editing COD5 since it came out.
Thing&#39;s I have recently accomplished 
Successfully bypassed the COD5 patch.
I&#39;ve made a short tutorial right here if anyone wants it.
[code]
You Need:
Colasoft Packet Builder (CPB)
Wireshark

1.Start up your xbox 360 and log in to XBL

2.Set up your 360 so it connects to your Ethernet adapter with ICS 

3.Using Wireshark start capturing on your Ethernet adapter.
Once the capture has started Run COD5, go into a game and play that match,
when it ends and your back to your party on your own stop the capture dont stop it until
it looks like no more packets are being captured in Wireshark.
Stop the capture and save your capture as test.cap (make sure its .cap).

4.Once thats done quit the game so you are back to the XMB.

5.Delete the game patch XXLBRBXX (oN MEMORY UNIT OR HDD TAB )

6.Copy your modified profile to the 360 ( Ie modded with no lcip/God mode that kinda stuff )

7.Go back to your laptop/pc and open up test.cap in Colasoft Packet Builder.

8.Click on the Send All button located in the toolbar.



Follow this carefully


#Tick &quot;Burst Mode&quot;

#Tick &quot;Loop Sending&quot;

#Reduce the loops from 1 to 0 for infinate loop

#Set Delay Between Loops to the number of packets you have captured

So if you have captured 411 packets then it should be set to 411 milliseconds 
(see problems at bottom) The lower the number the higher the chances

#Make sure you are still signed in, if not sign in before running the game again.

#Click on &quot;Start&quot; in Colasoft PB IMMEDIATLY. Now run the game.
This should bypass the &quot;Patch update Request&quot; message after the Call of Duty Logo dissapears.
Dont panic if the logo takes longer than usual to disappear, 
but if its there for more than 2 minutes restart the 360 by the console and not the
controller (Make those adjustments to the Delay Between Loops value in CPB).
Run the whole game through to Multiplayer&gt;Play Online and with 
luck you should be able to join in an online match with the hacks





Problems:
Its a 50/50 battle between not flooding the 360 with packets causing the connection to fail
resulting in you having to sign in again. 
Colasoft not sending the right packet quickly enough resulting in the update request message
appearing. Press the Guide button on the controller, 
Quit Game and start again but always make sure you are signed in.
You will just need to mess around with the &quot;Delay Between Loops&quot; value until you get it
right. If you do you will be online with the hacks working.


WARNING: Don&#39;t set the Delay between loops too low like &quot;0&quot; for example.
It will crash your 360 and you will have to restart it using the power off button on the 360
itself and not the controller. And no, it doesnt damage it 


The Delay Between Loops instruction I gave you is what worked best for me but it
doesn&#39;t matter what value it is aslong as its roughly between the 50-50 problem above.
Just mess around with it and see what you can find.
It took me so many attempts to get it right so it isn&#39;t a decent method but it could 
be beneficial to look into it and you never know it could be the begining of something.[/code]
Successfully blocked out the Update packet without having to do the above ^.
Manually Hexed DVARS into the Cod5 savegame using my own method.
(Dvars are raw command strings used by the game. Example: C spawnsystem_friend_influencer_stacking &quot;VALUE&quot;. If you want it to take any action, The value will most likely be 1+)
My DVAR hexing way:
Search FF FF FF FF FF FF FF As a hex value. In ASCII it would come up as &quot;.....ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ&quot;
Before the .... Goes your DVAR string.
But you can&#39;t place it as just anything. You have to replace the Spaces with underscores. And put Four dots before the string, and four dots after the string (Before the value) Example:
[code]
....C_spawnsystem_friend_influencer_stacking....1[/code]
Now, In hex. A period is usually put as &quot;2e&quot; Change the first three dots to &quot;00&quot;, The last dot Is the sum of letters in the string (Not including the value) So lets count, 40. 40 in hex would be 28 (http://ascii.cl/conversion.htm)
Here&#39;s what the start of our hex line should look like..
[code]00 00 00 28 43 5F 73 70 61 77 6E 73 79 73 74 65 6D 5F 66 72 69 65 6E 64 5F 69 6E 66 6C 75 65 6E 63 65 72 5F 73 74 61 63 6B 69 6E 67 00 00 00 2e 31[/code]Now, The last 2e should be the sum of numbers in the value. In this case it would be one, one is 01. So change the last 2e to 01. It is 01 because when your editing hex, It has to be two characters. If it&#39;s only one you usually put a zero before or after the Letter/Number.
Save &amp; quit. Resign and Rehash.
Most of you don&#39;t really care. But for you that do. I hope I taught you something.
So moparscape,
I&#39;d like to know, If you own a 360, Do you mod? If so, Share some knowledge with me.
You can teach me something and I could teach you something aswell.
Also, Whats your gamertag? Heres mine..

<p>The Delay Between Loops instruction I gave you is what worked best for me but it<br>
doesn’t matter what value it is aslong as its roughly between the 50-50 problem above.<br>
Just mess around with it and see what you can find.<br>
It took me so many attempts to get it right so it isn’t a decent method but it could<br>
be beneficial to look into it and you never know it could be the begining of something.[/code]<br>
Successfully blocked out the Update packet without having to do the above ^.<br>
Manually Hexed DVARS into the Cod5 savegame using my own method.<br>
(Dvars are raw command strings used by the game. Example: C spawnsystem_friend_influencer_stacking “VALUE”. If you want it to take any action, The value will most likely be 1+)<br>
My DVAR hexing way:<br>
Search FF FF FF FF FF FF FF As a hex value. In ASCII it would come up as “…ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ”<br>
Before the … Goes your DVAR string.<br>
But you can’t place it as just anything. You have to replace the Spaces with underscores. And put Four dots before the string, and four dots after the string (Before the value) Example:</p>
<p><code>
....C_spawnsystem_friend_influencer_stacking....1</code><br>
Now, In hex. A period is usually put as “2e” Change the first three dots to “00”, The last dot Is the sum of letters in the string (Not including the value) So lets count, 40. 40 in hex would be 28 (<a href="http://ascii.cl/conversion.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ascii.cl/conversion.htm</a>)<br>
Here’s what the start of our hex line should look like…</p>
<p><code>00 00 00 28 43 5F 73 70 61 77 6E 73 79 73 74 65 6D 5F 66 72 69 65 6E 64 5F 69 6E 66 6C 75 65 6E 63 65 72 5F 73 74 61 63 6B 69 6E 67 00 00 00 2e 31</code>Now, The last 2e should be the sum of numbers in the value. In this case it would be one, one is 01. So change the last 2e to 01. It is 01 because when your editing hex, It has to be two characters. If it’s only one you usually put a zero before or after the Letter/Number.<br>
Save &amp; quit. Resign and Rehash.<br>
Most of you don’t really care. But for you that do. I hope I taught you something.<br>
