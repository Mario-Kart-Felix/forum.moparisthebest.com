    <title>An auto fighter plus item collector and bank, monk healer and arrow collector</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-auto-fighter-plus-item-collector-and-bank-monk-healer-and-arrow-collector/131323</link>
    <description>basically the title says it all, i have no idea how to code anything at the moment, altho hopefully i will learn soon.

i was thinking of this for a pure, but it could work for all.

a good spot to train pures is the monks, because they dont hit very high, they heal themselves during combat, and they can heal u if u talk 2 them. they are west of edgeville in the monestary if ur looking for them

another idea is an autofigher that collects cow hides and banks, and u can set it so that if you havent done price ali quest you can walk around, then you can bank the hides.

the arrow collector is simple, just after fighting pick up the arrows...atleast it sounds simple

it would b great if these had anti-ban and detect randoms

thanks for looking</description>
