    <title>Is there maybe still a way i can portforward?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-there-maybe-still-a-way-i-can-portforward/337104</link>
    <description>Well, first a question. Do i really need to make a static ip to portforward, isn&#39;t there any other way? And now my problem: Well, i can&#39;t go to 192.168.2.1 because im using a router so i need a hardwire cable. I don&#39;t got that one. So i can&#39;t do it manually. uTorrent didn&#39;t work too..... What now.....?</description>
