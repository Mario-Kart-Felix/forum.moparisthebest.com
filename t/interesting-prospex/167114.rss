[0341.48] &lt;Kamu&gt; Labyrinthitis is a balance disorder. It is an inflammatory process affecting the labyrinths that house the vestibular system (which sense changes in head position) of the inner ear.
[0341.51] &lt;Kamu&gt; seems
[0341.54] &lt;Mopman&gt; makes u awful awful dizzy
[0341.55] &lt;Kamu&gt; that
[0342.01] &lt;whitecastle_&gt; wikipedia has an entry
[0342.01] &lt;Mopman&gt; i layed on my kitchen floor for 2 hours yesterday
[0342.02] &lt;whitecastle_&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinthitis

[0342.35] &lt;Kamu&gt; Recovery from acute labyrinthine inflammation generally takes from one to six weeks; however, it is not uncommon for residual symptoms (dysequilibrium and/or dizziness) to last for many months or even years (Bronstein, 2002) if permanent damage occurs.
