To fix the tools.jar issue you can go to your Jre6/lib/ and there should be a tools.jar located in there. Now copy over your tools.jar to your Jdk6/lib/. Once you’re finished doing that, compile and you should be set to go with it not failing this time.</p>

<p>I don’t use JDK 6. I figured OP was probably using it.</p>
