    <title>[PI] Designate Objects to Certain Heights</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-designate-objects-to-certain-heights/414377</link>
    <description>How would i exactly do this? As far as I know, I have tried to go through all of ObjectManager.java, ObjectHandler.java and Client.java to add the height int, but it just dosen&#39;t seem to work. When I place an object it is set to all the heights for the one coordinate. How would I make it set to the designated height?</description>
