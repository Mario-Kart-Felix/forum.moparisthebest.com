    <title>Suggestions for Network Storage (NAS)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestions-for-network-storage-nas/401721</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking to buy a Network Storage (NAS) solution within the next few weeks. Perhaps a custom-built? I am now finding internal hard drives for [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136847]very, very cheap[/url] these days and I&#39;d love to have access to such quantities of space. I was thinking about buying a small hard drive bay and then attaching some cheap hard drives to it. I&#39;m not sure how this all works though, I&#39;d have to do some research first...

If you have a NAS, what is your setup?</description>
