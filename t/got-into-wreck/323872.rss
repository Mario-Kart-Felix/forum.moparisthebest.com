    <title>Got into wreck</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/got-into-wreck/323872</link>
    <description>Well, December 18th I got checked out of school as it was the last day before a big holiday and this is common at my school. When I got home my mom wanted me to go run some movies back to Block Buster.. So I did.

I arrived at Block Buster and dropped off the movies. I had $10 and was feeling quite hungry as I didn&#39;t eat lunch at school yet. I didn&#39;t know where I was going to eat.. My final decision was Wendy&#39;s...

I got my meal at Wendy&#39;s and proceeded to leave, where the Wendy&#39;s, Krystal&#39;s (Like White Castle), Mcdonald&#39;s is a very bad road because cars fly up and down it and theres a big hill you can&#39;t see over.

When I went to take a left turn traffic was completely clear (I was sitting there for 10 minutes waiting for it to clear). I look one more time and pull out in the first lane I was tboned by a Big F150 truck (I was driving a small car) knocked unconscious and thrown through 7 lanes of traffic into a ditch on the other side.  

My dad is a firefighter for that City (they do there shifts like work 24 hours and have 48 hours off). He was paged on a call, when he got there he had to watch me being cut out with the life of jaws and shit (must have to suck for a parent). I came conscious somewhere during this part long enough to tell the firefighter my moms cell phone number (vaguely remember)

Long story short I was life flighted to the best trauma center in GA and spent 6 horrible days in the hospital. I&#39;m glad to say that I&#39;m almost completely recovered since then, But I still have to use a wheel chair to get around (sucks when you live in a house with stairs).

In this horrid wreck I broke my hip in 5 places and ripped a hole the size of a half dollar in my bladder. I came close to dying from internal bleeding and my blood pressure dropping so quick.. But it&#39;s all good.

I had 3 tubes in me that sucked, One up my penis, One in the side of my stomach to drain blood and urine when it ripped, and one up my nose going down into my stomach.

Oh and also I have a 8 inch scar up my stomach and a bunch of little holes from the 37 staples holding my skin together.

Here are some pictures...

[size=5pt]Also, I don&#39;t like asking.. But its worth a shot. My medical bills are extremely expensive.. and the wrecked was placed into my fault.. So if you have any extra money laying around I would greatly appreciate any donation.

<p>I started MMA ages ago you nub. 6-1 is my record, with the loss being a doctors decision due to a cut on my eye. I’ve won 2 by rear naked choke, 1 by flying armbar, 1 by Knock out, 1 by corner stoppage and the last one was my favorite when I won by a tap out after I threw him l0l</p>

All I’ve broken was like, 6 ribs, 4 ankles (here’s a hint, don’t try jumps because people on 250s can do them l0l), femur twice, forearm, 4 compressions on my neck, 5 vertebrates compressed together (T3, T4, T5, T6, T7), 3 fingers and 4 toes… the latter is from MMA lool. Rest are just from Motocross.</p>
