    <description>When you would trade with someone it wouldn&#39;t let you click on your items to trade. It was like your items were just a picture. You could right click them, but you could only examine them....... then once your trade was done (either you and the person accepted (nothing being traded), or you declined) there would be a blank screen. Looks like your stuff would be gone. Yet, if you trade a store a somethign then exit, it would be back to normal.... 


This is wierd, so you could please help me I&#39;d very much appreciate it!   =]</description>
