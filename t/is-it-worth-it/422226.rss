<p>Seriously, you couldn’t just google this or ask your FRIENDS about it? Come on man, why the fuck would you want strangers over the internet to manage your life…</p>

</aside>
<p>I dont see why you need to get all angry about this. Yes I did buy it. But I was asking compared to all the other games I could buy out there. Such as saint row 3, gears of war 3, MW3. I just wanted different views. Don’t get pissy about it. I also asked some of my friends, so why would asking for more feedback about the game be so bad? Don’t like the topic, you dont have to read it. It doesn’t effect you in any way shape or form. I dont mean to beat a dead horse, just curious is all.</p>

Something being useless would mean that you got absolutely nothing out of it, the point of video games is entertainment and if you don’t want to pay for it then frankly you don’t deserve it.

<p>I don’t see why he can’t make decisions for himself and is compelled to attention whore himself on these forums… This is obviously a “I’m totally gonna buy this game guys but first you all need to tell me how good it is even though I’ve been told 2000 times before kk thnx” thread.<br>
[/quote]<br>
He obviously wants different views on this game probably for different reasons as some people don’t come in to contact with people often as they may be home schooled or live under different circumstances as you aswell maybe they’d like to become a little bit more active on the forums and start up a little more chatter around here instead of posting pointless replies and making an ass out of there self.</p>
<p>On topic here, I think it’s well worth your money but from what I hear the FPS lowers gradually as memory is taken up on the game.[/quote]<br>
I second that.</p>

I’d even go to the movies instead of waiting for a DVDrip.</p>
<p>That if I had the money, but I don’t. Having the money for those purposes is the same to me as having too much money and not knowing where to spend it on. Like if I had JB’s 112 million dollars. Then I’d buy my games. I’d watch the movies in a movie theater (it’s not like I don’t ever go to the movies, I go about 2 - 3 times a year because of friends). I’d donate to charitable organizations. Took back what belongs to Armenia (from the Turks). And make more money. Sorry for this information as most of you won’t care but it’s 2AM and I’m bored.</p>
