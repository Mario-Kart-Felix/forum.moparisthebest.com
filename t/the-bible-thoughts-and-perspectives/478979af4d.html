        <p>I understand. And there is no possible way anyone can interpret the Bible 100% correctly. Most people and churches interpret the Bible to make them feel good. The Catholic Church for instance, isn’t even based on the Bible. Roman Catholics start with Dogma: the immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary, purgatory, prayers for the dead, the “real presence” of the Lord in the consecrated wafer, and even mass, the Catholic Church’s cornerstone, isn’t even in the Bible.</p>
<p>So how should we interpret the bible? We should look at it from different perspectives…</p>
<ol>
<li>Literally</li>
<li>Culturally</li>
<li>Grammatically</li>
</ol>
<p>Some look at it from a different view point. They look at it from an Allegorical viewpoint (covenant theology). They believe God does all things to manifest his grace. But this system contradicts the relationship of the Church and Israel. It doesn’t make an allowance for the millennial reign of Christ on the earth.</p>
<p>God did create a book for his followers to understand, but we are unable to fathom God’s mind. What we do know from gleening from the Scriptures is a small fraction of his knowledge but that small fraction is enough.</p>

<p>How was the Bible not properly written?[/quote]<br>
St. Peter was the first Pope, they believe that his authority is transfered to the next pope.<br>
This should give you some ideas why they think so:<br>

<p>“How was the Bible not properly written?”<br>
Because people can’t agree upon all its teachings.</p>

<p>Edit: Just took a couple minutes to check the first contradiction on the list. There was no contradiction… The verses referred to two different people. Adino the Eznite slew 800 men with his spear (2sam 23:8) while Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, slew 300 men (1 Chronicles 11:11). (KJV) I wonder if some of these are on there just for filler…[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m going to show you that this is a contradiction and I don’t want you to ignore me, so please reply to this post when you can. I don’t want to sound condescending, but there are several reasons why you are wrong, I’m going to list as many as I can and if you think I’m wrong then I’m up for further discussion on the matter.</p>
<p>To start with I want to quote the verses in a newer bible, lets say the NIV(New International Version). I will eventually quote the verses in the KJV.</p>
<p>1 Chronicles 11:11 this is the list of David’s mighty warriors: Jashobeam, a Hakmonite, was chief of the officers; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</p>
<p>2 Samuel 23:8 These are the names of David’s mighty warriors: Josheb-Basshebeth, a Tahkemonite, was chief of the Three; he raised his spear against eight hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter.</p>
<p>Immediately you may notice that there is no reference to Adino the Eznite. I should point out that depending on translation, the chief of the officers may also be referenced as the chief of the captains, it’s important to note that there are either 3 or 30 captains, there are 2 manuscripts that reference the captains and one translates as 3 while the other translates as 30. That’s also a contradiction but it isn’t relevant to this discussion.</p>
<p>The second thing that should be obvious is that the contradiction blatantly exists in the NIV, the <span class="bbcode-b">chief of the captains</span> either kills 300 or 800 men depending on the verse, he kills them <span class="bbcode-b">with a spear in one encounter</span>.</p>
<p>I realise the infographic references the KJV and that by me quoting the NIV it doesn’t necessarily say much. I quoted the NIV because the contradiction requires no explanation, whereas in the KJV kind of does. So, here are the verses in the KJV.</p>
<p>1 Chronicles 11:11 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.</p>
<p>2 Samuel 23:8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</p>
<p>What may be a common theme here is that either 300 or 800 men <span class="bbcode-b">are killed with a spear in one encounter</span>, what may also be a common theme is that the chief of the captains may be referred to as either Jashobeam or Josheb-Basshebeth, and as a Tachmonite or a Hachmonite.</p>
<p>There are two ways to explain how the contradiction exists in the KJV, my first explanation will be grammatically. In the KJV in Samuel it still states that the chief of the captains kills “800” men <span class="bbcode-b">with a spear in one sitting</span>, it’s referenced in Chronicles that the chief of the captains kills “300” men <span class="bbcode-b">with a spear in one sitting</span> and that should be obvious enough, but the very structure of the quote gives it away, let me explain.</p>
<blockquote>The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</blockquote>
<p>The quote says that the Tachmonite who was chief of the captains kills 800 men <span class="bbcode-b">with his spear in one encounter</span>, the part about Adino is essentially saying that Adino is also a captain(keep in mind there are 3 or 30 captains), grammatically that whole part about Adino can be omitted, it’s equivalent to when I say something in parenthesis. (Note: I am not a grammatician, (Yes I just made the word grammatician up, it’s like a mathematician but there’s a lot more Nazis)) Now, that is one way to explain the contradiction, the next way to explain the contradiction will blow your mind. Adino the Enzite is the same “person” as Jashobeam the Hachmonite. When the quote says “the same was”, it’s essentially saying “aka”, or essentially that the Tachmonite who sits chief among the captains, also known as Adino, killed 800 men with his spear in one encounter. What I said earlier about that part being omitted still holds true, and it makes even more sense now.</p>
<p>So, to explain the second contradiction further requires a bit of explanation on the translation. The first thing to note is that the New International Version of the bible doesn’t mention Adino, and therefore the contradiction is obvious in the NIV. The footnotes for NIV make the same mistake you do, I’ll quote the footnotes here: “2 Samuel 23:8 Some Septuagint manuscripts (see also 1 Chron. 11:11); Hebrew and other Septuagint manuscripts Three; it was Adino the Eznite who killed eight hundred men”, the whole issue here comes from the fact that many earlier bibles believe that “Josheb-Basshebeth” is a name, another footnote in the NIV is relevant so I’ll quote that here as well, “2 Samuel 23:8 Hebrew; some Septuagint manuscripts suggest Ish-Bosheth, that is, Esh-Baal (see also 1 Chron. 11:11 Jashobeam).”.</p>
<p>I should point out that I found out that “Josheb-Basshebeth” wasn’t a name after I had already researched the quotes and made a mock-up reply. I’m going to quote 2 Sam 23:8 from the <span class="bbcode-b">New</span> King James Version.</p>
<p>2 Samuel 23:8 These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-Basshebeth the Tachmonite, chief among the captains. He was called Adino the Eznite, because he had killed eight hundred men at one time.</p>
<p>The footnotes for the NKJV have the following to say: “2 Samuel 23:8 Literally One Who Sits in the Seat (compare 1 Chronicles 11:11)”. Josheb-Basshebeth literally translates to “the one who sits in the seat”, 2 Samuel 23:8 essentially reads as the following, “Adino the Eznite, of Hachmonite(either regional or family), who is the chief of the captains, who killed 800 men with his spear in one encounter”. “The one who sits in the seat” can either be translated to mean that as the story of David’s Mighty Warriors is being told, Adino was seated in the story(as opposed to the telling in the bible), or it could loosely mean that Adino who was sat in the chief seat of the captains, essentially the same meaning as Adino being chief of the captains.</p>
<p>So, the contradiction states that the chief of the captain kills either 300 or 800 men depending on what verse you look at, this is true whether or not you believe that Jashobeam and Adino are different people.</p>
<p>EDIT: DISCLAIMER: I can’t quite go into further on this <span class="bbcode-u">right</span> now, but after proof-reading some more I discovered an error. While Josheb-Basshebeth does literally mean “The one who sits in the seat” (also see: KJV 2 Sam 23:8 verse), Josheb-Bashebeth may or may not be the same person as Jashobeam(some sources state that they are), Adino the Eznite isn’t a name but a nickname that translates loosely to “he who delights in the spear”. This disclaimer doesn’t detract from what I say, the chief of the captains (referred to as Josheb-Basshebeth in Samuel and as Jashobeam in Chronicles) kills either 300 or 800 depending on the verse, Adino the Eznite still refers to the chief of the captains who killed 300 or 800 men with a spear.</p>
<p>EDIT: SECOND DISCLAIMER: “Josheb-Basshebeth” may actually be the name in Samuel not Adino, while the NIV footnotes state that Adino killed 800 men with a spear I am certain that Adino is the nickname to the chief of the captains who killed 300 or 800 men with a spear, my understanding after a second proof-reading is that Josheb-Basshebeth (the chief of the captains) killed 800 men in Samuel, but Jashobeam (the chief of the captains) killed 300 men in Chronicles. While it has been suggested that Josheb-Basshebeth and Jashobeam are the same person(I’ll research this tomorrow), if they are not the same person then that is 2 contradictions in these 2 verses instead of a single contradiction, as neither verse would correctly identify the chief of the captains NOR the amount killed. (The reality is that the chief of the captains killed 300 or 800 men in one encounter, whom was later nicknamed Adino the Eznite(loosely translates to "he who delights in the spear)) Just let that sink in for a minute.</p>

        <p>It was stupid for me to disregard the contradiction initially.</p>
<p>Sorry for the quick reply. I have a Calculus test this morning. I’ll come back later and add on to it.</p>
<p>After relooking at the verses, it seems to me that Adino and Jashobeam are the same man. Each slaying was on a seperate occasion. I could be wrong. I will definitely look into it deeper.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
Dad sent me this and we were talking about it this morning…</p>
<blockquote>How can this discrepancy be explained? 800 men slain in II Samuel 23:8 but 300 slain in I Chronicles 11:11. 
<p>This answer seems more helpful then others what are your thoughts? My son Jonathan posed this challenging question and thought I’d share with some nerdy folk for some additional help.</p>
<p>2 Samuel 23:8</p>
<p>These be the names of the mighty men whom David had,… Besides Joab his general, who is not mentioned; for these were all military men under him, which are distinguished into three classes; the first and highest consisted of three only, who were general officers; and the second also of three, who perhaps were colonels of regiments; and the third of thirty, who were captains of thousands and hundreds:</p>
<p>the Tachmonite that sat in the seat, the chief among the captains: not in the chief seat in the sanhedrim, and was the head of that, and so had the name of Tachmonite, from his wisdom, as the Jewish writers say; but in the council of war, where he presided under the general, or in his absence, and was, perhaps, lieutenant general, and so over all the captains; and therefore was neither David nor Joab, to whom some of the Rabbins apply these words, as observed by Kimchi; or rather he was the chief of the three to whom he belonged; his name, in 1Ch 11:11, is Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, or the son of an Hachmonite, the same as in 1Ch 27:2; and here it may be as well read Josheb-bashebeth the Tachmonite, the same name, with a little variation; which seem to be names given him, taken from his character and office; for his proper name was as follows:</p>
<p>the same was Adino the Eznite: so called either from the family he was of, or from the place of his birth; though a learned man thinks it should be read as in the following supplement (q):</p>
<p>he lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time; which, though a very extraordinary exploit, yet not more strange, or so strange as that of Shamgar’s slaying six hundred men with an ox goad, Jdg 3:31, or as that of Samson’s killing a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass, Jdg 15:15, in 1Ch 11:11, the number is only three hundred, which some attempt to reconcile by observing, that not the same person is meant in both places; here he is called Joshebbashebeth, there Jashobeam; here the Tachmonite, there the son of an Hachmonite; nor is he there called Adino the Eznite; but yet it seems plain that in both places the chief of the three worthies of David is meant, and so the same man: others observe, that he engaged with eight hundred, and slew three hundred of them, when the rest fled, and were pursued and killed by his men; and he routing them, and being the occasion of their being slain, the slaying of them all is ascribed to him; or he first slew three hundred, and five hundred more coming upon him, he slew them also: but what Kimchi offers seems to be best, that there were two battles, in which this officer was engaged; at one of them he slew eight hundred, and at the other three hundred; for so what is omitted in the books of Samuel, and of the Kings, is frequently supplied in the books of Chronicles, as what one evangelist in the New Testament omits, another records. The above learned writer ® conjectures, that ש being the first letter of the words for three and eight, and the numeral letter being here reduced to its word at length, through a mistake in the copier, was written שמנה, “eight”, instead of שלש, “three”: the Septuagint version is,"he drew out his spear against eight hundred soldiers at once,’'and says nothing of slaying them; and seems to be the true sense of the word, as the same learned writer (s) has abundantly shown.</p>
<p>(q) Kennicott’s Dissert. 1. so Hillerus in Onomastic. Sacr. p.</p>
<p>230, 231, renders it, “the glory of the spear or spearmen stood against eight hundred”, &amp;c. and Weemse, “his delight was to lift up his spear”. Exercitat. 16. p. 137. ® P. 96. (s) P. 103.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Frell, post:11, topic:478979”]There is no arguing, they’re trying to defend something that they’ve lived all their life thinking is true. I understand that.</p>
<p>There’s so many contradictions surrounding religion nowadays I’m amazed people still follow it.</p>
<p>If there is a god then he can’t blame me. So many religions out there that say the others are wrong and you’ll go to hell for not believing. Getting into heaven is a gamble.[/quote]<br>
And in this post, we see an implication that science doesn’t have its own contradictions. You, sir, are an idiot.</p>
<p>As somebody who believes in God, this entire website is way too full of wannabe-edgy kids. (Not that I think Frell is a kid.) I hardly believe that life itself could be created by a bunch of atoms rearranging themselves. Yes, I believe in some level of evolution to the point of the weak dying off. Yes, I believe in most scientific discoveries. But no, I don’t believe the entire universe was created by one huge explosion or any other theory that scientists have came up with.</p>
<p>If OP actually expected a topic to stick to just “the Bible” and not to a full-on religion debate he should probably drop out of the 8th grade right now.</p>

[/quote]<br>
But you’re perfectly fine with some dude creating it from nothing?[/quote]<br>
“Some dude.” “Nothing.” Look up the definition of God. The entire idea of God is under the basis that we are in a completely separate “realm” than whatever is godly.</p>
<p>Everything we know has a beginning and an end. Everything. And with that logic some entity had to have created everything we know at some point.</p>
<p>My post wasn’t even to argue whether God is real or not. I just wanted to point out how edgy all of the individuals on this site think they are. No community I’ve ever been a part of online is as close-minded and immature as this one; that very well could be simply because of how low the average age is. However old the people posting may be, a great portion of what I read on here makes me as annoyed I would be sitting in a preschool classroom.</p>

<p>As I said, I know and believe in science. The more I learn about science the more I believe in God. Trying to put God into anything science-related is completely idiotic considering that the belief is he created the science you’re even trying to use.</p>
<p>But refer to the above where I stated my true intent of even posting. Participating in any sort of biblical argument is baseless. Regardless of how true someone’s comments might be, any person in that argument already knows what they believe. Especially on this site, the only thing you can expect even mentioning religion is flaming.</p>

<p>There is however no evidence that point to a creator. You cannot put your god into scientific gaps until they are patched.[/quote]This basically sums up my opinion on the matter (hehehe no pun intended). Think of it like this: With computers, ideally you can create every possible conversation, sound, song, etc… in just thousands of bytes. You can also create every single possible picture (ideally). You can almost think of each image or song as a huuuuuuge number, like a 32-bit 100x100 image would be a 320000-bit number. If you had a program that incremented this number over time, you’d pass over literally every possibility for a 100x100 image, including things like your eye, fingerprint, and anything else you can think of. In terms of real life, every property of every atom could be represented as one number. Who’s not to say the universe as we know it is just the progression of one?</p>
