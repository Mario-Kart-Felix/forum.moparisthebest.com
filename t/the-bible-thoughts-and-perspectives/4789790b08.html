        <p>It’s just a large book written by a man with a crazy imagination a long time ago. He lived in the middle of no where so when he passed away, his home eroded into dust, yet the book was kept in a small chest. Thousands of years later, some wanderers come across the small chest half buried in sand and almost destroyed. They opened the chest to find this book. Since there was no hint of life or inhabitance in the area, they believed that a “greater power” or “god” had dropped this chest onto Earth to guide life. Then a man who followed a completely different belief, “Jesus”, was going around and using his mastery of herbs and medicine to cure people. Since many folk of that time were not that bright, they believed that he was sent from above. Then when people began to come to him and worship him, the kingdom thought that this should not be, as only the Ruler himself should be worshipped. Therefore the mere herbalist “Jesus” was crucified (he wasn’t the only one, it was common back then) and died that day. Now the Ruler did the right thing as this man is only a very good herbalist and nothing more AND he was indirectly threatening the Ruler’s power. I have no clue why people say he is a “savior” or “he died for us” because NO, he DIDN’T die for you, the only people he saved were the ones the medicine was used on, and he is JUST A MAN. Then, when the wanderers came back to the city, they gave the book to the closest bookstore to see how much they could sell it for. This man, by chance, was a patient of “Jesus” and believed that the people that brought this scripture to him were God’s Messengers. He praised them and spent the last 40 years of his life making copies of this book. Years later, after his passing. His son found these books in a dusty closet in the attic of their cobblestone home. He opened one and saw that the book was written by God. He quickly left his house and displayed the books to the entire city. Although many wise men of the time knew that God was not real, they did not altercate with this young lad. Later, this boy was found by a small group of weak-minded men who wanted to tell all of the contents of the book. Therefore the messed up religion of Christianity was born. Years and years went by and people with different ideas created their own branch of this “religion” and began worshipping anyone Jesus was related to. Things got so bad that the Church was actually able to have almost equal power to the Ruler of the country. When the funding became a hassle, they began tricking the weak minds of the followers of Christ to give the damned Church money for “God”. Which became absolutely ridiculous. No one could stop it either because most people at the time were Christian and would kill or convert a non-Christian. They destroyed the culture of ancient life and are continuing to destroy our culture as we speak. The damn Bible has been repeated so many times that people have it still in their heads. How is listening and reading the same damn thing over and over again interesting? No one knows, and yet these practitioners keep on repeating this garbage as if it is new! In conclusion, Christianity is a big bluff, the devoted followers are brainwashed and weak, everything is a lie, and it was all a big misunderstanding.</p>

        <p>[quote=“The Web Guy, post:159, topic:478979”]My Thoughts and Perspectives on The Bible-</p>
<p>I’ve read The Bible, front to back (maybe skimmed over a few pages, that looked unimportant), and it’s a very interesting book. I did not read it for religious purposes (I suppose you can say I did…) But I, myself, am not religious (Atheism, ftw.) I purely read it to try and understand why people revolve themselves around it and build their life off this one book, after reading it, I still don’t understand. o.O<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">I personally find the Bible controlling, and it brainwashes people, and essentially forces them to build their lives around this book.</span> And they influence other around them to do so too (not true for everyone, but most.) As of now I have about 300 post-it notes coming out of various different pages of my version of The Bible, in-case I need to look back or reference something in an argument with a religious person… I find it an interesting book when it comes to reading it for literature. But<span class="bbcode-b"> I strongly strongly believe that no one should every structure their life around this book (nor any other book, for that matter.)</span>[/quote]</p>
<p>The Bible offers structure for those who need rehabilitation or a direction in their life. There are many lessons and teachings in the Bible that humanity would greatly benefit from. Loving one’s neighbor, treating others as you would like to be treated, etc.</p>

<p>I’ve read The Bible, front to back (maybe skimmed over a few pages, that looked unimportant), and it’s a very interesting book. I did not read it for religious purposes (I suppose you can say I did…) But I, myself, am not religious (Atheism, ftw.) I purely read it to try and understand why people revolve themselves around it and build their life off this one book, after reading it, I still don’t understand. o.O<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">I personally find the Bible controlling, and it brainwashes people, and essentially forces them to build their lives around this book.</span> And they influence other around them to do so too (not true for everyone, but most.) As of now I have about 300 post-it notes coming out of various different pages of my version of The Bible, in-case I need to look back or reference something in an argument with a religious person… I find it an interesting book when it comes to reading it for literature. But<span class="bbcode-b"> I strongly strongly believe that no one should every structure their life around this book (nor any other book, for that matter.)</span><br>

<p>The Bible offers structure for those who need rehabilitation or a direction in their life. There are many lessons and teachings in the Bible that humanity would greatly benefit from. Loving one’s neighbor, treating others as you would like to be treated, etc.[/quote]<br>

<blockquote>If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them</blockquote>
Kill homosexuals for being homosexual.
<blockquote>Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then let all the congregation stone him.</blockquote>
Kill people who don't acknowledge god.
<blockquote>If a man takes a wife and, after sleeping with her, dislikes her and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,” then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin. Her father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. Now he has slandered her and said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.” Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town, and the elders shall take the man and punish him. They shall fine him a hundred shekels[a] of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives. If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.</blockquote>
Stone women who cannot produce evidence of their own virginity.
<blockquote>But the woman said to him, "Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you then laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?</blockquote>
Practitioners of other religions should be put to death.
<blockquote>Therefore you are to observe the sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.</blockquote>
Kill people who work on [s]Sunday[/s] Saturday.

        <p>Lol, there’s no scriptures telling Christians to punish infidels…</p>
<p>In fact…</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 5:12-13<br>
12  For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?<br>
13  &gt;&gt;&gt;But them that are without God judgeth.&lt;&lt;&lt; Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>
<p>John 3:17-21<br>
17  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.<br>
18  He that believeth on him is not condemned: &gt;&gt;&gt;but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
19  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and &gt;&gt;&gt;men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
20  For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.<br>
21  But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>

Thanks for reading,<br>
Docent[/quote]</p>
<p>Did you do any kind of research on Christianity from un-biased atheist sources before making so many false claims? I skimmed your post and could tell you probably are regurgitating what someone else told you.</p>
<p>I will simply encourage you to do your own research, and begin by looking up “Sodom and Gomorrah found”. As we continue to produce significant findings (and grow in overall knowledge of history), it’s becoming apparently clear that this “old, fake book” is actually extremely accurate, even down to it’s prophecies (prophecy is Tyrus is a good place to start).</p>

        <p>The fact of the matter is, Christianity is based on love and grace. Forgiving those who may have wronged you, believing that only god can judge, etc. Of course you will have the loonies like Westboro Baptist but they are an extremely small slice of the Christian population.</p>

<blockquote>Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. 2 Therefore he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. 3 For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same; 4 for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath upon the one who practices evil.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar’s ﻿﻿tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know. 11 “If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I ﻿﻿appeal to Caesar.</blockquote>
<p>Sounds to me like they are not appalled by capital punishment. How forgiving!</p>

<p>Sounds like a quote of what I said.</p>
<blockquote>Nature adapts just like we do. It's a general relation to evolution, adapting to survive, for the better good through the perception of an individual. This argument does not hold water at all. Destruction is subjective, and that's your perception as other people have their own perceptions. However being a propaganda machine of bigotry to stifle the progress and happiness of others for the sake of what you deem right or wrong is NOT okay.</blockquote>
<p>We don’t hate christians, I only have a problem with christians (and people in general) when they cross this line. Vise versa, I don’t cross these lines either.</p>
