Think of it like this: With computers, ideally you can create every possible conversation, sound, song, etc… in just thousands of bytes. You can also create every single possible picture (ideally). You can almost think of each image or song as a huuuuuuge number, like a 32-bit 100x100 image would be a 320000-bit number. If you had a program that incremented this number over time, you’d pass over literally every possibility for a 100x100 image, including things like your eye, fingerprint, and anything else you can think of.

If a robot was created that could learn as well as a human (and make choices, of course) then it might as well be considered human. Choices that aren’t based on experience are instincts. If you want proof of this, look at people who grow up in different areas of the world. Your church has taught you too much bad.</p>

[/quote]<br>
Could you please explain why you think this?[/quote]<br>
“I think, therefore I am.”</p>
<p>Under the belief that everything is atom-based, physical, there is no free will. Everything’s just a chain reaction. Life itself isn’t real. And in response to Lin, too lazy to actually quote, if a block falls off a table is that based off a memory? Or is it just following physics? If everything’s PHYSICAL, then PHYSICS is all that applies. “Mental” is just those physical connections acting up. All of those “memories” are just a chain reaction.</p>
<p>Unless you’re talking about some dark matter shit or something else science has yet to discover, science is purely physical based. That’s all they try to prove is that there’s physical reasoning for everything that happens. (Just to argue what I’m sure would come next.)</p>
<p>Considering I’m typing this out, thinking about what I’m writing, I believe I have free will. Nothing purely physical could manage that, and it would require some foreign entity to give living things that ability to overcome simple physics.</p>
<p>I read an entire book over logical ways of thinking of God a few years back. Much sense was made.</p>
<p>And no, my church hasn’t taught me bad. You just insinuate that yes, everything is physical, (which IS all atheists believe) and then try to deny it with free will.</p>
<p>I’m done arguing about this as I didn’t even mean to join the argument. As I said before, nobody’s going to change their opinion.</p>

        <p>I don’t trust the linguistic foundations of the Bible, since a lot of the context is lost in the translation and sometimes part of the text is rendered completely meaningless (just look at the differences between the oxford and penguin classic books, you will notice that for Greek the texts are really quite different despite being based on the same original text).</p>
<p>The bible is the word of God; a linguistic translation of the bible is no longer the word of God as it has been changed during the process of translation. Therefore unless I read the original manuscripts I don’t believe anything written in the Bible (that doesn’t mean I don’t believe in a God though)</p>

Slave Slyth: Niall would have a fun time with you, but I’m taking it. If have to learn the scientific theories before you discredit it.</p>
<p>Atoms/Molecules rearrange all the time. We have seen that several amino acids can form by themselves. RNA can form by itself. The development of life is a quite gradual process.</p>
<p>As for big bang, nothing exploded. The universe have expanded, and we are seeing the expansion today. We can see the fingerprint of the early universe (Background radiation).</p>
<p>And I could go on further if I had more time. Go check out modern science by your own.</p>
<p>There is however no evidence that point to a creator. You cannot put your god into scientific gaps until they are patched.<br>
[/quote]This basically sums up my opinion on the matter (hehehe no pun intended). Think of it like this: With computers, ideally you can create every possible conversation, sound, song, etc… in just thousands of bytes. You can also create every single possible picture (ideally). You can almost think of each image or song as a huuuuuuge number, like a 32-bit 100x100 image would be a 320000-bit number. If you had a program that incremented this number over time, you’d pass over literally every possibility for a 100x100 image, including things like your eye, fingerprint, and anything else you can think of. In terms of real life, every property of every atom could be represented as one number. Who’s not to say the universe as we know it is just the progression of one?<br>
[/quote]That makes perfect sense for anything inanimate like atoms. Now imagine the pixels with free will.</p>
<p>Not everything is physical.[/quote]</p>
<p>Free will is a result of your brain, which is very physical and a product of evolution/natural selection.</p>

There is no arguing, they’re trying to defend something that they’ve lived all their life thinking is true. I understand that.</p>
<p>There’s so many contradictions surrounding religion nowadays I’m amazed people still follow it.</p>
<p>If there is a god then he can’t blame me. So many religions out there that say the others are wrong and you’ll go to hell for not believing. Getting into heaven is a gamble.<br>
[/quote]<br>
And in this post, we see an implication that science doesn’t have its own contradictions. You, sir, are an idiot.[/quote]</p>
<p>So, Slave Scyth, in a few posts after this one you made the claim that you think this community is close-minded, do you not see the irony in calling a community close-minded when you, yourself also make close-minded statements? Frell made <span class="bbcode-b">no</span> implications to suggest that science doesn’t have contradictions, it is presumably your own close-minded view that made you think that any criticism of religion means that the person making those criticisms also thinks that science is on the contrary to those criticisms.</p>

<p>I hardly believe that life itself could be created by a bunch of atoms rearranging themselves. Yes, I believe in some level of evolution to the point of the weak dying off. Yes, I believe in most scientific discoveries. But no, I don’t believe the entire universe was created by one huge explosion or any other theory that scientists have came up with.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Perhaps the reason that, presumably, you think you know more than thousands of independent scientists, is that your perception and understanding of the scientific theories you are criticising here are fundamentally flawed. Abiogenesis is not the idea that life can be created by “a bunch of atoms rearranging themselves”, at least not in the sense you’re thinking. Several experiments, namely the Miller-Urey experiments, have shown that under certain varying conditions <span class="bbcode-b">non-organic material can form organic material</span>, this is not an opinion, this is not speculation, this is the observation of several experiments that are repeatable. The results are <span class="bbcode-b">facts</span>. Depending on how you want to define life, scientists can show that non-organic material can result in life through conditions that would have existed on the primordial earth.</p>
<p>Evolution. I don’t really know what you think of evolution but again you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what evolution is. “Strongest of the fittest” is a grossly false misconception of what evolution actually is, it’s also an incredibly deceptive misconception because terms like “strongest, fittest, weakest” are human constructs that mean absolutely nothing. Natural selection in the simplest possible terms is the idea that an organism that is best adapt to change is most likely to survive. Natural selection doesn’t care about terms like strong, fit, weak, all natural selection cares about is that if you’re an organism and you can change to adapt to a new environment, you are more likely to survive. If this seems logical to you them bam, you believe in evolution.</p>
<p>Finally, the big bang. The big bang <span class="bbcode-b">is not and was not a huge explosion</span>, the big bang is the rapid expansion of space and time, the big bang is still going on today and we can observe this, and we have known this for close to a century now.</p>

I’m open minded, but I demand evidence. And I demand that the evidence disprove the current accepted theory.<br>
[/quote]Well you’re not going to get any evidence of God until the rapture. Sorry about your luck. That’s why it’s called “faith.” (Though even logic can lead you to the conclusion that there’s a God. That’s the exact reason why there’s so many scientists that are also Christian.)[/quote]</p>
<p>You mean, that’s why so few scientists are religious, never mind Christian?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6691/full/394313a0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6691/full/394313a0.html</a> - The full article requires payment, but if you click on “Figures and tables” to the right you’ll get a small table from the article which has all the relevant information you’ll need. I’ll sum it up, in 1998, 7% of the leading scientists questioned had a personal belief in a god (READ: NOT SPECIFICALLY THE CHRISTIAN GOD) as opposed to 72.2% and 20.8% which were atheist and agnostic respectively.</p>
<p>Oh, and keep in mind, while you try to argue for god’s existence, keep in mind the same arguments also apply to: Allah, Jehovah, The Flying Spaghetti Monster, etc.</p>

<p>Could you please explain why you think this?<br>
[/quote]<br>
“I think, therefore I am.”[/quote]</p>
<p>The brain is a physical object that obeys the laws of physics, all your actions, your memories, your logical thinking abilities are a result of electrical and chemical reactions that are going on in your brain, those reactions and interactions are measurable. The brain is not a supernatural object and the ability to think and make choices is not a non-physical ability.</p>
<p>Free will is an illusion. We can make choices, we can decide what we do, to some that is considered free will, but it is not free will. If you knew, as a matter of fact, that you had free will, you wouldn’t have free will.</p>
<p>PS, “I think therefore I am” has nothing to do with free will, the ability to think is all the proof you will ever have that you on an individual level exists. You cannot prove anything else beyond the fact that you can think, and you can’t even prove that the thoughts you have are your own.</p>

        <p>I believe that The Bible is just a book of morals that helped to keep people in line as stated previously.</p>
<p>I believe there is a probability in an afterlife because of the ghosts. Call me crazy or whatever, I don’t care, but from my perspective you cannot ignore it. Even if 99% of the hauntings were hoaxes, there would probably still be 100 that are real. It doesn’t add up to our current understanding of the universe, so therefore it is deemed nonsensical. Then you have all of the thermal technology and frequency readings and whatnot. It appears to me that something paranormal is obviously happening and ghosts seem to be a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>I believe that when I die it will most definitely be a surprise. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Whether I find there is an afterlife or not, I know not, nor do I pretend to know.</p>
<p>I also agree with Einstein that the more and more I learn about the universe the more and more the existence for a higher-up being seems plausible. A great quote from Einstein that pretty much summarizes my feelings on the matter, “A man’s ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.”</p>

<p>I believe there is a probability in an afterlife because of the ghosts. Call me crazy or whatever, I don’t care, but from my perspective you cannot ignore it. Even if 99% of the hauntings were hoaxes, there would probably still be 100 that are real. It doesn’t add up to our current understanding of the universe, so therefore it is deemed nonsensical. Then you have all of the thermal technology and frequency readings and whatnot. It appears to me that something paranormal is obviously happening and ghosts seem to be a plausible explanation.</p>
<p>I believe that when I die it will most definitely be a surprise. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Whether I find there is an afterlife or not, I know not, nor do I pretend to know.</p>
<p>I also agree with Einstein that the more and more I learn about the universe the more and more the existence for a higher-up being seems plausible. A great quote from Einstein that pretty much summarizes my feelings on the matter, “A man’s ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.”[/quote]</p>
<p>Ghosts, really? That’s your plausible explanation… so why don’t we have Romans raging at us when we’re walking about in our day to day lifes eh, surely there presence would be located somewhere; the notion of ghosts seem to me quite frankly ridiculous furthermore anyone claiming to communicate them is quite obviously crazy especially if they’re communicating with people that wouldn’t even speak their native language.</p>

I did not say that ghosts absolutely exist, that I only accept it as a probability however so slight. I believe that once you have eliminated an explanation you may have eliminated a solution. Our understanding of what goes on is only to the extent of what we understand. Science has been wrong countless of times in the past, but that is the true “science” of it. We are always perfecting our understanding of the universe trying to learn more. Aristotle believed that heaver objects fell faster and it wasn’t until the 17th century when Galileo proved him wrong. Then Newton expressed gravity as the attraction between objects especially those with larger masses (Earth). Then Einstein came along and said that mass bent the spacetime continuum and that is what caused the attractive force that we call gravity. If everyone just said that obviously larger objects fall faster than other lighter objects we would be no farther than we were 2000 or so years ago.</p>

<p>You didn’t really say ghosts were a probability “however so slight”, you said you believe the probability of the afterlife “because of the ghosts!” Than you also said “something paranormal is obviously happening and ghosts seem to be a plausible explanation”</p>
<p>I fail to see how something paranormal is obviously happening. Ghosts are not a plausible explanation, because ghosts are not compatible with physics. Your body is gone when your body is gone. Your mind is gone when your brain is gone.</p>
<p>Aristotle thought heavy objects would fall faster, and he never even bothered to try it for himself? Thats not scientific. How can you use that to discredit science?</p>
<p>edit: I think I accidentally stickied this topic so I will unsticky it. If it was actually stickied by someone else, feel free to do it again, my bad.</p>
