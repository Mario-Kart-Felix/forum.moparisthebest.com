    <title>The Bible [Thoughts and Perspectives]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-bible-thoughts-and-perspectives/478979</link>
    <description>How do you think it was all writen, and do you believe in it? I, personally, think it to be a book of myths and legends used to scare people. I mean, back in the day (BC-AD 1800 or so) wouldn&#39;t people have recognized that there&#39;s no way to catch them for any crimes they commit, nor any punishment? Wouldn&#39;t a Bible technically be the perfect way to trick people into thinking theres an all powerful camera in the sky always watching and ready to punish you? I think it was made by a few good men with a few good intentions to convince people to go along with morals and law-abiding-ness. I don&#39;t think anything in it is real or true, more like fairy tails told to kids to keep them away from strangers, but on a much larger scale. Also, as technology and ways to find people for commiting crimes has improved, people have relied less on the Bible and the Catholic church has said that many of the Bible stories are &quot;Myths with Meaning&quot;. I think it was a primitive version of, as I stated before, security cameras and law.</description>

“Better to live and not know, then to know and not live.”</p>
<p>I came up with this quote a few weeks ago. Since I moved out on my own I have been going through a mental epiphany. I’ve realized at a deep and philosophical level that the reason I am an Athiest is not for myself, but for all humanity. While there are personal reasons influencing my opinions and decisions, I remind myself that while Christianity stands for living a life for another life, I can live my life to better the life of myself and the lives of others I live around. I live an objective life where I question everything and I take everything into consideration. Though without valid proof, I see no point in even considering some possibilities.</p>
<p>I don’t expect anything in return for the good deeds I do. I am a public servant, I work for the federal government. I clean bathrooms and take out trash for a living. I do it all with a smile too and there is never a negative word that comes out of my mouth while I am doing my job. I love my job, I get to meet new people and learn new things. Though, some may see being a janitor pretty lame, to me it is a job that I can do and I can do well until I move into smoke jumping and school.</p>
<p>I do good things not expecting good things in return. I surround myself with positive people from my generation and possibly from others who I know are intelligent people who live their life for others and themselves, not for something in the sky who demands worship.</p>
<p>I live life to discover and make the world a better place, not to repress opposite opinions and keep the world in the 100’s.</p>
<p>This song by Nothing More is almost 100% accurate with christianity in America.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Frell, post:2, topic:478979”]back then life was so shitty that if people knew there wasn’t anything stopping them from going apeshit they would and the kings wouldn’t be living the high life anymore</p>
<p>so they created a deity to answer questions about life and promote good morals[/quote]</p>
<p>The old testament was written from roughly 2600BC to 0BC. It contains, in Leviticus, a complete explanation of the procedure of the priests and the rituals of the covenant. God was distant, formal, and exacting. In the new testament, God appears as a man, not a cloud of fire. He is a personal, friendly, loving God, compared to the justice-dispensing holocaust making God of the OT. So thematically, it’s not about morals or social control, it’s about humanities relation to the divine, or supernatural. And this relationship itself is reflected by Politics.</p>
<p>The Romans had a God for everything. And they found analogues of their Gods in every culture they conquered. So just as their politics were tolerance and assimilation, their spirituality was. Christianity represented the cult of the individual. It could not be assimilated, so it devoured the roman empire from the inside out.</p>
<p>The bible is revolutionary, if you read it right.</p>

<p>EVERY single soul of the eight billion have heard of Jesus Christ - their opportunity. Christians are not people who are ‘brainwashed’.  THEY make the choice, after studying the bible, come to a conclusion, if the bible is their guide to life.[/quote]<br>
Pascal’s wager is a bad argument for Christianity. First of all, the argument only makes sense if you consider that the probability of god existing is 50%; however, it is important to realise that we are talking only about the Christian god here. Once you factor in other worshippable gods it quickly becomes apparent that the odds of you accidentally worshipping the wrong god are actually much higher than picking the right one. Also, the wager permits for only one concurrent god. What if this isn’t true? What if by choosing to worship one ‘correct’ god you inadvertently offend another ‘correct’ god, leading yourself to damnation anyway?</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the core of the argument. Pascal’s wager assumes that a soul and an afterlife exist. However, we have seen no evidence supporting such a claim. Why then should we act as if they do? The wager also has some moral problems. It encourages people who do not actually believe in god to “fake it until they make it”. This raises a few questions: assuming god is real, is he able to distinguish between this ‘faking’ of belief? Furthermore, is he indifferent to it or would he punish souls who don’t truly believe in him? Would god be willing to accept someone who worshipped him purely to avoid hell?</p>
<p>Ironically, if you wanted to accept Pascal’s wager then you would actually be better off worshipping a god that does not require exclusive worship because that would raise your chances of worshipping the right god.</p>

The fact of the matter is, Christianity is based on love and grace. Forgiving those who may have wronged you, believing that only god can judge, etc. Of course you will have the loonies like Westboro Baptist but they are an extremely small slice of the Christian population.</p>
<p>I don’t see the reason for atheists or anyone to hate Christianity. Christians don’t hate you because you don’t think there is a god, why must you hate them for believing in one?<br>

 Romans 13:1-4:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. 2 Therefore he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves. 3 For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same; 4 for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath upon the one who practices evil.</p>

 Acts 25:10-11:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>But Paul said, “I am standing before Caesar’s ﻿﻿tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know. 11 “If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of those things is true of which these men accuse me, no one can hand me over to them. I ﻿﻿appeal to Caesar.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Sounds to me like they are not appalled by capital punishment. How forgiving![/quote]</p>
<p>The quote from Acts is Paul’s trial for being a Christian? He is accepting capital punishment because he is a firm believer that he will go to heaven. Because of this, he is not appalled by the thought of dying for what he believes in and is most likely content with being martyr for the Christian faith.</p>
<p>The quote from Romans does not necessarily mean death for one’s transgressions. It is more along the lines of “God put this government in place, obey the government and you don’t have to worry about the government authority. If you do wrong, God will send someone to make it right”.</p>
<p>The whole capital punishment quip is an interesting one and it is one that I struggle with. I believe that men should not have the right to judge another man to the point of taking their life. But then I see <a href="http://www.13newsnow.com/story/news/local/mycity/portsmouth/2015/06/28/one-year-old-shot-in-the-head-in-portsmouth/29424553/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> on the local news and agree that they should be put to death.</p>

<p>I agree with you. I have suggested to some Christian friends to simply separate themselves from gays if they truly have an issue being around them. It keeps everyone happy and they are well within their rights to do so.</p>

<p>Sounds like a quote of what I said.</p>
<blockquote>Nature adapts just like we do. It's a general relation to evolution, adapting to survive, for the better good through the perception of an individual. This argument does not hold water at all. Destruction is subjective, and that's your perception as other people have their own perceptions. However being a propaganda machine of bigotry to stifle the progress and happiness of others for the sake of what you deem right or wrong is NOT okay.</blockquote>
<p>We don’t hate christians, I only have a problem with christians (and people in general) when they cross this line. Vise versa, I don’t cross these lines either.</p>

<p>Did you do any kind of research on Christianity from un-biased atheist sources before making so many false claims? I skimmed your post and could tell you probably are regurgitating what someone else told you.</p>
<p>I will simply encourage you to do your own research, and begin by looking up “Sodom and Gomorrah found”. As we continue to produce significant findings (and grow in overall knowledge of history), it’s becoming apparently clear that this “old, fake book” is actually extremely accurate, even down to it’s prophecies (prophecy is Tyrus is a good place to start).</p>

<p>My Thoughts and Perspectives on The Bible-</p>
<p>I’ve read The Bible, front to back (maybe skimmed over a few pages, that looked unimportant), and it’s a very interesting book. I did not read it for religious purposes (I suppose you can say I did…) But I, myself, am not religious (Atheism, ftw.) I purely read it to try and understand why people revolve themselves around it and build their life off this one book, after reading it, I still don’t understand. o.O<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">I personally find the Bible controlling, and it brainwashes people, and essentially forces them to build their lives around this book.</span> And they influence other around them to do so too (not true for everyone, but most.) As of now I have about 300 post-it notes coming out of various different pages of my version of The Bible, in-case I need to look back or reference something in an argument with a religious person… I find it an interesting book when it comes to reading it for literature. But<span class="bbcode-b"> I strongly strongly believe that no one should every structure their life around this book (nor any other book, for that matter.)</span></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The Bible offers structure for those who need rehabilitation or a direction in their life. There are many lessons and teachings in the Bible that humanity would greatly benefit from. Loving one’s neighbor, treating others as you would like to be treated, etc.</p>

<p>What about punishing infidels?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Got a verse in the bible specifically referencing christians punishing infidels? I’m not sure there is one but I may be wrong.[/quote]</p>
<blockquote>If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them</blockquote>
Kill homosexuals for being homosexual.
<blockquote>Bring the one who has cursed outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then let all the congregation stone him.</blockquote>
Kill people who don't acknowledge god.
<blockquote>If a man takes a wife and, after sleeping with her, dislikes her and slanders her and gives her a bad name, saying, “I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,” then the young woman’s father and mother shall bring to the town elders at the gate proof that she was a virgin. Her father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter in marriage to this man, but he dislikes her. Now he has slandered her and said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.” Then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town, and the elders shall take the man and punish him. They shall fine him a hundred shekels[a] of silver and give them to the young woman’s father, because this man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. She shall continue to be his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives. If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found, she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done an outrageous thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.</blockquote>
Stone women who cannot produce evidence of their own virginity.
<blockquote>But the woman said to him, "Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. Why are you then laying a snare for my life to bring about my death?</blockquote>
Practitioners of other religions should be put to death.
<blockquote>Therefore you are to observe the sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.</blockquote>
Kill people who work on [s]Sunday[/s] Saturday.
