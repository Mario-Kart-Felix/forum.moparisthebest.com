    <description>Hello,,

I have followed JC&#39;s tut for fun pk,

I have this [code]		if (!IsInFightCave() &amp;&amp; !inFunPk() &amp;&amp; !isInPitGame() &amp;&amp; !isInPitRoom() &amp;&amp; playerRights != 2 &amp;&amp; playerRights != 3 &amp;&amp; action != 1 &amp;&amp; deathStage == 2 &amp;&amp;  System.currentTimeMillis() - deathTimer &gt;= 2500) {
		client killerz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[KillerId];
		youdied();
		killerz.sM(&quot;You have defeated &quot;+playerName+&quot;.&quot;);
		}[/code]

It says in wilderniss You have defeated playername.
But in fun pk it doesnt, please help me!
Thanks</description>

              <p>In that case you can just do:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (!IsInFightCave() &amp;&amp; !inFunPk() &amp;&amp; !isInPitGame() &amp;&amp; !isInPitRoom() &amp;&amp; playerRights != 2 &amp;&amp; playerRights != 3 &amp;&amp; action != 1 &amp;&amp; deathStage == 2 &amp;&amp;  System.currentTimeMillis() - deathTimer &gt;= 2500) {
		client killerz = (client) server.playerHandler.players[KillerId];
		youdied();
		sM("You have defeated "+playerName+".");
		}</code></pre>
<p>Because you are just sending information to the person that killed the person, not the person who died.</p>
