    <title>Allergies maybe?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allergies-maybe/1958</link>
    <description>Every year since I&#39;ve been in Georgia (Moved from Lake Charles, Louisiana five years ago), during the seasons Spring and Summer, I have what seems to be like really bad allergies. When I get up in the morning, I can&#39;t breath through my nose and I literally will sneeze for 10s of minutes. The only medicine that works are these tiny pink pills, Benydrill I think, but they make me VERY tired. I always get them in the morning and around 6 at night. It&#39;s so bad, that when I try to blow my nose, nothing happens except my ears pop. One time I even busted a vein thingy in my face. Only the medicine can fix it. My nose also runs like Niagra Falls. Just now I&#39;ve been sneezing so much, it must have cut my nose because I was bleeding for a bit. It&#39;s only during Spring and Summer though, and Doctors never diagnosed me with Allergies, and I&#39;m not allergic to anything.</description>

              <p>I've been here for 5 years. Moved from Lake Charles, Louisiana. People here complain about the humidity and the hotness. They don't know anything rofl. It's so humid where I used to live, it felt thick. You could cut through the humid air with a butter knife. So humid you would sweat at like 60 degrees.</p>

<p>Not trying to creep you out or anything, but I've always had a fetish or something for Canadians and Russians.</p>

<p>In 8th grade, I met a girl named Sam. She was awesome and pretty and was Canadian. However she was with some Matt guy, and I was crushed to find that out. Over the summer he got his hair shaved and they broke up because of it (dunno why) and I seriously wanted to date her. Then some girl moved in across the street from me. All three of us became best friends. Then one day Sam told me she had to talk to me about something. I was soo happy. Then she said Hope (Girl that moved in) wanted to date me, and that I should ask her out. That sucked. A few days later me and Hope went to the movies, and started dating. That lasted a week. Then last summer, my girlfriend went to New York to visit her mom. Sam's mom went to Eckards where my mom worked, and said hey. Then she said Sam missed me and wanted to hang out, and she plays bass and wants to start a band or something cause I play guitar and have a drummer. She gave my mom Sam's number cause they had moved, and said give it to me. I was really sad <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=3" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>Sorry for long boring story lmfao. Got sidetracked and was trying to get away from my project.</p>

              <p>Starting in march, A LOT of pollen goes around in that area. I go down to Florida every once in a while to see my grandparents, and the pollen gets extremely bad. When we drove down one year our dark blue truck nearly turned yellow <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Are you new to georgia? If so then thats probably the case, but either way pollen really does effect some people. You should ask your doctor if they have anything good for it? Keep your windows shut at night and you should sleep a bit better, and if you have air conditioning then try to keep your windows shut all the time. <br>Btw, DONT take claritan <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> It made me go balf, rofl. I was actually the limit of complaints they got, and they are now forced to mark it on their package now. It made me go bald for like 6 months <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/frowning.png?v=3" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>[me=jme_009]&lt;3's the Crispy clean Canadian air <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> :D[/me]</p>

              <p>I'm in Powder Springs. I don't know if it's the pollen, because I usually only sneeze inside in the morning and at night.</p>

<p>I hate the medicine because it's like freaking clockwork. Exactly an hour after taking, I get superrr tired. Like so tired when I move my eyes my eyesite has to catch up with them. But even though I'm so tired, I CAN'T FREAKING SLEEP. It drives me crazy. One time I took one before bed, needless to say I was a zombie for the rest of the night.</p>
