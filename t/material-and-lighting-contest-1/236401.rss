    <title>Material and Lighting Contest #1</title>

    <description>
Another one to start us off. I&#39;ve created a little scene. Contestants must come up with their own textures, materials, and lighting set up to properly show off the scene.

Here&#39;s how it goes. If you&#39;re competing, post here. Otherwise, don&#39;t. And if you&#39;re competing, post first to say that you are joining and then edit that post to add your final renders. You can change them as much as you want until the deadline. The deadline is October 16th.

Here&#39;s the rules.
You MUST have two renders, both 1280x1024 and one from each camera in the scene.
You CAN&#39;T move the camera. Or edit it&#39;s settings.
Materials must be your own work. No downloading materials for this. That teaches you nothing. Getting a texture for your material is different, however.
You CAN&#39;T move around any of the existing furniture.
You CAN add your own around it if your render calls for it. Also feel free to add little decorations onto the giant case in the back of the room.


Other:
You can do anything you want with the lighting. Night shot, day shot, etc. Some lamps and fixtures are provided but you can totally not have them on. That is up to you. Same with the materials. Your call on everything.
Keep post processing to a minimum. No filters or crazy effects. But adjusting white balance and levels etc. is fine.
Any renderer will do.
Some of these models aren&#39;t my work but are free for this use.
Have fun.

Voting will commence after the deadline or all entrants post their final images and agree they&#39;ve done their best.

Here&#39;s the scene in .c4d and .3ds

<p>Yea. My main computer has been broken as of late and I haven’t been able to get a replacement hard drive.</p>
<p>Anyway, Frell, it looks nice, just a few little things, like the windows having a gray background, it doesn’t really look like that’s where the light’s coming from. Other than that, I like it. What did you use to render? VRay?</p>

<p>Also, does DoF fall under “crazy filter effects”?[/quote]</p>
<p>No. I don’t know about that though. Because DoF should be done via renderer and camera settings. And the two cameras I have set up in the scene are in a position that there shouldn’t be DoF unless you’re using an unreal aperture.</p>
