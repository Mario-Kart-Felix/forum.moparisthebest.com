    <title>[REP++] 634 Items Class 8 for 317 Client - EASY [REP++]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rep-634-items-class-8-for-317-client-easy-rep/399616</link>
    <description>Hey all.

After many previous attempts of using the search bar to find a solution for this, I have given up, and now I&#39;ve come to this thread.

The title explains it all really. I&#39;m in need of a class8.java for a 317 client, that has all of the ints for 634 items. Whoever gives me the file first gets Rep++. I don&#39;t mind how you give it to me. You can either post a reply on this thread, or personal message me.

Thanks in advance!
