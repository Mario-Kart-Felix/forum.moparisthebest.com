&lt;blockquote&gt;Following a call to arms yesterday, the masses inhabiting the anonymous 4chan boards have carried out a huge assault on a pair of anti-piracy enemies. The website of Aiplex Software, the anti-piracy outfit which has been DDoSing torrent sites recently, is currently down having been DDoS’d. They are joined in the Internet wasteland by the MPAA’s website, also currently under huge and sustained attack.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

The majority of consumers don’t give a shit about artistic quality. Market value represents how many people like a song, and it only makes sense that the music industry should judge bands in this way. Why should certain original and artistic songs be promoted if hardly anyone likes them?<br>

</aside>
<p>The next big hit for Dutch copyright ‘protectors’: charge everyone who has a radio turned on in their shop/workplace/wherever because they ‘use it as a tool to satisfy customers, which justifies a fee!’ Or what about this: Charge every consumer, including children, that puts a homemade video on YouTube containing a song €130,-!</p>
<p>I’m not primarily pirating music because it’s free, it’s also a form of saying fuck you to those assholes who try to milk every song and every movie, while the artists get nothing. To back that statement: In 2009 Videma (responsible for copyrights of movies) collected €19,4 million, of which only €6,3 million went to the artists. Now that’s a hefty markup.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/speljohan">@Speljohan</a>: I too find the whole piracy scene a big pile of overreacting crap, especially those ‘Pirate parties’. Even for a one-issue party they are too narrow-minded, and unable to make a statement. Luckily, they didn’t get a seat in our Parliament. But until the music industry finds a way to distribute their music in a fair way, and stops judging a band on their market value and not on their artistic quality, I won’t buy any music from big labels. And I doubt that day will ever come.</p>

<p>Difference of opinion I guess. $1 seems incredibly cheap to me. You seem to forget that the artists have to eat.</p>
<p>Beatport is closer to $2 a track and I always considered that reasonable, although they had Wave + 320kb MP3 from day 0 and never ever had restrictions on what you could do with music, because their target audience is DJs who I assume are more conscious of music purchases vs. average consumer given that its their living or w/e</p>

Course you are. iTunes music is DRM free, as are most digital download stores now, at least the big ones.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

<p>Since when?  They did used to be DRM restricted didn’t they?[/quote]<br>
If they are DRM free now then it couldn’t have happened that long ago. Itunes had DRM-riddled music for ages.</p>

<p>the only reason speljohan is saying to buy software is because he supports indie games.<br>
[/quote]i couldnt care less about games cos it is easy to make features that only work with internet validation, but music is a completely different story.</p>

</aside>
<p>Of course – just look at what Ubisoft was subject to when they released Assassin’s Creed 2. :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Sure they can do it, but thankfully there’s such a negative stigma surrounding such approaches that many companies should either overlook the idea or back down on it before release.<br>
[/quote]How is that even relevant to what i said? There are plenty of good ways to make non-annoying DRMs that cannot be cirumvented.</p>

<p>You must know something none of the top game producing programmers know, since all they can make is annoying DRMs that can easily be circumvented.</p>
<p>There isn’t any protection that can be made that can’t be circumvented.<br>
[/quote]server-side features… but they generally dont do this cos they live in countries where bandwidth costs more money than gold<br>
[/quote]because you can’t reverse engineer the game and remove validation, or make your own auth server<br>
[/quote]i said server-side FEATURES. this would involve writing their own server software altogether, resulting in players not being part of the official community.[/quote]<br>
For a single player game like Assassin’s Creed, there’s no real value in being ‘part of a community’. In fact, I think the majority of people wouldn’t bother.<br>
At the end of the day, they just want the game.</p>

I’d probably consider iTunes cards if the songs were valued at $0.20 - $0.30 each.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>haha you cheap cunt :D[/quote]<br>
Maybe. I just don’t believe that media such as music should have the price tag that it does.<br>
$1 per song is a bit expensive, especially when you aren’t free to do what you please with it.</p>
