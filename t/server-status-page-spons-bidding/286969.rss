    <title>Server Status Page Spons Bidding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-status-page-spons-bidding/286969</link>
    <description>Ok, this time round i am planning to buy a sponsor server, i just wanted to clarafy a few thing&#39;s, i have bidded $65 and i seem to be the 1. Bidder, so i&#39;m sure i&#39;ll get the sponsor.
But i wanted to know a few things.

When they add me to the sponsor list, will they automatically add it under my name, becasue it seems another user as posted my vps ip adress with his name as owner, and when applying i pusted that same IP that the other user has put..

Will i get this account as the onwer? or will this resolve in compilcations?
Just curious.</description>

Your paying an outrageous amount of money a <span class="bbcode-b">month</span> for it so mitb would be more than happy to help you. (Thats what I would do).</p>
<p>How rich are you??</p>
