    <title>The system cannot find the path specified</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-system-cannot-find-the-path-specified/491926</link>
    <description>I just downloaded a blank source, because im a brand new coder. I want to learn how to code so I figured a blank source would be best. I tried to run the new source and I got a &quot;the system cannot find the path specified on both the &quot;run&quot; and the &quot;compiler&quot;. I already changed the &quot;jdk&quot; to &quot;jdk-7u15&quot; which is the java that my computer has, its up to date, i just downloaded it maybe 3 hours ago. What do I do with this? Im sure there is a way to fix it.</description>

              <p>ok, well first of all the ‘path’ means where the file you are trying to open will be running from.<br>
look for your java file in your computer files.</p>
<p>heres what to do :</p>
<p>my runserver looks like this<br>
“C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\Jre7\bin\Java.exe” -Xmx512m -cp .;./jython.jar;./MySql/mysql-connector-java-3.0.08-ga-bin.jar server</p>
<p>do you see at the beggining?<br>
“C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\Jre7\bin\Java.exe”</p>
<p>thats the path. so what you need to do is open your runserver.bat on notpad and change the path</p>
<p>how to know what the path is supposed to be?<br>
"C:\Program Files (x86)<br>
in the path file you see that right?<br>
that is where your java file is located. if its not in your “Program Files (x86)” folder, change that part of the path to :<br>
"C:\Program Files</p>
<p>next is inside your java file, you will see a new file with the version of your java as the name<br>
EX: Jre7</p>
<p>so in the path where it sais<br>
\Java\Jre7<br>
change the Jre7 to your version of java.</p>
<p>same thing if you use jdk, except its different file names.</p>
