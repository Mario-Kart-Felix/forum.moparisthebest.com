    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/save-youtube-videos-download-to-your-hard-drive/374108</link>
    <description>You&#39;re probably looking for a solution to playing your FLV Files and I&#39;ve put together some reviews and download links to help you out there. 

First off let me just point out a FLV file is a &#39;Flash Video File&#39;. Flash video is the most popular option for streaming videos to people. Youtube.com and sites like that have made it mega-popular. It&#39;s good quality and can stream in a fashion where the viewer can jump to part of the video or let it buffer.

Hands down, the best (and free) solution for playing FLV files is a program called *. If you want to save yourself the time in reading reviews - just click the big download button below. 

The internet has led to resurgence in animation, largely thanks to Macromedia&#39;s Flash format. This nifty program extends the capabilities of Youtube Video Download Flash player, allowing you to rewind and fast-forward though Flash-based movies. Supporting SWF file format, it provides the ability to resize and watch videos in full-screen mode. The features worked well with all the videos we tested. If you&#39;re a Flash movie fan, you might want to give this program a try. It works for more than just YouTube. You can use FLV Player.</description>
