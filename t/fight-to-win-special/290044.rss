This took me a long time. At least 1h 15m to do because the tut was so long. At the end, I had exactly 50 layers when I usually have about 15-20.
I was following a tutorial until I was about 3/4 through, that&#39;s when things weren&#39;t turning out right so I went from there with adding my own things.

              <p>I really like it for some reason. I just wish people would think bigger, there’s alot of potential here and people should stop sticking to the small dimensions of a signature and express themselves with a large piece.</p>

              <p>My problem with it, is that it looks like 3 seperate images stuck together.<br>
The left side is light, the middle slightly darker and the right side is very dark and gloomy. That creates the effect that the two sides are in front of the main figure which is not good.</p>
<p>It really shows you gived up 3/4 way through the tutorial.</p>
