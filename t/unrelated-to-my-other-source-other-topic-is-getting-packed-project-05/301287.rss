    <title>Unrelated to my other source [other topic is getting packed] -- Project &#39;05</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unrelated-to-my-other-source-other-topic-is-getting-packed-project-05/301287</link>
    <description>Well, you might have heard me talk about Project &#39;05 by now. If not, then, it&#39;s a project I&#39;m working on with a few of the friends I&#39;ve gained on here; Notably 0mg Noob.

Anyways, I was wondering...

How do I &quot;Add&quot; quests on Devo v2.7?

Like, Questhandler for the interfaces and information, yes, but I mean the actual updates of it. How would I make it update if people complete part a, then go to part b?

Then comes in the text of NPCs to say stuff when you&#39;re at part b, for example. At part a they say nothing special, but at part b, they say something important.
And then just text of NPCs in general. Like what to do next...
And when the quest is all over, give quest points?

--IMPORTANT Q FOR MY FRIEND: How does he make [code]&quot;QP:&quot; +tqp[/code] work? He tries and gets errors compiling; cannot find symbol.

I&#39;m new to coding this Devo shit, so, any and all help appreciated.
Don&#39;t say &quot;You basically want to be spoonfed quests.&quot; or some shit like that, cuz I HONESTLY have no freakin&#39; clue what to do.
I&#39;d rather donate $300 to people to help out, but for now, it&#39;s just me and Blake, and hopefully more people sooner or later.

SO: Any help on quests?
