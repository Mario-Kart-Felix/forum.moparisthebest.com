    <title>Mac Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mac-client/547858</link>
    <description>Hello, I am working on my rsps and I decided to make it online for friends to test.

I got the porting and all that working, my friends on windows PCs can use the client but whenever one of my friends who has a mac tries to open the client he just gets a grey screen.

I redirected the cache to work for macs aswell and when I run the client through the terminal it shows the cache loading the same way as windows but when the cache is done loading the client stays on a grey screen.

If anyone has any advice to help me fix this problem that would be amazing.

Thanks in advance.</description>
