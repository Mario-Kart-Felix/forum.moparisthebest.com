    <title>RS Story</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs-story/333282</link>
    <description>I started out runescape as a noob and was stuck on tutorial island for like a week. Then i finally found out how to turn on the &quot;Run&quot; button, yeah it may seem funny but that was the beginning of this epic failed time i had in runescape.

When i finished the tutorial i started out woodcutting for cash, since then it has been my favourite skill. I had woodcutted around 1hour a day and trained combat and other skills. I used to dream about runescape at school, never studied and still got Good grades.

When i got my PC i was told by my parents that if i had a drop in Grades my PC will dissapear. So i had to concentrate to the Max at School, Whilst at home playing runescape for 6hrs a day and then sleeping, waking up at 6am and playing for 2hrs before going school.

My Timetable:-
6:00: Wake up
6:00-6:05: Brush teeth &amp; get ready for the day
6:05-8:00: Nerd RuneScape.
8:00-15:30: Do school whilst thinking of woodcutting.
15:30-24:00: Nerd RuneScape followed by 6hours of sleeping.

After a while i soon found a way to get Members although my parents didnt let me :(. I would wake up at 6am and buy members via Phone and put the cash it costed in my Mum&#39;s Wallet. Lol?

Anyways, after i had become a member i had like a quite high woodcutting level and like a combat of 70. I made 8m in my first week, but then got scammed since i had no idea what these phising sites were. I felt really upset... All that hard woodcutting went to waste.

Then, i found out my neighbour plays runescape to so he and me started playing together. I was always 1 step ahead of him and still am. (Me = 111cb 2 99s, He = 105cb no 99s) We always told each other the secrets of this game. I and he learnt alot during this peroid.

Soon, I had made another 8m and finally wanted to grab a skillcape, I was depressed because people lower Combat levels had trimmed skillcapes. Within 4months i started and got 99 in the Skill Cooking. I was happy and had a fail of a party. But i was happy since everyone who played with me alot was there.

After this i started doing some quests with my neighbour whilst woodcutting 1hr a day. I had also been scammed of 11m during this period, and helped countless people, [Also saved like 20+ from getting scammed]. I and my neighbour also promised to each other we wont quit till were maxed out.

Soon, I did Desert Treasure and did abit of magic. I used to Teleport to &quot;Camelot&quot; with Autoclicking... Lol? Yeah its a retarded idea. I got like 10 levels from it [63-73] and stopped after reliasing i lost over 4m from doing it... At that time i started playing private servers on &quot;Silab&quot;s client, like 1hr a day when i got fustrated from RuneScape.

After a while my close friend (not neighbour) got Moderator Status. I was not happy for him though because he did the following during the same time which i played:- Botted, Use of Glitches, Scammed over 300m+ from people, Advertised websites &amp; many more I cant remember of. I thought to my self &quot;This Game is F**KING B***S****&quot; i was so fustrated after all my work i wasnt even recognised.

Very soon i got a Mod friend, Which was going for 99wcing at the time, After she achieved it i started playing runescape for 10hrs a day and even bunking off school and shortly i achieved it. Very soon after I reliased i had lost over 30m since i started this game and now had 8m.

I always wanted a GodSword and always will... This game has taught me to deal with life and how to treat others. I during this period got muted for talking to people at &quot;Varrock&quot; in f2p helping them gain levels, obtaining more items and teaching them some tips on how to improve.

I had now reliased i had wasted over £30 on membership status and reliased i&#39;d call it quits. So i started playing RuneScape Private Servers. Soon i reliased if i was to achieve my goal, I would set back to RuneScape asap. I would not like to F**K over a Promise for a R*****DED game. When i came back i found out that i could lend peoples items and also shortly went to soulwars. I used to camp like a B***H in corners whilst putting a Beer Glass on my Camera Movement Keys.

This way i gotten my mage from 80-85. Soon i would high alch and lose another 4m from doing this. Then i started merching, failed over 3m and quit merching. I reobtained my 8m by my hard work and am currently f2p looking for a good method to make cash to come back.

-- Former RS Addict a.k.a Me. lol?
