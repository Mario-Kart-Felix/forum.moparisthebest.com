    <description>Beyond The Law
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103805/
[img]http://ia.imdb.com/media/imdb/01/I/72/08/73m.jpg[/img]

This movie is a true story about cop Daniel Saxon (played by Charlie Sheen) who goes undercover in The Jackels, a biker gang, filled with drug pettlers, rapists, and murderers like all biker gangs. It&#39;s a Crime Drama and to a lot of people I have talked to most have said &quot;It was a great fuckin movie!&quot; :)

There is a good amount of action and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. The constant thoughts of [i]is he going to get caught? is he going to jail? will he die?[/i] comes from Charlie Sheen&#39;s great acting. If you haven&#39;t seen it or choose not to see it, then man you are missing out. 

If you don&#39;t feel like renting it then you can download it on your comp via torrents.
