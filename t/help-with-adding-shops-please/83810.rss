    <description>Ok well I&#39;ve been playing private servers for awhile but started to copy and paste yesterday and it actually started to make a little sense :P So im using NarbScape atm and i wanted to just try to test this out by placing a npc in the lair and have it be a store aswell. Im pretty sure the files i wanna open are NPChandler.java and Shops.cfg . I was looking through it and still have no idea how half of these shops got there because i dont know what 
[code]shop = 11[/code]
or how to even get the i.d. So if someone can help me from step 1 to finish on how to add a store. Can you please add me on msn at Refind@programmer.net  ? Thanks! :D
