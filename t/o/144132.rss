    <description>Thank you for contacting RuneScape Customer Support regarding this sensitive issue.

We are very sorry that you are upset over the current status of your account. We would hate to thing of anyone hurting themselves over our game.

After careful investigation we can see that you were in control of the account at the time the offences where committed. We can see no reason to remove any of these offences from your account.

We understand that you may have some issues in your life that are affecting you, most of these you will not want to discuss with Jagex. The best thing for you to do would be to speak to someone about how you are feeling, speak to a parent/guardian, a teacher or another adult that you trust. We are sure that once they understand how you are feeling then they will be happy to help you.

If you still find you cannot tell any of the people mentioned above about your situation you can contact www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/. Here you will find lots of help, advice and information.

It is important to remember that RuneScape is only a game. There is a whole wide world out there and we would hate to think of you missing out on all of this because of our game.

Your account is currently on a last chance so you are free to play our game. You will be able to continue playing our game so long as you stick to our rules.

If you have any further questions or comments please do not hesitate to get back in touch with us.

Yours Sincerely

RuneScape Customer Support.</description>

<blockquote>Dear attackplease,
<p>Thank you for contacting RuneScape Player Support about your account.</p>
<p>We are sorry that you are upset over your account being banned but we would hope that you wouldn’t go so far as to hurt yourself over our computer game.</p>
<p>If you are having problems inside or outside of the game then please talk to somebody about them. You’ll often find that simply talking to another person that you trust can help you co0me to terms with your problems. Maybe your parents should be your first port of call.</p>
<p>If you have no one you can speak to about this then we would recommend you contact someone at the national suicide prevention life line, the number can be found on <a href="http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Please remember that our game (although fun) isn’t life defining. There’s a big world out there and we wouldn’t want you to miss any of it due to a computer game.</p>
<p>You are more than welcome to create a new account with which to play Runescape. We can assure you that, you will not have any action taken against you if you stick to the rules and play the game in a fair and considerate way.</p>
<p>The rules can be found through the “Rules” link on the RuneScape homepage (<a href="http://www.runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.runescape.com</a>), under the ‘Knowledge Base’ section on the left hand side of the page. Take good note of these rules so that we need never have this situation occur again.</p>
<p>I hope that you take what has been said on board and become the great player that I know you are capable of being.</p>
<p>Please contact us again if you have any more problems or issues that you’d like to talk about.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely</p>
