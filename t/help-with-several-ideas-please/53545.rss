    <description>custom combat help:
can someone give me a tut on making the exp setup for a level system that levels your combat level and choose wich stats you wish to boost.

example:

you are combat level 1, you gain 1000 exp, you are now level 2 so you get 10 &quot;stat edit&quot; points. you can use these points to increase your atk def str hp magic range or prayer (each level you get more stat points to use) and possibly make it to where kills give exp instead of hits.

Mana instead of rune setup help:

 could someone maybe make the special bar or something a mana bar for mageing spells (a tut would be nice)

marking off land:

 could I get a tut on how to fence off certain areas that can only be accessed by people of a certain level or beat a certain &quot;boss&quot;

healing spells:

 could you convert maybe a prayer or something into a healing magic spell (tut needed if yes plz)

elemental defences: 

 could someone also give me a tut on how to make an elemental defence setup where if you have 200% of a certain stat you get healed by that type of attack.

death spell:

need tut on how to make a spell that has a chance to instant kill a player, and a stat to gaurd against it 

so i hope i didn&#39;t ask to much yet, i still have a bunch of crap i need help with.

 ty for the help  ;D</description>

<p>is there a file that sets how high the spells hit so that you can set it so high, or so low that it heals someone instead of hurt them, prolly just have to make a knive that heals or sumthin.</p>

              <p>aight, that sounds like fun, lol : P</p>
<p>what bout fenceing, and a gate that will only open for lvl such and such, and set the monsters to give xp on the kill rather than the hit, then i could have a “boss” that gave just enough exp to get them to the needed level, or they could kill a bunch of low xp monsters</p>

<p>ty for trying to help though :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Where you can walk and where you can’t isn’t handled in the client file. It’s handled in the Player file. other than that, you’re thinking about this wrong: There are no ‘elemental spells’, ‘bosses’, or ‘stats’. They are all just a bunch of numbers. If you want someone to ‘kill a boss’, they have to change stat 3 on the NPC with the ID of the ‘boss’ to 0. If they aren’t damaged by an elemental spell, then their 3rd stat doesn’t change. Stat edit points are the same deal: skills[index] += statdiff. Think of it as all numbers, and then you’ll realize all the things you can do.</p>
