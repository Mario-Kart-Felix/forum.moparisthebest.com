    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-3-problems-i-need-to-fix-508/330627</link>
    <description>1. My Noted items dont work, they stay noted even after i put them in
the bank and all, they dont even come out as notes when i do the
&quot;Withdraw Noted&quot; bank option... or whatever its called... Anyone who knows
how to fix that please post! :D

-----------------------

2. How do i make it so that i can sell any item to shops, like making it a general store,
because right now my shops can only sell, If you could, please include Buying
options, my only say &quot;value, buy, examine&quot;.

-----------------------

3. Problem with trading options, I followed gravediggah&#39;s tutorial on full trading completely,
and i can&#39;t trade by like &quot;offer 10, offer 5, offer x, offer all&quot; does not work....
i need to know how to make it so those things work..


Edit: Forgot a Problem!</description>
