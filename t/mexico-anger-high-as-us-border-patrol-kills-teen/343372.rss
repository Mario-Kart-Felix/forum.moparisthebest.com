    <title>Mexico Anger High As Us Border Patrol Kills teen</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mexico-anger-high-as-us-border-patrol-kills-teen/343372</link>
    <description>Basically some border patrol shot a teen who was in the country illegally and they were trying to detain him, who claim that It was in self-defense (which I could care less if it was or not). I think more shit like this should happen. If these fucking wetbacks know that they will get their ass shot coming across the border I think they would be smart enough to stop, else it will eliminate stupid motherfuckers with no common-sense. Opinions on this? Comments from people in North-America who are victims of these mother-fuckers killing our economy and our country are welcomed, all else who do not know where im coming from who want to flame me, your a fail-troll.

              <p>As of know, it has been said that Mexico’s economy is one of the best handled but yet the most corrupt. That’s why Mexico is so fucked up and has gotten a bad reputation thus making less opportunities for them. Also, most states near a shore are going to sue BP for damage to their beaches and stuff</p>

Or to sell all of their possessions in mexico. It costs about $1000 to gain citizenship.</p>
<p>They will also blame the US government for ripping apart their families, when, they come here illegally and have kids who are legal citizens and cannot be deported with the parents.</p>

<p>So to act as a role-model, you must do everything you can to stop people who try to live the ‘American dream’? America sees itself as a wealthy nation, but what is wealth worth when you can’t share it?</p>

<p>Regarding the ‘American-dream’ bit: They don’t call it the American dream for nothing. If it was for the Mexicans then they’d call it the Mexican dream, or something else along those lines.</p>

<p>But you see, a while ago when the US needed citizens they propagated the ‘american dream’ around the world. America was the land of opportunity, of hope etc… Everybody was welcome. And now?<br>

<p>Actually no. Many companies take advantage of illegal immigrants by making their salaries MUCH lower than what it normally is, sometimes even less than minimum wage, and since they’re technically not Americans its easy for companies to get away with something like this. Its illegal for companies to hire illegal immigrants for that reason (or any reason at all i think), but they still do because of the profit.<br>

</aside>
<p>No, not that. Its just giving illegals more priority over actual American citizens who could qualify for the job even better.<br>

<p>So to act as a role-model, you must do everything you can to stop people who try to live the ‘American dream’? America sees itself as a wealthy nation, but what is wealth worth when you can’t share it?</p>

Actually no. Many companies take advantage of illegal immigrants by making their salaries MUCH lower than what it normally is, sometimes even less than minimum wage, and since they’re technically not Americans its easy for companies to get away with something like this. Its illegal for companies to hire illegal immigrants for that reason (or any reason at all i think), but they still do because of the profit.[/quote]Yeah, death to capitalism!</p>
