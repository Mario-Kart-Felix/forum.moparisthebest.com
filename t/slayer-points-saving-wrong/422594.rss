    <title>Slayer Points Saving Wrong</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/slayer-points-saving-wrong/422594</link>
    <description>I was wondering how do I fix this.

When I open a char file it saves the slayerpoints as: slayPoint 0 it needs to save as slayPoints = 0 . Any ideas? Also, how do I give the items in my slayer shop A certain price?


From my limited Java experience I&#39;m guessing this is the code that handles doing that. See anything wrong with it?

[code]                        characterfile.write(&quot;slay-points = &quot;, 0, 12);
                        characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.slayPoints), 0, Integer.toString(p.slayPoints).length());
                        characterfile.newLine();[/code]


EDIT: I fixed the first part. I had to change 12 to 14.</description>

<p><code>                        characterfile.write("slay-points = ", 0, 12);
                        characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.slayPoints), 0, Integer.toString(p.slayPoints).length());
