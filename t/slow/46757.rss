I was so excited, I logged in for the first time  this morning, it was cool, But when i came back from school it took at least 20 minutes to load, Then a extra 2 minutes per click. I figured it was someone else&#39;s computer so i told them it was probably their computer, but its not. It happened to me to.

And, It also always says my account is logged in, i restarted server like 4 times, logged of Hamachi 4 times i tried everything[br][size=1]Posted on: January 11, 2007, 06:09:27 PM[/size][hr]Sorry bout double post, but its been 4 hours...</description>
