    <title>2 Attacking Errors</title>

    <description>Attacking Error
1) OK, when I use a melee weapon and attack a player, it hits them. Then when they walk away, my character doesn&#39;t follow them and they still get damaged. My character doesn&#39;t move, and still they get damaged even if they are far away. Does anyone know how to solve this?

2) [b]Sometimes[/b] when I click to attack somebody, it does the hitting emote but the other player doesn&#39;t get hit at all. I have to wait a few seconds then click on them again for it to attack properly. Why is this?</description>
