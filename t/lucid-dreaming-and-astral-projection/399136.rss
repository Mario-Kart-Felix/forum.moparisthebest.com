    <title>Lucid Dreaming and Astral Projection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lucid-dreaming-and-astral-projection/399136</link>
    <description>Does anyone have any experience with either of these?

My experiences with lucid dreaming always become apparent when I check my hands in the dream. Its something I do all the time so when I do it in my dreams I realize that I am dreaming and become lucid. Everyone of my lucid dreams always ends with me about to start flying :(

My astral projection experience is non-existent and im still sceptical to if it exists.</description>

What the hell? I just looked lucid dreaming up: I always know I’m dreaming WTF. Are you seriously so stupid you don’t know that you’re dreaming? o.O</p>
<p>Okay looked up astral projections, I can do that anytime I want lol… like if I looked at a corner and closed my eyes I could see and move around the corner and know exactly what everything looks like from that “camera”<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>If you have an I.Q. &gt;5 you should be capable of knowing when and when you’re not dreaming. Lucid dreaming is being able to control your actions in a dream, which you aren’t able to do when you’re normally dreaming. Try them both and see the difference.[/quote]I can always control what I do in a dream lol. That’s why it’s “my dream”?</p>

<p>If you have an I.Q. &gt;5 you should be capable of knowing when and when you’re not dreaming. Lucid dreaming is being able to control your actions in a dream, which you aren’t able to do when you’re normally dreaming. Try them both and see the difference.</p>

              <p>This is a very interesting concept, however I think astral projection is more of a religious-based act more than a general one. I had a few lucidical dreams here and there and I got to admit they are very unique as every each one is different. There is actually a forum entirely based on these dreams, however I will not post the link as I do not wish to advertise it.</p>

<p>Oh then that experience I had defiantly wasn’t lucid. Tell you what though, I can go back to sleep and dream about the same dream easily.</p>
