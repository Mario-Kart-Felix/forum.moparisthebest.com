    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m co owning a server. This kid keeps coming in and hacking, turning into a mine cart and spawning items. I ip ban him but he gets around with changing his ip. Is there anyway I can keep this kid ip banned? Like a code that blocks somehow all proxies?</description>

              <p>I’ve figured it out. He was a really nice guy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">   I sat down and talked to him about him hacking and he told me what packets to block and what steps to take to prevent all of this… Idk whether or not to trust him but he sounded legit.</p>
