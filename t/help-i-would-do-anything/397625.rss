    <title>Help! i would do anything!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-i-would-do-anything/397625</link>
    <description>Okay guys, this is what i want to know:

What is the system where you create an account on the website and that account details is the server login?
Like if you go to a Rsps webclient you can make an account by just login in but i want it so that you have to create account on the website first and then you sign in with that details.

For example: http://www.innovationx.org/

also, On smffy forums how do you create a home page?

Does anybody know? Please contact me or leave comment below ASAP, Thanks - King
