    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/developing-in-mopar/162162</link>
    <description>I&#39;m advanced w/ java etc... Now my question is... I see all these narb questions asking &#39;how to make f cape drop less&#39; how to cycle between male and female.. etc... blah blah blah...

Now to me these are stupid questions as I&#39;ve done crap like this w/ API before and plenty of times.

Now what I need to know is where is the code that gives me the packages of mopar? Just like java... http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/ - It has the packages, and then it has util, etc. in it. Where is this for mopar?</description>

<p>mopar doesnt bother to make APIs for his client due to the fact he doesnt make it open sourced and i suppose you could learn from a open sourced client</p>

It’s usually HTML and still have yet to see it in the mopar directory… So is there one or not?</p>

You see all these stupid questions can be answered with API. If you call this command for example…</p>
<p>import javax.swing.*;</p>
<p>That is a package -</p>
<p>You then can view the docs of the PACKAGE and then it’ll supply a line of info that’ll tell you what packages can be extended, etc. It is very useful and if you don’t have it, it’s a waste of time to even bother w/ ‘moparscape’.</p>
<p>I’m surprised if there is no API any ‘real’ java programmers stuck around here. Apparently not it seems…</p>

              <p>I’m advanced w/ java etc… Now my question is… I see all these narb questions asking ‘how to make f cape drop less’ how to cycle between male and female… etc… blah blah blah…</p>
<p>Now to me these are stupid questions as I’ve done crap like this w/ API before and plenty of times.</p>
<p>Now what I need to know is where is the code that gives me the packages of mopar? Just like java… <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/</a> - It has the packages, and then it has util, etc. in it. Where is this for mopar?</p>
