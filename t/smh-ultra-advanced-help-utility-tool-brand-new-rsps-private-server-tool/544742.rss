    <description>[center]WAITING FOR BANNER[/center]


[center][size=12pt]SMH is the newest innovation in RSPS, providing high quality support for private server owners everywhere. SMH is a professionally made program by our team of intuitive and highly skilled programmers. Our goal is help server owners troubleshoot their RSPS problems as soon as possible, without the need of an internet connection if the circumstances are called upon, waiting is not an option and their server(s) economies for example are in jeopardy, or a help community is simply unavailable at the time. [/size]
[size=18pt][b]CURRENT SMH STATUS[/b][/size]
[size=12pt]As of this moment, the program is 100% free, and SMH 8.0 is in the Alpha stage and NOT ready to be tested by the community.[/size]

[size=12pt]Our team works rigorously to make sure SMH is bug free and meets our own standards, as well as fulfilling our clients&#39; needs to help them get through any troubles they have while running, servicing, or setting up their private servers.

Here is some proof that we are INDEED working on a new version SMH, in this case SMH 8.0.
[code][hr]
[b]smh-batch-compiler[/b]

I was writing SMH v8.43 and during development I realized that the batch programming language needed a good modern compiler (the last stable compiler was by Intrango industries around 1999, unfortunately). I decided to tackle the issue using the language Java. Below I will show a sample of how to use the compiler, with the class files [i]main.class.cmd[/i] and [i]helper.class.cmd[/i].

&lt;blockquote&gt;java -jar smh-batch-compiler.jar compile bin/executable.cmd src/main.class.cmd src/help.class.cmd&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[i]src/main.class.cmd[/i]
[code=batch]// All new compiler commenting, which do not get parsed by the compiler!
// This is a main class.
:main
ECHO Welcome to the main class.
goto help[/code]

[i]src/help.class.cmd[/i]
[code=batch]:help
ECHO Welcome to help.
PAUSE[/code]

Output file, [i]bin/output.cmd[/i]
[code=batch]@echo off
REM Batch executable compiled by smh-batch-compiler.
goto main

:main
ECHO Welcome to the main class.
goto help

:help
ECHO Welcome to help.
PAUSE[/code]

<p>That’s not gunna fly, sorry. That’s not a tool, it’s a tutorial list download.

<p>But SMH wont only have these features, these were primal features only included by the careless previous owner who neglected SMH, but I will be adding new features, such as a command generator for example, and I am also developing an IDE made specifically for batch so updates and new features can be added to SMH as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Besides, there are no “tutorial lists” or links to tutorials.</p>

This program gives you the ease of access of having all of these tutorials in one simple program to use from the convenience of your desktop, for example, if you need some help for your server, and either the persons internet is down or moparscape is down, smh will be there as an offline support entity to help the user through his/her rsps endeavors.</p>

<p>But that batch file was the whole thing?.. And I am just going to add more features in 8.0, its not all tutorials it was written years ago by the person who passed it down to me and now I continue work on it. Everything is in this one batch file, making things a lot easier.</p>
