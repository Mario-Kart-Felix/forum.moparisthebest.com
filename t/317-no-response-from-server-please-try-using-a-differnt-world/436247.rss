    <description>I get this error only after the client has already connected to my TestScape based source once. I&#39;ve connected to the server manually (using a tool similar to telnet) and it logs an accepted connection.

I&#39;ve googled around a bit and found that this can be related to the client sending a UID? In my source, I check the client&#39;s UID to ensure that it&#39;s the one I&#39;ve put in my client - the one in the client does not change.

Do I need to let the client have a random UID? Do I need to clear a player object or client object / UID somewhere in the source?</description>

              <p>It turns out that I had another method in place that was denying the clients access to the server if they’re already connected yet didn’t clear their IP.</p>
<p>If you look in server.java, under:</p>
<p><code>while (true) {
	java.net.Socket s = clientListener.accept();</code></p>
<p>Anything that runs:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Or stops the code getting to some variation of:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Will cause the client to give that error.</p>
