    <title>Packet Editting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packet-editting/13636</link>
    <description>It has been said that when they first hacked Runescape classic it was by editting the incoming and outgoing packets.Some guy who calls himself xx jut xx says he has made Runbot (or whatever its called) that hacked runescape classic and allowing for female characters have beards , item duping , macroing , etc....
He says it all started when he wanted to connect to runescape with his 2nd computer.He then started runescape on his 2nd computer whilst being connected to his 1st computer and he noticed that all the packets of runescape , incoming and outgoing, were saved on his 1st computer.He then figured out he could edit the packets...and he did.Thats how they could attack bank npc&#39;s item duping and some things mentioned above.i&#39;m sure some of you people have heard of people attacking npc&#39;s or the great item duping chaos.ok ok il get to the point

My question is : Can we still edit the packets that we receive of runescape??
if so then what program do you need?i&#39;ve heard that PacketSniffer is a good one but all i see is some random numbers and letters...well , i guess its encrypted 
So plz someone help me with this .If this would work we could make RS history again ;D

(i dont know if this topic belongs to rs client hacking though  :P)</description>

              <p>It’s not that simple. They switch between little-endian and big-endian ints and scramble packet info, and other stuff like that. For example, let’s say in revision 423 the packet that sets the chats looks like this:</p>
<p><code>public chat (big-endian)
private chat (little-endian)
trades (little-endian)</code></p>
<p>The next revision, it might look something like this:</p>
<p><code>trades (little-endian)
public chat(little-endian)
private chat(big-endian)</code></p>
<p>So you’d need to do some extensive updating every time there’s an update. You’re a lot better off just making a normal bot.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>The page you’re talking about is a copy of Kaitnieks’s autorune history site. Packet editing programs (like AutoRune) are possible, but it was such a successful cheat back during Classic that Jagex put a lot of effort into killing it specifically.</p>
<p>First, there’s encryption (this didn’t exist when Kaitnieks wrote the first version of AutoRune).<br>
To interpret game commands, you have to have a special random number generator synchronized with the one the server is using (the packets come to your client scrambled). In order to synchronize your client’s number generators, you have to have the session keys. You can only get the session keys in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Intercept the login packet and crack RSA encryption.</li>
<li>Hack the client to output session keys.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first option is not practical. Although evo did maintain AutoRune for a long time and thus had to figure out a way around all this stuff, he was being paid lots of money to do so. No one has that kind of motivation at the moment. I think he modified a client to send the session keys to AutoRune rather than cracking the RSA, but that brings us to the next option.<br>
My point here is that if you’re already hacking the client, why bother with packets?</p>
<p>Second, Jagex changes the protocol slightly with every update - they randomly change the packet IDs and sometimes add bogus packets. The result is that the protocol works the same, but looks different. It’s possible to update a program to use new packet IDs. I guess it would be no more of a pain than writing an autoupdater for a modern java bot, but for a long time it would have been 10x harder than writing a java bot. So it became one of those “just isn’t done” things.</p>

              <p>It has been said that when they first hacked Runescape classic it was by editting the incoming and outgoing packets.Some guy who calls himself xx jut xx says he has made Runbot (or whatever its called) that hacked runescape classic and allowing for female characters have beards , item duping , macroing , etc…<br>
He says it all started when he wanted to connect to runescape with his 2nd computer.He then started runescape on his 2nd computer whilst being connected to his 1st computer and he noticed that all the packets of runescape , incoming and outgoing, were saved on his 1st computer.He then figured out he could edit the packets…and he did.Thats how they could attack bank npc’s item duping and some things mentioned above.i’m sure some of you people have heard of people attacking npc’s or the great item duping chaos.ok ok il get to the point</p>
<p>My question is : Can we still edit the packets that we receive of runescape??<br>
if so then what program do you need?i’ve heard that PacketSniffer is a good one but all i see is some random numbers and letters…well , i guess its encrypted<br>
So plz someone help me with this .If this would work we could make RS history again ;D</p>
<p>(i dont know if this topic belongs to rs client hacking though  :P)</p>
