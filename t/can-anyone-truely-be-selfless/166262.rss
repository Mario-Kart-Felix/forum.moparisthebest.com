    <title>Can anyone truely be selfless?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-truely-be-selfless/166262</link>
    <description>I was thinking once, that if my family were in a fire, i would kill myself to save them. And i was getting all cocky about being so caring , but then i realized, i was doing it because, of course they are my family and because i couldn&#39;t live with myself.

If i couldn&#39;t live with myself, i would be living in pain and i wouldn&#39;t want that , would I?
So i realized, because i didn&#39;t want to live in pain, i would save them.

DISCUSS!

Can anyone truely be selfless and how? and also, if somethings show as selfless, how they can really be selfish</description>

              <p>I was thinking once, that if my family were in a fire, i would kill myself to save them. And i was getting all cocky about being so caring , but then i realized, i was doing it because, of course they are my family and because i couldn’t live with myself.</p>
<p>If i couldn’t live with myself, i would be living in pain and i wouldn’t want that , would I?<br>
So i realized, because i didn’t want to live in pain, i would save them.</p>
<p>DISCUSS!</p>
<p>Can anyone truely be selfless and how? and also, if somethings show as selfless, how they can really be selfish</p>
