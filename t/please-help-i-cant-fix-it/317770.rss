    <description>Hey, I had a good server coming along and I was almost done, I just finished the skilling area and then... It randomly stopped working. Just look...

This is when I first start my server, everything looks fine here.

Im using Jspeced as my base, so 2 seconds after I start the server, this box comes up (server controlls)

After that server controll thing comes up this is what the Run box looks like

And this is when I try to log in..... (it does this on any client!)

Last pic... This is when I compile my server, no errors!

The server just freezes and nothing happens, the client works fine because I have tried other servers on it.
I really don&#39;t get it.... I tried earasing what i put before but that didn&#39;t work, plus that was just teleports and a shop.... If someone would help I would be extremely greatful  :)</description>
