    <title>Emerald Dream Client cannot connect</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/emerald-dream-client-cannot-connect/543847</link>
    <description>Every time I try to connect to this one server using any IP Address that I found in their decompiled client, it will not connect. I even tried using their no-ip link. I did the exact same for my RSPS and it connects almost instantly. The server I am trying to connect to is a PI server using Pkfast source.</description>
