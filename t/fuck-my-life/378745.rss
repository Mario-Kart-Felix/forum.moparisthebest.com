Besides that’s what you do when you’re too rich on F2P - other than buying 10 saradomin sets, that is (yes we really are pathetic, aren’t we?)</p>

<p>dragon isnt overpowered at all. besides, even if it IS the strongest metal armour in F2P, it runs out in like 30 mins, doesnt it?</p>
<p>go spend like 14m for 5 hrs of d long, not even combat time, just however long your logged in… if someone was to buy those and usem pking regularly, they would loose money… (any dragon pieces imo.)</p>
