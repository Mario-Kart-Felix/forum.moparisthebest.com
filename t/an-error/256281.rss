    <description>Well i was editing my item.cfg, i accidently saved something in the wrong format and came up with this 


[code]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ClassFormatError: Truncated
class file
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
        at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source)
        at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown So
urce)

)
        at PlayerHandler.&lt;clinit&gt;(PlayerHandler.java:26)
        at server.main(server.java:109)[/code]

Now it lets people log in, but automatically nulls and dis-conencts them.

Now i know what your all gonna say, READ THE ERROR, i have a few times,a solution i was going to do was upload my back-ups, but those are months old.

I thought of a few things-

The folder that the source is in has become broken.
Two, a file or files, have become corrupted, or out of format to the rest.
Three, I&#39;m missing something in the files i edited.


So yeah, i removed what i edited and still get the error, now this is with a delta source, help will be much appreciated and rewarding.</description>
