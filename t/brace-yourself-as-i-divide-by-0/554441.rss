    <title>Brace yourself as I divide by 0</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/brace-yourself-as-i-divide-by-0/554441</link>
    <description>So I broke the golden rule:

Don&#39;t divide by 0 or the universe will collapse! Or at least i tried to they say its impossible and i literally came up with this idea within 5 minutes because i was bored and felt like being random.
I&#39;m just asking for someone to poke a hole in this so we don&#39;t all get sucked into the sky or whatever. &lt;- lol

[Spoiler=My Understanding of 0.]
First off 0 is not nothing the argument is as 1 followed by nothing is 1 and 1 followed by 0 is 10.
[/Spoiler]

[Spoiler=My Understanding of division.]
My understanding of division is that it is a quantity separated evenly and assigned to groups 10 pizza&#39;s(Quantity)/2 Dorm&#39;s(Party) = 5 each. 

^ Actually I taught myself that while the other 1st graders were messing with addition I opened a math program and figured it out from the visual representation of all the answers.

^ Not particularly relevant.
[/Spoiler]

[Spoiler=The logic/Math/Solution.]
But 0 is a value and therefore signifies that whatever the 0 is in relation to does exist even if you don&#39;t have it.
q = 0
q/0 = The existence of whatever q represents. Because its not like you can throw a bottle of water out your window and it will poof out of existence because nobody possesses it anymore.
q*0 = The existence of whatever q represents. Now these statements are usually opposites however... As said before just because you don&#39;t have said object doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.

Also the return for both is the existence of the related object of q or in other words &quot;TRUE&quot; if it does &quot;FALSE&quot; if it doesn&#39;t accounting for things which don&#39;t really exist but still have a name that can be stuck behind q.

These statements are the same not only because of what was previously mentioned but the fact that things are not simply created from nothing or destroyed into nothing.

</aside>
<p>This is not an example of division, this is subtraction. And anything divided by 0 does not equal 0, it has no value, so the water bottle would simply hit the ground out of your window.</p>
<p>I didn’t read much else, but no you can’t divide by 0. It complicates our current understanding of maths too much, and kind of breaks some things (as majorr pointed out).</p>
<p>If I divide 10 by 5, i get 2. 2 times 5 would then be 10, simple.</p>
<p>This is saying that<br>
x / y = z<br>
And<br>
z * y = x</p>
<p>If I multiply 10 by 0, I get 0. Now, what do I put over 0 to give me back 10? Nothing, because every number that is x would also result in z being zero (if y was 0), and that causes a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>If I explained something wrong, it’s because I’m a pleb.</p>

<p>not sure how to explain it exactly, but the thing is about math is that a lot of it is theoretical, and it just doesn’t occur in nature. Like the lowest temperature possible being -273 celsius? Thats probably never been reached anywhere, it just doesnt happen, but thats irrelevant. 0 itself doesn’t really occur in nature afaik, no matter how big or small, whatever it is, its still there, if that even makes any sense.</p>

Well yeah the water bottle doesnt disappear, but the thing is you said

          <blockquote>
              <p>But you haven’t actually divided by 0 - all you’ve done is write “q/0” and claimed you have. In mathematics everything boils down to the axioms, which are rules that you are assuming to be true, such as a = a (as is equal to itself), and when people say “you can’t divide by 0”, they really mean “under the system of mathematics that we typically use, division by 0 is an <span class="bbcode-b">undefined</span> operation”. You can define a value all you like, but you are going to violate an axiom. Here’s a not exactly rigorous proof of that:</p>
<p>Division is defined as: if <span class="bbcode-i">ac = b</span>, <span class="bbcode-i">a = b/c</span>.</p>
<p>Now assume we can divide by 0 - which really means, we can divide any real number by 0 (a real number is either an integer or a number with a decimal point, like 0 or 2 or 0.9 or π).</p>
<p>This means that for every possible real number (here we’ll call any individual value <span class="bbcode-i">b</span>), there exists a real number a such that <span class="bbcode-i">a = b/0</span>.</p>
<p>From this follows that:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">a * 0 = b</span></p>
<p>Which leads to:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">0 = b</span></p>
<p>So according to this, the only real number is 0. Which is obviously false, so our initial assumption was wrong, and therefore we cannot divide by 0.</p>
