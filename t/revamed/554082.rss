Just went on it and it’s a pretty nice server I think this will become the new Ikov IMO</p>

<p>Mate if you’re saying that because it looks similar to Ikov, I assure you there are plenty of other servers out there with the same source. All servers are “leeches” of some sort but this is a big leech lmao. Their website even uses the same template as Ruse, with the same images saying “Support Ruse”. So far they have no unique in game content to make them different from other servers, and when I went on there was only 1 player online <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> Just saying it could really use some work before going public and doing advertising, promoting the server.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ll update advert this Friday when i’ve finished my revamp to address these comments.</p>
