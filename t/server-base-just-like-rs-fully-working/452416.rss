    <title>Server base JUST like rs fully working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-base-just-like-rs-fully-working/452416</link>
    <description>Is there a server base out there that is fully working?

I&#39;m not asking for crazy stuff like all quests or something, just these:

- Version 317.
- No custom items\models.
- Fully working combat.
- Fully working doors.
- Fixed clipping (NPC&#39;s and Players + Following)
- All or most skills.
- Magic autocasting.

That&#39;s all I need. If anyone knows of one that has all this, or most of it, can you please post a link?</description>

<p>To be completely honest, any base that you download that has a large amount of content will be full of bugs and issues. There’s practically nothing that’s a pure ready to host and you’ll be aye okay. What I can suggest you do is that you download a decent base that doesn’t have much content, you’re best off with Runesource or Hyperion, and one that has some content. From there you can look at how things are done in other servers and write your own system you see fit. If you don’t know much about programming this is the perfect opportunity to learn. At first using Hyperion may seem like a scurry thing to do, just go through it and you’ll be glad you worked on a base that’s clean and done properly. Go team venture.</p>

<p>A 317?<br>
Not too sure, there are alot of 317 servers I haven’t played. You might want to go looking in <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,488887.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a></p>
<p>And you may want to post this under private server discussion.(If anywhere’s allowed)</p>

You probably won't find a base with all the skills, or most, and they are all decent.
