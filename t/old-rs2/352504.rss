    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-rs2/352504</link>
    <description>Im missing old rs2 I mean after the RSC went to RS2, I suppose there no server that actually is like that now?

I was logging into RS today, First of all I went lost when I TOUGHT I was going to varrock, second My HP wasn&#39;t draining and I was hiting 15-20s with New lvl 3 account... Doesn&#39;t feel like RuneScape anymore.. After that I just thought FUCK it can&#39;t play this its just wierd when I expected RS.. Anyway There is 500 RSPS out ATM so im asking if there any server that comes closest to RuneScape as it was after the Switch.</description>

              <p>Can’t be done, no server that advance has been released yet, the only server to have done this the closest I would say is WorldScape by Ry he is pretty much the only person here that has a 2000 connection server that has real content added and is the closest to emulating the RS2 protocol.</p>
<p>NOTE: To those who will say Hyperion can do it, please tell me how many Hyperion based severs do you see being developed that have a lot of content added and can still hold 2000 players, most of the people who work on Hyperion are stupid and make crappy updates to the server until it turns into a WL.</p>
