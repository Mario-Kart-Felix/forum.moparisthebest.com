    <description>http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/DevBlog:Old_School_RuneScape_is_here_to_stay


&lt;blockquote&gt;Old School RuneScape has been running for over 3 months, so now is a good time to talk about our long term plans for the servers. Let’s cut to the chase: Old School RuneScape is here to stay!
Longevity – We’re committed to Old School RuneScape for the long term. We plan to run the service for many years to come.
Cost – When Old School RuneScape launched we said access would be included as part of membership for the first 6 months, and then we’d review the pricing. We’ve made that decision now, rather than wait for September… There will be no increase in cost for the foreseeable future and we aren’t planning to review the pricing again for at least the next year, if not much longer. You will be able to access both Old School and the main game for the price you are currently paying for membership.
Stability – We’re aware players are still being affected by sporadic server disconnects and connectivity issues, and are re-doubling our efforts to sort this out. We’re confident that in the coming weeks and months the various steps we’re taking will progressively improve connection stability.
Bots – We will continue our anti-bot work which has really been seeing results in the last month or so. Since expanding BotWatch’s reach into Old School over 90,000 additional bans have been made, an incredible number, which averages out around 1,800 bans a day. Let us be clear: this behaviour is not allowed in either main or Old School RuneScape!
Support – We will continue to support the game from a development and community perspective, continuing to evolve the service as directed by you the players. This includes the regular polls for feature updates, powered by ideas sourced from the community.
Mods Ash, MatK, Nexus, Reach and the rest of the team love working with the Old School community and are looking forward to many exciting times ahead.

              <p>They ruined ace of spades and it pisses me off so much. I remember in alpha when it was just a rifle and a randomly generated terrain… Now they have jetpacks? What they’ve done to that game in a short period is just the pattern they do to all of their games. It’s a simple, unique idea that is popular which they then make mass efforts to expand, which pisses off a large number of their playerbase. They’ve even re-released the old ace of spades. It’s literally been the complete runescape cycle in a few months.</p>

<p>Their failure to follow through with a release due to failed marketing is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It’s probably quite likely that their marketing fails because of their reputation for reneging on all of their would-be releases; that doesn’t mean that an actual product would fail to gain traction in the market.</p>

              <p>Oh, Stellar Dawn is dead.</p>
<blockquote>I wanted to personally let you know that we have taken the decision to pause the development of Stellar Dawn for the time being. 
<p>This very difficult decision was driven by the massive year we have ahead of us. We feel we need to focus our resources to ensure we stay true to our values of delivering only the highest quality game experiences.</p>
<p>I know this news will come as a disappointment to many but I want to stress that this is not a decision we have taken lightly. The Stellar Dawn team has achieved a great deal developing the game over recent years and should rightly be proud of their achievements; however, we believe that this temporary move is in the best interest of the studio as a whole.</p>
<p>I know that many of you have been following the games development loyally over recent years and, on behalf of the development team and Jagex Game Studios, I wish to thank each one of you for the support you have shown.</p>
<p>Rest assured that we will review the status of the Stellar Dawn project in the future so long as an appetite for the game remains. I hope Jagex can rely on your ongoing support.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

</blockquote>I was just saying; they abandon all their projects which don’t skyrocket through beta stages. They lost too much revenue from messing up runescape of the years. They don’t want to take development time working on something not so successful.

<p>EDIT: Also, they need to move away from the subscription model. Everybody else is and they’re being left behind as a result. There are just too many good FREE games out there now for new players to justify picking up one of the antiquated subscription model games.</p>

Only 21k people are playing right now, despite it being the American summer. I don’t think the game has much of a future.</p>
<p>I’m personally quite content just watching PK videos/commentaries occasionally - the video creator does the hard work (leveling strength/range to 99, getting items, doing quests) and I nostalgia++ by watching the resulting PK videos. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

I don’t see any problem with a small community.[/quote]jagex does. ‘funorb’ still has a community/paying members but they provide no maintenance/updates for that site whatsoever.</p>
<p>if the game does not strive to succeed in fulfilling their greedy demands, then they will abandon progress to the game (this is what users want, but jagex wants to update the game so it’s more modern and not actually old-school (fu<span class="bbcode-b"></span>ck logic, jagex doesn’t understand the game was perfect) content) and make some new type of site/game/something</p>

<blockquote>Old School RuneScape has been running for over 3 months, so now is a good time to talk about our long term plans for the servers. Let’s cut to the chase: Old School RuneScape is here to stay!
Longevity – We’re committed to Old School RuneScape for the long term. We plan to run the service for many years to come.
Cost – When Old School RuneScape launched we said access would be included as part of membership for the first 6 months, and then we’d review the pricing. We’ve made that decision now, rather than wait for September… There will be no increase in cost for the foreseeable future and we aren’t planning to review the pricing again for at least the next year, if not much longer. You will be able to access both Old School and the main game for the price you are currently paying for membership.
Stability – We’re aware players are still being affected by sporadic server disconnects and connectivity issues, and are re-doubling our efforts to sort this out. We’re confident that in the coming weeks and months the various steps we’re taking will progressively improve connection stability.
Bots – We will continue our anti-bot work which has really been seeing results in the last month or so. Since expanding BotWatch’s reach into Old School over 90,000 additional bans have been made, an incredible number, which averages out around 1,800 bans a day. Let us be clear: this behaviour is not allowed in either main or Old School RuneScape!
Support – We will continue to support the game from a development and community perspective, continuing to evolve the service as directed by you the players. This includes the regular polls for feature updates, powered by ideas sourced from the community.
Mods Ash, MatK, Nexus, Reach and the rest of the team love working with the Old School community and are looking forward to many exciting times ahead.
