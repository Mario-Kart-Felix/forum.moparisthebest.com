              <p>[quote=“blakeman8192”]The history is very hazy, as Kaitnieks and the other important places in the history of RSPS are now gone.</p>
<p>As far as we know, this is the first RS2 private server ever made: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/origrs2/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/origrs2/</a><br>
It was developed by wL, and it’s known commonly as the “winterlove” server base.</p>
<p>After that release, Daiki took it and through lots of research/development, made a multiplayer server called BlakeScape.<br>
BlakeScape is the grandfather of RuneScape private servers.</p>
<p>At that moment, things start to get blurry as dozens of programmers took the original BlakeScape and developed their bases off of it. The main release that emerged from the original BlakeScape was called MythScape. Wolf then took MythScape and built several versions of WhtieScape, which Xerozcheez then used to make Cheezscape. Cheezscape was the dominating server base in the 2007 era, the last version being Cheezscape 80. After this line of servers up to Cheezscape, they were split into three highly popular bases: Project 16, Testscape, and Dodian. Dodian didn’t emerge until later, and originally it was just Project 16 and Testscape for a long time. From Dodian came Devolution, and then DeltaScape (which is currently the most popular server base). From Testscape emerged Pimpscape, which has now died out for the most part.</p>
<p>This flow chart (which Graham made) explains it all well:<br>
<img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/9421/treek.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>If you’re wondering about how well I know this stuff, I’m responsible for the RuneFusion, RuneFusion Final Build, and Enkrona servers on that chart. Enkrona had several versions (2.5, 2.6, and 3.2 I believe were all released to the mainstream) that aren’t mentioned on this chart. Not to toot my own horn, but I’ve also been around RSPS for quite a while now.</p>
<p>Many people have made attempts to re-create the original server base (some examples in chronological order: RuneCore by me and Graham, rs2d by varek, rs2hd by Graham, Hyperion by Graham, 317serv by Yz85Racer, casey, and rs377d by me, Apollo by Graham which is not yet released, and I’ve developed several unreleased servers from scratch, including Osiris) with something more stable and efficient than BlakeScape, but most of them have either failed or their server bases have failed to gain mainstream attention. My theory is that their server bases are too complicated for a majority of programmers to use, and hopefully I’ll be solving this problem soon with an open-source server I’ve been working on in my spare time known as RuneSource. It’s meant to resemble the original BlakeScape, but be far more stable, scalable, and efficient.</p>
<p>You can see development on RuneSource here: <a href="https://svn.assembla.com/svn/runesource/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://svn.assembla.com/svn/runesource/</a><br>
I’d like feedback, by the way.</p>
<p>Also, my Osiris 508 server base may be coming out soon through MoparScape, which will be a huge push forward in the 508+ era.<br>
Hopefully that answers some of your questions! I’m glad to see genuine interest in our history. :P[/quote]</p>
<p>Also here are some dates</p>
<blockquote>late 2005/early 2006: kaitnieks was an active and thriving cheating community for runescape
same era: wL made his first server in order to test bots and learn about the protocol. it was single player and horribly coded
early 2006: daiki takes wL's source and makes it multiplayer, still a "proof of concept" with maybe a bit of support/interest for actually playing it, releases it under the name "blakescape d boosted"
same era: kaitnieks shuts down
soon after: mitb forms for the refugees of the death of kaitnieks, runescape cheating becomes centralized once more
soon after that: development continues by random individuals on the opensource blakescape server and interest increases in hosting/playing servers
soon after that (mid-2006): mitb separates itself from private servers by creating mscp
late 2006: google comes out
2007: mscp is booming with thousands of people
2007+: mscp/mitb are slowly dying (still) as cheating and emulation become decentralized, while content development is made by hundreds of amateur programmers
<p>some history of significant server releases (in chronological order):<br>
winterlove (first release)<br>
blakescape (multiplayer)<br>
mythscape (some early content)<br>
cheezscape (combat, npcs, etc)<br>
whitescape (improved content)<br>
p16 (even more improved content)<br>
rs2dv (entire new release)<br>
hyperion (first commercial scale performance release)</p>
