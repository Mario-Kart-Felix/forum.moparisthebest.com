    <title>Help With Auto cache downloader?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-auto-cache-downloader/392785</link>
    <description>Can someone help me with an Auto Cache downloader?

I&#39;m using Hybrid PvP client and it seems to have some of the things needed for an auto downloader but it doesn&#39;t work so I don&#39;t know what bits I haven&#39;t got.
I also need help Jaring it to make a webclient because when I jar it after I run it, it downloads nulled cache files. I&#39;m not sure if that has to do with the auto downloader or the jaring. Please help.

ALSO This isn&#39;t as important but does anyone know how I can do a top 5 Pkers list (based on kills) and a menu to show your kills and deaths?</description>
