    <description>Whenever i log in to my server on a new account for the first time, the HP starts at 0 and gradually rises until it gets to 99, even though the account has 10 hp. It shows up perfect in the stats menu but on the top right where your hp is located it just keeps going up.. How can i fix this and make it so it&#39;s just at 10 at the start? thanks</description>
