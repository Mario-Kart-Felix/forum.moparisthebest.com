    <title>[PI] Help Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-help-please/389412</link>
    <description>Ok I want to do two things in my Pi server.

1. Make a chest in the wildy or whereever that when u click on it, you get items
and
2. Make a store that uses tokuls or donor tix or something as a currency not gp

If you can tell me how to do these that&#39;d be great. TY!</description>

This is common knowledge. Get a guide on how to make a PI PK points reward system and remake it with what you want. And the chest is so easy a baby could do it…<br>

Im a newbie to this and I already have a pk point system. Found a guide on that and did it. But I want a donor store that uses tokuls and stuff. umm and if you would have told me how to do the chest thing, I probaly wouldn’t have [–] repped you. If you can tell me how to do it then Ill [++] rep you.[/quote]</p>
<p>You cant rep – or rep ++ dummy don’t act like a smart ass</p>
<p>[quote=“durial12, post:4, topic:389412”]Don’t you need 25 rep to rep++? Just saying. And thats no reason to rep-- him. All help on his is completely voluntary. The fact that someone has taken their own time in reading your post should be worth something to you.[/quote]you need 15 to rep</p>
