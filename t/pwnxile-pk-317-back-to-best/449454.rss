Welcome to PwnXile, the RuneScape private server brought to you by Robbie and Ed. We have hundreds online, playable 24.7 and hundreds of thousands of accounts.

Here at PwnXile we take a different approach than other generic servers you come across. We work endlessly to bring you a dedicated, high performance environment so you can play our enjoyable and content-filled server emulator.

We invest hundreds of dollars into our secure and stable server architecture to ensure dedicated uptime and a fast connection, all protected behind state of the art firewall mechanisms. Security and stability are very important to us, that&#39;s why we make sure we are the best around at offering this.

In regard to content, we have a great many minigames to play, such as Castle Wars, Fight Pits and Pest Control, as well as a few others. Each minigame is always actively being played with numerous rewards and incentives available to enhance your gaming experience.

We also have some of the most enjoyable Pking around, our Wilderness zones are always packed with pkers. Why not join them?[/b]

That’s what happens in pking servers.  You don’t fight someone on their exact terms (i.e you run, you ‘safe’, or anything) then they say “fuck off stupid failed pk3r u suk at life so suck my dick” because they’re oh so hardass</p>

<p>Not even remotely close. The PwnScape community was accepting, the PwnXile community is a joke and full of trolls and incompetent tools. As Ix Soulcist xI said, your community is completely disrespectful and you will never have a new player base because your community puts the run on them.</p>
<p>Lame community.</p>
