    <title>Bored with RS, gunna dice it all!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bored-with-rs-gunna-dice-it-all/413557</link>
    <description>I honestly can&#39;t play RS more than a few minutes without getting bored, I can&#39;t get the motivation to level anything myself, and I can&#39;t be assed to bot. So I&#39;m going to start dicing! I have probably around 100m (spent a lot on skills). If I lose it all, I wont care, but if I gain some, well, then maybe I&#39;ll get back into the game.  I probably want to dice duel, but I personally think dragon dyce is completely outrageous with a 10% commission (for just holding money...) Does anyone know of other cheaper trusted clans? No, I will not be using the clan owned by Krackkid that has drub as a trusted hoster (for those of you that got the title message ;)). Lmao.

I&#39;m starting off limiting myself with 30m right now, probably gunna do 10m bets.</description>

<p>I didn’t include commission because I didn’t think about it. My original logic still stands. Does anyone else dispute or not understand the logic? It seemed to me like most people that replied understood it, with you being the exception, David. =/ I don’t know how many other ways I can phrase it. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

What? Tying is basically a safety net, its not the same. You have more of a chance to lose or have to go again that the odds of landing in the tie-lose bubble are going to be more common. Look at it this way, your chances of winning are small. Hes saying because of this, over time you will lose more than you win if you dice systematically. If you dice 10m 12 times you will have lost more than won out of those 12, and that puts you in debt. There is no trick to dycing, its like the mob, you have to be in it to win it, the rest are suckers.<br>
[/quote]No, you wont have lost more than you would have won? You don’t LOSE anything when you tie… I completely agree that your chances of winning are of course lower than not winning, but I guess I’m missing something as to how it would be lower than your chances of LOSING something[/quote]</p>
<p>You are assuming this is a perfect system, where 100% of the money is always leftover. Let me remind you that in this system, 10% commission is always taken out. Furthermore, it’s not a matter of dicing always occurring between two people. Yeah, if two people diced one thousand times, statistically they should have each won/lost equal amount of times (which, let me remind you, does not necessarily mean they both end up with the same amount of money!) In this system, you have a 45.833% chance of winning, and so does your opponent. The remainder is a tie, which leads to another 45.833% scenario. Recursively, it’s never going to be 50%, even though there must be one winner and one loser. More importantly, after that match, you are likely going to go after another person rather than stick with the same one.</p>
<p>Going back to the imperfect system idea, in the instance of one thousand bets between the same two people. Both are going to have significantly less money <span class="bbcode-i">together</span> than they had together to begin with, because 10% depreciation over one thousand instances is a significant decrement. So if you combine the fact that you have less than a 50% chance to actually win one of these bets, with the idea that it is a lossy system (meaning money is always going out for every transaction), you will always end up losing more than you win if you were to bet infinitely. It comes down to luck and knowing how much to bet, how to play the game, and when to pull out, just like any normal casino game.</p>
<p>But I will mention the odds of dicing are far better than anything you will encounter in real world gambling. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Very simple way of looking at it ILA.</p>
<p>There are three doors, and it costs you one million dollars to open one. Inside one there is nothing, inside another there is a ‘free door open’ coupon, and inside the third there two million dollars. Right now you have a 33% chance of winning, a 33% chance of losing, and a 33% chance of getting the coupon. Right now, winning and losing have the same percent chance. Lets say that you get the coupon, the confusing factor. Now there are 3 more doors with the same things inside, but the odds are still the same as your first chance! Your chances of WINNING and LOSING are always equal (in a non-rigged environment of course :P) here, it doesn’t matter if you tie or how many times it takes you to get there… If you really cared, just think of it as if the ties don’t exist, because if you get one, you just start over from the beginning again with the same chances as your first roll. Unless we’re missing something vital here Taharok, I don’t see how your logic makes sense :S<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You don’t pay to look behind doors, it is free.[/quote]You’re missing the point (unless you’re joking), I added the paying because it added the ‘betting’ part of the game (giving someone money). You don’t normally pay to roll dice either :rolleyes:</p>

<p>[quote]That’s called the Martingale Betting System, and it doesn’t make your odds in anymore favor than before.</p>
<p>As for the actual odds of betting, they are super simple to understand. People initially think it’s a 50/50 chance, but they don’t take into consideration tying. Without going through all the math, there is a 1/12 chance of tying, meaning there is a 5.5/12 chance of losing, and 5.5/12 chance of winning. This means you have a 45.8333% chance to win, and a 58.3333% chance of not winning (meaning you have that chance to lose OR tie). Applying recursive logic, you will always have a less chance of winning than not winning, meaning you will always not win more in the long run than you will win.[/quote]</p>

Lol, but that’s common sense if you know simple math…[/quote]Is it? I think the opposite, that it’s wrong <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> While you may have a greater chance to ‘not win’ than to win, your chances of LOSING will always be the same as winning, so I don’t see Taharoks point.</p>

<p>As for the actual odds of betting, they are super simple to understand. People initially think it’s a 50/50 chance, but they don’t take into consideration tying. Without going through all the math, there is a 1/12 chance of tying, meaning there is a 5.5/12 chance of losing, and 5.5/12 chance of winning. This means you have a 45.8333% chance to win, and a 58.3333% chance of not winning (meaning you have that chance to lose OR tie). Applying recursive logic, you will always have a less chance of winning than not winning, meaning you will always not win more in the long run than you will win.[/quote]</p>

<p>There are three doors, and it costs you one million dollars to open one.

Right now you have a 33% chance of winning, a 33% chance of losing, and a 33% chance of getting the coupon. Right now, winning and losing have the same percent chance. Lets say that you get the coupon, the confusing factor. Now there are 3 more doors with the same things inside, but the odds are still the same as your first chance! Your chances of WINNING and LOSING are always equal (in a non-rigged environment of course :P) here, it doesn’t matter if you tie or how many times it takes you to get there… If you really cared, just think of it as if the ties don’t exist, because if you get one, you just start over from the beginning again with the same chances as your first roll.

<p>Ok, idk how much cash u have, lets say u have 100m.</p>
<p>First you bet 10m. Let’s say you lose. You have 90m.<br>
Now bet 20m, and lose again. You have 70m.<br>
Now bet 40m. You win, you have 110m.<br>
Start back at 10m.<br>
I recommend lower numbers in that instance. You should be prepaired at the most to lose 4-5 in a row. 150m is a good number to bet 4 times in a row with @ 10m.<br>

I think you’re forgetting that in a tie, your money doesn’t go anywhere, you just go again. It’s simple logic that everyone has the same odds here, so you can’t have two people with a 45.8% chance of winning, it doesn’t add up! While sure, you have a 58% chance of ‘not winning’, your chance of LOSING is still 50% (because a tie doesn’t influence the pot/statistics/anything at all) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

So I’m going to start dicing! I have probably around 100m (spent a lot on skills). If I lose it all, I wont care, but if I gain some, well, then maybe I’ll get back into the game.  I probably want to dice duel, but I personally think dragon dyce is completely outrageous with a 10% commission (for just holding money…) Does anyone know of other cheaper trusted clans? No, I will not be using the clan owned by Krackkid that has drub as a trusted hoster (for those of you that got the title message ;)). Lmao.</p>
<p>I’m starting off limiting myself with 30m right now, probably gunna do 10m bets.[/quote]<br>
nice! dicing forced me to quit when i lost my bank… ;)have fun!</p>

<p>I feel like I should clean out my house of the stuff in there though (infinity etc), probably got like 10-20m in there.</p>
