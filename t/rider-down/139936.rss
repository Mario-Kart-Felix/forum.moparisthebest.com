    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rider-down/139936</link>
    <description>Well.. Here I am again, with another &quot;boring&quot; motorbike related topic.
But, this one is a sincere one.

Anyway, on the weekend I was racing, this time it was not Motocross, but it was Longtrack. (The one where you go around a HUGE circle at like 100mph and just keep it pegged), Anyway, I was coming down the straightway at like 100mph behind one of my Motocross friend&#39;s, and he was in front of me.. And I was in behind him eating roost like a bitch. All of a sudden his bike highsides and kicks him into the air. I was nearly taken out by his bike and narrowly missed him when he landed. I knew the crash was bad, and him and I were ahead of the pack by a bit.. I immediantly slammed my breaks and laid my bike over at a very fast speed, yes, it took a lot of the skin off my left side. I quickly got up and ran over to his wreck and ran infront of him trying to signal riders to go around. Yes the yellow flag was out, but a lot of the time riders do not see it in flat track.

Anyway, he was airlifted with a neck brace and a broken wrist. His wrist was a clean break. Right through the middle, snapped in half if you will. I believe he had injuries to his back, which I hate to think if it is spinal related.

Get well soon #800.</description>

<p>Man that sucks, :(, but at least it was a clean break. I broke my arm when I was around 6, wasn’t pretty, had a huge contraption with needles going into my arm for 6 weeks.</p>

<p>If you are talking to me, i stopped because my bike was ceased by the police because i kept riding it around my house and on this private field, they kept warning me but we just kept hiding then they caught us and took mine and my friends.</p>
<p>Where i used to race was like a 2 hour drive from where i lived, then i had a eye injury and just fell out of that kind of stuff, found a computer lost my life.<br>

              <p>Well… Here I am again, with another “boring” motorbike related topic.<br>
But, this one is a sincere one.</p>
<p>Anyway, on the weekend I was racing, this time it was not Motocross, but it was Longtrack. (The one where you go around a HUGE circle at like 100mph and just keep it pegged), Anyway, I was coming down the straightway at like 100mph behind one of my Motocross friend’s, and he was in front of me… And I was in behind him eating roost like a bitch. All of a sudden his bike highsides and kicks him into the air. I was nearly taken out by his bike and narrowly missed him when he landed. I knew the crash was bad, and him and I were ahead of the pack by a bit… I immediantly slammed my breaks and laid my bike over at a very fast speed, yes, it took a lot of the skin off my left side. I quickly got up and ran over to his wreck and ran infront of him trying to signal riders to go around. Yes the yellow flag was out, but a lot of the time riders do not see it in flat track.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was airlifted with a neck brace and a broken wrist. His wrist was a clean break. Right through the middle, snapped in half if you will. I believe he had injuries to his back, which I hate to think if it is spinal related.</p>
<p>Get well soon <span class="hashtag">#800</span>.</p>
