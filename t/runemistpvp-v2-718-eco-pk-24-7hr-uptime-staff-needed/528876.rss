- Great PVM&#39;ing including: CORP, QBD, NEX, GODWARS (All bosses!), Tormented Demons
(drop claws!), Gano Beasts, Revenants for Vesta, Glacors, Barrows, Mith drags and MUCH more!
- A great server for those who love to skill! Cheap skilling outfits available!
- Build that cash stack high! Crafting and Theiving is great to make money with!
- Great training spots for you and your friends to work together: Rock crabs, Yaks, Apes + more!
- Switch between item looks (old versions and new versions!)
- Working Lost-City quest!
- Fight caves + Fight Kiln!
- Full summoning! BoB fully working!
- Duel Arena
- Dwarf Cannon Quest!
- Shops with all your vital starter PVM gear (Full dragon etc!)
- Work to get your Godwars armour and high value loot -- It&#39;s not just given away in shops!
