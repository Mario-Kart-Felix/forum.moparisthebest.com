    <title>Interview - Career Research Project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/interview-career-research-project/542196</link>
    <description>I&#39;m doing research paper over Computer Science related careers, and one of the requirements is to have an interview. This interview can be done different ways, such as through Skype. With this being said, I was wondering if anyone is currently/has been involved in a computer science related career, and if you would be willing to allow me to interview you. If you are able to be interviewed, please feel free to reply, as it would be extremely helpful and appreciated.</description>
