    <title>I need an answer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-an-answer/393158</link>
    <description>Well I have a really important question for my server:

Should I include Godswords, and Bandos armor, etc. in my server (I am making an economic server).


Pros: 
Will be one of the more richer person weapons as they will be really hard to get (must get hilts and shards)
Will make people fight bosses and make the game more rewarding.

Cons: 
Most of the time over-powered.
Will be very rare, and poor people will have a hard time acquiring.


Let me know with a simple vote, thanks.</description>

[/quote]Totaly agree, but for those of us who prefer 317 not to leach off of (like me), we might want those. I don’t know about him but the highest I’ll ever go is 474 for now. Don’t really like 508+ :L[/quote]<br>
There are a few 474s out there that are not to dissimilar from 317 bases, they have all the items you want with a lot less hassle.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/zoft">@zoft</a>, if its a 474 lookalike with 474 items, it might as well just be done as a 474 :/. People put so much work into something just to keep the same base, ends up increasing client size, increasing bug possibilities, and increasing the time it takes to do just about any additions to the server.</p>

Costumes ruin gameplay personally. I’d rather play a private server where there is no customs/overpowered weapons. Eg: godswords, etc. However, if it’s a higher revision around the 400’s (or so), yes do it. No customs like dragon claws and such.</p>
