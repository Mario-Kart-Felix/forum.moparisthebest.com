    <title>Oddest error ever!</title>

    <description>So im hosting 2 servers, one on port 5555 and one on 43593. they both use the same no-ip address. I&#39;ve done this before and there was no problems.
But for some reason now the server on 5555 won&#39;t let anyone connect on the client that was built for it. It only lets the hoster, me connect even though theres nothing in the files about letting local host connect from 127.0.0.1
but if i get on the client built for the server on port 43594, change the port to 5555 and log in. some how it logs me into the server on 5555. and others. but nothing will load right because the models arent built for that server.

HOW DO I FIX</description>
