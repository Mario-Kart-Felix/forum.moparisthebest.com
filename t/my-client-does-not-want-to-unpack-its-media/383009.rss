    <title>My client does not want to unpack its media?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-client-does-not-want-to-unpack-its-media/383009</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded a cache editor.
I changed the mod crowns to my own custom mod crowns.
I compiled and got no errors.
But now my client won&#39;t unpack the media.
I keep trying to open the cache but it never does so I can&#39;t remove the crowns.
What can I do?</description>

              <p>Well, if you clicked + and added a couple of crowns that way without adding the code to correspond with it clientside then you shouldn’t be able to open your cache and will either have to add the code to your client class which enables crowns up to player rights 4 for if you added 2 crowns, rights 3 if you added 1 etc… but otherwise you’re going to have to use a backup cache you have and if you don’t have that and are unable to do the crown code you’ll have to restart but I’ll see if I can find the tutorial for adding crowns through the cache for you.</p>

              <p>I Vain I, it does sound like a damaged cache but I wouldn’t rule anything else out quite yet. kicker, I would try changing your batch file to:</p>
<p><code>@echo off
COLOR 08
title Runescape's Ecstacy client V3
@echo Client Is loading......
@echo -----------------------
java -Xmx1024m -cp .;Theme.jar Gui 0 0 highmem members 32
pause</code></p>
<p>Also, check to make sure the crowns you added aren’t too big. One last thing that I know could’ve gone wrong would’ve been if you added the crowns wrong as in if you hit the + symbol and actually ADDED crowns to the cache instead of overwriting the ones that were already in it.</p>
