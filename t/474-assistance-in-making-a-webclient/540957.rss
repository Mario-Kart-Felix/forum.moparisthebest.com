    <title>[474]Assistance in making a webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/474-assistance-in-making-a-webclient/540957</link>
    <description>Hello.

I have a client (not of the usual sort, it seems) which I would like to turn into a webclient...

The client already has a cache downloader and it is fantastic in and of itself... However.

I cannot seem to get it to run through a browser... I would highly appreciate some help regarding this.

Thank you very much.

P.S. I created the HTML file through jarmaker, I&#39;ve also tried a custom html file provided by various guides... I feel the issue is in the client itself.</description>
