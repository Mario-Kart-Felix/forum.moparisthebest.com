    <description>Hi everybody.

I am a new moperscaper and I have limited knowledege to what I am suppose to do here.. 

I&#39;ve downloaded a new moparscape private servers they seem very familiar to runescape 2 for some reason thats why im confused.

Secondly I ran a moparscape server and for some reason I get around 200 players but when I do shout outs no one talks back and im pretty positive people know how to do shout outs as well but no one talks, I don&#39;t know if im doing the servers correctly so can someone help me out on this as well.

Another thing for some reason the server stops working after a hour is that normal??

Finally can someone suggest me the best server to get started with.

Thanks yall i&#39;ll be sticking around here for some time.

              <p>Ah I see so that SYIpkpkr is related somehow do the 200 players I see so its a bug in the server software.</p>
<p>Oh I couldn’t get Rs2d to run so thats not for me.</p>
<p>Well thank you for the response!</p>

              <p>the 200 players are all ‘Null’ players, basically a connection to your server that is ‘fake’…</p>
<p>And yes, many servers tend to stop working after running for so long.</p>
<p>The best server to start out with is Rs2d, But that is a little complicated for beginners.</p>
