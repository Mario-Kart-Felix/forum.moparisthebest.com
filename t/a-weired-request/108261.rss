    <description>Hi, ive only got about 100 character files on my new server because ive only had it up a few hours. Anyway

there was an admin who was spawning on my server and i banned him because he broke rules by spawning like 999m phats and dropped them. So...

is there a file or .bat file that i can use to search through the account and find out which ones have rares? like it searches the party hat and santa codes and such?

thanks</description>

<p>neit youll have to go through character files 1 by 1 to get all the rares… or just delete all char files and start over <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> or you can just wait it out and find out who has them by seeing them with them</p>
