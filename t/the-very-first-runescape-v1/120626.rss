echo.
echo Welcome, to the very first ever RuneScape! By Le Ltd 
echo (little to do(so we made this)). This is a text based game, which was 
echo the very first version of RuneScape! After much developement, Le sold the 
echo idea to Jagex Ltd because it was getting nowhere, but after Le saw what 
echo Jagex Ltd had done with the game, he was shocked. Jagex had developed an 
echo entire new game with the idea, RuneScape Classic! Le was shocked
echo by the huge success, and was mad for selling the idea; but once the 
echo RuneScape we all Know and love came out, RuneScape 2, Le was furious with  
echo himself for selling the first version of RuneScape developed by Le Ltd. 
echo Le had put so much work into it, only to find it could have been a huge 
echo success with a little developement, and he could have been making millions  
echo of dollars with all the the $5 paying addicts. Le was so furious, that
echo he set off to overcome Jagex Ltd and make a new RuneScape, a better 
echo RuneScape, but since they googled all the answers on moparscape
echo quiz, this is all Le and Le Ltd could come up with.

echo.
echo Welcome, as a male of RuneScape, your main goal is to snag the rare
echo partyhat, and if your really lucky, the female. Females are scarce, 
echo 10 percent of RuneScape is a female, and 90 percent of that 10 percent 
echo is a male pretending to be a female, so watch out. Also, females can 
echo be very dangerous, known to have hit 90&#39;s with the lengendary bitch 
echo slap. They can also suck you dry quicker than a noob in Lumbridge 
echo when you&#39;re wearing full dragon. Your secondary goals are to avoid said 
echo noobs, as they will stick to you like a bad germ, and to become the 
echo strongest in the game, making wise choices and actually playing the game. 
echo Good luck.

title Welcome
echo.
echo Welcome, as a female of RuneScape, your main goal is to dig as much
echo gold as you can from the pockets of males. Males will be warned of females, 
echo and their sometimes lack of the female parts. So be careful, they may be
echo suspicious of you. Your secondary goals are to look as &quot;prettifull&quot; and
echo &quot;seksi&quot; as you possibly can, and buy items for their looks instead
echo of their bonuses. Good luck.

[i]This is my side project, because coding my server gets tedius, so making this is like a break. Keep coming back and following the instructions to get the latest version, and by the way, the game is most funny if you try all the routes. Enjoy.[/i]</description>

<p>And added an error screen</p>
<p>This stops you from being able to press enter and go thought the game quick.</p>

echo Welcome, to the very first ever RuneScape! By Le Ltd 
echo (little to do(so we made this)). This is a text based game, which was 
echo the very first version of RuneScape! After much developement, Le sold the 
echo idea to Jagex Ltd because it was getting nowhere, but after Le saw what 
echo Jagex Ltd had done with the game, he was shocked. Jagex had developed an 
echo entire new game with the idea, RuneScape Classic! Le was shocked
echo by the huge success, and was mad for selling the idea; but once the 
echo RuneScape we all Know and love came out, RuneScape 2, Le was furious with  
echo himself for selling the first version of RuneScape developed by Le Ltd. 
echo Le had put so much work into it, only to find it could have been a huge 
echo success with a little developement, and he could have been making millions  
echo of dollars with all the the $5 paying addicts. Le was so furious, that
echo he set off to overcome Jagex Ltd and make a new RuneScape, a better 
echo RuneScape, but since they googled all the answers on moparscape
echo quiz, this is all Le and Le Ltd could come up with.

echo 10 percent of RuneScape is a female, and 90 percent of that 10 percent 
echo is a male pretending to be a female, so watch out. Also, females can 
echo be very dangerous, known to have hit 90's with the lengendary bitch 
echo slap. They can also suck you dry quicker than a noob in Lumbridge 
echo when you're wearing full dragon. Your secondary goals are to avoid said 
echo noobs, as they will stick to you like a bad germ, and to become the 
echo strongest in the game, making wise choices and actually playing the game. 
echo Good luck.

echo suspicious of you. Your secondary goals are to look as "prettifull" and
echo "seksi" as you possibly can, and buy items for their looks instead
echo of their bonuses. Good luck.

<p>Yes I agree with you there, the game does sound a bit sexist, but its the cold truth of RuneScape. 90% of girl players in rs are actually guys…ugh…one good reason to switch to private servers…less…“gender confusion”? lol. Nice I might add on a bit myself… ;D</p>
