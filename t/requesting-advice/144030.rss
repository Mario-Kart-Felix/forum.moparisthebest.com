    <title>Requesting Advice</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-advice/144030</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m requesting advice into which source I should use. Just tried Testscape, not as good as I would have hoped. I need a source in which the client already has a place where you can add objects. Otherwise, it&#39;s too much trouble to keep adding and replacing the code. If anyone could help that would be great.  ;)
