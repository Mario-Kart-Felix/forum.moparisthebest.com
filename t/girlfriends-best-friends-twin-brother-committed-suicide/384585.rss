    <title>Girlfriend&#39;s best friend&#39;s twin brother committed suicide</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/girlfriends-best-friends-twin-brother-committed-suicide/384585</link>
    <description>Well my girlfriend is like really close friends with this girl, and this girl&#39;s twin brother hung himself like 10 days ago. I haven&#39;t been active lately due to helping out with this whole thing, because everyone loved this kid and he never seemed like the kind of kid who would... anyways, the kids name is Kyle Ernst, if anyone has heard of this kid. This has had like a huge impact on our community and stuff like our schools are doing presentations on it, and his funeral was today. I went with my girlfriend and this girl who was his sister had to be carried in because she was crying so hard. Everyone was like bawling, and I was too. It was the saddest funeral I&#39;ve ever been to. Stuff was awful. 

Anyways, if anyone knows anyone contemplating suicide, please convince them it&#39;s not worth it. They are a loved person.</description>

<p>I agree man, things like this shouldn’t be happening in the world. It makes me sad when i hear of a person who has attempted or has succeeded in killing themselves. We only live once ya know?</p>

              <p>I’m terribly sorry for the loss man. I have a cousin ( around his early 30’s ) and his fiance hung herself as well and she had a kid with my cousin and everything. No one expected it to happen either, but we looked through her phone and a bunch of drunk women continually sent text to her, telling her that she was a bad mother. The next morning my cousin walks down stairs only to find her hung from the ceiling. It was a very sad moment <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> as I’m sure yours was too.</p>

<p>Again, you don’t know any of use as far as personal knowing. You can’t sit their and state that we don’t have the right to be in some kind of depression, and depression isn’t through peer pressure, correct me if I’m wrong. I’ve never seen or heard of such a person to be through peer pressure, and call it depression.</p>
<p>Some kid that I knew at our school, that we held some big thing for killed herself because she was raped, and raped by her father, and her mother didn’t know a thing about it. And indeed she was a bit bullied at school, and her father told her if she ever told her mother; he would kill her. Now he is arrested and having to grieve about the whole thing, and her mother hates him. So please enough with all that non sense.</p>

              <p>I’m 14 and to be honest when ever i feel a bit down I pretty much attempt to make a joke about it. When i got bullied at school i use to just sit and ignore it. One day they said one thing to much and boom. I went physico And then i never got bullied again and i reckon that is one of the main reasons us teenagers get depressed.<br>
OP; I feel for you man. Just try to stay away from the path your girlfriends friend twin brother chose. :\</p>

<p>I believe that is the most mature comment from a normal user ever posted on this site. Well done.<br>
Also, very sorry for your loss. I find that when I get crazy thoughts like this, I go to the gym and box with friends. They have gloves n stuff, and just being able to take out all your anger through punching at people stronger then you really relieves stress.</p>

<p>I think most teenagers at some time or another think about suicide. I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t more than once (usually after a fight with my parents), the thing is, if you ever do have thoughts like that, take a nap. Usually a good sleep makes me feel better. If you still have the same thoughts, you may need some counseling; maybe you are depressed?</p>
<p>Just remember, life exists outside of being a teenager, why not let it get better?</p>

<p>Your loss must of been a huge impact and I hope it doesn’t attempt others to commit suicide because if they fail (it will hurt anyway), but it they fail, it will make a <span class="bbcode-b">huge</span> impact of them and become in bad depression.</p>
<p>Please don’t hesitate to come talk to me, I know I’m in deep depression, but I still love to help others with the kind of same problems I have, and others who’ve seen such loss.</p>
<p>Nephew’s Uncle committed suicide about three months ago because of our disease in our family blood, and he couldn’t take it anymore. So I will have the same idea of the pain and will know how it is like.</p>

<p>no pain at all? what ways?[/quote]<br>
Tylenol PM, around 40 pills. Tylenol ES, around 30. OD is around 8 pills for both. I know people that died from both and they felt nothing (according to the doctors) but that is controversial.</p>

I was on prozac for 2 1/2 years. Please, by all means, don’t bs me with that. If you wanted to commit suicide and fully go through with it, you would of done so. A 10 year old could go to a local pharmacy and buy a lot of over the counter drugs and successfully go through with it. I don’t know you but I’ve no doubt that your life is pretty hard but instead of complaining about it, why not make something of it? You can of course give me reasons why that isn’t possible or how you don’t want to but in the end; what is the real reason? Laziness? Physical/Emotional Abuse? Pressure? Maybe all of them. <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Get over it</span></span>. I may sound like a ass but what is being a emo <span class="bbcode-i">(or whatever term that you want to use, I don’t care as that is what society labels people that suffer depression)</span> going to accomplish in the long run? Nothing. I learned that the hard way when I turned 18.</p>

<p>Sorry for your loss <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  its always hard to deal with death, but when its suicide, its terrible. The psychological aspect must have been even worse though, considering he said goodbye and seemed to have no given reason <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>Depressing, really. [quote author=Ix Soulcist xI link=topic=480349.msg3516895#msg3516895 date=1299067174]<br>
Dearest apologies about this loss, I’m not going to lie. I’ve attempted suicide about four times, and because of that. I’ve been in deep deep depression for the past nine months and mother doesn’t even seem to care or notice, not even others.</p>
<p>Your loss must of been a huge impact and I hope it doesn’t attempt others to commit suicide because if they fail (it will hurt anyway), but it they fail, it will make a <span class="bbcode-b">huge</span> impact of them and become in bad depression.</p>
<p>Please don’t hesitate to come talk to me, I know I’m in deep depression, but I still love to help others with the kind of same problems I have, and others who’ve seen such loss.</p>
<p>Nephew’s Uncle committed suicide about three months ago because of our disease in our family blood, and he couldn’t take it anymore. So I will have the same idea of the pain and will know how it is like.</p>
<p>Much Prayers.<br>

I’m not trying to be a dick but I wouldn’t care if I was your mom either. If you really wanted to kill yourself, you would have done so. There are many effective ways of doing so that involves no pain at all…[/quote]</p>
<p>no pain at all? what ways?</p>
