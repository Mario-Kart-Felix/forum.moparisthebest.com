i think it is a big hoax lol well cmon its like slavery its even worse than minimum wage but hang on wait 4 x 30 = 120 holy shite im going to china to get a job <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> 120$ a month for playing games wooohoo<br>

<p>Your a complete retard. Exploitation happens everyday. The clothes your wearing now are probably made by little kids getting $0.30 a day in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>These gold farmers exploit Chinese and Korean men who are trying to make money to keep their children alive. They are getting such a little amount a day, that they are hardly able to feed their kids, let alone give them a home.</p>
<p>You’d probably get $10 a month for clicking for 17 hours a day.</p>
<p>So, I repeat, Criptic. You’re a complete, and utter, idiot.[/quote]How is it that some of the Chinese people can afford members…? Or are they just bots.</p>
