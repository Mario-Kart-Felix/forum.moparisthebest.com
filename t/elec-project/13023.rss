    <description>I go to a technical high school, and im in Elextronics, and we have a shop &#39;fair&#39; coming up. Everybody Grades 10+ is required to do something, and I was wondering if anybody had any ideas... Ideas can include circuits, audio, programming, scripting, lights anythiing that has to do with electronics just about... I was thinking a small tetris type game with java or C++, but I don&#39;t really have much exp. with java, and I have none with C++... So I need some help, suggestions are very welcome...

Also I&#39;m not too bad at HTML, so if you have an idea of a small website I could build, that wouldnt take too long, post here... :rolleyes:</description>
