&lt;h1 style=&quot;font-family:Times; text-align:Left;&quot;&gt;RSPS Coding&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 style=&quot;text-align:Left;&quot;&gt;Trying to understand the basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside style=&quot;text-align:Left;&quot;&gt;I would like to post a topic to try and find out some information about RSPS resources and coding&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Clients &amp; Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I used to have my own Dodian with a peak of &lt;em&gt;10 players&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
Servers and clients were easy to find, the links were new and they weren&#39;t all outdated, so I have a couple of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Where can people find updated Links for Clients and Sources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say you have a benchmark for a server, you know what revision you want, you want it to be functional&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Where would you go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;You have errors?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When coding, if you&#39;re like me, sometimes you&#39;re not always paying the most attention or paying to much attention and can&#39;t figure a problem out.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;What resources are there to help people out&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learning to code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When learning to code, there&#39;s no real good foundation to start on, I know that and have been told that.&lt;br&gt;
But I was wondering if there were any threads that you recommend that people look into if they are interested&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;/article&gt;

              <p>You’ll find some private servers, for a variety of games, on Github. You might also find some on Bitbucket.</p>
<p>There’s a plethora of language-learning material out there that is up-to-date and easy to find. It’s just that this content is not within the context of Runescape private server development, which is actually extremely niche now (not a lot of it is happening, at least publicly, as it used to years ago).</p>

              <p>I can’t answer all your questions. But I can answer your questions about how to learn to code and solve problems.</p>
<p>To learn how to code, you can always start with the official Java tutorials, which you can find <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, assuming it’s Java you want to learn.</p>
<p>Your problem solving skills naturally follow with your coding skills. So there’s not much more to it than that.</p>
