    <title>Load and save client side</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/load-and-save-client-side/375931</link>
    <description>Is there a way to save and load character information client side so it will take that burden off server side? In some servers every 15 seconds a method is processed that saves your characters information, this causes lag. I know about the whole modifying your character file(can always encrypt it) and giving you an unfair advantage and I really don&#39;t care about that i just need to know if its possible. I know about the other much faster means but i am just interested in this way and if it is possible.</description>
