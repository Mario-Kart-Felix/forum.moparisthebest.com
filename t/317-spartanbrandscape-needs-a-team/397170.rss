    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-spartanbrandscape-needs-a-team/397170</link>
    <description>Hello I am the owner of spartanbrandscape! I am in need of a team that can help me code and maybe do some advertising. I know a lot about coding but I need someone to add npc&#39;s and just regular weapon models! I am super busy coding other things and I need someone that knows what they are doing to help me. My server has 8 people on average but I made it earlier this week. So with the right help we could make this server rock@!</description>
