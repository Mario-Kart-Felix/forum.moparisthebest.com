    <title>Need a coder to make me a training arena in central varrock!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-coder-to-make-me-a-training-arena-in-central-varrock/109765</link>
    <description>Please,
I have been wondering if theres a good enough coder!
I have been thinking for some time...what if there was a huge training base to train mage,prayer,att,def,str,rcing,wcing, and fletching, and fishing in one training arena.

I realise, this is asking alot, but it would mean alot.

I would be really grateful if someone wrote up a code, easy to know where to put, so i could have a training room (i dont want to use a command to get there), my server players could use!.</description>
