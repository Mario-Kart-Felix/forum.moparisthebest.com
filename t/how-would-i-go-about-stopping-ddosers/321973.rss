    <title>How would I go about stopping Ddosers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-go-about-stopping-ddosers/321973</link>
    <description>Lately an old friend of mine has been Ddosing me. 

Simply... How would I go about stopping it?

He get&#39;s my Ip whenever I talk to him or He get&#39;s it threw my No-Ip.</description>

<p>Sounds retarded, but 2 of my friends reported him to the F.B.I. but that was weeks ago and nothing has happened, and he continues to ddos people.</p>

<p>It’s not a server, it is my actual internet. The kid who is ddosing me doesn’t play Private Servers, he just plays RuneScape. He is a RuneScape addict who ddoses people when he gets mad at them. And that’s what he does, he has a program, that allows him to get anyone’s IP that he deals with, so like MSN and Skype, he even has Jagex’s IP cause he plays RuneScape(He has their servers Ip, individual worlds)</p>
<p>If I block his IP then I will have to block 50 others, on a daily basis. He will just keep on changing his IP and ddosing me when he has a chance.</p>
<p>Is there any type of a program that blocks it out so only a certain amount of connections can connect to my router in a certain amount of time.</p>
<p>My router is strong enough, so if he ddoses me like on RuneScape, I have 3 seconds to do something to avoid it.</p>
