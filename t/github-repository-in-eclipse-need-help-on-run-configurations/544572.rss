    <title>GitHub repository in Eclipse -- need help on run configurations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/github-repository-in-eclipse-need-help-on-run-configurations/544572</link>
    <description>So I got this repository from GitHub, cloned it to my laptop and imported it to Eclipse as a Local Repository but now I can&#39;t run it (or build it).
When I attempt to run it it gives me the following error: &quot;The selection cannot be launched, and there are no recent launches&quot;.

I&#39;ve looked up what that meant and apparently it means that since you didn&#39;t create this project there is no build path or run configurations associated with the project. (Note that there&#39;s also no .PROJECT file in the project itself).

The repository shows in the Git Repositories panel and right clicking it won&#39;t give me any option to set its Run Configurations or anything.
Selecting Run Configurations from the top menu allows me to make a custom configurations but when I hit Search it won&#39;t find my project (so I can&#39;t select the main file either).

Some help/advice woul be nice :)</description>

<p>Exactly what I did and it worked <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Made a new project, copied over the .classpath and .project files and changed everything accordingly.<br>
Re-imported the project with the files and selected the main file and it worked ^^</p>
