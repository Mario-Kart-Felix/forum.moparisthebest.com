    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-with-unbanning-getpass-on-508/315801</link>
    <description>I have just made a 508 server. To test, i muted one of my best players from my 317, he had trained to all 99&#39;s. Un-mute worked fine. Then i banned him, but i couldn&#39;t un-ban him, great lol. Then i made him a new account with master but i need to know how to unban. Also, my co-owner died and changed his password. Then when he tried logging on the next day, it did&#39;nt work. &quot;Check your username and password&quot;. I really need some help as this is very important. I am using a Mezzyscape/TokkulScape 508 source. Please help!</description>

              <p>To unban someone you have to go to the config folder and find bans or banned users or something and delete the name from that text file, and for the password you go to the characters folder and find his name, open the text file and you can change the password from character-password… in my server its the 3rd row</p>
