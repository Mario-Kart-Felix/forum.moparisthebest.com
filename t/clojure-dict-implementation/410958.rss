protip if your only reasoning for not liking lisps is that they’re higher level (not necessarily true if you think back to the old LISP machines) then i’ll regard you as a random ASSEMBLY AND C IS COOLER FSGSFSFHGSGH person or just someone that doesn’t understand their elegance. i’m a fanboy, who cares, no one should insult something that’s greater than them.</p>

<p>honestly, you fuckwits really can’t judge a language as ugly when you’ve never used it (or probably heard of it until now), giving it a good trial run would probably change your mind assuming you’re capable of grasping why lisp is great (i don’t know why i bothered stating that, understanding lisp is way beyond everyone in this thread anyway)</p>

I can comprehend it. I find it ugly.<br>
And, I mean comprehend as in understand (the <span class="bbcode-u">actual</span> definition), not programming with it. I think it would be a bitch to program with though.[/quote]<br>
i’m talking about one comprehending every line of the code and understanding the exact semantics of how it works, not just the general idea. also, lisps are elegant languages when you look at them in the proper way and you understand why they do things in the way that they do and understand the power and possibilities that stem from the way they do things</p>
