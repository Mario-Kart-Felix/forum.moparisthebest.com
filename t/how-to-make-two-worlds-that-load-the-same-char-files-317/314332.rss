    <description>okay well, its a pretty simple thing to do, having two servers load the same char files.
you may not need this, but it comes in handy if you want two worlds on your server,(ex: a pvp world and a skiller world)
PART I:SAVING YOUR CHAR FILES
first what you need to do is this,

open your client class and search for

[code]public void savegame(boolean logout)[/code]

scroll down until you see something like this

[code]characterfile = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;./characters/&quot;
+ playerName + &quot;.txt&quot;));[/code]

change that to [code]characterfile = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;C:\characters\&quot;
+ playerName + &quot;.txt&quot;));[/code]

this now makes it so that when you logout,it saves your char file to your C drive(hard drive).

PART II:LOADING YOUR CHAR FILES.

still in your client class,
search for
[code]public int loadgame[/code]
scroll down until you see something like this
[code]			characterfile = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;./characters/&quot;
					+ playerName + &quot;.txt&quot;));[/code]

now change that to this

[code]characterfile = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;C:\characters\&quot;
+ playerName + &quot;.txt&quot;));[/code]

save&gt;compile&gt;done.

if i messed up on something, please feel free to tell me,ask me.

i wrote all of this up my self so if you say i leeched it then just go away.

END RESULTS:
basically what you have done here is now instead of saving/loading your char files from your server files. it now saves and loads from your C:\ drive. DO THIS TO BOTH OF YOUR SERVER FILES.

now if you log out from one world and log onto the other. your char will be the exact same :D have fun!</description>
