    <title>Differentiating Java Guru and RSPS Guru</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/differentiating-java-guru-and-rsps-guru/445161</link>
    <description>With Taharok taking the place as the new admin it&#39;s cool yet sort of obvious that there has been a rise in the amount of java guru badges given out to a variety of different people who are well deserving. The rank specified by MITB originally in the badges thread was supposed to be given out to people who understand RSPS well enough and released coherent information to help out with future progress. There was a huge uproar originally when I was given the badge and not seem as fit, not that I don&#39;t see anyone as not fit, but the java guru rank is seeing more members who help out in the programming section and for other reasons that&#39;s not really my business to ask in the first place. I saw the badge as a status of people who were complaced with RSPS knowledge and although the misleading name, most of the people who had the badge before the point that Taharok got admin had a role in RSPS development. Some of that role may not have been very large, as in my case where I only released information, to Method who released the most popular cache downloader and keeps it up to date. It&#39;s a little. The line is very bold. So, can we create a new badge to differentiate the two ranks? A lot of this is bias towards myself but I see it sort of fit now under the circumstances. 

Edit:

If it passes [IMG]http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/Mewtwo.png[/img] would be hawt.</description>

              <p>I did want a badge like this to replace the ‘Java Coder’ rank, and keep the Java Guru rank as one specifically for those people whom are proficient in Java programming. It should essentially represent the same thing as C, C#, C++, Lisp, and the other programming cups. They are programmer-based ranks. Pretty simple. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I’ll beam to frell to make a demo for this award. We can discuss it more in the staff section.</p>

<p>I already suggested something of the sort to Moparisthebest and his reply (as in the reason he said he gave you the badge originally) was that the Java Guru badge was given to people with the understanding of the RS Protocol ages ago, and I didn’t argue, even though I wanted to. I felt like his examples (speljohan for instance) were already Java guru’s at the time, but meh. He didn’t exactly dismiss the idea of a new rank, but he skirted around it and I’m not sure how he would feel about it.</p>

<p>Now the badge doesn’t really stand for that. It <span class="bbcode-i">did</span>. No offense. For the exception of iKilem, I see the badge more as for people who are more experienced with java. Which is good. I’m not expressing that it isn’t. But since the purpose has changed with the newer people who are given the badge, would it be good to have a clear cut line now more than ever?</p>
<p>I could understand his concerns.</p>
