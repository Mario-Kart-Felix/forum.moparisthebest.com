    <description>Hello Moparscape

Unfortunately I have to report that he has resigned from his position of Global Moderator. Some think he was perhaps simply becoming too old for the job (Bieber, 2014), but the decision was necessary to maintain the integrity of our community and our people.

Those who got to know him during his time here at MoparScape remember an outspoken but diligent moderator (Davidi, 2014), while others (Bieber, 2014) will unfortunately remember him for the decisions he made during the latter stages of his tenure. I am not allowed to discuss the nature of these decisions, but I am sure you are free to post your own experiences in this topic.

A truly international moderator, DeathsChaos9 was born in Columbia, SC, schooled in Bejing, and returned to the US to serve his time as Global Moderator. I know that everyone in our community will join me in extending our heartfelt sympathies to them at this profoundly difficult time.

<blockquote>[b]Rule 1:[/b]
Moderators lock topics/remove posts and topics/hand infractions to users at their own discretion as required to foster a positive community.</blockquote>
<p>I enforced the rules of this community, the severity of punishment was usually based on the members history. For sake of argument lets say that a member insulted another member. If the offender had a clean history I’d issue nothing more than a warning. I was harsh when I was dealing with members with X number of previous infractions. If a member had zero regards to the rules of this site I’d have zero tolerance when issuing and infraction.</p>
<p>The <span class="bbcode-b">only</span> members to dispute their infractions (to me) were the ones that were consistently breaking rules and as soon as they could post again they’d go right back to breaking rules. I was harsh but my actions were never unwarranted.</p>
