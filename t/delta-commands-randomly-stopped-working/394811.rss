    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-commands-randomly-stopped-working/394811</link>
    <description>Well i dont even think i edited anything in commands part of client.java but somereason commands stopped working. ::pickup isnt working for admin or owner (which its set to admin+). ::master aint working for admin or owner like its set to. ::pure isnt working for players or my owner account (i set ::pure rights to 0 lastnight n i tested it and it was working)

All my commands was working perfectly lastnight and i dont think i change anything that should effect them.. and now non of them are working at all.. compiler is not picking up any errors.. anybody know whats wrong and how to fix?</description>

              <p>I think you must have changed the rights. Go back and check again. Sometimes mistakes like this occur without the person knowing… Read it carefully and you will probbaly figure out why.</p>
