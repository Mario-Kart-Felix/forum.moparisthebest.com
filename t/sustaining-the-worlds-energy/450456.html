<p>There’s no doubt that sustainable energy sources are a must, we can no longer keep ourselves living from oil, which is rapidly depleting. We must find a different way. Que renewable/sustainable energy. This is but a name given to a wide number of solutions, which none of the solutions alone will be able to hold the energy demand for the entire world, they must be used together. For example, wind power. I’ve been offshore and visited wind turbines, and believe me, they do a damn good job. However, they cannot hold the Earths demand for energy alone. Wind power, most commonly wind turbines, are easily maintained compared to some other types of renewable engineering solutions. They are also relatively cheap, you can get your own wind turbine for £2000 from the local hardware store. If you have a general knowledge of mechanical and  electrical engineering, you can create your own easily enough. The downfall of wind turbines is that the older residents of the area you’re erecting them in generally disapprove. They believe they’re an eyesore, but I don’t think they realise the potential they hold.</p>

        <p>I’ve done a few school term papers on certain types of renewable energies. There are a lot more solutions out there than most people realize. For example, my personal favorite is algal oil (that is, oil derived from cultures of specific species of algae). Algal oil is immensely fascinating. They are able to produce it in large quantities and in short time periods (don’t quote me, but I think they can gather something like 70% of the oil from the cultures every day before starting a new culture). What’s more fascinating is, the phosolipids from the algae form the same hydrocarbon structure as petroleum, which means that algal oil can act as crude oil in the same refinement infrastructure that we currently have setup for petroleum.</p>
<p>For those unaware, because we would be producing oil from algae, such an energy source is considered <span class="bbcode-i">carbon neutral</span>, meaning that we are neither adding nor subtracting carbon from the atmosphere while using that method. The minuses is that the algal farms take a lot of upkeep and equipment and, of course, a ton of land. Nevertheless, the production of a barrel of algal oil is drawing pretty close to that of a barrel of petroleum. Since petrol is going up and algal is going down, I’m pretty sure which one will win within the next few years. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Now, the reason I’m a big fan of algal oil is because it allows us to stop increasing greenhouse gases from petroleum consumption while we work on even more efficient solutions (such as cars that get more miles per gallon) or using nuclear power plants instead of coal. Hell, we could even burn switch grass, which is one of the fastest growing plants that we’re aware of (it’s a good candidate for replacing corn in the production of ethanol).</p>
<p>There’s definitely plenty to consider. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>Algal oil is something I’ve never really looked into if I’m honest, but I do know the principles behind it and what drive the idea forward and you’ve hit the nail on the head with it right there. I do like the idea of using Algal oil, but as I stated before I don’t think it’s enough to sustain the earth by itself by the time we have left.</p>
<p>What would be your secondary or even tertiary solution?</p>

<p>These are usually not in place because the money to create them isn’t there. Also, no-one wants to be the first to do something, because if they fail it’s a loss of millions or even billions of dollars on this. Society doesn’t like change, if they were to change their gas from petroleum to algal oil, it’d cause an uproar. So if that company fails, that uproar comes back on their head.</p>

<p>Well, considering most major oil companies have R&amp;D departments researching the practicalities of algal oil, I wouldn’t be so sure on your claims that “society doesn’t change.” They have to change. If even one company starts up selling algal oil for cheaper than gas, they will run the petrol industry out of business. The only option for those companies is to evolve or die.</p>
<p>Besides that, I think you missed the point of carbon neutrality. My point was, we can spend far more time researching alternative solutions to gasoline while using algal oil, instead of petrol. We wouldn’t be impacting the earth while driving with algal oil, so why is it such a bad thing to continue using it for a while?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/ruby-2.html">@Ruby</a>: my secondary solution would be pure hydrogen vehicles. Hydrogen vehicles are generally built to be safer than a lot of modern gasoline vehicles (where they have a safety valve to expel the hydrogen if the tank is ever ruptured, plus the tank that holds the hydrogen can be dropped from like 8 stories and be perfectly fine). Hydrogen-electric powered cars allow people to drive for thousands of miles on a single tank of hydrogen. Beyond that, if you still wanted to use gasoline, there are catalyst systems that convert gasoline directly to hydrogen without using combustion. Combine that with algal oil and we would bypass the need for a super safe hydrogen tank and reduce the amount of oil consumption, even if it is renewable and carbon neutral. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>I actually really like the hydrogen idea. However, pressurised gas is still pressurised gas. I know it’s safe and made a lot safer than needs to be, but after all, it’s still a pressurised gas.</p>

I know wind power is much cheaper than solar power, unless you consider some of the most recent solar power advances (I think it was like Ohio University or Indiana or something that created a solar panel that was like 90% efficient, nuts). A big turnoff with wind is the costs of the turbines, too. With a more efficient solar panel, you’d pay it off a lot faster than the turbine. I think solar is the way to go for renewable energy, but it’s complicated.</p>
<p>Wave power is very interesting, but as far as I recall, extremely expensive to setup. I love the idea though, because it’s a way to harness energy from the ocean, where we can’t have wind turbines or solar panels. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

        <p>Yeah, you have the general idea there :P.</p>
<p>Wind turbines are my favourite, seeing as I’m generally better with heights than I am with oceans, but I just put up with it haha. We have a wave power module near where we are, owned by Babcock at the dockyard and that is pretty fucking cool. It’s like 100-120metres long and looks like something out of transformers haha. I’ve seen it a few times when they’ve taken it out to perform maintenance that the engineers couldn’t perform under water. Obviously I’ve seen pictures/videos of them seeing as I deal with them, but seeing it in person is 100 times more impressive.</p>
<p>I have a wind turbine in my garden, down the bottom. It cost us £5995 and it generates a fair amount of electricity. They’re definitely worth buying.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Taharok, post:2, topic:450456”]I’ve done a few school term papers on certain types of renewable energies. There are a lot more solutions out there than most people realize. For example, my personal favorite is algal oil (that is, oil derived from cultures of specific species of algae). Algal oil is immensely fascinating. They are able to produce it in large quantities and in short time periods (don’t quote me, but I think they can gather something like 70% of the oil from the cultures every day before starting a new culture). What’s more fascinating is, the phosolipids from the algae form the same hydrocarbon structure as petroleum, which means that algal oil can act as crude oil in the same refinement infrastructure that we currently have setup for petroleum.</p>
<p>For those unaware, because we would be producing oil from algae, such an energy source is considered <span class="bbcode-i">carbon neutral</span>, meaning that we are neither adding nor subtracting carbon from the atmosphere while using that method. The minuses is that the algal farms take a lot of upkeep and equipment and, of course, a ton of land. Nevertheless, the production of a barrel of algal oil is drawing pretty close to that of a barrel of petroleum. Since petrol is going up and algal is going down, I’m pretty sure which one will win within the next few years. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Now, the reason I’m a big fan of algal oil is because it allows us to stop increasing greenhouse gases from petroleum consumption while we work on even more efficient solutions (such as cars that get more miles per gallon) or using nuclear power plants instead of coal. Hell, we could even burn switch grass, which is one of the fastest growing plants that we’re aware of (it’s a good candidate for replacing corn in the production of ethanol).</p>
<p>There’s definitely plenty to consider. :P[/quote]<br>
My favorite alternative fuel source is hemp, I love to smoke it’s cousin, cannabis, and it’s another great, carbon neutral way to produce energy.<br>
It also pretty much grows everywhere and grows quite fast, hence the name weed.</p>

Is your wind turbine sufficient to power all appliances in your house, or do you have to use electricity from the grid as well?</p>

        <p>We need to use some energy from the grid, but the turbine powers our entire garage and man-cave. The garage is more or less a mini-gym with our motorbikes and cars in it. Then the man-cave is where me and my brothers/dad and our friends all watch football and shit, there’s 2 fridges, a 50" tv, tivo box and a laptop in it and all that’s turned most of the time. So it does power a fair bit.</p>
<p>I did make some tweaks to the turbine, I adjusted the pitch of the blades, the height and I changed the gearing inside it, other than that, it’s standard.</p>
<p>Along with all of those methods, people are seeing more and more biogas plants popping up, they’re pretty damn useful, but it takes like 40 years to create a good site, which isn’t ideal.</p>

Someone said something about algae.</p>

<p>Farmed fuel is not the solution, we need to soil for food farming, not burning in out cars.</p>
<p>If you place wind turbines at the sea it would not be a visual problem and there would be a lot more effect than placing it on land. The sea has big a areal that can’t be used to much. So let us use that, and not killing people by occupy their farmlands.</p>

Wind mills at sea isn’t a danger to the things that live under water, just to stupid birds that fly into them.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, those stupid birds. They deserve to die.</p>

        <p>The main problem with flying objects and wind turbines isn’t actually birds, it’s flies. They stick everything up and they’re a nightmare. Also, if you put a wind farm out in the sea, it costs more to run a team through their HUET training, then get a helicopter to fly them out and in quickly. Also you need to train them in rappeling down to the top and working inside. Whereas, if they’re on shore they don’t need the whole HUET training and getting the helicopter, they just need a car and some tools.</p>

        <p>Ruby: The reason for off-shore wind turbines it more wind and less visual impact. It cost 2.2 Milliards DKK (360 million USD) for off-shore wind turbines that could produce enough electricity to power 150.000 Danish homes. You would get the money back pretty soon.</p>
