    <description>This entire post is just to open up a discussion on your thoughts and feelings about the pros and cons of sustainable/renewable energy.

I&#39;ll start us off.

There&#39;s no doubt that sustainable energy sources are a must, we can no longer keep ourselves living from oil, which is rapidly depleting. We must find a different way. Que renewable/sustainable energy. This is but a name given to a wide number of solutions, which none of the solutions alone will be able to hold the energy demand for the entire world, they must be used together. For example, wind power. I&#39;ve been offshore and visited wind turbines, and believe me, they do a damn good job. However, they cannot hold the Earths demand for energy alone. Wind power, most commonly wind turbines, are easily maintained compared to some other types of renewable engineering solutions. They are also relatively cheap, you can get your own wind turbine for £2000 from the local hardware store. If you have a general knowledge of mechanical and  electrical engineering, you can create your own easily enough. The downfall of wind turbines is that the older residents of the area you&#39;re erecting them in generally disapprove. They believe they&#39;re an eyesore, but I don&#39;t think they realise the potential they hold.

What say you, moparscape?</description>

I had an idea, although it may be impossible. Electrons travel around the nucleus randomly, but very fast. If somehow we could harness that kinetic energy, our energy source problems would be solved forever. Just an idea.<br>

Wouldn’t that make the atoms very unstable? Modifying atoms in that way may cause a similar reaction to nuclear waste? I know the reactions are very different but if you know how the nuclear process works it should kind of make sense.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re not 100% wrong there, I done Higher physics, and now I’m doing a masters degree in it at Napier, lol. The atoms would become very, very unstable and could potentially become dangerous, yes.</p>

<p>I know very little about physics, Scotland - credit level physics if that makes any sense to you but…<br>

I could be completely wrong though, its just a theory and I have little knowledge so excuse me if its dumb :L.<br>

It all depends on how you harness the kinetic energy. I didn’t give any proposition as to how I would do it, so I don’t see how you came to the assumption that I would modify the atom. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> What exactly do you have in mind? I also don’t know the speed of an electron, as it may be moving too slow… since electrons weigh so little. But then again you could have 6.022 x 10[sup]21[/sup] atoms of carbon in 6 grams. Leading to 36.13 x 10[sup]22[/sup] electrons. :P[/quote]</p>
<p>The problem with this is that for different elements, there’s different orbital velocities, the heavier elemnt the slower the velocity. The rough rule is that the electron’s classical speed is about the charge it “sees” divided by 137. The electron might see more or less of the nuclear charge depending on whether it’s closer or farther from the nucleus. This once again, could become dangerous.</p>
<p>[quote=“jme, post:47, topic:450456”]These days it makes sense to get solar panels for your house. They are easily affordable now, and actually profitable as you can sell the power back to the grid for the same price you pay for it. Plus in many places the government will practically pay for them by tax benefits. People with creeks or rivers on their properties are getting small turbines which are ideal since there is a steady flow of water. Also interesting is geothermal drilling. Free heat in the winter, free a/c in the summer. I was in a house with a geothermal system recently, and the house was freezing cold in minutes.</p>
<p>And than these are interesting. <a href="http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/scientists-harvest-solar-power-in-the-dark/4150%5B/quote%5D" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/scientists-harvest-solar-power-in-the-dark/4150[/quote]</a></p>
<p>I have a small underwater turbine rig me and my brother built (we’re both trained in mechanical engineering) to harness the power of the river running through my garden, it works a treat. We also have 4 wind turbines down the bottom of the garden, which were built by us also. His main base is chemical engineering whereas mines is environmental engineering; both require mechanical engineering skills. The windturbines don’t really churn out much, maybe .2/.3 of an amp. Which for a home-made wind turbine is pretty good, since the motors aren’t actually made for that. The only way of which we could make the motors we used work better is to add a gearing system to them, but that’s just not worth it. The underwater turbine however churns out between 2 and 3 amps, depending on the current of the water, which is extremely good for home-made equipment.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even take all that much of an engineering knowledge to create any of those, the only bit that really tried us was optimizing the underwater turbine, other than that it was more or less plain-sailing. Anyone who’s studied Electrical and Mechanical engineering for about 3 months would be able to do it. It’s also great fun.</p>
<p>We have a geothermal pump in our lake house, it was 110% worth the money to have it fitted, definitely recommend it to anyone who looks for engineering solutions.</p>

If you can produce energy from it, the turbine would have a force working opposite of the direction of the rotation. It would therefore stop when the total energy output equals to the kinetic energy in the rotation.</p>

I had an idea, although it may be impossible. Electrons travel around the nucleus randomly, but very fast. If somehow we could harness that kinetic energy, our energy source problems would be solved forever. Just an idea.<br>

I know very little about physics, Scotland - credit level physics if that makes any sense to you but…<br>
Wouldn’t that make the atoms very unstable? Modifying atoms in that way may cause a similar reaction to nuclear waste? I know the reactions are very different but if you know how the nuclear process works it should kind of make sense.<br>
I could be completely wrong though, its just a theory and I have little knowledge so excuse me if its dumb :L.[/quote]<br>
It all depends on how you harness the kinetic energy. I didn’t give any proposition as to how I would do it, so I don’t see how you came to the assumption that I would modify the atom. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> What exactly do you have in mind? I also don’t know the speed of an electron, as it may be moving too slow… since electrons weigh so little. But then again you could have 6.022 x 10[sup]21[/sup] atoms of carbon in 6 grams. Leading to 36.13 x 10[sup]22[/sup] electrons. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

What about all that cooking oil. I know you can convert your car to use it (Mythbusters). And you get some insane gas millage.

<p>That’s expensive and not really all that cost effective, it takes a lot of money to take your car from being a regular petroleum running car to run on bio diesel.

It’s a good quick fix if you have the money but it’ll bite you in the ass in the long run.[/quote]<br>
Er… Mythbusters did it for cheap, because they literally tell you step by step how to do it. Because of the mileage they got. I think they got around 60mpgs with an old used junk car. Here let me see if i can pull up a youtube video or something,<br>
Edit:<br>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="QEX1YFXYTdI" data-youtube-title="Mythbusters - Cooking Oil as Economical Diesel Fuel" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>I was wrong on the 50+mpgs. It was 30mpg (10% less then the diesel).<br>
And they did nothing but filter the cooking oil.</p>

Ruby: The reason for off-shore wind turbines it more wind and less visual impact. It cost 2.2 Milliards DKK (360 million USD) for off-shore wind turbines that could produce enough electricity to power 150.000 Danish homes. You would get the money back pretty soon.<br>

<p>I know where you’re coming from, but windfarms at sea are much harder to erect and much harder to maintain. I’m part of a maintenance team which is a seven man outfit, because I’m at university through my job, the days I have off, they have me working. I’m still only an apprentice just going into my second year, but I do work in a team, when I work. I’m more on the mechanical side of things than anything else, in our team there’s 2 mechanical engineers, 2 electrical engineers, a labourer, the team leader and a fibre optics engineer. To train all of us offshore, that costs around two thousand british pounds, so two thousand times 7, you get 14000 pounds, just for that one team. You then have to pay us, the majority of my team is on 60+k per annum, the team leader is double that. You then have to buy a helicopter, or at least lease it from a company. You then have to hire a helicopter pilot, or employ one. You then have to get a team that erects wind turbines, train all of them for off shore work. You then have to rent huge boats to carry the parts out to see. You then have to get sea cranes and operators plus crews for the boats.[/quote]<br>
I assume the 2.2 Millard DKK includes every cost of building them. When it comes to maintenance the math is pretty simple.<br>
For that sum you get 80 wind turbines and power to 150.000 Danish homes. So how many wind turbines can you maintain i a four week period?</p>
