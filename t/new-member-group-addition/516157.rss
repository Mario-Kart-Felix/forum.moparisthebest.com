    <description>The staff team is happy to announce that a new member group has been introduced to Moparscape. From now, members shall be able to obtain the &#39;Community Member&#39; status for Moparscape (separate to the Moparisthebest status).

We hope to see members added to the group within the coming days, so bear with us. :)

<p>That’s such a terrible analogy, for one being inactive on an online forum doesn’t affect anything negatively, being inactive in a job means you aren’t doing your job (duh) which obviously affects the workplace negatively…</p>

As far as I’m aware there was no fix found that worked.</p>

<p>As for the inactive staff members, I’ve came to realize that it doesn’t hurt, and it doesn’t hurt us. I’m sure a lot of these “inactive members” work behind the scenes without even posting so most of us act like we know what they’re doing behind these scenes. At this point, it doesn’t matter…</p>

<p>I think my favorite part is that there is so much complaining about elitism and epenis on this site, so much so that we do things like hide the vet rank, remove reputation, hide the IRC award, and things like that, and now we get a ‘new’ rank that pretty much screams popularity contest. Moparscape seems to be a lot like the tides :rolleyes:</p>

<p>'twas a joke. quality&gt;quantity.</p>
<p>Additionally, <span class="mention">@topic</span>, although meaning similar things, we are all in the community, making community member simply a poorly sounding group. Veteran makes it seem like you’ve been there and you’ve made an impact. That’s what being a part of the forums is, not just a “member”, but a vet; hell, even legend.</p>

<p>As for the inactive staff, I stand by the view that they do no harm to the community. If we need more moderators, then we will seek more moderators regardless of inactive staff. They have no effect on the community while they’re inactive, and only do good when they are active. As others has stated, staff aren’t paid and we don’t have timetables, this has led a lot of staff to prioritize their life leaving less time for mopar which is completely reasonable.</p>
