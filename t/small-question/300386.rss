    <description>Alright, i have cannons on my server working with only 3 glitches, they dont show action, dont acually deal damage like it shows, and anybody can pick it up. That last one i mentioned is the one i want help fixing mainly, for the specific perpous of steeling someone cannon on my server. How can i make it so that when someone sets up an object, it assigns the object to them?</description>
