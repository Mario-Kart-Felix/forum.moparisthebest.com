    <description>[b]For development progress updates, please visit my blog. This is what helps raise money for a dedicated host, by simply viewing:[/b] [url=http://sinscape-rsps.blogspot.co.uk/]http://sinscape-rsps.blogspot.co.uk/[/url]

Hello. I am here to show you the progress of a Hyperion #474 RSPS development project. The source is a derivative of the &quot;Rs2-Serber&quot; release by Scu11 and Vastico, simply called &quot;Rs2-Serber Edit&quot; by winter2000. I am now continuing their work under the name &quot;SinScape&quot;.

[b][u]Primary ambitions and ethics:[/u][/b]

[ul][li][b]A new way to fund a dedicated host;[/b] asking for donations is always something I&#39;ve been against. So, as an alternative, I am going to keep a blog of my development where I plan to set-up a Google Adsense account in the near future. I am also going to make use of another websites referral system, that pays me to refer other people to register with them. I can then use this money to buy a dedicated server for you all to play. Raising the funds this way helps avoid any controversy regarding owners using donations for anything but the server.[/li]
[li][b]Strong economy;[/b] shop stock and monster drops will be carefully analysed. Everything will be taken into consideration when implementing items to provide fun game-play and a balanced economy.[/li]
[li][b]Equality;[/b] no donator rank or membership regimes. This helps avoid any &quot;I&#39;m better than you&quot; conflicts. Every player (including moderators) are treated the same.[/li]
[li][b]Community focused;[/b] a non-profit community that listens to what it&#39;s members want, handles disputes in a formal, non-biased manner, has regular events and always finds time to help the needy. No one is left out.[/li]
[li][b]Management;[/b] a completely diverse way of managing account security, rule-breakers and general server statistics. Text logs of all kinds, so that there is always some form of evidence for handling problems such as a loss of account or some form of bug abuse.[/li][/ul]



These are just a few initial ideas I have in mind whilst I develop the server and build up an audience/community. [b]Some other features will include:[/b]

[ul][li]A vast amount of obtainable items;[/li]
[li]Detailed and diverse skills to train;[/li]
[li]Unique dungeons and other areas of the map to explore;[/li]
[li]New and exciting monsters to slay;[/li]
[li]Game-play that is not too easy, not too hard;[/li]
[li]Quality support - you are always an equally valued customer, no matter what;[/li]
[li]And always much, much more...[/li][/ul]


The overall plan for the next few months is to build, optimise and test aspects of the game, post regular updates (every day), to build up a big enough audience and hope for a small amount of income to fund a small, dedicated host, to utilize social networking and the works to attract a larger audience, maintain a steady follower base so that it brings a kick start to the community and in-game economy until I am finally ready to open up the game to the public.

So for now, if you are interested in this type of server, why not show your support on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and the forums by liking and/or following, so you can be informed of any updates.

Thanks for reading, and feedback is welcome. All further updates will be posted on my blog, so if you are interested in viewing them I will post a link each time I create a new entry. You can visit the blog here: http://sinscape-rsps.blogspot.co.uk/</description>

<p>Why no 474 maps? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>u make asshole rool sad.[/quote]<br>
Aw, I don’t like making people sad. If I said I can make this server with 317 maps (474 models, textures, items, NPCs and objects) better than what I could make it with 474 corrupt maps (no walls on buildings etc.), would that make you feel better?<br>

<p>Well there have been recreated versions of 474 maps, you could load those.</p>

<p>After £10, you can request a payout. I’m going to keep them with Google until the server is ready. I must (have to) say, keep the clicks legit. This is a much better way than asking for donations from your players, I must say.</p>

<p>Edit: Clicked the ad a total of about 20 Times today.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, holy shit.</p>
<p>£3.36<br>
Today so far</p>
<p>£8.96<br>
Yesterday</p>
<p>£17.54<br>
This month so far.</p>
<p>After £10, you can request a payout. I’m going to keep them with Google until the server is ready. I must (have to) say, keep the clicks legit. This is a much better way than asking for donations from your players, I must say.</p>
<p>Also, working on a new blog entry for tonight.</p>
