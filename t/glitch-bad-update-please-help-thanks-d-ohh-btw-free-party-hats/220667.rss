    <description>ok my server was going along fine no glitches then i changed the starting hit point xp when you log in to 750 (lowest i could get to make you level 3) and set the level to 99, now when you log in no matter what hp level you are you start with 10 hps. 


its in somthing wrong in cleint.java i tested with some backups it might be somthing wrong with my xp rate i changed it to what you hit got ride of that usless one hit 99 shit. yes i did repost this my last thread started a flame war =D im awsome huh? and all you hater, blow me. im not stupid i know what im doing, just can&#39;t figure the problem out. if it&#39;s any way possible i&#39;d like to keep my xp rates the same, if not thats fine. only other thing i did to day was add an system update command

like runescape it says system update in the cornor and counts down, and when hits 0:00 kicks everybody off and won&#39;t let them log on till i close my run server and open again (spossed to happen). NO IM NOT REALEASING.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 16, 2008, 02:03:26 AM[/size][hr]help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111</description>
