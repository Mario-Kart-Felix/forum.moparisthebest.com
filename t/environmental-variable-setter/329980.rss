    <title>Environmental Variable Setter</title>

    <description>NOTE: This topic is for using this as a tool; the one in the general programming section is for the actual programming of this tool.

Well, this is actually an application to help the people who can&#39;t set Environmental Variables for Java (The PATH and CLASSPATH variables), it automatically detects the version of the JDK they have installed and sets the variables using that.

Unless you feel like manually compiling this from the command line, or making your own makefile, you&#39;ll need SCons.

<p>You are probably aware that this has been attempted at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,375681.0.html">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,375681.0.html</a> however you still have to manually click your jdk directory while yours is completely automatic.</p>
<p>ps, I know you’re learning C but this could be done much easier with a higher level language.[/quote]lol I just copied and pasted the one from the C++ section XD lmao.</p>
<p>Plus, mine doesn’t use .NET, and yea, I agree it could be;  but that defeats me using C <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
