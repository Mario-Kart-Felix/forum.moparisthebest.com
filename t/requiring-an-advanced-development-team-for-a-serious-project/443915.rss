[size=13pt][b]Welcome, MoparScape, to my development team thread![/b][/size]
[/center]
[hr]

Okay, so for the past few weeks I&#39;ve been thinking about opening up another server, and I have came to the conclusion that I&#39;m going to do it. The only problem is, I&#39;m very bad with Java programming. I&#39;m mainly a website developer, I don&#39;t know very much at all about java. So I need a development team to even get started. I&#39;m sick and tired of seeing these servers that are 317 loading 600+ and what not, and I&#39;m sick and tired of seeing PI everywhere. I want this server to be renowned for being the server people talk about and want to be like. Not only within the programming side of RSPS, but also the player side. I know that as a previous server owner, players don&#39;t necessarily require huge amounts of content and all-new never-before-seen content. Players generally look for stability and a nice, knowledgeable community, this is what I&#39;m willing to provide. I&#39;m also sick and tired of seeing kids who are only hosting their servers for the money gained from them, this wasn&#39;t the sole purpose that RuneScape Private Servers were brought into this world for. They&#39;re used for fun, not for money. These are only some of the aspects I&#39;d be incorporating into Xythax.


[b]Why should we work beside you?[/b]

I&#39;ve been around MoparScape for the best part of a year now, and I&#39;ve watched private servers develop over the years. MoparScape/Moparisthebest.com has always been the only community I use, because I like what it stands for. I now call upon the people who are also &quot;loyal&quot; in a sense of the word, to MoparScape. I speak for a huge amount of us when I say it is horrid when I see a 317 server loading a high cache. I&#39;m also fed up of seeing kids just download a server, add 3 commands and re-release it. What I want to achieve is a good, stable server, which is friendly for everyone playing. I want it to be 317, loading no higher than 508. By this, I mean a hyperion/apollo source totally written into perfection. I&#39;d also happily release it with all credits to the Xythax Development Team, just to give something back to the MoparScape community, this will obviously be the decision of our entire development team.


[b]Why do you post this now?[/b]
Well, it just so happens I&#39;ve came into a bit of money lately. I have around a 200$ budget to  get this server started, I&#39;ve already bought the domain and a hosting package and uploaded the homepage. This link will be given upon request until I get verified by a moderator to display it. I believe that with 200$, we could buy even a 30-40$ vps for the first month, buy gold server status on a few toplists and get an advertisement. I think with that, we&#39;d gain a good starting base of players. Any money gained by this server through donations and such, will be kept in my paypal and will [b]only be used for the server[/b].


[b]How can I apply?[/b]
You can apply by filling out the following application. As stated in the title, I do not want programmers who are new to Java, this calls for experience and dedication from people who know where I&#39;m coming from and have an obvious set of goals. These people must also be very trustworthy, and will have respect for the other members of the team and their ideas. You must be mature and willing to devote as much of your time as possible. I respect that in the U.S that there are still final exams and stuff going on, this can be excused.

Here&#39;s the application form:
[code]
Name:
Age:
Experience:
Proof of experience:
Skype/MSN:
Do you use DropBox:
Preferred base to use:
Can you work well with others:
[/code]

I will keep checking on this post every hour or so to check applications and try and recruit as many developers as needed. I will also fill out the below staff list to let you know the spaces that are left.

Thanks for taking the time to read through all of that, I appreciate it was a long-winded way of writing it, but I had to get my whole point and idea across. I did not mean to offend anyone who is new to Java programming, but I do require experience in this project, however, you are more than welcome to use our community.

Many thanks, Ruby.</description>

Wait, just a few months ago, you were advertising your need for developers on a <span class="bbcode-b">317 PI</span> project,<span class="bbcode-b"> loading 632</span>. I find it a little ironic that you are now saying:</p>

That was only loading 632 items, for nothing other than the reason of a better pking experience.</p>

Wait, just a few months ago, you were advertising your need for developers on a <span class="bbcode-b">317 PI</span> project,<span class="bbcode-b"> loading 632</span>. I find it a little ironic that you are now saying:</p>
<blockquote>I'm sick and tired of seeing these servers that are 317 loading 600+ and what not, and I'm sick and tired of seeing PI everywhere.</blockquote>
<p>Good luck.</p>
