    <title>Agent of socialization</title>

    <description>Hey,

Note: I am away for a while from these forums but not that long. Anyways, on with the question. When I return to school apparently there is this big assignment, and well we have to debate against topics that we were assigned.

My topic basically said that we are all puppets at school for the government. The government controls our curriculum, and sets the rules and regulations. We have no choice at school and everything we do is government controlled. My goal is to debate against this. So some points that I thought of are things like, &quot;Even though the government may have set some mandatory courses, there are over 25 courses each year to choose from with a difficulty level of our choice.&quot;

I assure you I have more, and probably better points then this. However I would really like some help, so any suggestions would be appreciated. Don&#39;t be afraid to speak your mind, this is a sociology assignment after all ;) So to re-cap everything, I am looking for points to prove that our life at school is not 100% controlled by the government. Even obvious points are appreciated.

Thanks.

See, my partner is always nagging at me for slacking. We&#39;re like people who love to hate each other. And even though maybe I am not earning the work completely honestly when I get it from you guys, I still wan&#39;t to impress her and have a lot of points and everything and get most of the work done.</description>

So you love to hate her and like her anyway?<br>
Also, I thought about it for about 10 minutes, but I can’t see why the government wouldn’t be controlling everything. [/quote]<br>
It’s complicated, it’s not a “like” thing.</p>
<p>Anyways, to maybe help other’s help me I’ll give some more examples.</p>
<p>It is up to us how punctual we are, how much we want to learn, which courses we want to take, the difficulty level that we take them at, how motivated we are, we can drop school at age 16, etc. The government sets things up but it’s up to us to participate and be involved.</p>
<p>Part of this assignment is to be incredibly biased. We cannot support the other side in any way.</p>
