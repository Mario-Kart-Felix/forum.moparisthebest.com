    <title>Java Based Game with exquisite detail</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-based-game-with-exquisite-detail/554403</link>
    <description>Is it possible, without an uneccisary amount of file shrinkage to create a game in java that is client based, like that of runescape, but a totally independent entity?  I mean using the same game engine client altaring of course full screen mode constantly enabled and to have it in a way that wouldn&#39;t limit those who don&#39;t have a great graphics card to run it?  I don&#39;t know if this is the right place to be posting this, but I&#39;d like to know if what I am aiming for is possible, before I dedicate any time to it.</description>

              <p>How would I go about setting up a suitable engine then?  Or atleast determining the engine required to operate without latency?  Also, would it be possible to introduce a game, java based with a sql linked to an offline mode game?  In other words, a f2p mode for offline use, and a p2p mode for online multiplayer use?</p>
