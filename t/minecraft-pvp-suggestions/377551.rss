    <title>Minecraft PVP suggestions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-pvp-suggestions/377551</link>
    <description>I heard that PVP was coming out for minecraft, and if these are possible to add in, I think they would be pretty neat.

1: Kill rewards
(all of these must be consecutive)
       • For 3 kills, you get 1 iron
       • For 5 kills, you get 3 iron
       • For 10 kills, you get a gold block (9 gold bars put into one square)
       • For 20 kills, you get a diamond block (similar to the aforementioned, but with diamond)
       • Preset items (you do not bring your own items, you are set with regular armor, and it will advance as you get more kills)
             a. These preset items would not advance after iron, just incase someone gets diamond, and kills every new person they come across.

2: PVP Arena
I have already posted this in a different thread, but I think there should be an arena for PVP and would be the only place to pvp.
       • /PVP to go there, and 10 seconds of waiting time after a kill.
       • Should be made purely of Adminium (owners can spawn it)
       • A spectator area where regular players can /spectate. There would be glass blocking them from interfering with the battle, and it would work similar to the spawn zone where it will regenerate if someone destroys it.

If you do not agree with any of these, please comment [b]why[/b] you do not.</description>

              <p>I think the best bet is to keep the mods to a minimum, as it’s updated quite frequently and the mods all have to be updated each time as well.</p>

<p>I prefer consecutive, because there would be nothing to work for.</p>
