              <p>Dylan is right Arc, the only reasons you started with primitives is because i made a video tut, showing that yes, cubes can actually become a blade, and such. Please, do not insult a method that you once used, and were treated well for, your becoming a small bit full of yourself imo, because your models were never really made for quality, just speed, and color. Some of them weren’t even built for color.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@TOPIC</span> - Well, i would have started with something a little different, but thats just me, we all gotta start somewhere right? Im glad to see someone new around here, some ‘fresh meat’ as i like to call it, rofl. As for the model, its not bad, i would say 7/10 for your first, only because i can see a missing face in the first pic, but its not bad, keep working at it.</p>

You can go easy on him. YOU were a tracer. YOU traced everything. YOU didnt like primitives. YOU thought they were stupid and useless.<br>
YOU shouldnt insult the method you first used. I can, because I never used the trace method, and never plan to. Stop acting like your ‘the shit’ please…</p>
<p>About the model: Its OK for a first. Not amazing. Not the worst. As Arcanian said(in a mean way) “its just a trace”. Try primitive modelling. Oh, this would make an (ok) shield</p>
