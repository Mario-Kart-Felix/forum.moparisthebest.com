              <p>Well if you still don’t know how to do this, or for the few people out there that want to know, here is step by step on what you have to do to make a new shop from scratch.</p>
<p>This is for 317’s (NOT DELTA):</p>
<p>Go into your autospawn.cfg file, and put in the NPC you want.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 86	0	0	0	0	0	1	Giant Rat</code></pre>
<p>What that code is saying is to spawn the NPC with the ID of 86, which in this case happens to be a giant rat. Then at the very end, you can put a description so you can refer to it later, and it makes it easier finding stuff later on when you are changing things around.</p>
<p>Next, go into your shops.cfg file, and put what items you want in it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 69	2	2	391	100	6570	20</code></pre>
<p>What this is saying is that, when the shop linked to number 69 is queued, it will then open up a shop with 100 of Item 391 (Manta Rays) and 20 of Item 6570 (Fire Cape). You can put more than that if you want more than those items in the shop, I just put those there for an example. Just remember it goes ID, Quantity, ID, Quantity.</p>
<p>Now, go into your client.java file, and search “wanneshop”<br>
You should see some other codes that look similar to this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (NPCID == ####) { // Description
    PutNPCCoords = true;
    WanneShop = ##; // Description
}</code></pre>
<p>All you have to do is where it says “NPCID == ####”, where the "#"s are, put in the NPC ID that you put in the autospawn.cfg file. Then for the “WannaShop”, put in the shop number you want for that NPC to have.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = # &lt;-- This is what you need to put in after WanneShop =</code></pre>
<p>After that, save all files that you edited (autospawn.cfg, shop.cfg, client.java), compile, and restart your server.</p>
<p>NOTE: Please make sure that when you are editing files in a cfg format, that you use tabs and not spaces. If you use spaces, you will get errors.</p>
<p>If you have any problems, send me a PM.</p>

              <p>Well I might as well try and help since I posted here.</p>
<p>IF you already have an existing shop, open up shops.cfg and you’ll see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 48	Rares Shop!			2	2	1038	100	1040	100	1042	100	1044	100	1046	100	1048	100	1050	100	1053	100	1055	100	1057	100	6862	100	6860	100	6856	100	6858	100	6857	100	6859	100	6861	100	6863	100	2994	100	2992	100	2990	100	14519	100	14521	100	14520	100	3486	100	3481	100	3483	100	3485	100	3488	100	6623	100	6617	100	6625	100	6627	100	6633	100	14116    100</code></pre>
<p>I’ll explain what everything means in here.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = [ShopID]	[ShopName]			[ShopType (1 or 2)]	[ShopType (1 or 2)]	[ItemID]	[ItemAmount]	[ItemID]	[ItemAmount]	[ItemID]	[ItemAmount]</code></pre>
<p>And so on, and so on, and so on. Compare what I just did to what it is above it. The shop type 1 I think makes it so you can’t sell any kind of item to that shop unless that shop contains that item? And 2 is basically general store, you can sell anything to it.</p>
<p>EDIT: REMEMBER TO ALWAYS USE TABS! Do not use spaces or you’ll get errors when you compile or it just wont work.</p>
