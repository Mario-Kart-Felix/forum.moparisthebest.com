    <title>My RuneScape History</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-runescape-history/338867</link>
    <description>Oh man, this is going to be long.

I was first introduced to RuneScape in early.. 2004? When I was in 4th grade. I had moved to a new school and I didn&#39;t have many friends, but of the few were Cam &amp; Brooke. They kept telling me about RuneScape and I didn&#39;t know what it was but I really wanted to play but I didn&#39;t have a computer set up in my house. There was a group of kids that I saw at recess playing &quot;vampire tag&quot; (google it) and I always thought they were the coolest. After awhile, I finally got a computer and loaded up RuneScape. It took like an hour to load and once it was loaded I realized I had to go back and create an account, lol. The first one I made didn&#39;t work for some reason but the second one I made worked and from that day on it was love.

That week sometime I told Cam and Brooke that I had made an account, and they told me to go on at like 6:30 so I did, and that&#39;s when I was introduced to the group of kids I thought were really cool. Throughout elementary school we all played RuneScape and I got to be really good friends with this group of kids and we all did tons of different events in the game together. 

Once we got into Middle School most of my friends that played quit, and it was really only me and my other friend that still played. (Not much more I can write about that, so I&#39;ll move on.)

In late 7th Grade, I was introduced to Private Servers. I caught on slowly and eventually released a few that lasted not very long.  I started looking into the darker side of RS, bots, account buying, services, etc, but never actually made a deal. 

I soon found myself playing the game alone, my friend who still played had quit for another game.

In 9th grade I spent over 200$ in RuneScape pins to sell to other players, and I got a great deal for 3 month pin. The account had 99 Mage and Ranged, and I started making RSMV&#39;s. 

Then one day I go to log in and I find out... My account&#39;s locked. I have as much info as I can but the request was denied. :[

Now I play on my old account, no 99&#39;s, nothing really that good. I&#39;m working on getting something 99 LEGIT, probably Hunter as I hear it&#39;s easy and fast. 

Kind of lame story, but I want to go play RuneScape lol.</description>
