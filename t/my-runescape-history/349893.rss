    <title>My RuneScape History</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-runescape-history/349893</link>
    <description>Well.. I think I should share my beautiful experience too.

Okay, so it all started when I logged in. When I logged in, there was some retarded guy.. so I spoke to him, and he&#39;s all like &quot;welcz to scaperune, this 1 is tutz land, go do tutz n cum back on me, and speak to my face&quot;

so.. after 3 long days, I finished that tutorial and was welcomed into the world of RuneScape.

Once there, I found my self in some retarded castle in a place called &quot;lumberjackbridge&quot;.. I then fell over a rock but to surprise I saw a person named zizema with a PHat on saying &quot;Take my hand&quot;, with his colorful hat shining. I said &quot;can i trust you&quot;, and he said &quot;Don&#39;t worry, my hand is level 99.&quot; I didn&#39;t know what it mean&#39;t at the time, but he was talking to beautifully, it was like he had a level 99 voice or something. Anyways, once up he said follow me, so I followed, he then took me into this dark place called the wilderness and took me far, far, far, we encountered these wierd nigger ghost, which he defeated himself, while protecting me. 

He then killed me. I found myself back where I started.. so I just logged off, and haven&#39;t logged on since. Don&#39;t ask how the fuck I got to this site..</description>

              <p>I was in 6th grade 2006, April 9th to be exact, all my good friends where talking about this game called “RoomSkate” (I didn’t know it was RuneScape) I said it sounded stupid, I was talking to one of my closest friends Tyler about it and he gave me the website, next day at the bookfair whe had every semester I was on the library computer and made my first account “Doggy36” played on the tutorial, quit that for a few days, then on April 15th I got my first own computer and decided to play RuneScape again, so I made a new account “Natecole4” played that for a few days, quit that, then around April 20th my friend asked if I wanted a level 12 account with some black stuff on it, I took it and that was my main from 2006-2008 (I still have it too) I quit him once my good friend Nate (LOL) and I started sharing our old account, Nest81, we also shared his staker account Som 1s b4ck and his main Aclaw (ranked <span class="hashtag">#1</span> attack) after his 2 accounts got keylogged we got nest81 from level 76-96 in a whole summer, then that account got locked for chargeback fees and is locked.<br>
My current main Pker0000888 was my dads girlfriends sons and I account, we made it to share and work on together, which is one of my current 2 mains.<br>
We’ve made that account pretty bad-ass, so that’s ny story o.-</p>
<p>Here are my mains:<br>
