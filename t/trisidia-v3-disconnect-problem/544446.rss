    <title>Trisidia V3 Disconnect Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trisidia-v3-disconnect-problem/544446</link>
    <description>A couple months ago, I downloaded the Trisidia V3 Source/Client and began tinkering with it. Eventually, I got a VPS and got it online. A couple of friends and I were playing it when we realized that every time we engaged in combat in the wilderness, we would disconnect. Well, a couple of months ago when I found this problem I posted about it hoping to have it resolved, and several people had said that it was some sort of glitch with the packethandler (or something I don&#39;t remember it was months ago) and recently I have seen many re-released versions of Trisidia and I was wondering if this problem had been resolved, IF that even was the problem. Perhaps it could have been my VPS or coding error.. Any thoughts?</description>
