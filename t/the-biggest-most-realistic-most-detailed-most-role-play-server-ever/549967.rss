    <description>[b]The Vision[/b]
Imagine a server, where every click means something. Every step taken has a consequence. To live a story, your own story, as a being of many sorts, which simulates real-life (with a fantasy-medieval twist, of course). [i]One life[/i]. 

Forget about the traditional point, click and wait combat. Forget the skill and grind aspect we all know. Take the skin of a game that is familiar to us all, rip it&#39;s guts out and give it a new heart. This is what you get.

Once you log in you are born, figuratively speaking. Decide what you want to be  and the rest is up to you. Law-abiding citizen,  a crazy nomad wizard, dragon-slaying hero, or maybe a law-upholding kingsman? Go find some Vampires and live the cursed life (I know you secretly fantasise about it). The possibilities really are endless. 

Every action has a re-action. Murder, stealing, tax evasion and choosing to be rude in dialogue has its consequences. Even down to the small details like eating food and simply using coins will effect your character in some way. Everything is documented so you will know what you can do.

Choose your style of play, whether it be heroic, evil, a bit of both or something in between, you get to decide everything. But die, through being killed or, if you are boring, old age, and your account will literally remain dead. Your gravestone will be placed near your location and you may even go down in the history books. 

Still not convinced this is the game for you? That&#39;s fine, I know it won&#39;t be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, but let me give you some insight on a few misconceptions that might persuade you otherwise.

[b]Information[/b]

Development has begun. Currently collecting data.

[b]About/Credits[/b]
In the end, the poll as to what base to use was in favour of the old school Arios 498 project as opposed to the 718 loading 742. But then someone suggested to me to use a 317 framework and it made me think. After a day, I decided this would be my best option as I could write all the content from scratch and wouldn&#39;t have to worry about building off of an unfamiliar system or having to clean the source first. So I chose lare96&#39;s Asteria 2.0 project.

I am creating this server for no one else but myself, so when you ask why, why not? Collaborating ideas and collecting data as I go. Some days may even be purely preparation and not actual development in code. I also would love to discuss with you concepts, ways to implement systems and ways to make the entire game involving, interactive and immersive regarding a RuneScape-style world, so please strike up a conversation with me at any time. 

I have one rule. Talk to me as players (not developers). What do you like and dislike in games such as RuneScape, and all other simulation or RPG types.

I&#39;m not here to revolutionise RuneScape Private Servers. I want to change the idea completely.

<p>Thanks to everyone who voted. It was a hard decision, but an important one, and you all helped clarify to me what would best suit the server.

<p>you don’t need to do that, you can still use the appearance interface, just make a few amendments to the appearance packet. for example, certain colors and values are stored in arrays… so just return if they’re invalid.</p>
<p>to stop beards for example:</p>
<p><code>		if(data[1] &gt;= 1) {
		   player.getActionSender().sendMessage("You can't choose a beard!");
		   return;
		}
</code></p>
<p>or even certain values whilst being a female:</p>
<p><code>			if (i &lt; 7 &amp;&amp; !(data[i] &gt;= VALID_VALUES[i][0] &amp;&amp; data[i] &lt;= VALID_VALUES[i][1]) &amp;&amp; gender == 1) {
				player.getActionSender().sendMessage("You can't choose this appearance whilst being a female.");
				return;
                                }
</code></p>

That would be a fairly simple system in my eyes. Just store a number for each player and for every food considered good for you increment it for every food that is considered bad, decrement it. You wouldn’t be able to spam eat because you would become full and vomit.</p>

I don’t see the point in a time-defined high score if there’s a set limit to how long your character will survive. I could become a hermit and do nothing more dangerous than bake some bread and I’d become number one. You’re going to have to be more creative than that.<br>

<p>It’s good that you can problem solve, however making your solutions too complex won’t do you any favors. Plus it doesn’t seem very fair that one player can have better genes than the next and they don’t have any control over that. I’d steer clear of a system like that, it just adds unnecessary complexity. Diet is a good idea, however implementing that sounds like a small pain for what it’s worth.</p>

<p>Because brainstorming, discussing ways to implement the mechanics and taking the time to know what revision would best suit is part of the development.</p>
<p>Also, think of the highscores of PacMan. It shows who perservered and survived the longest. That is what this highscore will be about. There could also be highscores for most jobs had, most near death experiences, most food eaten. Just random fun things.</p>
<p>You’ve got to remember that if I took two years to do this it might not necessarily be worth it for you, but it would be worth it for me. It’s for my own satisfaction.</p>

              <p>Players would compete for a highscore to see who can live the longest. Also I don’t know if you think skilling would still mean standing at a bank fletching 5k yew logs into bows but it will be nothing like that. As I said  in my previous reply to you, grinding won’t really be an aspect.</p>
<p>Skilling will be based on experience rather than levels. Meaning theorectically you could fish sharks at level 1 but how many people do you know who have never been fishing before that could catch a shark? It’s all about the experience you have. You would nearly always fail. This is the basic overview of how “skilling” would work.</p>
<p>The difference is that you would be playing out a virtual life so unless you wanted a career in fishing, you would not be standing around for 10 hours catching lobsters. You would probably go out and catch your dinner and then move on to something else. The universal energy system will see that you cannot grind for hours and hours because you would be too exhausted. To balance this, it will be easy to “level” (need to find a use for levels) but if you leave something too long you become rusty and lose experience.</p>
<p>I stated in the first post that I am developing this purely for myself primarily. Of course, anyone who wants to play it, can. It will be designed to be playable whether there are 3 or 300 players online. The less players online, the more npcs will fill player’s roles. Then when more players come, they can take over the roles (shop keepers, guards etc.).</p>
<p>I do think a lot of people would say “I wouldn’t want to play this because if I die I would waste my time” because they can only imagine it through the way current RSPS works. I reckon in a couple of years once this hits Alpha stages I could change your mind.</p>

nobody’s gonna grind an rsps to that they can die at any time and not be able to play again<br>

This. I wouldn’t play a realistic server if I wanted to chill out one day. You need to realize these ideas will only seem fun to you, while others will admit it to be unique. Not worth playing though, because I wouldn’t want to play some sort of a storyline on a rsps that I just log in to chill out one day.</p>
<p>You’re missing the RuneScape aspect of this.[/quote]i wasnt even referring to that.</p>
<p>op states players can die randomly at any moment. and once dead its over.</p>
<p>people play hardcore because they know what to avoid and where to go to prevent death and losing all their hardwork.</p>
<p>i doubt anyone would grind out a server just to have their account doe of old age or sickness whilst skilling.</p>
<p>its “unique” sure. but all rather stupid.</p>
