    <title>Looking for decent team to work with!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-decent-team-to-work-with/539759</link>
    <description>[b]I&#39;m looking for a dedicated team of developers to help me program my server and client. I&#39;m looking for a long-term development team that can make this server into something amazing. I want to be able to learn and grow from the progress we make, and I want the server to have nice appeal, unique, and user friendly.

id like developers who can work well as a team

The developers must be mature and must not put down other members idea&#39;s.

who is needed at the moment:

someone with Intermediate Java experience with a server/client
[s]graphics design[/s] full
[s]web development[/s] full
someone who can do server sided stuff
someone who can do client sided stuff + cache



The most important thing that I want the developers to do is always debug new content, take your time when your programming, and think everything through.

BASE: overloadX client with a blank pi source

if you are not serious about working with us then do not bother posting or pming me and wasting my time, we hope to see you soon :)
