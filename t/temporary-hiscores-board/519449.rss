    <title>Temporary hiscores board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/temporary-hiscores-board/519449</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking into how to make a temporary highscores board that will reset each time the server restarts. This board will show people who have the most points currently in-game, players can be overtaken on points making it possible for people to jump ranks etc...

My problem is what&#39;s the most efficient way of doing something like this?

I was thinking of a list that holds the players, but I&#39;m not sure about the sorting in the order of points and then updating the list so that they&#39;re in the correct order.

Any help is appreciated.</description>

<p>Yeah, based on points, highest at the top, lowest at the bottom.</p>
<p>Every so often they will be re-checked and the list will be re-ordered. I’m not sure how to order them though.</p>

<p>The best way I could think of doing this, or ways I should say. Is to have a method sent when you shut the server off, or restart it. That method would update the MySQL tables and clear all the data.<br>
But most people restart the server by doing ::restart XTime and then just close it.<br>
So if anything you could have a function be added to the restart command, and it’d only execute when the time has hit zero.<br>
The following code is obviously not correct, but an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(playeCommand.startsWith("Restart")){
split args1 = substring 8; //Obviously not right.
fakeTimer = args1;
if(fakeTimer == 0){
shutdown();
resetHiscores();
}
}</code></pre>
<p>Then you’d need to write the resetHighscores function, but I’m too lazy to do that right now as I have nothing to base it off of.</p>
<p>Or you could use a php script on your website and witch checks to make sure that you’re obviously the owner, and have that reset the server. Again, this is manual, but it’d work just fine.</p>
<p>Another one you could do is go into phpmyadmin and manually drop all the players in the table.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not using MySQL for this as it’s only temporary and it’s only going to hold 10 players. I know how to reset it each time the server restarts, I just don’t know how to sort the players in the list so they’re in the right order.</p>
<p>It’s not for a hiscores, but I guess that would be the easiest way that people would understand what I’m trying to achieve.</p>
