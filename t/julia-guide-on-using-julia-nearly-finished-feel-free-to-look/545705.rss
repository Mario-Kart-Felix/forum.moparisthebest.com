[center][size=28pt][b]Guide on using Julia.[/b][/size][/center]
[center][size=12pt][b]Helping you on the way.[/b][/size]


[b]This guide is written for Julia, the &quot;server for beginners&quot; I released here:[/b] https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,664587.0.html[/center]



[size=16pt][b]Server sided:[/b][/size]

[size=12pt][b]Server Properties:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
The server properties are the most important things that identify your server.
You can find and edit them by clicking on properties:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/Ec2hLYV.png[/img]

The properties screen will pop up and here you can make the server truly yours:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/dJqVaCe.png[/img]

I think this is pretty clear how to use it, if it isn&#39;t reply on this thread and I will expand this section.
One thing I want to notice is that resetting defaults will reset to the properties of Julia, like they were when
you first downloaded the server. This is in case you fudgeed up everything and want to restart from zero.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Changing starter:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
The starter is the items a player starts with when he logs in for the first time.
You can access the editor via here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/rpWeR88.png[/img]

This is how it looks like:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/kOO3AaF.png[/img]

As you can see, a list shows you the currently set starter items.
You can remove them or add new ones by providing an item id (see links at bottom of the guide)
and an amount of the item.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Managing players:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
You can find the player manager via here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/uPWDJel.png[/img]

This is how the manager looks like:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/pjzi6qQ.png[/img]

The list will give you all the players registered, so also the one&#39;s that are NOT online at the moment.
You can edit their rights or punish them for bad behavior.

To interact with a player&#39;s account you have to [b]select[/b] it from the list.
The current details will automatically be displayed and from there on you can edit the player.
Once done editing, hit [b]update[/b].

[b]Reload:[/b] Pressing the reload button will refresh the players list and the online players count.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Using extern commands:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
The commands panel allows you to execute commands as server manager.
You do not have to be logged in to use this as you operate as server manager and not as a player.
To go to the commands panel navigate here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/OF5A7Iu.png[/img]

The panel shows you what commands are available, how to use them and even an example on using them,
so this shouldn&#39;t be to hard.
You [b]don&#39;t[/b] need to put &#39;::&#39; before the command as we&#39;re not in game here.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/MaGGZyA.png[/img]

Hitting the [b]execute[/b] button will execute your command.
The [b]last command [/b]button will refill the last command you executed in case you want to spam a command.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Editing npc drops:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
This editor allows you to add/remove and edit drops for an npc.
Navigate to the editor via here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/fXVYJIp.png[/img]

When start entering an id in the &#39;npc id&#39; field, don&#39;t panic.
The list automatically loads the drops it knows the for the npc with that id.
Just enter the complete id of your npc and then start editing what you want.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/2e9hxFS.png[/img]

You simply enter an item id, the amount and the drop rarity to add a drop for an npc.
If you [b]select[/b] a drop from the list you can also edit the drop.

The [b]clear button[/b] will clear the screen from all the input to start fresh. It wil [b]NOT[/b] remove your drops.
The [b]add drop button[/b] will add a new drop for the npc with the details you provided.
The [b]remove drop button[/b] will remove the drop you have [b]selected[/b] from the list.
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Editing npc definitions:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
Editing npc definitions is not something you do a lot, but if think your npc should be stronger or weaker
or you want to add a bunch of health, then you need to navigate to the editor via here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/cqz2y9L.png[/img]

[b]Important![/b] Don&#39;t just add a definition, there is still a bug in this version that doesn&#39;t check
if there&#39;s already a definition for the npc. 

First search for the npc id, enter the npc id in the field above the [b]find button[/b] and hit [b]find[/b].
If there is a definition for the npc it will load all the details and you can start editing!
If there is none it will tell you and you can safely add a new definition for that npc.

To edit simply change the details to your liking and hit the [b]edit button[/b].

[img]http://i.imgur.com/2yedna8.png[/img]
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Editing npc spawns:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
This is something you will probably pass by a lot!
This editor allows you to add new npc&#39;s in your game and remove them.
Navigate to the editor via here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/8KfW5CL.png[/img]

When you click on [b]show all spawns[/b] you will see a list with all the existing spawns.
To remove a spawn you need to write the exact data in the text fields and hit the[b] remove spawn button.[/b]
[i]!!!I will make this easier in the next version!!![/i]

To add a new spawn you provide the id of the npc as well as the coordinates where
you want it to spawn. (z stands for height)
You can also indicate via the [b]moves checkbox[/b] if you want the npc to walk around.
Once you entered all the details you hit the [b]add spawn button[/b].
[img]http://i.imgur.com/rDKcoCy.png[/img]
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Editing item definitions:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
Editing item definitions is something you wont touch that much BUT
can be extremely useful sometimes.

It allows you to edit the rights for an item (e.g. make it members-only).
And sometimes you pass by an item and see it should be stacked when it&#39;s not,
or it&#39;s in the wrong equipment slot. Or maybe the bonuses are wrong!
Or maybe you want to make an admin item with insane bonuses!

You can edit it very easily with this editor!
Navigate to it via here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/0FWBynD.png[/img]

[b]!!!Important: Just like with npc definitions this version has a bug that doesn&#39;t check
if the there is already a definition for the item.!!![/b]

^So if you want to edit an item, FIRST try finding the item by entering the item id in the search field
and hit the [b]find button[/b].
If there is a definition for the item it will load the details and you can start editing.
If there is none you can go ahead and add a definition yourself.

Once you edited all the details to your likings, hit [b]edit definition[/b].
If you fudgeed some shit up or want to start fresh, hit reset to clear the screen,
this will NOT remove your definitions.

Here&#39;s how the editing of a definitions goes in it&#39;s work.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/FTBil4s.png[/img]
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Editing item prizes:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]
Editing prizes of items makes the economy how you want it.
Navigate to the editor via here:
[img]http://i.imgur.com/iAZx7ds.png[/img]

[b]!!!note: Ignore the currency box, leave it at coins. This has to be reworked in the next version.!!![/b]

When entering an item id, the current price for the item will be automatically shown.
To edit the price simply enter a new price and hit confirm.
[img]http://i.imgur.com/8zqU0Mn.png[/img]

[i]Ignore the 2 &#39;note&#39; words at the bottom, will be gone in the next version.[/i]
[/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Editing shops:[/b][/size]
[spoiler]This is not available in the latest released version yet. Stay tuned for the next version.[/spoiler]




[size=16pt][b]Client sided:[/b][/size]

[size=12pt][b]Client properties:[/b][/size]
[spoiler][/spoiler]

[size=12pt][b]Client background[/b][/size]
[spoiler][/spoiler]



[b]Useful links:[/b]
This link can provide you item codes by searching for an item name: http://itemdb.biz
Some id&#39;s wont be working for the server as they are custom edited or from another revision.
All the ones from revision 317 should work though.

This link will provide you codes for multiple stuff like item&#39;s, npc&#39;s, objects and more: http://rspscodes.synthasite.com/
This is only for revision 317.

In the next Julia version you will be able to search items/npc&#39;s and other id&#39;s via the control panel search function.</description>
