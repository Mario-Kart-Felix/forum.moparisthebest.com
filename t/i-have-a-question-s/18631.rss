    <description>I made some changes in hybrid scape such as add spawns and stuff. i compile it but it does not work.
my question is can you add item spawns &amp; or npc spawn from scratch or do you need to use the ones that are already there also when you continue with compiling can you use the internet version of moparscape instead of the one you install? Also can you edit the levels of certain npc without it messing up? I need an answer ASAP</description>

              <p>Im kindof a noob, lol, but i know the answer to one of those I think, For the internet version of moparscape, I pretty sure that if you have it saved on your own sever then you get on the online version and type in that sever and port and stuff, then I think that the stuff you where workin on will still be there and you should still be able to add new stuff to it, but Im not 100% sure, maybe a more experianced person will help you soon. Good Luck tho.</p>
