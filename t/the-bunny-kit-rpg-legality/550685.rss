    <title>&#39;The Bunny Kit&#39; RPG legality?</title>

Some time ago, I made a small multiplayer browser-based game using sprites from &#39;The bunny kit&#39; which was released a few years ago. I had built basic combat, chat, equipping of items and armour and a basic inventory system. Didn&#39;t name it or anything, it was mainly an experiment.

Are the creator(s) of the Bunny Kit still around? Would using it inside my game infringe on somebodies IP or copyright? Would I require permission to use this in my game? I highly doubt RuneScape would be able to claim copyright infringement if I had created something so fundamentally different to their game.</description>

<p>I’m quite capable. I would be saving time to focus on the other problems of browser based MMOs.</p>
<p>Thanks for the replies. As I said it was mainly an experiment, I just don’t want to step on anybodies toes, no matter how small or big the game would be. The fact the kit is used throughout (hundreds) of forums, and in some cases sold, leads me to believe it’s not legally bound by any copyright.</p>

<p>Makes good quick artwork for a 2d RPG because of the huge selection of items available. I’m surprised nobody has done this before to be honest.[/quote]<br>
Lack of usage terms would imply that you’re not allowed to use it. A simple copyright mark is all that is necessary and you find that on some of the released material.</p>
