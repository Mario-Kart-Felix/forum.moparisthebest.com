              <p>There are many Bases which feature this. They are almost all below the 562 Revision however. This involves Pathfinding, even though it can be done by retrieving the N.P.C. original X/Y Tile Coordinates. Which are already stored in your Source without a doubt. You could enable the N.P.C. return once It’s out of Combat. I’m sure your Source already has this as a preexisting condition as well.</p>
<p>As for the maximum N.P.C. Attack range? You can do a Distance check in It’s formulas or however you have it programmed. I seriously doubt this has advanced statistical storage; otherwise you could implement this as a statistic and that is SOOO much better.</p>
