    <description>I have this problem with my delta based server, it isn&#39;t exaclty delta but is based from it. Ok well from time to time your character will just drop dead and it will say you defeated yourself. For example &quot;You have defeated Owner Cheese&lt;---- my name&quot;. It might be the death timers but im not sure. It pretty much happens all the time when someone first starts off as well. Is it possible I can fix this? If so please dont say things like &quot;D3LT@ 5UK5 Y0U N00B!!1!!PIE&quot;. I get a lot of things like that here and its very dissapointing and will need to no help, I just want a soloution or how to fix the problem. I can code a bit so if I have to change things thats ok with me.</description>
