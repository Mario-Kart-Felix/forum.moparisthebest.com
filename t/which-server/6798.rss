<p>Maby you should try getting a server and adding that stuff… You cant just download a server and say its good you have to fix it up</p>

</aside>
<p>ok lemme just make something clear, I’ve only found 1 server with character appearance customization, and there wasnt any npc’s this source was weird, it didnt have any cfg files so i donno how to edit it.</p>
<p>most people dont know how to add character customization apparently. I am one of those people that doesnt know how.</p>
<p>so i would like to download a source with character customization and an npc.cfg file to edit. hopefully that clears things up a bit.[br][size=1]Posted at: July 29, 2006, 06:06:43 PM[/size][hr]help would be appreciated</p>
