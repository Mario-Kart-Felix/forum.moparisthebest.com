    <description>Excuse me for being noobish (my server&#39;s been up only 1 day) and I think I&#39;ve progressed and learnt quite a bit so far from the tutorials posted on this site..

1. What file do I need to edit to change shop-prices?
2. [REQ] This is totally my idea, but is it possible for someone to create a code that on server start spawns a wall to close the entry to the palace (2 places both consisting of 2x1)
1st place: 3224,3465 | 3224,3466 
2nd place: 3213,3458 | 3212,3458

And then when an admin types ::open the walls dissapear and ::close they close again?

If not possible then maybe a teleport command into the castle (I can do this myself im pretty sure)
My main concern is how to spawn objects the tutorials aren&#39;t very clear.. If I knew how to spawn objects/remove them I&#39;d code it myself. 
EDIT: Running on testscape source.</description>
