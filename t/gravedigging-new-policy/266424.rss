    <description>A member has asked me to address this as an announcement, and so I will. It is no secret that there are many members on this forum that are posting in old topics. This is [b]not[/b] against the rules. But, in most cases, these users are spamming the topic just to bump it, and that [i]is[/i] against the rules. Anyone who does not legitimately gravedig a topic will henceforth be warned or moderated immediately. This is a harsh decision, but it is necessary to stop this gravedigging epidemic that is spreading the forum.</description>
