    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-revision-is-this/472044</link>
    <description>Hey, Could anyone tell me what revision these character models are?

The reason being as the heads looks nice and I just seem to like it more than the ones I have currently which are 634 and the heads are ugly. And if you could please tell me how I could downgrade the models to this one. And if anyone has the models could you please link me to them?

Thanks, RS PS
