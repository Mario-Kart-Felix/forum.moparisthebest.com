    <description>i need to code this can anyone help me or teach me if possible? please reply with any way i can contact you , thanks.
Write a Java Class called  FindPrimes that computes and find the number of Prime numbers between 2 and an upper bound limit set by the user. The Class should comprise the following:
1.	An instance variable, limit, of type static and int to represent the upper bound limit.
2.	A non-parameterized constructor that sets limit to zero.
3.	A parameterized constructor that takes one integer parameter and sets limit to the value of the parameter. Before doing that it checks whether or not the value of the parameter is negative. If it is, the constructor ends the program.
4.	One mutator  and one accessor method to set and get the value of the instance variable.
5.	A main() method where a Scanner object and a FindPrimes object are created. Then, the program finds the prime numbers between 2 and the value of the instance variable limit. To do this main() uses a method IsPrime() that checks whether or not a number is prime. 
6.	The method IsPrime() takes an int argument (the number to be checked) and returns true if the number is prime and  false if not. 
7.	A prime number is a number that divides by 1 and by itself only. (Hint: for a given number r, divide r by 2, then by 3, ..., until square root of r (inclusive), and check the remainder. if the remainder is zero 0 for any number between 2 and square root of r, then r is NOT prime). 
8.	After computing the number of primes between 2 and limit, main() will display a ratio of the number of primes by the total of the number between 1 and limit. Example: between 1 and 30 the program should find 10 primes. The ratio of primes is 
	(100) * 10/30  which 33.33 %</description>

<p>My mistake. I don’t usually make static setters often so it’s a little habit using this.</p>

<p>Point 4 sounds like it want him to return a single instance of the class and have it work as a singleton, but then again the static variable doesn’t make sense. But what can we expect, it seems like the instructor or whoever gave him this assignment is trolling him.

No construct in Java can be both an instance-variable and a static variable, for instance.</p>

Want to learn to program? Learn to problem solve.<br>
I’m not sure if this is homework or self-study. Either way, homework generally isn’t assigned without accompanying resources. If it’s self-study from a book, the resources required to complete these activities are provided within the pages before these. If it’s from a website, Google each part.<br>
We do not complete homework for you. We do not write code for you. We at least expect you to attempt the problem and then ask us specific questions, showing your attempt at the same time.</p>
<p>The different parts can almost be seen as instructions. Go through each one and eventually you will have completed the end goal. If you need extra help:<br>
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html</a></p>
<p>Other than that, don’t post again until you have at least made an effort and tried to solve the problem yourself.</p>
<p>I know this comes off as harsh but I’m telling you this for your own good.<br>
Good luck.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not harsh at all, why should we help do your work?</p>

Write a Java Class called  FindPrimes that computes and find the number of Prime numbers between 2 and an upper bound limit set by the user. The Class should comprise the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>An instance variable, limit, of type static and int to represent the upper bound limit.</li>
<li>A non-parameterized constructor that sets limit to zero.</li>
<li>A parameterized constructor that takes one integer parameter and sets limit to the value of the parameter. Before doing that it checks whether or not the value of the parameter is negative. If it is, the constructor ends the program.</li>
<li>One mutator  and one accessor method to set and get the value of the instance variable.</li>
<li>A main() method where a Scanner object and a FindPrimes object are created. Then, the program finds the prime numbers between 2 and the value of the instance variable limit. To do this main() uses a method IsPrime() that checks whether or not a number is prime.</li>
<li>The method IsPrime() takes an int argument (the number to be checked) and returns true if the number is prime and  false if not.</li>
<li>A prime number is a number that divides by 1 and by itself only. (Hint: for a given number r, divide r by 2, then by 3, …, until square root of r (inclusive), and check the remainder. if the remainder is zero 0 for any number between 2 and square root of r, then r is NOT prime).</li>
<li>After computing the number of primes between 2 and limit, main() will display a ratio of the number of primes by the total of the number between 1 and limit. Example: between 1 and 30 the program should find 10 primes. The ratio of primes is<br>
(100) * 10/30  which 33.33 %</li>
</ol>
