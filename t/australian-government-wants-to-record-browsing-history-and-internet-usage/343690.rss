    <title>Australian government wants to record browsing history and internet usage</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Companies who provide customers with a connection to the internet may soon have to retain subscriber&#39;s private web browsing history for law enforcement to examine when requested, a move which has been widely criticised by industry insiders.

The Attorney-General&#39;s Department yesterday confirmed to ZDNet Australia that it had been in discussions with industry on implementing a data retention regime in Australia. Such a regime would require companies providing internet access to log and retain customer&#39;s private web browsing history for a certain period of time for law enforcement to access when needed.

Currently, companies that provide customers with a connection to the internet don&#39;t retain or log subscriber&#39;s private web browsing history unless they are given an interception warrant by law enforcement, usually approved by a judge. It is only then that companies can legally begin tapping a customer&#39;s internet connection.

In March 2006, the European Union formally adopted its data retention directive (PDF), a directive which the Australian Government said it wished to use as an example if it implemented such a regime.

&quot;The Attorney-General&#39;s Department has been looking at the European Directive on Data Retention, to consider whether such a regime is appropriate within Australia&#39;s law enforcement and security context,&quot; a statement from the Attorney-General&#39;s Department to ZDNet Australia said yesterday. &quot;It has consulted broadly with the telecommunications industry.&quot;

The EU regime requires that the communications providers from certain EU member states retain necessary data as specified in the Directive for a period of between six and 24 months.

One internet service provider (ISP) source told ZDNet Australia that the Australian regime, if implemented, could go as far as recording each URL a customer visited and all emails.

That source said such a regime &quot;would be scary and very expensive&quot;.

Another industry source said Australians should &quot;be very f***ing afraid&quot;.

They said the regime being considered by the Australian Government could see data held for much longer than EU Directive time of 24 months — it would be more like five or ten years.

&quot;They seem quite intent [on implementing the regime] and they keep throwing up the words &#39;terrorism&#39; and &#39;paedophiles&#39;,&quot; the source said. &quot;We&#39;re talking browsing history and emails, way beyond what I would consider to be normal SMS, retaining full browsing history and everything.&quot;

Internet Industry Association (IIA) chief executive officer (CEO) Peter Coroneos also confirmed that the industry was having discussions with the Attorney-General&#39;s Department.

&quot;There has been some preliminary discussions with the Attorney-General&#39;s Department about a proposal for a data retention regime in Australia, but I think those discussions are at a very early stage,&quot; Coroneos said. He said the IIA hadn&#39;t &quot;seen any firm proposals yet from the government&quot;.

&quot;It&#39;s more along the lines of [the Attorney-General&#39;s Department asking] &#39;What do you see the issues of being if we were to move to a position similar to the EU&#39;,&quot; he said.

&quot;But as I say, there wouldn&#39;t be any intention, I wouldn&#39;t think, to move to any policy position on this unless there was a full public debate about the proposal.&quot;

If the idea were to move to a more &quot;serious proposal&quot;, Coroneos said the IIA&#39;s view would be &quot;to engage not only with the industry but also the community in a proper discussion&quot;.

Electronic Frontier Australia (EFA) chair Colin Jacobs said the regime was &quot;a step too far&quot;.

&quot;At some point data retention laws can be reasonable, but highly-personal information such as browsing history is a step too far,&quot; Jacobs said. &quot;You can&#39;t treat everybody like a criminal. That would be like tapping people&#39;s phones before they are suspected of doing any crime.&quot;

He added that browser history could reveal all sorts of personal information. &quot;And furthermore, the way the internet works, it&#39;s a huge amount of data to be kept and it requires some snooping on the part of the ISPs into which [web] pages people are looking at.&quot;

In February, the senate passed a Bill allowing ISPs to intercept traffic as part of &quot;network protection activities&quot;. According to an ISP source, it&#39;s likely another Bill would be required for a data retention regime to be implemented.

&quot;It is likely that new legislation will be required to put any [data retention] obligations in place,&quot; the source said. &quot;It seems to be early days yet, and we have an election looming, which means there will be some time required to get any new law in place.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So now we have a Chinese-like internet filter AND collection of private data (browsing history, potentially email and so on as well) being brought into existence by the Labor government.
For any Australian voters here (there&#39;s at least a handful of us), vote below the line and give Conroy/KRudd/etc last preference.

Also, according to government figures, Australians don&#39;t need a bill of rights. What a crock of shit that is.</description>

<p>If it’s encrypted (which I’m sure all of it is) then the only way to block it would be to block all encrypted traffic (https too), or to decrypt and analyze it, which no machine is powerful enough to do in realtime.</p>
<p>So theoretically you could block it if you had a big enough computer, but practically, no, they can’t block VPN traffic.</p>

Ok, to put what’s going to happen into perspective.<br>
Our filtering scheme is going to block the following: Euthanasia; crime, which could include things such as graffiti art; anti-abortion websites; other material that isn’t necessarily illegal to own or view, but isn’t allowed to be sold or publicly viewed in Australia.[/quote]</p>
<p>So who decides what gets blocked?  Because some of it would be good to block (child porn, maybe some crime stuff), but the other seems to be valid free speech, like euthanasia and anti-abortion sites.  Both of those latter two are valid views to have.</p>

<p>Porn that features women with small breasts is going to be censored, because Australians can’t tell the difference between a 28 year old with small breasts and a 13 year old apparently.</p>

</aside>
<p>Did your government explicitly say that they are going to ban that? That’s discrimination! They see small breasts as an indicator of immaturity? I don’t know the Australian constitution, but the Dutch constitution clearly states that discrimination on any grounds shall not be permitted!</p>
<p>I’m actually quite serious, not because I care about the Australian porn industry, but because citizens should have freedom, and the internet is the heaven of freedom. For instance, Lothy said that a website about euthanasia will be illegal. How does that comply with freedom of thought and speech? I am free to think, and I am free to express my thoughts.</p>

Ok, to put what’s going to happen into perspective.<br>
Our filtering scheme is going to block the following: Euthanasia; crime, which could include things such as graffiti art; anti-abortion websites; other material that isn’t necessarily illegal to own or view, but isn’t allowed to be sold or publicly viewed in Australia.</p>

<p>The only conclusion that can be drawn is that it won’t work, or at least not effectively. Old mate down the road who doesn’t want to shell out for a VPN service will suffer, but the criminals will simply bypass it.</p>

It’s pornography, skype (So that people make international calls using the telecom company) and other things. Filtering is very sophisticated and strict. Over here many people use VPNs and http proxy’s (which are now useless unless they’re through SSL). So if by any chance Australia’s internet gets filtered to this extent, investing in a VPN or even a simple web based proxy would be a good idea.</p>

<p>Haha, fuck that. I’ll pay for a VPN service or something if the worst case scenario comes into fruition.</p>

<p>Hell, as long as I’m running a dedicated server I’ll set up a VPN server for you if it comes to it.</p>

<p>It’s actually a great business opportunity. If Australia ends up censoring the internet, a lot of people are going to be looking for ways to bypass this. Buy www.unblockwebsites.com.au and teach them how to use your vpn. You can charge a monthly fee or even just use ads.<br>

<p>Australia would obviously just block that website, and any others that show people how to get around filters.  That is what all the other filtering countries do right?[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s what they’ve done here. But all it takes is for a few people to learn how to bypass and then it’ll spread like a disease.</p>
<p>Over here for example, many people use Hotspot shield (Vpn software) to bypass the filter. It’s website is now blocked. It’s still available through mirror websites like <a href="http://www.download.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.download.com</a>.</p>
