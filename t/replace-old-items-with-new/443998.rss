    <title>Replace old items with new?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/replace-old-items-with-new/443998</link>
    <description>For some odd reason my server has an item limit so i&#39;m just wondering how i would replace old items with new ones. e.g

i added a new item
(steadfast boots)

itemDef.java:

[code]
				case 19917:
			itemDef.modelid = 53835;
			itemDef.name = &quot;Steadfast boots&quot;;
			itemDef.description = &quot;A pair of powerful-looking boots.&quot;;
			itemDef.modelZoom = 900;
			itemDef.modelRotationY = 165;
			itemDef.modelRotationX = 99;
			itemDef.modelOffset1 = 3;
			itemDef.modelOffset2 = -7;
			itemDef.value = 20000;
			itemDef.anInt165 = 53327;
			itemDef.anInt200 = 53643;
			itemDef.groundActions = new String[5];
			itemDef.groundActions[2] = &quot;Take&quot;;
			itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
			itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Equip&quot;;
			break;[/code]
then item.cfg

[code]
item = 19917	Samaden_seed	Plant_in_a_vine_herb_patch.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0[/code]
i replace that with this

[code]
item = 19917	Steadfast_boots	Boots.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0[/code]
yet when i bank them the old item shows and when i have them in my invent there is a 1 in the corner (to show they used to be stack-able)

anyway to fix this as i would like to add customs lol
or would the best way be to find something like boots that people don&#39;t use.

any input appreciated thanks</description>
