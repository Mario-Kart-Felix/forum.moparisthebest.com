    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-server-error/171481</link>
    <description>Right now this is pissing me off heres the problem every client I use when type in username, pass and put server up it says error connectiong to server... and says nothing in server log, I&#39;ve used lot&#39;s of clients like Silabsoft, Mopar, My Own, CSK, And much more
but as always them same ERROR CONNECTING TO SERVER 

NOTE:I used diffrent servers too  and there the same ports and i have tried to put in 127.0.0.1

Yet again i have deleted my caches and downloaded them again but still no connection.


And i have turned firewall off....
