    <description>Fucking legend game, get on this if you got a PS3 tis good. Anyone else got it and waht do you think of it? I love the create controls for tracks, its easy to make a quick professional looking track and the create options for mods and karts is fantastic, i recommend this for PS3.

my only issue is the slightly long load times for races can be a bit too much sometimes but its always worth it</description>
