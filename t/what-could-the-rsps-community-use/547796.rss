    <title>What could the RSPS community use?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-could-the-rsps-community-use/547796</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got some free time and nothing to do. So... Is there anything web-related that you guys think the RSPS community could use? If it involves integration with the server, I can try to pull it off, but no promises. I had the idea of a price guide/checker that is user submitted, but that&#39;s basic and no fun. Any ideas would be cool. Thanks!</description>

Thanks for the idea <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I might try to incorporate that into my project.<br>
Not so much the in-game but good job thinking outside the box <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>I took a template and am integrating it with smf atm , I’m having a difficult time with the design aspect if you wanna help :3</p>
<p>Im not affiliated with the name of the rsps or any rsps that is being shown in this picture, in fact I think the one being advertised is no longer up.</p>
<p>I also have some functionality that I’m adding to the home page you can help with if you’d like since I think you’re more of a programmer rather than a designer.</p>
