    <description>I keep finding these poems from five years ago out of nowhere. :|

Anyways, please read and comment.

[center][u]Ode To Hatred[/u]
I sense you all around me,
Everywhere I go.
I try to avoid your toxin,
But you appear spontaneously.
You enter through any opening,
In order to consume my heart.
I attempt to deviate from your grasp,
But you seem to hold on.
I feel as if you’re trying to capture me,
Then bring about my addiction towards you.
Although I do not want this addiction,
I cannot control myself; I am powerless.
Spreading slowly, without interruption, through the world,
More toxic than any known poison,
You enter each and every individual’s heart,
Devouring their soul,
Leaving nothing other than hatred,
In their now-empty heart.
Why do you attempt to take over us,
Succeeding with every attempt you make?
Why can’t we suppress this emotion,
Even with all our potential?
You are a demon,
Waiting hungrily to feast on spirits and souls.[/center]</description>
