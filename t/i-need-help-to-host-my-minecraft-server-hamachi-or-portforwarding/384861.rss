    <title>I need help to host my minecraft Server [Hamachi or Portforwarding]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-to-host-my-minecraft-server-hamachi-or-portforwarding/384861</link>
    <description>Hello, I try a few times to host my server. I watch a lot of video. But all this video suck because they wont give any proof of if it work or not. And i&#39;m very tired of that type of video.

If someone can help or at least give a video who really work. I will be verry Happy.

Thank you.

<p>I know how portforward. I add the port to my router and I check it on a port checker and it say it open.<br>
After I create a No-ip and I add it to the server.property  and i ask my friend to try to join it and it wont work.</p>
<p>Any one have an Idea of why it not working ?</p>
