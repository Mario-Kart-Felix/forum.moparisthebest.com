    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-dose-any1-know-if-you-can-make-a-perm-clan-chat/404116</link>
    <description>hello ive looked thought the first 30 pages of server help ect even toturls and i can&#39;t find  any help with this.
 all im asking is for some help on making a perm clan chat so the clan chat stays there, insted of kicking everyone esle out just becos the host of the clan chat has left or logged out. 

please any help would be helpfull, also could you either post an applet or a link on how to make one.


i dont need a clan chat applet, i have working clan chat just i need to know how to make a perm clan chat.</description>

              <p>I would guess to make it save when they logout which clan chat they are in.  don’t know how to do this though ;x</p>

<p><code>		if (clans[clanId] != null) {
