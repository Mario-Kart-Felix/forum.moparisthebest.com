    <title>My computer is fuked --&gt; win xp installation trouble</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-computer-is-fuked-win-xp-installation-trouble/229372</link>
    <description>OK the story begins with this:
From like a few days ago whenever I shut down my computer or click the restart icon, after showing the logon screen just before it shuts down, this blue blackground comes and the error at the top says -

STOP: c00021a {Fatal System Error}
The Windows Logon Process System process terminated unexpectedly with a status
of 0x00000000 (0x00000000 0x00000000)
The system has been shut down

Now I researched this on the internet, forgot what the cause was and I read comments saying that they fixed it by repairing their PC with the windows xp CD. OK I put the CD in, booted the computer from the CD and chose the Repair option. OK the usual comes up with the blue installation screen where it gives you all the ads about the features of XP on the right hand side and the approximate minutes to completion on the left. The process goes on and it asks for CD key and stuff. I put that in and it keeps going until it says that there are approximately 9 minutes of installation left. I waited but that 9 minutes still doesn&#39;t change and nothing happens except for the continuous ads that appear one after the next! I kept on waiting for over half an hour but nothing changes! OK so it was at night time that day and I would have gotten snapped if I left the computer on by my parents. I have no choice but to press the main button on the computer to shut it down the old style..
OK next day I tried it again. Same thing. OK Now whenever I restart or start the computer, after the bootscreen it just goes back to that xp installation screen again.. I have no way to exit that installation screen anymore except to go through it but I can&#39;t since it&#39;s always stuck at 9 minutes!! I can&#39;t even go on safe mode, tried taking the CD out but that xp installation screen is unavoidable now.
If I don&#39;t think of something I&#39;m FUCKED. So if anyone has used the xp CD before and has had this issue or if you know any way around this and fix that random error I mentioned way back at the top please say so!
Thanks</description>

Just backup all your important files and reformat your hard drive. Then install a fresh copy of xp.</p>

<p>You’re doing it wrong.</p>
<p>To give you an idea, formatting a harddrive wipes everything from it, you have to install windows again before you can use it as a primary harddrive. If you get any errors after doing this, and it isn’t software related(I.E., corrupt windows install), then it’s hardware related(probably memory related).</p>

              <p>EDIT: OK I got it working</p>
<p>OK now I finished the installation. Had to keep rebooting for some things to work. OK now I can log on but that blue error still comes up at every shut down! And everything is lagging badly + when I go to windows explorer the names of the directories are different with weird symbols. Please help me, and I can’t system restore aswell because when it restarts, the blue screen just appears and it will say that there has been an error during the system restore…</p>
