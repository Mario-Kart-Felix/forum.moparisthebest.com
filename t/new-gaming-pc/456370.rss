    <title>New Gaming PC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-gaming-pc/456370</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been wanting a gaming PC for about 4 years now; I finally have a job, so I would like to start saving money every paycheck, which will eventually add up for a gaming PC. I&#39;ve been looking at several and I&#39;m willing to go up to $800 for one. I&#39;ve found one that I personally like:
http://www.ibuypower.com/Store/Ship_Out_Next_Business_Day_AMD_FX_4-Core

Does this seem like a good computer to game on? (With this I&#39;d like to play games on decent quality without lag whilst also being able to record the game-play with FRAPS)</description>

              <p>After reading this entire thread no one has gotten to help the op here in his/her question on acquiring a 800$ limit Gaming Computer. Who cares if its building, or assembling the computer its all the same to starting people i should know <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> no college training and i still love putting one together. New egg, or Tigerdirect will offer great deals on preassembled computers, and also on parts for building/assembling your own, or just for upgrades. A lot of the other poster do have valid points if you can put a square block in a square hole then go for assembling/building your own just make sure to look if the motherboard will support something example (ddr ram will not work with ddr3). If you don’t quite feel comfortable with taking on this task look on YouTube or forums. There’s a lot of info on doing this on Google its quite easy I assembled/built 3 comps so far working on another as im typing this. Don’t get frustrated with looking at parts and thinking if i get all this and i cant put this together then i have failed im sure there’s a place in your town that will assemble/build it for you at a cost.</p>
<p>and if you really want a flame war amds are crap :D. 01 pen4 3.0 4g ddr with 9400gt nvid (my first comp i built/assembled) had 2 friends bring me there amd with over heating and bug problems was able to get them fixed. Mind you the comps they built/assembled where x2-x3 better then my own and they had 2-3 more buildings/assembling of different computer one had even went to college for computer tech. Amds will be cheap and going on a budget there ideal i just don’t like them my pen4 is still going today no problems but my hdds had 3 with clicks of deaths. Google will be your newest buddy if your looking to build/assemble your first computer took me 4 days to get that pen4 going but hey i did it and &lt;3ed it</p>

<p>The piece of shit I’m using right now I, “built”, or whatever terminology you want us to use in your thread. It’s running a AMD Phenom II X4. Possibly the nicest part on it… I have a six-core sitting on my desk, because the MOBO I was going to install as an upgrade cracked when I lifted up the gate to put the CPU in… Just one of the hard ships of putting a computer together on you’re own.</p>

<p>a pc repair technician will never be called a computer engineer… also, no one in their right mind with a comp. eng. degree would work for 7-15/hr</p>

              <p>[quote=“Loveandpower, post:1, topic:456703”]Not necessarily 100% true either t4. Any job depends on locations, population, job duties, and etc.</p>
<p>A lot of times a company will also title a position one thing, but have it have the duties of something lower. This way, they get a more qualified member at alower pay-rate generally speaking.</p>
<p>For example: Different system administrator levels/Sys Admin “leads” instead of “director” even though they actually have the same duties.[/quote]<br>
what does that have to do with this situation? there’s a HUGE difference between the two types of jobs… you have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>edit: to put it into perspective, you’re basically calling a mechanical engineer and a mechanic the same job.</p>

anyone who is a computer engineer would be greatly offended at your definition. a computer engineer works designing hardware: CPUs and the like; they also can write drivers. they don’t assemble computers rofl.</p>
<p>entry level IT people build machines. they get paid at most 30k/yr. computer engineers out of university can score 80-120k easily.</p>

<p>I had no knowledge on how to build a PC but knew I wanted to do it because it’s honestly a fun task and is somewhat of an accomplishment knowing you built it. With advice from a few people from reddit and irc I was able to build a great set up for a lot loss than buying it prebuilt.</p>

              <p>The hardest part about building a computer is getting a case with proper cooling and power supply stuff (from experience anyway). It’s very hard to buy incompatible parts if you’re looking for high-end parts. Newegg will show all the specs of the hardware you’re buying so you really don’t have to worry about risks or not knowing something about the parts.</p>
