    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-fix-my-player-folder-check-this-out/547130</link>
    <description>Im so sorry for being dumb but this is my first rsps. The character folder that i made works, it saves the data but its just a jumble of really weird text. Ill send a screenshot it looks like its encrypted or something btw the player folder does work like it saves the data for the account but I want to know how I can make myself owner with it. Heres a screenshot http://gyazo.com/f71208753d3a7eaa206e76e8b96484cf</description>

The characters are saved in a .dat format more than likely. Typically, you can’t read .dat files with text editors, as they come up with a bunch of weird shapes. But some data may be readable…</p>
<p>If you want to make it readable, you’re going to have to change the save format from a .dat to a .txt, which will require you to change most of the saving system.</p>

<p>Since when do people save player data in dat formats?</p>
<p>What your looking at is a form of binary saving. This basically encrypts the data into a ‘.bin’ file (unless you are using 718+ which people normally program Seriazable saving, which in some cases is much more efficient. There is no way you can edit the credentials in the encrypted file for security reasons, hence why the developers program Binary or Seriazable saving methods. So to make your self owner, you have to go to the method that loads the encrypted file (normally found in the player class) and add (if you have this method)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (getUsername().equalsIgnoreCase("Your name")) {
player.setRights(2);
}</code></pre>
<p>If you have any other questions feel free to ask.[/quote]<br>
Since when? I’ve seen plenty of servers…<br>
I’d think they got the idea from how the cache is saved and etc. I haven’t seen any ‘.bin’ file used for player saves, ever. In the 700+ servers, they used .p files. Or that I’ve seen, it easily could have changed.<br>
I didn’t really look into the 500-600 servers, but I believe they used xml.<br>
317-377/474 people typically used .txt, but there are plenty of servers where they converted the system to that of a newer release, so like taking the system from a 525 that used xml. I see people implement their own systems too. I believe I saw player saving done by json recently…</p>
<p>OP any news on your issue?</p>

</aside>
<p>It really has nothing to do with Settings class.</p>
<p>Go to Player class, and search up for a method called “initialize”, “init” or something like this.</p>
<p>In 667+ it would look similar to this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(getUserName().equalsIgnoreCase("username"))
rights = 1;</code></pre>
<p>In 317</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(c.username.equalsIgnoreCase("username"))
c.rights = 3;</code></pre>
<p>Play a bit around, i’m sure you’re able to figure it out alone.</p>

Hey thanks for helping me out I thought it had something to do with how the format that it was saved in, but how can I change it to .txt I just want to do it to my account because i want to give myself owner rights[/quote]<br>
Or you could refer to the 10001 people that have made a “guide” for giving you owner rights on a 700+ server…<br>
