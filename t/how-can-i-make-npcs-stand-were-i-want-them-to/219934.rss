              <p>open autospawn.cfg and look for the npc id or the shop cooridinates</p>
<p>lets say u wanted to change the fletching shop’s location. search for the current location and u should find something like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 530	XXXX	YYYY	0	0	0	0	0	1	Fletching Shop</code></pre>
<p>the “spawn = 530” is the npc id of the shop owner. the 2 after that are the coordiantes. the rest is what posistion he is facing, walking range, ect.</p>
