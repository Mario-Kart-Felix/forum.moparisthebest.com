    <description>So I did a Mensa home-test (only 31 questions, but still some fun) and my results were &#39;very good&#39;. This obviously has a tremendous effect on my ego :P, but I was wondering if I should bother shelling out €42,50 for an actual IQ test. What&#39;s the point of joining Mensa, apart from bragging rights?

For instance, if I by mere luck pass the test and become a member, is it something you&#39;d put on your résumé?</description>

<p>This is something I’m a bit afraid of. I might act a bit pompous on here at times, but I’m completely different in real life. I don’t like being seen as a know it all, but joining a group that at least from the outside looks like a collection of arrogant jerks might have a negative effect on me.</p>
<p>I’ve skimmed trough MITB’s post (I’ll read it later) and it does give a good reason to become member. What’s more fun than slapping an idiot superior in the face? Even if he’s not a member of Mensa, but act like he’s one, you can still pull out your card.</p>
<p>I guess we’ll have to wait and see. It might have been pure luck that my results were good enough to justify further testing.</p>

              <p>There are reasons you might want to have a Mensa card one day, like if you come across a jerk who uses his to make himself look better than others.  But I wouldn’t put it on my resume for the same reasons Greeny pointed out.</p>
<p>This brought to mind an email I got at the end of the semester from one of my favorite professors during my college years, it talks about a very despicable boss that was a member of mensa, the only edit I am making is stripping out the professors name, I hope he doesn’t care that I shared this with you guys.</p>
<p>It is very long, but it is also a very good read, it’s sad to believe there are actually people like this in the world, worse yet, people with power over others…</p>
<blockquote>Hi Everyone,
<p>I just wanted to take this opportunity to let you know what a privilege it has been to have you in my class and to get to know you.  Every day was a pleasure.  While we probably will never have a class together again I want each and every one of you to know I am still your friend, and you are welcome to stop by my office any time for any reason.  I hope all of you will stay in touch and let me know how things are going.</p>
<p>Right now I’d like to share with you one last story form my past.  The story will serve two purposes; one, it will reveal the nature of my introduction to a nearly useless organization that for one bright shining moment was perfect in its usefulness, and more importantly, it will tie together for you why I have asked you to tell me about yourselves and who influenced you and so on.  Because, you see, there was a reason for it all.  So, here goes…</p>
<p>Back in the early 1990’s soon after getting out of the Air Force, I worked for a very small organization within a very large company (General Dynamics).  We were three people; my boss who was a vice president of GD, his secretary (who had accompanied him throughout his career), and me, his new protégé.  We specialized in organizing interdisciplinary business ventures that included multiple divisions of General Dynamics (GD).  For example, one effort involved teaming with GD Electric Boat, GD AMSEA, and GD Space Systems to build a sea launch capability for launching small sized satellites from a retrofitted pair of oil tankers.  That gives you an idea of the types of projects I worked on.  My boss seemed to spend a huge majority of his time playing politics (back stabbing anyone in his way).  When ever an argument started going a little bad for my boss, he would inevitably whip out his MENSA card and sort of trump the conversation with some arrogant statement about how smart he was and that was that.  For real – yes, irritating children often grow up to be irritating adults.  Anyway, after I watched my boss do this several times, I looked into whether or not I could join MENSA, just in case I ever got in an argument with this guy.  I found out I could by using my SAT and ACT test scores (they still accepted them back then), so I quietly joined and never told anyone about it.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Gulf War 1, GD was actively seeking business opportunities in the clean up and reconstruction efforts.  GD was sorta the “Halliburton” of that war if you will.  My boss had this “brilliant” idea for cleaning up old land mine fields.  His idea was to offer minimum wage jobs to the local people who would then walk into these mine fields with sticks and poke at the ground.  Each one who “found” a land mine would be killed of course.  To the family of each killed worker would go a check for $50.000.  “That much money would be a fortune to these people” my boss explained.  He then gave me the assignment of writing the business case for his idea.  There is no doubt in my mind, that he was correct, and that his idea would be more cost effective (more profitable) than the other ideas, all of which involved big complicated robots and other types of machines to get the same job done.  My boss was giddy with the cleverness of his idea.  But I found it horrifyingly inhumane, and I refused to help him.  Every person he was consigning to death in his retched plan was simply some poor sole trying to feed a family.  They were not enemy soldiers, or even on the other side.  They were on our side, hoping to be able to take good care of their families.  Maybe, they were even looking to America for some hope for a better future.  In any case, they were all good people, and my boss had no problem what so ever with them getting killed.  I mean, he just didn’t get it.  For a whole lot of reasons, I could have no part in this.   Very quickly this argument started going badly for my boss, and yes, he whipped out the ole MENSA card on me.  But before he could go into his homily about how smart he was, I slapped my own MENSA card (all new and shiny) on top of his and told him he would have to do better than that today.  Then I just grinned at him.  There was a long silent pause, and he sent me back to my little office.  Within a week, I was transferred out of his organization, and six months later I was laid-off with about 100 other people.  To be fair, my boss’s idea never got anywhere after I left, I think everyone else in GD had about the same reaction as I did.  My boss got canned not long after I did.</p>
<p>To this day, I get a big smile on my face when I remember how it felt when my boss was so speechless.  It was great!  But, the price was high.  I ended up losing quite a bit in the aftermath of that ordeal.  I tell you this story to make a point; that ethics is not about following rules, it’s about values.  Values are everything.  The key to happiness itself is values – knowing your values and sticking to them.  I believe we each have within ourselves, a part of ourselves that maintains an internal set of values, a part of ourselves that knows exactly what we want and don’t want.  It knows our deepest understanding of what is right, what is wrong, what is good, and what is bad.  It knows these things in a very simple straightforward way, uncomplicated by nuance or caveats.  When a person lives their life in harmony with their internal set of values, they find life generally happy and satisfying, regardless of any external circumstances.  I believe all real validation comes from within, and I further believe the mechanism for maintaining this validation is living one’s life in harmony with one’s own internal set of values.  Nothing else will do as well. Very few people have discovered this.  Because the part that maintains our internal set of values resides very deeply within our subconscious, I think most people are completely unaware of its existence.  As a result, most people seem to live lives of quiet desperation, ever seeking their validation through the approval other people.  This leads to problems, because in their pursuit of the approval of others, people often behave in ways that are wildly out of harmony with their own internal set of values (a set of values these same people don’t even know they have).  This is an obvious source of discord.  Everyday, these people unknowingly add to an incredibly complex web of dissonance within themselves.  Their minds are so cluttered with the noise of these internal conflicts they have a hard time sorting things out, and sometimes act in irrational, and even self-destructive fashions.  Almost all the people we meet live this way, and it isn’t necessary.</p>
<p>It is not my aim to make any value judgments, to say one set of people is better than another; just to say that I think most people are far out of touch with themselves, and as a result are at conflict within themselves.  I’m not even endorsing one set of values over another.  I’m just saying “know yours”.  I further believe that people who are at conflict within themselves are generally much harder to deal with, and require a lot more maintenance in any type of relationship.  The trouble is, pretty much, people are who they are, and most certainly cannot be changed by anyone else.  In fact, the only person who can change someone, is that person them self, and then only with great effort.  It doesn’t happen very often.  So, it is a very precious thing to be in touch with yourself, and to be living in harmony with your own internal set of values.  For these reasons, I encourage each of you to endeavor to become familiar with your own internal set of values.  That way you will be able to choose what is right and what is not right for you to do, and these choices will be easy.  Life will come at you in unexpected ways, and many times situations will not seem so clear.  If you know your values, you will never get tripped up.  You will know what to do.  Probably the easiest way to do this is to learn about the values of the people who were most influential in your lives.  Chances are they passed their values on to you.  For the great majority of you, your parents influenced you the most.  For others your grandparents influenced you, and for others yet, someone else.  No matter who it is, please take the time to get to know these people as well as you possibly can.  In getting to know them, you will get to know their values, and very likely get to know your own values as well.  I think this is more important than anything you will ever learn in any class, and I hope you each think about it a bit and maybe even take it to heart.  Please take the time to get to know the people who most influenced you.  Get to know them as well as you possibly can.</p>
<p>In summary, I recommend you take the time to learn about your own internal set of values, and use them to guide your moral compass.  That way you will never be influenced by or need to rely on others (because they will often lead you astray).  Because it can be difficult to look directly inward, another relatively easy way to learn about your internal set of values is to learn the values of the people who have influenced you the most, usually your parents.  If you follow this simple advice, I think you will find happiness in all you do, no matter what the circumstances.  You will notice that a certain amount of the extra credit in my class involved exercises designed to help get you started.  All you have to do now is follow through.  So, getting back to you why I asked you to tell me about yourselves and who influenced you the most – It was always all for you.</p>
<p>So in closing I want to encourage you to always take good care of yourselves, and at the same time, take good care of other people too.  Good luck and Godspeed in all that you do.</p>

<p>P.S.  Good luck on all your final exams !</p>

<p>Uit de resultaten van de Mensa-thuistest blijkt dat uw intelligentie waarschijnlijk boven het 98e percentiel ligt. Dit betekent dat u, wat betreft uw intelligentie, bij de bovenste twee procent zou behoren. De thuistest is echter geen officiële, geijkte test en geeft alleen een indicatie. Voor toelating tot Mensa moet de Mensa-eindtest worden afgelegd onder toezicht van een psycholoog."</p>
<p>I don’t see why you shouldn’t take the official test, you will most likely pass, as long you are in good shape that day.</p>

<p>True. An IQ test is, AFAIK, more a test to see how good you are at recognizing patterns. An important skill, but not something that means instant success.</p>
<p>I’ll probably do the test. €42,50 isn’t that much, and it would mean a trip to a city I’ve never visited (they only have one test location in the Netherlands). Even if I don’t fit the criteria, the test will be a nice brain exercise.</p>

Could put it on your CV/resume but the risk there is alienating yourself. Some bosses would no doubt think it’s awesome, others might find it threatening.</p>
<p>I was made to do these in school after getting high scores in the CAT exams we have here in the UK.

<p>This thread is now about britfags complaining about Gifted and Talented. The last time I took a CAT was in year 9. I never got into the gifted and talented shit but once I heard about some trips I was interested in I basically forced my way in. I went on some science trips that were fairly decent at the time but it was great because I didn’t go to any of the bullshit things.</p>

              <p>So I did a Mensa home-test (only 31 questions, but still some fun) and my results were ‘very good’. This obviously has a tremendous effect on my ego :P, but I was wondering if I should bother shelling out €42,50 for an actual IQ test. What’s the point of joining Mensa, apart from bragging rights?</p>
<p>For instance, if I by mere luck pass the test and become a member, is it something you’d put on your résumé?</p>
