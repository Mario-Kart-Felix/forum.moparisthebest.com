    <title>Making clients compatible with servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-clients-compatible-with-servers/441576</link>
    <description>I have a PI, and I&#39;m trying to make it compatible with a certain client (377 deob) so it can have an old gameframe. 


Unfortunately, it never successfully connects. I thought it was do to it not having the correct files, so I copied my classes from one client to the new one (377 deob) and compiled. It still didn&#39;t work. Any ideas?

Or could you give me a client (with the old 377 gameframe) that is compatible with PI?

-Thanks.</description>

              <p>The 317 and 377 protocol are different in opcodes. You’re going to have to find a documentation for the 377 protocol or figure out the opcodes yourself. I sort of doubt you’re using a 377 client, however. Most ‘377 clients’ out there are just 317 client that utilize the 377 cache.</p>
