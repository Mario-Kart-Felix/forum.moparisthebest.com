    <title>[317] Resizable, Faster, and better all around</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-resizable-faster-and-better-all-around/314962</link>
    <description>I am upgrading the 317 client and I wish to release it to everyone, I will post my bigger updates here:

[b][i]Updates (log):[/i] [/b] 

  New timing system, 
  New image buffer system, 
  New closing/cleanup system, 
  Countless &#39;tuneups&#39;, 
  Added [b][u]resizing with scaling[/u][/b], 
  Fixed crash while unpacking interfaces, 
  Removed RSA login packet encryption (you can re-add it later if you want), 
  Disabled JAGGRAB (you can re-add it later if you want), 
  Fixed little &#39;smudges&#39; in the client (loading bar offsets, error handling, text display, etc...), 
  Changed cache directory to ./cache/ for my convience (you can change it later if you want)

 And more to come!

[b][i]Download links:[/i][/b]

  Cache included (317 or whatever the MoparScape client provides):
    1. http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?n1tjqhhtmiz
  No cache included
    1. http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?zjzvzdndzy5

 Please report broken link(s), I will post mirrors on request.

[b][i]Future additions (plans):[/i][/b] 

  JOGL, 
  Newest RS2 client processing system, 
  Newest RS2 client compatability, 
  Newest RS2 client graphics system (one buffer for all graphics instead of having one for each section (317 has about 10)), 
  A loader to go along with this (and maybe even a server (with ondemand and jaggrab!))

 And yes..., more to come.

Please request anything you would suggest to be a good update (not just for you, but for everyone), also if you wish to rant about this...go do it somewhere else, I don&#39;t care (I have no idea why you would wan&#39;t to rant about this anyway...).

Do you even know what your talking about? Your post has almost nothing do to with this. I released this soley to be a “base” client for everyone because most client’s with modifications SUCK all the way around 360 degrees boom.</p>

<p>public static long nanoTime()</p>
<pre><code>Returns the current value of the most precise available system timer, in nanoseconds.

This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time. The value returned represents nanoseconds since some fixed but arbitrary time (perhaps in the future, so values may be negative). This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily nanosecond accuracy. No guarantees are made about how frequently values change. Differences in successive calls that span greater than approximately 292 years (263 nanoseconds) will not accurately compute elapsed time due to numerical overflow.

For example, to measure how long some code takes to execute:

   long startTime = System.nanoTime();
   // ... the code being measured ...
   long estimatedTime = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
 

Returns:
    The current value of the system timer, in nanoseconds.

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/silabsoft">@Silabsoft</a>, nano time is better because System.currentTimeMillis uses 10 millisecond precision, nano time uses extremely high precision. System.currentTimeMillis was ment to be used to aquire the current system time which can be changed by the user at any given time. If you read the System.nanoTime documention it mentions that it is primarly used to measure time from point a to point b. Not the case of System.currentTimeMillis[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 19, 2009, 11:05:21 pm[/size][hr]Soon as i get the time i am going to implement this system:</p>

<p>Which is not fully refactored from the rs2 client, but I havent rethought of the proper names since i did this last around 4 months ago.<br>

<p>The client does not use current system time for anything accurate so to change that without a performance increase seems to be rather redundant.  If the client required the current system time for something very accurate the nanosecond would be well worth it.<br>

This method can only be used to measure elapsed time and is not related to any other notion of system or wall-clock time.

This method provides nanosecond precision, but not necessarily nanosecond accuracy. No guarantees are made about how frequently values change.

For example, to measure how long some code takes to execute:

   long estimatedTime = System.nanoTime() - startTime;

<li>According to your profile, you’re 39 years old… REALLY??? damn near 40, messing with RSPS? Don’t you have a life? I mean, teens, that’s understandable. 20’s, you’ve had enough time and exposure that you would be quite knowledgable. 30, that’s kind of pushing it. I think mitb is somewhere around 30, but since he owns the forums, he has an excuse. but 40??? COME ON!!!</li>
