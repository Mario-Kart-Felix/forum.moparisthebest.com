    <title>Help with BCEL Please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-bcel-please/127922</link>
    <description>Hello everybody,

I&#39;m not to active here but I am at many other forums and will be more here.  I have a reflection bot and I have an updater.  The problem is the updater is old and most of the hooks, about 40 of them, have broken because they had bad patterns.  I am pretty new to this area and I don&#39;t know bytecode or BCEL but I do have some knowledge of Java, however it is limited.

I am wondering about solutions for a few problems I am haveing.  First off, I have a list of all the fields I need but I don&#39;t know how to make the methods to find the patterns in the bytecode.  Which leads me to my next problem, I don&#39;t know how to find patterns in the bytecode.  I understand about opening it in CFParse and looking for things that never change, but I have nothing to compair it to so I don&#39;t know what will change and what won&#39;t.

Thank you in advance for those who help and it is much appreciated.

Thanks,
Ronny</description>
