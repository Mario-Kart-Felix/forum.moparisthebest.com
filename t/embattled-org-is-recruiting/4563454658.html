<p>Thank you for your application.<br>
You seem like a satisfactory web developer, however we are looking for a higher calibre of web developer. The bar has already been set at a high point. Sorry for the declination, but perhaps at a later stage when your skills cater to the requirements of Embattled we will reconsider your application.<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>Yeah i use templates because its quicker for me and the people i work with don’t mind it. However Sabatinoscape.tk is about 90% different then how it was originally. Lets take a look at your amazing website.</p>
<p>Your main page consists of a table with text and a link to forum posts and links to other pages. 5 out of 8 of your pages don’t have anything and your Donate page has a table with pictures and a button that PayPal gives you…And finally, your Forums page redirects you to a forum made on SMF which takes 5 min to make and you are using “Blue Star Theme by Sh@rp” template from someone else. You cant really be criticizing my work because I can tell that you spent 15 min on Dreamweaver to make this website. Its nothing special…</p>

<p>And these images were in your /images/ directory, and clearly aren’t used on your site, probably basic images that were used as placeholders. Downloading a template and deleting/changing a couple things does not mean you know web development.<br>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah i use templates because its quicker for me and the people i work with don’t mind it. However Sabatinoscape.tk is about 90% different then how it was originally. Lets take a look at your amazing website.</p>
<p>Your main page consists of a table with text and a link to forum posts and links to other pages. 5 out of 8 of your pages don’t have anything and your Donate page has a table with pictures and a button that PayPal gives you…And finally, your Forums page redirects you to a forum made on SMF which takes 5 min to make and you are using “Blue Star Theme by Sh@rp” template from someone else. You cant really be criticizing my work because I can tell that you spent 15 min on Dreamweaver to make this website. Its nothing special…[/quote]</p>
<p>Let’s not start a flame war, i’ll just state some facts.<br>
I’ve done website development, professionally, for three years.<br>
I started HTML six years ago at a young age, and I’ve worked my way up.<br>
The Blue Start Theme is an SMF theme, I downloaded it as a simple base (considering the fact it’s just basic colors) and modified the colors to suit the current website, as you’ll notice, I designed the standard website first, and create a 65% custom SMF theme to match it, or at least make it look nice. And I also re-coded most of the SMF user panel area, to make it more suitable for the website. And it doesn’t redirect to the forums page, it goes to the forums, which is on the same website, and identical.</p>
<p>Now, let’s go over some of the things you’ve said/flamed me about.</p>
<p>First off, " 5 out of 8 of your pages don’t have anything"<br>
Four of the pages are filled, and for the Highscores page, I’ve been laying out the groundwork for creating my own Hiscores system. As for the Play Now page not having anything, There is nothing to put on the page, seeing as I’ve not been given a webclient to add, because the server hasn’t even been released to BETA mode. Same deal with the Vote page, as soon as I get the vote links i’m going to create an auto-vote system.</p>
<p>Secondly, “your Donate page has a table with pictures and a button that PayPal gives you.” …<br>
This made me chuckle. Unlike most servers, Embattled is going to have a basic donation system, users can donate a pre-defined amount, that amount is stored to the database using a script I made that involves Paypal’s IPN (Instant Payment Notification)-System. The, ‘Images’ on the table are  actually part of a PHP script that gets data from the SQL databases and sorts it into various groups, depending on how much a user has donated. If they’ve donated 1-24$, it displays image1, if they’ve donated 25-49$ it displays image2, and so on. That’s not just a standard table, it’s pulling information from SQL and implementing it, and outputting it with an image, after sorting it and what not.</p>
<p>Now THIS one really made me laugh, “15 min on Dreamweaver to make this website”<br>
You’re the one using Dreamweaver, all of my websites are made completely from scratch, with no special programs, I use a tool called Notepad++ which is basically the standard Windows Notepad program on crack. I use it because it has an amazing Syntax Highlighter. I prefer not to use Dreamweaver for a reason, because from my eyes, it’s a way of cheating. If you’re wanting to learn Web Development, Dreamweaver is not the way to go, as it’s a basic drag-and-drop program, unless you use the code part.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve got nothing else to say… Well, actually, if you’d like, I can teach you proper Website Development, I’m sure I can make some time, we’ll take what little you know, and expand it, so that you know all types of vocabulary and correct terms to use with Website Development. And also, you’ll learn some PHP, SQL, and some Ajax. I can probably even help you learn HTML and Javascript, seeing as you don’t know much about it.</p>
<p>Anyways, let me know if you’d like to accept my offer, always willing to help out fellow Moparscape members!<br>

It's good to see a decent development that's not all about money. You want to create a unique gaming environment for your future players, and for that, I respect you. Anyways, moving on. It looks like you have a great team working with you, so this project shouldn't be half-assed. I'm not trying to be rude, whatsoever. Hopefully you understand what I mean by saying this.
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Also, since I see potential in this project, I may be able to contribute financially in a few weeks or so. I will message you for further details and whatnot.</p>
<p>Again, good luck mate. I expect nothing but the best.  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/coolae52.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>

<p>It’s good to see a decent development that’s not all about money. You want to create a unique gaming environment for your future players, and for that, I respect you. Anyways, moving on.

<p>I really appreciate that. I also see far too many money-hungry servers with nothing unique to offer; just the same old features servers have been offering for years. Immediately in servers such as that you can see they have no passion for the enjoyment the players have, or passion for their server whatsoever, it seems more of an investment rather than a project to bring players enjoyment.</p>
<p>I have been around since 2007, and there has ALWAYS been developers looking for money. I always found it unreasonable that players who are able to produce money are immediately superior to those who cannot. It is completely unfair. So I decided I’d develop a server that offers unique and free features in nearly every aspect, so players who do decide to donate feel like they are investing their money in a server that has a lot to offer, but still get no more advantages than the rest of the players, except recognition of the donation of course.</p>
<p>I’ve been working really hard on Embattled and I am motivated by the originality of it, not money. It is really coming along and I hope it offers players something that they can enjoy and play equally. This is more important now than ever before due to the fact that the first version of Beta is being released in 10 days. I promised the community I would release Beta in September, so that is what I’m doing. I may not get everything I want done, especially in regards to the visual aspects (Interfaces, models, overall client look, website, etc), but I promised that I would release Beta in September and I will, regardless of completion. Although it is all being released in sections, as you can see by either the development post, or the <a href="http://embattled.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Embattled.org</a> announcement, second in the list.</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate your kind words, it really does keep me motivated and focused, so thank you. And in regards to financial contributions, I must stress that all I can offer you is a donator status (which will give you absolutely no advantage in any regard) and the right to request usernames be reserved for you so nobody else takes them. If you are happy to donate with no unfair advantages, then you are more than welcome to. It would be greatly appreciated and would ensure the strength of Embattled, as all donations are saved and go towards advertising.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you!</p>

<p>Thank you. I’m glad you are keeping up with the project. Exactly! It is unfair to those who CANT donate. And I won’t be losing motivation. Beta is coming out very soon.
