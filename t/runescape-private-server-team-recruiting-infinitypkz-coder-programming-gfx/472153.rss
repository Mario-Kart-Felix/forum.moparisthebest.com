    <description>[B]Hello, [/B]

This is the head spokesmen of Team InfinityPkz, and we are now recruiting! This is allowing multiple  opportunities for us and yourself if you are interested.

Me and my buddy are known for the very popular server called &quot;ThaDarkRP or TheDarkRP&quot; GMOD.13 Server. It is currently changing from rank 4-6 on most top-list servers. (Willing to show proof of ownership)

Anyways back onto task, while DarkRP has been updating lately me and my other consultant (If you do play TheDarkRP, you know his as &quot;Timthefunnyman&quot;) have 2 ideas. I&#39;m head of the RSPS that we are setting up, and he is head of the Minecraft PvP server. So we are both working on separate projects until they are fully established.  

[B][U]What we are looking for[/U][/B]
- Coders (We mainly want 1, but if 2 are willing then we will accept)
- Programmers(Which some still may have an experience with both which would be perfect!)
- GFX Artiest (I am experienced with Photoshop so it isn&#39;t &quot;fully&quot; needed, but it would allow me more time to work on the server.)

[U][B]If you&#39;re interest in a roll for InfinityPkz, then please fill out the form below.[/B][/U]
