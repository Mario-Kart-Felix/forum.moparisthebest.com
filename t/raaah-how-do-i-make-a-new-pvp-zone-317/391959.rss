    <title>Raaah! How do I make a new PVP zone? [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/raaah-how-do-i-make-a-new-pvp-zone-317/391959</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;m Delta or PI! I checked multiple guides for both, my source has none of the stuff it says in them. I know its not that mine just doesnt have any and i have to custom make it, because I already have 2 PK zones in my server.

Could anyone give me some help? If anyone could either show me how or I have a teamviewer if that&#39;ll help. I made a backup of my server as it is ATM because screwing my server up is not how I want to do it.</description>

<p>Just search for Wild and you should see a bunch of things with coordinates. One should say PvP or Fala or something, and under that will be all of the coordinates for pvp zones.</p>

<p>Hmm… must not be PI. The only things with Wild in my Player.java are -</p>
<p>public boolean IsInWilderness = false;</p>
<p>and before that these</p>
<pre><code>public boolean inwildy = false;
public boolean inwildy2 = false;</code></pre>
