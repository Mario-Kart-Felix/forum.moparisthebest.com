    <description>When i downloaded the client and source of massacred world economy i was very excited because i have played on servers with this source and client because it is a very fun one. I am new to java and stuff and am having problems already for one thing, in the massacred world source when you hit run to get the client up it doesnt work it just has the cmd thing up and tells you to hit enter so it disappears? (the system cannot find the specified path) also if that is fixable where do you put ur ip from no-ip? in the source or client and if in the source or client where in there would i need to change it?</description>
