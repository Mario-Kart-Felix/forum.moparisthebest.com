    <description>So whats different about Runescape Revamped?

Very simply I want  to add 3 new skills to my server along with changing some of the already well know Runescape armour and also model some of my own cosmetic gear. Firstly let me show you what I have done with the server before I had these ideas.

Well now me and Hadlich4 have joined together to start adding more unique content and combine our ideas in one server.

Green = Finished
Orange = Almost finished
 Red = Just started
 Purple = My Dreams

Credits to Insidiax for base source

100% Prayers including Turmoil and Soulsplit
100% magicks (Ancients and Lunars)
Jad with 63 waves and no logging out to start waves
Chaotics
Full summoning (Doing something with scrolls)
Fully working Crucible
Unique custom home (made for fun)
Full Squeal of fortune
Automated Double xp weekends (for when I host)
Godwars with kill count
Full Dagganoths
Grand exchange
All pets
rewritten Price loading
Full Nex and Nomad
Full King Black Dragon
Full Tormented Demons
Unique teleporting  interface
All specials work
HD and Full screen

working on being able to have pets attack for you in the wilderness
Almost 100% skills just scrolls not working yet
Degrading Pk armour with correct degrading times
Grand exchange with no bugs
Miasmic Barrage

Clan wars 
Castlewars
Duo Slayer
Multi cannon


Now welcome to my wildest dreams!!! 
Let me tell you about my ideas

PK Level: Now most people will have seen this skill in Insidiax where the more people you kill whilst pking the higher you Pking level becomes. But if you die your Pking level will decrease. I thought that making PK armours degrade would be a good idea. After that I thought that if you increased your pking level that would mean that the Pk armour would degrade slower.

Enchanting: This skill needs alot of work but hopefully one day it will become a reality. This skill needs other skills to level it and it incorporates Magic and Crafting. With this skill I will have to create a new magic tab to hold all the spells needed to level enchanting. I am hoping someone will release a 751 client and cache so I can rip the spell book interface. To level Enchanting you need Cut gems (hence why you need crafting) and the magic spells that I am making these different runes will cost alot more and will be able to enchant every weapon and armour in the game. But for example to enchant Torva you will need a cut Onyx and a certain amount of what ever runes I create (These will be expensive) I am also working on how much they will boost the stats and how the look of the item will change. upon using the enchanted gem on the weapon the get will disappear and the value of the item will increase (Depending on the level needed to enchant it.

Necromancy: Now this is why I haven&#39;t added scrolls as this skill will mean that scrolls will be useless. This is basically a skill where I will yet again have to make another magic spell book slot. ( note the enchanting and Necromancy spell books will not need to be changed at an altar I am going to add tabs. This skill will use summoning and will let you summon dark creatures and let you cast new spells. Like: Dark void (If you are being farcasted in the wilderness you can cast this spell and it will teleport your attacker away.

Note I am not giving full information about my skills as I do not want leechers taking my idea.
If you want to help please reply with your name, age, coding history and skype name (if you wish)

Hope you will enjoy this and will add pictures when I have time 
Thanks for your time
