    <description>i download a blank 317 source. dont know if its a pi or not didnt say in the thing but my autofil is all screwed it it doesnt even make any sense its goes like this.

//spawn----cord x---cordy----descprition


well that nots exactly what ithe file looks like but its a brand new file and it doesnt ask for the npc id so its basically telling me to not spawn npc&#39;s and i really need a working template to work with similar to this. i know its not going to exactly look like this but, atleast youll know what i mean

spawn-npcid----cord x----cord y------despcrition
          3453      3455        2342           shopsman
like somthing like that to start me off but i mean like a working template i cna start spawning stuff from. the one the guy gave me isnt a template and it makes no sense. ive seen the real ons from previous server and it looked nuthing close the real template to use for spawning npcs.


i would really appreciate i i somone could help me place. wait hold on ill copy and past what the template is the guy gave me below instead of giving you my crap description:


here it is:
/      spawnX    spawnY   height      walk      maxhit      attack     defence      description
//spawn = 461	3222	32216	0	0	  0	  0	     die


thats what i have for my template and i know its wrong!


and i also need help with making the teleports. you know how in the old mod allstar servers you click on the emote tab and you saw option like pkbox and teampk and you click on the little boxes and they teleported you to that place. my server has thouse boxes but how to i make them have letters in it to click on and teleport me places?</description>
