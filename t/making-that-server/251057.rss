    <title>Making that server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-that-server/251057</link>
    <description>I had a server from scratch but only had talking working.
and walking and stuff.
But then, i released my v8 server based on deltascape everyone started calling me a leecher when i gave credits.
So then, i started making my scratch server after a week ago. Then yesterday i thought of thoses idiots so i deleted it.
Do you think and honest answer should i quit moparscape?
