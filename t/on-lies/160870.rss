    <title>On Lies</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/on-lies/160870</link>
    <description>Who am I to tell you about lies? A liar. 

The first lie is that there is truth. Truth is not. Truth does not take place within time but is without presence or substance. Truth is the lack of illumination and thought. Knowledge is bliss, lies build the foundation for thought. The dog asleep and the wallpaper are truth. 

The nation, the state, these are not built on lies but are the very embodiment of the first lie. Within the community the individual slowly disappears. The labor beyond necessary means to survive is expressed in money and artificial splendor is the result of money. The platinum and gold plated wristwatch tells time no better or worse than the free McDonald&#39;s plastic.

The second lie is that you are alive right now. You are dying. When animals get old, in nature, they die. Old age is unnatural. Ancient tribes protected their elders once like precious wisdom stolen from god. Now we don&#39;t know what to do with all the decrepit, the old, the retarded and disgusting, because we don&#39;t know what to do with ourselves.

The third lie is motion. Violence, force, reality, time. A clever illusion all in one. How many times today did your ask yourself &quot;Am I dreaming?&quot;.   Wake up. Somebody is knocking at your door. Open it and accept somebody quite like yourself. They want to ask you, what happened? I used to be happy, I used to go out and do things. Doing and thinking, the same in a healthy man. Happiness is nothingness. Time happens all at once.


Do you want to know what went wrong with America? Ask a woman. What is fashion? The fourth lie is beauty.

When people are in charge of other people it is always the same. First the followers must believe a lie. Any lie. It could be as simple as &quot;I know better than you what you should do, with yourself.&quot; Doing is thinking. All thought requires a solid foundation of lies. Pure action, pure thought, truth.  Lie, think, steal. 

What is sex? A physical activity shared. The value of reproduction is gone, wiped away from our page in history. Our great grandchildren will ask our radioactive ashes why we just kept on fucking and making babies and laughing at those cute little things they did while we let machines rape the planet all around us. Something cute. I won&#39;t ever breed.

A War on Terror. Go now and put out a fire with fire, and you shall see a war on terror. Go now and drive down to the gas station, if you want to know why we still fight then. If you do not fight a lie, you become part of it.</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Who am I to tell you about lies? A liar.</p>
<p>The first lie is that there is truth. Truth is not. Truth does not take place within time but is without presence or substance. Truth is the lack of illumination and thought. Knowledge is bliss, lies build the foundation for thought. The dog asleep and the wallpaper are truth.</p>
<p>The nation, the state, these are not built on lies but are the very embodiment of the first lie. Within the community the individual slowly disappears. The labor beyond necessary means to survive is expressed in money and artificial splendor is the result of money. The platinum and gold plated wristwatch tells time no better or worse than the free McDonald’s plastic.</p>
<p>The second lie is that you are alive right now. You are dying. When animals get old, in nature, they die. Old age is unnatural. Ancient tribes protected their elders once like precious wisdom stolen from god. Now we don’t know what to do with all the decrepit, the old, the retarded and disgusting, because we don’t know what to do with ourselves.</p>
<p>The third lie is motion. Violence, force, reality, time. A clever illusion all in one. How many times today did your ask yourself “Am I dreaming?”.   Wake up. Somebody is knocking at your door. Open it and accept somebody quite like yourself. They want to ask you, what happened? I used to be happy, I used to go out and do things. Doing and thinking, the same in a healthy man. Happiness is nothingness. Time happens all at once.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what went wrong with America? Ask a woman. What is fashion? The fourth lie is beauty.</p>
<p>When people are in charge of other people it is always the same. First the followers must believe a lie. Any lie. It could be as simple as “I know better than you what you should do, with yourself.” Doing is thinking. All thought requires a solid foundation of lies. Pure action, pure thought, truth.  Lie, think, steal.</p>
<p>What is sex? A physical activity shared. The value of reproduction is gone, wiped away from our page in history. Our great grandchildren will ask our radioactive ashes why we just kept on fucking and making babies and laughing at those cute little things they did while we let machines rape the planet all around us. Something cute. I won’t ever breed.</p>
<p>A War on Terror. Go now and put out a fire with fire, and you shall see a war on terror. Go now and drive down to the gas station, if you want to know why we still fight then. If you do not fight a lie, you become part of it.</p>
