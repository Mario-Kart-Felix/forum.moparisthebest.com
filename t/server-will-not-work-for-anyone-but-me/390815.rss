    <title>Server. will. not. work. for anyone but me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-will-not-work-for-anyone-but-me/390815</link>
    <description>So i have this server thats 317, im sure i have the info right but it just wont go online for anyone but me!

I can get on FINE with mopar, but nobody else can with the site or mopar.

http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=30cp2s3&amp;s=7
Thats what it loads for me on my webclient, after that part it just fails and says &quot;Error Connecting to Server&quot; for some reason. Other people it just goes straight to cant connect to server, retrying in x
x being the number of seconds

Nobody else can even get on the mopar. What can i do :(</description>

<p>Again, like I said. Just because the router config says that the port is open, doesn’t mean connections will reach your computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://cmyip.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cmyip.com/</a></p>
<p>Go there, type in the port number, if it says error, it’s not open.[/quote]</p>
<p>I know, i know.<br>
<a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a> says that it could not reach the port because “the port refused”<br>
Ugh! I keep trying to fix it but something else always goes wrong.</p>

Wtf? Error: I could not see your service on 69.116.49.102 on port (43594)<br>
Reason: Connection timed out</p>
<p>It says that (minus the wtf)<br>
I checked my firewall, the port is definitly open. I made two exceptions for that port just to make sure.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Obviously it’s not open. That tool was made by the same people who made No-IP. When I opened my ports, it told me so.<br>
Some routers just don’t like it. Like a lot of linksys routers. And it could also be your ISP blocking it.[/quote]</p>
<p>I double checked. I made 2 exceptions in my firewall and another in my router. How can i fix the isp block?</p>

<p>Command Prompt, type ipconfig and it should show you a huge list of results, but if that’s your ipv4, make sure that it’s enabled, and that your  router is accepting incoming connections.[/quote]</p>
