<p>Only 1-3 was following them… And they had private offline.</p>
<p>And also, why are they walking around? That’s what I am saying.<br>
Is it because it was a free world?<br>
Is it because they want some fun?<br>
Well, how can you have fun with some emotes that your company has build for some ages ago? -.-[/quote]<br>
You fucking kidding me?  Maybe he likes the emote?  Maybe he enjoys the newer animations on it?  You question why the mod walks around when you’re the dick that’s GE standing.</p>

<p>Mod Weaths sole job at the moment is muting/locking the gold selling adverts. He’s doing his job, would you like people following you asking questions while you were trying to make a living? I wouldn’t…</p>
<p>There are mods whose job it is to talk to players in game and on the forums, if you find one of them in game I’m sure they’ll answer your questions.</p>

But you were recommended for a reason, they aren’t going to recommend you for picking on people all day long.</p>

<p>Like Davidi2 said, they probably have jobs just like everyone else and get on RS to play for fun and relieve stress.  He’s just trying to enjoy the game without getting pestered by 12 year olds who are too stupid to use the forums when they want to ask a question. (No offense to 12 year olds, just the one who made this topic, and is keeping it alive).</p>

              <p>If they weren’t ment to help a player ingame then why have the crown showing ingame? I mean you’ve no way of contacting a normal Mod or Admin if you need help other then Report or through email, they should really have an ingame ticket maker so you can TALK to the Mods and Admins. What is the use of them being marked to help if they’re just going to sit around, they need to pull their heads out of their arses and get a move on. I know if i was the owner of a big company like jagex i wouldn’t want to pay people to stand around and relieve some stress on my time.</p>

<p>Honestly, they have a full time job doing other stuff, it isn’t their job to talk to you in-game. They need stress relief somewhere, right? There are mods that are paid to talk to people, both in-game and out, obviously this mod isn’t one of them. Don’t get butthurt because he wouldn’t talk to you.</p>
