first post your internet speed and also go to control panel &gt;system and it will have your processing speeds as well as your ram. post the processes to give us a better idea.<br>

<p>What? If he’s home hosting the chances are his processors are jammed with shit anyway, the guy with the 256MB vps and an old OS is probably using a vps, or has a stable source or both. Also, the OS can affect it by how much RAM it uses. Like I’ve said 3 times, <span class="bbcode-b"> You cannot tell how many people a server will hold just by guessing .</span> I suggest attacking you’re own server and finding out.</p>

<p>Like i said in my previous post, you can “estimate”, but you can’t give an exact amount. Anything can effect how the server is ran at any given moment, estimating wouldnt be completely inacurate. I suggest you do a trial and error like I did with my server, put it on the status page, get as many players as you can and if it laggs and crashes, so be it atleast you know the answer. If you told us which base you where using we might be able to give you a “Not many” or “You could hold a few” type estimate. If you want a stable server i suggest moving away from wL (I’m not going to go on and on because i still use wL.) You could try something like Hyperion, or Yz’s base, RS2DV (All can be found in the downloads section).</p>
<p>But when you download them they don’t run on a regular ‘run’ batch file, so it requires you to do something (It’s not rocket science, just follow the tutorial given) It also isn’t a matter of just moving things, you have to know what your doing or you’re going to look at it and just think “What the hell am i doing here?”.</p>
