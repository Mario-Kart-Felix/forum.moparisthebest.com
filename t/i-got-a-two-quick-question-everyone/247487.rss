    <title>I got a TWO QUICK question everyone!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-got-a-two-quick-question-everyone/247487</link>
    <description>Ok well I&#39;ve coded two servers I believe are either 317 or 377 I don&#39;t know really (I released All Bout Pk V1 and V2). I&#39;m moving into the 508s and I&#39;m just wondering if the coding is the same (other than player. = p.) . I&#39;ve tried to make myself Owner by changing everyhting that says palidino76 in the login.JAVA to my username of the client, but whenever I compile (yes the compiler (all) is set to my jdk) I always get errors....... I would greatly appreciate it if you helped me out here.

Thank You,
