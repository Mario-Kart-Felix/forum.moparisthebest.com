    <title>How to add the working ring of wealth into game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-the-working-ring-of-wealth-into-game/549471</link>
    <description>The item is already in the files I was just wondering how to go about editing it&#39;s special and what would it look like.  Maybe even knowing where it should be located I could find the ring of recoil and go from there. And also I know full construction is a rather long and drawn out process and for now i just have a planking system in game I would like to know where to start with in the actual coding portion of construction.  I know the dialogue among other things outside the actual skill would have to change I&#39;m just wondering as far as new files what would have to be added.</description>

              <p>So the effect of the ring doesn’t need to be added into the files.  That was my question sorry if i made it seem like it was something else.</p>

              <p>You can find how the ring of wealth works on the rs wiki. So you would just code it into your dropping method then.</p>
