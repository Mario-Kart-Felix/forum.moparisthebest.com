    <title>Java Null Pointer Exception</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-null-pointer-exception/101186</link>
    <description>Hi I have a PKBox on my server, and this code checks if the attack and the victim are in the box.:
[code]if (inPkBox == true &amp;&amp; AttackingOn2.inPkBox == false)
{
sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t attack players that aren&#39;t in the Pking Box!&quot;);
ResetAttack();
} [/code]
 But, if you attack a player out of the box, instead of the sendMessage, the server crashes with a Java NullPointer Exception. (And AttackingOn2 IS set to the client that is being attacked.) [code]public boolean Attack() {
		int EnemyX = PlayerHandler.players[AttackingOn].absX;
		int EnemyY = PlayerHandler.players[AttackingOn].absY;
		int EnemyHP = PlayerHandler.players[AttackingOn].playerLevel[playerHitpoints];
		int EnemyHPExp = PlayerHandler.players[AttackingOn].playerXP[playerHitpoints];
                client AttackingOn2 = (client) server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn];
		client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[AttackingOn];
		boolean RingOfLife = false;
		if (PlayerHandler.players[AttackingOn].playerEquipment[playerRing] == 2570) {
			RingOfLife = true;
		}
if (inPkBox == true &amp;&amp; AttackingOn2.inPkBox == false)
{
sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t attack players that aren&#39;t in the Pking Box!&quot;);
ResetAttack();
} 
[/code]

Any idea on what I did wrong?</description>
