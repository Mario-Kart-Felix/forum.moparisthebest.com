With a week to go until Election Day, a little Ralph Nader rally within the crucial battleground condition of Michigan had not been anything to brag about, and it hardly looked like a threat to Al Gore&#39;s campaign.But nationwide surveys are showing Nader using four to five percent with the vote in some crucial states  and that anxieties the Gore campaign. Even with calls from some Democrats for Nader to stop, he&#39;s charging ahead.On Tuesday, he launched a new air war; a cynical jab with what Nader has referred to as &quot;arrogancy&quot; of both the Democratic and also Republican parties.&quot;When I develop, I want to be disillusioned, disenchanted, disenfranchised. When I become adults I want politicians to disregard me,&quot; say children in the Tv set ad. Then an announcer intones, &quot;Is that what you want coming from government?&quot;Democratic Party colleagues argue that the people being released for Nader would in fact vote for Vice President Gore if Nader were not running. However, Nader claims these are independents, first-time voters and folks from both parties who&#39;re fed up. As for Nader, there is not any turning back; he will not care who&#39;s selected and he&#39;s confident he owes nothing to  Gore. He told Abc News Correspondent Phil Smith he doubts either Gore or George M. Bush will pay manual intervention to to your ex if they&#39;re elected.&quot;I&#39;ve had eight years experience with Al Gore,&quot; he states. &quot;I couldn&#39;t even make sure he can go down three blocks to the Capitol Hilton and deal with one thousand leaders involving environmental, consumer, labor, minority, civil privileges, women&#39;s rights groupings  all groups which might be in Washington. He couldn&#39;t be troubled, nor could Invoice Clinton.&quot;Nader will not stop. Success for him will be receiving the five percent he or she needs to qualify their Green Party regarding millions of dollars in federal matching funds. In the event that those votes are derived from Al Gore, Nader doesn&#39;t care.  [url=http://www.shinglespringsdreamhomes.com/guccioutlet.html]gucci outlet online[/url]
