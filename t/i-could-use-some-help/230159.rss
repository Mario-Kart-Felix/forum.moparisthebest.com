    <description>hey, today something bad happened to me  shifty
i was just hosting my server (it&#39;s been for a month got loads of players etc)
all of a sudden, today i disconnected and it happened
i was the only one able to log on anymore.
i am wondering if this happened to someone else before? cause this is odd.
i didn&#39;t change any things yet. like firewall. orso.
i ran my server with firewall on.
i tried to shut it down to see if that helped but no.
i have no-ip which didn&#39;t work for me after all.
what should i do
