    <description>Is there any possible way for a co-owner to be able to start the server when I am not on?

Like if it goes down, because I have been off for a while and i want him to start it.
I don&#39;t want to send the source file. because i dont know what he could do.
please help!!
also is there a mute command for testscape?

help appreciated :)</description>
