    <title>A New Project?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-new-project/463664</link>
    <description>Now couldn&#39;t decide where to put my new project at on server development, general discussion, or this topic, but after seeing my goal It decide to post it here.

Now my project goal. is known as khq....what does that mean? Well it means kingdom hearts quest lol.
I will be creating Kingdom Heart models in order to create one epic adventure.

But I need your help...I would like suggestions on who want to be the final boss or what mini bosses you want to see.  If this project is a huge hit I will post a TUT on the downloads and how to instal this quest.

Purpose? Well I heard from when I was starting out making a Server is that if you want people to join it you need a WOW factor..., so I think this would count as a WOW factor..right?

The story-King Mickey arrives on your world (which is the server) and tells you that Sora is lost in darkness by a unknown person and your job is to find out who took Sora and his heart and rescue Sora from the darkness.

I know its a pretty simple story, but during your journey you will be given a random keyblade (I&#39;m thinking out of 5) to try and save Sora.  I&#39;m also thinking about adding Riku as a mini boss because I&#39;ll add that he went in the darkness to try and save Sora, but ends up giving in back to darkness.

As a bonus event after the quest you will be able to try and get Terra&#39;s armor and keyblade, Ventus&#39;s armor and keyblade, and Aqua&#39;s armor and keyblade by fighting a Terra, Ventus, and Aqua NPC.

I would like to here some ideas you have about this project or suggestions.  I will be updating this topic as I gain progress.</description>
