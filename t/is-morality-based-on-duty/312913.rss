    <description>Sorry to post this but I&#39;m out of options, for philosophy I have to write a 600 word essay on &quot;Is morality based on duty&quot; I have no idea where to start, I&#39;ve Google&#39;d the fuck out the question and haven&#39;t found anything useful.

<p>Morality defines what is right and what is wrong. Right or wrong is different for each person. If a duty doesn’t fit with your morality, you will hesitate to perform that duty, or you simply won’t do it. If you think defending your country is morally right, you will do everything your commander tells you to do.</p>

              <p>Duty would be what someone else has told you to do.</p>
<p>Morality would be something you believe and do.</p>
<p>Morality is based on Duty because to your morals are your duty’s, if you do not have any morals, then you have no duty unless placed on you by someone older, etc… Like in the Military most of the men have religious set morals… Lets take the war in Iraq for example.</p>
<p>The fighters for Iraq are doing it because their religious morals are their duty. If they do not do it, they believe that they will die of sin and wrongful things.</p>
<p>But if their commanding officer = Saddam would enforce duty’s upon them to kill the Americans.</p>
<p>In the United states the solider’s have a duty to defend their home land. But most of them have it set as a moral to defend their home land. Basically its a free opinion that is in either way correct. So you can be correct no matter what you say.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I know but a bit part of it could be “It’s not based on duty because it is based on x because y”</p>
<blockquote>When someone recognizes a duty, that person commits himself/herself to the cause involved without considering the self-interested courses of actions that may have been relevant previously. This is not to suggest that living a life of duty precludes one from the best sort of life, but duty does involve some sacrifice of immediate self-interest.</blockquote>
<p>How can duty be based on morals when you don’t sacrifice something, and it is in your own interests to help others?</p>
<p>Every action is in our own interest - even if someone donates lots of money towards research for a sickness they don’t have, they wouldn’t do it if they didn’t feel good about it.</p>
