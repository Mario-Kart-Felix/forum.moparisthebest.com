    <title>Fucked up my XP installation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fucked-up-my-xp-installation/172457</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m on my PC, turned it off at the wrong moment.  Some shit got corrupted, so I repaired my Windows installation.  Noting the extremely long start-up times (in the ballpark of a minute to go from fully off to Opera open and browsing), I also found out that I had to update my installation, as my repaired install of SP 1a had partially overwritten my SP 2 installation.  I also found out that updating was impossible, as my ntoskrnl.exe seemed to be corrupted.  Deciding this was too much for me to waste my time on, and having a week&#39;s worth of homework waiting to be finished, I&#39;m going to fully reinstall Windows, for the second time in a month.  How is the best way for me to go about transferring my programs and settings?  I copied my Program Files folder to an external drive, as well as the Documents and Settings folder (including the Application Data folders).  I also backed up my registry, though I fear that simply overwriting a fresh registry with the backed up one may cause problems.  In addition, I had the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard create a settings file on the external HDD as well.

To sum it all up, I&#39;m going to reinstall Windows.  Can you guys help me ensure it is as smooth as possible?  Any tricks, tips, programs, etc?</description>

              <p>Sorry, I misinterpreted what you had originally said  :o.</p>
<p>For the programs, it would probably just be easier if you still had the installers to copy them to the external HDD and then just re-install, I’d personally not recommend replacing a registry with a backup, just because of all of the things that can go wrong.</p>
<p>If you want to transfer windows settings, I’m pretty sure the Files and Settings Transfer wizard can do that for you.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be bold and try to copy the existing directories of programs, as well as their registry keys, in theory it could work, but it’s probably not a good idea, a fresh installation is probably best (if you have the installers, that is).</p>

<p>I understand what the registry is, and that it is recreated on fresh installation.</p>
<p>As I said, I want to just copy and paste to have my programs up and working.  I don’t want to have to torrent installers and reinstall everything and set up my settings for each program.  I just did it a month ago.</p>
<p>The registry replaces the .ini file.  It contains options and settings for most installed programs, and I’m pretty sure it is “important.”  If you have a source that says otherwise, then let me know.</p>

<p>I appreciate your post, but you’re really not telling me anything I don’t already know.  You don’t think that being the 3rd biggest spammer here, I would not have heard anything about Linux here?

I also found out that updating was impossible, as my ntoskrnl.exe seemed to be corrupted.  Deciding this was too much for me to waste my time on, and having a week’s worth of homework waiting to be finished, I’m going to fully reinstall Windows, for the second time in a month.  How is the best way for me to go about transferring my programs and settings?  I copied my Program Files folder to an external drive, as well as the Documents and Settings folder (including the Application Data folders).  I also backed up my registry, though I fear that simply overwriting a fresh registry with the backed up one may cause problems.  In addition, I had the Files and Settings Transfer Wizard create a settings file on the external HDD as well.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, I’m going to reinstall Windows.  Can you guys help me ensure it is as smooth as possible?  Any tricks, tips, programs, etc?</p>
