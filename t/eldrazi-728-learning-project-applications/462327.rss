    <description>Hey, well as some of you may remember Eldrazi 604. I released it a year ago. Well i decided to remake it using Matrix. Yeah i know (Leech, N3RD, l2makeurownsource ect. ect.) but hey i don&#39;t think anyone makes there own source. Technically everyone who codes rsps leeched from moparisthebest, since he made the first if not one of the first private servers.


Moving on, I have been working on this server for a few weeks. But i found out i couldnt port forward anymore, my friend/partner is offering to pay for a dedi server next month. But i want the server to be perfect before we release :) This is where the applications come in, i want to learn more about Java and im pretty sure alot of you do aswell. But one of the first projects i was in didn&#39;t turn out all to good i was kicked for not knowing enough. Which is why i am doing this, you will have a chance to learn more and not be kicked because u won&#39;t actually be apart of a project until you prove yourself of being worthy :p

<p>Why not make the ladderhandler? Just put the stair ids in an enum and say for each enum id increase c.heightLevel.</p>

<p>What?.. He disabled it because currently in the Matrix source, you can click a ladder through a wall and go up a level because it literally just looks at the name of the object, checks if the name is ladder or stairs, and puts you up a level lol. Massive noclipping.</p>
<p>Your way of a ladder handler is over-complicating the problem.</p>
