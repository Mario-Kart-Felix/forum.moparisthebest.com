    <title>[317][PI] - Ipbanned myself, Please Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-pi-ipbanned-myself-please-help/543736</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I was currently testing out the command ::ipban, but i had no one to test it on so i used it on myself thinking that i would be able to just delete my ip from the &quot;Ipsbanned&quot; list, but when i deleted my IP from the list: i still cant log in.

Can someone please help me out because i am the owner of the server and cant even log into it from my IP.

(I can&#39;t use the &quot;::unipban&quot; because i can&#39;t log in to use it!)</description>

              <p>Restart your server. Lol.<br>
PI’s have a temporary list that’s built when the server is started, reading the data from ipsbanned.txt. The list is modified when you do the commands respectively, along with the file.<br>
Removing your name from the .txt doesn’t change the list that’s in the server unless you did the ::unip command.<br>
So yeah, just restart your server after removing your own IP.</p>
