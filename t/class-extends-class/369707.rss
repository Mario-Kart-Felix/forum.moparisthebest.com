    <description>Is it possible for me to extend more than one class in any one class?

[code]
/*
 *Example
 */

public class Mendorphins extends Example extends AnotherExample {
}
[/code]

If not, is there a proper way of doing this?</description>

<p>I understand exactly what you just said, so I will begin to re-write. I also want GUI (which I have the resources) so I can scrap the batch file.</p>

<p>I did create public voids in each class (not the public class) but they gave more errors, and I did have ReadFirst, ReadSecond etc. in seperate Java files, but that did not work either.</p>
<p>So I wanted the output to print all of the elements of:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">String[] fs1 = { "element1 ", "element2 ", "etc. " };</code></pre>
<p>into the batch when I called it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Example for Initialize.bat

Element found: element1
Element found: element2
Element found: etc.
press any key to continue...</code></pre>
<p>But instead it prints all six strings and how many elements are in those strings, not the actual words.</p>
<p>Hope this is a little bit more thorough.</p>
