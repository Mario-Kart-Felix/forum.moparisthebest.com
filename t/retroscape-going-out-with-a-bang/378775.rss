<p>Dont get all up and anti about my post, everybody is allowed their opinon as this is an open source community :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Fair dues, everyone has their own opinion, I respect that. But this is my last Server and i’m trying to put everything i’ve learnt to make it’s highest possible standards it should be.</p>

<p>How old are you? 15</p>
<p>How long have you been coding Java? 0 years. I’m not a JAVA coder… hence server mod &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Do you code any other language except from Java? eerr… no.</p>
<p>Why would you like to join? I’ve got free time and I make a nice moderator.</p>
<p>Do you have; msn, ventrio, email or skype? I’m pretty sure you need an email to sign up. I have msn, I’ll use if you want. It’s only a moderator position though.</p>
<p>Any other information can be posted here.<br>
I don’t have any java experience because I make models…<br>
Anyway I’m a good moderator, I know what to do when people are breaking the rules, acceptable punishments, ect. I also try to maintain perfect spelling and grammar. If you care, that is.[/quote]</p>
<p>Reyx7, accepted as Moderator and Modeler, that’s if you want to model for us.<br>
And grammar would be nice :).</p>

I have alot of experience regarding community management, dealing with people and such.</p>
<p>Also, I understand that age can be a difficult thing to deal with, as most my age are very, very immature. I assure you that this will not be occuring with me, as I despise immaturity.</p>
<p>I will look forward to discussing things with you on msn, if you would like to do such. Also, I’m from Denmark if it has any relevance.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Penetration, post:2, topic:378775”]What are you applying for?<br>
Forums Developer, Forums Administrator, and Server Administrator.</p>
<p>How old are you?<br>
13</p>
<p>How long have you been coding Java?<br>
Not long. PHP and HTML for 3 years now, more info over MSN.</p>
<p>Do you code any other language except from Java?<br>
PHP, HTML.</p>
<p>Why would you like to join?<br>
I’d like a server to do work for and be staff on at the same time.</p>
<p>Do you have; msn, ventrio, email or skype?<br>

<p>Any other information can be posted here (optional, it helps lots).<br>
I do paid gigs for web development, I’m damn good with vBulletin, and my best friend is 21 and owns a company called Mabroli, which sells VPSs, Dedicated Servers, and webhosting to BIG sites/companies. I can get a deal on a Linux VPS’s or Windows VPS’s at unbelievable prices. The Linux VPS’s are able to be used with VNC, which is Remote Desktop but for Linux, and he’ll help you do most stuff. I also know how to avoid copyright claims, etc. I know the best offshore hosts(I’ve been hosting warez for half a year now), and the worst offshore hosts(EchoHosting, no dip). I sell Windows 7 Ultimate, and Microsoft Office 2010 Professional licenses. Umm, too much to say, hehe.[/quote]</p>
<p>Do you have any proof (pictures) of your “Forum Creating” skills?</p>
