<p>With a good processor and other hardware, yes. How many people your PC is able to deal with at a time is almost entirely dependent on how the server source is coded. If it’s shitty, like 90%+ of current servers, it won’t be able to handle very many; but for some of the newer sources that people are denying simply because it’s ‘difficult’, you’d probably be able to hold upwards of 500-1,000.</p>

<p>Where could I get a base like that?<br>
Or do I have to start from blank? ;&lt;</p>

<p>I was able to have 30 steady with half a gig of RAM, but that was before 377’s came out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>As for this topic, it’s the stability of the source, not as much RAM.</p>
