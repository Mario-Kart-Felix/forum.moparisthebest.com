    <title>Playing by yourself</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/playing-by-yourself/40035</link>
    <description>I really don&#39;t understand the 127.0.0.1 IP when you start MoparScape. In the FAQ&#39;s it says this is for playing by yourself(only you, no one else) yet, it never loads. I really need help on how to play by yourself. 

Also, I started a new server (HAM) and don&#39;t really know what do to. If someone could please help me with that to please. 

Thanks.</description>

              <p>127.0.0.1 Is your localnetwork like its your ip not the internet ip.<br>
To find out your internet ip click on the two flashing computers at the bottom right corner…<br>
Or if you don’t see it open network connections from Control panel to check out what is your ip…<br>
If you have a router it won’t tell you real ip… go to <a href="http://www.whatsmyip.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.whatsmyip.org/</a> it will tell your ip<br>
You can advertise that but people use no-ip to hide their IP.<br>
By The way If you have router and you have Hamachi you don’t need portforwarding,<br>
How ever You do for no-ip and For hamachi you click on create a network [find that out your self]<br>
then make up a Name and password that you will remember it is case Sensetive so copy and paste it<br>
into a note pad file and save it to remember it.<br>
Then advertise your Hamachi ip your network’s password and Network name, Make sure your server is running.<br>
Thank me if i helped.<br>
