        <p>What’s going on? I’ve been looking around here over the last few months and have seen nothing done. Wheres the servers that try to emulate the good old RSC? if you all seem to think RSCDaemon was already finished then your very wrong.</p>
<p>RSCDaemon has hundreds of little bugs/missing features that i know many of you don’t know about, quite a few of you can fix these bugs probably. All i am seeing is these ‘funservers’ since it seems ‘RSC-like or low exp rate’ servers can’t seem to match RSCAngel.</p>
<p>This thread isn’t about me spreading the word of RSCA, it’s some incentive to leading you to share/fix/add features/bugs to RSCDaemon and actually improve the minor things. RSCDaemon pretty much has all major aspect inside worth caring about, but really there is so many little things that can distinguish a private server between the official.</p>
<p>ill throw out a few quick ones i could name off the top of my head, but there really is hundreds lying around.</p>
<p>path validations for missiles (ranged/maging through walls etc)<br>
facing NPC’s when talking to them<br>
shared exp when killing monsters<br>
crumble undead, confuse spells<br>
cannons<br>
different sounds when fighting undead/armored NPCs<br>
proper abstracted quests (none of this hardcoded stuff)<br>
player &amp; npc path blocking<br>
better formulas, including equipment stats (weapon aim/magic/prayer) points taken into calculations<br>
shops selling/buying prices to vary depending on stock</p>
<p>then you’ve got NPC/item/object locations that need more added, many more scripted NPC’s ingame to do tasks (potion maker, dye creator that sort of stuff)</p>
<p>All i see is high rate EXP servers/funservers that pretty much favor donators to rule the server. I’ve been around this community a long time and it seems everything is dead.</p>
<p>I’m planning on helping development and the sharing of code by adding a plugin system and a much easier NPC script system to RSCD. Allowing you all to write NPC’s like you would bot scripts, the plugin system would allow me to write say, a cannons class and instead of me writing up a tutorial on where to paste which bits of code, obviously you just throw it in the plugins folder and it’d be plug and play.</p>
<p>That is if anyone is interested, or would use it.</p>

<p>How long has it been since anyone tried to make a server exactly like RSC? Like he said himself, people are making “fun servers”. Being arrogant about it is what people don’t like.</p>

<p>Your a fool if you believe that. Like it’s been stated before, real development goes without showing, especially in this community. When assholes aren’t contradicting/bending the rules to their liking, then maybe perhaps people will feel welcome again.</p>
<p>Until then, you have yourselves and your moderators to blame.</p>

<p>Your a fool if you believe that. Like it’s been stated before, real development goes without showing, especially in this community. When assholes aren’t contradicting/bending the rules to their liking, then maybe perhaps people will feel welcome again.</p>

<p>How long has it been since anyone tried to make a server exactly like RSC? Like he said himself, people are making “fun servers”. Being arrogant about it is what people don’t like.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah jesse, I see where your comming from. Im don’t think that he was trying to do it on purpose? I mean, all the servers we have seen lately fit perfectlly in the “for fun” catagory except for a few.</p>

        <p>xEnt, for me the issue with trying to emulate RSC exactly it that all the players who want that play RSCA and I doubt they’d switch even if I made one exactly like RSC, so I don’t really see a point in wasting that much time to have something that’s going to have like 10 players.</p>
<p>With fun servers more people are switching around due to unstable servers going down, and at least gives a chance to startups, and doesn’t require you to invest nearly as much time into developing it.</p>
<p>ATM I’m working on a fun server (kinda) but it’s going to have components like RSC and some different ones, and maybe once I get it pretty close to RSC and have a decent size playerbase, I might ask the community to vote on if they want it to have the non original rsc parts taken out or kept in.  But I’m not staying with RSCD, I don’t really like it, and I think it’d just be easier to make one from scratch, and make it without bugs from the beginning.  But I don’t have the time right now so I’m going to be using it until I get some free time.</p>
<p>Anyway…  I like the idea of a plugin system, and I think that it’d make the community more involved as a whole in the development.  And most of the stuff on the list looks like it can all be done fairly easily…</p>

<p>I don’t see why people need so much help, I started to get into RSC dev not too long ago, and I didn’t ask for help, it took me like 10-20 mins to have RSCDv25 up and running.  It’s not hard at all, people make it overly complicated and don’t know how to follow instructions and use their brain.  TBH (not trying to be an asshole) if you can’t set it up on your own or figure out simple java errors you shouldn’t be running a server.  You should learn java, then work on servers, not the other way around, because you will write code that is just garbage and it will cause problems in the long run.</p>

<p>look @ this community…</p>
<p>There is flame every other post in every single topic.</p>
<p>The servers have matured a long way in development but hasn’t been the same with the community members.</p>
<p>Starting from frank_'s project which i still have to RSCD v25 the development has grown substantially.</p>
<p>But giving plugins is going to cause more flame. More dude help me set ups. Instead of people taking the time to learn java they try and jump into shit.</p>
<p>But again just my $.02</p>

<p>i was not trying to brag or anything honestly, but from what i’ve seen nothings getting done. If theres an undercover project thats going good, great good for them i’m happy, unlike a lot of others i do actually care about RSC dev and replicating the old original game, it’s nice to see the community help by doing this too.</p>
<p>Nice to see you working on stuff gawdz</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/codeforfame-2.html">@CodeForFame</a> it’s not even just about the players RSCA has, if RSCA was to end today id still develop the server, it’s just easier with couple of hundred to test for bugs and report missing RSC content, which has helped ALOT.</p>
<p>I started trying to replicate RSC from RSCDaemon since it seemed nobody else was doing it, nobody else was even trying and i believe I’ve came a great distance to fill in all the minor features and gaps missing, at least for the F2P part of the game and that’s all that should matter.</p>

<p>Then show it? what’s development if it’s thrown away locked up in a cupboard the whole time. As for the corrupt mods, i don’t see it corrupt, i mean i assume your referring to KO9 and Peeter which both admins of RSCA, somehow trying to run things around here to benefit RSCA? show me something that’s been a bad decision by them, because if removing advertisement for SPK and PP2P (funservers that only care about bringing in a few bucks) was a bad decision, theres perfectly valid reasons for that.</p>

        <p>xEnt is kinda right. All these funservers would be fine if they were to actually developer things that matter also. Changing armour colour, adding shit like clans etc is fine, but it’s not really development. It’s replicating what everyone else has done 12 times.</p>

<p>Changing Pr0jectP2P’s advertisement to RSCA - Go look for yourself if you haven’t already changed it to save yourself.</p>
<p>So if you don’t “see” it, it doesn’t happen, correct? I’m not surprised you didn’t see xEnt doing it.</p>
<p>You want examples?<br>
Like the time I went in RSCA’s topic and got in a discussion with Echo, you, and xEnt. I’m sure you remember it, Peter muted me for speaking what needed to be said.<br>
Another time, when I got on your case about locking some servers topic for that “scam”, but you didn’t lock Pr0jectP2P’s topic for doing the same thing, because you were in fact doing the same thing, so by locking Pr0jectP2P’s topic you would have to lock your own. So what happened? You did nothing about it.<br>
Another example - Right now. I’m willing to bet anything after this post I’m going to receive that annoying PM saying I’ve been muted (for speaking the truth).</p>
<p>Did I say YOU? No, but you lock server topics like crazy, and then you promote RSCA like hell. The fact that Peter begged until he got moderator put RSCA in more promotion. You can do whatever you want to these other server topics, but if it comes to yours, it can never be touched. Promoting RSCA? I think so.</p>
<p>If you can’t even defend yourself from the truth, then sure mute me. All it will do is open other users eyes to see how full of shit you and Peter are.<br>
I’ve already Emailed every administrator about you - What did they do? Nothing, because you have them wrapped around your little finger. There is so much corruption in this community, I don’t even see why ANYONE complains about there is no active development - No one likes to be here.</p>
<p>You can “punish” me all you want. The truth is out there.</p>
