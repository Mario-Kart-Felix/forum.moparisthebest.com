    <title>State of RSC Development</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/state-of-rsc-development/297192</link>
    <description>What&#39;s going on? I&#39;ve been looking around here over the last few months and have seen nothing done. Wheres the servers that try to emulate the good old RSC? if you all seem to think RSCDaemon was already finished then your very wrong.

RSCDaemon has hundreds of little bugs/missing features that i know many of you don&#39;t know about, quite a few of you can fix these bugs probably. All i am seeing is these &#39;funservers&#39; since it seems &#39;RSC-like or low exp rate&#39; servers can&#39;t seem to match RSCAngel.

This thread isn&#39;t about me spreading the word of RSCA, it&#39;s some incentive to leading you to share/fix/add features/bugs to RSCDaemon and actually improve the minor things. RSCDaemon pretty much has all major aspect inside worth caring about, but really there is so many little things that can distinguish a private server between the official.

ill throw out a few quick ones i could name off the top of my head, but there really is hundreds lying around.

path validations for missiles (ranged/maging through walls etc)
facing NPC&#39;s when talking to them
shared exp when killing monsters
crumble undead, confuse spells
cannons
different sounds when fighting undead/armored NPCs
proper abstracted quests (none of this hardcoded stuff)
player &amp; npc path blocking
better formulas, including equipment stats (weapon aim/magic/prayer) points taken into calculations
shops selling/buying prices to vary depending on stock

then you&#39;ve got NPC/item/object locations that need more added, many more scripted NPC&#39;s ingame to do tasks (potion maker, dye creator that sort of stuff)

All i see is high rate EXP servers/funservers that pretty much favor donators to rule the server. I&#39;ve been around this community a long time and it seems everything is dead. 

I&#39;m planning on helping development and the sharing of code by adding a plugin system and a much easier NPC script system to RSCD. Allowing you all to write NPC&#39;s like you would bot scripts, the plugin system would allow me to write say, a cannons class and instead of me writing up a tutorial on where to paste which bits of code, obviously you just throw it in the plugins folder and it&#39;d be plug and play.

That is if anyone is interested, or would use it.</description>

This is about the state of development, not the state of admins abusing, or anything else you’re trying to twist to make people seem like they’re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>It’s not like they stickied an advertisement…  They changed one that was breaking rules, and needed to be blacklisted, which stops people from even seeing the site or related.  They offered an alternative, instead of just leaving it blank, not the best move, but still it’s not like it’s the end of the world.  The thread is also locked, who cares if they have 2 if ones locked, it doesn’t make that big of difference, people who want to play RSCA will play it, they aren’t going to get more members from a locked topic.</p>
<p>So just STFU, and can a staff member just mute this kid, he’s annoying and just causing problems.  And everything he says is just spam/flame and it has no substance.  He’s basically just saying defamatory things trying to cause trouble and make people leave moparscape for no reason.</p>
<p>On topic…  xEnt I think that’s an awesome way to get the community involved, like plugins would do.  The only issue I can think of is people adding a huge delay or something that could be annoying to players, but it would just require you to proofread the script.[/quote]</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, they DEPEND off any released work. So give them that, let xEnt do what he wants, let them leech the code to try it themselves, then ask 100s of questions on getting it running.</p>
<p>Look at EasyRSC, look at how well that turned out. 16-17 pages long worth of questions.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/xent">@xEnt</a>: I’m not trying to attack you honestly, it’s just that i’m trying to make a point. Development needs to stay private, even if it means that no one emulates it the way we want it to.[/quote]</p>
<p>You do realize that the 16-17 pages worth of questions is still more then you’ve ever distributed here? Yeah, it may have brought up a lot of questions… but it also helped a few people, which is all you can go for.</p>
<p>Also, moparscapes only value isn’t in sharing your work… it also includes helping people / answering questions. Obviously not all questions deserve an answer (mainly because they’re not HOW-TO questions but rather “can you do this for me?” questions), but work with what you have. Help people that deserve to be helped or just leave.</p>

<p>As you can see it’s very easy to use, even people with no clue could copy/paste bits of scripts, mix them together to get something properly working. To save time compiling and testing these scripts, you can modify the script at runtime, and test without compiling.</p>
<p>I have a class set up with a bunch of these easy methods ‘SendMessage, Wait, Teleport etc’ anything that would need to be used, will be in there as well as further direct player class support if needed.</p>

<p>This one is written by Ecko.</p>
<p>These are both using the original RSC text exactly, i have about 10 NPC scripts done however i won’t share them all, since they really are not that hard to do, i know you guys would have a ton of fun sharing/writing these, and id have some fun leeching some P2P NPC scripts off you guys if they were good.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/old">@Old</a> School Player: i saw your thread about getting a NPC handler team to write NPCs, was exactly what i was going to suggest, a little ‘script dump/sharing community’ but using these sorts of scripts.</p>

I believe public development is overall greater then private development, if we didnt have a bunch of whatever u call them who cant contribute. We need more public development, when you see that someone has a skill/quest/whatever you might want it and of course you want it better then yours so you advance it farther (competition) Thus overall more advancement and development in rsc . The leak of rscdv25 made this community shit.[/quote]</p>
<p>Most communities support public development of any sort becomes it welcomes everyone who is capable of learning and using their brain. In this case, moparscape does not fall in that category, look at the RS2 section. Anyways, lets get back on topic people already voiced their opinions, as Lothy stated, we are more than welcome to leave the forums, as we surely won’t be missed.</p>
