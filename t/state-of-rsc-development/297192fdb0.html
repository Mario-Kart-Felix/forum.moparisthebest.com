GTFO of this thread and make your own if you want to continue this.  This is about the state of development, not the state of admins abusing, or anything else you’re trying to twist to make people seem like they’re doing something wrong.</p>
<p>It’s not like they stickied an advertisement…  They changed one that was breaking rules, and needed to be blacklisted, which stops people from even seeing the site or related.  They offered an alternative, instead of just leaving it blank, not the best move, but still it’s not like it’s the end of the world.  The thread is also locked, who cares if they have 2 if ones locked, it doesn’t make that big of difference, people who want to play RSCA will play it, they aren’t going to get more members from a locked topic.</p>
<p>So just STFU, and can a staff member just mute this kid, he’s annoying and just causing problems.  And everything he says is just spam/flame and it has no substance.  He’s basically just saying defamatory things trying to cause trouble and make people leave moparscape for no reason.</p>
<p>On topic…  xEnt I think that’s an awesome way to get the community involved, like plugins would do.  The only issue I can think of is people adding a huge delay or something that could be annoying to players, but it would just require you to proofread the script.[/quote]</p>
<p>I can’t be fucked to read all of that - It’s probably just a re-write of everything that was said, and you brown-nosing.</p>

You blamed one of them (xent / ko9 / Pets) for changing it, not a random “somebody”. Don’t accuse people and expect them not to reply to you. Technically speaking, you are assuming as you can’t prove that any of them actually did do it. [/quote]</p>
