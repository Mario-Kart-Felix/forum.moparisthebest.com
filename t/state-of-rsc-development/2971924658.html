<p>Changing google’s advertisement to RSCA. - What?<br>
Muting users for links in posts, but no their friends (you). - We are volunteers, I made sure that when I was approached to be a mod that there would be no required time to spend modding and as such I only punish/mute what I see.<br>
Muting people for speaking the truth. - Examples?<br>
Finding every little ounce of reason to put RSCA ahead of other potential servers. - When have I ever done this? I have never even spoke about RSCA outside of our advertisement thread.<br>
Both of them are hypocrites, as well as you are - I’ll be very happy to explain this one, just tell me. - Good for you, but as per the rules, if you don’t like a moderators decision, contact an admin, do not post about it. I’ve told you several times and I’ll start punishing you for it if you keep ignoring it.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>Changing Pr0jectP2P’s advertisement to RSCA - Go look for yourself if you haven’t already changed it to save yourself.</p>
<p>So if you don’t “see” it, it doesn’t happen, correct? I’m not surprised you didn’t see xEnt doing it.</p>
<p>You want examples?<br>
Like the time I went in RSCA’s topic and got in a discussion with Echo, you, and xEnt. I’m sure you remember it, Peter muted me for speaking what needed to be said.<br>
Another time, when I got on your case about locking some servers topic for that “scam”, but you didn’t lock Pr0jectP2P’s topic for doing the same thing, because you were in fact doing the same thing, so by locking Pr0jectP2P’s topic you would have to lock your own. So what happened? You did nothing about it.<br>
Another example - Right now. I’m willing to bet anything after this post I’m going to receive that annoying PM saying I’ve been muted (for speaking the truth).</p>
<p>Did I say YOU? No, but you lock server topics like crazy, and then you promote RSCA like hell. The fact that Peter begged until he got moderator put RSCA in more promotion. You can do whatever you want to these other server topics, but if it comes to yours, it can never be touched. Promoting RSCA? I think so.</p>
<p>If you can’t even defend yourself from the truth, then sure mute me. All it will do is open other users eyes to see how full of shit you and Peter are.<br>
I’ve already Emailed every administrator about you - What did they do? Nothing, because you have them wrapped around your little finger. There is so much corruption in this community, I don’t even see why ANYONE complains about there is no active development - No one likes to be here.</p>
<p>You can “punish” me all you want. The truth is out there.[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t see the pp2p topic advertising RSCA… Provide the link? If you’re talking about it being banned from mscp: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,392306.msg2923607.html#msg2923607" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,392306.msg2923607.html#msg2923607</a>, why don’t you investigate before jumping to conclusions…</p>
<p>I lock topics like crazy? Again, you’re jumping to conclusions. Last time I checked it didn’t say who locked topics, so you’re just assuming it’s me, gj.</p>
<p>Peeter begged for mod? I don’t think so. He actually declined the first offer.</p>
<p>As for you e-mailing all the administrators about me and them doing nothing, well… That pretty much speaks for itself really, doesn’t it? They’re doing nothing, because you’re a fucking idiot and are talking out of your arsehole without bothering to actually find out the truth. I’ve got the admins around my finger? Ha, nice one… I have spoken to mopar once and Lothy only a handful of times, yet another unfounded accusation.</p>

<p>There’s a difference in developing things to build a community and developing things to better a community. Most of the updates these funservers have are shit like clans that are half-developed and piss poorly thought out (No, I’m not pointing at anyone specific).</p>
<p>One of the major difference between RSCA and other servers is the fact that we have A LOT of administrative functions for both administrators and moderators. Most servers have an administrator that actually can do something and a shitload of administrators/moderators that don’t do jack mainly because a) they don’t know how to and b) they don’t have the right privileges.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to say is work on bettering your community from the start. Don’t work on building one and then work on making it better.</p>

<p>But like what most major software developers do is make an ok product, to build a user base, and get it out there, then fix the minor bugs and make the software better after they have it out there.  If they were to make it completely bug free and perfect before release it would be outdated by the time it’s done.  I’m making the things needed for admins and mods to do their job before the server is released, I know what needs to be added and what needs to be done regarding that.  And I already have the staff picked out and ready to start as soon as the server is opened, and I will be personally showing them all how to use the new system.</p>
<p>As for poorly thought out updates, I agree, when I was coding for PP2P I would get the base of something done, and Matt would be like ok it’s done, now send me the code and release it, when it was hardly started.  I did the clan system in about 30 minutes of actual coding, I was planning on making it so you didn’t need to do anything through the website and it would be like the friends list showing clan members that are online and offline, have customizable ranks, ect.  But people running funservers just rush things out with no intent to improve them from just something that is functional.  Which is the main issue with the current funservers.</p>

<p>Your a fool if you believe that. Like it’s been stated before, real development goes without showing, especially in this community. When assholes aren’t contradicting/bending the rules to their liking, then maybe perhaps people will feel welcome again.</p>
<p>Until then, you have yourselves and your moderators to blame.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Then show it? what’s development if it’s thrown away locked up in a cupboard the whole time. As for the corrupt mods, i don’t see it corrupt, i mean i assume your referring to KO9 and Peeter which both admins of RSCA, somehow trying to run things around here to benefit RSCA? show me something that’s been a bad decision by them, because if removing advertisement for SPK and PP2P (funservers that only care about bringing in a few bucks) was a bad decision, theres perfectly valid reasons for that.[/quote]</p>
<p>No point in needing to prove anything to you xEnt. (Evidence)Most of which is probably edited, or deleted anyways. This goes beyond you, KO9 and Peeter, so you’re not all to blame. Need I mention the un-answered topic a while back regarding moparscape’s double standards for promoting communities with malicious attacks. From what I remember, the internet was fair game, whether we can control people’s actions beyond moparscape shouldn’t be up to moparscape admin to judge. I’ll list some examples of biased moderation:</p>
<p>ST0rKPK, because “so&amp;so” attacked a couple servers (including your own), was banned for advertisement. Fair enough.</p>
<p>FusionPK, yet another server who also attacked a couple small servers with the owner !Mew <span class="bbcode-b">admitting</span> to it. What happened? Nothing, I posted proof, a couple others were witnesses/victims, and it was all overlooked then deleted. Hmm, so it’s ok to attack small servers but its NOT ok to attack RSCA or Moparscape.</p>
<p>Pr0jP2P, yes we all knew this was inevitable to happen. The minute lothy edited the topic to advertise to RSCA instead, is where he took it too far. I’m not saying your to blame for this, but it’s bullshit like this that piss people off. It’s unfair to other servers who probably do try to get members legitimately.</p>
<p>Development should die, no one here deserves it as far as Moparscape is run the way it is. I can speak for a couple low key developers to say that either the rules change, or you’ll find yourself flooded with 100 line C&amp;P tutorials on how to compile a destroyed piece of code, because the reality of it is, it’ll end up that way.</p>

        <p>Hi, glad to see that this thread can hopefully recover from any attempted derailing.</p>
<p>As KO9 has stated (and displayed with that image) it was in fact me who vandalised both the account of the guy who runs the specified server and his topic.<br>
I did it, frankly, for a bit of humour at the guy’s expense. I apologise if my brand of humour wasn’t as entertaining as I thought it would be.</p>
<p>Now I’ll dispell a few more rumours.<br>
Firstly, none of the staff asked for positions; they certainly didn’t beg, either.<br>
KO9, xEnt, Vrunk and Peeter were all handpicked by myself.<br>
Peeter did in fact turn down the position on several occasions.<br>
Finally, as stated, my correspondence with KO9 has in fact been minimal. I have had even less to do with Peeter/Vrunk/xEnt as far as moderation-related messages go.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short though, I’m going to be blunt and just get to the point.<br>
Jessekinss, you don’t have to use this site. By all means leave; I can assure you that we won’t miss your presence.</p>
<p>Any further bypassing of censored words/names will be punished, so just don’t do it.</p>
<p>Now, back on topic.<br>
With regards to development it would be really nice to have a server that was properly multithreaded. Graham is working on an RS2 version that has quite a good thread model which could easily be adapted to RSC. Obviously the point of this would be to better utilise hardware resources.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:33, topic:297192”]As KO9 has stated (and displayed with that image) it was in fact me who vandalised both the account of the guy who runs the specified server and his topic.<br>
I did it, frankly, for a bit of humour at the guy’s expense. I apologise if my brand of humour wasn’t as entertaining as I thought it would be.[/quote]<br>
So as long as you can get a laugh out of it, you can break your own rules, correct?</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:33, topic:297192”]Firstly, none of the staff asked for positions; they certainly didn’t beg, either.<br>
KO9, xEnt, Vrunk and Peeter were all handpicked by myself.<br>
Peeter did in fact turn down the position on several occasions.<br>
Finally, as stated, my correspondence with KO9 has in fact been minimal. I have had even less to do with Peeter/Vrunk/xEnt as far as moderation-related messages go.[/quote]</p>
<p>Hiring 2 out of 3 moderators that ran a server was a good idea to you? Guess not, look what’s happening.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:33, topic:297192”]To cut a long story short though, I’m going to be blunt and just get to the point.<br>
Jessekinss, you don’t have to use this site. By all means leave; I can assure you that we won’t miss your presence.[/quote]</p>
<p>I can’t say I would miss theirs either, especially all of this abusing, double standard, etc. You break your own rules, defend your moderators without even checking into it, and tell me to leave. BOY you are one good administrator kid. I envy you so much.</p>

<p>Again like I said to KO9, mute me for speaking the truth. I even Emailed you about it a while ago, what did you do? Ignore it. I even went out of my way to PM you to say I Emailed you, you again ignored it.</p>
<p>Do you want to know why you get no respect? Because you don’t deserve any.</p>

        <p>Jessekinss, why are you so stubborn and immature? You repeat yourself over and over with your childish saying, “mute me for speaking the truth”.  What truth are you talking about? When i posted to get Matt’s server removed here, i saw how unbiased and mature the mods here are. Ko9 said over and over that he won’t do anything about it because pictures aren’t enough proof, and that he wanted to stay out of it because he didn’t know anything about what was going on.  It seems you cannot accept the fact that you cannot always get your own way in life.  You aren’t contributing in any way to these forums.  RSCA is the most advanced and well-operated server out.  No, this is not an unbiased opinion, i have played all the rsc servers.</p>

<p>Keep brown-nosing KO9.</p>
<p>My guess is that you’re too stubborn to read what I’ve said. And also I guess that since you don’t see it, it doesn’t happen, like KO9, correct?<br>
He knew exactly what was going on - You on the other hand, do not.</p>
<p>“you cannot accept the fact that you cannot always get your own way in life”</p>
<p>LMFAO. Do you know me? Do you have any idea who I am? Do you know one thing about me, 1 fact without guessing? In no way have I tried to get my way - All I’ve been doing is trolling KO9 into doing his job. Where do you get that sentence from just trolling?</p>
<p>Pure idiocy. simply retarded.</p>
<p>Usually I wouldn’t respond to someone who doesn’t pertain to the subject/argument, but the brown nosing has to stop.</p>

        <p>Jesse don’t bother arguing with them, it’s quite obvious who they’re going to side with.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, they DEPEND off any released work. So give them that, let xEnt do what he wants, let them leech the code to try it themselves, then ask 100s of questions on getting it running.</p>
<p>Look at EasyRSC, look at how well that turned out. 16-17 pages long worth of questions.</p>
