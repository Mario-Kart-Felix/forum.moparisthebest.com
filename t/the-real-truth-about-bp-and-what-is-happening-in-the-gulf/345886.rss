What I don’t understand is, it isn’t that hard to prevent the spreading of the oil, is it?</p>
<p>Oil floats on water, right? Therefore, encircling an area around the leak with floating ‘walls’ should keep the oil in its place, and would allow them to skim it off. I’m obviously missing something, but what?<br>

They already did that, then they found out that some oil isn’t floating.[/quote]That is a lie, they are adding a chemical to make the oil ball up and become clumps. AKA sinking to the bottom.</p>

The ways in which conspiracys are able to be acceptable, believable and available shows more that they exist as an integrated part of the whole, therefore the real conspiracy lies everywhere in the everyday actions of all of us, for better or worse.</p>
