    <title>Making it snow..?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-it-snow/162012</link>
    <description>    Mkay I remember some old servers that use to have weather changes... Well I was thinking it&#39;d be nice to spread a little christmas spirit as we count down the days until most of us get out of school, colledge, work, ect. How would I perhaps , change the weather to snowing screen? I know it&#39;s 100% possible but where would I do what :$. It might lagg so I gotta test try it though :(

<li>In your source folder go to the data folder then Weather.java</li>
<li>Theres no Christmas spirit in it</li>
<li>Its very annoying to players because its hard to see</li>
<li>Great chance of it lagging your server</li>
