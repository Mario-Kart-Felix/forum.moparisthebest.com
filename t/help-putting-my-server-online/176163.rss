    <title>HELP! Putting my server online</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-putting-my-server-online/176163</link>
    <description>Well the title says it all, but heres the problem. Yes, i have had a server before, so I know how to do it. But I create the server, have a no-ip, but my server isnt recongnizing the no-ip, or at least reacting to it. I have both running, but i cant use the no-ip to put it online. What am I doing wrong? :confused:</description>
