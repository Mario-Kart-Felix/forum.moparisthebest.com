    <title>[718] Client stuck at getting updates?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-client-stuck-at-getting-updates/450066</link>
    <description>My friend gave me his 718 server, and I asked if I could use it.
I changed all his IP stuff to my IP&#39;s.. I tried all of the following
No-ip, my real IP, and my localhost IP, and NONE of them worked, when I ran the client, it just stayed at &quot;Checking for updates 0%&quot;

I also get this in the command prompt when I run the client
&quot;error_game_js5connect&quot;

Can somebody please help me out here!</description>

              <p>It’s because your client isn’t connecting to your server. Perhaps your Server is offline.</p>
