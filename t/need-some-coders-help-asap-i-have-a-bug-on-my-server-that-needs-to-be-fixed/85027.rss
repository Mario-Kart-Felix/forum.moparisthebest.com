    <title>Need some coders help! ASAP! I have a bug on my server that needs to be fixed!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-coders-help-asap-i-have-a-bug-on-my-server-that-needs-to-be-fixed/85027</link>
    <description>everytime I kill somone on my server, they pop up in the spot where they died.
And on there computer it shows that they poped up in east varrock bank? 
And if they move towards me, it looks like they are nocliping and they go past the dummy house..... 
its wierd. 
also when I die, it logs me out?

I have been looking in the tut section for this but i cant find it?

Can any of you coders help?   :o</description>

              <p>it’s your server lol, it’s normal happens to me<br>
just go to quests menu and click invisible armour<br>
that’ll work<br>
as of logging out after dieing, just get used to it:]<br>
(if you’re randomly getting attacked by nothing, click invisble armour quest, basically “updates” your screen)</p>
