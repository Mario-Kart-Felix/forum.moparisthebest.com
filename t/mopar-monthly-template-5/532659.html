<h1>The Mopar Monthly</h1>
<h2>#<span class="hashtag">#Edition</span> 5</h2>
<p>This month on the Mopar Monthly:<br>
Welcome to the fifth edition of the Mopar Monthly! For those of you who don’t know what this is, the Mopar Monthly is a monthly magazine where users can see the best of the best in the forums for each month, user interviews, rants, and more! Forum members are free to submit controversial news articles, thought-provoking rants, and anything else by contacting any members of the Mopar Monthly team. For those of you that read the previous edition and provided feedback, a big thanks to you all for keeping this possible!</p>
<p>###<span class="hashtag">#Included</span> in this edition will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Overall Most Helpful Member(s) of the Month</li>
<li>Notable Developments</li>
<li>Hot Suggestion Topics</li>
<li>A Submission From Sk8rdude461</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we begin, it’s only right to announce, for those who haven’t seen it already, that MoparScape now has begun development for its official community server. The project, being developed mainly by Sinisoul and Davidi2, has made good progress since its birth. If you’d like to visit the project thread, <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,651901.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">click me</a>, and if you’d like to join the IRC channel, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/irc.php?img=0&amp;host=irc.moparisthebest.com&amp;channel=mopardev" rel="nofollow noopener">click me</a>, or join <span class="hashtag">#mopardev</span> on irc.moparisthebest.xxx<br>
The server is a community project, and that means that anyone can contribute and develop content for the game. The scripting language is Ruby utilizing jRuby. If you have any interest in developing for the server, you should learn the basics of Ruby. This means outside of the server core, no content will be written in Java. You can probably learn Ruby well-enough in a few days if you study existing examples and have some previous programming experience at all. The server’s github can be found <a href="https://github.com/Hadyn/rune-emu" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>####<span class="hashtag">#Section</span> 1: The Overall Most Helpful Member(s) of the Month:</p>
<p>This category is for users who are willing to help people in need of help. This award doesn’t mean that these users know everything - they may also need help from time to time - but they’re always willing to give up some of their time to help someone who needs it. Users have been listed depending on which section they have the most influence in.</p>

<em>RSPS: My Viewpoint:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I’ve been in the RSPS scene for a good while now, since I was about 12 or 13. In that time, I’ve picked up a vast amount of knowledge, ranging from how to make a simple HTML document, to writing full Java apps to do miscellaneous things. The sad thing is, I never moved on from that simple 317 server. You know, the ones that used to be wildly popular, and everyone in the world plus their parents owned. Yeah, I can’t exactly say why I haven’t moved on, perhaps it’s because I’m just not comfortable enough to do so. And I’m not comfortable enough because I don’t know enough about Java, and you know what, it’s good I haven’t. Why? Because the servers that are being released now (700+‘s) don’t have documentation like a 317. The 317 server isn’t even fully documented and yet we’re moving on to higher revisions. If we can’t even perfect something JaGeX made YEARS ago, why are we working on something they just barely put out? I can tell you why. The people that are just getting into the RSPS scene aren’t in it for the reasons I, or many of you others joined. The top 2 reasons they’re in it are because A) they want to make a quick buck and B) they want to relive the old days. They aren’t getting into it for reasons like I did, and most of you. I saw the game, and I saw it lacked potential. It was missing user creativity. RSPS’ allowed me to essentially make RuneScape in my own image. In life, you never want to do something for the wrong reason. Like school, for instance. Most of us will sit there day by day, bored out of our minds, just waiting for it to end. But if school revolved around you, and what you wanted to do, you’d want be there everyday, on time, and ready to learn. That’s what I’m doing with my RSPS. I’m making it to my liking. Not the general public’s, not some companies, not some other person, and definitely not the individuals on MoparScape. If someone doesn’t like my server, they can gladly leave. The server is for my enjoyment, not yours. Anyways, on the topic of 317s. I believe everyone that goes into RSPS should start on an easy revision/base, and take some form of a course of Java and HTML. If they like what they worked on with those courses, then they’ll like RSPS; because RSPS isn’t about the visuals, it’s about the code behind it. The gears to make the clock move, the engine to move the car. As I end my statement, I just want to restate one simple point: Do not get into RSPS or writing code for the wrong reasons! Make sure it’s something you want to do before you pursue it.</p>

<p>####<span class="hashtag">#Section</span> 6: An Interview With a Forum User</p>
<p>Due to me being extremely busy from school and soccer committments, the Interview will be coming in a following sub-edition.</p>
