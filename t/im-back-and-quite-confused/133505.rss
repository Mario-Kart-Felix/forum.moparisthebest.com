    <title>Im back and quite confused</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-back-and-quite-confused/133505</link>
    <description>School is starting in a few weeks, and I am going to take JAVA, Even though I already know it for the most part, I want to to be a snap. So I am back to private servers.

So my question is, what exactly happened while I was gone?, I see alot of changes have happened


And what source should I download to start working on? I deleted all my old sources\, and I see the ones I did use arent used anymore, so What should I work on?


PS: I am going to try and program Clan Chat, I have it all planned out in pseudocode, Just need to write it in JAVA, (It will consists of commands such as ::joinchat ROOMNAME, ::regchat ROOMNAME, ::chat MESSAGE, ::rank USER, ACCESS, and then some admin settings.
When some 1 registers a chat room, will create a file in a chat/ folder. with all the settings, users/ranks, etc.

I am just confusing on how to display messages, but I can view how the ::say works and create a new one and hopefully find a way to change color of it.</description>
