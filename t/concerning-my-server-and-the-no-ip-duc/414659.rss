    <title>Concerning my server and the no-ip duc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/concerning-my-server-and-the-no-ip-duc/414659</link>
    <description>Okay so I have successfully (or so i think) portforwarded and i can log into my server with the no-ip address, but when my friend trys to log in it gives him an error. I tested to see and it did in fact give an error, my brothers laptop got in tho. (assuming its local network only right now)

so my question is, how would i allow others (not only local) log into the server. (my ports are open, and i can log in through the no-ip address [servername.no-ip.biz]

My regards,

Elegance

              <p>google port checker 43594 im guessing check if its open. im guessing its not, if it gets correctly portforwarded you have to connect with 127.0.0.1</p>
