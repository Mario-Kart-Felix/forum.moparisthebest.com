    <title>[Java] Screener Screenshot Util</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-screener-screenshot-util/509292</link>
    <description>Well for some reason after installing LXDE on lUbuntu my screenshot utilities are broken and not saving any files, even though I can clearly see the screen flash white. Before you say it, i&#39;ve checked &quot;~/&quot;, &quot;~/Pictures&quot;, my desktop, and even &quot;/root/&quot; just to be sure. I cant seem to find them. Anyways, there is no GUI, its just a simple double click, and wait for the file in your home dir.

Before you say &#39;horrible code&#39;, this is all bits and pieces of what I found on google until it made a working result.

			Date date = new Date();
			String dateString = dateFormat.format(date);
			String fileName = System.getProperty(&quot;user.home&quot;) + &quot;/screenshot &quot; + dateString + &quot;.png&quot;;
			System.out.println(fileName);
			File outputFile = new File(fileName);
			System.out.println(outputFile.getName());

				outputFile.createNewFile();
			}

              <p>[quote=“Fat Cookies, post:3, topic:509292”]Any decent desktop environment will allow you to set commands to a key combination. You can just set the “Prt Sc” button to execute “scrot” every time you press it. Must be a way to do this with LXDE.</p>
<p>For example you could make Prt Sc do this:</p>
<p>echo somedir/<code>date "+%Y%m%d%H%M%S"</code>.png | scrot[/quote]<br>
I tried scrot, several packages. The problem was not getting them to take the screenshot. The problem is they are not saving in any directory that I can find. I’m not sure why im getting the issue I am but thats how its happening.</p>
<p>[quote=“Whackatre, post:2, topic:509292”]<code>sudo apt-get install shutter</code></p>
<p>or scrot for a cli interface (i’m assuming you want functionality and that you didn’t build this purely for educational purposes).</p>
<p>why did you even think the screenshot would’ve been saved in /root? i really hope you’re not running as root (doesn’t *buntu disallow that by default anyway?)[/quote]<br>
Because I wanted to check anywhere just to be sure. I’m not running as root, I just wanted to make sure the bash script was not being ran as root since it was being executed via PrtScr button hook in OpenBox.</p>
<p>Its like I said, I’ve investigated the issue and went through several threads on the Ubuntu forums, many results that came up on Google. Nothing was fixing the issue. Scrot, a package called ‘imagemagick’ even had a command in it that I tried. Everything came up with the issue of not giving me a saved image. Scrot only worked if I typed in the command, but only if I didn’t use ‘-window’ and chose the area.</p>

<p>Yea, Ubuntu makes you normal user unless you use sudo.</p>
