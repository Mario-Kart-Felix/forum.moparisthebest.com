    <description>[u][b]Question:[/b][/u] Are there any commands to make a normal Player into a npc?

[u][b]Rephrase:[/b][/u] I am not talking about having a normal player being able to do ::pnpc. I am asking that if an Player Moderator, Admin, or Owner can transform another player into an npc. If there is not, would there be any codes to enable this command?</description>
