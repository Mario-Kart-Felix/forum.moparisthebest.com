He broke 2 rules here, and therefor does not deserve help.  Btw, not all servers have “healtimer”.  It’s just an int added by some nub, and then you downloaded his source.  (then again, there all based of figment now)</p>

<p>I think I might have it a little bit, im trying to do the same thing, but for just a really super basic one, just<br>
search for the food you want, and once you get to something that says like case: 385 its supposed to say<br>
like “healtimer” = 0, change the 0 to a 1.<br>
It doesnt work really good, i just randomly tried it, its OK.</p>
