    <description>Hey guys, is anybody here experienced with InsidiaX? Well I&#39;m messing around on the InsidiaX client, and I&#39;m trying to make the cachedownloader work, but I&#39;m having issues, so can anybody help, it&#39;s just a list of issues I&#39;m sure any experienced coder can figure out so could somebody teamview me? That&#39;d be great, the issues are like, my cache won&#39;t unzip and yeah that&#39;s pretty much it I think.</description>
