    <title>[REQ]Resistance Fall of Man banner</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-resistance-fall-of-man-banner/125762</link>
    <description>I need a banner that is as wide as an A4 page and not too tall, probably bout twice as tall as the Mopar banner I need it to have Resistance: Fall of Man written acorss the banner in a cool font, perhaps on one side you could have a human and on the other a chimera or something. It has to look professional so i came here i can&#39;t do graphics for my life :D</description>
