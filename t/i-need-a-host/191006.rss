    <title>I need a host!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-host/191006</link>
    <description> I am very excited about starting my own private server, but my comp is old and has firewall passwords for ports and port forwarding that i don&#39;t know. If you helped i would give you the title of creator and i would just be co creator. I&#39;m hoping to have different servers.
 

also, suggestions for what to have would be nice....

i know, i just made this account, but I&#39;ve been coding for a while[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 19, 2008, 11:08:34 PM[/size][hr]...............</description>
