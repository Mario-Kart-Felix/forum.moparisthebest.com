    <title>Server like OLD OLD School Runescape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-like-old-old-school-runescape/232277</link>
    <description>I mean when you could pick adventurer, wizard, whatever, and you can pk anywhere.  Are there any servers that are set up like this?  I&#39;ve searched for awhile and haven&#39;t found anything.  Perhaps it was attempted in the past and it didn&#39;t work out too well?</description>

i didnt mean making a server using the old client, i ment just adding that old feature into a 202 client for rscd, or demonik<br>
and server<br>
i just always like that you could select a class like that so i figured i would add it into a server im slowing making</p>
<p>i have 106, and 127 the oldest 2 i have<br>
i took it right from the 106 client and converted for the rscd client</p>
<p>in short just taking old feature and updating it</p>
<p>[quote=“Ian, post:33, topic:232277”]i just came across this on a runescape classic fact sheet</p>
<p>Part one: Choose a character class.</p>
<p>The classes you can choose from are:</p>
<p>• Warrior - Warriors start out with a bronze short sword and wooden shield. They also have 3 attack, defence, and strength. If you start out with this class, you will also start with 12 hitpoints.<br>
• Wizard - Wizards start out with a staff and a blue wizards hat. Their stats are 1 attack, defence, and strength with 10 hitpoints. You will also start with +6 Goodmagic.<br>
• Adventurer - Adventurers start out with 11 hitpoints with 1 attack, defence, and strength. When you start, you will also get a bronze axe(hatchet), jug, pot, and tinderbox.<br>
• Necormancer - Rangers start with 10 hitpoints, a staff, and black wizards hat. They also have 1 attack, defense, and strength.  • Ranger - Rangers start out with a shortbow and 10 arrows. They also have 12 hitpoints, 1 attack, defense, and strength level.[/quote]<br>

<li>Necromancer (Eventually became Wizard. This focused on Magic, since Necromancy was the original Magic) - Started out with a black wizard hat and a regular staff.

<li>Warrior (melee combat skills) - Started out with a bronze short sword and wooden shield.</li>
<li>Miner (mining) - Started out with a pick-axe, which at that time was the only type available. These were later turned into bronze pickaxes.</li>
<li>Adventurer (well rounded) - Started out with a bronze axe, tinderbox, and one piece of cooked meat.</li>
