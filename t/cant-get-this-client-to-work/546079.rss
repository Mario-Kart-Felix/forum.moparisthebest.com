    <title>Cant get this client to work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-this-client-to-work/546079</link>
    <description>when i load this client on my server ip : fallen-fatalityrsps.no-ip.biz it gives me the error_game_js5connect, but when i use it on local host or 127.0.0.1, It works. How can i fix this so it works on my ip so others can use the client instead of just me, and once i get this to work ima Jar it.

Please no learn to do it yourself, i havent messed with RSPS&#39;s for about 4-5 years so if u know a fix id appreciate it if u helped me, thanks.</description>

              <p>that error is saying that it doesn’t not recognize that ip or the ip being used is not online for it to be connected to. You probably did not portforward correctly</p>
