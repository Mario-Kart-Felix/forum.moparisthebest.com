    <description>Hello guys, I hope I am posting this under the right forum section. Basically, I use to code back in the day and have forgotten a lot. I am trying to look for a 317 source and client that is fully working (items, skills, npcs) that I can literally just run on my PC and then connect using the client (127.0.0.1). Sadly most of the download links for any sources/ clients are expired and or not working so if someone could help me out it is much appreciated.</description>
