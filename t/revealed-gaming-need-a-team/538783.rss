    <title>Revealed-Gaming: Need a Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/revealed-gaming-need-a-team/538783</link>
    <description>Revealed-Gaming is a Runescape Private Server aimed at entertainment. Made by players, for players. Revealed-Gaming aims to capture a flawless gameplay experience for it&#39;s players with features that the community wants.

We are dedicated to providing the ultimate gaming experience for every single player, and we will not rest until we have achieved the ultimate level of performance.

With this in mind, please take into account that we are a very dedicated staff team, only who&#39;s only focus is on improving upon something that is already great.

After the previous release of the server, we decided we needed to take a step back in the development process, to perfect the server in which 30+ players online at all times, have come to know and love.

We are currently looking for BETA TESTERS, as well as DEVELOPERS for our second release, and we know that it&#39;s going to be a hit!

We started the server with an edited version of the Krithium base (Divine Fate - 317 Project Insanity), and stabilized the engine. We were running 30+ online, with an engine load of 1%, peaking at a player count of 63 players online at one time (engine load 2.1%), in less than a month! Our development team has worked long, tedious, and difficult hours to remove all known dupes, bugs, and glitches that we&#39;ve face, and we are looking for a few more team members to help us achieve the highest level of player satisfaction possible.

We are currently running the server on a dedicated VPS, with DDOS protection, providing the utmost stability possible.

We also have a professional website set up, that will give the newest of players a great idea of how the server will play.

As I said, I am currently looking for DEVELOPERS (0/1-2), as well as BETA TESTERS (0/1-4). All of our Beta players will receive special perks upon server release, to be determined at a later date.


If you would like to contact me, please feel free to add my SKYPE: &#39;jordan321321321&#39;

PLEASE, SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY, as I do not have time for childish games, and jokes.

<p>Well, I’ve been the only developer for the entire history of the server, and I don’t know how to do everything. ^.^</p>
<p>And no it’s not false advertising. Last time we ran the server, it was hosted on a laptop, providing obviously very shitty hosting. I am trying to do it the right way this time, so I invested quite a bit of money to make sure that the server is as stable as possible.</p>
