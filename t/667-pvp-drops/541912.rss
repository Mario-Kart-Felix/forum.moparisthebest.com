    <description>So basically, I want to make it so that when you kill someone in the wildy, you get a pkp (mine are snowballs, that stack. 22989 is the code.
This is the code i have right now in my player.java

[code]
	public void sendItemsOnDeath(Player killer) {

//	if(killer.getInventory().getFreeSlots() &lt; 1)
//	return;
//	else
//	killer.inventory.addItem(22989, 1);	[/code]

Right now it is //&#39;d because it is somewhat glitched.
When you kill someone, you do get a snowball in your inventory... but when you kill that person a second time, it freezes the game. Nobody can move, but you can still switch tabs, type, and talk to other people and stuff.. then when you restart the server and the same person logs in everybody goes invisible and you cannot see anyone or move.
This is what shows up in the run.cmd
&quot;java.lang.NullPointerException&quot;
And it keeps going untill i restart the server, and use the old character file backups for the person who died.
And every time they log in they are in the same spot, then fall down and die, then freeze.

If anyone could help it would help out my server a bunch!</description>
