              <p>I did not write this script, im just useing it. i have figuard alot of things out from trying it over and over again, but it always said failed to compile so i must not be putting the colors in right? and how is your nick different from yuor name? and in the willow script i was useing it said<br>
function GotColor(ColorType: string): Boolean;<br>
begin<br>
case LowerCase(ColorType) of<br>
‘bank’  : Result := (BankColor    &gt; 0);<br>
‘road’  : Result := (RoadColor    &gt; 0);<br>
‘ladder’: Result := (LadderColor  &gt; 0);<br>
‘quest’ : Result := (QuestColor   &gt; 0);<br>
‘farm’  : Result := (FarmingColor &gt; 0);<br>
so i filled the colros out but it didn’t ask for the colors of the trees. and i dont know what he means buy ladder? where is there a ladder in draynor bank<br>
and bellow this later on it would say<br>
if(QuestColor = 0)then<br>
QuestColor := SLGetSymbol(ax, ay, ‘quest’);<br>
so do i have to put the number in quest sing again? and it would also say<br>
if(BarColor = 0)then<br>
BarColor := SLGetSyimbol(ax, ay, ‘bar’);<br>
if(BarColor &lt;&gt; 0)then<br>
if FindColor(ax, ay, BarColor, MMX1, MMY1, MMX2, MMY2) then<br>
so do i have to put the color fo the bar in to? this is willow whacker script made by Lorax and Similion it says it’s an auto picker but i know that runescape switches the colors so u have to reset colors each time yuo relog back in. please help.</p>

              <p>I really would try something less advanced with your scripting skills, not to be blunt or anything. For DTM’s and or bitmaps look in the tut section, there are some great tutorials on them. And also, get familiar with SRL and its procedures. Use its manual.</p>
