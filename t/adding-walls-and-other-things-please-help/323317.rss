    <title>Adding walls and other things (please help)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-walls-and-other-things-please-help/323317</link>
    <description>I want to add some walls and other things to my server.

How would I add them all client sided so it would make less lagg? I really don&#39;t like having to wait like 5 seconds each login or teleport waiting for the objects to load.

and what are the id&#39;s for walls? I can&#39;t seem to get the right ones, are they even considered objects?

Please help, I would really appreciate it!</description>
