    <description>Just downloaded it and watched it, and I must say I thought it was very good.

I didn&#39;t have high expectations at the start, but I was pleasantly surprised by the ending.

What did you guys think?</description>

              <p>My review for wanted:</p>
<p>At first when I downloaded this movie, I thought it was slightly far fetched with a little too much course language for my taste. However, as the movie progressed it did indeed become more interesting.<br>
The movie had quite a few twists in it, for example when the assassins had found out that their names were printed out of the loom.<br>
A few cool moves from the movie are the ones where they manage to twist bullets and shoot wings off flies.</p>
<p>7/10</p>
