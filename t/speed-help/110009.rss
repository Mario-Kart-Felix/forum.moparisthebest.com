    <description>I&#39;ve got my own server, so when it&#39;s up I usually have to be on there and administrate. I recently turned my server off and went to another server, just to see what else is available and I noticed that the server was a lot faster than mine, with very little to no lag. I talked to the owner, and asked him why his might be faster. We had the same thing, fr33sc4p3 based servers, cable internet connections, etc. I was just wondering what I could do to make my server faster. My server lags like hell at 8-11 people and crashes at around 12. His server [i]starts[/i] to lag at 44 people and crashes at more.

So, I just wanted to know why my server is slow and what I could do to fix it.[br][size=1]Posted on: June 12, 2007, 06:42:38 PM[/size][hr]8 views and no replies. Come on please I really need some help.</description>
