    <title>Object deletion question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/object-deletion-question/477969</link>
    <description>Can you delete an object that is floating about? Like I deleted the objects below the floating object, for an example a house with a ladder. I deleted the bottom part of the house but when I rotate my camera it shows the top part of the house like at the Grand Tree. Is it possible to delete that top part? I&#39;m using a delta source btw.

EDIT: Also, is it possible to create your own tile? Like your in water and spawn land tile, is that possible? :eek:</description>

              <p>Before I even comment on this I want you to know I don’t do Delta. I also have not that much experience with RSPS.</p>
<p>You should try it regardless of asking me. Worst case scenario it doesn’t work and you can restore it.<br>
I believe theirs a cache editor you can use for that type of thing also.</p>

Programming logic:<br>
If their is something in the programme you are running then their must be a piece of code making it happen. Remove the code and it wont exist [deletion in your case], add it in and it will exist.<br>

You should be deleting walls with delete walls, and deleting objects with delete objects…<br>
And yes, you need to remove the objects that’s on the upper floors.</p>
<p>Okay I understand that. I’m at the “Deletewalls” under the client.java and I deleted the bottom half of this house. But, it still shows the top half when rotating the camera. I am wondering how to delete that top half. Should I just climb the ladder and delete the top half?[/quote]</p>
