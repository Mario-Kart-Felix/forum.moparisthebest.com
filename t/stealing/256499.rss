    <description>Why is theft in the real word considered drastically worse than in the virtual world? for example i know a policeman, he is fairly high up in the police, and yet he has no qualms about the fact that me or his son download music, programs etc for free. Yet when he found out bout my sister(for those of you who dont know she got caught being a thief) he found it insulting to have known her and lets face so do i. But i dont understand why theft of programs over the internet costing serious amounts of cash are considered trivial against someone who just steals from a shop. Anyone know?</description>

<p>No more needs to be said…</p>
<p>Now to continue the point about it being illegal to share files without knowing on limewire or torrents. Ignorance does not stand in a court of law, you cannot just simply say ‘I did not know’ in your defence (unless of course, you tried to steal the moparscape webclient and got sent to page showing a rotating penis). When you download the sharing software it’s in their agreement that the stuff you download is shared with other users, and it’s your responsibility to read that. I hate to keep using analogies, but it’s like signing a contract then breaking it because you didn’t read some of it.</p>
<p>And anyway, how is anyone going to accidentally download pirated software, accidentally use it and burn it to disc, and accidentally share it, even if the link does say Dead Baby Jokes @@ Deluxe Boxset?</p>

<p>If the filename were something such as “my mom playing the piano” or something of the like, not implying that it was a music file of which you downloaded, then you could in fact claim you did not know, just like if the sign that says the speed limit is gone, or unable to be read, you could claim you did not know the speed limit.</p>

<p>There are laws, and you can see a sign. You are supposed to see that sign, you have been taught to. With that sign comes a few laws. You are supposed to know the law. With downloading it’s different. The signs aren’t placed by the authorities, so they aren’t that bonding.</p>

<p>It’s not the same. If I link you to a page called “help with port forwarding” and it has an image on it of a child naked, you downloaded that image. Is it your fault?</p>

              <p>Stealing in the digital world isn’t as bad because you don’t steal something physical, or not something that can become physical. So hacking someones bank account is just as bad as stealing someones money, because the money on your bank account can be made physical. But other then money, digital stuff can’t be made physical.</p>
<p>You type a poem on your laptop, and someone hacks you and copy’s your poem. You don’t lose anything. You still have the poem, but now someone else has it too.</p>
<p>The same applies to you writing down a poem on paper. Someone comes into your office, and writes your poem on another piece of paper that he brought with him, with a pen of his own (just to make sure he won’t be accused of stealing some ink or a piece of paper). You don’t lose anything.</p>
