    <title>War On Humans?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/war-on-humans/326550</link>
    <description>i was reading my university newspaper (purely idiotic newspaper, published for the purpose of nothing).

it&#39;s full of crap (funny stuff i guess), there was this article on &quot;the war on humans&quot; ??

just to phrase it, it started with the rats and the flies, the spread the plague that killed 1/3 of Europe (if i can remember correctly) but superior human genetics fought against it, since then pigs, birds and cows have joined this holy alliance. So what is the fate of humanity as man becomes the prey? and the prey turns predator?</description>

If I were to follow the train of thought provided by the article though, I would think pets starting to disobey their owners, rabies, and livestock spreading disease.</p>
