    <description>[b]I will give whoever helps me Rep++ and a 30 Day RuneScape Membership Card&#39;s PIN Number (But only if the help information recieced works)[/b]

I have a very important question, that must be answered URGENTLY, or the development of my server may not be able to continue. Now, what i&#39;m about to ask you may seem pretty simple to effect an entire server, but let me explain to you how it WILL if the problem doesn&#39;t resolve:

1. This will be used in the beginning stage when a player creates a new account: He/She must complete a quest which then activates the player&#39;s account once complete.

2. It will be used in other quests, or just as an additional help &#39;hint&#39; for other things.

3. It will signal player&#39;s in Wilderness PVP where their attacker is.

4. It will be used in certain minigames, and will also signal player&#39;s where certain NPCs are.

The question is: How do you add the Hint Icon (Yellow Arrow) above an NPC&#39;s head, or over certain coordinates for a 508 server? NOT OVER A PLAYER&#39;S HEAD, but above certain NPC&#39;s/Coordinates! Please this feature is needed in so many updates that I have that it isn&#39;t even funny, but as promised, I will give anybody who helps me Rep++, and the Activation Code that WORKS for 30 days of RuneScape Membership.

IT MUST BE FOR A 508 SERVER- Thanks.</description>
