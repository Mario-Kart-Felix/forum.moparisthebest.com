    <title>Delta Random Logout and RollBack? [PAYING FOR FIX]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-random-logout-and-rollback-paying-for-fix/351620</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m having a problem, players are getting disconnected (like logged out) and their character file rolls back, randomly...

I have an auto save on an event every 5 minutes. It saves when you logout.

I just cant figure out what the problem is, players will randomly log out and it will roll back to a random state....

Like I dropped an item, got logged and it stayed away. 
Got logged out, came back on and it was back a few hours later?!

This problem started happening recently, if anyone can help me fix I will pay, need help immediately!

We can talk on msn!</description>

              <p>go into client.java, server.java and search for disconnect(true);, under that put save(true); so whenever you disconnect it saves.</p>
