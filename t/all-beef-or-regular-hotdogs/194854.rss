              <p>I don’t really care for different types of hot dogs, although I love pigs in a blanket… or pigs in blankets, however you would pluralize that. Also, Davidude put his old signature back! That is nice to see.</p>

              <p>Well I’m not really sure by what you mean regular. Do you mean those stupid ones that come in brine water?</p>
<p>Well I don’t know what you really mean but I do love those random hot dogs they sell at fair grounds that come with fried onions. Those are de-lish.</p>
