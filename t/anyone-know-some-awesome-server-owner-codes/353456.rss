    <title>Anyone know some awesome server Owner codes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-know-some-awesome-server-owner-codes/353456</link>
    <description> Please post them. The full code, and where to put it.   :D
It can be sets of items, emotes, and teleport commands. 
I also would like someone to tell me how to make when I talk, a certain color in the chatbox!  :eek:

Thanks. :|</description>
