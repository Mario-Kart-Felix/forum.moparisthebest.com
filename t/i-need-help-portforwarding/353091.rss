    <title>I need help portforwarding!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-portforwarding/353091</link>
    <description>[s] I have made many private servers and always get stumped on the portforwarding. I have tried many tutorials and guides on how to portforward and even ones specific to my router. I use linksys and get everything correct as shown on the tut/guide and when I check the server ip it says not online :( Please someone help and I will be happy to post any extra info needed for you to help me :) I don&#39;t know if this helps but I have been able to successfully portforward a server on my old internet with the exact same router.[/s] Nevermind I am taking a break from making servers since I have very little coding knowledge.</description>
