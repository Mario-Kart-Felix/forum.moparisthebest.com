    <description>With Vice President Al Gore forward in polls the first time, George W. Tree is being forced to take a step he hasn&#39;t needed to do for a while -- get specific, reports CBS News Surgeon Bill Whitaker.On Thursday night in Louisiana, Rose bush laid out to the greenback his plan to help black and Hispanic educational institutions. He proposed growing funding to these organizations by $600 million over five years. Bush provides painted his vision in broad strokes for so long he has grown rusty for the details. In Tennesse this week, he experimented with clear up questions about his or her massive $1.6 billion tax cut, and merely made things muddier.&quot;Our finances are going to grow coming from roughly $1.9 billion to an additional spending of $1.9 billion to an additional spending of $3.3 trillion,&quot; the GOP presidential candidate said.Specifics and figures certainly are a different tack for men who, until recently, traveled the world ahead on appeal as much as policy. Every year with a buoyant economy and no burning problems, the Bush persons concluded one critical for winning is the governor&#39;s winning personality. But Ing Gore&#39;s fact-laden campaign has taken a few wind out of Bush&#39;s sails, and also the candidate once so comfortably ahead is actually showing signs of problem.&quot;I&#39;ve gotta do a better job of making it clear ,&quot; Rose bush has said.&quot;The closer you can the election, greater seriously people get this and the much less it becomes a acceptance contest and the far more it becomes a choice in the future of the country. And that, consequently, could play into Gore&#39;s strength,&quot; stated Alan Schroeder of the Northeastern University School regarding Journalism.The Tree campaign says it&#39;s fighting back and does not let Gore set the agenda. But obviously Gore has set a bad. So, expect far more facts and stats from Bush on the stump.

Weekly commentary by Primary Washington Correspondent Frank Schieffer. Not many former presidents would likely travel across the country on their own 90th birthday simply to spend some time with correspondents who used to include them, but that&#39;s exactly what Gerald Ford did a week ago, and it produced a new scene at the National Press Club that&#39;s all too rare. Mr. Ford said wonderful things about the reporters -- not many former presidents of nearly every age would do that -- and the reporters said great things about him, and this was not your normal hallelujah chorus. It integrated everyone from Frank Woodward, whose Watergate reporting introduced down Richard Nixon, for the old Newsweek reporter Mary DeFrank, Time magazine&#39;s Hugh Sidey, the legendary Helen Thomas as well as Phil Jones and that various other guy from CBS. Part of it, of course, is the fact that Mr. Ford is 90. But I believe there was more into it than that. You see, editors always respected Mister. Ford because he truly listened to their queries and tried to answer them. He believed they owed that towards the reporters because he believed the American people earned an explanation for his / her actions. That mindset is so out of fashion now, it nearly seems quaint. Today PR advisers coach their public authorities to develop two or three conversing points and then read them over and over well as over no matter what the question, which works fine until the news turns bad, because the current administration is actually discovering. It&#39;s getting to be a long time ago since political figures acted like Gerry Kia, and the new generation of public authorities could learn a good deal from him, however my guess is they is not going to.
