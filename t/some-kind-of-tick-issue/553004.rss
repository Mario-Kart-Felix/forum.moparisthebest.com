    <title>Some kind of &quot;tick&quot; issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-kind-of-tick-issue/553004</link>
    <description>the issue is most apparent when fighting npcs but it is a server wide issue,

it seems every 1min or so the server &quot;ticks&quot; speed up / surge and while killing npcs about 10 hits happen in the space of 1
it is also apparent when mining a shooting star you get about 15 xp drops in the space of one, 

would anyone know where to start looking to fix this</description>

              <p>I would guess your processor cannot keep-up in this time. It does a surge to catch back up after the garbage collector does its duty. As all the server ticks are queued, they are to happen “at or after” a given time.</p>
