    <description>hi there everyone i need a bit of help,

well this is what i got to do before i can put my server online;

1. i need to add commands that work!
2. i need to fix all spell books because they are not reconising water runes
3. i need help on how to add text to an npc so i can talk to it (in the text box. not shouting out loud!)
4. i need to fix the player rights. i have changed my rights to 3 (owner i think) and it doesnt let be do some commands.
5. and i keep on no-clipping through walls when i follow a player!

i would really appreciate it if someone could help me! also you have probably guessed im a newbie to coding so please dont flame me you all was a newbie once!

many thanks
