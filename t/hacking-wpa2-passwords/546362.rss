    <title>Hacking WPA2 Passwords</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hacking-wpa2-passwords/546362</link>
    <description>A very interesting subject. How secure [b]is[/b] WPA2? How long would it take a determined hacker to break down your wireless network? What if the attacker had three high-powered GPU&#39;s working together and a 10-terrabyte set of rainbow tables?

&lt;blockquote&gt;It&#39;s been known for a while that WPA-PSK was vulnerable to brute force attack. Tools like Aircrack and coWPAtty took advantage of this weakness and provided a way to test keys against dictionaries.

Problem is, it&#39;s a very slow process. Each passphrase is hashed 4096 times with SHA-1 and 256 bits of the output is the resulting hash. This is then compared to the hash generated in the initial key exchange. Alot of computing power is required for this.

....

At thier heart, rainbow tables are the embodiment of the Time-Memory trade-off. They are basically a giant version of your grade school multiplication tables. In those tables, given 2 numbers you can quickly lookup the result for that equasion without doing the more complicated math. The trick is that at some point, someone had to invest the time to do the complicated math in order to fill out the table for you to reap the benefit of a quick lookup. This is the heart of the Time-Memory trade off; It is often easier, cheaper, and more effecient to do the calculation once and store the output for later repetative use, than doing the math over each time.

The application of the Time-Memory trade-off is particularly useful in password cracking and cryptography. One of the barriers that cryptography uses is large keys. In order to test every possible key, the attacker faces a huge task that in some cases can take years.

However given the exponential growth of both processing power and storage, it&#39;s concievable that an attacker could invest the time to pre-compute a lookup table for every possible key in advance of the actual attack, and commit that result to some sort of storage. All future attacks now only require a quick lookup in the table and are very close to instant. After investing the initial time to build the table, they no longer have to re-invest that time for subsiquent lookups.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


The issue, of course, is that WPA keys are salted with the SSID and SSID length, you have to precompute the rainbow tables with the SSID, so you can either precompute the rainbow tables for a list of common SSID&#39;s or you&#39;d have to compute new rainbow tables for the SSID  you are attacking. Also, for longer and more complex passwords, it can take a really long time even with rainbow tables.

The ISP at my parent’s house does that, and for at least 2-3 years they used the standard password generating algorithm by the vendor, which was based on the default SSID of the router.<br>
Someone figured that out at some point and actually released <a href="http://www.nickkusters.com/Services/Thomson-SpeedTouch" data-bbcode="true">a tool</a> to get into those routers.<br>
I tried it a couple of years ago and there were some vulrenable routers in the direct area…</p>

True, but the less of a target you are, the less chance you have of getting picked, especially if everyone around you is using the same technology. If you live in that one really big house in the neighborhood, overlooking all the others, chances are you’d be the first choice for somebody driving through trying to get some victims. In naseem’s situation however, he would have to be really unlucky to get picked (essentially) randomly out of all the houses around him, assuming there’s no profilable difference. (Of course one could just drive through and pick off every WiFi connection he gets in range of, in which case it just sucks to be you.)</p>

<p>However,</p>
<p>[quote=“jal knight, post:6, topic:546362”]One cool thing is you don’t have to be in range of the router to crack the WPA2. In fact you could be in a different state ^.^<br>
Like Paul stated in his video, as long as you capture the hashed pw you are good to leave the scene, go home and let the lappy sit and work.[/quote]<br>
if you piss somebody off with the knowledge to do this, and they knew your location, you could have some issues.</p>

<p>If your ISP provides you with a router then it may use a default random password, but it may also use a generic SSID, which would make it more susceptible to rainbow tables. If you had the time and processing power, you could make a rainbow table for all the possible ISP SSID’s, if you had enough of them to make a formula.</p>

</aside>
<p>When you purchase a router(I think it’s still like this…) They don’t come with a default password, until you connect to it.<br>
After you connect to the router you can use default username/passwords which can be found with a Google search. This gives you the ability to change the SSID, security, update the firmware, view logs etc.<br>
If you find yourself needing access to the router itself you can use rainbow tables to crack those.</p>
<p>Before I stopped using Kali I was using the Aircrak-ng suite.  I didn’t really like using the GUI in the above video unless for a WEP but I started becoming more interested in reaper for cracking WPA2.</p>
<p>oh and to add:<br>
One cool thing is you don’t have to be in range of the router to crack the WPA2. In fact you could be in a different state ^.^<br>
Like Paul stated in his video, as long as you capture the hashed pw you are good to leave the scene, go home and let the lappy sit and work.</p>

              <p>Mixing numbers symbols and different case letters would make the password much more difficult to crack, yes.

It might take months, and by that time the user would probably have already change his password.</p>
<p>With WPA Keys the password is Hashed, so it has an irreversible math algorithm run on it. To crack it, you have to basically hash random words (your dictionary list) until one works. The shortcut is a Rainbow Table, which has all the hashes run ahead of time. This is fine, but you have to either hash your whole wordlist for every possible network name (or SSID) ahead of time, or make a custom rainbow table for the network name you are attacking (which may not even be worth it). This is because the SSID or network name is included (or “Salted”) into the hash.</p>
<p>If the target network has a common SSID (Linksys or Netgear for example…) these Rainbow Tables may be very helpful:</p>
<pre><code>7 GB table - 172,000 passphrases against 1000 SSID's
33GB table - 1 million passphrases against 1000 SSID's
</code></pre>

              <blockquote>WPS is a quick-config system that allows you to connect to a router without doing any configuration on the client side. It works by exchanging a pin code that acts as a temporary key, in order to transmit configuration details to the client. Unfortunately, the key is short, and easily brute-forced. The solution is to turn off WPS on your router, which you have done.
<p>As for which method of encryption to use, WPA2-PSK is fine. So far the only attacks against it revolve around brute-forcing weak passwords, so if you’re using a strong password then you should be alright.</p>
<p>The older WPA (WPA1, if you will) has problems that could allow an attacker to break into your WiFi by sending special probes, leading to information disclosure that can be leveraged via a cryptanalytic attack. WEP suffers from similar issues, but is much worse - in general WEP is considered to be about the same as no password at all, in the face of an attacker that knows how to perform basic wireless attacks.</p>
<p>Mixed mode means that both WPA and WPA2 are available, and the client can choose which to use. I’m not sure of the specifics, but I’d guarantee that this is less secure than just running WPA. I think in order to attack it there must be at least one authenticated client attached via WPA, but don’t quote me on that one. The reason this mode exists is to provide compatibility with older devices. For example, a stock firmware Sony PSP doesn’t support WPA2.</p>
<p>WPA-802.1x is another name for WPA-Enterprise, which involves running a RADIUS server inside your network to federate login requests. This uses Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) for the authentication. The primary benefits of RADIUS-based wireless security are that you can choose different credential types for authentication (i.e. you don’t just have one shared key), and that you can prevent brute-forcing of logins. This is a more complex setup, though, and isn’t well-suited to home use.</p>
<p>The last thing to consider is the encryption scheme. The two standards are Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Counter Cipher Mode Protocol (CCMP). The first is based on RC4, and is used by WPA. The second is based on AES, and is much stronger than TKIP, and is the default for WPA2.</p>
</blockquote>(To aid the discussion)
<p>Pretty informative, I never really that deeply about things like this with network security, although recently I have been taking steps to improve my internet anonymity as I haven’t done so as much as I should have.</p>
<p>Also, my knowledge of how encrypting works is poor, so answer this question for me, does mixing numbers, symbols, and different case letters make your password harder to crack rather than just a very long string, like a phrase? I assume yes.</p>

              <p>A very interesting subject. How secure <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> WPA2? How long would it take a determined hacker to break down your wireless network? What if the attacker had three high-powered GPU’s working together and a 10-terrabyte set of rainbow tables?</p>
<blockquote>It's been known for a while that WPA-PSK was vulnerable to brute force attack. Tools like Aircrack and coWPAtty took advantage of this weakness and provided a way to test keys against dictionaries.
<p>Problem is, it’s a very slow process. Each passphrase is hashed 4096 times with SHA-1 and 256 bits of the output is the resulting hash. This is then compared to the hash generated in the initial key exchange. Alot of computing power is required for this.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>At thier heart, rainbow tables are the embodiment of the Time-Memory trade-off. They are basically a giant version of your grade school multiplication tables. In those tables, given 2 numbers you can quickly lookup the result for that equasion without doing the more complicated math. The trick is that at some point, someone had to invest the time to do the complicated math in order to fill out the table for you to reap the benefit of a quick lookup. This is the heart of the Time-Memory trade off; It is often easier, cheaper, and more effecient to do the calculation once and store the output for later repetative use, than doing the math over each time.</p>
<p>The application of the Time-Memory trade-off is particularly useful in password cracking and cryptography. One of the barriers that cryptography uses is large keys. In order to test every possible key, the attacker faces a huge task that in some cases can take years.</p>
<p>However given the exponential growth of both processing power and storage, it’s concievable that an attacker could invest the time to pre-compute a lookup table for every possible key in advance of the actual attack, and commit that result to some sort of storage. All future attacks now only require a quick lookup in the table and are very close to instant. After investing the initial time to build the table, they no longer have to re-invest that time for subsiquent lookups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue, of course, is that WPA keys are salted with the SSID and SSID length, you have to precompute the rainbow tables with the SSID, so you can either precompute the rainbow tables for a list of common SSID’s or you’d have to compute new rainbow tables for the SSID  you are attacking. Also, for longer and more complex passwords, it can take a really long time even with rainbow tables.</p>
