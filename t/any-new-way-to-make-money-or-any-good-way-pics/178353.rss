<p>Exactly, I said nothing about him doing irons. I think he should mage or range steels so that his chance for a visage could increase dramatically.</p>

<p>If I macro the next day my account will be banned, I’m thinking of getting a good 69 levels in fishing and fish sharks.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you haven’t fished sharks before, don’t. They are very slow. If anything, do monkfish (you need to do the Slug Menace quest which is actually a pretty easy quest [if you are a quester]). Monkfish give near the same experience in fishing and cooking as sharks, burn once in a while (I suggest getting the cooking gauntlets from The Family Crest quest as well) and fish nearly as fast as lobsters. They also sell (I believe) 300 or 350 each. It is totally worth it just for the experience as well.</p>
<p>Another good way of making money is doing treasure trails. If you have done the regicide quest and have a decent strength level (and 60+ attack), invest in a dragon halberd and go kill hellhounds near ardougne (I think you need to start the temple of ikov quest first). Otherwise, kill the hellhounds in 50 wilderness (ardougne lever teleport to mage arena). Good luck and happy money making.[/quote]<br>

<p>Why irons? If you are maging or ranging, you do steels. Meleeing is for irons.</p>

<p>Do you think his stats can melee irons?</p>

<p>You sir, have missed my point completely.<br>

</aside>
<p>No I understood your point your point is if you are going to mage or range any metal dragon it should be steel. Iron is for meleeing.</p>

<p>Exactly, I said nothing about him doing irons. I think he should mage or range steels so that his chance for a visage could increase dramatically.</p>

</aside>
<p>If you haven’t fished sharks before, don’t. They are very slow. If anything, do monkfish (you need to do the Slug Menace quest which is actually a pretty easy quest [if you are a quester]). Monkfish give near the same experience in fishing and cooking as sharks, burn once in a while (I suggest getting the cooking gauntlets from The Family Crest quest as well) and fish nearly as fast as lobsters. They also sell (I believe) 300 or 350 each. It is totally worth it just for the experience as well.</p>
<p>Another good way of making money is doing treasure trails. If you have done the regicide quest and have a decent strength level (and 60+ attack), invest in a dragon halberd and go kill hellhounds near ardougne (I think you need to start the temple of ikov quest first). Otherwise, kill the hellhounds in 50 wilderness (ardougne lever teleport to mage arena). Good luck and happy money making.</p>
