    <description>[b]Microsoft Word.[/b]

Hey.  I tried to open this program, and it kept sending me the message, &quot;This modification is not allowed because the document is locked.&quot;  So, I looked around and couldn&#39;t seem to find any way of unlocking it.  I went to help, and read what Microsoft had to say.  Well, they didn&#39;t explain how to unlock the document, put it that way.

So, has anyone got any ideas as to how I can unlock this program?</description>
