    <description>Hi

I have a Server in a Datacenter, it has 3.2GHz Intel Dual Xeon CPU and 480mb RAM.

It has a 100mbps Internet connection (up/down)

but.. When I reach 45+ players - it starts to fail and stops..

Could it be the RAM? Im sure the CPU is fine, its a good high quality one..

How much RAM would you suggest?</description>
