    <title>Suggestions for a straight pk server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestions-for-a-straight-pk-server/338448</link>
    <description>Im not new at java, but I am new here at moparscape.
So ive got a question, if you were to play on a pk server (only a pk area, a market place, and a woodcutting place) that was based at burthope(the game room) and a small portion of the surrounding areas what would you expect out of it, want out of it, and be happy to see and use in it.
I need ideas!
anything from minigames, weapons, shops, and pretty much anything you could think of that youd want in a great pking private server</description>
