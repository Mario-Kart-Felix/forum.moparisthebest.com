    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/waiting-inbetween-actions/447922</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making a fletching class and I have everything down except for how to make it wait after it cuts a log. It just instantly cuts all the logs into bows. Can anyone help me figure out how to make it wait? I know it has something to do with system.currentTimeMillis().

thanks</description>
