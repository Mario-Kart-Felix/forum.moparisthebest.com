<p>Actualy you do. You use the old website of RuneScape (and even the description in google lol). the website is created by Jagex so you offend their rules by using their website. You also use their images on your site saying from where they came from. So tahts annother offend against their rules. BTW did you know that a website verification is only to ensure that the website is secure? So the person who posted you use their copyrighted stuff is completely right</p>
<p>Other than that, nice development and good luck (but i would change your website layout atleast)</p>
