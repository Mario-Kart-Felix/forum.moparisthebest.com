<p>Very well put.  I agree, simply having this certification alone will not get you a job related to java.  It will, however, look impressive to an employer for a job that has nothing to do with Java or even programming for that matter.  And in that case, it would be entirely worthless and have no merit in the eyes of the potential employer.</p>

              <p>The point of the question was not how the number would be formatted, it was about the logic of the ternary operator. I took it from example questions, so its not 100%. Even if it was in a real exam with non float formatting for the number - I would still select that it would return 9 - because that is what they are really looking for.</p>
<p>Regardless, the point was that you people seem to forget what the test even covers. it is MULTIPLE CHOICE questions about the language BASICS. Will this get you a job writing production code, which requires you to design to a degree, debug and write efficent code? No. This piece of paper is akin to a certification in being able to read music. Nothing about being able to play an instrument.</p>

So me being java certified would be extra bragging points, but if you wanted a job in ANYthing to do with computers i can’t see the employer not taking notice and ignoring the fact you’re java certified.</p>
<p>I know if i was employing someone, and 2 people applied and they both had litterly the same qualifications and experience but one of them was Sun java certified i would pick the person who was java certified over the other, and im sure the employer would aswel.</p>

<p>A little ejb work will get you into 175k/year opportunities? Uh huh.</p>
<p>Anyway, if the sun cert was a credit, it would be a rather poor one. It shows no ability to actually do a job successfully.</p>
<h1>Exam type: Multiple choice and drag and drop</h1>
<h1>Number of questions: 72</h1>
<h1>Pass score: 59% (43 of 72 questions)</h1>
<h1>Time limit: 175 minutes</h1>
<p>A multiple choice test. Really.</p>
<p>I think we are discussing the SCJP here, which shows you understand the language (or you do atleast 59% of the time).</p>
<p>An example question:</p>
<blockquote>What results from attempting to compile and run the following code?
<p>public class Ternary</p>
<p>{</p>
<pre><code>        public static void main(String args[])

        {

                    int a = 5;

                    System.out.println("Value is - " + ((a &lt; 5) ? 9.9 : 9));

        }
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>Prints: Value is - 9<br>
Prints: Value is - 5<br>
Compilation error<br>
None of these</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, one question may be entirely about the ternary operator. Wowza.</p>
<p>Scope, inheritance, basic api knowledge and other language features is also tested.</p>
<p>So, how many credits would this count towards a $175k a year job?</p>
<p>Feel free to post his cv with all of his personal details removed aswell, if you wish to support your claim.</p>
<p>Oh btw, the people I know who got “sun certified” did so as they were coming from a c++ background to a java one, its was a piece of paper going “Hey, I can use java now too!”.</p>

<p>If you had no degree but a lot of experience and the certificate, it would help a lot.  But you’ll run into corporate policies where they don’t hire people without degrees, no matter what.  Which is too bad.  I’ve seen many worthless individuals with degrees.  Any moron can get a degree, but it takes a truly intelligent person to know how to use it.</p>

              <p>Its better than nothing ill give you that, but I wouldnt hire someone who had only that anyway. You would be much better off with a portfolio of work and some real experiance.</p>
<p>Anyway, people will not hire you without (as frank put it) “real” qualifications anyway in this day and age. We are passed the era of hobbyists jumping into large corperations. You may be able to freelance without one, or even get into a small development shop at a push but I wouldnt hold your breath.</p>

              <p>I would imagine it helps a lot. But, tbh, my brother trained in the 2003 training course for the A+ cert, and he never took the final test for it. So, now he has to take the 2005 if he wants to be “officially” certified. Anyway, he got a job no problem just by saying he did the courses.</p>
<p>I don’t think there really is any age, as long as you pay the $200.</p>
