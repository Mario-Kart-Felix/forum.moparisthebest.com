    <title>Player XP table</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-xp-table/244587</link>
    <description>Well, I want to customize my own player xp table as they level. Because I checked on runescape and saw a lot of error&#39;s with the xp table.

Anyone know how to change the XP of the players? Like not make your player start off with like 99 hp, but I want to make a custom XP table for leveling.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: November 17, 2008, 06:16:50 am[/size][hr]anyone please??!?!</description>
