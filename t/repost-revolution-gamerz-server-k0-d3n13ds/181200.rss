    <description>Well since I decided I wanted to start a newer more stable server I&#39;ll get rid of my RicScape v3 ( Ric Released it on moparscape ) I have edited a few things and fixed alot of suff, and for some odd reason I&#39;m having trouble running my server so I&#39;m just gunna give it away and start new.

I can&#39;t log onto server &#39;Cries&#39; I dunno why... 

Low post count and rep means nothing I would never do nothing to harm another persons items.

Updates by me....
-New pking spot at pking emote.
-New npc training spot at npc tra emote
-Vengence on npcs deleted ; why?Because when you used it it took 1/2 of a npcs hp each time....
-Removed P hats In Item.java (you may fix if you like.) They were gotten too often from te pk point system by ric..
-Pickpocket only gives 100k now
-Strength cape gives 20+ str bonus, iron gives 200+ bonus for a pure advantage.
-2 Shops at starter point with new items in it.
-the Bandos god sword hits like whip, but all 3 are wielded like 2hs.
-God swords are not cheap.
-Deleted fast training;added 1k xp on each it on npc.
-Added Dragon Arrows
-Added a Ip of a annoying crasher.
-got rid of cheap commands,Holy force,P ring.
-Got rid of healing... Instead it disconnects your client. Because of mass healing. 


Thats pretty much most of em....

Heres the server Download link...

Download 

Removed the characters so less time downloading. have fun.

Reps ok don&#39;t give it if you don&#39;t want.. I just want to see what ppl think.

Creds:

Ric 89% For all hat hard work.
K0 D3ni3d 11% for all the fixing up done.

Ps. Silab client is in the servers folder.
