    <description>Hey guys, my friend pointed out a problem with his client, he can rotate up and down fine and around. But when his camera angle is all the way down and then he tries turning it, his client crashes... Anyone know how to fix this I would much appreciate. Unless this is just his PC or something idk... Mine works perfectly fine though, Thanks!

Here&#39;s it happening:
