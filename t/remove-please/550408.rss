              <p>So, i’d like to go over this with you so you can see what you need to do with a bit of guidance. For explanation purposes i’ve remade your model which you can see here:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/gu8fI/7fc6d048b9.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>On the left you can see a flat view of the axe, when making a weapon you have to design it as it were being used for real. However, you have to keep the poly count to a minimum so it doesn’t get messed up ingame. So when making the model, i scaled down the line between the dark and light material colours so it made a sharp &gt; look. This gives it the edge it would need to cut something, and kill the rat.<br>
Also, when designing this i made only the left half and mirrored it to the right side. This makes it easier to model a piece and keep the wire clean, if you have trouble keeping track of the colour this also helps.<br>
Having the line completely down the middle gives it the 3D look when the edge faces are joined together, you get the lift while keeping the edges sharp. You’ll find this easier with the half modelling, it makes it easier to model and join in the middle later.</p>
<p>Following this, you need to work on colour to make the model pop. You can see here:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/gu909/40fdb79aa6.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>That, however poorly it looks it, makes it look better then the solid colours. You can mix and match the shades and tones to suit the model however you wish, whichever works. On the right side, i’ve put the Mat panel so you could see the shades of each colour. Generally you make between 3-6 of one colour but change the value, so that you get the “shade” look. Then you apply the colours however you think it should look, so that it looks realistic enough. If you have any questions about that, just ask and i’ll try to explain further.</p>
<p>Also, the reason its messed up in Datmaker and ingame is because you have to triangulate the model in meta before saving it. Otherwise meta cant read the faces properly and cuts them in half causing the missing faces issue.</p>
