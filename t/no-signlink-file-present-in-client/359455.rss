    <title>No Signlink file present in client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-signlink-file-present-in-client/359455</link>
    <description>Alright so i am confused. I have been reading guides about how to add a cache downloader to your client/webclient and they all keep referring to a file called [b]Signlink.java[/b] located inside the client folder with all the java files in it or else inside a folder called Sign&gt;Signlink. But, for some odd reason my client does not contain the file [b]Signlink[/b] and i searched everywhere in it.

I am using the [url=http://silabsoft.org/smf/topic/25044-hyperionproject-annihilation-official-release/]Project Annihilation[/url] client which can be directly downloaded [url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=7OTZZRDI]here[/url].

But, my question is how can I add a signlink.java file into my client folder?
If manually adding a signlink file, any changes need made to the other java files?
Perhaps its already there, but has a different name?
Any alternative cache downloader specially made for this?

please help thanks.


EDIT: Someone said that i might be having problems finding the signlink file cause i am using a 459 client and all the tutorials are for like 317.. so does anyone know how to make a cache downloader for my client? or know of any 459 tutorials?</description>

<p>Okay thanks, i would really like a cache downloader for my webclient, so could you follow me through with incorporating a signlink file into my client, as well as what i need to edit in the other java files. Unless there is a alternative method to making a cache downloader that would be easier. There is a direct link to the client in my first post if you would like to look over it. thanks again.</p>
