    <title>Changing the Char Module</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-char-module/537055</link>
    <description>Okay so me and my friend are working on actually creating a game, but we want to start out with a base of RSPS to kinda find are way around and everything. I know a lot of java, but im warming back into it. We are going to start with a 317 and see what we can do. But I am curious and would be very happy if some one would tell me on how to change the Character Module, so we can put are own characters in it. And also were the animation is found that makes the char move and all of that. If you know that would be greatly appreciated, We are making are own graphics i just dont know how to replace the old one</description>

<p>Get tom’s cache editor (google it there’s a billion links) and open your cache to dig around in the models. Or find a tutorial that shows you how to ‘update’ the player model, but use yours instead of theirs.</p>

              <p>I believe all models and anims are cache packed, unless they hardcoded it (Which is stupid imo) and if that’s the case it’d be in the raw folder or something like it in the cache.<br>
Get RSMV to view the models and make sure it’s the char model.</p>
