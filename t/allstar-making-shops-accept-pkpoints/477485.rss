    <title>Allstar Making Shops Accept pkpoints</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allstar-making-shops-accept-pkpoints/477485</link>
    <description>I have a pk point system in place, everything works with it, I&#39;m just wondering how to make the pk point shop I made &quot;From an NPC&quot; accept pk points as the currency. I have tried some tutorials from Other sites, and they all seem to fail. Maybe its because Im using allstar, but I know its possible. Thanks In advance.</description>
