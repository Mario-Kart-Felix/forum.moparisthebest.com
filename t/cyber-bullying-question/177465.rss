              <p>I doubt you will get in trouble for saying “fuck off” because of the freedom of speech. It doesn’t offend them in away but just an aggressive statement with no hurtful feelings to get away. Your friend will most likely not go to court. For threatening phone calls just a restraining order and like a 300$ fee.</p>

              <p>People who are so called “Cyber bullied” should imo gtfo. There is a button somewhere on their computer that easily turns it off.</p>
<p>However if it were to continue to phone calls etc then of course its gotta be reported etc.</p>
<p>The OP of this thread seems like he doesn’t actually have a friend and is infact the one who cyber bullied a girl.</p>

              <p>If you can recall, there was a girl(around 13) who committed suicide because a fake boy told her all this unjust stuff. Now the people who created the fake boy are on trial.<br>
For the phone, they can be taken to court but the outcome would most likely be a restraining order.<br>
For cyber bulling, it depends on what he said really, and I doubt anything can happen to you.</p>
