    <title>FroyoScape is in need of an Animator!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/froyoscape-is-in-need-of-an-animator/481477</link>
    <description>Some may cool us over crowded of staff, others call us a very unique server, and others say my ideas are the worst. But in order to make out creativity reality, we need someone that could animate our custom models (made by amy_webb), and that someone could be [b]YOU[/b]. Here&#39;s how you can apply:

[ol][li]Start by filling in [iurl=#application]the application[/iurl].[/li]
[li]After that, you will be in pending, so if I do not reply right away, that means you are pending.[/li]
[li]If you are accepted, then welcome to out skype group chat! In there, you will meet staff members Sibor, Flame_, ox random xi, and clawz fury. And of course me. Feel free to ask us ANYTHING.[/li][/ol]

[size=18pt]While you are pending...[/size]

[ul][li]you may be PMed by me or amy (as we control the modelling part of FroyoScape).[/li]
[li]you will be pending for about 1 - 3 days.[/li][/ul]

[size=18pt]If you would like to contact the modeller, Amy...[/size]

[ul][li]ask me on skype if you&#39;d like to talk to her. It&#39;s her personal way so I don&#39;t think I will mention this in public.[/li][/ul]


[anchor=application]Here&#39;s the application!
[code=application]
Name:
Age:

[/code]

You [b]MUST[/b] have a skype. This is the team&#39;s main way to communicate.</description>

<p>let’s say in Runescape, the model “Giant Spider”, you won’t be able to use that spider’s animation for any other spider in Runescape, because that animation is specific for that model.</p>
<p>Human models (like the 317 character) are a different story, clearly you’ll be able to transition those animations over because they have similar “frames”</p>

[/quote]Haha, I believe so. Thanks[/quote]</p>
<p>You can use jagex animations for custom npc. Say you make a custom wolf npc. your wolf and a jagex wolf would have the same basic shape and structure, so if you animate your wolf with the same Tskin, Vskin, and PRI as a jagex wolf and use the correct animation id your wolf will be animated. This will work for any npc too.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Creating animation wasn’t the point of the topic, i believe it was to find someone who is able to animate models with current animations. As modelling a model (and doing a good job of it) takes anywhere from half an hour up, i don’t think an hour or more of animation is a hard price to pay.</p>
<p>Still looking for people who may be interested, we’d also like to see work you have done if you would like to apply. No pressure. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Elve is right, I used to do it over 3 years ago now, and I remember animating a banana man (literally a giant banana with legs), just to walk, and even that took a good hour, way too much for such a simple model.</p>
