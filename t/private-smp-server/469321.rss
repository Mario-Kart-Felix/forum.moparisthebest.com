    <title>Private SMP Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/private-smp-server/469321</link>
    <description>This server is a private survival server put together for myself and some friends to play, unfortunately we are usually too busy to play, and I hate to see the server just sit there.

It is a lag free dedicated Minecraft server, which I host and mange. I have decided to allow others to come and join the server, hoping to get some life back into the world. The server is a solely in survivor mode. 

Currently I only have 15 slots available, which I will expand if the server gets more visitors. 
I try to keep the server up to date, and I used have it running 24/7 but due to the lack of traffic I have reduced it from 1pm EST to 1am EST. I can always increase the up time back to 24/7 once I see traffic has picked up again.

I try to keep the feel of the game as close to vanilla as possible, yet I do have a few plugins that enhance the experience. To learn more about the server please visit [url=http://penguingaming.bugs3.com/]http://penguingaming.bugs3.com/[/url] .

The server is a white-listed server so I would have to add you to the white-list before you could log in, if you are interested and would like to try out the server please email me @ [url=http://macer1283@hotmail.com]macer1283@hotmail.com[/url] with the following information so that I may add you.
