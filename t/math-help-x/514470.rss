    <description>Hey Moparscape, i have a hugggeeee math test tomorrow and i was wondering if someone could please help me, i am in 7th grade but i have been placed in advanced math so i am really doing 8th grade math, i need some help with linear equations etc...

Here is an example:

Find the solution of the following system of equations:
x+3y=-7
6x-y=15

Please help me, i will &lt;3 you foreva :)</description>

If you have a graphing calculator with matrices support, you can make a 2x3 matrix and plug in the following:<br>
[1 3 -7]<br>
[6 -1 15]</p>
<p>and perform the “reverse row echelon form” (rref) operation. The result is the variable values.</p>
<p>If you don’t or can’t use a calculator, you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use substitution to solve for one of the variables. Like if I wanted to solve for x on the first one, I would subtract 3y from both sides. Therefore, x = -7 -3y. Now I can plug this into the second equation for x to solve for y, so I’ll have 6(-7 - 3y) - y = 15. It’s now a regular algebraic expression and you should be able to solve it from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use elimination. We basically adjust one or both equations so we can treat them like regular addition problems and cancel out one of the variables. If I wanted to eliminate y for example, I would multiply the second equation by 3 and get 18x - 3y = 45. If I add this to the top equation, y cancels out and you’re left with: 19x = 52.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you solve for one of the variables, plug it in to either of the equations to get the other one.<br>

<p>PS: It’s called reduced row echelon form. It’s used to perform gauss-jordan elimination for solving a solution of equations. Just to make sure you know the terminology, etc.[/quote]You know, the sad thing is I knew that but to double check, I Googled “rref” and that was what I got so I used it instead.</p>

</aside>
<p>The elimination method means that you are removing one factor from the two equations in order to find the solution. This being either your x or your y. For example, the two equations:</p>
<p>x+3y=-7 (1)<br>
6x-y=15 (2)<br>
^  ^  ^</p>
<p>The equation is already lined up, so you have to figure out which factor would be easier to remove. In this case it is the second factor (y), using Lin’s example. To remove this, the y factor in 1 and 2 need to match. This is when you times the bottom equation to match to top:</p>
<p>x + 3y = -7 (1)<br>
6x [sup]x3[/sup]- y [sup]x3[/sup] = 15 [sup]x3 <a>/sup</a></p>
<p>so the equation becomes:</p>
<p>x + 3y = -7 (1)<br>
18x - 3y = 45 (2)</p>
<p>Then as Lin said ‘If I add this to the top equation, y cancels out and you’re left with: 19x = 52’.</p>
<pre><code>  x + [s]3y[/s] = -7 (1)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>18x - <span class="bbcode-s">3y</span> = 45 (2)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<pre><code>     19x = 52
</code></pre>
<p>Does that help at all?</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You move the terms around.<br>
If you have:<br>
x+3y=-7 { Lets call this (1) }<br>
6x-y=15 { Lets call this (2) }</p>
<p>If you want (1) in terms of x we just move the y part away from the x.<br>
x+3y = -7<br>
(-3y from both sides)<br>
x = -7 - 3y</p>
<p>If you want (1) in terms of y we move the x away from the y and then divide to fix.<br>
x+3y = -7<br>
(-x from both sides)<br>
3y = -7 - x<br>
(Divide each side by 3 so y is on its own, Divide 3 is the same as multiplying 1/3)<br>
1/3 * 3y = 1/3(-7-x)<br>
y = 1/3(-7-x)</p>
<p>Now we can “substitute” either the x=… or y=… which we’ve just found and put it in for x or y in (2). Since x=… is the simpler of the two, it’s probably best to substitute this in:</p>
<p>6x-y=15 (This is (2) )<br>
x = -7 - 3y (This is x=… from (1))</p>
<p>6(-7 - 3y) - y = 15</p>
<p>I will then assume you’d know how to solve the for y. Once you’ve got y you just put it back into the original (1) or (2) and solve for x, or vice versa, depending on whether you used x=… or y=…</p>
<p>I pretty much repeated what Lin said, but hey, you might understand better <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
