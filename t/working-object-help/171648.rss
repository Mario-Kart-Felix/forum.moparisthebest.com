    <title>Working object ... HELP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/working-object-help/171648</link>
    <description>You know how to make items like stairs work you need to add the &quot;case ####:&quot; code. I was working on Castle Wars and i could&#39;nt get some of the stairs to work. This is what I wrote and for some reason nothing happend... It worked on other stairs. Please help someone.

THIS IS WHAT I WROTE:
[code]case 4418:   // Castle wars Stairs to 3d floor. Zamorak = 2369,3126

                if (absX == 2372 &amp; absY == 3126) {
		    teleportToX = 2369;
                    teleportToY = 3127;
                    heightLevel = 2;
		}
break;[/code]
i compile... no errors but when i go to that location and i click on stairs nothing happens.
Also maybe im not sure but could it be because the case before it is greater. for example the case before this one is &quot;Case 4470&quot;..
