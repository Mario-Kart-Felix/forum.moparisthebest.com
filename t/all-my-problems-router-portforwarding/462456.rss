    <description>Ok, so I have so many problems and I think I know why..

The Netgear Router (good router) is plugged into a &quot;Ubee router&quot; (SHIT)

If I keep the netgear, and then get a regular Arris modem and plug the netgear into that modem, do you think my problems would go away?

The ubee router is killing my netgear with slowness and problems..</description>
