    <title>HELP With server, need someone w/network help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-server-need-someone-w-network-help/165418</link>
    <description>Question:

I join my server by logging in with:
Server IP:  0.0.0.0
Port:  43594

Others try to join my server with:
Server IP: name_of_server.no-ip.info
Port:  43594

I can logon but noone else can. I have read the probably about every guide on here. I think have forwarded ALL my ports correctly. Disabled Firewalls. Disabled Anti-virus.

What could mainly be the problem is my router and mode. I have a seperate router and a seperate modem:

DSL  --&gt; modem --&gt; router --&gt; Wireless

Thats my setup ^

My router ip is 192.168.128.1 and my modem ip is 192.168.1.1
Both of those can not be the same or my internet won&#39;t work.

Under my modem, here is some information:

 LAN - Setup
DHCP
   DHCP                                              Server
   Client IP Pool Starting Address               192.168.1.2
   Size of Client IP Pool                           1
   Primary DNS Server                         0.0.0.0
   Secondary DNS Server                       0.0.0.0
   Remote DHCP Server                        N/A
 
TCP/IP
   IP Address                                      192.168.1.1
   IP Subnet Mask                                    255.255.255.252
   RIP Direction                                       Both
   RIP Version                                       RIP-2B
   Multicast                                       IGMP-v2

This is under Site Map on my Modem:

  Wizard Setup        Advanced Setup        Maintenance
Wizard Setup                 Password                        System Status
                                   LAN                               DHCP Table
                                   NAT                               Diagnostic
                                 Security                           Firmware
                                 Dynamic DNS
                                   Remote Management


My modem is from Zyxel

My router (WRT54GS) &#39;s:

local Ip address:  192.168.128.1
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Starting Ip address: 192.168.128.100
Static DNS 1 (2 and 3 as well)   is currently 0.0.0.0  ( I can change these)

Port Forward

43594 to 43594   TCP/UDP  192.168.128.100  Enabled


DMZ Host IP Address:  192.168.128.2

I DONT Have anything set under port triggering.
I have a tab called QoS that looks kind of like port forwarding if I enable it.


1. I run No-Ip
2. I run the compiler.bat
3. I run runserver.bat
4. I login on my server
5. Noone else can log on

I have a video of my problem, download my video from:

http://rapidshare.com/files/76860847/clip0002.avi

Watch it on full screen so none of the text displays weird.

Then post what my problem could be.

Thanks....
