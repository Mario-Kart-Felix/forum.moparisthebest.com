    <title>Adding shops that take Pk points</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-shops-that-take-pk-points/284786</link>
    <description>Can someone help me make a shop that takes PK points? I meen actually takes them. For example if you had 36 pk points, and in the shop you bought a yellow p hat for 30 pk points, your total pk points would move down to 6. Is this even possible to do? Thanks in advance to anyone who helps.</description>
