    <description>Well, my server goes up, but people can&#39;t login..

Everything was working fine until I started updating my client.java, then when I restarted the server, this happened. So I figured I did something wrong with the client.java. I tried taking the client.java back to a few days where everything was working fine, but it still happens. I also have no errors on the compiler, so this is weird. Please help.</description>
