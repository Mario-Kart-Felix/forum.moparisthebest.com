    <description>Well, this isn&#39;t really a request, but theres a script that I saw a long time ago, pretty much, you would open up paint, and the script would paint &#39;SRL&#39; in big, green letters using the pencil tool. I have no idea who wrote it, what it was called, or when it was released.  :D  Well if anyone&#39;s got it, or another script like it, could&#39;ja pm it to me?  :cool:</description>
