<p>alright me and my friend made a clan (after this it died) and we decided we would round about about 25 people and go pking a week. well we all were 90+ as it was a 90+ clan and ended up going with like 15 people so we though we would own you know? well it ended up that we ran into another clan in 45 wild it was funny being the only ancient because pkers seem to hate them… well basically is was 50 vs 15 so we lost. lol later we found out that this lvl 100 bsed us he lured us the entire time. well in the end it was funny but i lost around 600k =\ all in all about 5m lost… if you saw it you would laugh at it it was freakin funny .</p>

He said he was a member and he wanted me to prove that I was one too so I said “come over to world 41 and I’ll show you” Then he says “hell no, you’re gonna hack me” And I say “Wtf? I don’t even know you” And he continues asking me to prove that I was a member and I continue to tell him to come to world 41 with me, and he continues to say I’m gonna hack him. If you ask me that’s pretty paranoid.</p>
