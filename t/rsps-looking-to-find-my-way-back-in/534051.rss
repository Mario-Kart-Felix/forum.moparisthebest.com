    <title>RSPS looking to find my way back in</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-looking-to-find-my-way-back-in/534051</link>
    <description>I am an old time coder looking to help others for free. I am just looking to get back into the business without having to run my own. I have never worked with another person I have always done my own work. It has been about a year now I know I can get back in fast and much better than before. I have left the community for a year before and came back better. Hopefully I come back even better! You can contact me if you would like me to join as a server coder. I am not worried about server owner or admin just looking to join in on the fun! Looking for servers that have been up for awhile not looking to get into servers that aren&#39;t even online yet. Thanks for reading. I can type around 60 WPM if it helps.</description>
