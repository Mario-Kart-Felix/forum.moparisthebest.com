<p>You should hate humanity, for it is to blame. Nowadays people care about gossip. IMO, everything that is even closely related to populism should be destroyed (ie gossip sites, celebrity watchers, every fucking series about such crap (gossip girl(Ya they broadcast it in the Netherlands now)) Politicians listening to the plebs(we have a lot in the Netherlands))</p>
<p>Who the fuck cares about the personal life of actors anyways? I don’t give a fuck about the fact that John Travolta has a retarded poodle.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Thug-life, post:16, topic:286564”]Joe Jackson should be dead. He is the reason for MJ being like he was and infact, probably one of the reasons he became one of, if not the greatest musical entertainer of all time. So its a two sided coin, one side he seriously damaged his mental health, other side he helped him become what he became as an artist.</p>
<p>His dad beat him, starved him of contact with other kids, pushed him to be what he was at early age, he had no child hood and his later years compensated for that. Yes, it was inappropriate for a man of his age to have such a relationship with a child, to be acting like a child, playing with children as if he was a child and such, but i don’t think he any <em>abused</em> any chid.</p>
<p>What the media seemed to ignore that there was so many parents of children who all said that MJ would always ask them if they wanted to stay over with their children too, it was always open for them to come whenever they wanted while their kids were there.</p>
<p>It seems strange me saying this, because i was one of those joining in, calling him a pedo - but remembering back then, just watching interviews with jackson (Before child abuse claims), reading about the child abuse charges, reading everything he was accused of and then looking back at stuff that was there before any of this child abuse BS came to light.</p>
<p>I’d say it wasn’t the children getting abused, it was Michael, they abused his trust and the media abused him with starting BS rumours, even the most trivial ones.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah not many ignorant people understand that. They think he is actually weird for his age when actually the time he lived up to was compensating for his childhood. I saw a documentary of him the other day, he was actually forced to be a nice guy. When they - him and his bros (during his child hood) - would practice producing music their dad would have a belt in his hand or w/e he could find to hit them with if they got ANY STEP wrong. This is wut I believe brought him to wut he was as a great POP guy, if any man (can’t actually say grown) deserves as much respect like Micheal Jackson it would have to be a child in a mans body like Micheal Jackson was.</p>
<p>People think he was wierd but its sort of reversed for Micheal Jackson. He did a man thing at a child’s age and did a child thing at a man’s age. Very hard to be believe unless you know his history.</p>
<p>As for Joe, he has nothing to say as usual and literally retarded. If he was my dad I would stab him like Gatis Lagzden(Kids Ranqe) did at his school. He needed/need to be killed if you talking about the subject of If’s with him involved in it.</p>

<p>“The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic”<br>
I’m sorry to say, but soldiers dying is a statistic. Ok it’s sad that they’re dead, but they signed their own ‘death contract’ by joining the Army you know there is a big chance of getting K.I.A.<br>
Don’t get me wrong! It’s sad that those soldiers are dying for a ‘good cause’(???).</p>
<p>Now MJ however was a icon, a living legend. Sure he might’ve did things that I can’t approve as a person. But that doesn’t take away the great musician he was! He was one big inspiration for the whole world. Everyone in the world knows MJ. From the age of 5 till his death (50 y.o) he was famous. The man never had any rest of whatsoever, it’s better for him that he is dead.</p>
<p>As for Joe… I don’t have a good word for him.</p>
