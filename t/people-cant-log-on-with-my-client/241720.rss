    <title>People can&#39;t log on with my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/people-cant-log-on-with-my-client/241720</link>
    <description>I downloaded a client and a server, i edited both of them. I let one of my admins download the client to test it out, but when he tried to log in all it would say is error connecting to server. People can log on with silabs, and it has no server id thing where u type in the server (and yes i have the set server as my ip and the port is right). So if anyone has any idea what could be wrong please post here. THX!!! ;D</description>

              <p>You can change the preset IP in EGUI.java, Also you can change some other IP,s in client.java, and GUI.java.</p>
<p>Before you let someone test out your client, make sure you delete your .rar file, and then on your server files right click and do <code>add to blablabla.rar</code></p>
<p>and let them try that one out.</p>

              <p>I’d help if I remembered. but you need special client for it to be set to your specific IP, And maybe try putting up NO-IP or something.
