    <title>Something about lawyers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/something-about-lawyers/538372</link>
    <description>Welp, as most of you are either children or not from the USA, this may be a silly question to ask such a community.  BUT, here goes:

Almost 2 years ago, I was working for a guy who I foolishly let use my Paypal to sell car parts.  I knew him IRL, was working for him for a few months.  Was consistently late paying me any money he had promised, etc.

Anyways, he rang up almost $4,000 on the Paypal card and has been promising me ever since for payment.  I have Facebook logs of him explaining to me that he&#39;d have the money countless times.  I&#39;m sure I could inquire with my cell phone provider for messages with this individual, etc.  I&#39;m sure I could also contact Paypal for the purchases that they&#39;ve made using the card in the area where he live(d).  

Now, none of us have ever signed anything or had anything in writing (other than Facebook/texts).  Is there anything I can do?  I was going to speak with a lawyer, but I don&#39;t really know how they work (Yano, it seems some specialize in this, specialize in that).

Any help would be appreciated.  And I know I can&#39;t inb4 myself, but inb4 some jackass says I got screwed.</description>

<p>In fact, you don’t need anything in writing. A verbal contract holds up just as much as anything else, and with the Facebook messages and everything, you should be set.</p>
<p>As for a lawyer, don’t go that route. Take him to small claims court, and sue him for the amount, plus court fees.</p>
<p>You’ll win without a doubt.</p>

              <p>IANAL: I don’t think you can do anything about it, the best you could probably do is fight with paypal over him racking up more charges than he was supposed to - but even then it’s a slim shot they’ll give a shit. You basically voluntarily gave out your information to him. If your paypal account is linked to your bank, you could possibly spin it as your account being compromised. However, if this has been an ongoing en-devour then it won’t be convincing, especially if they ring him up and he explains the situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, lawyer fees are expensive, let alone going to court. It’s only $4K, cut your losses.</p>
