    <title>Adding a custom object [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-a-custom-object-pi/506679</link>
    <description>Hello reader

Recently, I and sk8rdude461 have been trying to add a custom object model to the client in various ways, without success.

I had added the model (with number 67000) in the Raw folder of my cache and also as a part of the compressed models file. After that, the ints in ObjectDef.java were declared. Now when you spawn the item, you do get an object with the right click-option and examine info, but not with the correct models. These are the ints used in ObjectDef.java
[code]case 11215:
					objectDef.name = &quot;Mystery Box&quot;; 
					objectDef.description = &quot;Click me to get a random weapon to fend against the zombie hoard!&quot;.getBytes();
					objectDef.anInt744 = 1;
					objectDef.anInt761 = 1;
					objectDef.anIntArray773 = new int[1];
					objectDef.anIntArray773[0] = 67000;
					objectDef.itemActions = new String[5];
					objectDef.itemActions[0] = &quot;Hit-Box&quot;;
					objectDef.hasActions = true;
					objectDef.aBoolean767 = false;
					objectDef.aBoolean762 = false;
					objectDef.aBoolean769 = false;[/code]
If you know how to add models for objects, please tell me so.

FYI: sk8rdude tried adding this model to an item and then spawned it, which worked, so the way objects and items get loaded is different.

Any help is more than appreciated

Regards

JavaLearner

P.S.: This can be moved to the Models section if needed. (Sorry if I posted it wrong)</description>

              <p>The part you’re going wrong in is objectdef…is it a new ITEM or a new OBJECT? I don’t think objects go in the raw folder. I believe you have to actually cache pack them to index 2 or something.</p>
