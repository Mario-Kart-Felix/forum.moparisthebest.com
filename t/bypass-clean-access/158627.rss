    <title>Bypass Clean access?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bypass-clean-access/158627</link>
    <description>Hello, my school is a laptop school and they have installed something new this year, called Cisco CleanAccess. It makes it so you can only get on the network if you have Sophos Anti-virus installed [they&#39;ll only give it to you if you image it to the network], which I do not want. I was wondering if anyone could help me find another way onto the internet at school?
Thanks
Justis
PS
To clarify, you can get connected to the network, but you cannot get onto the internet [not ftp/nntp/http/anything] without Clean Access.</description>

              <p>It’s okay, thanks, and I did try it with linux, although I didn’t try anything special with it. I think I shall try installing a version of Sophos not linked to the school [to protect privacy] and see if it works like that.</p>

              <p>From what I just read quickly (via google) they fix bypass exploits quickly, although something I skimmed over mentioned changing your browsers user-agent or using a different OS such as Linux. Sorry that I can’t help that much.</p>
