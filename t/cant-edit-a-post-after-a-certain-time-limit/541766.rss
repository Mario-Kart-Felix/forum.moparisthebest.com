    <title>Can&#39;t Edit A Post After A Certain Time Limit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-edit-a-post-after-a-certain-time-limit/541766</link>
    <description>Since I was the last to post in the RuneScape drops thread, I can&#39;t make a new post. So, I was going to edit my last post, but, there was no button to edit it. I got an edit link from one of my previous posts and put in the correct topic and message id, but it said I couldn&#39;t edit it because the time limit for edits has expired. When was a time limit for for edits added?</description>
