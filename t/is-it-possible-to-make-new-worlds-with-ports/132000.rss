    <title>Is it possible to make new worlds with ports?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible-to-make-new-worlds-with-ports/132000</link>
    <description>Just wondering because I was thinking about doing this myself...

Anyways I was thinking about copying the server.java extention file and remodifying its property, which would allow the player to switch worlds between ports or i could probably import ports in the same file extention. Not sure if it will work though...

But my point is. Is it possible?</description>
