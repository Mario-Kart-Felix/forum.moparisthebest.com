              <p>just a little tip by the way, as i see its better to learn then to spoonfeed,</p>
<p>“Exception in the thread “main” noclassdeffounderror: Egui”</p>
<p>Basically what its telling you is, it cant find the class “egui” which i dont really understand what that is, it might have been a type in the coding if you edited anything.</p>
<p>Check all your paths in your client be sure everything is set correctly.</p>

              <p>Look at your client and look at the name of the gui. Is it named egui, gui, GUI, EGUI? click edit on your run and make sure the EGUI matches the gui used.<br>
Its basically saying it can’t find the file, this is no fault of your own, the programmer should of checked this so maybe your not using the best client you could be if he has made a mistake like this and hasn’t tested it or your winrar(or whatever you use) has missed out the file when it was downloaded.</p>
