    <title>Need help with my client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-client/540177</link>
    <description>Hi,
 as my topic says i need help with it. But im not even sure if it doable. If it is then could someone help me set my client so only 1 client can be opened per computer. 

And how to set restriction so only 1 account can be done per day.

Waiting for help. Thanks^^.</description>

<p>OP you will need to keep track of logged-in IPs and make sure nobody can multi-login.<br>
Here is a simplistic model,</p>
<p>[code=java]<br>
HashMap&lt;String, Object&gt; playerList = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();<br>
String connectingHost = “…”;</p>
<p>if (!playerList.containsKey(connectingHost)) {<br>
// login as usual<br>
} else {<br>
// multi-login, terminate session<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>Note: this can be over-come by the use of proxies, for which local killing of multiple client applications should suffice to some degree.</p>
