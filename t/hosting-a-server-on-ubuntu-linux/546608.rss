              <p>There’s tutorials on how to set up Java applications via Linux. Linux uses less resources, so it’s not really a bad thing that you got a Linux VPS, they’re also cheaper since they don’t usually come with a GUI. The rough steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download Putty to access the VPS through Shell.</li>
<li>Install the Java package.</li>
<li>Transfer your source, quickest way is to install a FTP server like Filezilla and send it through FTP.</li>
<li>Navigate to the directory of your source and start the run.bat</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know the full steps since I’m complete shit when it comes to Linux, but it’s something like that. Just search for instructions on how to set up a RSPS on Linux, if you can find one, look for instructions on how to set up a Java application/server on Linux.</p>
