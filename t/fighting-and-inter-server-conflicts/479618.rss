    <title>Fighting and inter-server conflicts</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fighting-and-inter-server-conflicts/479618</link>
    <description>Just like I said on the RSC boards many years ago, I&#39;ll say again here.

Quit the fucking arguing and issues you guys have against each other. Argue on skype, over pm, over IRC--anywhere but here. I expect the staff to not tolerate this. I am not talking about petty arguments, but more of the extreme conflicts we&#39;ve seen with RuneRebels and Project RS06.

This is the one and only warning. If anyone continues those arguments, they will be banned from this site without question, whether they are staff or normal member. Staff members at this site are expected to know better, as should members.</description>
