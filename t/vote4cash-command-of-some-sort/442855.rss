    <title>Vote4cash command of some sort?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vote4cash-command-of-some-sort/442855</link>
    <description>basicly i was wondering if there was a command that would able players to vote and receive and award at the end, been searching on the internet for hours and can&#39;t seem to find a guide that will accually check whether the player has voted then once the server has that conformation the player can do ::claim or something because they could just cheat the system.

im using a 637 source And am a bit familier with coding (not the best but i know my way around)

thanks in advance to anyone who can help me!</description>
