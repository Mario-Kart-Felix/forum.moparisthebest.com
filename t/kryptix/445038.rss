<p>A lot of information about Luke’s personal life.<br>
Quite moving :/.<br>
There is probably things Luke didn’t want to talk about with the people he knew online but we all have some “embarrassing” things we hide and I trust the people in this forum wont post some stupid shit.[/quote]</p>
<p>That was really well written. I can’t help but wondering if the ‘special friend’ is Zilent, I know they were pretty close.</p>

Not sure what to think about this. I wouldn’t care that its nerdy but I’m afraid it would get out  of hands.</p>
<p>And about the npc. It would always be there reminding about Luke and I’m not sure is that the best way to handle grief :/.<br>

If Luke got to make money doing something he liked doing, it would give him more incentive to produce better content (because it would mean more money for him).

The issue isn’t that he made money off of it, the issue is that he said all of the money will go towards the server.</p>
<p>This has been said several dozen time, so go find a thread that it’s been discussed in, and read it.</p>
<p>Anyway, stop with your idiotic and ignorant posts.  This thread isn’t for you being a dumbass, it’s for discussing Kryptix’s death.  If you’d like to continue, make a new thread.</p>
