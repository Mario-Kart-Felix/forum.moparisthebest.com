<a class="mention" href="../../u/king.html">@king</a>, did he have a helmet? Probably wouldn’t have matter either way but I’m just curious. Also I hope your(travas too) mourn is short,<br>
I too lost a good friend recently and it is hard.<br>
[/quote]I don’t think he would have went without a helmet. All the pictures of him are pictures with helmets and it’s probably against the law not to wear one. Not 100% sure though.[/quote]<br>
plus i don’t think that would have helped?..</p>

Most of the haters at rsce are probably just posting on multiple accounts because they are fucking sick assholes. Most likely Luke had banned them for autoing :). You have to understand that they are retards.</p>

<p>Luke dished it out just as hard as everyone else dished it to him.  People didn’t just didn’t dislike him for no reason, his actions and behaviors directly caused and warranted the treatment he received.</p>
<p>That being said, he wasn’t always a dick and he wasn’t always nice; he was human, just like the rest of us.  He acted differently depending on the situation and his surroundings, just like the rest of us.  He chose to act certain ways towards people, good or bad, just like the rest of us.  In short, he was human, just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>The reason people apologize after someone dies depends on a number of factors, and can be for any number of reasons.  Here are a few:<br>
They realize how petty they were being.<br>
They are following social protocol and being respectful of the dead.<br>
The want to get things off their chest as a part of creating a sense of closure.<br>
They simply want to get things off their chest.<br>
They want to say one last thing to him.</p>
<p>Basically, everyone who interacted with him is going to react differently, everyone had a different relationship with him for whatever reason.  Not everyone wanted to be his friend, just like everyone doesn’t want to be your friend, or my friend.  So, instead of judging people for their decisions and acting as if Luke had no part in their opinion/relationship, how about you stop being ignorant and just let people do what they need to do, and say what they need to say.</p>

<p>It’s they type of shit that made people hate him and got them really pissed off.[/quote]Yes but he was making more than enough to cover the server. When Matt was doing it, the server was half-assed and he was in it purely for the money. If Luke got to make money doing something he liked doing, it would give him more incentive to produce better content (because it would mean more money for him). It also gave him more time to actually work on the server. If you didn’t agree with how he spent his own money, then you didn’t need to subscribe.</p>

GF our sub money… Probably paid for the bike he wrecked on. Always sucks when people die early but I’m not going to pretend I liked him just because he’s dead now.</p>
<p>Inb4 random lag or double backs in wildy become “the ghost of luke”<br>
[/quote]Who cares what he bought with your sub money?<br>
[/quote]Really?  How many times was this point brought up?</p>
<p>When he started and had the vote on donations, he said that all of the money would go towards the server.  This is because that is what Matt was doing, and Luke didn’t like it.</p>
<p>It’s they type of shit that made people hate him and got them really pissed off.<br>
[/quote]Yes but he was making more than enough to cover the server. When Matt was doing it, the server was half-assed and he was in it purely for the money. If Luke got to make money doing something he liked doing, it would give him more incentive to produce better content (because it would mean more money for him). It also gave him more time to actually work on the server. If you didn’t agree with how he spent his own money, then you didn’t need to subscribe.[/quote]You must be a complete fucking retard.  The issue isn’t that he made money off of it, the issue is that he said all of the money will go towards the server.</p>
<p>This has been said several dozen time, so go find a thread that it’s been discussed in, and read it.</p>
<p>Anyway, stop with your idiotic and ignorant posts.  This thread isn’t for you being a dumbass, it’s for discussing Kryptix’s death.  If you’d like to continue, make a new thread.</p>
