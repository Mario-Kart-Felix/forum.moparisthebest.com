    <title>Flare - The Final Build</title>

    <description>[center][IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/2mhastw.png[/img][/center]

     I had a relapse due to an abundance of spare time these last two weeks and started working on Flare again. Over these last two weeks I have written and re-written a good deal of the protocol handling, core functionality, and content. In a stability test on my single tower Flare held over 2000 bots spamming packets as well as 2000 npcs. Although the lag spiked during the height of this test I never lost the ability to move or log in and out.

The photo below was taken when the connection cap was reached. Keep in mind player saving was disabled for this test. This was also before a ground item system was implemented, none the less this server should be able to handle more than what would ever be needed in the current private server scene. I assume its only a matter of time before this is buried underneath 10 minute edits of Winter-Love based servers though.

After the core had been beefed up I moved on-to content. Since lets be honest, no-one would even consider this unless it had a base for content alongside an impressive core. This build of Flare currently inclues:


[ul][li]Player Saving with Json :   Player Saving was written using the Json library for a number of reasons, the biggest being the need for a fast parser which was easy to edit within the context of code. Currently Json is only used for parsing player files, everything else is loaded before the server is ever online so a millisecond interval difference isn&#39;t an issue at this point. 

[/li]

[li]New modifications to Protocol Decoding :   Prior to this build of flare protocol was decoded in a switch statement with an enumeration, lately i&#39;ve been reading more into design patterns and I now realize this was a mistake. I instead switched to an abstract operator which handles each stage in a more object oriented fashion. 

[/li]

[li]Equipment : Along with the updates to the inventory system equipment is another feature that was added. All types of equipment are supported with proper coverage and definition for all items. Switching with two handed weapons is also fully functional as well as a complete handle on stackable items. Specification for standing, walking, and running emotes is completed too, although i suppose it could be handled better.

[/li]

[li]Ground Items : Ground items was one of the latest features added to Flare. To my knowledge it is completed although if any bugs can be found with this code or any other code for that matter don&#39;t hesitate to post them in a comment. There is currently support for ground item stacks, appearing for proper players, disappearing for proper players, dropping, and picking up with walk-to actions. 

[/li]

[li] Skills : A very basic grasp on skills has been completed. Skills can grow by level when experience is added, display in the correct tab with experience, and save upon log-out.

[/li]

[li]
Mobs (Non-player-characters) : In this revision there is also support for Mobs or NPCs the updating for them is complete as well as loading them from an external text file (Reasons for this usage above). There is constant distance checking for NPC&#39;s (And players) to make sure we only need to update what we can actually see.

[/li]

[li]
Teleporting : Teleporting as well as the animation and graphic update blocks have been completed. When teleporting you can&#39;t move or perform a different teleport until the current one is completed. This and all other minor events are processed on a separate game thread which runs in its own event manager. Once the player or owner of the even has been removed all the events for that owner are removed from the system as well.
[/li][/ul]

I have only elaborated heavily on the newest content and modifications, there is still all of the previous content with many bug fixes.


[ul][li] Private messaging : Supports logging in and out as well as sending messages (Obviously!) 

[/li]

[li] Movement : Both walking and running are can be toggled and to my knowledge work perfectly.

[/li]

[li] Inventory Container : Supports swapping, item stacks, and addition and deletion (If possible).

[/li]

[li] Chatting : Players are able to speak?
[/li][/ul]


I would like to give a special thanks to Ryley Kimmel and Matthew Bishop for talking over design ideas with me.

Please make something good out of this, i&#39;ve poured my blood (Banging on the keyboard), sweat (Shit got intense), and tears (Crying because my code wouldn&#39;t work) into this.

Side Notes : This server comes with a very easy to follow packaging and all current content is saved upon log-out. Like I stated above if anyone has any questions, concerns, or bugs please leave a comment below. I may find time to work on this again in the future but for the time being i&#39;m taking a break. This server can also run on the Moparscape client if you decrypt the player&#39;s password. Iirc correctly the moparscape client encrypts the password during the connection (Might be wrong).

P.S : I&#39;m sorry for any poor grammar or bad explanations, it&#39;s late and i&#39;m going to bed very soon. I&#39;ll fix anything along these lines in the morning.</description>

<p>Please make something good out of this, i’ve poured my blood (Banging on the keyboard), sweat (Shit got intense), and tears (Crying because my code wouldn’t work) into this.</p>
<p>Side Notes : This server comes with a very easy to follow packaging and all current content is saved upon log-out. Like I stated above if anyone has any questions, concerns, or bugs please leave a comment below. I may find time to work on this again in the future but for the time being i’m taking a break. This server can also run on the Moparscape client if you decrypt the player’s password. Iirc correctly the moparscape client encrypts the password during the connection (Might be wrong).</p>
<p>P.S : I’m sorry for any poor grammar or bad explanations, it’s late and i’m going to bed very soon. I’ll fix anything along these lines in the morning.</p>
