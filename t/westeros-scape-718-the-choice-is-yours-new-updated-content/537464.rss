[SIZE=3]Welcome to Westeros-Scape where the choice is yours.[/SIZE]

Westeros-Scape is a new server that me and my development team have been working on for the past month. It is quite a large project and there are lots of small things we want to get right. We wanted to create a server that no one had ever come up with before, not just a pk, pvm and dice server, no we wanted a fully fledged RPG, much like &quot;Real RuneScape&quot;, I know there are some out there, but none like ours. If you want to know what makes it so unique, read on. If not, just click some of these links below. The current BETA is based of Matrix, however the full release removes so much Matrix crap, its almost not there. To read on the lore, just click [URL=http://&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ds9g8htqrksqgm/Westeros%20Lore.pdf&quot;]HERE.[/URL]

We have had some serious updates! We will be moving out of BETA and into the full release within 2 weeks. Here is some small updates we have:

[QUOTE]Hello Everyone !
I know you guys have been waiting for this new source and the path that will lead us there is shortening everyday. We think that it&#39;ll be open to public before the 15th of January.
Now, just to show you a bit of what&#39;s happening, I&#39;ll give you a short tour of the server as it is right now... Enjoy!

Emotes are properly working and so are bosses, there&#39;s even more places to go, but I won&#39;t show it here, you&#39;ll have to be patient ;)[/QUOTE]

[IMG]http://westeros-scape.com/content.png[/img]
So, what is in Westeros-Scape that makes it unique? Well first of all, the whole idea behind the server is around a imaginary world called &quot;Westeros&quot; created by the brilliant mind of George R.R. Martin, Westeros is where the &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot; book series is set, to you noobs, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Now with such a rich back-story created for us by George R.R. Martin we can really stretch what we want to do and make it unique. Although currently we are only in a BETA, in the full release we have planed a lot of content, which is here for you now:

[/CENTER]

[ul][*]Custom &quot;Factions&quot; based of the 5 main factions in Westeros.
[*]Faction wars, our take on Clan Wars, basically a cross between Castle Wars and Clan Wars, Factions battle it out for victory which, with every match won increases the Factions rights to Westeros-Scape.
[*]Custom &quot;Scam Free&quot; dicing, inspired by Grinderscape, we are re-creating it in our own way.
[*]A HUGE 5-way custom quest line. Depending on which Faction you choose to join depends on your story, along with the decisions you decide to make in each quest.
[*]Loads of Westeros inspired custom items such as Eddard Starks sword, &quot;Ice&quot;.
[*]All the important characters from the books.
[*]Some interesting 18+ features (A particular brothel may be included).
[*]About every skill is 100% coded. We are working on making skilling, pvp and pvm as close to real rs as possible so people don&#39;t have to go with the Westeros Story line if they don&#39;t want to.
[*]Probably a lot more that I should list but, maybe you will just have to find out![/ul]

[CENTER]
I could go into the whole Lore and all the ideas I have planed for the server here, but you are going to just have to look on our website!
