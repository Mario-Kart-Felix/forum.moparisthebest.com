    <description>Hello all of MoparScape coders and all other ppl that are here :D i&#39;m not realy good with php and mysqp specialy when it comes to fusing server with mysql so i want to ask ppl of this forum that maby they could create a sys designed for https://www.webtopay.com/ that would generate a code when you send SMS and send the code to sender as response and then create a page that could ask sender to add his nickname and the code he receved and then he would get membership and other status for 30 days btw i would need extra 3 code receve pages that would diferently create codes for moderator/admin/owner subcriptions of course there could be another whole system that sender could collect money and then spend it as he wants say buy 100m on server but that isisnt neseccery for now cuz i just need some 1 to create auto membership system for https://www.webtopay.com/ that would send back a code and a page that would requre that code to become member for 30 days if some 1 would create whole system with items and stuff i will pay to them 2.5 euro by paypal thanks for reading and ofcourse there is rep and admin status on my server to who ever creates or finds tut for this system thats all for now

P.S. https://www.webtopay.com/ and https://www.daopay.com/ arent the same systems https://www.webtopay.com/ needs to use files to give respond as generated code like pay.php or something like that

Sorry if i made any mistakes in typing the text i get distracted some times and miswrite letters :D


Please post if you even try to create it

P.S.2 I&#39;m using BishScape as source so it would be good if you create auto memb for that source</description>
