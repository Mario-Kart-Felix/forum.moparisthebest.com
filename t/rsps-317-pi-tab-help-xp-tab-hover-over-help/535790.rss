    <title>Rsps 317 [pi] Tab help &amp; Xp tab hover over help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-317-pi-tab-help-xp-tab-hover-over-help/535790</link>
    <description>Hello, i have 2 questions i would like to ask, and if any one helps me that would be great!! I&#39;m going to try to explain the 2 problems the best i can, any more info just ask. 

1. I&#39;m aware of the fact that you can change the game frame 377,474, etc etc. and i had to fix them cause the logout tab was clanchat tab etc. I spent 2 days trying to get this, and i&#39;m stumped on it so i need help :( Trying to make music tab into summoning tab instead, but can&#39;t seem to change sicon nor change tabinterface(im new with tabinterface) not asking to spoonfeed me just wondering how to change tabs. Im sure its in client.java but can&#39;t seem to get it. Hope that covers it thanks in adv.! (pic of example below)

2. Last but not least, in the skill tab you can hover over the skill like attack for example and it says &quot;current Xp&quot; &quot;Next level&quot; etc. i looked up tuts and found a couple but getting T1 and T2 errors and not working. This is what my hover looks like currently :

Heres the code i used from another tut in client.java &amp; also already replaced skills.java(but didnt seem to work maybe leaving out a code?) : 

[code]public String[] skillNames = { &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Hitpoints&quot;, &quot;Mining&quot;, &quot;Strength&quot;, &quot;Agility&quot;,
         &quot;Smithing&quot;, &quot;Defence&quot;, &quot;Herblore&quot;, &quot;Fishing&quot;, &quot;Range&quot;, &quot;Thieving&quot;,
         &quot;Cooking&quot;, &quot;Prayer&quot;, &quot;Crafting&quot;, &quot;Firemaking&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Fletching&quot;, &quot;Woodcutting&quot;,
         &quot;Rune&quot;, &quot;Slayer&quot;, &quot;Farming&quot;, &quot;Construction&quot;, &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Summoning&quot;,
         &quot;Dungeoneering&quot; };
   public String setMessage(int level){
      String[] messages = new String[4];
      String message = &quot;&quot;;
      int maxLevel = 99;
      if(maxStats[level] &gt; maxLevel){
         if(level != 24){
            maxStats[level] = 99;
         }else if(maxStats[level] &gt; 120){
            maxStats[level] = 120;
         }
      }
       int[] stuff = {0,3,14,2,16,13,1,15,10,4,17,7,5,12,11,6,9,8,20,18,19,21,22,23,24};
      messages[0] = skillNames[level]+&quot;: &quot;+currentStats[stuff[level]]+&quot;/&quot;+maxStats[stuff[level]]+&quot;\\n&quot;;
      messages[1] = &quot;Current XP: &quot; + getXPForLevel(maxStats[stuff[level]])+&quot;\\n&quot;;
      messages[2]= &quot;Next level: &quot;+ (getXPForLevel(maxStats[stuff[level]]+1)-getXPForLevel(maxStats[stuff[level]]))+&quot;\\n&quot;;
      messages[3]= &quot;Remainder: &quot;+ getXPForLevel(maxStats[stuff[level]]+1);
      message = messages[0] + messages[1] + messages[2] + messages[3];
      return message;
   }[/code]
