              <p>From what I know. Each world is a different server. If you have ever looked on runescape’s lobby, each world has a different ping. That is because they are located around the world, the idea is to find the one closest to you, so you experience the best game play. No, I do not know how to add this to your server or client.</p>
<p>But here are some things you need to do:</p>
<p>Make a world switch lobby, each world is a different IP (players don’t need to see/know that).</p>
<p>Find a way to transfer the character data over from one server to the other. Meaning finding which player file is the newest, and send that one to the server the player is connecting to.</p>
<p>Have multiple servers (changing it to a different port isn’t exactly new “worlds” but a cheap hax…)</p>
<p>Look at Hack3rs client, he implemented “world switching” by changing the IP you connect to. One was local host, the other wasn’t. That’s been released in many clients (And I’m sure there’s a tutorial out for it).</p>
