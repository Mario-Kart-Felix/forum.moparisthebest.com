    <description>Hey guys/girls, i am having some trouble adding item bonuses to drygores thats currently on my server, i think the source is zenith but it says extinction source v2. i have no idea were to go to change the stats of them dryogres, the codes are something like 1221 and shit (not sure if that helps) but i just need someone who can walk me threw it. Feel free to add me on skype if it would make things easier.
