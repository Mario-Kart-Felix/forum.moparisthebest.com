    <title>A few small problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-small-problems/224605</link>
    <description>Well, actually this isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve played MoparScape. I played a while back...god know how long ago. Maybe two to three years ago. I don&#39;t know if anything has changed (aside from obvious things I&#39;ve noticed like the server status page and the webclient), but things seem a little more complicated than they were back then. 

[u]Clarifying: I&#39;m not making a server, I just downloaded these from the download section.[/u]

Alright, so here&#39;s my problem. I&#39;ve got a couple of errors that I&#39;m hoping some of you can help me solve. Before you say it, [b]yes[/b] I have the latest JDK version, [b]yes[/b] I used the search option, [b]yes[/b] I looked at all the tutorials, [b]yes[/b] I read every FAQ, and as far as I know, I&#39;ve tried everything to my knowledge (note the my knowledge part). None of them helped. 
[u]
My first problem is this[/u]: Every server I try to log onto on the web client says &quot;Error Connecting to Server. Must be down.&quot; Honestly, all of them can&#39;t be down. Like I said I have the latest version of JDK and all that shebang. Does anyone have tips?

[u]Second Problem[/u]: Many of the servers that I&#39;ve downloaded to use on my computer do not let me log in. Every time it&#39;s &quot;You are already logged in.&quot; I&#39;ve tried restarting the server, I&#39;ve went through the files and deleted my account, I&#39;ve compiled, downloaded the &#39;Perfect&#39; compiler just like the tutorial recommended, reinstalled MoparScape, and tried other servers. Nothing. All say that I&#39;m already logged in.Tips would be appreciated.

Kind of made me wonder if maybe I have been extracting the files wrong? Here are screenshots of how I have it set up:

[u]MAIN[/u]

[u]INSIDE MOPARSCAPE FILE[/u]

Anyway, those are my main problems. If it helps, here&#39;s some of these errors I get too.

This is what it also says when I get the &quot;Your account is already logged in&quot; error. I&#39;ve set the path like it said in one of the tutorials.

And here is what happens when I try to compile:

I hope the information I provided is enough, if you need more just request it. Hope someone can help. Thanks.</description>

              <p>I feel like I’m not understanding some of the things you are telling me correctly. Just to clarify, I’m not making a server, I just downloaded it off of the downloads section.</p>
<p>Anyway, so what I did was double click the “d d s p 3” server that I downloaded, right clicked, added a new folder called “connectedfrom” as so:</p>
<p><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v408/snowfox10/m9.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The blue folder is the “connectedfrom” folder. The same error was still there.</p>

<p>I don’t really know what I’m doing here, just basic computer usage skills. I wouldn’t have any right to flame you.</p>
<p>Can you go into a little more detail possibly? When you say change the run.bat, what do I change it to? And do I change in my the MoparScape file or on the servers that I’ve downloaded?</p>
