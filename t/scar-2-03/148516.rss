    <title>Scar 2.03</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scar-2-03/148516</link>
    <description>Since I&#39;ve heard that most of the good SCAR scripts still only remain usable on SCAR 2.03.. I took to downloading it, but every link i&#39;ve used for SCAR 2.03 has a virus according to AVG (I&#39;ve even used the one on Freddy1990&#39;s website) - I was thinking maybe AVG was being annoying, so I disabled it and tried to run SCAR 2.03 but it gives me this error: ( on every download I&#39;ve tried )
