    <title>Dirt to Gold - Building an Empire</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dirt-to-gold-building-an-empire/554432</link>
    <description>Looking for 1-3 people to help design and develop a dynamic server from the ground up.
The language is undefined at this point. If one is chosen by the group that you do not know, you will be expected to learn it. This means we may have to throw some code out in the future. 
The only thing I want out of the server is to be 317 based. It can have custom content from there.

This is a learning experience for everyone. Sorry - not for profit. 
It will look good on a resume.
It will be a forerunner in the world of RSPS when it is completed.


I have two ideas for the language; Java and C++.
Java has an issue with the JVM controlling memory managment. If we want to write a fast server that cannot be the case. 
Java would be nice for the simplicity and knowledge background. I have been working with it for over 10 years now.
C++ gives you control over how things are placed in memory. This will be extremely important for us. Utilizing a data oriented design (DOD) many things can be accomplished that previously could not. 

If you need a resource for DOD, I have found a book that i found very helpful in explaining it.

Your focus should be on the data - not the structure. If you know what is happening to the data, that is all you need to write a function/method that can transform it.</description>

<p>I think you’re barking up the wrong tree with simd though, I doubt you’re gonna get much of a speedup for an rs server where the bottlenecks are going to be io not being able to crunch a shitload of data in one instruction.</p>

</aside>
<p>Run a profiler on every source just to prove the point? I have nothing wrong with replacing code with something more efficient. People have profiled the servers before - found that a majority of the processing time was spent in process(). That was because most of the code was there.</p>
<p>The servers rely on 200+ concurrent threads sharing 4 cores. [2000+ for a fully operational one…]<br>
additionally 1 for connection, and 1 for the processing.<br>
The other issue here is the processing thread is competing for the time on the CPU.</p>
<p>The new design would consist of a single logic thread - this thread would issue jobs to worker threads. Those threads do what they are told and then go idle again, no longer needing to be processed.<br>
The modern processors are built around SIMD concept. Making them really efficient at doing the same operation over and over. When you supply them the information they need in chunks, they make the most of their potential.</p>
<p>To me - it is okay if the code is shit to start with. The difference is this design allows for high cohesion and loose coupling of data - making it very simple to update. Current servers are so interconnected it is nearly impossible to multi-thread them.</p>
<p>The code that is there now is good as a reference for stuff to add - but it will be added in a different way.</p>
<p>I plan on having multithreading be a huge role in this.<br>
While some systems are being processed - a background thread will be doing lookups on event information for later execution. So by the time the logic thread reaches the handles for event systems it already has the data - preventing the nasty nested if else blocks and/or switch statement parsing.</p>

This will drastically increase the speed of the processing by cutting back the cold cache hits on every player process.<br>
Also it is a great learning experience for everyone (:</p>
<p>The main change would be instead of processing player by player; You process subsystem by subsystem.</p>

<p>So you want to create a base with bottom-up design of a 317 server? The basic IO of it isn’t hard, but creating a nice EFFICIENT server, is not a very easy task. Make sure you really study up on packet handling and buffers in general, as well as security issues that can come with how you handle different I/O operations. Why do you want to create the server from scratch, anyways?</p>
