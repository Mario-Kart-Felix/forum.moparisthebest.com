<p>Each day I write what I feel like writing without planning it out and each week change what it’s about. I just finished the first week - which was quite boring in my opinion - and I felt like I’d share to get some feedback. My vocabulary is kinda limited because I’m not around people who use fancy words often and I didn’t pay attention in school when vocabulary lessons came around, so you’re stuck with again, mediocre word choice most of the time.</p>
<p>Feel free to talk about what you think will happen or should happen. The introduction was just supposed to be a bit of background stuff before the real story takes place, so like most stories it’s not super interesting.</p>
<p>Also it’s worth noting a lot of detail was left out to make the reader picture things themselves. All of the posts were supposed to be left on sort of cliffhanger to make the reader come back the next day, and then not really paying a whole lot of attention to what the last post was about.</p>

        <p>I know you left detail out on purpose but adding more detail adds depth etc. A lot of the time the reader likes to be told what to think and then they like to imagine it in their own way. What’s going to happen should be decided early on. That’s just my two cents though.<br>
So far it’s not my type of reading material (not sure what to call it as of course it’s only a start).<br>
My big bit of advice from my perspective is build on what you’ve already got, bring all your writing together and then continue on.<br>
Good luck with this, I hope you go far with it :).</p>

        <p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:7, topic:480127”]I know you left detail out on purpose but adding more detail adds depth etc. A lot of the time the reader likes to be told what to think and then they like to imagine it in their own way. What’s going to happen should be decided early on. That’s just my two cents though.<br>
So far it’s not my type of reading material (not sure what to call it as of course it’s only a start).<br>
My big bit of advice from my perspective is build on what you’ve already got, bring all your writing together and then continue on.<br>
Good luck with this, I hope you go far with it :).[/quote]You’re absolutely right. Rather than rewrite what I just wrote elsewhere, I’ll just quote it here.</p>
<blockquote>I realized today that writing a full story is a lot harder than it seems. About a week ago I sat down with the intent of writing a full story bit-by-bit every single day without pre-writing or any sort of planning and changing the story up weekly to make it more interesting. Eventually it started feeling forced, and even though I only wrote 8 parts, it's not heading in the direction I want it to and I realized it's impossible to write something worth reading without providing a great amount of detail, which means putting forth a great deal of time, writing when motivated and feeling creative, and expanding my vocabulary and practicing that sort of stuff. So, after some great consideration, I'm calling quits on this one (for now). If I ever want to write a full story I better start with smaller ones and actually try using the words I'm supposed to learn in English class! For those of you interested in reading what I wrote, here is the link, and to those who did, you have my most sincere gratitude. http://theirworldtous.tumblr.com/</blockquote>
