    <title>RsBuddy is hacking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsbuddy-is-hacking/399027</link>
    <description>3 of my irl friends use Rsbuddy (none live together), and all of their accounts have been hacked. Just watch what scripts you guys use, and if its not widely used don&#39;t use it. Unlike Rsbot when you&#39;d add scripts manually, this is a lot more sketchy. I wouldn&#39;t trust it.

There are plenty of free bots that are good.  RSBuddy, Simba, SCAR isn’t the greatest (especially compared to Simba), but it still works.</p>

They would do that, but as Davidi said, they want certain scripts to be able to do things like that (scripts you have to pay for, trusted scripts that want to collect usage data, etc).</p>

So in other words, they don’t block people using Account.getPassword() or other things that could be malicious, they check to see how that code is used and if there would be a possibility of it being used maliciously.</p>

Either way, they have steps in place to prevent malicious code (which ultimately would most likely steal Runescape credentials). And you must remember, the individuals who make the scripts are either kids or older individuals looking to make a few dollars (or thousands in iDung’s case).</p>

<p>I agree. I’ve been using RSBuddy for a year now and I’ve got so much 99’s from it without getting hacked or banned amazingly.</p>
<p>Although when I first started botting with PowerBot I did get hacked.</p>

Scripts are examined before being accepted, any code that could be malicious is flagged and then examined individually. <span class="bbcode-b">IF</span> it was in fact RSBuddy, you’ll need to figure out which script(s) your three friends have been using in common, and then report them so it can be taken care of and prevented from happening again.

What about updates for certain scripts, I’m sure a person like Jacmob just glances over the scripts quickly.[/quote]That would also be flagged, and isn’t allowed.  And it isn’t Jacmob that does it, it’s someone called NoEffex, whose entire job is just approving scripts.</p>

<p>That’s entirely false.  They can do many different things to steal your password, even if you don’t ‘enter it into their applet’.  Some right off the top of my head would be to use reflection to grab the password right out of the runescape client, or install a keylogger to steal your password.</p>
