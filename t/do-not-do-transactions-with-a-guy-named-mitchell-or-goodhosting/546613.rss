    <title>Do not do transactions with a guy named mitchell or goodhosting</title>

    <description>There&#39;s a guy named Mitchell doing &quot;private transactions&quot; for VPS hosting. I knew him from before so I bought a VPS 1GB from him. First few days of it were fine, but then the server started lagging unnecessarily. He said everything was running fine so I took his word for it and found ways to cut down on server load. Still lagging. Worse and worse each day until my players quit and my server was left to crumble to crap. I asked him to fix the problem because it was definitely not a server based issue. He did absolutely nothing and his replies were about a day apart for each. Then I sold my laptop and bought a new PC so I was offline for about 3 days before the new PC came in the mail. All booted up I go to check on my server and it turns out it&#39;s been offline since about the same time I sold my laptop, and I was unaware that my server had been offline this whole time! This was supposed to be a 99% uptime VPS so I was confused and confronted Mitchell about the problem. Or I would have, but he wouldn&#39;t reply. Two days later he tells me the server is running just fine. I tell him I can&#39;t even connect to the Remote Desktop and he investigates the issue. Another 3 days of me wondering what the hell is going on with my PAID service, and he finally tells me that there was a Server crash at the VPS company that he was routing me through (GoodHosting). Not to mention GoodHosting took 2-3 days on top of all that other time just to respond to his ticket. At this point I just want a refund. But Mitchell makes up his own terms and conditions on the spot and his first statement is &quot;A refund is only made when there are technical issues with the VPS&quot;....so after the technical issues I tell him i want a refund again, suddenly &quot;Refunds are only made when the technical issues cause a downtime longer than 30 days.&quot; I ask him where this was written or agreed upon and he pulls the bullshit card of &quot;It was a private sale. Terms do not have to be posted. These are my terms.&quot;

TL;DR Mitchell and GoodHosting are scam-artists.</description>

<p>AND THIS WOULD BE WHY.<br>
Of the many reasons you could have behind adding a market to forums, this thread would be why a lot of people don’t like having it.<br>
No one wants to sit here and deal with all the scams, whether they be a false report or not.<br>
And no one wants to deal with threads like this, where people say generally what OP said.</p>

<p>I know but as I mentioned, I knew him from before I knew that he owned his own VPS business and he used to seem pretty cool, and we used to even talk about random shit so I figured he was friendly and then like 6 months later is when all this happened cause I had quit RSPS for a while then decided to get back into it and since i’d done business with him before and it went over nicely I figured i’d look to him for an affordable VPS but he didn’t even remember me and now he’s decided to be a dick.[/quote]<br>
So was it an actual business? Because anyone can become a reseller, but you need to pay and do things to be an actual business, and if he did own an actual one, you can report it to the Better Business Bureau. If not a real business, and if he did not have any form of reputation your loss.<br>
Seriously, have you heard of a search engine called google? It can get you plenty of results on a person, or a business/website. It’s helpful to get some reviews if you don’t trust the person. No matter how long you’ve known em.</p>
<p>And just because you know him over the internet, doesn’t mean you really know him. Anyone can have an alias… Plenty of people have loads of them, for scamming and etc… I was talking to someone for 3 years, and he didn’t even know how old I was (Best part: I met him on this website, AND my age is on my profile).</p>

              <p>There’s a guy named Mitchell doing “private transactions” for VPS hosting. I knew him from before so I bought a VPS 1GB from him. First few days of it were fine, but then the server started lagging unnecessarily. He said everything was running fine so I took his word for it and found ways to cut down on server load. Still lagging. Worse and worse each day until my players quit and my server was left to crumble to crap. I asked him to fix the problem because it was definitely not a server based issue. He did absolutely nothing and his replies were about a day apart for each. Then I sold my laptop and bought a new PC so I was offline for about 3 days before the new PC came in the mail. All booted up I go to check on my server and it turns out it’s been offline since about the same time I sold my laptop, and I was unaware that my server had been offline this whole time! This was supposed to be a 99% uptime VPS so I was confused and confronted Mitchell about the problem. Or I would have, but he wouldn’t reply. Two days later he tells me the server is running just fine. I tell him I can’t even connect to the Remote Desktop and he investigates the issue. Another 3 days of me wondering what the hell is going on with my PAID service, and he finally tells me that there was a Server crash at the VPS company that he was routing me through (GoodHosting). Not to mention GoodHosting took 2-3 days on top of all that other time just to respond to his ticket. At this point I just want a refund. But Mitchell makes up his own terms and conditions on the spot and his first statement is “A refund is only made when there are technical issues with the VPS”…so after the technical issues I tell him i want a refund again, suddenly “Refunds are only made when the technical issues cause a downtime longer than 30 days.” I ask him where this was written or agreed upon and he pulls the bullshit card of “It was a private sale. Terms do not have to be posted. These are my terms.”</p>
<p>TL;DR Mitchell and GoodHosting are scam-artists.</p>
