<p>There is no way a plane hit that, the hole was way too small for a plane, you can’t argue that the wings broke off because windows on either side of the hole was intact. Also because if a jet plane really flew that low over the highway, the cars would have been thrown from the force, had to have been a military plane.</p>

A physics expert named Steven Jones did extensive research and he talked to many demoltions experts Mopman.  If you have time to watch this two hour lecture by him on why phsyics prove that 9/11 was an inside job.<br>

<p>It’s also weakened by a fucking massive plane going through it, dickhead. No one is saying that the steel was burnt and then the building collapsed…</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Oh Congrats. Btw; the report said that the steel melted and then it collapsed. So a plane weakened it. It was designed to shift weight onto the other braces. If anything the top part of where it was hit would have crunched and then fell over to the side. Not straight down like a demoltion. Dickhead.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The planes weight brought it down. Anyway this is old and I really hope this thread dies soon. Because I’m sick and tired of hearing people trying to say that the Twin Towers were demolished on purpose… Why would people want them demolished? How would they know when to set up the demolition if they didn’t know terrorists would strike? How would they set it up without people noticing? If they did know terrorists were going to strike wouldn’t it have looked better for the American Goverment to have stopped them then let them hit the buildings then launch a war on terror?</p>
<p>Anyway I have a headache so I’m done posting here.[/quote]<br>
Do you know anything about America’s history? Apparently Not. We did it to sway public opinion and congress for the invasion into Iraq. Civil War, Abraham Lincoln lied and said that the fort in the southern territory was attacked upprovoked. They were in the south territory. World War 2, Franklin Roosevelt claimed that american passengers on a british carrier were attacked unprovoked and in fact the carrier was carrying American Ammuntion and American Weapons. Vietnam War; we claimed that we we’re attacked unprovoked by the North Vietnam troops and that we we’re attacked twice. Years later we discovered that it was all lies in the pentagon papers and that we were in North Vietnam waters attacking the mainland and unloading south vietnam troops into North Vietnam. We did it to sway public opinion for the war. We have a history to believe it and it’s not unplausiable.</p>

Although the steel loses 50% of it’s “melting defense” at like 3000 degrees that airplane fuel wouldn’t have been able to sustain that type of heat for a long enough period of time to burn the steel. Furthermore, The FBI floors of building seven had been completley destroyed before it fell. It also fell in 6.6 seconds( BYU Professor Steven Jones calcualated) and it fell just like a controlled demoltion would if Thermite was used. That good for you mopman?</p>

<p>It’s also weakened by a fucking massive plane going through it, dickhead. No one is saying that the steel was burnt and then the building collapsed…<br>

Oh Congrats. Btw; the report said that the steel melted and then it collapsed. So a plane weakened it. It was designed to shift weight onto the other braces. If anything the top part of where it was hit would have crunched and then fell over to the side. Not straight down like a demoltion. Dickhead.[/quote]</p>
<p>The planes weight brought it down. Anyway this is old and I really hope this thread dies soon. Because I’m sick and tired of hearing people trying to say that the Twin Towers were demolished on purpose… Why would people want them demolished? How would they know when to set up the demolition if they didn’t know terrorists would strike? How would they set it up without people noticing? If they did know terrorists were going to strike wouldn’t it have looked better for the American Goverment to have stopped them then let them hit the buildings then launch a war on terror?</p>
<p>Anyway I have a headache so I’m done posting here.</p>

<p>You seem to have forgotten, on top of all this, a fucking massive plane flew into the building at top speeds? No one is saying the steel got burnt and the building collapsed. The force of the plane going into the building was enough to make it collapse. Also once the plane was in there would have been extra weight, also helping it to collapse. So shut up and maybe try not copying and pasting senseless peoples conspiracy theories off the internet?</p>

              <p>I’ve known the whole thing was a hoax for about 2 years now. My dad’s friend gave me a 5 hour long DVD explaining why nothing added up.
