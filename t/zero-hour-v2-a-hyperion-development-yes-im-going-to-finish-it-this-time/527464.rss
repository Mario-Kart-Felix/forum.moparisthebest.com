    <description>[b]About This Project:[/b] Yes, this is Tyb97 and I&#39;m going to continue on with the Zero Hour development with what free time I&#39;ll have with the upcoming months, I don&#39;t intend on hosting this but release is what I&#39;m probably gonna end up doing, this is a &#39;just for fun&#39; project, since my last rush project didn&#39;t go so well. I&#39;m going to update it occasionally, but not on any gauged basis just because I may not have an update every day or so.

[b]What I&#39;m Going For:[/b] Well, I&#39;m just going for a fully functional server base for a planned release. The final product will feature a fully documented, simplified version of Hyperion, with all skills and combat and everything for people to hopefully use. 

[b]Last Update:[/b] 8/6/13

[center][size=24pt]Zero Hour[/size][/center]

[size=18pt]Combat[/size]

[ul][li][b]About:[/b] Zero Hour&#39;s combat is a take on the same system, with a few twists. So far these are the main points of combat:[/li]
[list]
[li]Melee:[/li]
[list]
[li]Health affects your ability to hit/miss, the less health you have the less you will hit, so keep eating or you may be too worn out to strike your opponent.[/li]
[li]Body parts, based on your opponents defense, you may strike towards his torso, legs, arms, head, or waist. Now, what armor you are wearing is a big modifier, I could attempt to strike you in the head with a bronze scimitar, and you are wearing a dragon med helm, well, my attack and strength is greater than your defense, but your head armor is better, so I wouldn&#39;t hit as hard on the head as I usually would. However, the torso would actually cause a bigger hit than the head if the opponent was wearing no body armor.[/li]
[li]The slayer skill modifies the above, a player with a high slayer skill would notice what the other player is wearing, and decide what place is best to aim for.[/li]
[/list]
[li]Range:[/li]
[list]
[li]HP still effects combat like in melee.[/li]
[li]More coming soon.[/li]
[/list]
[li]Magic:[/li]
[list]
[li]HP still effects combat like in melee.[/li]
[li]Elemental spells actually have elemental affects. Explanation: I&#39;m gonna make this short, fire will melt and have a chance of degrading the opposing players metal type armor, based on the attackers magic level, and the others defense level. Fire spells will also possibly roast players bows, arrows in their quiver, staves and cloth. Water spells have a chance of rotting wooden items such as staves and bows, and rusting metal, this won&#39;t damage the players like fire will, but it could also degrade their armor. Air spells can make players lose runes in their pouches, or arrows in their quivers, and earth spells could slam players to the ground hard, leaving the attacker time to run away, and damage the other player.[/li]
[/list]
[/list]
[li][b]Other Notes:[/b] Some of this may seem very OP, but I&#39;m working to even things out. It also seems like these things will take thought an much attention, but it will follow the same easy click and watch philosophy. This will also work for NPC combat, I&#39;ll just have to add details like armor and stuff for each NPC, which I&#39;ll do over time.[/li][/ul]


I&#39;d post more ideas but, that&#39;s all I got at the moment.

Not really, if you see how come wL updating is done with the objects and such, in certain conditions some players will see the door as closed, and not be able to go through it, and some will see it as opened. This system prevents against that. Your idea is exactly what I’m doing, you just don’t compensate for how the region loading works with the RS2 protocol.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">About This Project:</span> Yes, this is Tyb97 and I’m going to continue on with the Zero Hour development with what free time I’ll have with the upcoming months, I don’t intend on hosting this but release is what I’m probably gonna end up doing, this is a ‘just for fun’ project, since my last rush project didn’t go so well. I’m going to update it occasionally, but not on any gauged basis just because I may not have an update every day or so.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What I’m Going For:</span> Well, I’m just going for a fully functional server base for a planned release. The final product will feature a fully documented, simplified version of Hyperion, with all skills and combat and everything for people to hopefully use.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Last Update:</span> 8/6/13</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>[center][size=24pt]Zero Hour[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[size=18pt]Combat[/size]</p>
<p>[ul][li]<span class="bbcode-b">About:</span> Zero Hour’s combat is a take on the same system, with a few twists. So far these are the main points of combat:[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Melee:[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]Health affects your ability to hit/miss, the less health you have the less you will hit, so keep eating or you may be too worn out to strike your opponent.[/li]<br>
[li]Body parts, based on your opponents defense, you may strike towards his torso, legs, arms, head, or waist. Now, what armor you are wearing is a big modifier, I could attempt to strike you in the head with a bronze scimitar, and you are wearing a dragon med helm, well, my attack and strength is greater than your defense, but your head armor is better, so I wouldn’t hit as hard on the head as I usually would. However, the torso would actually cause a bigger hit than the head if the opponent was wearing no body armor.[/li]<br>
[li]The slayer skill modifies the above, a player with a high slayer skill would notice what the other player is wearing, and decide what place is best to aim for.[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Range:[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]HP still effects combat like in melee.[/li]<br>
[li]More coming soon.[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]Magic:[/li]<br>
[list]<br>
[li]HP still effects combat like in melee.[/li]<br>
[li]Elemental spells actually have elemental affects. Explanation: I’m gonna make this short, fire will melt and have a chance of degrading the opposing players metal type armor, based on the attackers magic level, and the others defense level. Fire spells will also possibly roast players bows, arrows in their quiver, staves and cloth. Water spells have a chance of rotting wooden items such as staves and bows, and rusting metal, this won’t damage the players like fire will, but it could also degrade their armor. Air spells can make players lose runes in their pouches, or arrows in their quivers, and earth spells could slam players to the ground hard, leaving the attacker time to run away, and damage the other player.[/li]<br>
[/list]<br>
[/list]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-b">Other Notes:</span> Some of this may seem very OP, but I’m working to even things out. It also seems like these things will take thought an much attention, but it will follow the same easy click and watch philosophy. This will also work for NPC combat, I’ll just have to add details like armor and stuff for each NPC, which I’ll do over time.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>I’d post more ideas but, that’s all I got at the moment.</p>

<p>Well that’s all for now, comments, constructive criticism, creative ideas, and questions, all welcome.</p>
<p>I’ll make a change log for things after this post for quick viewing. Oh and, going outta town so don’t expect much from now until Saturday.</p>
