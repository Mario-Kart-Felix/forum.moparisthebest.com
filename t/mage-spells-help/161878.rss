    <description>Problem 1: When I get an staff and all the runes, I go to choose a Regular spell. I click on it, but it doesnt do anything ive clicked on everyone of them. Nothing Happens. But when I click choose set (Ancient magic) I can click on any spell and it will choose it to keep using it when i click on a npc. But not for regular magic, any help?  :confused:

Problem 2: When I choose an ancient spell to use over and over again, it will do it. But for multi-target spells it only does it to one of the npcs i click on. But when I do ::switch to ancient magic in my spellbook, when i click it, it says I need an ancient staff. So i got the staff, when I chose an spell and clicked on an npc it hurts people around it like its supposed to. But not when I choose it to do it over and over.  :confused:

I would LOVE for some1 to atleast give an answer to one of my problems. =P Thanks.</description>
