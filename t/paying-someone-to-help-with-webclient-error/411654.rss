    <title>Paying someone to help with Webclient error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-someone-to-help-with-webclient-error/411654</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m willing to pay someone (not just some random) who has experience and can create a webclient for me. The source and client is from InsidiaX because my friend and I are buying out that server and the problem we are having is the god forsaken webclient. There is always an error that I get, and it&#39;s the same error every time. I talked to the Client maker and webclient maker (who already has a working webclient) and his is working fine, he tried to help me through the problem and nothing worked.

I jarred it and signed it exactly like he did and yet, his still works (even on my website I use), and mine doesn&#39;t. I always get this error:

Something about the main class cannot be found? I include all of the files, excluding the ones you aren&#39;t supposed to include (cache) when I jar it and I make sure the client.class is in there.

If someone knows what to do about this and can explain to me the problem, I will pay them to fix it for me...
Contact me please:
MSN: cctrain13@hotmail.com
Skype: blood_veins

Thanks.

Also, the original webclient/client creator told me that the problem was my jdk version? I tried like 5 different versions of it, between jdk6.1.0_21 to jdk7.1.0 and none of those worked.</description>
