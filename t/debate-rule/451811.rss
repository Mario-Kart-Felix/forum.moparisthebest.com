    <description>Please ban all religious arguments from the debate board unless they actually have factual proof and it isn&#39;t all based upon opinion. I see people just trying to edge other members on with some of the title names I&#39;ve seen. It just offends people. Especially the people who have to witness the amount of crap piling up in each topic -.-</description>

              <p>Religion always has been and always will be a hot debate topic. Similar to gun control, abortion, and same sex marriage, many opinions are simply based on a persons own limited viewpoint, and that’s the point of the section. If you think someone is being stupid or just posting opinion without any ‘proof’ (which is a very subjective term by the way…), call them out on it. The rules are more lenient (hence, ‘debate’), so if you call someone out for being full of ‘crap’ and post your own counter proofs you will just strengthen your stance.</p>
<p>Just remember - you may not be able to change the mind of the person you are arguing with (as humans are just stubborn that way), but third parties are much more susceptible to good evidence and arguments so you may convince others anyways</p>
