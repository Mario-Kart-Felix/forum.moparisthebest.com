    <description>The max hit is 100 with the best armor, this man was maxing around 200+ so i would like a list of all the moparscape codes that can make you max hit so far i only know 1, ::maxhit but i know that not what was causing the problem because i tried it and it did not allow me to hit like this guy was, so please any codes would be helpfull!

and before anyone else asks it WAS NOT a p-ring OR a p-neckalce their bonuses have been disabled and a mod went onto his acc and didnt find anything whered he WAS USING CHEATS, i have bolth p-ring and p-necklace niether give bonuses, again A MOD WAS ON HIS ACC AND FOUND NOTHING OF WEIRD ITEMS!
