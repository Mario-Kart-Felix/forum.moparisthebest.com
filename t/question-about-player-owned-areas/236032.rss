    <title>~Question about Player Owned Areas~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-player-owned-areas/236032</link>
    <description>Hey, on my server I&#39;m trying to start something called Player Owned Areas...
The purpose for this is mainly for Player Clans... So, what I&#39;m trying to do is make it to where theres an Npc in certain areas and if you have the right ammount of money for one area then you can buy that area. The proof of purchase is different objects depending on where the area is (i.e. You buy an area in Edgeville, the token for that is a castle wars ticket). When you have that token/proof of purchase, you&#39;re allowed to change the name of that area... So what you do is type in ::namemyplace (NAME) and then any npc that talks about that area will call it that name (i.e. if you type ::namemyplace PimpTown, all of the npcs that origianlly talked about Edgeville will now call it PimpTown). So now what you would do is now that you own that token, you own that area. Also when you enter that area, the name shows up in the right hand corner of the screen (like the wilderness meter). So what happens if you want to sell that area? Well if someone wants to buy it, you trade that person and they get the token... You can only change the name of the place if you have that places token!
So what&#39;s my question? Well I&#39;m having trouble with the area zones... I cant seem to figure out the best method for making the player owned areas... Can someone help me out here?</description>

              <p>probably the same as boundaries for the wildy except make them have different properties, like if another clan comes in that isn’t friendly they can fight eachother, that’s what comes to mind at the moment</p>
