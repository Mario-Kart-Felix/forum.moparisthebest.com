    <title>Need some serious help please.. This is extremely weird shit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-serious-help-please-this-is-extremely-weird-shit/434532</link>
    <description>Ok so i started to make a private server 2 days ago and it was fine but about after 20 minutes after running it i started to get nulled by an ip. So i banned the ip but it still came through. I added anti null/syi (1 connection per ip) and they STILL came in. So i downloaded other sources with anti null (PI,ETC) And STILL nulls.
So then i decided to make a whole new server today so i deleted that old no-ip adress and made a whole new forums source and everything added grahams anti null and everything. so i started it up and all ran fine but then again after 20 minutes here comes the nulls!

I looked up the ip on google and clicked a website and it was some ip tracker site and the comments on the ip said &quot;this guys name is spike 2147 and he is trouble&quot; so im wondering if someone is actually in my network or something?
I need help asap not just to make a server but because this could be a serious secruity problem

Here is the ip
74.115.3.62

If this is an actual person i really wish i could find them and bust the shit out of there computer.
I have a feeling it is a security problem because i banned the IP from my computer not just the server. And plus who nulls a server for almost 4 days straight?
Please help
ALSO the null blocker says its blocking but it still adds like 400 players to the server and crashes. I really just wana start up this server but i cant until this is fixed=\
