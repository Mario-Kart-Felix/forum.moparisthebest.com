    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bug-the-hell-out-of-people-with-microsoft-word-great-for-school/10555</link>
    <description>This is garanteed (sp?) to annoy someone using microsoft Word!!!!

1. Open Microsoft Word
2. If theres not already an open, blank document go to file -&gt; new
3. Type in random letters such as [code]slekfjasld[/code]
4. It now should be underlined with a red squigly thing
5. Put your mouse on the red squigly thing
6. It should now look like this:[img]http://img246.imageshack.us/img246/1148/tutvy7.png[/img]
7. Put your mouse over the little blue box thing
8. click on the little arrow thing so it should look like this: [img]http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6843/tutvr6.png[/img]
9. Click on the highlighted thing on the picture above.
10. Where it says &quot;replace&quot; type in the word the and where it says &quot;with&quot; write Omg im a 1337 h4x0r!! or VIRUS VIRUS RESTART COMPUTER!
11. Press ok, or accept or whatever it says
12. type the word the
13. press the space bar
14. Now wait for someone to go on that computer and use microsoft word and type the word &quot;the&quot; and watch em go psycho :P
