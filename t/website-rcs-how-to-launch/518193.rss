    <title>Website rcs how to launch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/website-rcs-how-to-launch/518193</link>
    <description>So ruby gave me the download and i downloaded it. It was all good after some difficulties with the zip and now i have all these files &quot;admins, forums etc. Also some a php, which i have no idea what they are. 

The whole point of downloading this was to have a website theme like old runescape i.e. 2007 and 2006scape. So now i have the download, how do i install it? Is there a file or something else?</description>
