    <title>Finding the right JDK for YOUR compiler/path/classpath</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/finding-the-right-jdk-for-your-compiler-path-classpath/456656</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve noticed WAY too many people having problems finding their JDK so they can compile whatever source they need to compile. My first recommendation is getting an [url=http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/junor]IDE[/url]; you do NOT have to compile with an IDE, when you run the program it will compile. You can find more information about Eclispe with [url=http://google.com]Google[/url].

If that just doesn&#39;t fly, then you need to edit your compiler/path/classpath and replace that crappy jdk version that doesn&#39;t work with the one that [i]does[/i] work.

For Windows XP 32 (x86) Bit users:
• go to Start (bottom left)&gt;My Computer&gt;Local Disk (C:/)&gt;Program Files (x86)&gt;Java

For Windows XP 64 Bit users:
• go to Start (bottom left)&gt;My Computer&gt;Local Disk (C:/)&gt;Program Files&gt;Java

For Windows Vista/7 users:
• go to start (bottom right)&gt;search &quot;Java&quot;&gt;go to the folder &quot;Java&quot;&gt;find the jdk folder

Now look at this picture, the &quot;circled&quot; folder is what you will replace in your .bat program.
So if you have &quot;jdk1.6.0_05&quot; set as your classpath/path/in your compiler replace it with EXACTLY the one that is shown in your folder. (For example, only I would replace jdk1.6.0_05 with jdk1.7.0_05, because jdk1.7.0_05 is the version I have, not you.)

So, what did that do? Well, you found out your jdk version (whatever the folder was called) and now go back to your compiler/path/classpath and change it accordingly.

Any questions post here, I will [b]not[/b] answer non-related jdk issues, and I will not do it for you.</description>
