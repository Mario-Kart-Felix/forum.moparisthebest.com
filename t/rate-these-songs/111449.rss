[b]i poon you[/b]
[code]I poon you from england to Japan,
With my Pking Clan,
you see me in wildy with an abyssal whip,
now you&#39;re gone on a mutha fuckin trip,
you land back in Lumby with three peices of stuff,
You Pm me back saying &quot;That&#39;s Enough&quot;
I say &quot;Bring a Clan I still poon you&quot;
So you said &quot;yea I know that&#39;s true&quot;
You bring a clan, we start a fit,
now this goes on in another skit.(repeat skit 2x)


The skit has started and We killed 5 of your men,
Oh wait never mind now it&#39;s ten,
You teleport away like a little noob.
Now this goes on in another skit. (repeat skit 2x)


I find you in Varrock walking to edgeville,
Autoeing to me in red writing &quot;you&#39;re to hard to kill&quot;,
So you go to Edgeville and kill a low Level kid,
And now Ima about to poon you like old times,
So I start a to give you shit,
and this goes on in another skit. (repeat skit 2x)


This is the last skit,
you&#39;re scared as shit.
I know you wanna teleport,
But you ran out of runes,
So now I do a snare,
and you say &quot;that&#39;s not fair!&quot;
I hit a 22 with my abyssal whip,
and you start giving me lip,
I finish you off with a 30-32 with my dds,
and you start to cry,
as the reaper comes i write bye,
and pm you saying lost all your shit,
so you give me shit,
now that&#39;s the end of this fit. (repeat fit 3x)

[b]stereotypical gangsta[/b]
[code]Light up that dro,
cuz ima bout to smoke on the show,
we be smellin some insents in the back,
and sniffin up some crack crack crack,
later we be rollin on dubs,
hitting in the clubs,
get a hit,
smell that shit,
drink some wine,
oh shit it&#39;s about time,
need to go bust a cap,
then i need to take a nap.


Aww Yea
lets take a trip
just sit back and light a spliff 
with this and dont slip
on a funky dope track
jump back
strapped with the fat buddha sac
and a &#39;78 lac
oh clean
gangsta lean 
i got greens
go serve some fiends,
light some dope,
give it to the pope,
touch it,
kiss it,
please it girl,
jump up and down,
and make that ass twirl.


Keep pumpin
ain&#39;t worried bout nuttin
Busters thought we was frontin
so reload and keep dumpin
dump on fools with a quickness
and they got no cure for this sickness


Ready here he come
Gotta sick ven-detta
To get this che-dda
wit my Ba-Retta
The dra-ma-setta
Sip Am-a-retta
My flow sounds betta
Than average
On tracks Im a savage
I damage
the streets are filled with red,
because all those bitches are dead,
I love my females strapped
then fuck em from the back
I get my currency in stacks
Californias where I&#39;m at.
[/code]

[b]the shit[/b]
[code]Verse 1: kyle

I&#39;m like tupac all eyez on me,
smokin crack every verse of ki,
ridin to the club,
smokin some shrub,
partyin like a rockstar,
chillin in my hot car,
goin on the streets with my gun,
killin people, just for fun.
crip walkin across the state,
wishin not to die, that&#39;s my fate.
sellin those drugs,
poppin those bugs...


Came back from the dead to address the beef 
Kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat 
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak 
Thats when I go bishop and juice and start flexin heat


Verse 2: (kyle and tom)
See me ridin through cali in the roles phantom double doo&#39; (door),
make these bitches get horny and beatin like a congo,
drop the top,
in the candy red flip flop,
tradin glocks for MP5&#39;s,
and tradin my daggers for swiss army knives,
going to go for a killin spree,
they can only live if they pay a large fee,
so I killed a few,
now a lot,
now I feel like smokin some pot,
a guy talks to me and says &quot;let me teach you how to stunt&quot;
teach me how to stunt? you need to let me teach you how to roll a flat blunt,


Came back from the dead to address the beef 
Kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat 
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak 
Thats when I go bishop and juice and start flexin heat


Verse 3: (tom)
Yea man,
it&#39;s tom,
best freestyler, after lil flip,
I have beat a nigga, and a nip,
those lil nips are such pussies,
they go back home and kiss their mom&#39;s tushies,
when they see me with my glock eight teen, (18)
they run like bitches, and run for home coming queen,
but those niggas are tough,
I think they have, a lil to much to puff,
because their chillin, makes them rough,
they can afford guns, but on welfare,
you know what, they can&#39;t afford a chair,
but they don&#39;t even care,
just as long as they kill,
it will give them a thrill,
and make them do more,
but I put a stop to their shit,
yea that&#39;s right, I put up a fit,
I pop their head,
uh oh, now they&#39;re dead.


Came back from the dead to address the beef 
Kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat 
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak 
Thats when I go bishop and juice and start flexin heat

(chorus ti&#39;ll fade)

              <p>K here is a non rap song by Crass. Im horrible at making lyrics so I decided to use someone elses</p>
<p>[code]“Big A, Little A”</p>
<p>Big A, little A, bouncing B<br>
The system might have got you but it won’t get me</p>
<p>1 - 2 - 3 - 4</p>
<p>External control are you gonna let them get you?<br>
Do you wanna be a prisoner in the boundaries they set you?<br>
You say you want to ba yourself, by christ do you think they’ll let you?<br>
They’re out to get you get you get you get you get you get you get you</p>
<p>Hello, hello, hello, this is the Lord God, can you hear?<br>
Hellfire and damnation’s what I’ve got for you down there<br>
On earth I have ambassadors, archbishop, vicar, pope<br>
We’ll blind you with morality, you’d best abandon any hope,<br>
We’re telling you you’d better pray cos you were born in sin<br>
Right from the start we’ll build a cell and then we’ll lock you in<br>
We sit in holy judgement condemning those that stray<br>
We offer our forgiveness, but first we’ll make you pay</p>
<p>External control are you gonna let them get you?<br>
Do you wanna be a prisoner in the boundaries they set you?<br>
You say you want to be yourself, by christ do you think they’ll let you?<br>
They’re out to get you get you get you get you get you get you get you</p>
<p>Hello, hello, hello, now here’s a massage from your queen<br>
As figurehead of the status quo I set the social scene<br>
I’m most concerned about my people, I want to give them peace<br>
So I’m making sure they stay in line with my army and police<br>
My prisons and my mental homes have ever open doors<br>
For those amongst my subjects who dare to ask for more<br>
Unruliness and disrespect are things I can’t allow<br>
So I’ll see the peasants grovel if they refuse to bow</p>
<p>External control are you gonna let them get you?<br>
Do you wanna be a prisoner in the boundaries they set you?<br>
You say you want to be yourself, by christ do you think they’ll let you?<br>
They’re out to get you get you get you get you get you get you get you</p>
<p>Introducing the Prime Sinister, she’s a mother to us all<br>
Like the dutch boy’s finger in the dyke her arse is in the wall<br>
Holding back the future waiting for the seas to part<br>
If Moses did it with is faith, she’ll do it with an army<br>
Who at times of threatened crisis are certain to be there<br>
Guarding national heritage no matter what or where<br>
Palaces for kings and queens, mansions for the rich<br>
Protection for the wealthy, defence of privilege<br>
They’ve learnt the ropes In Ireland, engaged in civil war<br>
Fighting for the ruling classes in their battle against the poor<br>
So Ireland’s just an island? It’s an island of the mind<br>
Great Britain? Future? Bollocks, you’d better look behind<br>
Round every other corner stands P.C. 1984<br>
Guardian of the future, he’ll implement the law<br>
He’s there as a grim reminder that no matter what you do<br>
Big brothers system’s always there with his beady eyes on you<br>
From God to local bobby, in home and street and school<br>
They’ve got your name and number while you’ve just got their rule<br>
We’ve got to look for methods to undermine those powers<br>
It’s time to change the tables. The future must be ours</p>
<p>Big A, little A, bouncing B<br>
The system might have got you but it won’t get me</p>
<p>Be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do<br>
I am he and she is she but you’re the only you<br>
No one else has got your eyes, can see the things you see<br>
It’s up to you to change your life and my life’s up to me<br>
The problems that you suffer from are problems that you make<br>
The shit we have to climb through is the shit we choose to take<br>
If you don’t like the life you live, change it now it’s yours<br>
Nothing has effects if you don’t recognise the cause<br>
If the programme’s not the one you want, get up, turn off the set<br>
It’s only you that can decide what life you’re gonna get<br>
If you don’t like religion you can be the antichrist<br>
If your tired of politics you can be an anarchist<br>
But no one ever changed the church by pulling down a steeple<br>
And you’ll never change the system by bombing number ten<br>
Systems just aren’t made of bricks they’re mostly made of people<br>
You may send them into hiding, but they’ll be back again<br>
If you don’t like the rules they make, refuse to play their game<br>
If you don’t want to be a number, don’t give them your name<br>
If you don’t want to be caught out, refuse to hear their question<br>
Silence is a virtue, use it for your own protection<br>
They’ll try to make you play their game, refuse to show your face<br>
If you don’t want to be beaten down, refuse to join their race<br>
Be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do<br>
I am he and she is she but you’re they only you[/code]</p>

teach me how to stunt? you need to let me teach you how to roll a flat blunt,</p>
<p>Came back from the dead to address the beef<br>
Kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat<br>
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak<br>
Thats when I go bishop and juice and start flexin heat</p>
<p>Verse 3: (tom)<br>
Yea man,<br>
it’s tom,<br>
best freestyler, after lil flip,<br>
I have beat a nigga, and a nip,<br>
those lil nips are such pussies,<br>
they go back home and kiss their mom’s tushies,<br>
when they see me with my glock eight teen, (18)<br>
they run like bitches, and run for home coming queen,<br>
but those niggas are tough,<br>
I think they have, a lil to much to puff,<br>
because their chillin, makes them rough,<br>
they can afford guns, but on welfare,<br>
you know what, they can’t afford a chair,<br>
but they don’t even care,<br>
just as long as they kill,<br>
it will give them a thrill,<br>
and make them do more,<br>
but I put a stop to their shit,<br>
yea that’s right, I put up a fit,<br>
I pop their head,<br>
uh oh, now they’re dead.</p>
<p>Came back from the dead to address the beef<br>
Kiss my converse bitch and accept defeat<br>
Cause I hate it when bullies try to test the weak<br>
Thats when I go bishop and juice and start flexin heat</p>
<p>(chorus ti’ll fade)</p>
