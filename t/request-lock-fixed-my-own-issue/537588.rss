    <title>Request lock, fixed my own issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/request-lock-fixed-my-own-issue/537588</link>
    <description>For example, needing level 90 cooking to open a door inside the cooking guild that allows users to access the bank/stove so close.

I tried this in ObjectHandler, but honestly don&#39;t have a clue how to call it.

[code]  } else if (id == 26810) { //ID of door in cooking guild
					if (player.getSkills().getLevel(Skills.COOKING) &lt; 90) {
						player.getPackets()
						.sendGameMessage(
								&quot;You need a cooking level of 90 to enter this part of the guild.&quot;,
								true);
						return;
					}[/code]



EDIT: Sorry everyone! I got it to work, my player account was just bugged with &quot;196&quot; after I did reset and master, after it went down to below 90 it send that message. (:
