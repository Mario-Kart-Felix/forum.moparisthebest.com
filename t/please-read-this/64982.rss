    <description>Ok. Before I begin, please read [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,668.0/all.html]this[/url]. SCAR throws out a lot of errors, often when you don&#39;t do something right. We can&#39;t help you unless you provide the following information:-
The script name. The include your using, your computer specs(not always needed) and what you did before and after pressing the play button. Also, often the error can belong in the script, so it isn&#39;t your fault it&#39;s the script, in this case you should post on the script&#39;s thread. I have provided you with a template post witch you can use. This will help us help you.
