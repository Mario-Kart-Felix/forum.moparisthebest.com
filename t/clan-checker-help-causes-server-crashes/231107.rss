    <title>Clan Checker Help - Causes Server Crashes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clan-checker-help-causes-server-crashes/231107</link>
    <description>I made the following code to check whether or not 2 people are in the same clan; but it looks as though it&#39;s gonna going to work as I expected.

The code:
[code]public String clans(){
String readclans = &quot;Failed&quot;;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++){
clans[1] = &quot;CLAN 1&quot;;
clans[2] = &quot;CLAN 2&quot;;
readclans = clans[i];
}
return readclans;
}[/code]

and the part I have calling on it is:
[code]IsInClan(clans(), playerName);[/code]
the first input is the clan name to be checked, and the second is the name of the player to be checked. Because you can only put in one clan name, I&#39;m trying to create something that loops through all the clans to check them all. I know this works, because I use the
[code]for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++){
clans[1] = &quot;CLAN 1&quot;;
clans[2] = &quot;CLAN 2&quot;;[/code]
part by itself and it worked fine, but if I want to use this in more then one spot, I would have copy this code over and over again wherever it&#39;s needed, so a public String seems like the best answer.

Like I said, this attempt crashes the server and gives me:
[code]java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -29952
        at client.parseIncomingPackets(client.java:18597)
        at client.packetProcess(client.java:15661)
        at client.process(client.java:15631)
        at PlayerHandler.process(PlayerHandler.java:137)
        at server.main(server.java:47)[/code]
I checked the line, and sure enough, its the Magic On Player line; where I&#39;m trying to implement it.

Anyone know what I can do about it?
