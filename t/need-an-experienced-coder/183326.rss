    <description>Looking for an experienced coder to help me code my server! My msn is Xtgscott@hotmail.com. Help would be highly appreciated since i&#39;m taking on a big task. More coders would be appreiciated so I can get my server up and running. This server will be based on Runescape. My goals for this server is as less lag as possible, if none. Specs, all weapons, custom item ID&#39;s for the client that I will be making as well, Skillcapes, Mini-games, etc...etc... Help would be HIGHLY APPRECIATED and any coder that will help me will be givin&#39; co-owner or admin depending on how much they do help! Thanks guys!</description>

<p>Yeah well, I didn’t ask for smart ass replies did I? I’m not new. I said I do know how to code. For all you know I could be a genius at this stuff and just now joining Moparscape Forums. But I’m not. I said I knew a thing or two about coding, I’ve taught myself and all I asked for was help, not your bull shit replies dumb fuck.</p>
