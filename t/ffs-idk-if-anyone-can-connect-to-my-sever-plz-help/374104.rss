<p>Pal. people should just stick to playing other’s.</p>
<p>Here’s some alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.no-ip.com" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">www.no-ip.com</a></p>
<p>Get a no-ip put it in your client.java - Client-sided and Source - Config.</p>
<p>utorrent, This is also a simple way to see if your portforwarded.</p>
<p>-Read a guide if your that dumb not to understand utorrent</p>
<p><a href="http://www.canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.canyouseeme.org</a> - Check if your portforwarded on 43594.</p>
<p>Make sure client and source’s ip’s are correctly matched, and compiled.</p>
