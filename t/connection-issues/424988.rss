    <description>Hello all,

I am a long time user and new time server creator. I am attempting to setup my first server.

1) In windows 7 64 bit I went in and manually set the IP address and gateway so that it would remain the same upon restarts and such. 
2) I have created a NO-IP account, linked that to my IP address, downloaded the client, installed and got that running. I setup my server hostname and seems to be working fine on that part 
3) I have directed the port forwarding on my wireless router to my laptop, and set the port to 43594 on start and end. 
4) I manually changed my environment variables for java


It seems as if once I download a basic source, I can&#39;t get it connected properly. When I go in and change the 127.0.0.1 in the client to my address it does not connect? Says I have server running and I have no-ip running. Am I missing something?


(I plan on running this on my laptop over wireless for awhile till I finish my actual server....don&#39;t worry my systems good).</description>

              <p>Tried shutting firewall and antivirus off still same issue. Confuses me. I did also make sure that I had set my variables properly just in case.</p>
<p>on the other laptop of which im attempting to connect I just realized that it comes up with “connecting to 0.0.0.0 on port 43594”. I have changed the client.java file to the host address which I am using.</p>
<p>I can ping my server fine from the other laptop. I asked my friend to ping it, and said it came up with 100% lost packets?</p>

              <p>Umm, if you want to connect to your server using the same computer that is hosting the server, you aren’t supposed to change 127.0.0.1… that is the local ip, you only change the local ip when you are going to upload your client and have others play on it from an “outside” computer.</p>
