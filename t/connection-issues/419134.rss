    <title>Connection Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-issues/419134</link>
    <description>Right guys I&#39;ve been having a problem with getting other people onto my server. I&#39;m extremely new to this and would appreciate it if you answered without being patronising. So I&#39;m completely confused as to why when anyone else but me gets &#39;Error connecting to server&#39; when trying to log into my server. Under the client.java the IP is set to my no-ip and yes I&#39;ve checked my port is fully open. I&#39;ve tested it with other clients such as Moparscape.org and it lets them log in but logs them out straight away (they come up on the log too). This leads me to think it&#39;s a problem with my client, any help would be appreciated. Thank you!
