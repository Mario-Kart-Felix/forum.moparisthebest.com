    <title>Connection Issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-issues/343320</link>
    <description>Hello, I just started a server that is currently being hosted from my computer. I have a friend at my house at the moment, and he is using a different computer. He installed the client but he cannot connect. I changed the client IP to 127.0.0.1 in the gui.java but even that didn&#39;t work. I was just wondering if there is something else I need to change. Help is extremely appreciated.</description>
