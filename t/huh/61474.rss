    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;(Here)[/url]&quot;]MYERS: Mr. Chairman, the armed forces did not shoot down any aircraft. When it became clear what the threat was, we did scramble fighter aircraft, AWACS, radar aircraft and tanker aircraft to begin to establish orbits in case other aircraft showed up in the FAA system that were hijacked. But we never actually had to use force.

LEVIN: Was that order that you just described given before or after the Pentagon was struck? Do you know?

MYERS: That order, to the best of my knowledge, was after the Pentagon was struck.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

              <p>PaulT, I like the way you think. We will never know the truth 100% about 9/11, and maybe that’s a good thing? Maybe the government were involved and attacked their own country for the motives of war and oil. It’s what governments do. Hide things from their members. There is nothing you, me, anyone else can do.</p>
<p>The point I’m getting at is posting your information on here, wont create a massive worldwide debate, it will only create flame wars, and ultimately, deter people from believing this.<br>
No matter what you post on here, people will believe what they choose to believe, even if the amount of research you have provided is overwhelmingly believable.</p>
<p>I, for one, live in the UK and therefore, this whole conspiracy doesn’t interest me. I’m a firm believe that terrorists murdered the 1,000s of people. Not the American Government.</p>

<p>It isn’t that the protocol doesn’t work. It <a href="http://911research.wtc7.net/planes/defense/index.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">wasn’t followed.</a><br>
If it was simple incompetence that allowed 9/11 to happen, how come hundreds of people, not only in the military, but in the FAA and NORAD were not fired?<br>
What about the obvious discrepencies, such as the one in the original post of this topic?<br>
Why would so many block an investigation, wouldn’t those in the highest levels of government want to prevent another attack by getting rid of the hundreds of idiots who allowed the attack to happen?</p>
<p>The truth is that the FAA and NORAD are not staffed by retards. They could see the planes every step of the way. Everywhere they went. There was no reason for Flight 77 to hit the Pentagon.</p>

</aside>
<p>Maybe some of it’s true. I don’t know. All I know is that the government disagrees with itself (and common sense) on the issue of 9/11.</p>
<p>I have vividly showed this point in the first post of this topic, where testimony (testimony by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, no less) before the US congress days after 9/11  disagrees with testimony by the Secretary of Transportation. The 9/11 Commission Report was clearly a revisionist account.</p>
<p>The 9/11 Commission report can’t explain the simple fact that there was plenty of warning about Flight 77, and plenty of time to shoot it down (See the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/911.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Congressional Inquiry</a> into 9/11). The report doesn’t even mention if the Pentagon might have some sort of air defense system, or radar. Despite the fact that Cheney was getting up to the minute reports of the planes location as it flew toward the pentagon.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>In the original post of this topic I have provided an excerpt from General Myers confirmation hearing, two days after 9/11, where he clearly states that no planes were scrambled untill after the pentagon was hit.</p>
<p>In the original post of this topic I have provided a video showing testimoney before the 9/11 Commission that Dick Cheney was aware of the plane flying toward the Pentagon, and that he was getting accurate updates on the position of the plane as it approached.</p>
<p>According to a September 14 Washington post article, General Myers was deeply involved in the military response to 9/11. Really? <span class="bbcode-b">Was</span> there a military response? Woudn’t the government have scrambled planes immediately after the twin towers were struck?</p>
<blockquote>"The last routine radio contact with the plane was at 8:50 a.m. A few minutes later the plane made an unauthorized turn. At 9:39 a.m., flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon's soutwest side."</blockquote>
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/911.html
<blockquote>Flight 77, which took off from Dulles International Airport outside Washington shortly after 8 a.m., stayed aloft until 9:45 a.m. and would have been visible on the F.A.A.'s radar system as it reversed course in the Midwest an hour later to fly back to Washington. The radars would have observed it even though its tracking beacon had been turned off.</blockquote>
http://s3.amazonaws.com/911timeline/2001/nyt091501c.html
<p>The idea that the plane was somehow “Lost” from radar screens for long periods of time (an idea presented in the 9/11 Commission Report) is therefore preposturous. The military had ample opportunity to shoot down Flight 77.</p>
<p>Flimsy facts? The government has done nothing but provide these. Consider <a href="http://www.standdown.net/noradseptember182001pressrelease.htm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">NORADs</a> report on Flight 77 (provided on Sept. 18). According to this report, the military was made aware of Flight 77’s hijacking at 9:24, about half an hour after the first signs of it being hijacked. And, it should also be noted, over half an hour after Flight 11 hit the WTC, at 8:46.</p>
<p>Anybody with a shred of common sense can see that the government allowed the attacks to happen.</p>

<p>Ok, I was using hyperbole. Not all of my rights are gone.  But many are. Let’s look at the bill of rights.</p>
<blockquote>Amendment I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Amendment IV
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>

<p>Who gives a fuck if it was a purple dildo with dots that hit the pentagon, whatever it was the government didn’t shoot it down, though they could have. Now my country is involved in a bloody war for oil, and my government has taken away all of my basic rights, thanks to 9/11 and whatever hit the pentagon. Yeah, it was probably a plane. But it’s not my fault the government won’t release any video of the actual plane flying into the pentagon. And they do have a video, the FBI confiscated it, minutes after the attack, from a gas station which has a camera aimed at the spot where the plane hit.</p>
