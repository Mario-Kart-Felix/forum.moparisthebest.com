Now before your a noob and say &quot;well i can see from the ,class8.java:202: cannot find symbol, that you are missing something. I know this. I am trying to grab the equipment interface from IClarity and put it into my client, since myn auto updates things like this. I just need to finish it and put it into my update server. I just need help finding the code in his class30_Sub2-Sub1_Sub1. I have done all the rest, just this part i dont get.
I attached it to this, his class9 and class30_sub2_sub1_sub1, if you can help, PLEASE DO SO.

Also, dont make those dumb comments that i mentioned above.</description>
