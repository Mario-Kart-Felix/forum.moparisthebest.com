<p>Athiesm is not a religion. Most athiests are religious in some way (agnostic, taostic, et.c.)</p>
<p>Mormons just want the most wives not the biggest religion.</p>

<p>Oh, it’s not hard to understand. It gives people a feeling of security, and it makes them feel like they are having a <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/depeche+mode/personal+jesus_20039367.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">personal relationship with god</a>, if they are a Christian.[/quote]</p>
<p>Don’t forget that everyone is afraid of dying and afraid of what will happen. When the truth is really that when we die, we don’t go anywhere, we just rot in the dirt. We have no souls. We’re just more intelligent animals. And since animals don’t go anywhere when they die (according to the bible :rolleyes:) then we certainly do not.</p>
<p>lol I didn’t even know atheists cared about religion. Atheists all have different views, so you really can’t say ALL atheists care about religion, and if they did, wouldn’t they be theists? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I’ve really never seen an Athiest (around here) discriminate any religion…[/quote]</p>
<p>you are aware you spell it atheist not “athiest” if your gonna say u are atheist then say it right<br>
i am atheist and i don’t go off on people about being christian or w/e i don’t care i was once christan or however u spell it i just stopped believeing that he was possible…but i have nothing against christans unless they say shit like that i worship the devil or that i’m going to hell  because to me i don’t believe in that shit so do you think i care that i’m going to your vision of devil that i don’t believe exist??</p>

              <p>It’s alot easier to believe that a higher being created everything, than to believe that it somehow just ‘happened.’<br>
I actually used to think the same as most of you guys - parents forced me into church and I hated it.<br>
Now I have just experienced to much to deny that there is a God.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am racist because i very much detest muslims and sikhs with there terroist martyrs. And yes… most of the ones i have met have sed they had considered fighting for there religion.<br>
I am just  a tiny big negative to the other religions… cept bhuddism… but i would not have to determination to reach enlightenment (if that is possible) … bhuddhists are the only ones that works for a better world.</p>

              <p>thats a nice video, i dont live in america, the video shocked me a little about the things america does, not teaching evolution! thats outragous</p>
<p>i know that during the cold war, america used christianity as a way of being different from communist russia (commumist countries are athest)</p>
<p>some phrases like “in god we trust” were added around the 1950s because of that</p>
<p>i think the bible was written by people wanting more power or control, the basic message is “obey the king/queen/church because they are chosen by god, or you go to hell”</p>
<p>this is my message to other fellow athests<br>
“God didn’t create man, Man created God to rule over other men”</p>
<p>also, a lot of other athests think “wheres the proof”, well it seems that releous people dont care about proof, they care about nice ideas, ideas that seem ‘right’, e.g. be good and you’ll be rewarded with heaven</p>

              <p>I’m atheist and I don’t beleive in Religion or particuarly afterlife for many [scientific] reasons. For example where is the scientific proof behind this “afterlife”, when you die your body starts to decay and that which was once you is gone. You, or better yet, your conscience mind, dies when you do. Your brain is your conscience mind and when it stops working you are essentially gone. You have no thoughts or any feeling what so ever because <span class="bbcode-u">you are dead</span>. Now I don’t know if that makes sense to you guys or not but IMO I’d rather have peace of mind knowing that there is no afterlife rather than living my life with false hope.</p>
