Here’s one example in which you’d be wrong. You see your friend John walking down the street. He always talks about his girlfriend Jane, about how much he loves her. So you see him, you think of Jane and him, then to them in love. So really you thought John -&gt; Love.<br>
You don’t have to feel the feelings necessarily because if that person is feeling them and you see them that way, it could make you think “Hey, that’s awesome that he/she feels that way” and it can inspire you to think of something that makes you feel that way or just that it gave you an idea for a picture, which it did in this case.</p>

then you must be gay because you think about love peace and happiness when you see men.<br>

Call me gay all you want, you know it’s not true, I know it’s not true. Never did I say I felt that way about men.<br>
Think is the keyword, doesn’t mean you have loving feelings towards him. Am I gay because I see pass sheer ignorance and realize thinking of peace, thinking of love or thinking of happiness isn’t a matter of sexuality?<br>
Even if you did think of love when you thought of another man, doesn’t mean you loved him necessarily. What comes to mind when you think of John Lennon? When you think of the Dali Lama?<br>
Get your head out of your ass and see your post for what it really is, ignorance.</p>
