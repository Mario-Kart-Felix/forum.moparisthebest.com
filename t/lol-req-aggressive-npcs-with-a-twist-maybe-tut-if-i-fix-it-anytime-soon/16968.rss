    <title>Lol [REQ] aggressive npc&#39;s with a twist (maybe TuT if i fix it anytime soon)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lol-req-aggressive-npcs-with-a-twist-maybe-tut-if-i-fix-it-anytime-soon/16968</link>
    <description>Is there any possible way to have two npc&#39;s attack each other to create a fight scene somewhat like the gnome / khazard fight from rs. Also, the same npcs&#39;w WON&#39;T attack the other npc&#39;s around the world. well they shouldn&#39;t if they are aggressive only to each other. where there not close anywhere else in the world. -_-  :confused: i&#39;ve been trying to do this for a  few days :|

edit: i&#39;m blazed and am trying to make sense :(


edit: maybe not even actually attack each other maybe give them an attack animation, not be able to walk.</description>
