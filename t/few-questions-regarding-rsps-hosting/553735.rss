    <title>Few questions regarding RSPS/hosting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-questions-regarding-rsps-hosting/553735</link>
    <description>Hello all, 

I&#39;ve been playing RS since the end of classic and stopped when dungeoneering got released.
I am trying to relieve the nostalgia of RS2 via a RSPS that I would host myself and play offline (if that&#39;s possible).

Question #1 What would be the best RSPS to download, that would include everything RS2 had, just before dungeoneering? I don&#39;t want any kinds of hack, cheat or xp boost whatsoever.

Question #2 Would it be possible to host and play said RSPS on my machine while being completely offline?

I would gladly send 20$ via Paypal to someone who could help me set up this whole process, as I am not tech savy  :D

Thanks in advance, 

Caélestis.</description>

Your best bet is to find a server/client of the revision you’re looking for (I think 562 is close to what you want) and then program it yourself. It’ll take some time and effort, plus you’ll need to know how to write code.</p>
<p>Question 2: Yes. Totally possible.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply. So basically I am screwed, since I don’t have the tech knowledge to do such things.</p>
