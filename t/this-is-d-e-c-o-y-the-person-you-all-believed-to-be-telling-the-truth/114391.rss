[00:37] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] Quote from: D E C O Y on June 20, 2007, 04:19:39 PM
[00:37] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] You want to know what happend
[00:37] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] Quote
[00:37] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] Just let silab release her source, Yours seems to difficult... After looking at it, i gave up.. Sorry if you get flamed, i just don&#39;t want my members leaving...
[00:37] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] But anyways.. i won&#39;t let you get banned.
[00:37] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] - Moparisthebest
[00:37] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] you basically impersonated me, I never sent that pm
[00:37] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] You sent it. check
[00:37] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] rofl.
[00:37] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] you really do live the lie don&#39;t  you
[00:37] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] not only ...would I... never talk... like this...
[00:38] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] have any of you ever seen me end anything I type with a 
[00:38] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] -moparisthebest
[00:38] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] ?
[00:38] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Not Truthfully
[00:38] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] i have the most posts on the forums, probably over 5000
[00:38] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] does that valentines day card count
[00:38] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] never have I said -moparisthebest
[00:38] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] mopar doesnt
[00:38] [b]&lt;_^_&gt;[/b] You said it once when you were drunk iirc
[00:38] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] you have done ~Moparisthebest at one point
[00:39] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] correction, I have 4929 posts
[00:39] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Just round it to 5000
[00:39] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] damn i was expecting better excuses from decoy, this is lame :(
[00:39] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] more probably &lt;/3 trash bin
[00:39] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] never have I talked with ... or ended with -moparisthebest
[00:39] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] decoy
[00:39] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] how is upload going?
[00:39] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Like i said, i&#39;d have to do it at work, or you can get it out of frugoo.
[00:39] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] also decoy, I have ran the forums since january of 06
[00:40] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] ill go see if I can track down Frugoo Scape
[00:40] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] and all of the sudden now I would start lying and covering things up?
[00:40] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] :P
[00:40] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Im Aware of that
[00:40] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] mod  taharok dont bother
[00:40] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] decoy, it wouldnt even be as bad if you were a good liar
[00:40] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] frugoo wouldnt know how to run it if he had it
[00:40] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] but you are the worst liar Ive ever seen
[00:40] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] lol
[00:41] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] how would frugoo not be able to search for void main through all files silab?
[00:41] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] you know mopar theirs a image version of your quote going around  too
[00:41] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] a main void decoy i though it was c++?
[00:41] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] really? cool, link me
[00:41] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] i never said it was c++
[00:41] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] check the posts
[00:41] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] rofl....
[00:41] [b]&lt;_^_&gt;[/b] C++ uses main() also
[00:41] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] I said, i believed the servers were in c++
[00:41] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] the fact that you call methods voids is cute enough
[00:41] [b]&lt;_^_&gt;[/b] but it returns an int
[00:41] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] decoy, bottom line is you dont have a server, you probably couldnt write a hello world
[00:41] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] frugoo is coming i think
[00:41] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Lol
[00:42] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] moparisthebest let me see the rubbish bin
[00:42] [b]&lt;_^_&gt;[/b] stop lolling so much
[00:42] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] prove me wrong decoy, Im waiting
[00:42] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Just wait
[00:42] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] so where is it?
[00:42] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] you said just wait last night
[00:42] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] I&#39;m waiting
[00:42] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] oo
[00:42] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] in fact thats the last pm I got
[00:42] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] sexy time
[00:42] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] If you couldn&#39;t read i said it was on a work cpu
[00:42] [b]&lt;_^_&gt;[/b] &quot;work cpu&quot;
[00:43] [b]&lt;_^_&gt;[/b] what the hell?
[00:43] * Tree laughs
[00:43] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] OMFG
[00:43] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] yea, because we all keep our huge projects in only one place right?
[00:43] * mod_taharok coughs
[00:43] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Lol?
[00:43] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] im sure the apache devs only keep the source on a work computer as well
[00:43] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] and we do these projects on the job as well
[00:43] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Lol, its kind of hard not to
[00:43] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] decoy, what do you do for work anyway?
[00:43] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] im curious
[00:44] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] fbi
[00:44] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] how is it hard not to decoy 
[00:44] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Lol, just ask frugoo about it. I&#39;m sure he has a reasonable answer.
[00:44] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] i got my money on wendys
[00:44] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] you said it was 246kb
[00:44] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] you could upload it
[00:44] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] email it
[00:44] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] decoy
[00:44] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] frugoo is afk
[00:44] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] put it on a flippin floppy disk
[00:44] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Again, you people couldn&#39;t read
[00:44] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] or he doesnt care about ur ban
[00:44] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] so why is it so hard to have at home as well? :P
[00:45] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Because, its difficult when your cpu is linux
[00:45] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] I cba to do anything with it
[00:45] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] WINE
[00:45] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] wtf my pc has no floppy drive
[00:45] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] I have wine
[00:45] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] my cpu has always been linux
[00:45] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] how does that make anything difficult?
[00:45] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] it makes everything easier for me
[00:45] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] im not very used to ubuntu
[00:45] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] http://google.com
[00:45] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] decoy, don&#39;t most people work the same hours every day?
[00:45] * Lothy has left #decoy
[00:46] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] do you work the same hours every day?
[00:46] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] I do work the same hours everyday
[00:46] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] I go to work at 2:00 AM Eastern time
[00:46] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Nyc
[00:46] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] oh, but you said last night at this same time you uploaded the source and pmed it to me...
[00:46] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] so how did that work?
[00:46] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] lol
[00:46] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] I didn&#39;t talk to you until 2:00+
[00:46] -&gt;[/b] -moparisthebest- let me see the rubbish bin please ill grab the image of your reply to d e c oy
[00:46] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] according to you, you would have been home at that time

[00:57] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] it should be in your server.

[00:57] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] you should remember what you  wrote

[01:01] [b]&lt;_^_&gt;[/b] wtf
[01:01] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Idk who started that rumor
[01:01] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] oh so people where just saying you said it?
[01:01] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] decoy, just so you know, if I am not here you can send the server to anyone in this channel
[01:02] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] Lol, read my recent posts
[01:02] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] they can get it to me
[01:02] [b]&lt;_^_&gt;[/b] The 460 client is going to be made in asm, not C++ &gt;[/b]_&gt;[/b]
[01:02] [b]&lt;MissSilabSoft&gt;[/b] why would they bother making up such a lie?
[01:02] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] decoy, or anyone in #mopar or #moparscape
[01:02] [b]&lt;mod_taharok&gt;[/b] frugoo is coming
[01:02] [b]&lt;decoy&gt;[/b] lol, i&#39;m not sending to those
[01:02] [b]&lt;Tree&gt;[/b] dont send to me
[01:02] [b]&lt;moparisthebest&gt;[/b] but you said I told you not to release it right decoy ?

How does that mean its outdated.
<p>The client is fine, its just that there isnta server built for it yet.</p>
<p>People making a 459 client really is not hard. Most people could do it. Its just the packets are completely different so to get it working with a server you would have to write a whole new connection and packet handler etc.</p>

Bullshit. his client does work. and will only work if you have a 459 server.[/quote]</p>
<p>No his client is out dated, it does not work. He says you need a 459 server.</p>
