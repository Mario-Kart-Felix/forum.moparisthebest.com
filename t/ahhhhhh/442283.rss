<p>And Kieth, it doesn’t even matter if the report of the CC being stolen was actually by RSCR, you were banned before the topic was created so it’s irrelevant either way :rolleyes:</p>

<p>No mods did anything a long time ago because I never done anything wrong obviously else they would have. He didn’t do “What mods should have done a long time ago”. I already stated why it was banned from here, which was nearly almost a year ago now. You just dislike me for no particular reason, and probably follow every single post I have and reply to them. If you’re going to accuse me of ‘Keylogging’ my players, please post some evidence and some malicious code there is. If not, shut up about it because you just do it to make yourself feel better. You always say I’m a bad administrator and what not when I have never abused or done anything to my players, not even once. But once again, I was banned for posting an IP address almost over a year ago.<br>

Just like Snoopy? Rofl, post evidence of me ever infecting my players idiot. That’s right, you can’t. You mad yet? You say I’m  a bad Administrator and you can’t even maintain your server. Such as your last one you put up, and it wasn’t even up that long if that. If there was anything wrong with my server and if I abused or did anything, I wouldn’t have all these players now would I? I also never try to hide who I am, at all. I can careless if people know its me.</p>

<p>Huh? I don’t need to defend myself. Seeing as I’m using Moparclassic downloader for the client it should be fine. If you read above, I didn’t mean it like that. I meant it as in the past Administrators have attempted to abuse or do something, but never had since I check before I release the client. My client has never been infected, so if you’re going to say it is post some proof of it lol. If there was anything wrong with my server, I wouldn’t have 70+ Online peaking 100.</p>
<p>Also I haven’t updated the client for a while now, if you check the dates on the file. My client doesn’t check a MD5 Checksum right now either.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not the one making topics here about RscR I could careless to advertise on here now. I have a lot of other places to. But nothings wrong with my client, you could have checked that yourself.</p>
<p>The only reason my server was banned was because I released an IP of someone hacking tons of accounts. Not because it was virus related.<br>

<p>I obviously didn’t mean it like that, whenever usually happened to my server. IE: Abusive Admins and what not, or anything in general it was usually a different developer/Mod/Admin that caused it. Picking little bits our my sentence and putting words in my mouth won’t get you anywhere. I can careless, if you want to say there is something in my client go for it. You can look through the source code with what I provided easily. Oh also, my client has never been infected. I obviously posted proof. I can careless what any of you say, it’s just you guys like saying a lot of false things and some ignorant people believe you. Now good day, I won’t be posting here now.[/quote]</p>
<p>We’re not talking about “abusive admins”. The topic is about you and your viruses. So when you say “it was the other developers that screwed me over <span class="bbcode-b">and ended up doing something</span>”, it’s implied.</p>

<p>You make yourself look stupid when you say my client has a keylogger in it, when you could easily check it if anything is encrypted or if there is any malicious code in it since it’s not even obfuscated.

<p>I obviously didn’t mean it like that, whenever usually happened to my server. IE: Abusive Admins and what not, or anything in general it was usually a different developer/Mod/Admin that caused it.
