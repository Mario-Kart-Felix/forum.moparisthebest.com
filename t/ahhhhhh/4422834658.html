Hey guys I created a new account and told you guys to download a new upload of the client with a different md5 checksum than the one originally accused of being infected oh and by the way it was USUALLY the other administrator that inserted malicious code.</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>Huh? I don’t need to defend myself. Seeing as I’m using Moparclassic downloader for the client it should be fine. If you read above, I didn’t mean it like that. I meant it as in the past Administrators have attempted to abuse or do something, but never had since I check before I release the client. My client has never been infected, so if you’re going to say it is post some proof of it lol. If there was anything wrong with my server, I wouldn’t have 70+ Online peaking 100.</p>
<p>Also I haven’t updated the client for a while now, if you check the dates on the file. My client doesn’t check a MD5 Checksum right now either.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not the one making topics here about RscR I could careless to advertise on here now. I have a lot of other places to. But nothings wrong with my client, you could have checked that yourself.</p>
<p>The only reason my server was banned was because I released an IP of someone hacking tons of accounts. Not because it was virus related.[/quote]<br>
That’s hilarious. Do you expect anybody to believe that bullshit you make up?</p>

No mods did anything a long time ago because I never done anything wrong obviously else they would have. He didn’t do “What mods should have done a long time ago”. I already stated why it was banned from here, which was nearly almost a year ago now. You just dislike me for no particular reason, and probably follow every single post I have and reply to them. If you’re going to accuse me of ‘Keylogging’ my players, please post some evidence and some malicious code there is. If not, shut up about it because you just do it to make yourself feel better. You always say I’m a bad administrator and what not when I have never abused or done anything to my players, not even once. But once again, I was banned for posting an IP address almost over a year ago.</p>

<p>Hey guys I created a new account and told you guys to download a new upload of the client with a different md5 checksum than the one originally accused of being infected oh and by the way it was USUALLY the other administrator that inserted malicious code.</p>
<p>Are you even trying to defend yourself?</p>

<p>Huh? I don’t need to defend myself. Seeing as I’m using Moparclassic downloader for the client it should be fine. If you read above, I didn’t mean it like that. I meant it as in the past Administrators have attempted to abuse or do something, but never had since I check before I release the client. My client has never been infected, so if you’re going to say it is post some proof of it lol. If there was anything wrong with my server, I wouldn’t have 70+ Online peaking 100.</p>
<p>Also I haven’t updated the client for a while now, if you check the dates on the file. My client doesn’t check a MD5 Checksum right now either.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not the one making topics here about RscR I could careless to advertise on here now. I have a lot of other places to. But nothings wrong with my client, you could have checked that yourself.</p>
<p>The only reason my server was banned was because I released an IP of someone hacking tons of accounts. Not because it was virus related.</p>

No mods did anything a long time ago because I never done anything wrong obviously else they would have. He didn’t do “What mods should have done a long time ago”. I already stated why it was banned from here, which was nearly almost a year ago now. You just dislike me for no particular reason, and probably follow every single post I have and reply to them. If you’re going to accuse me of ‘Keylogging’ my players, please post some evidence and some malicious code there is. If not, shut up about it because you just do it to make yourself feel better. You always say I’m a bad administrator and what not when I have never abused or done anything to my players, not even once. But once again, I was banned for posting an IP address almost over a year ago.[/quote]<br>
You’re just like snoopy. Now, someone ban hammer this kid before he infects us all.</p>

Just like Snoopy? Rofl, post evidence of me ever infecting my players idiot. That’s right, you can’t. You mad yet? You say I’m  a bad Administrator and you can’t even maintain your server. Such as your last one you put up, and it wasn’t even up that long if that. If there was anything wrong with my server and if I abused or did anything, I wouldn’t have all these players now would I? I also never try to hide who I am, at all. I can careless if people know its me.</p>
