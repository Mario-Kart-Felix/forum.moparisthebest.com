    <title>Questions on creating a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/questions-on-creating-a-server/386399</link>
    <description>Hi, I pretty much want to start on a server for the first time. I&#39;ve played rsps&#39;s for about 3 years and want to get started on my own as i know what attracts people. My question is....How do i start pretty much? Do i need something like a base server i can just start adding codes to? I have no idea where to find a server to start, pretty much i want a 317 with curse prayers;etc. I just need help on what im going to need to do.

I might have said base but idk what it is you need. i think its a source and client? idk but i just want to start coding my 317 lol</description>

              <p>My first 317 was a silab, but I advise you DO NOT START WITH SILAB. Start with a delta or PI. I always hated PI because of their crappy clients, but that’s just me. I recommend a delta. Deltas have very customizable clients. Also in my opinion, it is a lot easier to add models in delta clients. But yeah, go to the server downloads section. Good luck! When you are done, maybe you can PM me the details to your server! I would love to play.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>check the downloads section and look for a decent source and client, i reccomend a PI because of the layout, is easy to understand and edit <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
