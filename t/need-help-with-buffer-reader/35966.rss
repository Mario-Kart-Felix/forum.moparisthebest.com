    <title>Need help with Buffer Reader!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-buffer-reader/35966</link>
    <description>!I need help making a buffer reader thats reads the whole folder, not just 1 file. Just like the characters file.
I though of something like this

BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;./data/clans/&quot;+clanname+&quot;.txt&quot;));

but that seems to only look for the file name 0.txt in the clans folder...

Thx :)

Also how can i make it so the buffer reader reads 2 lines of text?
Like 

Clan- something
owner: yakooza

and make it set yakooza the owner of the clan?</description>
