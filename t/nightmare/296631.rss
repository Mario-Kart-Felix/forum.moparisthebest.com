    <description>Definetly falling. Last one was that i was at a amusement park. I was sitting to one of those machines that go high and fast, when suddenly the thing goes up without i got my safety gear on. i hold on like hell from somekind of a bar until my grip looses and i fall from like 100m down.
when i touched the land, the touch was like &#39;tap&#39; and it didnt feel a thing.  :rolleyes:&#39; the fall felt AWFUL</description>

              <p>My nightmares were strange when I had them. I really only had them when I was around 7-9 years old, and they tended to contain ReDeads from Zelda :3. They never chased me or anything, they were kinda just there and I woke up scared .-. And half of the dreams that I have now are the kind most people would find as nightmares. I mean really, most people find getting attacked by a great white and it barely missing you nightmarish…I find it cool :P. Same goes for falling, although I’m terribly scared of heights, falling in a dream is fun, especially when taking a nap and you kick someone nearby with that spaz you get xD</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Fall</p>
<p>To dream that you fall and are not frightened, signifies that you will overcome your adversities with ease.     meanings by <a href="http://DreamMoods.com" rel="nofollow noopener">DreamMoods.com</a></p>
<p>To dream that you fall and are frightened, indicates a lack of control, insecurity, and/or lack of support in your waking life. You may be experiencing some major struggle and/or overwhelming problem. It may denote that you have failed to achieve a goal that you have set forth for yourself.</p>
<p>To dream that you are free-falling through water, indicates that you are feeling overwhelmed with emotions. You may feel that it is easier to give up, then to try to stay afloat or prevent yourself from going under.</p>
<p>Being Chased</p>
<p>Chase dreams is one of several common dream themes. As with most of the common dreams, they often stem from feelings of anxiety in your waking life. Running is an instinctive response to physical threats in your environment. In these dreams, you can be pursued by an attacker, an animal or an unknown figure, who wants to hurt or possibly kill you. In turn, you run, hide or try to outwit your pursuer. Your actions in the dream parallel how you respond to pressure and cope with fears, stress or various situations in your waking life. Instead of confronting the situation, you are running away and avoiding it. Ask yourself who is the one chasing you so that you can gain understanding and insight on the source of your fears and anxieties.</p>
<p>The pursuer or attacker who is chasing you in your dream may also represent an aspect of yourself. Your own feelings of anger, jealousy, fear, and possibly love, can assume the appearance of threatening figure. The shadowy figure can also symbolize rejected characteristics of your self. You may be projecting these feelings onto the unknown chaser. Next time you have a chase dream, turn around and confront your pursuer. Ask them why they are chasing you. Perhaps you are running away from something. What are you trying to run from?</p>
<p>If you are the one doing the chasing, then the dream may highlight your drive and ambition to go after something you want. Or perhaps the dream suggests that you are falling behind and having to catch up with everyone else.</p>
<p>Consider the distance or gap between you and your pursuer. This indicates your closeness to the issue. If the pursuer is gaining on you, then it suggests that the problem is not going to go away. The problem will surround you until you confront and address it. However, if you are able to widen the gap between your pursuer, then the problem is becoming less and less of an issue. You are able to successful distance yourself from the problem. In essence, the problem is fading away.</p>
<p>A more direct analysis of chase dreams is the fear of being attacked. Such dreams are more common among women than men, who may feel physically vulnerable in the urban environment. These dreams are inspired by fears of violence and sexual assault in which we are so over-exposed from the media, which magnifies such fears.</p>
<p>Death</p>
<p>To dream about the death of a loved one, suggests that you are lacking a certain aspect or quality that the loved one embodies. Ask yourself what makes this person special or what do you like about him. It is that very quality that you are lacking in your own relationship or circumstances. Alternatively, it indicates that whatever that person represents has no part in your own life.</p>
<p>To dream of your own death, indicates a transitional phase in your life. You are becoming more enlightened or spiritual. Alternatively, you are trying desperately to escape the demands of your daily life.</p>
<p>Die</p>
<p>To dream that you die in your dream, symbolizes inner changes, transformation, self-discovery and positive development that is happening within you or in your life. Although such a dreams may bring about feelings of fear and anxiety, it is no cause for alarm and is often considered a positive symbol.  Dreams of experiencing your own death usually means that big changes are ahead for you. You are moving on to new beginnings and leaving the past behind. These changes does not necessarily imply a negative turn of events. Metaphorically, dying can be seen as an end or a termination to your old ways and habits. So, dying does not always mean a physical death, but an ending of something.</p>
<p>On a negative note, to dream that you die may represent involvement in deeply painful relationships or unhealthy, destructive behaviors. You may feeling depressed or feel strangled by a situation or person in your waking life. Perhaps your mind is preoccupied with someone who is terminally ill or dying. Alternatively, you may be trying to get out of some obligation, responsibility or other situation.</p>
<p>To see someone dying in your dream, signifies that your feelings for that person are dead or that a significant change/loss is occurring in your relationship with that person. Alternatively, you may want to repress that aspect of yourself that is represented by the dying person.</p>
<p>Pain</p>
<p>To dream that you are in pain, signifies that you are being too hard on yourself, especially if a situation was out of your control. It may also be a true reflection of real pain that exists somewhere in your body. Dreams can reveal and warn about health problems. Consider where the pain is for additional significance. If the pain is in your neck, then the dream may be a metaphor that you are literally being a “pain in the neck”.</p>
<p>To dream that you are inflicting pain to yourself,  indicates that you are experiencing some overwhelming turmoil or problems in your waking life. You are trying to disconnect yourself from your reality by concentrating on the pain that you inflicted to yourself.</p>
<p>Trees</p>
<p>To see lush green trees in your dream, symbolize new hopes, growth, desires, knowledge, and life. It also implies strength, protection and stability. You are concentrating on your own self-development and individuation.</p>
<p>To dream that you are climbing a tree, signifies that you will achieve your career goals and reach those high places in society.  The degree of difficulty to which you climb the tree will measure the speed of your achievement of these goals.</p>
<p>To dream that you cut down a tree, signifies that you are wasting your energy, time, and money on foolish pursuits. Alternatively, it may be a comment on your sexual fears or guilt.</p>
<p>To see a falling tree in your dream, indicates that you are off balance and out of sync. You are off track and headed in the wrong direction.</p>
