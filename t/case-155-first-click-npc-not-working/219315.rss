    <title>Case 155: first click npc not working?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/case-155-first-click-npc-not-working/219315</link>
    <description>I have no clue why but my case 155 just randomly stopped working.  Any of the npcs that u could click talk-to and it opened a shop wont work anymore.  Any of the npcs that would have a dialogue with you will not work anymore.  I am 100% sure its not the shops or now the dialogue that is the error because they both work with other things, its case 155.  Please help me, i&#39;ve asked many times on this help section and not one person has answered me yet.  :(</description>
