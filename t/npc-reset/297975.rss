    <description>Is there are sort of NPC Reset feature?

like for instance if a boss kills a player, it will respawn with full health

Because at the moment players are able to 1 item bosses by simply going straight back to the boss after they die and it will have same hp.. and after a few runs they eventually kill it.. not exactly &quot;fair play&quot;

All I need is a direction to a file, or where abouts in a file and I can get on and figure out the rest.. I have done some checks around NPChandler but havent found anything of Use.

**Note** If it helps, at the moment Jad resets after killing player. So Id like to find out what it is in the code, causing him to &quot;reset&quot;.

Thanks in advance
