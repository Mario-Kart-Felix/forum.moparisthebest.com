    <description>I don&#39;t know where to post this, but this section will do.

Q. Are there currently any decent point system servers that look like they&#39;ll actually last for a while? I used to play the original google.com (oh, the name of the server is censored, but I think that most people would know what I&#39;m talking about), and since that ended I&#39;ve always been on the lookout for other servers like it, but all I&#39;ve found during the years after are a few crappy servers that always have a major flaw (corrupt mods, stupid custom items etc etc).

If anybody knows of a server that uses a point system and actually has a half decent player base, please let me know about it.

Sorry if this is posted in the wrong section.</description>

<p>Posting material like that is sick, enjoy your mute.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>, check out the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,119.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">advertisement section</a>, you should find a decent server in there. I’ll have to lock this thread as it isn’t related to this section.</p>
