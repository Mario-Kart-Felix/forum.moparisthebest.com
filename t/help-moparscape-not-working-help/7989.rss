    <title>[HELP] MoparScape not working? [HELP]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-moparscape-not-working-help/7989</link>
    <description>I have been using moparscape on my other computer, my mom took it away. So now i use my old laptop and downloaded moparscape. When i tried to run the bat it had the downloading cache thing. it kept stopping at 10% then went to requesting title screen then it failed there &quot;retry in 10 seconds&quot; .... &quot;retry in 50 secs&quot;

so then i said f that... the cache is going to take 2 long to dl so i went to windows folder to the rs cache (.file_store_32) and copied all the files to the .mpr_file_store_32

then now i tried to run the moparscape bat when it was going to load up

IT GOES

&quot;STARTING UP&quot;

sorry an error has occured whils loading runescape
then a whole bunch of bs wannabe help tips

is it okay to just use the runescape cache in .file_store_32 for the .mpr_file_store_32 or does moparscape have different cache?
