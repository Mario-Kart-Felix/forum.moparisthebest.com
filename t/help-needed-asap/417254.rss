    <title>Help Needed ASAP!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-needed-asap/417254</link>
    <description>EDIT: I have No-ip and i got it port fowarded and what not, but i need to know how to set that up so that when i link friends to a DL client that they can enter to join me.


Hey guys, i dont want to sound like a hypocrite or anything but i need help and alot of it. I have been forever trying to get a moparscape server running but its just not happening, i want to run a 525 or higher so that its got all the new armour and stuff but im not sure what exact version that is (E.G. D claws, Third Age, Statius, Curses ) I really need help on making a latest server i guess you could say, if anyone has a server already made and could send me a link and instruct me on how to change the name of the server and change the messages annouced at random in the server and what not. Im really shitty with learning things like java coding so i will need basically a full guide that even Vegetables could understand, I really want to get my own server started and everything asap. 
Heres a little more info on what kind of source im looking for:
Magic Book Teleports
Donater Island
Donater,Super Donater Ranks
Skilling Area
No Spawning Commands For Players Besides Admins
Shops Already Pre-set with reasonable prices but no rares inside them.
Maybe if there is, a server with player shops so they can sell there stuff without advertising it.


Thanks For All Those That Help !!!
P.S. Dont link me to the guide on here because iève looked at it and i dont think it applies very well to a newer version of servers, it would REALLY help to have voice chat help too. i can be added on Mumble or Skype, email bivike@hotmail.com if you need to contact me VIA Voice.</description>

              <p>PI is such shit though, use hyperion! Nah JK, pick up a book on java, learn, then start with hyperion, using methods from other things so you can see how it works. Much better IMO, will make you better, and more respectable. Just a suggestion.</p>
