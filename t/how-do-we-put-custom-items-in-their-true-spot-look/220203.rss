Item.java would be for coding in the Id’s so you can see them perfectly without glitches.<br>
Item4 is what your looking for. Open that and place the id’s in the right section. Capes goes in Cape() obviously.</p>
<p>Good luck[/quote]</p>
<p>No… Item.cfg is the codes and bonuses(codes are actually client sided but code recognition for shops and so on is in item .cfg). Item.java contains all the “public static int capes[]” and so on. Lets say you wanted to add strength cape into the right equipment slot, you would find the public static int capes and add the strength cape id into the array</p>
