    <title>Error when trying to start server with run.bat?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-when-trying-to-start-server-with-run-bat/435211</link>
    <description>When I try and start my server up it comes up with a unusual error that I have never ever seen or had before.
The error somewhat looks like this:
[code]Error occurred during initialization of VM
Could not reserve enough space for object heap
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]
Any ideas on whats wrong and how can I possibly fix it?

[size=36pt]EDIT:[/size]
This error has been fixed by editing the amount of memory run.bat is allowed to take up. I changed it from 128 to 256 and it works fine.</description>
