The rest of you fagots just beg for help.. Before you even try to code it your self, so technically your all braking the rules.
&lt;blockquote&gt;3. We are not a Spoonfeeding community. We do not teach in an oversimplified manner to discourage independent thought. We encourage independent thought, meaning you must help yourselves before requesting help. Failure to provide some sort of prior knowledge or work to the problem will result in a lock of the topic. This is final.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So moderators please ban everyone then ban yourself, were all going to RuneLocus.com, The #1 RSPS community, so moparscape, Please go fuck yourself.</description>

<p>Do you have any idea how many help topics you’ve created on however many accounts you have? You’re no different than the ‘fagots that just beg for help’.</p>
