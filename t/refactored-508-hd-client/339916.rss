    <title>Refactored 508 HD client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/refactored-508-hd-client/339916</link>
    <description>I just thought I&#39;ll release this since it was sitting on my hard drive unused for a long time, and I don&#39;t have time for RSPS anymore.
Basically I&#39;ve been trying to find how to load all kinds of custom stuff on 508 HD client, and was refactoring it along the way.
What I remember that I have refactored there is...:
-Custom item models
-Custom object models
-Custom npc models
-Custom GFX models
-Custom GFX animations
-Custom Character body part models (head, chest, legs, arms etc.)
-Custom sprites
-Animations
-Interfaces
-Textures on item, object, npc models
-Textures on terrain (ground)

errr can&#39;t remember what else, but there&#39;s a lot more.
For animations, interfaces, textures - I am able to manipulate them from inside the cache, I don&#39;t know how to successfully load e.g. texture file from folder, so bare that in mind. If you know how then you will be able to do it with ease, because I found and refactored where it loads the shit, where it looks for that animation, texture or interface in cache so you just have to change it similarly like with custom models to make it load from folder.
This also has polygon limit removed, so you can load models with any amount of polygons and they will load fine (previously if model exceeded 2k or something polygons it would become invisible).

It is an Eclipse project, also bare in mind that it is very messy like lots of commented out stuff, might also be some shit printing out I can&#39;t remember, so just clean it yourselves. I really can&#39;t remember where I left off, because I haven&#39;t touched this for months.

Do not, I repeat, do not ask me for anything and do not ask me for help. I haven&#39;t touched this for many months and I don&#39;t do anything RSPS related anymore. If something doesn&#39;t work or if you don&#39;t get something, find it out yourselves or ask someone else for help.
I&#39;ll try to find some pictures and post here, but I cannot guarantee that I will get you some because I don&#39;t have eclipse installed right now and I am busy, maybe I have some pics on my hard disk or something so I&#39;ll look.

<p>If you’re having trouble getting past the surveys (which is rare case), simply open up any survey and leave it there, go do something else for like 1-2 mins. Then a small gray line should appear on top saying “Download not unlocking? Click here  to fix it and get the file.”. Click there and it will allow you to do a really short survey and u will get to download[/quote]<br>
I won’t bother with it then.</p>

-Textures on item, object, npc models<br>
-Textures on terrain (ground)</p>
<p>errr can’t remember what else, but there’s a lot more.<br>
For animations, interfaces, textures - I am able to manipulate them from inside the cache, I don’t know how to successfully load e.g. texture file from folder, so bare that in mind. If you know how then you will be able to do it with ease, because I found and refactored where it loads the shit, where it looks for that animation, texture or interface in cache so you just have to change it similarly like with custom models to make it load from folder.<br>
This also has polygon limit removed, so you can load models with any amount of polygons and they will load fine (previously if model exceeded 2k or something polygons it would become invisible).</p>
<p>It is an Eclipse project, also bare in mind that it is very messy like lots of commented out stuff, might also be some shit printing out I can’t remember, so just clean it yourselves. I really can’t remember where I left off, because I haven’t touched this for months.</p>

<p>Do not, I repeat, do not ask me for anything and do not ask me for help. I haven’t touched this for many months and I don’t do anything RSPS related anymore. If something doesn’t work or if you don’t get something, find it out yourselves or ask someone else for help.<br>
I’ll try to find some pictures and post here, but I cannot guarantee that I will get you some because I don’t have eclipse installed right now and I am busy, maybe I have some pics on my hard disk or something so I’ll look.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
