    <title>Port Forwarding and No-ip hosting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-and-no-ip-hosting/44369</link>
    <description>This is it, my server is 100% Done, I just need to host it!

*Problem*
Problem= I cant host it because my router isnt in the List at PortForward.com (or something like that)
Router= Speedport W501v
Host=No-ip.biz
Country=Germany, if that helps...
^^no negative comments on my English please!^^

*Solutions*
1st. A way I find out how to PortForward.
2nd. I get a second router (Somone told me, i dont get what this is supposed to do)
3rd. Someone tells me a different solution XD
4th. I use hamachi (No clue how it works), and its kinda stupid to be honest =/
5th. Someone I can trust host&#39;s this for me
6th. I heard I can host a server over a Website I do not know how to do this, and it would be best if it was free, somone plz respond to this.

*Notes*
-I DO know how to host it, i jsut dont know how to PortForward it because there is none for my on Portforward.com or something like that.

-I got an DSL Internet flatrate from -T---COM also known as Telekom

-Any other Information you need: JUST ASK!

-Rewards will only be given when the server is online!

-Router=Speedport W501v

*Rewards*
If you helped you will recieve in Turn

-Mod or Adminship on my server
-Runescape Gp if it has to be =(
