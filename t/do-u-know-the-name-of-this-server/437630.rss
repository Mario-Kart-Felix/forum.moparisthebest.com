    <title>Do u know the name of this server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/do-u-know-the-name-of-this-server/437630</link>
    <description>I remember a server (sorry if i have bad English im not english :D)
If u logged in u start with Red  d hide legs and red wizard top and hat.
And a red magic book and D scimmy.

And in the training place u had trolls and black dragons and some women and i think soldiers they always dropped rune.
And if u did ::shops u would go to the shops with white knights and they were dancing and there all were shops and stuff.
And u had ::skills with woodcutting runecrafing mining with purple ore.
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE THE NAME OF IT ? IT WAS A REALY GOOD SERVER !!!!!
