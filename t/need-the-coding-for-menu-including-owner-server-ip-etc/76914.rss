    <title>Need the coding for Menu including: Owner, Server Ip, etc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-the-coding-for-menu-including-owner-server-ip-etc/76914</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m looking for the code that shows a list, or rather menu in the top left corner [i][b]Or in the middle at the top[/b][/i] of your screen including details such as:

Owner
ServerIP
ServerName (i think)
Number of Players Online
&quot;Message&quot;

If anyone could give me a URL or paste the coding, I would really appreciate it. 

Thanks ,
