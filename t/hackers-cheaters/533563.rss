    <description>Hello there,

I got this problem on my server that people keep spawning cobwebs on my server, i think my packages are not secure etc..
but i dont know how i can make it secure or if there is an other client i can use for Rune-x-scape Source that is secure.

Also they are still able to login with cheat clients but i disabled that. so they have to login with my client or else it doesnt work.
but still people are able to use cheat clients,

Could someone help me out please would really appriciate it.
