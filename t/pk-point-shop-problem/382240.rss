    <title>PK Point Shop PROBLEM ! :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-point-shop-problem/382240</link>
    <description>I have a Pk Point shop on my source, and when i try to buy an item/s, it says &#39; you don&#39;t have enough coins &#39; when I actually have the right amount of pk points to buy the item/s. But it will sell to me when I have the coins.  So say an item is 100 PkPoints, I need 100 coins to buy it. But I need it to sell to me for PkPoints!

So how can I make it sell for Pk Points ?! !!  :o
When I Examine an item in the shop it perfectly says #### Pk Points which is fine because it says the cost of the item.</description>
