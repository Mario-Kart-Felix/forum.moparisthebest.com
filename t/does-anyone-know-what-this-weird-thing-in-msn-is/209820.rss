    <title>Does anyone know what this weird thing in msn is?</title>

    <description>I was in a group conversation, and a couple strange messages came up. The messages were like from a person, but it was in a different style to everybody else - smaller etc. There was nobody in the conversation with the name &#39;mod&#39; Everybody denied knowing what it was. I screenied them and threw them together in a picture.
