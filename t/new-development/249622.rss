    <description>[b]NEW UPDATE[/b]
Made Object owners
i.e. as the cannon was in RSC as people sayed shoots an entity within a view of 10...
only the owner of the cannon can pick up / fire the cannon
Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoFVdQ37NGo

Still waiting for suggestions on what to code....

[b]Old[/b]

Ok im tired of making new topics and what not...

flame if needed..

Im going to code new shit things people want...

and upon me feeling that it is stable enough i will release my server upon that feeling...


Supply what idea you think should be coded i will post a vid within 1-2 days

and i will post the code open source to the public unless asked otherwise.(if i feel the idea is worth coding)
^(This meaning dont ask for hay codes new npcs and dumb shit like that)

some vids...

[b]Quests:[/b]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KeFm8Acc9c

^basic quest system

[b]Agility[/b]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg5mNlJW11Y

^basic agility system can easily be coded for &quot;entire agility courses&quot;

[b]Cannon/Range Attacking[/b]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ira7dYkiZYY
^^Was bored thought would be fun... Cannon randomly finds a player and shoots them....^^
The ranging attack the mob looks for a player within a certain distance

<p>I think the dwarf cannon is a big +1</p>

<p>Yeh not a problem.</p>
<p>Ps: Have you read the dwarf cannon book? It has some basic info.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 08, 2008, 08:35:09 pm[/size][hr]As a development thing though I have always had a thing for an automated minigame capture the flag, involving no admin or mod help.</p>
<p>Your stats are temporarily changed to flat 1’s with 5 range and your inventory is wiped and automatically given food and bronze arrows. Everybody transfered to a giant map underground.</p>
<p>When player picks up flag he glows and all others only equiped with arrows and food must range him down and try to get the flag themselfs and retrieve it to the end zone. Automated prize depending on how many players is given. Everybody then teleported back to a certain spot.</p>
<p>But I don’t think the interest for novelty things like this are earning, but more base skills and solid development am I right? It would be very fun though.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I want(ed) to make a CTF system. Can’t get anyone to make the map I want though, meh.[/quote]<br>
I have an automated event system coming in play around Wednesday. you do ::event and a list of event pops up on the whole server for people to vote on. and the event with most votes the people whom voted are tellyed to it and the server host the event. kind like a “rock the vote” on other games… Just one of many advancements my secret coder is working on… ( no its not lefty lmao)</p>

              <p>What’s so special about this?  This takes under 5 minutes to do.  And next time, don’t use setlocation for the npc, only has a radius of 4 sq’s if you want to go over that they just appear on top of you.  Cannon is nothing special at all, invactionhandler to handle the base, invuseonobject to handle the rest…Might be a distance formula in there, but I doubt you’re even capable of that.</p>
