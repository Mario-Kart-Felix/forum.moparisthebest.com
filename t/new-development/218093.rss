              <p>[quote=“bloodpk3r, post:3, topic:218093”]okay well if your making a new server first off you need good staff members who arent corrupt and cant be bribed into making people into mods etc…</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>you need to have popular places in the server</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>pking area<br>
*shops<br>
*mini games etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>but the places you put them have to be unique places people havent put them b4!<br>
also some new ideas would be great if you know the coding to do it e.g making ur own mini games or making a battling arena or making new skills etc…</p>
<p>it needs to be realisticish dont make it so that straight away you get 99 att because people will find it to easy but then again dont make it as hard as the real runescape you need to find an exp rate that people enjoy but dont get annoyed with.</p>
<p>then you need unique stuff that maybe only a few servers have or that is completely new</p>
<ul>
<li>in game scoreboards</li>
<li>all skills working</li>
<li>the new skills<br>
etc…</li>
</ul>
<p>also your server needs very high uptime or 24/7 uptime because people hate offline servers so maybe a dedi?</p>
<p>you also will want a website/forum for the server as a lot of people will find this as an attraction.</p>
<p>hope this helped you with your request  :)[/quote]</p>
