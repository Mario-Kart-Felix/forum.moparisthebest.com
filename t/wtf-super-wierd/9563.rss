    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-super-wierd/9563</link>
    <description>Ok i am using Cheezscape 78 and its an awesome server and i have added loads to it and everything, but everytime you use range and even some ancient mage on a npc or a player the server crashes.. and i dont get it , it mostly crashes on range some of the ancients are ok. Does any body have a clue why it is doing this !?!? and a couple of my friends get it too . if anyone can help me with this i will be gratefull and can have a sneak peak at my duel arena server if you have hamachi. 

please post here and if you have further questions or need more information on this then add my msn messanger adress :  samma100@hotmail.com</description>
