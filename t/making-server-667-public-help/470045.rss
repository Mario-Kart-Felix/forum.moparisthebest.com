    <description>Hello guys I&#39;m having a small problem while trying to make my server which uses Zenithscape source public. It works perfectly fine with Hamachi,however, when I try to make it none Hamachi it never works this is what I did :

So I went to the Zenithscape client and I changed the IP in Loader and in client to my no-ip.duc it did not work and then I tried static IP it also didnot work.

I portforwarded and I entered the portal 43594 perfectly as whatportforward.com
guide said at my routar config 192.168.1.1 using my IPV4 address aswell which is 192.168.1.3 then  I saved 
so here is what my portforward looks like:

I went to the firewall and I allowed the port 43594 to work in both TCP and UDP.

and I tried alot of combinations it still won&#39;t work I can&#39;t figure out the problem so please if someone can help me on skype add : godaxe1</description>
