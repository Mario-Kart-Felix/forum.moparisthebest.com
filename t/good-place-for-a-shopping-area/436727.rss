    <title>Good place for a shopping area?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-place-for-a-shopping-area/436727</link>
    <description>Alright so I came up with an idea for my server, and it&#39;s basically like this area where you could buy outfits and unique armor (Assassin outfit, Priest outfit, Ancient Ceremonial armor, etc) It&#39;ll be a few different shops, with different Npcs to fit the theme of the items of the shop. So basically I&#39;m asking:
Where do you think would be a cool place to put this little shopping area? (Sorry if this is in the wrong thread, I&#39;m new here. Cut me some slack)</description>

              <p>Try Port Khazard (2665,3161). It’s stores aren’t too far, it’s super bright, rarely used, plain, no distractions. I love it.</p>

              <p>I’d go for either an island or a place where you have a big open space.</p>
<p>[ul][li]Tutorial island has buildings, large open spaces and looks nice.[/li]<br>
[li]Karamja or another remote place will give you plenty of room as well (if not already used).[/li]<br>
[li]Random event areas are most likely unused so could make a good shopping space.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>In my opinion - if you want players to spend lots of time there - choose somewhere that’s bright, open and doesn’t involve running around trying to find what they want. If they can associate a certain building or landmark with certain shops, it will hopefully save them time and help them to enjoy the facilities. If you’re using a large place, I’d also include multiple portals or ways of getting back.</p>
