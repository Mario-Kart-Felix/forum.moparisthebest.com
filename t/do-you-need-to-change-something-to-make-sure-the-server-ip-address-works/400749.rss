              <p>It’s a very simple process. Simply find out the IP of what the server was previously, and search the entire folder for it (ex. 12.345.67.89) and then replace with either your IP or your No-IP host. If you can’t find what the servers previous IP was, just search for either 127.0.0.1,  0.0.0.0, server =, or no-ip and you should be able to find the IP somewhere in the files. GL with this.</p>
