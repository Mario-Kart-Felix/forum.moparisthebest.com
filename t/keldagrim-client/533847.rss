    <title>Keldagrim Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/keldagrim-client/533847</link>
    <description>So my old Client crashed, (fucked up the cache lel), and now I dl&#39;d Keldagrim Client. I like it as it has fs, and more features. The Problem is I cant connect to it, has nothing to do with the IP, I just have to change something in the RS2LoginProtocolDetector or however this piece of shit is called, that was stated in a Tutorial, My problem is I DONT HAVE THAT FILE.

I do use clean PI.. Thanks in Advance.</description>
