    <title>Rucruiting:Need help running a Runescape server on a web host!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rucruiting-need-help-running-a-runescape-server-on-a-web-host/191494</link>
    <description>I have registered for a free web hosting site at [url=http://eatj.com]eatj.com[/url] which supports java that I want to run our runescape server from!
If this is possible to do I will need a staff who know how to run the server on this site!
If you know something about running java on a website please pm me or post here telling what you know about this sort of thing, and if I like it I will pm you with the username and password of the account on this site so you may help out on making this the best server ever!!!</description>

              <p>I’m afraid you have bought the wrong kind of host, you would need to buy a VPS (virtual private server ) or a dedicated server, i suggest this website: <a href="http://vaserv.com" rel="nofollow noopener">vaserv.com</a> for a VPS server theyre cheap and good quality and have a wide range of OS. I myself have a debian VPS which is working great and it only cost £4 a month.</p>
