I was simply wondering, how RuneScape writes there information in &quot;Pseudocode&quot;, than it converts it&#39;s self into Java? And is it possible to do this with a Private server? If yes, what program(s) would be required to do this?

 Thanks  :rolleyes:</description>

              <p>They don’t write the core engine in RuneScript, that would be silly. It is mainly just their content they write in RuneScript. They just wrote their own lightweight scripting language. The game is still written in Java though.</p>

              <p>From my understanding, Jagex has its own scripting engine that it uses to code. You could only aquire this exact engine by penetrating Jagex HQ and stealing it. You could always write your own, but I haven’t seen a RSPS use it’s own engine</p>
