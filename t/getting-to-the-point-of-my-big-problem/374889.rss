    <description>ok i know i&#39;m posting alot, but i think i found a way that you can all look to understand. If you have like some messaging thing or whatever please message me and we can chat and figure it out but here is what i found out today.

I tried to use a different client and it was the kind that you had to enter the ip, so i did as shown.

Btw the server shown in hamachi was someone elses, not mine XD. Anyways it worked but i got &quot;error_game_js5connect&quot;. So i found this post here----&gt; http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=330293.0    i did the dont enter ip since i doing it locally, since thats what it is. But i got the following error below.

Btw its deltascape and has so much freaking nulls! I followed someone certain advice ;) but when i deleted some nulls i got 100 errors so i put them back. But i really dont know how to get rid of them now. I just going to delete the nulls ONLY in client and server, since thats the codes that are used while starting the server/client. But i just want to see if any of you have ideas.... Now since portforwarding isnt working i using hamachi now, cause it is easier and i&#39;ll learn no-ip later but now its hamachi. 

Now back to the problem. The picture is a problem you aleady seem but i really dont get it. Adn i am STRESSED that my server wwont even get on, cause i put so much coding into the server and i would like to see what it looks like. Below are some of the problems i had in the past and i bet you seen them before.....

Now i using the Rs4ever V4 ipchanger Client, Deltascape client, and some other one that i dont use anymore. And yes i tried ALL portforwarding tutorials and everything worked but still get the errors. Here are my ideas what the problem is.

1.nulls
2.Need new client
3.need to get my hamachi to work
4.need to get my server to work with client

Now If ANY of you ever encountered nulls, not able to get a server to work with client, portforwarding, or any of the problems above please contact bbdoney@aol.com . Now also there is a few more things i need to tell you. I did all the tutorials of the problems i have above in moparscape so just letting you know.

Here is the Compiler and run of both my client/server:

Server:
[img]http://imagegecko.com/images/1tqwnzhvqfyfkddzbv0j.jpg[/img]
[img]http://imagegecko.com/images/7hf0ecu65h91yye1gtg.jpg[/img]

Client:
[img]http://imagegecko.com/images/1i4yjf3kfd1tsb848o.jpg[/img]
[img]http://imagegecko.com/images/7rjzxr6i9ihafzyp5o98.jpg[/img]

Ok well i think thats all i should show. PLEASE email me if you can help or reply this post. I really need to solve this, it is really stressing and i&#39;m starting to give up cause i fail at this apparently. And please explain good, i dont like have to ask you over again and i&#39; bet you dont like it either...

PS: Merry Christmas</description>
