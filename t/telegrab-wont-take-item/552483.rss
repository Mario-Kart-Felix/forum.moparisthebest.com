    <title>TeleGrab won&#39;t take item</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/telegrab-wont-take-item/552483</link>
    <description>So.. when i do the telegrab spell it seems to work like it&#39;s suppose to but the only thing that it&#39;s not doing is grabbing the item, i&#39;m missing a piece of coding that tells it to grab the item from floor any help would be nice!

[code]if (c.goodDistance(c.getX(), c.getY(), itemX, itemY, 12)) {
			
			  int offY = (c.getX() - itemX) * -1; int offX = (c.getY() - itemY)
			   -1; c.teleGrabX = itemX; c.teleGrabY = itemY; c.teleGrabItem =
			  itemId; c.turnPlayerTo(itemX, itemY); c.teleGrabDelay =
			  System.currentTimeMillis();
			  c.startAnimation(c.MAGIC_SPELLS[51][2]);
			  c.gfx100(c.MAGIC_SPELLS[51][3]);
			  c.getPA().createPlayersStillGfx(144, itemX, itemY, 0, 72);
			  c.getPA().createPlayersProjectile(c.getX(), c.getY(), offX, offY,
			  50, 70, c.MAGIC_SPELLS[51][4], 50, 10, 0, 50);
			  c.getPA().addSkillXP(c.MAGIC_SPELLS[51][7], 6);
			  c.getPA().refreshSkill(6); //c.stopMovement();
			 
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Telegrab is disabled.&quot;);
		}
	}

<p>You are very much right, i guess there’s some things i need to actually pay attention too… as for this i knew what the code was just, wasn’t familiar with how to do it with all items instead of just one specific item like coins ect… now i’m gonna have to declare these ID, AMOUNT are they public int or boolean ect…? what are these declared as and where? or do i just re put in the code constantly and type in item id’s and the amounts…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>The values aren’t declared. I was just saying that the ID goes in that field, and the amount in the other.</p>
<p>To get the values, you’d have to look in your server’s ground item array (If it has one, which it should) for the item at the X, Y, and Z that is being used in this code. If the item exists, then delete it from the array, and the ground, then give it to the player.<br>
You <span class="bbcode-i">always</span> want to remove the item from the array before giving it to the player to ensure that they cannot get multiples.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yep that’s exactly the problem right now i’m having, it picks the item up but it never deletes it from ground it’s just there and you can continuously pick up the item.</p>
<p>this is what i added</p>
<p>[code]if (c.goodDistance(c.getX(), c.getY(), itemX, itemY, 12)) {</p>
<pre><code>		  int offY = (c.getX() - itemX) * -1; int offX = (c.getY() - itemY)
		   -1; c.teleGrabX = itemX; c.teleGrabY = itemY; c.teleGrabItem =
		  itemId; c.turnPlayerTo(itemX, itemY); c.teleGrabDelay =
		  System.currentTimeMillis();
		  c.startAnimation(c.MAGIC_SPELLS[51][2]);
		  c.gfx100(c.MAGIC_SPELLS[51][3]);
		  c.getPA().createPlayersStillGfx(144, itemX, itemY, 0, 72);
		  c.getPA().createPlayersProjectile(c.getX(), c.getY(), offX, offY,
		  50, 70, c.MAGIC_SPELLS[51][4], 50, 10, 0, 50);
		  c.getPA().addSkillXP(c.MAGIC_SPELLS[51][7], 6);
		  c.getPA().refreshSkill(6); c.stopMovement();
		  c.getItems().deleteItem(11694, 0);
		  c.getItems().addItem(11694, 1);
	}
