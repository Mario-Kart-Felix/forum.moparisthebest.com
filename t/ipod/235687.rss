    <title>Ipod</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ipod/235687</link>
    <description>My Ipod&#39;s been acting up lately as well. I conected it to my laptop so it could charge and I leave my room only to come back and find that my laptop has the blue screen of death. So I disconnect my Ipod, and now it glitches all the time, like the backlight flashes randomly and songs will cut off and switch at random too.</description>

<p>How old is it? I’ve had mine for a year or so and it sometimes acts strangely. Like freezing, not turning off, not turning on, playing through all the tracks automatically skipping each one until it burns out etc.</p>

<p>I’ve had it since December. The only other problem I had with it was that it thrown into a pool and didn’t work for two month but eventually started working again fine because it dried out.</p>

<p>I got 6 from this site called <a href="http://www.club.live.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.club.live.com</a>, it’s a promotion site for Windows Live. You just play games and earn points. You used to be able to cheat though, which is how I made some nice cash ;]</p>
<p>You can still play legit though, and get a Zune no problem.</p>
