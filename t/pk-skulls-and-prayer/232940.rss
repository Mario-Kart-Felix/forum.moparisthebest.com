    <title>Pk skulls and prayer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-skulls-and-prayer/232940</link>
    <description>I doubt anyone can help me with this...But...

I fixed a few glitched with my PK skulls and prayer. Like it doesn&#39;t sink on your head. However, When you&#39;re skulled and the prayer is on...the prayer is under the skull, when it should be over. Does anyone have a fix for this? Basically I tried swapping the sprites...But that didn&#39;t work so well, maybe I did it wrong.</description>
