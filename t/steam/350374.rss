    <description>Just wondering if anyone can help me out here. I&#39;ve been able to play all my steam games under wine but with this install it&#39;s messed up.
CSS, TF2, L4D2 all end up like this:

I&#39;ve read site after site on how to set it up but none seem to help.

You might be using a new version of WINE that broke compatibility, you might try installing an older version.<br>

Just tried 1.0, Steam wouldn’t even open. I guess I’ll just restart it all from scratch.<br>

Yeah, I found this… I used to be able to run steam through WINE without a problem. A few Ubuntu updates/upgrades ago and I’ve not been able to open steam since…</p>

<p>I can’t see any reason, from the wine output, why it would be crashing… The strange thing is I can type my details etc into the login box fine, it’s just when (I assume) it’s downloading/refreshing the server list.</p>
