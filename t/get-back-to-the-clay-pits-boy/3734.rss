    <description>I found this relatively entertaining article on Runescape will nosing around the net:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Markets. Demand. Supply.

One thing about a virtual economy is that the quick feedback and response and the immediacy and flux of the economy is very evident. In the space of a day I have gone from penniless adventurer to moderate wealth as a &quot;clay supplier.&quot;

A bit of background: several weeks ago my son came home from school very excited about trying a game some of his friends were involved with online: Runescape. Runescape is a virtual world, a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). Runescape, as MMORPG&#39;s go, is strictly at the low end. It is a java-based online game offering a fairly cheap and relatively painless entry point for people who want to try the MMOG but don&#39;t want to dive into the more intensive involved Worlds of Warcraft.

Runescape is set in yet another fantasy world peopled with the usual beasts, monsters, quests, and magic â€” you know the type â€” with a selection of easy monster and creatures on which to hone your skills, and a selection of progressively more difficult quests that help to build your skill level until you can take on the bigger creatures and beasts. (Note: Avoid the Chaos Elemental. I named it the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal after it defenestrated me in the wild.)

The biggest problem in the virtual world is the same as it is in our real world: money. How do you go about earning cash to finance your adventures? It is relatively simple to earn small amounts of gold (chopping wood, mining tin, killing goblins, etc.), but after a time such make-work becomes tedious. Through nosing about, we managed to discover a source of magical runes that we could then sell in one of the towns for 70 gold pieces each.

Aha! Easy Money! So we thought. Each trek out to the site involved a laborious and intensive hike into the wilderness, a region rife with player-killers, generally high-ranking. A direct route was out of the question as far too many homicidal maniacs waited by the main road into the wilderness for some cheap kills. Getting to the site involved a very long and meandering route to avoid the many monsters and other players. Once you finally arrived, you had to daringly dart in to collect as many of the runes as possible, wait for them to respawn, and then collect again. In short, it was a JOB â€” dirty, dangerous and tedious.

Just in case you are wondering, the fatality rate for such expeditions as ours was probably 60%. The return for the survivors was typically about 3000 gold pieces, enough to buy some decent mid-level armour and weapons but not much else.

Enter the Gods of Runescape (i.e. the programmers). They announced two days ago the advent of housing! You can now purchase and build a house, equipping it with elaborate styles, furnishings, and more. This is a great boon for the many higher-level members who, bluntly, have more money then they can spend and like to show off â€” the only real-world value that seems to exist.

Weirdly enough, Runescape characters can neither sit nor sleep, so the elaborate chairs, beds, and furnishings only serve the purpose of showing off wealth, levels, and accomplishments. The incongruity of spending countless hours earning virtual cash to purchase a virtual house and furniture that is just eye-candy is probably appreciated by most, but they still want to do it.

Building your house takes time and construction skills, so raw materials are required. Wood must be cut, turned into planks, transported, and then nailed into chairs, for example. Clay must be mined for use in fireplaces.

The initial frenzy started with realtors. Once the announcement about the housing update was made, members flocked to purchase houses (placed in a magical portal, so they don&#39;t clutter up the landscape) and then flocked to build. A market sprang up within minutes that catered to those too busy, too intent, or too high-level to bother gathering up resources. Planks, nails, clay, rock, tiles, and more suddenly began to command exceptional prices. Clay went from 10 gold pieces to 1000 gold pieces within minutes (right now its hovering between a low of 600 or 700 gold pieces for dry clay to about 1000 gold pieces for wet clay, but the price is fluctuating downwards as the initial demand levels off and more suppliers get in on the action. I expect it will peak again on the weekend as more players become aware of the new function.

The demand appeared, and so did the middlemen who helped supply it. Now I spend my time ferrying between the mining quarry and the portal, lugging clay and hawking it to builders.

In the brief two days the market has existed, the demand from customers has already changed. Initially customers were fully prepared to buy clay straight from the quarry. Now more canny and experienced buyers look for soft clay â€” clay treated with water â€” a process that involves taking the clay to a water source, soaking each individual clay and then trekking back to the portal to sell it. It is interesting to note the downward trend of the clay prices as more suppliers move into the market and customer demands become more sophisticated.

I suspect that after this week, the demand curve will plateau, the prices will drop, and the demand for luxury items, unique crafted items, and stonework will increase, which means it might be best for me to use my capital to build up my stone-working skills to ride the coming wave to even greater heights as a virtual entrepreneur. That is if I can keep my son from wasting our hard-earned profits on such frivolity as mitheral swords and dragon-skin armor. Get back to the clay pits, boy, and leave adventures to those fools with more blade then brains!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I just thought it was interesting to see an adult noobs perspective on Runescape.</description>

<p>Quote from first review on Google:</p>
<blockquote>Teens and tweens, especially boys, will be fascinated by this role-playing game. But parents should look over their shoulders and see what's really going on. Is the player slaying dragons or other humans? Is the name of the game really "Rune-scape" or "Run-Escape"?
<p>It is possible to play this fascinating game without the murder and mayhem, so Runescape gets a cautionary yellow for "know your kid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting…</p>
<p>In my opinion Runescape <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> Run-Escape. It is pointless bullshit. Do you think anybody on their deathbed is going to look back and be proud of how much time they spent entranced by one of Andrew Gowers shitty college projects? If you <span class="bbcode-b">think</span> a little bit you can make your computer play the game for you and then sell off the product in real life. Hmm, the people living in the real world get the money and the people sitting around clicking at a half-formed fantasy world waste their lives. Murder and mayhem forever ;).</p>

              <p>lol, i used clay to get me all they up to lvl 33, then after that i sold it till i was lvl 82(then the price droped too much)</p>
<p>becasue you could bring a bucket i mine clay every hit so i would mine it then make it soft, then until lvl 33 i would make clay fireplaces(then after lvl 33 it was too hard to lvl from that little xp) so i went to sellign it to provide money for my supplies, oak planks are very expensive, but i found a better way for xp, make statues from limestone and clay(since there both free) becasue limestone can be mines then made into bricks using a chisel. then you get about 1k of that and 1k soft clay and that brought me from lvl 39 to lvl 61. from there i simply made stuff using cloth and teal oaks, i spent about 100k on this stuff but in the end i was boosted to lvl 84, so then i needed a better way for xp, i found out that you can make stuff in your workshop to gain more xp, so i went and made statues, got the xp then sold it off for anywhere from 20k to 35k(for something i made for free) that ended up getting me lvl 86 then i had enough money(875k) that i was able to buy gold leafs and teak planks to work on my lvl some more, i made it to lvl 95 with this, but since i was so close i didnt want to quit, so i went off to mine get me a servant, then by using him i was able to tele to varrock mine 15k limestone(very boring) then i went and mined 15k clay also(boring) then i would tele to my house and have my servant get me clay and limstone, then when he got back i would have him get me more supplies while i went off and built(the demand on statues died to much) so i spent three days to get 98 construction and that is where it stays…</p>
<p>thats my guide on how to get your construction level up, without wasting much money(i totaled at 21k spent)</p>
<p>and i spent about 1.3 million total(buying dragons and stuff, but that wasnt in raising my constuction it was was perfecting my house)</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I found this relatively entertaining article on Runescape will nosing around the net:</p>
<blockquote>Markets. Demand. Supply.
<p>One thing about a virtual economy is that the quick feedback and response and the immediacy and flux of the economy is very evident. In the space of a day I have gone from penniless adventurer to moderate wealth as a “clay supplier.”</p>
<p>A bit of background: several weeks ago my son came home from school very excited about trying a game some of his friends were involved with online: Runescape. Runescape is a virtual world, a MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game). Runescape, as MMORPG’s go, is strictly at the low end. It is a java-based online game offering a fairly cheap and relatively painless entry point for people who want to try the MMOG but don’t want to dive into the more intensive involved Worlds of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Runescape is set in yet another fantasy world peopled with the usual beasts, monsters, quests, and magic â€” you know the type â€” with a selection of easy monster and creatures on which to hone your skills, and a selection of progressively more difficult quests that help to build your skill level until you can take on the bigger creatures and beasts. (Note: Avoid the Chaos Elemental. I named it the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal after it defenestrated me in the wild.)</p>
<p>The biggest problem in the virtual world is the same as it is in our real world: money. How do you go about earning cash to finance your adventures? It is relatively simple to earn small amounts of gold (chopping wood, mining tin, killing goblins, etc.), but after a time such make-work becomes tedious. Through nosing about, we managed to discover a source of magical runes that we could then sell in one of the towns for 70 gold pieces each.</p>
<p>Aha! Easy Money! So we thought. Each trek out to the site involved a laborious and intensive hike into the wilderness, a region rife with player-killers, generally high-ranking. A direct route was out of the question as far too many homicidal maniacs waited by the main road into the wilderness for some cheap kills. Getting to the site involved a very long and meandering route to avoid the many monsters and other players. Once you finally arrived, you had to daringly dart in to collect as many of the runes as possible, wait for them to respawn, and then collect again. In short, it was a JOB â€” dirty, dangerous and tedious.</p>
<p>Just in case you are wondering, the fatality rate for such expeditions as ours was probably 60%. The return for the survivors was typically about 3000 gold pieces, enough to buy some decent mid-level armour and weapons but not much else.</p>
<p>Enter the Gods of Runescape (i.e. the programmers). They announced two days ago the advent of housing! You can now purchase and build a house, equipping it with elaborate styles, furnishings, and more. This is a great boon for the many higher-level members who, bluntly, have more money then they can spend and like to show off â€” the only real-world value that seems to exist.</p>
<p>Weirdly enough, Runescape characters can neither sit nor sleep, so the elaborate chairs, beds, and furnishings only serve the purpose of showing off wealth, levels, and accomplishments. The incongruity of spending countless hours earning virtual cash to purchase a virtual house and furniture that is just eye-candy is probably appreciated by most, but they still want to do it.</p>
<p>Building your house takes time and construction skills, so raw materials are required. Wood must be cut, turned into planks, transported, and then nailed into chairs, for example. Clay must be mined for use in fireplaces.</p>
<p>The initial frenzy started with realtors. Once the announcement about the housing update was made, members flocked to purchase houses (placed in a magical portal, so they don’t clutter up the landscape) and then flocked to build. A market sprang up within minutes that catered to those too busy, too intent, or too high-level to bother gathering up resources. Planks, nails, clay, rock, tiles, and more suddenly began to command exceptional prices. Clay went from 10 gold pieces to 1000 gold pieces within minutes (right now its hovering between a low of 600 or 700 gold pieces for dry clay to about 1000 gold pieces for wet clay, but the price is fluctuating downwards as the initial demand levels off and more suppliers get in on the action. I expect it will peak again on the weekend as more players become aware of the new function.</p>
<p>The demand appeared, and so did the middlemen who helped supply it. Now I spend my time ferrying between the mining quarry and the portal, lugging clay and hawking it to builders.</p>
<p>In the brief two days the market has existed, the demand from customers has already changed. Initially customers were fully prepared to buy clay straight from the quarry. Now more canny and experienced buyers look for soft clay â€” clay treated with water â€” a process that involves taking the clay to a water source, soaking each individual clay and then trekking back to the portal to sell it. It is interesting to note the downward trend of the clay prices as more suppliers move into the market and customer demands become more sophisticated.</p>
<p>I suspect that after this week, the demand curve will plateau, the prices will drop, and the demand for luxury items, unique crafted items, and stonework will increase, which means it might be best for me to use my capital to build up my stone-working skills to ride the coming wave to even greater heights as a virtual entrepreneur. That is if I can keep my son from wasting our hard-earned profits on such frivolity as mitheral swords and dragon-skin armor. Get back to the clay pits, boy, and leave adventures to those fools with more blade then brains!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just thought it was interesting to see an adult noobs perspective on Runescape.</p>
