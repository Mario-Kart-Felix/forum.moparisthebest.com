    <description>Several Questions:

I&#39;m having trouble getting certain NPC&#39;s to talk in game. I don&#39;t know how to get them working. Sorry for the nooby question but I&#39;m new to this LOL. Thanks!

How do I get the master fisher to talk and give out fish?

I have portals added, but they won&#39;t teleport. How do I make em teleport?</description>
