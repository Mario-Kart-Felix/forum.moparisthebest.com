They aren’t very similar at all. Dry ice has a temperature of −78.5 °C, liquid nitrogen’s temperature is roughly −210 °C. Liquid nitrogen is hard to come by and incredibly unsafe to be using.<br>

              <p>I can’t sleep at night because of that micro atx, i need to change it. Nothing wrong with performance, it’s just i don’t like that it’s micro. I can easily sell it and with a few extra bucks get a nicer H97 ATX mobo, not OC’ing anymore.</p>
<p>I got two choices that i like:</p>
<p>MSI H97 GAMING 3 ; for 185$<br>
ASUS H97 PRO GAMER ; for 200$</p>
<p>The MSI mobo has nice ratings and reviews from people but the asus one even though with it’s reliable reputation, it’s a new mobo and not many have tried it yet with no ratings at all?</p>

Overclocking may be simple, but it takes time. I believe the world record overclock took days using some liquid nitrogen, which I think is dry ice. So, if you keep failing your overclocking, then keep trying and expect the worst.[/quote]<br>
Liquid nitrogen isn’t anything like dry ice just fyi bruh</p>

<p>I never OC’ed it actually, tried to do so but it was too complicated for me as i’m not familiar with OC’ing at all.<br>
So i just sold it and borrowed some money from my bro to be ablee to get this one lol.</p>
<p>Seriously it’s really not worth it…</p>
<p>I’m also planning on changing the mobo, the guilt is killing me for buying a micro, probably not soon just planning ahead. I got my eyes on the asus gamer pro. What would you give to go with that CPU?</p>
