    <title>2 Questions About Saving and Voids</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-questions-about-saving-and-voids/107378</link>
    <description>Okay, so, whenever I try adding something to save for my Server, and I compile and everything, I log in and all that happened what that my player lost its look and went back to the original character look. So basically it&#39;s not saving and it results in an error. Can you think of any reasons of why this would be happening?

Second, I am trying to make a command to send a message to a certain player, and to do that I need to make a void. I know how to start the void and all, but I don&#39;t know what all this stuff does and how to use it:
[code]   outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(34); // init item to smith screen
   outStream.writeWord(column); // Column Across Smith Screen
   outStream.writeByte(4); // Total Rows?
   outStream.writeDWord(slot); // Row Down The Smith Screen
   outStream.writeWord(id+1); // item
   outStream.writeByte(amount); // how many there are?
   outStream.endFrameVarSizeWord();
[/code] And stuff like that. So, I would like someone to explain all that if possible. This is really the only way to make this command work so... thanks. :)</description>
