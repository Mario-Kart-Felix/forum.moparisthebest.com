    <title>My Melee Is Ruined - Can Anyone Help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-melee-is-ruined-can-anyone-help/104851</link>
    <description>I think I messed around with my combat too much a while back, can someone really help me and give me any pieces of client.java that relate to melee combat. The last thing I remember was making both players face each other, so if you can find that in your client.java, can you give me the code around it?

I use a Phonescape source, but if it still works I&#39;ll use any other.</description>
