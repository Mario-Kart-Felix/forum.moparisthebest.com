    <description>Sphynx-Scape is back! and that means it&#39;s time for us to kick off our 1st update - Class items!
Class items are special items, designed on how you battle.

Only has claws/ags, none of that Korasi bull. PKing is straight forward and beautiful. Also, there is a PK&#39;ing level, for those hardcore people who just love to whipe the floor with everyone!

-----------------------------------------------------
SCROLL DOWN FOR SPECIAL EVENT
-----------------------------------------------------

There are 6 different classes so far:

Tactician - High attack rating
Berserker - Less defence, high strength rating
Mage - High magic rating
Paladin - Good defence, good prayer bonus
Archer - High range rating
Defender - Great defence rating, less strength

Each class item is color coordinated,
For example, the Berserker&#39;s cape:
[img]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=553856.0;attach=21405;image[/img]

Red: Berserker items
Green: Archer items
Blue: Tactician items
Cyan: Defender items
Yellow: Paladin items
White: Mage items

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C L A S S    R O L L S                          - S P H Y N X - S C A P E -
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Roles:

Defender (Tank): Obviously, you want your guy that&#39;s decked out in defender gear to snag the main boss that you&#39;re fighting, and keep alive while other people attack.
Paladin (Off-Tank): Without sacking damage, Paladins will have a much easier time taking on multiple enemies because of their increased prayer bonus (Protection prayers are very effective against groups, but their def isn&#39;t strong enough for mobs that hit through).
Berserker (DPS): Increased STR, although their def is hugely in the negative, and if they have mobs on them, they&#39;re likely to die. Their main goal is to ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK, while hopefully going un-noticed.
Tactician (DPS): A very precise warrior, making sure that he scores not only hits, but maximum hits as much as possible. They&#39;d be best attacking the boss, and fending off a few add mobs.
Archer (DPS): An archer will be best prepared for ranged combat, getting himself out of harmsway during big battles.
Mage (DPS-Healing): A mages job is to help keep the tank alive (With lunar magic), or damage the hell out of what ever it is they&#39;re killing.

If the class is pitted in PvP, however...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defenders will try and outlast their opponents, by blocking hits and scoring some decent damage.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tacticians will hope to combo their opponents to death, not allowing them a chance to eat or run.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Berserkers will attempt to finish off their foes quickly, hoping to avoid blows.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paladins will strike at the opponents prayer, while boasting prayer bonus and defence.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mages will try to go after melee masters, such as defenders and tacticians, killing them with stuns and confusion.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Archers will hope to get the element of surprise, and kill their foes before they know what hit em&#39;.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>Training is normal, it is still RuneSape.</p>
<p>Classes aren’t precisely enforced, there are simply class items.<br>
However, obviously a person in full cyan (defender) gear is only going to be used for defence, and will claim to be a defender, whereas a person in full red (berserker) gear is going to be a berserker.</p>
