              <p>Well, it says that when the character first logs in. Then you can go and play, but when you log out. It doesn’t save the file, well, or atleast not after a while. When I was working on this version, I logged on and it said that, then I done some stuff, and logged off and it said that it had saved the game for my account. Then a little later on that night, it would send a message that it could not save my account when you log off… and it hasn’t since.</p>
<p>There’s a command in the server like um, ::backup or something that like that would supposably save your character, but I havn’t got it to work for me so…</p>
