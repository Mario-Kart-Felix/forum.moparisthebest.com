    <title>About Reines&#39;s RSCD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-reiness-rscd/360634</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;ve always been wondering one thing. Back when Reines hosted original RSCDaemon, then how secure was it? Were dupes common?(since in v4 and neither in v25 there are many of the simplest dupes unfixed) How stabile was it? Was the version later released by PR4Y the exact same version Reines used? Why Reines decided to stop?

These are the questions I&#39;d like to be answered, thanks in advance.</description>

<p>Because demonik wasn’t ran by Jamie. In the same way that things RSCDv25 didn’t have, have been added to servers, ran by people such as Luke or xEnt.</p>

</aside>
<p>There was no NPC called Rick? In fact there was no custom NPC what-so-ever as far as I can remember… If we had the latest client build the NPC would be in the client cache don’t remember. I’m not sure where you got that I renamed a NPC to Luke either?[/quote]<br>
Yes, there was. The NPC is called Luke IIRC on RSCE and is located in Seers. He certs flax and bow strings. He was named after a player on RSCDaemon (Rick) who was a high level woodcutter or fletcher. I know there’s an NPC on your server that certs flax and bow strings, but is at different coords than the one Reines implemented in RSCDaemon.</p>
