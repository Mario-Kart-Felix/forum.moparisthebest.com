    <title>U.S engineered civil war in Iraq</title>

    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The US-sponsored Shia assault on the Sunnis gave al-Qaeda a new opportunity. In mid-2005, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, announced the creation of a special unit, the Omar Brigade, to combat the Shia commando torture and death squads. That led to the massive sectarian bloodletting in Baghdad in 2006, when thousands of civilians were dying every month.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Read the full article to see how the U.S stirred up the civil war to help them win a war they were losing.


Edit: Found something interesting

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Samho Dream supertanker was hijacked in the Indian Ocean in April and its crew of five South Koreans and 19 Filipinos were taken hostage. [b]It was carrying crude oil worth $170m (£105m) from Iraq to the US[/b]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<blockquote>To those who will decry this as censorship, they should be reminded of President Bush's injunction shortly after we were attacked two years ago: In the War on Terror, you are either with us or with the terrorists. It would be no more sensible for us to construe the masquerading of enemy propaganda, the communication and amplification of its calls to jihad and the legitimacy that attends transmission of such messages and images via television than it would be for us to regard bin Laden's messages, or Saddam's, as mere "news."
<p>If we are serious about this war, we need a totally revamped information policy – replete with much more concerted and effective efforts to win the hearts and minds of people who have no reason to fear us, let alone to attack us, but are being told to do so by Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. A place to start would be to rapidly start up a satellite television service of our own, capable of reaching millions of currently unserved viewers in Iraq.<br>
In the meantime, it is imperative that enemy media be taken down if they insist on using their access to the airwaves as instruments of the war against us and our allies.</p>

I’m sorry, but you guys refuse to read links from fox news because you think it is skewed, but you will read links from freaking aljazeera?  Like it is a fair and unbiased news source or something?  Come on!  Do you guys also do research for your job or school on wikipedia?..<br>

<p>Why do you equate Al Jazeera to Wikipedia?[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not trying to equate them.  I’m saying that thinking aljazeera is a fair and unbiased news source is like citing wikipedia on a research paper, both are the wrong thing to do.  Perhaps it was a far fetched analogy.  Either way, aljazeera is certainly worse than fox news ever even thought about being.</p>

<p>It isn’t about what Fox news is ‘fighting for’, it is the way they do it. They have so much power that they should be forced to bring their arguments forward in a more dignified and responsible manner. At the moment they just appear to be throwing shit at the wall, no matter how far fetched and stupid it sounds, and hoping something sticks so they can continue with their bullshit parade.</p>

Oh yea, props on using Aljazeera. Why is it that when i Google for a half an hour on the subject i can only find links to Aljazeera and Muslim forums linking to the matter and no reports made by any other news outlets or countries? Are you still in denial that its a possibility that these news sources are tainted by threats/bribes from anti American organizations like Al Qaeda?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, it’s clearly just muslims who hold this viewpoint. The Guardian in the UK for example, doesn’t exist at all.</p>
<p>Is that a normal tactic, btw? Pretending news sources that don’t agree with you just don’t exist?[/quote]<br>
What the hell are you talking about? I googled this exact news article and there were no other news places that reported it at all. Im not ignoring the opposing. But if thinking that makes you feel vastly superior then by all means bathe in your ignorance.</p>

<p>Oh yea, props on using Aljazeera. Why is it that when i Google for a half an hour on the subject i can only find links to Aljazeera and Muslim forums linking to the matter and no reports made by any other news outlets or countries? Are you still in denial that its a possibility that these news sources are tainted by threats/bribes from anti American organizations like Al Qaeda?</p>

<p>Yes, it’s clearly just muslims who hold this viewpoint. The Guardian in the UK for example, doesn’t exist at all.</p>
<p>Is that a normal tactic, btw? Pretending news sources that don’t agree with you just don’t exist?</p>
<p>EDIT: Fuck it, I’ll preempt it. Yes, when you google them you will find the tagline “the worlds leading liberal voice”. No, that doesn’t mean shit. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
