    <description>okay I was playing Dodian (Danno&#39;s Client) just a few minutes ago, wanted to get some ideas for my server. I discovered a giant boxing ring in seers where the party building is suppose to be... I&#39;ve never seen anything like that in a client before. I know how the objects are created etc., and how they removed the building. But I&#39;m just wondering, is there any possible way I can get that object into my server without actually designing the model myself?</description>
