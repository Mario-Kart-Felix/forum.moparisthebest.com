    <description>Ok i am really bored so i am going to start this topic. Uhm i still remember my first day in 6th grade and my friends that sat beside me talking about &quot;transfering gold&quot; didnt really know what they were talking about and they told me about runescape. So that day i came home and started playing but i was really confused and didnt know what to do just ran around collecting bones in pvp worlds to make money:$ . Lol i was such a noob but thats how i found out about runescape. Go ahead and share how you started playing runescape?</description>

              <p>When I was on 2nd grade and saw someone play the game(It was RSC), I wanted to try it out and fell in love with it.<br>
My very first account was called “Ali G040”, I played with it untill I learnt what’s a pure, and about PKing, quests, money making, training etc. My next account was called “Sn00p D0gg1” it was pure ranged and well…It had 30-40 ranged and I made new account.</p>
<p>“Blackpure57”, I mostly trained skills on it and did quests on it, I achieved about 76+ fishing with it just by fishing lobsters and salmon.</p>
<p>After that I found bots and made a new character “I 0wn ur ass” botted it to 1 1 50 at goblins, went PKing with the wooden shield and bronze longsword(&lt;3), and got pwned. The character got hacked when RSC got closed, so I recovered it and found out that the idiot who hacked it had trained it to flat 90s and woodcutting like 96, but left nothing in the bank.</p>
<p>By the time RSC got closed I started playing RS2(Think it was around 317ish) and made account ‘L E E Tz’, this was the account I used to explore the much changed world of RS, and then I continued to make new accs, because I like to be low lvl(Love the PKing&lt;3), the max combat level I’ve had is 90 with an account that got banned for botting.</p>
<p>I recovered Ali G040 recently after 2482 days:<br>

              <p>[quote=“baddy351, post:33, topic:422364”]Well, I shall say my whole runescape story now. I am three and my brother (who is 6 years older) is playing “runescape”. Being three, I was still incrediably smart (knew my multiplication tables already, and could read). Anyways, I asked him what he was playing or something, and after hours upon hours of watching him I used to get on his account. (All I could really type back then was the username and password, couldn’t type at all, he would type for me). This led up to when I was 6 making my own account. I used to use his name (Runeruler) and just put random 3 numbers infront of it. I know I have a few good accounts out there, just can’t remember the name. (keep in mind, rs2 beta just came out a little while ago.). Eventually I decided to make an account with my own name when I was 8, I still hate this name and want it changed but its me. I thought I was a badass 8 year old, and made the name baddy351 (the 351 is just because its a beautiful number). I played for a long time, then at 10 discovered runescape private servers. I started out with “Godz Hell” and thought it was the coolest ever! I eventually decided I wanted my own, and found out about moparscape (Correction, found out about the client first, and loved spawning). These last 3 years I really got into java, and am now decent in it. That is my life/runescape story.</p>
<p>~Quick Edit~ Sorry about the blob it looks like, I typed the whole thing in the quick reply box. Might make it look beautiful later…[/quote]<br>
Where is the part about where you create the formula to solve all the medical issues at 15? And the part where you become president and try to make peace in the middle east?</p>

              <p>A couple of my friends at school was playing RuneScape. I asked them, “What’s that?” They wrote down the link on a piece of paper. Then they said, add me on RuneScape. I said, “Okay…” I was very unsure of what this meant at the time. Then I got home from school, got on the website back in 2009, and I got really addicted to it! I also didn’t know how to make money cause i was a newb :P… I always begged for money and falled for scams… and I thank myself for falling for scams… Cause now i don’t fall for ANY at all :rolleyes:! I also got hacked by this guy on RuneScape called, “EdmerTheHoly”… his password was the same as my account when he hacked my account… pretty funny :P. I tried it on his account, and the password worked! It was Ommar btw… but yea… that’s my runescape story <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

I remember not knowing what Ty meant, and since my other cousin, (the one who played RS with me, it was her brother), I called him Ty so it was pretty confusing until I googled it and found it means thank you.  Also, sorry if that short little paragraph was hard to read.  I feel like I typed it all stupid.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Phaze One, post:10, topic:349810”]Started back when I was around 10 back in 2004 my friend told me he was playing this game which I thought was called ‘Run Escape’. He asked me to join so after school I googled this run escape game and the top result was Runescape. He told me to use a random name generator which I did and created an account called ‘XRaider2’. I spent about two months on this account until one day I saw some guy buying accounts so I sold him my back-up account for an Adamant axe and three gold bars. Being the 11 year old I was I used the same password for both accounts which he quickly discovered and unfortunately stole my account.</p>
<p>After that I quit Runescape not really caring too much until a family friend offered me an account. It had 40 something Smithing so I used this account for a while. My parents offered to purchase me membership and I played on that account until I was around 13. When I was 13 I was introduced to private servers which I thought was the coolest thing in the world. Because I had no use for Runescape I gave my account to my cousin and said he can use it but not change the password. Unfortunately he quit Runescape about a year later and we both forgot the password and he changed the recovery questions and lost them so no more account. Here is a picture:</p>

<p>So I pretty much gave up on Runescape after that, concentrated on private servers and such but recently started working on account called ‘Asert One’. So I’m hoping to get all my favourite things back I earned on Dylan982 such as legends cape, 200 something quest points, full grey pirate outfit etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>Update since then: I’m maxed l0l</p>

              <p>It was around summer 2005 when an american guy that used to visit his relatives @ my village came to the internet cafe, we were playing some spaceship games then. We saw him log on to this game RuneScape and we watched for a while and then we registered. My friends found it interesting but it looked like crap to me for some reason and so I wanted to stick with Jagex’s other games lol, they had them on rs page for a while i think or maybe it was <a href="http://jagex.com" rel="nofollow noopener">jagex.com</a></p>
<p>After about 2 weeks of watching them play I said let’s give it a try and now here I am. I also remember playing RS from <a href="http://miniclip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">miniclip.com</a> a few times. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"> Is it still there?</p>
