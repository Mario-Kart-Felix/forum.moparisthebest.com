    <description>[s]Hello Moparscape!


As you may have noticed I took a 2 week break from RSPS due to me being pissed off and backstabbed over and over again. I am back and want to start a development. This will not be a normal development so you may want to stay and read the following.

What I want: I want a newer server preferably 718 or higher maybe even 723 with an active community running on VPS.
What I need: Someone able to donate that will take the place as in-game OWNER. Yes, Owner, Not co-owner.
What I will be doing: I will be coding and be in-game not often but I will be in-game. I will still have a larger say then you will have.



What do you want to be?
Owner?
Coder With Me?
Moderator?
Administrator?


How to apply?

Age:
Position applying for:
Ability to donate:

- First 100% dicing in 667.
- First complete jad on 667, all waves.
- Owned server called Demolitions for 2 years now.
