    <title>Making Shortcut for Something Donwloaded in WinAce</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-shortcut-for-something-donwloaded-in-winace/105517</link>
    <description>How do I access something that I have downloaded in WinAce, or make a shortcut for something I&#39;ve got open. Because I have just downloaded PSCS3 Portable from rapidshare, and it opened with WinAce. I closed WinAce, but kept Photoshop open, but now I realised if I turn off the computer, I won&#39;t know how to get back to Photoshop. Please help,
Coke.</description>
