    <description>If you have  private server running with a cummity like example

dodian/frugooscape quit big cummity if they get caught by jagex?
will it be shutted down and do you have to pay a high amount of bill to jagex
for copyrighted material? 

iam wondering this because kasparscape got closed and he said he got a message send
with a police officer and he had to close down server and promise never to do again 
or he had high bills i dont know if this story is treu but why should owner make a joke like that?
when he has over 100hundreds of players?</description>
