<p>That is a great question. I can’t make you believe me, but when I say that this remake is not just going to be another failure like 90% of the other remakes I honestly believe that from the bottom of my heart. I’m going to do whatever it takes to succeed, actions speak louder than words though and I’m going to prove with the content that myself(Kieran) and the development team bring out that 06Prime is no joke.</p>
