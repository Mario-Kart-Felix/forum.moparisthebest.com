    <title>Deleting the Ancient Magic Tab Left Of The Friends List Tab. -Project Czar</title>

    <description>     I&#39;ve edited this source so much it barely looks like Czar anymore. But the thing is, I can&#39;t get the stupid Ancient Tab to delete that&#39;s left of the Friends List Smiley (The tab with nothing on it) I&#39;ve search setSidebarInterface and all that bull and I can&#39;t find it in there. I&#39;ve found two that I know of and that&#39;s one for the Ancient altar and the other for the Npc Dark Mage(His doesn&#39;t work.)

     How do I remove the Ancient Magics on the blank tab next to the friends list? e.i. I click on the tab left of the friends list happy face and it shows the ancients, how do I remove that so I can add in the ancient altar and stuff so people have to pray there to get ancient magic?

     I know I search setSidebarInterface and I have but there&#39;s only npcDialogue that changes my regular magic to ancients and that&#39;s the dark mage and talking to him only brings up a shop, so it doesn&#39;t work, then I found one that does it for the ancient altar. It works, but I don&#39;t want the Ancient Spells on that empty tab left of the friends list tab.</description>
