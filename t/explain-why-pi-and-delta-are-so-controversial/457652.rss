    <description>Which is better? PI or Delta, and why?

I always liked PI a lot more just because I&#39;m more familiar with it, but I&#39;m curious as to why everyone constantly bickers over it..</description>

              <h2>Okay!<br>
I found a load of information. Here’s what I got. Credits to the people who made this stuff below.</h2>
<p>BlakeMan8192 was responsible for the below information:<br>
"<br>
The history is very hazy, as Kaitnieks and the other important places in the history of RSPS are now gone.</p>
<p>As far as we know, this is the first RS2 private server ever made: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/origrs2/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/origrs2/</a></p>
<p>It was developed by wL, and it’s known commonly as the “winterlove” server base.</p>
<p>After that release, Daiki took it and through lots of research/development, made a multiplayer server called BlakeScape.</p>
<p>BlakeScape is the grandfather of RuneScape private servers.</p>
<p>At that moment, things start to get blurry as dozens of programmers took the original BlakeScape and developed their bases off of it. The main release that emerged from the original BlakeScape was called MythScape.<br>
Wolf then took MythScape and built several versions of WhtieScape, which Xerozcheez then used to make Cheezscape. Cheezscape was the dominating server base in the 2007 era, the last version being Cheezscape 80.<br>
After this line of servers up to Cheezscape, they were split into three highly popular bases: Project 16, Testscape, and Dodian. Dodian didn’t emerge until later, and originally it was just Project 16 and Testscape for a long time.</p>
<p>From Dodian came Devolution, and then DeltaScape (which is currently the most popular server base). From Testscape emerged Pimpscape, which has now died out for the most part.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering about how well I know this stuff, I’m responsible for the RuneFusion, RuneFusion Final Build, and Enkrona servers on that chart. Enkrona had several versions (2.5, 2.6, and 3.2 I believe were all released to the mainstream) that aren’t mentioned on this chart. Not to toot my own horn, but I’ve also been around RSPS for quite a while now.</p>
<p>Many people have made attempts to re-create the original server base (some examples in chronological order: Google by me and Graham, rs2d by Varek, rs2hd by Graham, Hyperion by Graham, 317serv by Yz85Racer, Casey, and rs377d by me, Apollo by Graham which is not yet released, and I’ve developed several unreleased servers from scratch, including Osiris) with something more stable and efficient than BlakeScape, but most of them have either failed or their server bases have failed to gain mainstream attention. My theory is that their server bases are too complicated for a majority of programmers to use, and hopefully I’ll be solving this problem soon with an open-source server I’ve been working on in my spare time known as RuneSource. It’s meant to resemble the original BlakeScape, but be far more stable, scalable, and efficient.</p>
<p>Hopefully that answers some of your questions! I’m glad to see genuine interest in our history.</p>
<p>Flow chart credit to Graham:</p>
<p><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/9421/treek.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Wow. I’m tired from putting all that together. At least it’s here. Someone should sticky in a relevant place… &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p><img src="http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/1170/timelineh.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Some history of significant server releases (in chronological order):<br>
winterlove (first release)<br>
blakescape (multiplayer)<br>
mythscape (some early content)<br>
cheezscape (combat, npcs, etc)<br>
whitescape (improved content)<br>
p16 (even more improved content)<br>
rs2dv (entire new release)<br>
hyperion (first commercial scale performance release)</p>

<p>There really isn’t a hierarchical family tree of what servers came first. You could go on different communities and check the post dates of releases and get some what of a time line. Don’t forget Dodain either, I’m to young to know about it personally, but I’ve heard stories.<br>

<p>Dodian?*<br>
I played that for a while when I was younger… It got huge. I didn’t much like it because it became like a really overcrowded Runescape. The people didn’t really fix glitches either. I heard it got shut down or something…&gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>Anyways. Thanks! I’ll go find post dates, and create as much of a family tree as I can. I’ll take what I find and post it somewhere on these forums if I’m successful. :D[/quote]</p>
<p>Myself and meiscooldude has plans to somewhat make a database with some form of timeline of RSPS releases, however we’ve never really discussed it any further. It goes into a lot more depth than what you have listed there.</p>

              <p>Most servers today are more or less based off of the Winterlove release back in 05/06, the only real difference is the cobbled mess of code just grew by 10mbs. Though to the other side a lot of frameworks released use parts of the WinterLove architecture. Most notably the player / npc updating.</p>

<p>I keep hearing about wL, and I’m assuming it’s a really fucking laggy old version of Delta/PI?</p>
<p>I need to see some kind of family tree.  (or if I learn enough, I’ll make one…)</p>
