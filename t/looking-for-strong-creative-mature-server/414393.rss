    <title>[Looking For] Strong, Creative, Mature Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-strong-creative-mature-server/414393</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m Mike and I&#39;m 16 years of age.

I&#39;m currently looking for a Strong, Creative, Mature server that&#39;s willing to take the following:

Administrator (all around administrative work from instructions from a higher rank or just a suggestion from a lower rank)
Community Management (ideally dealing with Ban/Mute(IP) unfair gameplay issues) 
Moderator (in-game moderator, keeping things clean)
Forum Moderator (forums moderator, keeping things clean and solid)

If you are interested, I use skype and I am on skype everyday. 

Please, feel free to contact me and we can discuss something out.

I do also have a forums if you are wishing to start a new server. 

*Note* I&#39;m not a good coder, I generally am a friendly person that&#39;s open minded. 

Skype= Mikemikemike194
Forums (that I created) = RS-Legacy.Tk

Thanks. :)

(Edit) I am open to all offers and will review them thoroughly.</description>

              <p>[quote=“Mike194, post:3, topic:414393”]Well, I’m open to all servers as mentioned before, only issue is I do not have a server staff team, but I am looking for one that’s willing to go far in a private server. As the domain, I only use Dot.Tk just for the beginning of things, as it’s a lot easier to save you money until you start gaining players and have a active community.</p>
<p>If you would like to start one, that would be amazing, like I mentioned before, I’m not a coder, but I’m swell with players and (you’ve probably heard this millions of times) active. ;)[/quote]Oh… I thought you were making a server xD Uhh, you should probably just go around looking for teams who need you.</p>

<p>No one likes “Mature” servers, cause it ends up that admins are usually like that… Just my view of things, if ya don’t like it ignore it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>On Topic:<br>
What type of server and what revision? I can see this going far as long as you guys aren’t like the little story I posted above. Almost perfect grammar, only thing ya need is an actual domain and your well on your way! Good luck!</p>
