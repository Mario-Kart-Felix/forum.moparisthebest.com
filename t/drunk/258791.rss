<p>It’s hard to stop yourself from drinking more, when you are drunk. If you have a big bottle of liquor, it’s not hard to end up like those people. Anytime I get “too drunk to move” is a complete accident. I usually just drink beer, it would be hard to get that drunk in the time frame of a party. But with liquor, it is way too easy to get that drunk. And as you get more and more drunk, you drink it as if it was water. I don’t know how to explain it, but when your drunk you always want more. And when you get too drunk, your judgement is especially bad for this. The only way I can cut myself from more is if I genuinely feel like shit and puke all over.</p>

<p>I can feel when I’ve had too much. I get a slight stomachache, so I drink some non-alcohol containing beverages for a few rounds. Especially when I drink beer, I drink some coke too as it gives you new energy.</p>

I do it because it creates epic Lol’s in the morning/during it. I don’t drink till I throw up, I drink till I feel a little nauseous and continue the night from there. Don’t have to prove myself to my friends… We get drunk 'cause it creates a more easy going, fun night.</p>

Haha that last one reminds me of my grandpa. Something similar happened and somehow a large part of his ear ripped off.<br>
[/quote]<br>
His ear got ripped of because he was sleeping on a broken toilet while he was drunk? What way do you sit on a toilet over there?[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t know how it happened at all. He passed out drunk on the toilet and fell off and woke up missing half an ear, at my cottage.</p>
