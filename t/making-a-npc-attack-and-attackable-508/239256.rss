    <title>Making a npc attack and attackable[508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-a-npc-attack-and-attackable-508/239256</link>
    <description>I am using a 508 server and a 508 client.

Questions:
1. Making a npc able to be attacked and killed.

For example a king black dragon. When one is spawned i can not attack it, this goes for any other monster.
I have read through a number of .java files. Npc.java, NPClist.java, and a few more.

I have tried a few things in the npc.CFG files, i made sure the npc was in it, had a combat level, hp, but nothing in there affected it.

2. Anyone have a npc list with the npc id&#39;s.</description>
