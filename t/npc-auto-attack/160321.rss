    <description>Hai, i was wondering how to make npcs auto attack the closest player within a certain area..

I&#39;ve seen on like 1 server, where abyssal leeches auto attack you, and keep following until you are out of that area.

Can someone show me how this would look :|? I have no idea.</description>
