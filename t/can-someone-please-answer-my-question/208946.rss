    <description>Howdy,
How are you all doing? My question is how come when when I tried to run the script (Bumfughter pro 1.1 made by Bumis) I got this code &quot;[Error] (56:51): Duplicate identifier &#39;UpChars&#39; in script C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.15\includes\ssi2.txt&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;ve downloaded all the included and I have read through tutorials but have yet to find the answer.
Thank You ahead of time for whoever answers my question.
Cheers

PS. Sorry for any spelling/grammer mistakes... not my best subject  :D</description>

              <p>Unfortunately that script is very outdated and as you can tell is no longer compatible with the current SCAR.<br>
Also that include is very outdated and I don’t know how you got it unless you got it straight off Freddy’s archive</p>
<p>You should get SRL, It’s the most up to date and current include for SCAR scripts &amp; Scripters.<br>
Also look for some more up to date Scripts, one’s for the current SRL Revision</p>
