Hey there,</p>
<p>An VPS (virtual private server) is like a computer which you can open up on your own computer.<br>
This ‘computer’ is always (except if your hosters stops it) online. Now this is quite expensive for some people<br>
since you buy a good vps for like 15$ a month. If you gain more players then i suggest you use a better vps (like 30-40$)<br>
so it is better secured by DDOSER’s and can hold more players.</p>
<p>Now there are tons of guides on how to setup an VPS and with google you should find it in no time.<br>
For good vps hosting sites I should also just search on mopar since you are not the first one with this question.</p>
<p>[/quote] You can never fully protect from DDoS attacks.[/quote]</p>
<p>If you would read my post more carefully you will notice that i said: it is better secured by DDOSER’s</p>
<p>Still dont see it?<br>
One sec i will type  slowly: b e t t e r</p>
