    <description>hey guys so i got a few questions. first is i have it set so that when you start you can choose between 4 different modes. i want to make it so that a certain group can use commands that other groups cant..how would i do this on a [PI] source?

it makes the group in the character files and each group has its own exp rate but i want the hardest to have a command

extremeMode = true

thats the line in the character files that lets it know that thats the mode its on..and i tried this:


[code]		if(playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;extreme&quot;)) {
		if(&quot;extremeMode = true&quot;){
                c.getItems().addItem(3757, 1);
		} else {
		return;
}
}[/code]

that didnt work and i also tried:

[code]		if(playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;extreme&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerextremeMode == true) {
                c.getItems().addItem(3757, 1);
}[/code]

neither worked..any help?</description>

              <p>[quote=“The Web Guy, post:2, topic:463428”]Hmm, personally I would set it up so that a number defines the rank. So have character-mode saved in the character files and have say mode 4 be extreme mode. So you can do something like this:</p>
<p><code>
	if(playerCommand.startsWith("extreme")) {
		if("mode = 4") {
			c.getItems().addItem(3757, 1);
		} else {
		 sendMessage("You are not on Extreme Mode!");
		}
	}
</code>[/quote]</p>
<p>might try to do this but it would require me changing sooo much stuff that id rather not have to do that…does anybody know how to do it without changing it like this?</p>
<p>i also tried this and it didnt work…but this compiled.</p>
<p><code>                if(playerCommand.startsWith("extreme")) {
 		c.extremeMode = true;
                c.getItems().addItem(3757, 1);
		} else {
	c.sendMessage("you need to be extreme to have one of those!");
		return;
}</code></p>
<p>and by compiles i mean it accepts it but the thing is when i try the command even with regular players it works…they dont need to be extreme -.-</p>
