    <title>Need lots of help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-lots-of-help/285925</link>
    <description>Okay, I am pretty new to the whole idea of programming an private sever, and I have some questions. First off, what is the best client and source for me to start off with? I have searched in the download section but I cannot seem to find one with a good client and source. Next, I have already done portforwarding, created a no-ip, do I just change the Ip in client.java and GUI.java to my no-ip address? I have done that before but people still cannot connect to my server. 
Thanks in advance.</description>

<p>Look at the above topic posted from someone. Ok now, just from the title of that topic you can tell that he is a immature wanna-be java coder who doesn’t know the meaning of the word grammer. This topic however is completely opposite from that which makes it amazing. Just had to throw that out there.</p>

<p>I almost just shit my pants… Not gonna lie this is the first time I have seen someone asking for help in the help section use proper grammer and english… You just made my entire day, so for that I thank you. Anyway people already answered your nooby question but I would recommend the source of KevenScape. Search for it in the download section. Hope I helped =)</p>

<p>Server source:</p>
<p>Get a clean source, which doesn’t have too many bugs, and has all the basics you need/want.<br>
You can see in the download section for server sources etc, what the best one would be.</p>
<p>I can’t reccomend you one cause i don’t know what kind of server you’re wanting to make…</p>

              <p>lul, Client is a ‘file pack’ which allows you to connect to a server and play there. Source, however, is an base of the client, which you can modify, edit, code, (do WHATEVER) and you can create your own server once modified the source. Remember! give the credits who deservers them(if you just take the source, modify 1 item and release it as your own ppl start blaming you about leeching)</p>

<p>Most people go for the flashy sources. But get a nice, organized, and clean source. That way, it will be easy go code, and easy to edit. Personally, I would recommend Sk1ttlezrule43v. His final edition comes with a 317, 508, and 525 source. Depends on which deob your going after. Alot of people like All-Star scape source. And others like other sources. Clients are another thing. It really doesn’t matter which client you go after. But different deob source types cause for different clients.  Here is the source.</p>

<p>It really doesn’t matter, just choose what you like best.   ^.-</p>
