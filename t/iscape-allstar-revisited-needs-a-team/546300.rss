    <title>iScape - Allstar Revisited! Needs a team!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/iscape-allstar-revisited-needs-a-team/546300</link>
    <description>iScape is going to be the most innovative Allstar-based server out there. In terms of content we are rapidly catching up to the pace-setters such as CreativeScape and Allstar-Legends.

Recent updates include but not limited to:

[ul][li]Complete drops rework now using a .cfg file to reference npc, item, amount (can use values in the cfg for random numbers [e.g. 600-800]), and chance of drop[/li]
[li]Weapon speeds (longbow slower than shortbow faster than 2h, etc.)[/li]
[li]Level, Range Bonus, Bow Type, and Arrow Type now are all factors in Ranged damage[/li]
[li]Cleaned grammar[/li]
[li]Fixed teleports[/li]
[li]Back end clutter reductions[/li]
[li]Proper anti 2h+shield, bow+shield[/li][/ul]

.........................................................
Things to come very soon (if not already done, I probably won&#39;t update this every time I add something)
-Bandos, Armadyl, Zamorak, and Saradomin GWD bosses, with special attacks and minions
-Quest Tab reworks with openable Tabbing inside of it.
-All skilling reworks (mining, thieving, fishing, cooking, firemaking, woodcutting, etc)
-Prayer fixes (everyone knows prayer doesn&#39;t work in Allstars, well not for long)
-Working Clan Chat
-Webclient under our own domain.
-IPBoards Forums
-No more &quot;Train&quot; teleport....Monsters will be in locations walkable to, and each one will have individually catered drop logics.
-&quot;Juggernaut&quot; Minigame
-&quot;Tag&quot; Minigame
-Castlewars Minigame
-Elite Soldier boss
-Barrellchest boss
-Corrected Chaos Elementals
-Members&#39; benefits
-Donator Zone
-Donator items
-New crowns for Server Support, Donators, Bug splatters
-(Distant Future) Hunger Games Minigame

[li]Bug Splatter #2[/li]
