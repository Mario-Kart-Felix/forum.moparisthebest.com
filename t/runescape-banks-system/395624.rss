    <title>Runescape Banks System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-banks-system/395624</link>
    <description>The Runescape Banking system can do a lot more than just hold your items. However, because you are only allowed 28 slots for items, the bank offers some extra space for your items. This can come in handy if you want to keep some items which equals a lot of Rs money. If you die, you will only be able to keep three of your best items on you at the time, unless you have the prayer that allows you to keep one extra item. Even if you do keep one extra, that&#39;s still only 4 out of 28. When you bank your items, you protect them from being lost. ;D
