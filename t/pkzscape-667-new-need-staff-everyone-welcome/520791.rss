We strive for the best game environment for everyone - we care about our players&#39; opinions and we take their suggestions into account. Due to our extensive attention to our players PkzScape has been able to become the top ranking Runescape Private Server*. The players are the foundation to our success, without players we would be only a fraction of our current size. The players are our friends, we commit to have a clear and effective communication with them.. Due to the large amount of support our players give us we have fully fixed our wilderness and also we have given the players a great platform for clans to develop and to improve clan community. At the same time it motivates individual clans to become more active. We are thinking of improvements to the game at all times. That is what makes us the #1 Runescape Private Server* - We pursue to remain ahead of our competition at all times.[/center]



[center]PkzScape fits YOU.[/center]





[center]PkzScape was designed to entertain every type of player. We have different game modes where you can choose how you would like to play. Are you an old-school lover? This is your lucky day!
