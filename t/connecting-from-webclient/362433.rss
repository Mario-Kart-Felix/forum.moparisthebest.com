    <title>Connecting from Webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connecting-from-webclient/362433</link>
    <description>Hi guys. So I was making a webclient on rs-ps after failing ric&#39;s tutorial, and the rs-ps works all great but theres one problem.
I login, I get happy that I&#39;m getting in the game, and I disconnect. But when I go from the client, it lets me come in, no problem. I really need the webclient to work, is there anything wrong with it? Because it&#39;s destroying my server&#39;s population that people have to download something to play on. I&#39;ll rep someone if they help me fix this problem.

All help is appreciated, thanks :)</description>
