              <p>Ok, so if you are using a 317 source what I am guessing. Then open your source folder up and search for client.java (it should look like notepad) Once you open that up hold in (Ctrl F) For a shortcut to find a word. Search for owner and coder now if it looks like this.<code>if (playerRights == 3)
{
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = "Owner and Coder " +playerName+ " has logged in";
}</code></p>
<p>then that means you allready have it and all you need to do is go back to your source open up the characters folder and double click your user name.txt and Ctrl + F again and this time search for rights once you search for that delete the 0 and make it 3.<br>
3 = owner-coowner<br>
2 = hidin admin (i think)<br>
1 = mod<br>
0 = normal player</p>
<p>Ok, now if you didnt have that coding there for the player rights in client.java then go back to that and search NewHP = playerLevel<br>
once you are there hit enter twice (make sure that your blinking curser is at the end of the word) then put this code in.<code>if (playerRights == 3)
{
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = "Owner and Coder " +playerName+ " has logged in";
}
else if (playerRights == 3)
{
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = "Owner and Coder " +playerName+ " has logged out";
}</code><br>
And if you want all the rights like adminstrator had logged in mod logged in so on then put this code in.[code]if (playerRights == 3)<br>
{<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Owner and Coder " +playerName+ " has logged in”;<br>
}<br>
else if (playerRights == 2)<br>
{<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Administrtor " +playerName+ " has logged in”;<br>
}</p>
<p>else if (playerRights == 1)<br>
{<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Moderator " +playerName+ " has logged in”;<br>
}<br>
else if (playerRights == 0)<br>
{<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Player " +playerName+ " has logged in”;<br>
}<br>
}<br>
else if (playerRights == 3)<br>
{<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Owner and Coder " +playerName+ " has logged out”;<br>
}<br>
if (playerRights == 2)<br>
{<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Administrtor " +playerName+ " has logged out”;<br>
}<br>
if (playerRights == 1)<br>
{<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Moderator " +playerName+ " has logged out”;<br>
}<br>
if (playerRights == 0)<br>
{<br>
PlayerHandler.messageToAll = “Player " +playerName+ " has logged out”;<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>I Hope This Has Worked If Not Then I Dont No Whats Wrong Might Need To Get A New Source.<br>
I Could Give You My Client.java But Dont No If It Will Work For Your Source.</p>
