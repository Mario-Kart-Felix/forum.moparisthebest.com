    <title>Making summoning?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-summoning/283206</link>
    <description>How do I make/add summoning to my server, I saw one server that had summoning on it, You know where the harp icon is? to the right of the player controls icon? The guy put the monsters to summon in there and it was based on your level and how long you played, now obviously cuz of my noobish skillz I couldn&#39;t do that even if I tried but I wanted to know if I could get help on doing this.</description>
