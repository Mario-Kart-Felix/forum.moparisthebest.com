    <description>Ok, it seems whenever a user has say, phead=-100, which is also in the hide command, it dc&#39;s everyone around, because their name gets changed to: vyflkeeyfi08, level gets bugged, etc. and when the person moves, everyone in area get&#39;s dcd. So I removed the command from server, but today a user came on, with some kind of client, which somehow, set him as that status, phead-100(all body parts), his level was -629, and name vyflkeeyfi08. He was demanding stuff and whatnot, I ip banned, but I would like to know how to fix. Make it so it won&#39;t dc users when he moves.</description>
