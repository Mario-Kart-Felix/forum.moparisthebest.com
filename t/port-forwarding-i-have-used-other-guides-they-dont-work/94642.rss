    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-i-have-used-other-guides-they-dont-work/94642</link>
    <description>Hi, i always wanted to run my own server, then the obvious happened i got a new &#39;wire-less&#39; router.
I have lots of experience in java coding and have many of my own servers that friends run, when i got the new router at first i tried to fix it but then it just never worked now i have pt my head down and i am going to get this problem fixed.
Ok, the router i have is a &#39;Bt Home Hub&#39; , what i do is, go into the router control panel, then i go to application and game sharing, then i add a new exception, the exception is this: 
Protocol	Port Range	Translate To ...	Trigger Protocol	Trigger Port	



Any	       43594 - 43595	43594 - 43595	               -	                 -  

I have tried several times and it always fails to work, i will do anything to get this working, please email me at admin@weedscape.co.uk or reply to me on here. Help would be appreciated many thanks, Alex.</description>
