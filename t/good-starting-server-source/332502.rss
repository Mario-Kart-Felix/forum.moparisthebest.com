    <title>Good starting server source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-starting-server-source/332502</link>
    <description>Hello, I have created many servers in the past
Pvpangel, Silent pkz. Both were very popular but very noobish. Pvpangel was a pickup server with much lag. Silent pkz was good for a while but then dupers came and ruined economy. What source should i use to start a stable server that will not be easily hacked.
Thank you,
and for people that leave comments like google first, many of the answers were different then each other and I would like to hear some of the same comments so I know which source was most verifiable.</description>
