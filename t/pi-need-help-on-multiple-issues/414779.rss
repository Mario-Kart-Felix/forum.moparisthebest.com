    <description>I don&#39;t feel like creating 30 new topics every time I need help with an individual issue, so I&#39;m just going to list all the issues I need help with in this topic. 

If you feel like helping please check back on this often as I will continue to edit it with my new problems. 
If not, please just don&#39;t even post :)

Problem 1: I&#39;m trying to get items to permanently spawn in different spots in the world, and I can&#39;t quite figure out how to do that. Thanks to imsuperman05, I now know the code but am stumped as to where to place it. If anyone knows where to put this please do tell!
[quote=&quot;imsuperman05, post:10, topic:414766&quot;][code=java]Server.itemHandler.createGroundItem(c, itemId, itemX, itemY, itemAmount, y);[/code][/quote]

Problem 2: I figured out how to remove objects, but when I remove a tall object, like a tree, the top of the trunk and the leaves  still appear. It&#39;s like the object is on height 0 and height 1 and I can only remove height 0. 

Problem 3: Dragon arrows (P++) weild in the weapon slot. 
I know, I know.. item.java, add item # under arrows, I did that; but for some reason it&#39;s still going in weapon slot. Any ideas?

Problem 4: coming soon -_-</description>
