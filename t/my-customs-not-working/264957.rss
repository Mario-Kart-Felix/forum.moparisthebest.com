    <title>My customs not working</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-customs-not-working/264957</link>
    <description>Okay, well, this may sound noobish, but I really don&#39;t use models. This got interesting however. So, I made a client based on OldkoScape. Now, I&#39;m using an Allstar-Scape base server. So, Oldkoscape Client, Allstar server. I want to use the oldkoscape models with my server. but when I go to wield something like an Admin Platebosy, it comes out wielded as a weapon and it looks corrupted. I can use the OldkoScape client with the Oldkoscape server. I head somethings about using the item2.java or something along the lines of that to make the custom items work. If someone can tell me more on what to do, I&#39;ll greatly appreciate it. :P</description>
