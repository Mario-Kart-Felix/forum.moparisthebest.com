    <description>Greetings :D, not sure if anyone here cares about the psychology of the internet as a whole but this is interesting.

http://www.worldofends.com/

    &lt;blockquote&gt;When Craig Burton describes the Net&#39;s stupid architecture as a hollow sphere comprised entirely of ends3, he&#39;s painting a picture that gets at what&#39;s most remarkable about the Internet&#39;s architecture: Take the value out of the center and you enable an insane flowering of value among the connected end points. Because, of course, when every end is connected, each to each and each to all, the ends aren&#39;t endpoints at all.

    And what do we ends do? Anything that can be done by anyone who wants to move bits around.

    Notice the pride in our voice when we say &quot;anything&quot; and &quot;anyone&quot;? That comes directly from the Internet&#39;s simple, stupid technical architecture.

    Because the Internet is an agreement, it doesn&#39;t belong to any one person or group. Not the incumbent companies that provide the backbone. Not the ISPs that provide our connections. Not the hosting companies that rent us servers. Not the industry associations that believe their existence is threatened by what the rest of us do on the Net. Not any government, no matter how sincerely it believes that it&#39;s just trying to keep its people secure and complacent.

    To connect to the Internet is to agree to grow value on its edges. And then something really interesting happens. We are all connected equally. Distance doesn&#39;t matter. The obstacles fall away and for the first time the human need to connect can be realized without artificial barriers.

    The Internet gives us the means to become a world of ends for the first time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<pre><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;When Craig Burton describes the Net's stupid architecture as a hollow sphere comprised entirely of ends3, he's painting a picture that gets at what's most remarkable about the Internet's architecture: Take the value out of the center and you enable an insane flowering of value among the connected end points. Because, of course, when every end is connected, each to each and each to all, the ends aren't endpoints at all.
