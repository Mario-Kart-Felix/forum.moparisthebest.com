    <title>[317][Delta] Help?</title>

    <description>Hi guys
Im really frustrated because I cannot figure out how to make it so that you cannot perform the action you click on until you are STANDING next to it?  
Example, doors open no matter how far I am away, they just open.
Example, I can pick flax/spin it to bowstrings without standing next to it
Example, If I click &quot;use quickly - Bank booth&quot; my bank opens, even if I am several spaces away.

can anyone tell me how to fix this?  Im completely lost and dont know where to really dive in.  I know we arent supposed to spoonfeed here but if theres a tut you can point me to itd be much appreciated.</description>
