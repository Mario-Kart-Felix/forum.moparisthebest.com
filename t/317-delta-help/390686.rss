    <title>[317] Delta Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-delta-help/390686</link>
    <description>Okay well I am owner of Swebbyscape.
I wanted to add a custom minigame. 
I wanted to make something that is like the godwars, where u have to kill 15 saradomin wizards in order to go down to the boss.
I tried doing this, and i crashed and it erased every account that logged in ftw....
Now i&#39;m just wondering how to do it.
I want to add
character-JKills = 0  to char files,
Also i want to make it so when u kill NPC 1455 (monkey guard) it gives u +1 &quot;Jkill&quot;

Any Help in making this, or a link to a tut would be great, if you want to do yourself, visit my chat box which is at

              <p>Well, i would but i had to delete right away cause 5 players had already lost their accounts, i had to go to like a week ago backup. So i do not have the pictures but what i did is i took everything that said “saraKills” and right below it copied and paste and changed to Jkills.</p>
