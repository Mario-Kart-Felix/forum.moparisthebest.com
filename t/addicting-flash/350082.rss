    <description>Found this game on flash
http://www.flash-spel.se/game/2338/Airline.html

So basically you start off with some money (enough to buy a new beechcraft 1900 I think)
and you set routes, and make profits. Very addicting, I&#39;m on level 20. (Make a mochi account so it&#39;ll save your planes and money)


Level 2 gives you about $90,000 iirc. Then every other level gives you $10,000 on top of the $90,000. (Level 3 = $100,000). Normally every level until level 10 you unlock a plane. Then you start unlocking planes every 2-4 levels or so.

What you should do in the first 10-15 levels is buy 5-8 beechcraft 1900&#39;s (buy them used with less hours and cycles) and focus on getting points (to level you). Then you sell all your beechcrafts upgrade to airbus&#39;s. Thats when you start focusing on making profits with your larger jets and also gaining points to level you. Normaly if you get 85% satisfaction on your flight you get about 5 points. On larger jets you can get 6-7 and then even 10-20.

Very fucking addicting.
Only down side is once you start getting to the higher levels it can take forever to get your points. 
Also for a flight from Los Angelos to Detroit for example, you need to wait 6 minutes.
Shorter flights are like 1-3 minutes.

Currently I operate 
[s]4 a318&#39;s and 3 beechcraft 1900&#39;s (for getting points).
I&#39;ve also got just over $1,000,000 cash

Very recentley upgraded my fleet to 4 new 737-800&#39;s and a new a318.</description>
