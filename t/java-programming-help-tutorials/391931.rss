    <description>Ok hay guys, as you can see from the title i need a little help finding a good website to help teach me basic java language, im not gunna lie i suck at java coding. i managed to make a few commands in my rsps and added a few items but i don&#39;t think that that is like going to help me in any way, so if you know of a website that can help teach me java i would appriciate it very much. i have tryed finding one, no luck though, im looking for a site that can teach you java there and then, i came across it once, it asks you to make a code, compile it then it tells you what errors there are and makes you fix it. if this sounds similer to anything you know of please give me a link.

Kind regards
