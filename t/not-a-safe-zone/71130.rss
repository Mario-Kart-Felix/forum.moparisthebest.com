    <title>Not a safe zone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/not-a-safe-zone/71130</link>
    <description>well im having a problem here. i want to make the place ::pkbox just like in fr33sc4pe, but im not using that source. i already have the coords and everything. but in this server you can only pk in the wildy not anywhere else, so i decided to make pkbox so they can fight there too, as a popular fighting zone. i get the coords of what i want and i want to make it an attackable zone.

the coords are the following :

[code]if (absY &gt;=2764 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=2772 &amp;&amp; absX &gt;=2759 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;=2761) 
if (absY &gt;=2764 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=2766 &amp;&amp; absX &gt;=2762 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;=2767) 
if (absY &gt;=2764 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=2772 &amp;&amp; absX &gt;=2768 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;=2770)[/code]
all in one line of course.

i can&#39;t add it in public boolean NonWildy because its for safe zones. so do i have to edit the coords that are already there so it cannot include the coords above ^^. and where do i add them?[br][size=1]Posted on: March 25, 2007, 03:01:17 PM[/size][hr]Nvm, i just copied the public boolean from fr33sc4p3 sry fr33 lol. well thanks for all ur help -.-.......</description>
