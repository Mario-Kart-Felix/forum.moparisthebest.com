Critics of the government raid which snatched Elian Gonzalez from his or her Miami relatives’ Little Havana home two weeks ago point out, among other things, that a great deal more force was used as compared to necessary. Immigration authorities say they had justification to use force. While CBS News Surgeon Jeffrey Kofman reports, one of those reasons was an organization known as Alpha 66. The actual groups’ 80-year-old general secretary, Andres Nazario Sargen, contends Alpha 66 associates would never fire guns at U.Ersus. agents. “No,” according to him, “All the bullets tend to be for Fidel Castro.” They may be anti-Communist commandos dedicated to the armed overthrow of Castro. While they happen to be linked to past problems in Cuba, now they might be best known for weekend soccer drills for kids in the Everglades. “No, I don’t believe America has to be scared of them and don’t think even Fidel Castro has to be afraid of them,” says Professor Jaime Suchlicki of the College of Miami. Though the INS sees that differently. Their intelligence reported five Leader members around the Gonzales residence. In fact, says 1 INS agent, "Three of those five were individuals who had, several years ago, engaged in an extra-territorial attack over a tourist hotel in Cuba."Alpha insists those individuals have been unarmed. These days, the most radical thing about Leader is its rhetoric. It makes daily problems on Cuba with shortwave broadcasts. The walls associated with Alpha’s Little Havana headquarters are usually lined with images of the glory days and nights, when operatives triedtogether with little successto challenge the Cuban economy. However all that is now any fading memory.“It’s a new remnant of the past,” claims Professor Suchlicki. “Right now they are still over, they’re old, they don’t have the power that they had.” But also for the old warriors, the stood still. Since they still dream of liberating Cuba, they insist they will never bring his or her war to their adopted homeland.  <a href="http://beatsbydrdre2281.labeautesalonandspa.com/2013/05/29/beats-by-dre-noise-cancelling-switch/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">beats by dre noise cancelling switch</a><br>
