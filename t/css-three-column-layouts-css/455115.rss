    <title>[CSS] Three column layouts[CSS]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/css-three-column-layouts-css/455115</link>
    <description>Hello, MoparScape.

I believe it&#39;s about time that I released another tutorial, this one being useful to those who wish to create their own websites. This will cover creating a three column based layout using the CSS language. If you don&#39;t know any CSS, check out my other tutorial [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,555823.0.html]here.[/url] This will take you through the basics of CSS and then you can take a look at this tutorial in creating a layout on the page.

Without further ado, I give you the CSS Three Column Layout tutorial:

[b]CSS Floats and the 3 column layout[/b]
Using the float property of CSS manipulates your browser to position text or images or anything else for that matter of fact to either the left or right of your browser. This will give you a more &quot;newspaper&quot; columns look, it looks nice in some instances. Here&#39;s the CSS:
[code=css]
.floatcol_left {
float: left;
margin-right: 15px;
width: 250px;
}
[/code]
This tells your browser that when .floatcol_left is called to align the paragraph, or image or whatever to the left with a margin of 15 pixels on the right and it&#39;s 250 pixels wide.

Here&#39;s the HTML code you need to call .floatcol_left:
[code=html]
&lt;div class=&quot;floatcol_left&quot;&gt;
Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him.
&lt;/div&gt;
[/code]

As you will see, if you return the above in a browser it&#39;ll have aligned your column to the left of the screen displaying that dummy text I gave you. You could also align it to the right doing the following:
[code=css]
.floatcol_right {
float: right;
margin-left: 15px;
width: 250px;
}
[/code]

You just return this using the same HTML I gave you above, with some slight changes of course, your code should now look like this:
[code=html]
&lt;div class=&quot;floatcol_right&quot;&gt;
Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him.
&lt;/div&gt;
[/code]
This will now align your text to the right of the screen, you can now combine these which I&#39;ll show you below:

[code=css]
.floatcol_left {
float: left;
margin-right: 15px;
width: 250px;
}
.floatcol_right {
float: right;
margin-left: 15px;
width: 250px;
}
[/code]
Then returning it with the HTML of:
[code=html]
&lt;div class=&quot;floatcol_left&quot;&gt;
Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;floatcol_right&quot;&gt;
Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him. Dummy text to align to the left of the screen following Ruby&#39;s 6th MoparScape website development and design tutorial, if I need help I&#39;ll definitely ask him.
&lt;/div&gt;
[/code]

After doing this, it&#39;ll show you a column on the left and a column on the right, you now have a 3 column layout site going on, put whatever you want in the left and right columns, I would include latest updates in one of them and maybe a navigation bar in the other or even a sitemap, it&#39;s your choice!

I hope you find this tutorial useful while creating 3 column layouts!

Best regards,
Ruby.</description>

<p>Seems like an elegant design; however, for a RSPS I don’t think this is the best solution. The above game nav bar is the best solution. Simple, easy tutorial nonetheless.</p>

<p>Simple sites are often better than others. An above content navbar isn’t always needed, some people like to have a change, so why not have a left aligning navigation area?</p>
<p>This may be simple, however I get pmed daily about stuff such as this.</p>
