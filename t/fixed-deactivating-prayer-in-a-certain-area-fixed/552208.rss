    <title>[fixed] deactivating prayer in a certain area [fixed]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixed-deactivating-prayer-in-a-certain-area-fixed/552208</link>
    <description>hey guys i am using pi and i could not find the code i needed by google or searching runeserver/ mopar.

i made a custom mini game that is based inside castle wars with point system &amp; reward shop, ect. and i want to make it so that when you are in the minigame you cant use any prayers (mainly protect mage, range, and meele).

i started trying to figure out how to write the code myself and this is all i could come up with sofar:
[code]if(absX &gt; Blank &amp;&amp; absX &lt; Blank &amp;&amp; absY &gt; Blank &amp;&amp; absY &lt; BLANK
c.ActivePrayers().contains((Prayer.Protect from Meele) == false);
c.ActivePrayers().contains((Prayer.Protect from Missiles) == false);
c.ActivePrayers().contains((Prayer.Protect from Magic) == false);
c.sendMessage(&quot;@red@You can NOT use protection prayers in here! &quot;)
[/code]
stole the idea for that code from how i once coded the location for a pk box on a old project i was once doing.

i want it so that if you click no any of them 3 prayers in the minigame (in castle wars) it turns if back off and sends message saying you cant use it in here.

IK that my code most likely wouldnt work, like i said i was just attempting to get an idea of how it could work but i never figured it out which is why im looking for help.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: sorry guys! i dont need help anymore i figured it out on myown.
if anyone need to know how to do something similar and runs across this topic this is how i figured it out.
-went ingame and clicked on prayers and got button ids from server panel.
-searched those id numbers in server files and ended up in clickingbuttons.java
-searched those ids in clicking buttons and came across these codes:
[code]		case 21246: // protect from range
			c.getCombat().activatePrayer(17);
			break;
		case 21247: // protect from melee
			c.getCombat().activatePrayer(18);
			break;
		case 70088: // 44 range
			c.getCombat().activatePrayer(19);
			break;[/code]

-i started editing the code and this is what i ended up with:
[code]		case 21245: // protect from magic
		if(c.absX &gt; 2365 &amp;&amp; c.absX &lt; 2435 &amp;&amp; c.absY &gt; 3070 &amp;&amp; c.absY &lt; 3140) {
			c.sendMessage(&quot;@red@You can NOT use protect magic in here!&quot;);
		return;
		} else {
			c.getCombat().activatePrayer(16);
		}
			break;[/code]

**It works perfectly fine.
so thanks anyone who came to the post trying to help 
and
for anyone that finds this post by googling the same issue well i hope this works for you too. (:</description>
