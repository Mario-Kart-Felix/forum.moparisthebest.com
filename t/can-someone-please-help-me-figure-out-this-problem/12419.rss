    <description>I was trying to add projectiles using this tut 

http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,4617.0.html

I went through it and then compiled and got lots of errors. I&#39;ve decided to undo everything i did so i started 

to delete what i have added. I&#39;ve done as much as i can but when i compiled, i got this error and just then couldnt fix it. Maybe someone can explain to me how?

[code]client.java:26483: &#39;try&#39; without &#39;catch&#39; or &#39;finally&#39;
try {
^
1 error
