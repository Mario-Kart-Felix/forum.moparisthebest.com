    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-online-issue/313880</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to connect my client online with the moparscape server status list.
I cannot seem to be able to get it online at all and its not working for me.
Someone please post helpful advice and if also a explanation on how to do so.
