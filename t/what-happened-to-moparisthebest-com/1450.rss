    <title>What Happened to moparisthebest.com?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-happened-to-moparisthebest-com/1450</link>
    <description>Well its a really long story, so I will give the short version of it, I got home thursday night to find the forums very slow, and within 5 minutes I got the lovely page telling me to contact my host.

Turns out the cause of this was some people in the irc got together and decided to ddos/exploit impsoft.net, and Mr. X ddosed moparisthebest.com to try and get them to stop, that along with impsoft.net redirecting the attacks on it to here got my host to shut me down.

I emailed my host and even called them on thursday night, they told me it appeared the server was down (even though it obviosly wasn&#39;t) and it would be only 24 hours before I would have access again, the next day (friday) after I got back from work I called them again because it still wasnt up, this time they said my account had been suspended because I was contacting the mysql server too much, and I either needed to delete the /smf/ directory, or fix the php scripts in the /smf/ directory, or buy better hosting to get my site back. I told them I would delete the directory temporarily while I fixed the php scripts, so they gave me the site back. (no way I could afford better hosting because I am barely paying the rent as is)

So now I modified some stuff so hopefully this will never happen again. If I do end up having to buy better hosting because of this I will need donations or to start charging for moparscape to do this, because I cant afford it right now. (college, rent utilities, yall know the deal, if any of you would like to donate my paypal is moparisthebest@hotmail.com but there is no need to do so right now)

Lastly both ruler (owner of impsoft.net) and Mr. X have approached me and apoligized for redirecting attacks here and attacking me respectivly, thier apology has been accepted and I want no more attacks on them or any other sites, period.

Anyway Im glad its back up as Im sure most of you are, have fun ;) :D</description>

              <p>My side of the story:</p>

<p>This probably wouldn't have happened if I didn't go in the irc and start talking about impsoft.</p>

<p>When GenoDemon threatened to ddos this site because if Gimpsoft, I got pissed. Even though it's none of my business I decided to complain about it.</p>

<p>So, later I went into the irc and I started telling them about what geno said, and how he was gonna ddos these forums. I guess that made some other's pretty pissed, so Stork decided to exploit impsoft.net</p>

<p>He made a little program, not sure exactly what it did but when ran it would send search requests on the impsoft server. I wasn't able to run the program for some reason, and other didn't use it. But Stork took down impsoft within a matter of seconds, and their host suspended them for using more then 20% of the cpu. Stork stopped the attack within a few minutes and impsoft.net was back up within 10 minutes, all they did was disable the abilty to search the forums as a guest. </p>

<p>From there on we had no part in the attack, but I think a few other's may have been ddosing impsoft. So, ruler re-directed the attacks here, and Mr. X joined in and attacked. Now what I don't get is why GenoDemon is still denying that they re-directed the attacks, but all I know is that it probably wouldn't have happened if I didn't tell anyone about what geno said. I feel guilty about it, but there's not much I can do about it, other then give my support.</p>

<p>Mopar, if you need donations then I will <em>try</em> to slide you like 20-30 dollars, but my money is extremely limited. I already owe someone a few hundred dollars, so I've been saving up. </p>

<p>Btw, sdcit, it's distributed denial of service attack. Not delievered <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=3" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>Basically it's a lot of computers(or servers) attacking a site or IP. Could be done through pinging but there are many ways.</p>

              <p>Well its a really long story, so I will give the short version of it, I got home thursday night to find the forums very slow, and within 5 minutes I got the lovely page telling me to contact my host.</p>

<p>Turns out the cause of this was some people in the irc got together and decided to ddos/exploit impsoft.net, and Mr. X ddosed moparisthebest.com to try and get them to stop, that along with impsoft.net redirecting the attacks on it to here got my host to shut me down.</p>

<p>I emailed my host and even called them on thursday night, they told me it appeared the server was down (even though it obviosly wasn't) and it would be only 24 hours before I would have access again, the next day (friday) after I got back from work I called them again because it still wasnt up, this time they said my account had been suspended because I was contacting the mysql server too much, and I either needed to delete the /smf/ directory, or fix the php scripts in the /smf/ directory, or buy better hosting to get my site back. I told them I would delete the directory temporarily while I fixed the php scripts, so they gave me the site back. (no way I could afford better hosting because I am barely paying the rent as is)</p>

<p>So now I modified some stuff so hopefully this will never happen again. If I do end up having to buy better hosting because of this I will need donations or to start charging for moparscape to do this, because I cant afford it right now. (college, rent utilities, yall know the deal, if any of you would like to donate my paypal is moparisthebest@hotmail.com but there is no need to do so right now)</p>

<p>Lastly both ruler (owner of impsoft.net) and Mr. X have approached me and apoligized for redirecting attacks here and attacking me respectivly, thier apology has been accepted and I want no more attacks on them or any other sites, period.</p>

<p>Anyway Im glad its back up as Im sure most of you are, have fun <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/wink.png?v=3" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
