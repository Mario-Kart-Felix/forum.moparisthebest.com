    <title>Looking for someone to host for</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-someone-to-host-for/338428</link>
    <description>I have been looking around the forum and i couldn&#39;t find out where i should post this. So i will post this here.

I wan&#39;t to host a runescape private server. I know how to port forward, you only have to tell me the ports to forward.

I got 3,00 GHz and 6,00 GB Ram. I also got a 25mbit\s internet. Contact me on &quot;Fail-o@hotmail.com&quot; for more information. And i can host 24/7.

Or just reply here with you&#39;r MSN and i will add you.</description>

If you want to host for someone else put a server help and advertise this on the <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php" data-bbcode="true">server status</a>.<br>
Thank you.</p>
