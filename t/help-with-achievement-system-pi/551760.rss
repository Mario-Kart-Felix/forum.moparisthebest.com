    <description>Okay guys, it&#39;s me again, and I have written an achievement system. Yes I know it is poorly written, but I am learning. Considering that this is all a learning process, I need some help as to know why the proper items aren&#39;t being given upon finishing the achievement. Here is my code. 

[code]package server.model.players;

public class AchievementManager {

	/*	Author:
	 * --------- BEALE ----------
	 * :)
	 */	
	
	int wcPoints;
	int achievementPoint;
	int fishCaught;
	int playerKills;
	public int pkType = 0;
	public int achievementType = 0;
	public int wcType = 0;
	
	public void fishAchievement(int achievementType) {
	
		switch (achievementType) {
		
		case 1:
		if(fishCaught == 1000) {
				achievementPoint += 10;
			sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Easy Achievement: Catch 1,000 fish&quot;);
			sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. You have received 10 achievement points.&quot;);
		break;	
		}

		case 2:
			if(fishCaught == 5000) {
				achievementPoint += 15;
			sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Medium Achievement: Catch 5,000 fish&quot;);
			sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. You have received 15 achievement points.&quot;);
	break;
			}

		case 3:
			if(fishCaught == 10000) {
				achievementPoint += 20;
			sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Hard Achievement: Catch 10,000 fish&quot;);
			sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. You have received 20 achievement points.&quot;);
		break;
			}
		}
	}
	
	int npcsKilled = 0;
	public int killType = 0;
	
	public void npcsKilled(int killType) {
		switch (killType){
		case 1:
			if(npcsKilled == 250) {
				achievementPoint += 10;
				sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Easy Achievement: Kill 250 NPCS&quot;);
				sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
	}
		break;
		
		case 2:
			if(npcsKilled == 500) {
				achievementPoint += 10;
				sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Easy Achievement: Kill 500 NPCS&quot;);
				sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
	}
		break;

		case 3:
			if(npcsKilled == 1000) {
				achievementPoint += 20;
				sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Hard Achievement: Kill 1,000 NPCS&quot;);
				sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
	}
		break;
		}
	}

		public void playerKillAchievement(int pkType) {
			switch (pkType){
			case 1:
				if(playerKills == 250) {
					achievementPoint += 10;
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Easy Achievement: Obtain 250 player Kills&quot;);
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
		}
			break;
			
			case 2:
				if(playerKills == 500) {
					achievementPoint += 15;
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Medium Achievement: Obtain 500 player kills&quot;);
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
		}
			break;

			case 3:
				if(playerKills == 1000) {
					achievementPoint += 20;
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Hard Achievement: Obtain 1,000 player kills&quot;);
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
		}
			break;
		}
		}
		
		public void wcAchievement(int wcType) {
			switch (wcType){
			case 1:
				if(wcPoints == 1000) {
					achievementPoint += 10;
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Easy Achievement: Chop 1,000 logs&quot;);
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
		}
			break;
			
			case 2:
				if(wcPoints == 5000) {
					achievementPoint += 15;
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Medium Achievement: Chop 5,000 logs&quot;);
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
		}
			break;

			case 3:
				if(wcPoints == 10000) {
					achievementPoint += 20;
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;You have completed the Hard Achievement: Chop 10,000 logs&quot;);
					sendMessage(&quot;&lt;shad=1231231&gt;Congratulations. Spend your points wisely.&quot;);
		}
			break;
		}
		}
		
	
	private void sendMessage(String string) {
		
	}
}
[/code]

I have all of the ints declared in player.java and some in achievementManager.java.. For one example, an achievement is to fish 1,000 fish for 10 achievement points. I set it to where every fish that you collect, you get one &quot;fishCaught&quot; point. within the code, it says &quot; if(fishCaught == 1000) { &quot; ect ect, and it is supposed to give out 10 achievement points once you hit 1000 fishCaught points. Unforunately, it doesn&#39;t give you the reward. I have no errors anywhere in any compiler or anything, but I have considered maybe I am using the switch statements in an improper manner? Any suggestions on how to fix guys?</description>

Declare the variables in the client or player class. Access them in the AchievementManager class with public getters and setters.<br>
You’ll probably have to modify the method(s) to use a Client object instead of just the achievementType[/quote]</p>
<p>okay thanks lets see how this works</p>
