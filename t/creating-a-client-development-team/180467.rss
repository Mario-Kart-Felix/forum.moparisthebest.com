    <description>[center][size=32pt]OLA PEOPLE[/size][/center]

[center][b]I am trying to develop a webclient for my server, Crank That Scape![/b][/center]
[center][b]Well I have never made a client and I am hiring people for a development team to create it! If you are good at making a client or have helped make one before, please sign up! If you help, you could earn yourself a mod or admin spot on my server. This is a creation that must be done right![/b][/center]



Client Makers
1. 0bby (server player)
2. ????



[center]I am a pretty good server coder, but clients are a whole other story for me. Help needed![/center]</description>
