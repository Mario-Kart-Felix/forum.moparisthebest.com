    <description>Hey, I&#39;m having an issue with my server.  When players switch items, or sometimes when they just do something like clicking a steel titan, they will get disconnected.  These aren&#39;t just normal disconnections, though.  Sometimes the players will get [url=http://i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr9/ownerthugz/weirdclawdc.png]Random PMs/Server Update Message[/url], sometimes [url=http://i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr9/ownerthugz/wtfdc.png]all other players disappear/odd clan chat message[/url], and sometimes random interfaces will open up like [url=http://i46.tinypic.com/ebajgw.png]thessilas clothes shop[/url].  Other times, the client will just freeze.  The picture could[url=http://i.imgur.com/Ms6tv.jpg] just zoom out[/url], and there are many other instances as well.

Do any of you know what could be causing this?  Is it client sided?</description>
