    <title>Runescape Updated Their Engine, Again!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-updated-their-engine-again/116814</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;www.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=850&quot;]his week we&#39;ve made another internal upgrade to the RuneScape game engine, which makes it possible for us to do more complex/varied updates in the future.

This time around the interface system has had another overhaul, with a large chunk of the system completely replaced with a more powerful version. We&#39;ve then had to adjust and retest all the old interfaces to make sure they still work under the new system (a big job!).

One immediate improvement you&#39;ll notice with this update is some new &#39;hot keys&#39; - much like the &#39;control&#39; key can be used to run. Now, you can use F1 - F12 to open up most of your interfaces, and the &#39;escape&#39; key will open your inventory. Once you get used to these, we&#39;re sure you&#39;ll find that it makes doing things much, much quicker.

The keys work like this:

Esc - Inventory
F1 - Combat options
F2 - Your statistics
F3 - Quest Journal
F4 - Equipped interface
F5 - Prayer
F6 - Spellbook
F8 - Friends list
F9 - Ignore list
F10 - Options interface
F11 - Emotes
F12 - Music Player
Control - Run

Most of the other changes that have been made aren&#39;t generally things that you&#39;ll notice immediately, but there&#39;s a surprisingly large amount of work involved in any engine upgrade. Admittedly, it&#39;s not the most exciting update in the short term, but it&#39;s definitely worth it in the long run!

All this frantic behind the scenes activity finally means we can now get started on some (much requested) updates to some of our main interfaces - updates which weren&#39;t previously possible, but now are! In the meantime, though, we&#39;ve taken the opportunity to fix a few more bugs...[/quote]

Im not sure if this is real, or if they are hoaxing us but this is bad if it&#39;s real. Looks like a hoax, it didn&#39;t take long to load hooray!</description>

              <p>[quote=“killerman93, post:1, topic:116814”][quote <a href="http://author=www.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=850" rel="nofollow noopener">author=www.runescape.com/newsitem.ws?id=850</a> ]<br>
his week we’ve made another internal upgrade to the RuneScape game engine, which makes it possible for us to do more complex/varied updates in the future.</p>
<p>This time around the interface system has had another overhaul, with a large chunk of the system completely replaced with a more powerful version. We’ve then had to adjust and retest all the old interfaces to make sure they still work under the new system (a big job!).</p>
<p>One immediate improvement you’ll notice with this update is some new ‘hot keys’ - much like the ‘control’ key can be used to run. Now, you can use F1 - F12 to open up most of your interfaces, and the ‘escape’ key will open your inventory. Once you get used to these, we’re sure you’ll find that it makes doing things much, much quicker.</p>
<p>The keys work like this:</p>
<p>Esc - Inventory<br>
F1 - Combat options<br>
F2 - Your statistics<br>
F3 - Quest Journal<br>
F4 - Equipped interface<br>
F5 - Prayer<br>
F6 - Spellbook<br>
F8 - Friends list<br>
F9 - Ignore list<br>
F10 - Options interface<br>
F11 - Emotes<br>
F12 - Music Player<br>
Control - Run</p>
<p>Most of the other changes that have been made aren’t generally things that you’ll notice immediately, but there’s a surprisingly large amount of work involved in any engine upgrade. Admittedly, it’s not the most exciting update in the short term, but it’s definitely worth it in the long run!</p>
<p>All this frantic behind the scenes activity finally means we can now get started on some (much requested) updates to some of our main interfaces - updates which weren’t previously possible, but now are! In the meantime, though, we’ve taken the opportunity to fix a few more bugs…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Im not sure if this is real, or if they are hoaxing us but this is bad if it’s real. Looks like a hoax, it didn’t take long to load hooray![/quote]</p>
<p>why would it be a hoax?..</p>
