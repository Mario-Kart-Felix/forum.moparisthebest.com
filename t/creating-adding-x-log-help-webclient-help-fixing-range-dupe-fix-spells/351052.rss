    <description>okay hey guys, well I was reading about A TON of stuff on here and i&#39;ve come down to a few things that probably havent been posted considering the &quot;search button&quot; :] also im using Pk Planet Souce+Client--&gt; http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,433417.0.html

--------------okay heres the list------------------

1.Creating/Adding a X-Log or x-system log //Fix the Wildy Range Dupe(dont know what that is in search bar type &quot;range dupe&quot;)

2. How to limit The Connections to an Ip?  // http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=337098.0

3. Reading this post http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,413731.0.html any clue on how to compile the .dat -&gt; .jar -&gt; .cache       // Also will that provaide a 24/7 host?

4.My Spell Barrage Dosent Freeze Player/Npc

5.My Spell Rain, the action rains on my head not on other player/npc

6.Is there any possible way to produce a free host thats online 24/7 //i dont want someone saying of ill host it for u ty.

7.I Have A Auto Restarter and that seems the only way to start the server, is there anyway of skipping this and just Running the server, I opened Run.bat but it says missing java or something...  //I&#39;d like to run this server myself without the autostarter because I&#39;d like the windows hidden/minized so it runs invisibly.

8.Get a list of items stats/bonus&#39;s are normal? //mine are all 0 because someone added custom items and it deleted all the other bonus&#39;s I have a temporary fix by editing the CombatExpRate 1 to 3

9.Fix The null&#39;s in Client //idk why but anyone know how to fix this(i know u have to add models and crap but anyone already fix it I mean)

10.Okay I edited the player to have owner in the source and player list but it dosent say anything..

11.Like in real runescape, your hp lvl is 99 then your actual hp is 990, how would i edit this?</description>
