    <description>Hello, Im Xo Stab,

I will be starting a server soon called Xo Scape. I really need some people to help test out server bases and staff.

--Staff--

Admins and Mods will be free, but im not handing them out. If you show me that you can handle being a admin/mod and help out the server you can become one. 

--Testers--

If you wanna help out testing the server please respond. 

--Donations--

You can donate if you want. Rember donations will be only really runescape accounts becasuse of the new runescape rule.

Thanks, 

Xo Stab
