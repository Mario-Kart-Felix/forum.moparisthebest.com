Under it should be <blockquote>if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“NAME”))<br>
{<br>
playerRights = 3;<br>
}</blockquote><br>
Put you name for NAME and you have owner rights for server. To add admins, simply make this <blockquote>if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(“ADMINNAME”))<br>
{<br>
playerRights = 2;<br>
}</blockquote><br>
Replace ADMINNAME with name of admin you adding. For modeator, just replace playerRights = 2<br>
with playerRights = 1. Tell if any probs
<p>What you mean by adding new items</p>
