              <p>I agree with Bowser; the amount payed by people who are subject to the television fee should be dependent on their income.<br>
With that said, if I was more affluent (ie, not a university trying to live on the cheap) then I’d happily pay for a completely ad-free television station. We don’t have one of those here. Our government backed station, ABC, is probably quite trashy when compared to BBC.</p>

It doesn’t state that if you are capable of receiving live television you must pay - only if you actually watch it. It’s the same as just owning a TV for gaming. If they can’t prove you actually watch terrestrial TV, they can’t prosecute you for just owning one.</p>

You’re right in what you say there, but thats not what I meant. The expenses for BBC and other public broadcasters should be payed like other things, for the tax money. Students should not need to pay, in Norway it is on  €300, and students need that money they have.</p>
<p>Yes, lower income families can get cheaper food, they can choose different types of food and save money that way. When it comes to TV it either TV or no TV, you can’t choose away BBC, but you can choose away expensive food.</p>
