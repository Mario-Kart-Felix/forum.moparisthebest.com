    <title>Two annoying bugs in my sever please help. All is appreciated</title>

    <description>Well my server is p16 v1 which is basically WhiteScape. I&#39;ve done many things to it but these bugs still stand out and I&#39;d like them fixed.

1. When I use an object like a ladder, etc I climb it before I get to it. And I attack NPC&#39;s before I get to them. I still walk to them but I attack them before I reach them and it&#39;s really annoying. I can use a ladder like 50 feet away!!!

2. This one has to do with saving my players I guess. I have full character design working, etc but when I log out it goes back to default design. Like if I get blue shirt, black pants, etc it goes back to default when I log out. And also when I have a weapon emote for say a whip with it&#39;s attack style, hold style, run style etc it works but I have to re-equip it for it to work when I log back in.

Thanks.[br][size=1]Posted on: June 02, 2007, 12:48:58 PM[/size][hr]Come on..</description>
