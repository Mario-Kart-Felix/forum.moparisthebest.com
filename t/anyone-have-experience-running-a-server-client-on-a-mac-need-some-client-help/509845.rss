    <title>Anyone have experience running a server/client on a mac? Need some client help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-have-experience-running-a-server-client-on-a-mac-need-some-client-help/509845</link>
    <description>alrighty, so I&#39;ve got the source to run via terminal.  That&#39;s not a problem.

The client however, is giving me issues.  I can&#39;t run it via the terminal or by clicking on the .class files.  When I click on the .class files, I see the little java app pop up in my dock, but then it disappears.

I&#39;ve tried to connect via the moparscape client and it connects, but than immediately disconnects.  When I look in the terminal it says that my account was registered, the game was saved, than the account was deregistered.  Not sure if that even means anything.

Either way, if anyone can try and help me figure out what&#39;s wrong, I&#39;d really appreciate it.  TV and Skype is an option - which I&#39;d prefer than posting here or PMing.  Skype is Flubby_PB</description>

<p>Then type in “cd”, and drag and drop the folder with the class files onto the terminal and click enter</p>
