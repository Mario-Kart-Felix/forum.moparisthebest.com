    <title>Webclient error please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-error-please-help/479097</link>
    <description>When I open my webclient it loads the java screen but then says error and the error says... &quot;incompatible magic value 171712836 in class file client&quot; This is my first time making a webclient so I have no clue what it means. If someone knows what it means and can help it would be great. Thanks.

If someone would be able to jar my client the correct way it would be great!</description>
