    <description>ok i have heard this complant all the time and well it happens to me alot too but i think that the mopar client the reg 1 u download from this site has an error well i figured out if u use a hellzend or another client it will not freeze on u most the time when it freezes it will be if u get something in the server that carrys an error on it well with the client the error has in it that if it is used for a long period of time on 1 server it will crash and freeze u in the game well what u need to do is fix the error that it holds which might take awhile but it is only the basic client that freezes the most so what this post is saying use another client from a server and not the basic 1 seeing how it holds errors but i will probally get flammed and this thread will get locked but just trust me on this and if u have any problems trying to find a client go to the download section of the forums to find it thanks to, my good friend in rl matt</description>

              <p>X-J-K-X is right its the server with the errors not moparscape client. thats y u have some servers that are really good and no lag (this means server has less errors) and some with lots of lag (these types have multipul errors) also im pretty sure this the  rong secction to be putting this i think u should e putting this in the help section although it wouldnt really help nobody.</p>

              <p>but they dont the the basic error prgramed in them so it will auto freeze it is a technalogical faulty client that needs to be updated badly and the errors that are in the other clients are not as bad as the 1 in the basic client</p>

              <p>Technically. Your wrong… Hellzend client or other clients dont just ignore errors… It does the same… It may miss the odd error -Error using emotes- or something like that… But other times… It doesn’t</p>
