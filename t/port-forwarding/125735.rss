    <description>Hey, Well I&#39;ve port forwarded and I still can NOT register my server online, when I try all it says is the server must be online to register and it is online with my account logged in...I&#39;ve also made ports 43594 and 5555 exceptions to my firewall so please does anyone know why this could be happening because all I want to do is get my freakin server online and running!
