<p>You have to portforward no matter what. It is simple and will take about 2-3 minutes with someone who knows what they are doing.</p>

<p>No you don’t. If you are directly connected with say a modem that only one computer is connected with, then you have no reason to forward your port because you’re the only computer so all the packets have to go to your computer. The reason most people need to forward a port is because they have a router that routes packets to other computers in the network, so because of this when someone uses your ip with the port the router is able to route that packet to your computer and not someone else on the same network. If you have a vps or dedicated server then you only need the ip address because you’re more or less a single computer connected to the internet.<br>

<p>Lets say I’ve got a few laptops/android/iPhone devices connected to my internet via WiFi. I would have to port forward, correct?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes and no, with Upnp the devices are able to do such a thing with out you needing to do anything, we have a tutorial in the tutorial section that shows how to set up a rsps with a program written by Ry60003333 that uses Upnp to do it for you. But to answer your question yes you would need to forward the port for laptops also even on wifi, but I suggest you use a wired connection. As far as I know people don’t usually run a service on an iPhone and android, but it’s still possible but would most likely have a hard time keeping things connected with wifi.</p>
