    <title>Port Forwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding/104756</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a Fr33sc4p3 Pkz source to make a server, and I&#39;m following this guide: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,134771.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,134771.0.html[/url] I cant seem to port forward correctly. [center][size=30pt]STOP!!![/size][/center]  I have been to portforward.com! Don&#39;t even suggest that. It doesn&#39;t have my router, which is an RCA DCM425. I need to port-forward with that router, however, when I put it&#39;s default gate 74.138.208.1 in the address bar, it says &quot;Page cannot be displayed&quot;. I have tryed 74.138.208.2 etc. In the past, on a different computer, I ended up using a port forwading software that I had to get a crack for. Someone please help! Thanks</description>
