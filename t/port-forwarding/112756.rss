    <title>Port Forwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding/112756</link>
    <description>Ive tried portforwarding and can&#39;t get it to work, I portforward fine but I still cannot connect to my server with no-ip

http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Linksys/WRT54G/default.htm

that is almost the exact same router that I have, wasnt sure if that would help or not though.

I followed it and still no luck. Any suggestions?

EDIT:
Alirght, i found an ip address that will connect, but when I tried to make no-ip connect to it i get an error</description>
