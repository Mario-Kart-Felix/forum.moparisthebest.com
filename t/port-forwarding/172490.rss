    <description>Hello

Im having trouble port forwarding. 
here is what i did so far

i went to windows fire wall, added the port

downloaded no-ip

set up a no-ip account, for the ip part on there, i used the ip from whatismyip.com 

i downloaded no-ip

smiley face turned happy

my modem/router is  a

actiontec gt701wg

i went to http://192.168.0.1

it brought me to my control panel, I went to advanced port forwarding.

here is what it looked like.

what do i put for the ip etc?...

I went to portforward.com and found my router, http://www.portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Actiontec/GT701WG/1st_SMTP_Server.htm

now on this guide, it says i must set up a Static IP Address in order to port forward, i tried but got confused. so is there anyway to skip this, and is this the reason why my server isnt working?

if anyone can answer any of these questions i would appreciate it. thanks!</description>
