              <p>[quote=“lothy, post:2, topic:24379”]Easy to do. Open internet explorer, and put into the address bar 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 or something similar. This is the IP address of your router on the network. If you don’t know what it is already, consult the manual that came with your particular router. The manual will also have your username and password.<br>
By default, passwords are usually things such as 1234 or password, and the username is something like admin, however, these vary from model to model.</p>
<p>Once you’re into your router, you should see a list of links, or something similar depending on your router brand. I have a Netcomm router, and it shows links to the left for different router options.<br>
Go to port forwarding, and it should bring up a page. (You may have to click something like ‘Advanced Settings’ for extra options to appear).</p>
<p>Now forward the port 43594 to the INTERNAL IP address of your computer.<br>
To get the Internal IP address of your computer, go to ‘Control Panel’ and bring up ‘Network Connections’.<br>
Having done this, click the network connection made to your router. Once you click it once, look under the ‘Network Tasks’ pane to the left of the window, and click ‘View status of this connection’.<br>
Once that window pops up, click the ‘Support’ tab. Now it will show your connection status, which will list: Address Type, IP Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway.<br>
The number next to IP Address is your computer’s internal IP address. It may look something like 192.168.1.10, which is what mine is. This is the address you need to port forward to.</p>
<p>Once you have this address, paste it into your port forwarding settings in your router, and port forward to both TCP and UDP. And that’s it, if your firewall is configured and your NO-IP DUC is set up, then you’re ready to roll.[/quote]</p>
<p>Easy as it is… people still dont get it…</p>
