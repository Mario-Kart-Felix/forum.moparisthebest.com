    <title>Port forwarding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding/14636</link>
    <description>I have forwarded the right port but i tried to connect to it, (woscape.no-ip.org) like i typed in the server name in the server thing in mopar and got onto my admin and i cant connect, it is down. I have the duc ,the run.bat running my somewhat custom project 16 v.4.5, and the port forwarded.

Personaly i think it is my Bellsouth modem, because i have to forward ports through there server, or atleast i think its there server.

can someone research my modem, the info is at.
