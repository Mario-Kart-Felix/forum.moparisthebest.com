    <description>I have looked at the pinned guide and tried that. Was not succesful. When I go to the cmd and do ipconfig it comes up with ipconfig is not recognized as an internal or external command. Also
It worked before and when it did the the default gateway was not 192.168.1 bla bla instead it was only a few digits and not anything liek that. Anyone help meee? Also that ip did not lead to my router in the browser.</description>

<p>From what I’ve seen, you seem to be wrong a lot more than you are right.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@topic</span><br>
Make sure your looking at LAN or WLAN Settings, not Ethernet or Something else.<br>
Default Gateways almost always start with 192.168.</p>

              <p>Wow. Dude not to be mean or try to flame but Learn to fucking read tutorials and the only reason why Ipconfig doesn’t work with cmd is becasue you set your PATH to java instead of C:/Windows/System32/ Which would be the default path of the computer.</p>
