    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-728-xteas/545367</link>
    <description>Well i&#39;ve just loaded a 718/728 Cache into my server but previously it was a 718/742..

Not sure but i think its loading different xteas

Does anyone know where i can find the Xteas to bring back the Building/Maps? I&#39;m missing them..

I&#39;ve deleted the packed from maps and still the same..

I would really appreciate it 

If someone could help me.. THEN THANK YOU</description>
