<p>“Improving” on PI would entail you not packing higher revision into it, but restoring it to its 317ness, and then working on things such as networking, player/npc updating, and then improving the tick based system. Turning it into an event based server or going full retard and adding this “Hyperion Game Engine” would just make it a different framework all together.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Nothing is wrong with packing higher revision data as most players like because they want a newer feel to the client.  As long as you do it all the right way it will be fine.</p>
<p>Also there are literally no event based servers I have came across within the past couple of years I’ve been working with RSPS.</p>
<p>On topic:<br>
The title is a bit misleading as it seems like you will not be improving what needs to be improved the most such as networking, player updating and the combat system.  Good luck with this project though and change the title.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
