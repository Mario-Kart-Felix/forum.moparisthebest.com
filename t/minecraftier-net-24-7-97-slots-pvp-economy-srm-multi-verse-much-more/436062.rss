    <title>MineCraftier.net [24/7] 97 Slots | PvP | Economy | SRM | Multi-Verse - Much more</title>

    <description>MineCrafiter is a fairly new server but it got semi-popular when I purchased dedicated hosting and got an IP of a popular old server. Since then we have moved on to a bigger hosting provider which now has cut the lag down to virtually none.

You can view our World Map at [url=http://184.171.251.151:8123/]http://184.171.251.151:8123/[/url]

The server has a Grand Exchange (like on RS) which you can buy and sell items etc
Server has plenty of things to do on it and sight seeing, just looking for a few more regulars.
We have a generic name, I have a lot of money to spend on hosting and advertising I just want a few dedicated people to work with to make it happen.

Server IP: 184.171.251.151

Thanks!</description>
