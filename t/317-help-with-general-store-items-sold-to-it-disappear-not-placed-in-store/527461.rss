    <title>317 Help with general store? Items sold to it disappear, not placed in store</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-help-with-general-store-items-sold-to-it-disappear-not-placed-in-store/527461</link>
    <description>Hey, on my new source I have a problem where the items I sell to the general store disappear instead of being placed in the store&#39;s inventory. On my old source items would go into the shop when sold. I tried replacing the shop handler.java and got an error at the server start. Even if the items that the general store has in stock are bought, and sold back, the stock does not go back up.

Also, if the shop.java value for the shop is &quot;1 1&quot;, all items are bought by the store for 0 coins. If the shop value is &quot;1 0&quot; then it functions as a normal store. This may be because of the interference of the PK points system that was present before.

If someone could help me figure out a way to make general stores add items to their shop when sold that&#39;d be awesome! I don&#39;t know which file controls that, but could someone give me a replacement file if they know which one it is?

Thank you!</description>
