    <title>Few problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/few-problems/531242</link>
    <description>Hello guys I am not very good at colding at all I just like to change npc locations and play around on them for personal use. Anyways..
I found a few problems and I don&#39;t know what to do I tried to look them up but couldn&#39;t find answers. Please help me. Thank. :)

1. How can I change the gameframe from 562 on this to 483 every time I log in. Because currently it goes back to 562 each time I reload. I like 483&#39;s look better. [IMG]http://i40.tinypic.com/4g4t3.png[/img]

2. How can I remove skills this server has pk skill dung and summoning I do not want them on the skills list or anything.

3. How can I fix it clicking friends tab or whatever on the bottom row when I drop an item. Like when I click drop if its over the friend&#39;s,enemy or clanchat or anything on bottom row it will open that tab when dropping that item. It gets annoying lol

Thanks to anyone who will spend a little time to explain theses fixes to me (a newb wanna be colder :P).</description>
