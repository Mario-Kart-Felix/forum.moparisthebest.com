<p>I guarantee I worked more on my server than you have on this thing. The reason the server was a Delta was because I began developing it in 2010. Do you know how many game breaking bugs I had to fix? Or basic features that are taken for granted on modern clients I had to add? You don’t concider the work I had to put in to make the server playable for 20 people.</p>
<p>So you want to know what is unique about that server:<br>
-unmoderated server (no rules/staff)<br>
-every item IG has the exact same significance<br>
-drop trade is the only way to trade<br>
-you can view other people’s banks<br>
-over 1.5k of actual custom items<br>
-Donator rank was only awarded for contirbuting to the server (I.e helping new players) and not from paying<br>
-You would never lose items upon death<br>
-I created my own custom quest<br>
-there were no shops</p>
<p>But yeah, you’re right. Everything I listed is on every server ever created.</p>
<p>I will be looking forward to how many players this server can pull.</p>

Ending the argument here:<br>
There’s like 3 people on your thread that say "godzhell remake"<br>
If your server was unique, people wouldn’t be calling it a remake.</p>

<p>I guarantee I worked more on my server than you have on this thing. The reason the server was a Delta was because I began developing it in 2010. Do you know how many game breaking bugs I had to fix? Or basic features that are taken for granted on modern clients I had to add? You don’t concider the work I had to put in to make the server playable for 20 people.</p>
<p>So you want to know what is unique about that server:<br>
-unmoderated server (no rules/staff)<br>
-every item IG has the exact same significance<br>
-drop trade is the only way to trade<br>
-you can view other people’s banks<br>
-over 1.5k of actual custom items<br>
-Donator rank was only awarded for contirbuting to the server (I.e helping new players) and not from paying<br>
-You would never lose items upon death<br>
-I created my own custom quest<br>
-there were no shops</p>
<p>But yeah, you’re right. Everything I listed is on every server ever created.</p>
<p>I will be looking forward to how many players this server can pull.<br>

Ending the argument here:<br>
There’s like 3 people on your thread that say "godzhell remake"<br>
If your server was unique, people wouldn’t be calling it a remake.</p>

<p>And FYI, I was a moderator on GodzHell. The server wasn’t a remake, the only thing the same was the home area. GodzHell is a historic RSPS and was my favorite, so when people seen my home it instinctively reminded them of GodzHell. But obviously you were too young to have played back then.</p>
<p>Again, provided the unique features, got 20+ players daily, yet you still say the server failed and isn’t unique. Your logic XD.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Why would ashes have the same importance as an AGS? That might be unique, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. An AGS is supposed to be a lot more rare than ashes because ashes are a very common item that server little to no purpose, while an AGS is an awesome weapon that rarely drops from a supply consuming boss.</p>
<p>And as for the drop trading, “provides a risk of getting scammed”, if I liked every other feature on a server that had no real, secure trading system, I wouldn’t play it. It might sound “unique” as an idea, but in practice it makes no sense. Obviously your server is unique, but being unique doesn’t mean that it’s any good.</p>

Oh yeah, I forgot every server is made in a way which ashes have the same importance as an AGS. Or that in order to trade with people you have to drop trade which provides a risk of getting scammed. 10/10 analysis, my friend.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Why would ashes have the same importance as an AGS? That might be unique, but that doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. An AGS is supposed to be a lot more rare than ashes because ashes are a very common item that server little to no purpose, while an AGS is an awesome weapon that rarely drops from a supply consuming boss.</p>
<p>And as for the drop trading, “provides a risk of getting scammed”, if I liked every other feature on a server that had no real, secure trading system, I wouldn’t play it. It might sound “unique” as an idea, but in practice it makes no sense. Obviously your server is unique, but being unique doesn’t mean that it’s any good.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, 20+ people seemed to adapt to it well.</p>
<p>The reason ashes, or any item had equal rarity was due to the fact you could only receive items through a mystery box, which new items were added and old items were replaced inside the box, therefore leaving the old items discontinued. Boxes were not obtained from PvMing so that is why AGS had no significance, and the aim of the game was to collect every item in the game. Because of the typical server portraying ashes to be some sort of scum item, you instinctively think it is worthless.</p>
<p>Also, it is up to you to make the drop trade secure. You are suppost to find a legit, trustworthy player in which you both can partake in trading transactions.</p>

<p>Ashes are some sort of scum item, because they have no use. Being rare isn’t useful, it’s just a trait than an item can have. An item like ashes, which can’t be worn or flaunted in any way except by dropping it or showing pictures of it isn’t very useful. In fact, since you can’t trade them, a picture is the safest way to communicate your collection, which is fine, I guess, but trading in-game is more exciting than looking at a picture of a bunch of items.</p>
<p>And also, I didn’t say that the server couldn’t work. I just wouldn’t play it.</p>

<p>I did enable a feature in which you are able to view other players banks. Which avoids people providing fake pictures.</p>
<p>I understand. I never ever said that the server was perfect. But the server worked and was unique. I find it offending when people question the uniqueness of the server. But yeah, I’m sure many people hate it like yourself which is fine, and many people loved it. I was more than happy to have 20+ people play it daily but what everyone should understand is that it was unique.</p>
