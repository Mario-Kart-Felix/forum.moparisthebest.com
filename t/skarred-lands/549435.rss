[anchor=about]                [size=18pt]About Skarred[/size][/anchor]
     Skarred-Lands is a server that I consider as &#39;mine&#39;. However, I did not create the base for the source. It&#39;s base is a PI server. The client is a refactored/renamed 317 client that is loading higher content, such as: 602 items, ~562 gameframe, and 474 or 508 maps... I have personally put in a lot of work to this base, regarding writing skills and new content. I have not finished re-writing all skills, as I keep going back and re-writing a skill I wrote earlier. I&#39;ve decided to go with a concept of loading skill data (Ex: mining rocks, or exp/anims/log ids for firemaking) from JSON because of how fast and flexible JSON is with GSON. And finally, I plan to make Skarred-Lands into [u]my[/u] version of RuneScape; [u]Not yours.[/u]

[anchor=updates]                [size=18pt]Update Log[/size][/anchor]
     I have been slacking on my log in the last few weeks, so a lot of it is based on memory. I do use github for my project, and it is on a private repo, but the naming for the greater portion of my recent commits do not represent what they actually did. I do not do daily commits and I also like to take breaks. Do not expect a daily log.

              <p>As stated <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,671566.msg4502752.html#msg4502752" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>, I’ve decided to join the EdgevillePK development team.</p>
<p>This will bring some questions up for a few of my ‘followers’ I’m sure, so I’ll try to answer what I assume would be asked, here:<br>
I <span class="bbcode-b">do not</span> plan on releasing the source code for my server/client now that I’ve joined a team. I’ve put too much time into this to just let it like that.<br>
I <span class="bbcode-b">do</span> want to continue this. I cannot say what the future holds, but I don’t want to end the source so… half-finished. Hopefully, I’ll be able to work on it along side working with the dev team, but it sadly isn’t a priority.</p>
<p>The worst case scenario is: EdgevillePK becomes popular and I have 0 time to manage this. That would simply just mean there would be no development if/until EdgevillePK was “finished” (Interpret that how you will). It doesn’t mean it’s over.</p>

<p>Nothing major; but noting it as to show I’m still progressing (even if it’s slow).</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Started Diner for P.O.H.
Fixed bug when removing curtains in P.O.H.
Fixed deleting objects in P.O.H (Some objects would not delete, some deleted EXTRA objects :P).
Fixed lottery sending message even if player had filter on.</code></pre>
<p>I need to rewrite the deleting room code… But in order to do that I also have to rewrite my interference code… (Basically, checking if there is a room in front of you or not).<br>
Believe it or not that little bit takes a good hunk of code as I have to check all directions near the door AND player, as the door they clicked might have been the one from the room they were trying to delete.</p>

Added more server &gt; client packets:</p>
<p>64// Clears tiles in 8x8 square of items/objects to their normal state<br>
147// Player to object<br>
105// Plays sound at coords ? (Cannot test as music doesn’t work)</p>
<p>Only packet missing now is packet 60.<br>

<p>[quote]Hey guys, sorry I haven’t posted any updates recently.</p>

<p>No gifs or anything as this is an announcement post, not an update, but here’s a couple things I’ve done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added room deletion (Need to fix rug deletion).</li>
<li>Fixed object deletion when rooms are re-built (Before it would show empty objects where the room objects would normally be, until you placed the room)</li>
<li>Added garden objects to the building interfaces.<br>

<p>Instead of using the gatestone for dungeoneering, I’ve decided to use it globally - that means all around the map.<br>
How it works is simple:<br>
Purchase a gatestone from the Etheral Guide (Near the dungeon portal).<br>
Go to whatever location.<br>
Drop the gatestone.<br>
Teleport back to it at anytime by using the command ::ggs.<br>
Your gatestone will be returned to your inventory as you teleport.<br>

<p>I have also finished up the kitchen for Player Owned Houses.[/quote][/quote]Neat concept!</p>

Small updates still. Still bitching at Experian… All their phone options for customer support send me to the website. The website sends me to either A) The phone (AGAIN) or B) Email. I attempted to contact them via email, and they say to contact em over the phone. Every time I call them, the line goes dead when it’s supposed to transfer me to a person… I tried telling them this in an email, but their response is “Some matters can only be handled through the phone due to bla bla”. AKA, they won’t help.</p>
<p>Updates:</p>
<p><code>Moved site to new domain(.net instead of .com) due to the domain host charging $50 to renew. It was cheaper to just get a new one and go through my webhost (They charge like $10 annually)
Updated any/all references to the site within the server (And other parts of the site) to the new domain.
Rewrote the Recipe for Disaster minigame - This code has been irking me for some time.
Rewrote the Lottery game - Now the lottery saves when: Server closes, a player wins the lotto, a player enters, a player claims their unclaimed prize. It saves unclaimed prize data and current participants (By playername).
Misc. code cleanup</code></p>

<p>Been busy dealing with one problem after another… Haven’t really concentrated on <span class="bbcode-i">any</span> project.</p>
<p>Some of the shit I’ve been dealing with:<br>
My identity was  leaked online says Experian (The credit people…).<br>
I attempt to sign up to the complementary privacy protection due to it being “their fault” the servers were hacked and my info leaked, but they say they have no information on me (WHUT??),<br>
Days later: Amazon says they’re worried my information was posted online, and that they (amazon) changed my password for security reasons.</p>

<p>I had an idea to implement a jackpot system CSGO scene is so hyped about nowadays into an RSPS. People put in-game items into one collector (a chest for example), a timer starts to countdown, when max item amount has been put into the chest or time runs out the winner is drawn, the more value one player puts into the chest, the more chances (%) he has to win the jackpot. You might want to check it out yourself if you didn’t understand me, but it would be a pretty cool addition to a server with good player base.</p>

<blockquote>While finishing up the parlor room, I had encountered a couple height mapping issues which I didn't get earlier. I made sure that there should no longer be any problems when you attempt to build on height levels above 'normal' (above 3). I also had to play around with the curtains as they didn't want to display properly when I first started.

<p>I wanted to make the gif a higher quality… But GIFCam wouldn’t allow me to set the max memory about 2.147m (They stored it in an int <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ) kb. Due to this, the program crapped out during saving… I actually had to record the above one twice as the first cut was too big.<br>
There’s about 1100 frames in the current gif, btw.</p>

Nope. There haven’t been any recent posts because I can’t post twice <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I don’t really want to release lots of information about the “grand scheme” of what I’m working on.<br>
But I’ll give you guys some teasers/etc.</p>
<p>In my last post, I showed off the construct map region packet. Well, I’ve been working on <span class="bbcode-b">Player Owned Houses</span> recently. Of course I’m sure this brings up a lot of questions, the biggest of them being “why”. Well, I can’t say too much why right now. One of the major reasons why, is because this is a new “feat” for me, as player owned houses is probably the most complex thing I’ve added to a server.</p>
<p>As most of you are aware, the 317/377 cache does not have the interfaces for construction. That’s because construction wasn’t added until revision 474 (sooner? later?). Because of this, I actually had to go and make my own.<br>
I still have to finish up the furniture interface (about 80% done), but here’s the room selection interface I made:<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/k3ZIW/8e6cfed0c3.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
(As you can see, I have a thing for saying BETA apparently)<br>
The items on the interface are not the “final” ones. As they were sent using a command that uses a default zoom, when it’s finished they’ll be more clear.</p>
<p>A quick little show off on POH’s:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i.imgur.com/spjFfyI.gif" title="spjFfyI.gif" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/spjFfyI.gif" alt width="690" height="447"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div><br>
Before someone says it: I already know the doors are going the wrong way.<br>
(I also had to add the “There’s no place like home” interface :P)[/quote]</p>

              <p>As arham quoted. There is no “expected” release date. The reason for that is because I’m going at my own pace and taking plenty of breaks and free time. Doing so will “prevent” me from being totally burnt out on my RSPS.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m still working plenty on it.</p>
<p>With a bit of help from lare, I got the construct map region packet working.<br>
Here’s a fun little gif showing that off:<br>
<img src="http://skarred-lands.net/randmedia/mapwalking.gif" alt width="" height=""><br>
Note: I said slayer tower but should have said fenkenstrain’s castle.</p>
<p>If you don’t get how I’m using the packet:<br>
I sent the data for the Canifis region in the construct map region packet. After that it was just a matter of running to the end of the region to make it load the next chunk, therefore causing the map data I originally sent to be replaced by what actually exists in the region.</p>

Thanks to whatever mod reset the edit timer on my topic, I updated the OP a little bit. All I did was re-organize the media and throw the latest images into the section.</p>
<p>Still looking for someone to help with my dungeoneering interface.</p>
<p>Also, other news: My new skill system is working rather well. The conversion process is going to take a bit though. But in the end it will be easier to use.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Is this server going to be released to the public, or is it just for fun and learning purposes? I would definitely love to play if it was released, I know that a lot of work has been put into it.[/quote]</p>

<p>Nope, there’s no planned release date for the server. If I find the content is good enough (by my standards), and I feel the server is complete enough, I will host it again. However, I have no idea if/when that will happen.</p>
