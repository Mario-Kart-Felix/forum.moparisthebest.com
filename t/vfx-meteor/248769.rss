New topic cause this one is very different. This is the final test shot. Haha sounds funny.

This is the last of my test shots before the actual movie, and doubles as my special effects project.

That&#39;s why there&#39;s three takes. The final shot, a slowed version to see the details, and the raw footage.

Let it play through once, for me it only shows like four frames the first go round. Then click play again to restart it and it&#39;ll be fine.

<p>I think its pretty good for the time you were given to do this, but exps covered the crit for me.[/quote]</p>
<p>OH YEAH I forgot I only told you that.</p>
<p>All of this was done in less than 24hours minus rendering time.</p>
<p>I shot the footage Wednesday morning, and went straight to work. Project was due this afternoon. So after work I spent a LOT of time setting all the basic shit up. Then let both programs render overnight. Fucked some of it up so I rendered it again while I was at school. Came home, and then composited and did all of the video editing and effects.</p>
<p>All in all, I spent about a half a day on this.</p>
