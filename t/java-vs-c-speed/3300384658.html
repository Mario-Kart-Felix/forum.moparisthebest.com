<p>Wait, what? Either I’m misunderstanding what you’re saying or I’ve got it wrong. You’re saying because the Java API’s Math classes are written and optimised for speed my point is proven wrong?</p>
<p>Obviously the API is written and optimised, but the API can’t really be argued into this since they wouldn’t have written the Java API in C++. Am I missing your point?</p>
<p>My original point was a little blunt, I’d rather have said you wouldn’t choose either or purely based on their speed in a particular operation - there’s far too many other things to consider (cannot be bothered arguing this out with examples). Both have advantages and disadvantages in different areas (thus brining me to my original final paragraphs) but I’m not one too change my post after it’s been quoted, plus that train of thought is way too rational for me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>I don’t know to what extent you know Java, but any function prototype can be declared ‘native’, initialized in a C/C++ module, and then loaded into its environment. This is what most of the API does for the sole purpose of reducing execution time; proving your original statement inaccurate.</p>

<p>I think we confused each other a little here, and I certainly wasn’t expecting a debate out of it. So it took me off guard <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I could backtrack and re-explain certain things but it would probably create more ambiguity, and then I’d slip up and you’d find larger flaws in my “argument” (tehehe) despite the fact there really is no argument to be had (because you shouldn’t be choosing Java or C++ for a task dependant purely on its relative speed at executing said task, <em>breathe</em>).</p>
<p>Yes, some methods are written natively in C for a more optimal performance. On the other hand, is the whole argument flawed because the core of the JVM is C? Java couldn’t exist (as we know it) without C, therefore Swings and roundabouts. Obviously the JVM could be written in anything, C was probably chosen for speed.</p>
<p>EDIT: the thing that threw me off understanding your point was because I said application, not expecting someone to throw an internal component of Java at me. Obviously you could go off and find some program written in Java that uses the JNI, but then isn’t that just proving my point that they aren’t comparable? On a simple level what you’re saying is C/C++ is faster because Java uses methods written in C. To which I reply dear sir, then why does Java even exist?</p>
<p>I should probably mention here that I haven’t got a fucking clue what you’re trying to prove.</p>

That being said, I’ll reiterate that the prime example I was referring to were math algorithms which are written natively and can be written in pure Java, yet chosen not to.</p>
<p>[quote=“Greeny, post:23, topic:330038”]On a simple level what you’re saying is C/C++ is faster because Java uses methods written in C. To which I reply dear sir, then why does Java even exist?[/quote] I do not think you understand the concept of high-level programming languages versus lower level ones. Lower level languages, such as C and ASM, provide the user direct access to things higher level languages don’t, like the ability to directly interact with the application’s virtual memory. Higher level languages, like Java and C#, provide a huge API to work with, along with the comfort of knowing that the application is ran in a “controlled environment”. These usually have an enormous amount of layers on top of the actual native code executed, which obviously explains natively compiled languages’ speed advantage over those that are not (not taking into consideration JIT compilation - which even then provides a startup delay).</p>
<p>Ollie, my point was that C/C++ is, in times used over languages like Java for the speed advantage they hold, to which I added as proof that the primary example is the Java API itself.</p>

        <p>Java is significantly slower in practise than C++ (or most similar languages) on most applications where such a thing matters. But IMHO everyone actually knows that already.</p>
<p>A proper JIT compiler is or would certainly be capable of generating code that is similar to C++s, and it even has an easier time optimizing certain things (such as using processor specific instructions), but Java is burdened by the language itself. The garbage collector, checked arrays / references, heap-based memory model, etc.</p>
<p>And most of all, in real applications performance does not only depend on the actual processing speed, but on memory efficiency as well. And though the Java JIT compiler is currently kinda nice, its memory usage tends to be insane. Even Mono seems to be significantly more memory efficient. Things might actually get better when they add the new Java GC in 1.7, but I doubt it. We shall see.</p>
<p>Might be noteworthy tho, that it takes significant knowledge and experience to be able to optimize a C++ or even a C program properly, wheras Java is simple and protective towards the programmer by design, so it is easier.</p>

-.-’</p>
<p>I think we confused each other a little here, and I certainly wasn’t expecting a debate out of it. So it took me off guard <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I could backtrack and re-explain certain things but it would probably create more ambiguity, and then I’d slip up and you’d find larger flaws in my “argument” (tehehe) despite the fact there really is no argument to be had (because you shouldn’t be choosing Java or C++ for a task dependant purely on its relative speed at executing said task, <em>breathe</em>).</p>
<p>Yes, some methods are written natively in C for a more optimal performance. On the other hand, is the whole argument flawed because the core of the JVM is C? Java couldn’t exist (as we know it) without C, therefore Swings and roundabouts. Obviously the JVM could be written in anything, C was probably chosen for speed.</p>
<p>EDIT: the thing that threw me off understanding your point was because I said application, not expecting someone to throw an internal component of Java at me. Obviously you could go off and find some program written in Java that uses the JNI, but then isn’t that just proving my point that they aren’t comparable? On a simple level what you’re saying is C/C++ is faster because Java uses methods written in C. To which I reply dear sir, then why does Java even exist?</p>
<p>I should probably mention here that I haven’t got a fucking clue what you’re trying to prove.<br>
[/quote]I see you rethought your argument and edited your post. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Regardless, I was not referring to the JVM’s glue code when I say that much of the API uses native functions, I was referring to the classes which functions could be emulated in Java without a problem yet are elected to perform the operations at hand natively, due to the favorable speed native code provides over Java. That being said, I’ll reiterate that the prime example I was referring to were math algorithms which are written natively and can be written in pure Java, yet chosen not to.</p>
<p>[quote author=Greeny link=topic=426425.msg3135049#msg3135049 date=1266875145]<br>
On a simple level what you’re saying is C/C++ is faster because Java uses methods written in C. To which I reply dear sir, then why does Java even exist?[/quote] I do not think you understand the concept of high-level programming languages versus lower level ones. Lower level languages, such as C and ASM, provide the user direct access to things higher level languages don’t, like the ability to directly interact with the application’s virtual memory. Higher level languages, like Java and C#, provide a huge API to work with, along with the comfort of knowing that the application is ran in a “controlled environment”. These usually have an enormous amount of layers on top of the actual native code executed, which obviously explains natively compiled languages’ speed advantage over those that are not (not taking into consideration JIT compilation - which even then provides a startup delay).</p>
<p>Ollie, my point was that C/C++ is, in times used over languages like Java for the speed advantage they hold, to which I added as proof that the primary example is the Java API itself.[/quote]</p>
<p>Heh, I take your point, I don’t really think there’s much to be said, as they both work in such different ways. You unfortunately misinterpreted the sarcasm of part of my post, When I asked “why does Java even exist?” it wasn’t because I didn’t understand. I was trying to make the point that Java was made following C/C++ as a higher level language, where the developers knew it would but somewhat slower in certain aspects (I obviously don’t need to explain this to you, you said it to me yourself). So in that sense they are most likely to be used for different tasks. I can’t deny the overlap in projects which could be done in either, however my argument is you’d have more of a reason than just speed to choose one over the over.</p>
<p>I can’t really see the point in debating this out, as really it is personal opinion. If it suits you, you can argue your point to be more valid than mine but I don’t consider myself to be more knowledgeable than you on this topic so I really don’t mind  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

        <p>In my opinion: Java + JIT is as fast and can be faster than C. Why? Everything C can do the JVM can do with the bonus that the JVM can optimise to suit the CPU architecture and other bottlenecks that can change depend on system loads etc.</p>
<p>As an example take a math intensive algorithm. The JIT should have no problem taking a Java implementation and optimising it to suit the specific CPU instructions available to it. In the BEST case the C program can do: if(cpu1) { program1(); } else if (cpu2) {…} The issue with that is that it takes up more space and so there is a trade off. The JVM does not have that trade off. While the JIT code may be bigger it only needs to support &lt;super_fast_instruction&gt; once rather than any number of times in multiple C libraries spread throughout the machine.</p>
<p>So from a theoretical standpoint, ignoring startup / compiling times, Java will always be faster since C will always have a trade off. The only limitation on that is if the ingenuity of the C programers is better than the Java programers. But of course due to the nature of open source one can simply steal from the other.</p>
<p>So the only slowness can be attributed to the startup time. What I don’t understand is why all Java classes can’t be JITed and cached. It would significantly cut down on startup time since what you are effectively caching is the internal in-memory representations of Java classes. All you have to do is ‘link’ them which you would have to do with C anyway. Why Java doesnt implement cached JITed classes is beyond me.</p>

        <p>Another thing is that in C++ the memory efficiency depends on the programmers knowledge and skill whereas java does it for you. Since the garbage collector has been revised several times and written by professional programmers, which know what their doing, the memory management must be better than something written badly in C. Although if someone does it properly in C obviously it will be better.</p>

<p>JIT compilers can indeed be theorethically as fast as native programs. They simply aren’t. It would certainly be nice if they were, but at the moment it’s just not that way, probably because of the issues I already mentioned, and some others. In the case of Java and other modern languages, the memory model they work under is meant to be friendly towards the programmer and safe (Garbage Collector, bounds checking, etc), which has a cost. This is especially true for the Java one, as C# does have some native unsafe ops.</p>
<p>It might be noteworthy that theorethically as well there’s nothing preventing a C++ compiler from using processor-specific instructions or extensions (Visual Studio for instance allows that option) or even optimizing itself on runtime polymorphically.</p>
<p>Also, C++ is just a language and a JIT compiler / VM for C++ would be perfectly possible. In fact, it exists already (LLVM). Performance wise the potential of a C++ JIT compiler would be greater, as C++ is significantly less restrictive (no need to check for array overflows, for valid pointers, etc), unlike Java, which does require such checks. Of course, you might be willing to make that performance sacrifice (LLVM itself probably is) to get some of these benefits.</p>

        <p>It would also be nice if Java permitted ‘unsafe’ operations, like a direct reference to a block of memory, similar to how C# has it. Because, as many said before, speed is not the actual issue with Java, its the overuse of memory which distances programmers away from it. Internal libraries, like AWT, use a SHITLOAD of memory; creating a simple frame, for example, with no additional features already occupies around 20 MB RAM, if not more. Although the tasks AWT accomplishes is worthy of the memory it occupies because of the difficulty to have an 100% cross-platform graphical user interface library (along with event-handling, and additional utilities), I am sure that if they were to reduce the amount of class-hierarchy involved, it would make a noticeable difference memory-wise; this applies not only with AWT, but with the entire API.</p>

<p>The reason Java is used for those however is not performance. They simply are willing to sacrifice performance in favour of different benefits that Java brings. Quite often the VMs for certain processors or phones are not even JIT compiled. (And some phones such as Iphones do refuse to use Java or pseudo-interpreted technologies).</p>
<p>The benefits are its cross-platform features (and hence code reuse potential), sandboxing ability, and programmer availability. Performance is of particular importance for some applications, but it is not important for others. Java, C#, C++, C, PHP, Python, they all have different features, some of them are even particularly slow, but all of them (and others) have their place and are probably the best for certain purposes or in certain situations.</p>

I was actually thinking about environments such as spacecraft, which were very very limited in their computing resources (at least back in the day).</p>
