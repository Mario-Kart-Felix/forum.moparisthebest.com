    <title>Possible dice scam?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/possible-dice-scam/408120</link>
    <description>Well

today i was a dice host, i had well over 1.5B+ But then this kid came and diced me for 200M, he won, then again for 400M, he won, and last 500M to clean me, he won. I managed to keep 200-300M because i scammed him, but then i did some searching like how did he win all those stakes in a row..

found this out in topdice, one of the most known dicing websites

DO NOT ACCEPT THE CERTIFICATE OF THIS SITE UNLESS YOU WISH TO OBTAIN A VIRUS. IF YOU ALREAY DID, SCAN YOUR COMPUTER!

They say the only way to evade this is resetting your dice ( Switching sides ), and avoid being snipped. Also logging out and back in.</description>

<p>Oh well, I’ll keep it here as a warning to others about the site, otherwise it may just be posted again and nobody will know.</p>
