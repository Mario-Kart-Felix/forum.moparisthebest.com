    <description>How can i fix this shop dupe? When there is a lot of junk in a shop, and you put a rare item in there, then buy the rare item, you can buy multiples of it. It only happens every once in a while, but its ruining my economy so bad. Anyone know how to fix this?</description>

              <p>are you sure they can buy it mutliple times? Ive never heard of this before but still what you can do is this…</p>
<p>where the server’s shop handling methods are for the buying</p>
<p>see if it has like an if statement that</p>
<p>makes sure you cant buy 5 or 10 as long as theres not that many in stock.</p>
<p>If it does then its probably a different dupe.</p>
<p>and if someones told you thats how they did it then there probably lieing.</p>
