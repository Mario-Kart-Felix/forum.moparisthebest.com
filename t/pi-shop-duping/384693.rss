    <title>[PI] Shop duping</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-shop-duping/384693</link>
    <description>So people have been duping on my server, because when you sell junk to a store, and put the item in you want to dupe, you can sometimes get multiple of that item that you want to dupe. What could this be due to? Is there something i need to change?</description>
