    <description>Ok when i open my massacred eco source and want to get the server to go up i try to run but it says the system cannot find the path specified. 
Press any key to continue....
What do i do? Also how do i change the ip of the source so that it uses mine? I could use the local host but im not sure how to get the source and client to connect to the local host because i have no experience what so ever. Also some1 on diff posts always say something about changing the batch file thing with the java version you have i have java 6 update 25 version 6.0.260 and then java tm se development kit 6 version 1.6.0.0 which is the jdk version you need i justneed how to get all the compiler and stuff to work. Also i have windows 32 and in the edit part of the run and others it says (x86) wat do i do about that!</description>

              <p>Change the JDK version to the one you have i.e 25.  Although your new, you should be looking though basic server tutorials because we have enough of this in this section.</p>
