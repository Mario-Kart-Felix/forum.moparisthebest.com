<p>Technology is a pretty vague term, which could include most things humans create. I’m going to narrow the question down to what would happen if all the computers died. There would be mass chaos. Just thinking about satellites and space stations and advanced weapons programs, and of course electronic banking, we’d probably be facing an apocalyptic situation fairly quickly.</p>
