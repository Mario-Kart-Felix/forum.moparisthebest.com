    <title>Everybody can log in with any pass in any acc bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/everybody-can-log-in-with-any-pass-in-any-acc-bug/538210</link>
    <description>I have a source and client for experiments
Now this bug is really annoying
I made a test account called: Test
and pass: 123
then log in and then i get this: [img]http://i43.tinypic.com/1zeleud.png[/img] (READ THE PICTURE)
Then i logged out and then i just simply put a 4 behind my password like this: 1234
And then it still logs in on the same account but then with a different password.
Idk how to fix this because im a noob and i never saw this before.

Help is really much appreciated.</description>
