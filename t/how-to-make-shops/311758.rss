    <description>[center][size=20pt][u]How to Make Shops.[/u][/size][/center]

[b]Description: This is a tutorial on how to make shops - made mostly for beginners.
Difficulty (1-10): 1/10[/b]

[b]Step 1: [/b]Find an NPC that you will be using for your shop. Make sure that the NPC can Trade or Talk. You can find the NPC ID&#39;s on the Moparscape Client.

[b]Step 2:[/b] Add the NPC ID to [b]autospawn.cfg[/b]
It should look like this:
[code]spawn = xxx	####	####	0	0	0	0	0	2	seller[/code]
The xxx is the NPC ID. 
The next set of ####&#39;s are the cords of where the NPC will be located.
Finally, the next set of ####&#39;s are the cords aswell.
[b]To get the cords: Stand at any location that you want the NPC to be located at. Type ::mypos and you should get the cords.[/b]

[b]Step 3:[/b] Open shop.cfg.
Example:
[code]shop = ##	Herb Shop				2	2	(itemid)      (amount)       (itemid)       (amount)       (ect)        (ect)[/code]
The ## will be your shop ID.
&quot;Herb Shop&quot; will be the name of your shop.
And the others are explained ; item id, amount, etc.

[b]Step 4:[/b] Open client.java and search for this
[code]WanneShop = 30;[/code]
Keep scrolling down until you see a lot of wanneshops.

[b]Step 5:[/b] Now add
[code]else if (NPCID == ####) { // Id of Npc
PutNPCCoords = true;
WanneShop = ##; //Id of shop
}[/code]

Replace the first set of #&#39;s with the NPC ID that you chose for your shop. 
The second set of #&#39;s is the shop ID (it must be the same as the shop ID you provided in shop.cfg.

Save - compile - and you&#39;re done! Thanks for reading, and post below if you have any troubles, or any useful tips to provide more help to this tutorial.
