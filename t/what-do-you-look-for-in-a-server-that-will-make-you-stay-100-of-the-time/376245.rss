    <title>What do you look for in a server that will make you stay 100% of the time?</title>

    <description>I guess it doesn&#39;t matter what I want my own game to have, it only matters what the people want. I need to know what all of you like seeing in servers. Do you like servers where nothing is required levels to wear, servers where you get a 99 in a matter of an hour, servers that start you off max stats, servers that allow you to spawn items, etc. Tell me briefly or in detail what you like.</description>

              <p>Okay new question guys.</p>
<p>What do you want/like to see the second you log in for the first time? Like custom home areas, spawned portals to take you places, npcs, etc. Or do you just like the original lumbridge home area with the men and women? Like what does the home area when you log in have to have to appeal to you and make you stay? How convenient should things be, like accessing items (excluding the item prices), banking, teleporting/getting around?</p>

That’s basically how your server was. You used to turn it on for a few hours and get like 10+ online in no time.</p>
<p>Im actually working on making an old source like pimpscape stable and host it to gauge player reactions to it.</p>

There shouldn’t even be a donator rank.</p>
<p>Donations are to support the server, not to pay for your benefits.<br>

<p>I agree…[/quote]<br>
Though hardly anybody wants to ‘donate’ if you should even call it that unless they get something in return</p>

Well you guys are saying skilling and an economy but when I had my server that way no one played. They’d log in, say this server sucks, and log out.<br>

<p>You have to be committed and implement your ideas and feelings into your server, you can’t just quit because some people don’t like it. When I create my servers I do them for the sense of achievement and for my friends.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well I didn’t mentally quit, I physically quit. I couldn’t keep paying and afford that damn vps. After 2 months of constant and constant advertising, I still had like maybe 7 people. Bull shit. Trust me. A LOT of my ideas and feelings went into my server.</p>
