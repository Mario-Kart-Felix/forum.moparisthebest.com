    <description>[center][size=14pt][i][b]Command Rankings, and how to use them properly.[/b][/i][/size]
As you see in most servers there are signs and symbols when coding, for example when adding in commands. 

[code]&lt;=[/code]

This sign means equal to, or lesser than and usually a number comes after it to show you the highest rank to be able to use it, and anything lesser than that rank will be capable to use it as well.

[code]&gt;=[/code]

This sign means equal to, or greater than and as I stated before a number usually comes after it. Though this time it shows you the highest rank, and any other greater ranks that are capable of using the following command.

[code]==[/code]

This sign solidifies the rank, nothing greater, or lesser than the specific rank issued will be capable of using this command.

[code]&amp; and &amp;&amp;[/code]

For boolean arguments, the single ampersand constitutes the (unconditional) &quot;logical AND&quot; operator while the double ampersand (&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;) is the &quot;conditional logical AND&quot; operator. That is to say that the single ampersand always evaluates both arguments whereas the double ampersand will only evaluate the second argument if the first argument is true.

[code]||[/code]

(&quot;||&quot;) is the &quot;conditional logical OR&quot; operator. These operators exhibit ways only if needed so. It is as well pretty much related to the (&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;). 

[code]!=[/code] 
This sign here pretty much means not equal to. 

[b][size=14pt][i]Here is an example.[/i][/size][/b]

[code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;spawn&quot;)&amp;&amp;c.playerRights == 3) {[/code]

This solidifies only the person who has the player rights 3 able to use the command. Nothing lesser than, or greater than is capable of using the command.

[code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;spawn&quot;)&amp;&amp;c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {[/code]

This is now changed so that anything equal to owner rights, or greater than owner rights now capable of using the command.

[code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;spawn&quot;)&amp;&amp;c.playerRights &lt;= 3) {[/code]

This is now changed so that anything equal to owner rights, or lesser than owner rights now capable of using the command.

[u]________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/u]

[b][size=14pt][i]Setting a command for a specific player.[/i][/size][/b]
First of all let me explain how to set a command for a specific player.

[code]equalsIgnoreCase[/code]

Determines whether two String objects contain the same data, ignoring the case of the letters in the String.
Meaning whether it contains capitals or not, it will still grab the correct whole texts within the brackets.

[code]playerName[/code]

playerName obviously determines the players username he whom created his account with.

[code](&quot;&quot;)[/code]

This is where you place the players username or whole text.

[i][b][size=14pt]Here is an example.[/size][/b][/i]

[code]if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;npc&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Encryption&quot;)) {[/code]

As you see I have set the command to myself, showing both the command and whom it was set to.
[u]________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________[/u]

It&#39;s very simple but most do not know the following of which I&#39;ve stated. I&#39;m also not entirely aware if this is the correct section for posting my little lesson. This tutorial can go on forever that&#39;s why I made it related to player commands in order for you to get an idea of it when you come across it while developing your servers. Players are more than welcome to add on, or ask for anything else related to these case. Thank-you.[/center]</description>

<p>You can literally find a better explanation for this and more on like the first page of the java tutorial on the oracle website.</p>

As you see in most servers there are signs and symbols when coding, for example when adding in commands.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This sign means equal to, or lesser than and usually a number comes after it to show you the highest rank to be able to use it, and anything lesser than that rank will be capable to use it as well.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This sign means equal to, or greater than and as I stated before a number usually comes after it. Though this time it shows you the highest rank, and any other greater ranks that are capable of using the following command.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This sign solidifies the rank, nothing greater, or lesser than the specific rank issued will be capable of using this command.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>For boolean arguments, the single ampersand constitutes the (unconditional) “logical AND” operator while the double ampersand ("&amp;&amp;") is the “conditional logical AND” operator. That is to say that the single ampersand always evaluates both arguments whereas the double ampersand will only evaluate the second argument if the first argument is true.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>("||") is the “conditional logical OR” operator. These operators exhibit ways only if needed so. It is as well pretty much related to the ("&amp;&amp;").</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This sign here pretty much means not equal to.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Here is an example.</span>[/size]</span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This solidifies only the person who has the player rights 3 able to use the command. Nothing lesser than, or greater than is capable of using the command.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This is now changed so that anything equal to owner rights, or greater than owner rights now capable of using the command.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This is now changed so that anything equal to owner rights, or lesser than owner rights now capable of using the command.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Setting a command for a specific player.</span>[/size]</span><br>
First of all let me explain how to set a command for a specific player.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>Determines whether two String objects contain the same data, ignoring the case of the letters in the String.<br>
Meaning whether it contains capitals or not, it will still grab the correct whole texts within the brackets.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>playerName obviously determines the players username he whom created his account with.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>This is where you place the players username or whole text.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">[size=14pt]Here is an example.[/size]</span></span></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>As you see I have set the command to myself, showing both the command and whom it was set to.<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p>It’s very simple but most do not know the following of which I’ve stated. I’m also not entirely aware if this is the correct section for posting my little lesson. This tutorial can go on forever that’s why I made it related to player commands in order for you to get an idea of it when you come across it while developing your servers. Players are more than welcome to add on, or ask for anything else related to these case. Thank-you.[/center]</p>
