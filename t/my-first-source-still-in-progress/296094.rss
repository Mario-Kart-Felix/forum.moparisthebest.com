    <description>okay first off the credits... 50% to mod allstar!!!!  30% to the reaper x you rock guys 20% to me for adding commands and editing there work!  yes it was reapagescape v2... but reapagescape v2 is a allstarscape source sooo im giving credits to both of them :)

This is my first ever edited source, so it might suck. But anyway i added some customs, got a client of course haha.
I added a new home. Deleted 2 of the bugged shops added a few items in the shops. and alot more so first off lets check out some pics eh?
Also please no bad posts its my first time ever coding something bye myself. screeny time!!!!

this is gonna sound stupid... anyway the d claws over write the dds i was gonna fix it... but im to lazy haha and it only specs twice all the 4 wpec codes from google were errors. or didnt work.
