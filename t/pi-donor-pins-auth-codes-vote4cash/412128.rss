    <description>Hi guys,

I was wondering on how I can add these things into my server, and work.


[u][b]Donator Pins[/b][/u]
I want to make it to where whenever a Person Donates, They get a Code, (A completely Random code full of letters and numbers)  and then they have to go to the forums and Redeem the code to get there Donator Status &amp; Item?



[u][b]Authorization Codes[/b][/u]
I want to make it to where whenever someone types ::vote, it takes them to a webpage with my Voting Sites, then once they&#39;re done voting, they can click on SUBMIT, which will give them an ::auth (s4js8gs) or something, then when typed ingame, they recieve 25M cash and 15 PK Points?


[u][b]Vote4Cash[/b][/u]
This basically fits into Auth Codes, I already have this basically but it doesn&#39;t work, whenever a player types ::vote, then they vote on the page, and type ::claim ingame, it keeps saying &quot;You have already voted&quot; ?  This message gets alerted to everyone including myself...


Any help if appreciated, Thank you.</description>
