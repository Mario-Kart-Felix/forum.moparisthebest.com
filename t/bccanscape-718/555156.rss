    <description>Hello RSPS Community,

[size=12pt][font=arial black]I Would Like to say, BCCANSCAPE is finally back up and ready for action. I am looking for trustworthy, and reliable staff members currently, and I also work on the server daily. The only thing that is missing from this server is the most important thing. PLAYERS!!!!. So if you could all be so kind and come give Bccanscape a go. If it is not for you, feel free to leave a recommendation for me so I can make it better and more suitable for more people. Cheers to you who decide to give it a go, and a huge thank you to those of you who decide to stick around. Below are some details of what features are in server currently(only a few will be listed to keep element of surpise :)). Have a good day and I am looking forward to seeing everyone in game.
