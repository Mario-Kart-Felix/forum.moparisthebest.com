    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m looking to start up a server again, 24/7 hosted by myself and owner by myself, although i am looking for fully dedicated staff and a pair of coders whom also must be dedicated, 317, open to ideas, looking for 3 mods, 2 admins, 2 coders, 1 co owner and one web coder.

i am experienced within rs servers all the way back to 2006/2007, left the ordeal for about 16 months now im looking to get back in to it, seeing as things has changed over those 18 months i will need staff who know how things work now! i can code a little bit with 317 and up to 518, i can wed code anything you can think of, but i also need a web coder to cover me while i do other things!

I will be hosting the server and also hosting a website dedicated to the server and only to that, both server and web online twenty four hours a day 7 days a week, down time will be because of causes out of my control such as power outages and what not.

Reply to this thread or email me, email can be found through my profile. 

Thanks,
xSolution.</description>
