    <description>So this is my last attempt at getting help from this community, please don&#39;t let me down...

Okay so the current method of ISAAC ciphering in 317 private servers is messy to be honest. I would prefer not to implement it into my framework if I don&#39;t have to.

So what I wanted to know is can Java&#39;s SecureRandom from the java.security package be used instead. I know Rsdaemon has an implementation of SecureRandom working with the ugly ISAAC cipher generation class, but I want to use SecureRandom as a stand alone implementation.

I thought perhaps you could create a new instance of the SecureRandom, set the algorithm to ISAAC and generate a seed in which to make a server key.

Would this work? Are there any other ways of doing? All help is extremely appreciated.</description>
