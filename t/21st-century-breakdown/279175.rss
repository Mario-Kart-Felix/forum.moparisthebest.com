    <title>21st Century Breakdown</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/21st-century-breakdown/279175</link>
    <description>Was a major let down. Out of the whole lot, i only found two songs that were worth listening to.
The lyrics are also horrible. Forced rhyme after forced rhyme. I don&#39;t suggest you attain the new material legally.
However, it may grow on me.</description>
