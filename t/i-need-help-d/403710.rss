<p>All you have to do is define your shop (probably shops.cfg), then in the NpcActionHandler packet, add a case for your Npc, and tell it to open the shop.[/quote]</p>
<p>sounds more like he doesnt even have a regular -base- he has a blank its not delta pi or anything. that he is asking how to add shops from scratch how to code it in to tell the game what is a shop, not to simply  add it in shops.cfg spawnsfg and action handler , i could be wrong though</p>
