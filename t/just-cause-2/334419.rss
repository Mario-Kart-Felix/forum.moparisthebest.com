    <title>Just Cause 2</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-cause-2/334419</link>
    <description>Anyone else have it? I preordered it on a whim, and am amazed at how truly fun it is. It really came in under the radar, no real advertising, and it obviously wasn&#39;t pushed when it came to the release date. But that doesn&#39;t lessen the quality of the game. I&#39;ve clocked in about 44 hours since I got it Thursday, since I live in America I couldn&#39;t get the Limited Edition, but I did get one of the Limited Edition items cause I preordered. 

The map is HUGE, and just because it&#39;s super big, doesn&#39;t mean the quality of the visuals lacks at all. At 1080P the game looks amazing on the 360. I find myself roaming in the forests, drifting on the beaches, and climbing the dunes. It&#39;s almost too big, because it&#39;s so big, and it is set in a mostly rural countryside, navigating the vast expanses of the map is tricky. Flying is the fastest manual route, coming in second to being transported by chopper via the Black Market. It&#39;s much larger than GTA IV, and from my memory, is also larger than Mercenaries 2. 

There are many similarities, with GTA IV and Mercs 2, but that&#39;s a given when it comes to Sandbox games. But the similarities between them are done sooo much better in Just Cause 2. The aiming mechanics. show their roots in GTA IV, a simplistic geometric shape as a crosshair, and done from mostly third person. They&#39;re a bit strange, but once you get used to them it makes the gameplay flow so much smoother. 

The grappling hook was in the first Just Cause I do believe, but it&#39;s alot like the Mercs1&amp;2 grappling hook. The way this game does grappling though, just blows Mercs 1&amp;2 out of the water. The grappling hook is for more than jacking rides, it makes up your combat style, the way you navigate through areas. And just really speeds up walking distances. You can grapple to anything, and at anytime while you&#39;re grappling you can deploy a parachute, which allows you to go airborne. Once airborne, you can cover large distances while remaining in the air. 

It&#39;s very unrealistic, but also extremely fun. I&#39;ve spent a good 2 or 3 hours just flying from one destination to another with the parachute. Other ways the game is unrealistic, is the grappling hook itself. It can go for a good 10 - 20 meters away and pull you are 20kmh, all of this mounted on his forearm? Nope. 

I have some other gripes with it. The game has glitches, which hopefully will be patched soon. Voice overs are done in game, the game has cutscenes. But when on a mission you&#39;ll have a character speak to you, tell you your objectives, etc. Very often at the beginning of the speech, the first word will be repeated multiple times. Or when you&#39;re fighting, and you&#39;re standing behind an object at waist level, you won&#39;t fire, no matter how many times you pull the trigger. These are minor annoyance, and don&#39;t really hinder the gameplay. And will surely be patched soon.

Back to the positives though. Flying is awesome! I love getting in a huge 747, just barrel down the runway, and then go skydiving from as high as possible. There&#39;s a few types of planes, from Huge airliners, to small spy planes. Trick planes are crazy at low altitudes, and the large fighter planes look like something from Transformers. But they all get you where you need to go, faster than any other transportation.

Driving can be fun when you&#39;re on the road, going extremely fast in a spy car, or in an old muscle car. Or zooming past a rickshaw on a crotch rocket. The best by far is this Mustang type muscle car, that&#39;s been souped up. Has a turbo in it, racing seats, a wing. It looks pretty awesome, but man does it have some power. I&#39;m embarrased to say it, but on many many occasions. I yank it off the highway and up some cliff in the mountains, or over some dunes in the desert. Go mudding in the forests. It&#39;s genuine fun just riding around and racing through the beautiful scenery.

Now after speaking about everything else in the game. I should go over the campaign. It&#39;s pretty repetitive, but still entertaining. Go to this place. Listen to a repetitive, horribly acted cutscene. Take the given equipment. Get to this location. Complete objective, get rewarded with cash, and some [i]Chaos[/i]. Chaos is really just this meter of how much shit you blow up, or people you kill, etc. The more chaos you cause, the more missions you unlock, the more equipment you unlock, and really just gets you through the campaign. I&#39;m not very far into it, but where I am at, you have three factions(four really counting the Panay Government), The Roaches, Reapers, and the Ular Boys. All three are competing for control of the country. You help them to complete said missions, and in return you receive intel about a rogue agent, who just so happens to be your old mentor. You have to find out where he is, and capture/kill him. You eventually find him, and then the plot thickens. But I&#39;ll leave the rest for you to find out.

tl;dr

I love the game, and was worth the $59.99 USD I paid for it. I don&#39;t like buying new games, because I&#39;m afraid of paying that much, and not getting a quality game. But it was well placed here. Good campaign, Great environment, really interactive gameplay.</description>

The only thing that they did wrong on the second one versus the first one is that they took away safehouses where you could park your awesome vehicles. But the blackmarket upgrades and such are good.

              <p>Cowie` told me about it, I was considering getting it, maybe in a few weeks; might trade in AC2 or something like that to get it.  It’s funny you say the campaign was good, cause it got a 5 for story.  :rolleyes:</p>

              <p>Anyone else have it? I preordered it on a whim, and am amazed at how truly fun it is. It really came in under the radar, no real advertising, and it obviously wasn’t pushed when it came to the release date. But that doesn’t lessen the quality of the game. I’ve clocked in about 44 hours since I got it Thursday, since I live in America I couldn’t get the Limited Edition, but I did get one of the Limited Edition items cause I preordered.</p>
<p>The map is HUGE, and just because it’s super big, doesn’t mean the quality of the visuals lacks at all. At 1080P the game looks amazing on the 360. I find myself roaming in the forests, drifting on the beaches, and climbing the dunes. It’s almost too big, because it’s so big, and it is set in a mostly rural countryside, navigating the vast expanses of the map is tricky. Flying is the fastest manual route, coming in second to being transported by chopper via the Black Market. It’s much larger than GTA IV, and from my memory, is also larger than Mercenaries 2.</p>
<p>There are many similarities, with GTA IV and Mercs 2, but that’s a given when it comes to Sandbox games. But the similarities between them are done sooo much better in Just Cause 2. The aiming mechanics. show their roots in GTA IV, a simplistic geometric shape as a crosshair, and done from mostly third person. They’re a bit strange, but once you get used to them it makes the gameplay flow so much smoother.</p>
<p>The grappling hook was in the first Just Cause I do believe, but it’s alot like the Mercs1&amp;2 grappling hook. The way this game does grappling though, just blows Mercs 1&amp;2 out of the water. The grappling hook is for more than jacking rides, it makes up your combat style, the way you navigate through areas. And just really speeds up walking distances. You can grapple to anything, and at anytime while you’re grappling you can deploy a parachute, which allows you to go airborne. Once airborne, you can cover large distances while remaining in the air.</p>
<p>It’s very unrealistic, but also extremely fun. I’ve spent a good 2 or 3 hours just flying from one destination to another with the parachute. Other ways the game is unrealistic, is the grappling hook itself. It can go for a good 10 - 20 meters away and pull you are 20kmh, all of this mounted on his forearm? Nope.</p>
<p>I have some other gripes with it. The game has glitches, which hopefully will be patched soon. Voice overs are done in game, the game has cutscenes. But when on a mission you’ll have a character speak to you, tell you your objectives, etc. Very often at the beginning of the speech, the first word will be repeated multiple times. Or when you’re fighting, and you’re standing behind an object at waist level, you won’t fire, no matter how many times you pull the trigger. These are minor annoyance, and don’t really hinder the gameplay. And will surely be patched soon.</p>
<p>Back to the positives though. Flying is awesome! I love getting in a huge 747, just barrel down the runway, and then go skydiving from as high as possible. There’s a few types of planes, from Huge airliners, to small spy planes. Trick planes are crazy at low altitudes, and the large fighter planes look like something from Transformers. But they all get you where you need to go, faster than any other transportation.</p>
<p>Driving can be fun when you’re on the road, going extremely fast in a spy car, or in an old muscle car. Or zooming past a rickshaw on a crotch rocket. The best by far is this Mustang type muscle car, that’s been souped up. Has a turbo in it, racing seats, a wing. It looks pretty awesome, but man does it have some power. I’m embarrased to say it, but on many many occasions. I yank it off the highway and up some cliff in the mountains, or over some dunes in the desert. Go mudding in the forests. It’s genuine fun just riding around and racing through the beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>Now after speaking about everything else in the game. I should go over the campaign. It’s pretty repetitive, but still entertaining. Go to this place. Listen to a repetitive, horribly acted cutscene. Take the given equipment. Get to this location. Complete objective, get rewarded with cash, and some <span class="bbcode-i">Chaos</span>. Chaos is really just this meter of how much shit you blow up, or people you kill, etc. The more chaos you cause, the more missions you unlock, the more equipment you unlock, and really just gets you through the campaign. I’m not very far into it, but where I am at, you have three factions(four really counting the Panay Government), The Roaches, Reapers, and the Ular Boys. All three are competing for control of the country. You help them to complete said missions, and in return you receive intel about a rogue agent, who just so happens to be your old mentor. You have to find out where he is, and capture/kill him. You eventually find him, and then the plot thickens. But I’ll leave the rest for you to find out.</p>
<p>tl;dr</p>
<p>I love the game, and was worth the $59.99 USD I paid for it. I don’t like buying new games, because I’m afraid of paying that much, and not getting a quality game. But it was well placed here. Good campaign, Great environment, really interactive gameplay.</p>
