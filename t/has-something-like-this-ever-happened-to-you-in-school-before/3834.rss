 ok well I go to school. Theres cops everywhere and they say go to the lower fields. I look at the school. On the front theres theres words in green paint Saying: Hairomodia (Meaning still unknown) and then Bomb Bomb. So i go down to the fields and sit there for 3 hours baking in the sun and then we had to go take 2 finals. Got out at 3:10 And what else I figured out is that there was wierd symbols inside the school and the security camera were painted over.

Sorry for the crappy typing.</description>

              <p>Lol I’ve done so much funny shit, and never gotten in trouble. One time, my teacher had to run something to the office, I ran up to her desk, grabbed her coffee, ran outside, and pissed in it XD. When she came back in, drank a couple sips, and poured it out, ans said must be deCaf or something, we all laughed…</p>
<p>Also, I shit myself during the FCAT (Like SAT’s) on purpose, it was so fucking funny.</p>

              <p>well idk the worst thing that happened in my school, but the worst that happened to me was bad. Here it goes, and yes i know im wasting my time but im bored and high… Me and my friend started bombing in school for like 2 months straight. Then we started noticing kids throwing up there whack tags so we kept ragging over them… pretty soon it got so out of control announcments were made saying if the artists were ever cought you will be removed permaneltley and sent to jail. But i didnt listen and then one day i decided to hit up the biggest staircase in our school. At the time i wrote CRON. So i was doing my filly on the wall untill a kid comes up to me and says give me 20 bucks and i wont snitch and i said fuck you and walked away. (but you know what really pisses me off is when people always say snitching is gay and snithers should die and all that shit and look what this kid does.) He calls a hallway monitor over and says “look over there” pointing to my art and then he says “i know the kid who done this, quick hes upstairs in a red and blue shirt” when i heard this me and my freind ran, my friend ran inside the nurse later to get caught and then stupid of me not leaving school, i decided to walk into the lunch room where my shirt was grabbed from behind almost choking me. Mr.Battles was his name and said congradulations you just been giving a free ticket to jail. Got arrested on the spot, searched(they found 4 magnum markers, shoe polisher, and caps, and some art i did on paper), and put into the principles office. Cops asked me all this shit where i live etc etc, and he says we have been looking for, and i said what, he goes your the same CRON thats all over these walls outside. I didnt say anything but the super intendant came, principle, head of the school you name it. But the worst part was having every teacher in the school come up and looking at me saying this was the kid the whole time, but the worser part was that one of the teachers was my cousin witch wasnt good. Got kicked out of school for 5 days, had to attend community service but then bought back to school after court and a hearing because my grades were so good and thats the first time i ever been suspended.<br>
I was fined a total of 4000 something dollars, my mom beat the shit out of me, my dad said “why couldnt you paint downstairs in the basement walls?”… but i got some respect in school cause of all the ups i got hitting that big staircase.<br>
and i still cant find that kid that snitched on me.<br>

<p>Lol, nothing exciting ever happens in my school, except for a few fights, but not big ones, and they usually don’t last long cause the teachers are good at breaking them up. One of my teachers is like Mr. Buff.</p>

              <p>My school’s pretty new. It has camera’s on every hall way, up and down stairs. Camera’s outside. Big metal fences. motion censors in ever room and sucurity in the school all night and day. So theres not much of a chance to do things like that and get away with it. Plus you get fined about Â£200 ($400 roughly) for setting off a fire alarm as a prank becuase the fire brigade get called out automaticaly.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago on the last Monday of school some seniors came in, superglued nails pointed side up on all the benches. They painted this electrical box, which used to be green, blue. Now all the Green-Box-Kids are pissed. They put birdseed EVERYWHERE in almost every building. The cameras were all pointing up, but I only heard about that part.[/quote]</p>
