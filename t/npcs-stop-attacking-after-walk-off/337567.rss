    <title>Npc&#39;s stop attacking after walk off?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-stop-attacking-after-walk-off/337567</link>
    <description>hello, i decided (yeah its not that good) to use delta for a wile to get some stuff going then upgrade it to hyperion in the near future but any ways wile im on delta i have got a source and i cant figgure out how to the npc&#39;s to stop attacking/following after you attack them. I dont want every monster to do it though like aggressive monsters i want them to follow you until you get a certain distance but like men and guards folow you untill they are off the map and thats kinda gay because they are still trying to attack you when you come back (thay are still like folowing you on the spot). so if any one has a fix please comment.
Thanks  -TaYlOr-</description>
