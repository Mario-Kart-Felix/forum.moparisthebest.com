    <title>Project MTP - Team And Testers Needed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-mtp-team-and-testers-needed/354005</link>
    <description>Hey everyone

Im here with the new project im working on, MTP
MTP is a pking server. It is based in edge and all of the wildy
There is very good shops, one even for skilling because some people do not like constant pking and like to skill.
Here are just some random pictures

MTP is based on project insanity. I am just learning to use it because it isnt basic delta :P

I am currently coding and hosting 24/7

If you are interested in coding, leave a comment saying what you can code on Project Insanity base and why you would be a good person for the Job.

I do need someone to make a webclient, otherwise I will do it when i get some time.


If you are interested in just playing the server and being a tester, than Private message me and I will send you the client link. I do not want to advertise on here unless a Mod approves I can.</description>

              <p>Hellio, my name is Jonah, I would love to be a coder or admin in your server.<br>
I have been the Owner, Co owner, and Admins of over 20 servers in 2 years. 5 of which have been very successful.<br>
I have C++ experience, client creation experience, and I am very good with people.<br>
I am a great worker, and I am currently in highschool, so I can play most afternoons and nights ( I stay up late), and I think I would be a great help to this server. If you are interested in having me as a part of your server, private message me on here… - Thanks again, — Jonah</p>

              <p>My name is Carlos your server looks intriguing so I wanna help.</p>
<p>Ive been coding ever since I got a laptop even before that on my little sisters CPU.<br>
I stopped my server scripting  when I realize I needed to get into a Good College (Etc…)<br>
So I stopped for a while and Hit the books… (But they hit me back :P)</p>
<p>So anyway I think I am gonna be pretty useful in this server. Well, I’m good at Coding, And getting the server popular (People say my writing captures them or something…).<br>
Please reply from: Carlos  ;D</p>

<p>Good question. I never really thought of that before but I probably should use 474+ npcs</p>
