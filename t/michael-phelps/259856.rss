    <description>http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/news/150832/14-times-Olympic-gold-medal-winner-Michael-Phelps-caught-with-bong-cannabis-pipe.html


Well, it looks like Shaun White isn&#39;t the only Olympic athlete who indulges in herbal remedies. Does this mean that Phelps won&#39;t be appearing in any more [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R228MSqhm8]goofy commercials[/url]? Will he lose his corporate sponsors? Unlikely. Shaun White was outed as a pothead yet his career does not appear to have suffered a dramatic downturn.

It has always been a difficult problem for government programs like &quot;[url=http://www.abovetheinfluence.com/]Above the Influence[/url] to condemn potheads as losers and the herb itself as something dangerous and evil, when so many successful and brilliant individuals are casual tokers. Phelps has been lionized by a media intent on promoting the great American meritocracy, the same media which pointless propagates the marijuana myth. Is the day coming when weed will be legalized? Only if Phelps and other smokers in the spotlight actually stand up for their rights.</description>

Judging by the pictures of him, I’d say he’s far from an athlete. That’s fine, it’s not my place to decide, he’s obviously a person who excells in the technology world, as Phelps excells in cutting the 50 metre pool in record times.

Travis is an exceptionally overweight male, judging by his hobbies and the state of his being one would only assume that he is indeed, not an athlete.</p>

<p>Heroine is one of the worst drugs I can think of, once you’re addicted to heroine you can’t get out. If you try to stop you’ll end up killing yourself from not smoking heroin, or if you’re addicted you’ll die smoking it. Weed can be a one time thing or an addiction.<br>

Probably the exact same thing, weed is considered to be as bad as heroin.</p>

<p>Yes, I like to drink and have fun.</p>
<p>Greedy oil companies? Seriously?[/quote]</p>
<p>Yep. It’s more over paper though. DuPont is the oil company I am talking about, who also owned the patent for paper from trees (and also owned a large amount of land that was full of timber). This was in the 30’s and marijuana can make 4 times more paper in the same amount of area of trees. It could also make plastic effectively, and dupont had patents for plastic from oil. It could also make durable clothes, rope, etc. Dupont had patents for nylon. DuPont couldn’t be making billions of dollars a year if they didn’t ban marijuana. Duponts chief financial backer had a nephew who was the head of the Bureau of Narcotics. They worked together to put out a lot of propaganda, with no research at all. Videos were made like reefer madness, showing that if you smoke marijuana you will go completely insane and kill yourself and your loved ones possibly. They also said it’s because niggers and mexicans smoke it, but thats another story.</p>
<p>It has gotten such a stigma attached now. Imo, theres no reason to drink alcohol, and think against others who smoke pot. Alcohol causes a lot more damage. The only thing smoking has on it, is the fact that your smoking and smoking anything can’t be good. But you can use a vaporizer or consume it orally. I’d also like to mention that it kills aging and mutating cells and prevents cancer.</p>
<p>You can find better sites with more info, but here’s some good pages to read.</p>

<p>You know why when you drink, you get drunk? Because if you got high from the alcohol, you would be doing drugs!! But drunk is just another word for being high on something.</p>
