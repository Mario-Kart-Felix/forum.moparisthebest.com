    <title>Runescape.jar differs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-jar-differs/216055</link>
    <description>It appears the class files defined in the loader started applet differ from those in runescape.jar from the website. I have only looked at client.class but the only difference seems to be the lack of debug information such as line numbers and the source file&#39;s name in the website based one.

This could difference could be used through the Exception stack trace.

Didn&#39;t get all of the classes to load so I could only compare some of them. Still 95% are the same except for the lack of the debug information.</description>

              <p>Line numbers are part of the stack trace. These line numbers have been removed so in the stack trace you get unknown source or similar. In the class files defined with the loader however these line numbers are included.</p>

and when you are talking about the debug information, do you mean their stack trace generation?</p>
<p>excuse me for being daft, but your post is largly incoherent</p>
