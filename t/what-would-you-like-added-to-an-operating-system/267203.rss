    <title>What would you like added to an operating system?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-you-like-added-to-an-operating-system/267203</link>
    <description>I was installing COD4 today and when the serial/key came up, i had the key copied to clipboard like xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx and it wouldn&#39;t let me paste it, id have to do each xxxx part 1 by 1. Normally i woulden&#39;t think of anything id like in a new operating system, but id like built in clipboard that holds more than 1 value.

Something like ctrl + C copies something to clipboard, when new text is copied, it moves the last clipboard text back a position, to paste you could use ctrl + f1. That would paste the newest value added, f2 would to the one before, f3 the one before that etc. Probably a max of 5 values would be nice, i know an application can do this but id rather not have a 3rd party application running when it could be integrated into a newer windows or something.

so What ideas have you came up that would be useful and is currently not in any operating systems?</description>

Yes, but the idea is good, you can use it to other things too.</p>
<p>I would add a way to install a program, there all files are saved in one map of your chose, and then i mean, user files, registry and all other things the program may install</p>

yeah and so do other companies aswell, CS4 let me so i guess Adobe would have that in all their products<br>
but as for features in OS’? I dont really want an individual feature, i want apps to do the features the OS just needs to be able to provide a stable platform for running apps, browsing files and the like.</p>

              <p>I was installing COD4 today and when the serial/key came up, i had the key copied to clipboard like xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx and it wouldn’t let me paste it, id have to do each xxxx part 1 by 1. Normally i woulden’t think of anything id like in a new operating system, but id like built in clipboard that holds more than 1 value.</p>
<p>Something like ctrl + C copies something to clipboard, when new text is copied, it moves the last clipboard text back a position, to paste you could use ctrl + f1. That would paste the newest value added, f2 would to the one before, f3 the one before that etc. Probably a max of 5 values would be nice, i know an application can do this but id rather not have a 3rd party application running when it could be integrated into a newer windows or something.</p>
<p>so What ideas have you came up that would be useful and is currently not in any operating systems?</p>
