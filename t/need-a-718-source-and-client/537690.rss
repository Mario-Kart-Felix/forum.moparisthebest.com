    <title>Need A 718 Source and Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-a-718-source-and-client/537690</link>
    <description>Hello people, I have been looking everywhere for a decent 718 source. I couldn&#39;t find any. Don&#39;t think that i looked for 10 minutes than gave up. I went through 30 pages of server downloads and if a good looking one came up, the dl links were broken. All i want is one with grand exchange. Thank You!</description>
