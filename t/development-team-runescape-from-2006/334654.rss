    <description>Looking for another coder and a host for a new server me and a good friend gh0stfang are starting.

We haven&#39;t decided upon a name, nor have we chosen a base.
Me and Gh0stfang have been working on a project named Left4Quake, a PSP emulation of left4dead based upon quake. Gh0st is an epic modeler, and I am a certified web developer with experience back in the day coding with servers like jorsascape before it was taken over by ladybug and consequentially leeched by pimp.

We plan on making a full, amazing recreation of runescape with slightly higher xp rate and great economy. 
Like I said, Gh0st is an amazing modeler and we plan to use his skills with custom items and npc&#39;s.


If you&#39;re interested, email me at Koolvin@left4quake.com or text me at 503-662-2565</description>
