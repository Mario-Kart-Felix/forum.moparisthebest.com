    <title>(an unorganized stream-of-consciousness) on this site</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-unorganized-stream-of-consciousness-on-this-site/384071</link>
    <description>the scene is axually pretty much dead as of now, minus little cliques following rsbot-spinoffs, and i think it opens up a perfect opportunity to seize control and try and centralize runescape cheating at moparisthebest.

the only problem is that we need something unique to stimulate the cheating community at large to take action and reinvigorate the forums. projects created by the &quot;elite&quot; member groups (CMs, CCs, Vets) would probably do best, while allowing the public to subscribe to occassional releases etc. this makes sense as it really is the &quot;elite&quot;&#39;s duty to progress and keep moparisthebest as an integral part of the scene, just as it is the people&#39;s duty to keep a nation powerful. now to the objective of this thread; this should act as a sort of initiative to start using the boards as a breeding ground for brainstorming ideas for practical projects that we can reasonably do in a few months maximum to reinforce the site&#39;s standing in the cheating scene. no special formats for these ideas, just they should keep it civil and rational, and therefore follow any other rules on posts. i think a few projects we could work on could be a reliable deobfuscator or decompiler, jagex-format codecs, etc -- generally the kind of tools moparisthebest is willing to fund.

i think the main problem with the current attempt to stimulate the cheating scene is that it almost directly targets moparscape and private servers, which aren&#39;t &quot;causes&quot; that most people feel comfortable to be working for. it has a good motive, money, but because of viral anti-social segregationist and elitist thought, most find it demeaning to work for moparscape. i think one of the main reasons for this rift is the fact that the communities are separated fundamentally at their core; it is for this reason i think that moparscape and moparisthebest should be once-again reunited under a common umbrella.

this reorganization should also encompass a more logical structuring of the forums. as they should be, suggestions on how to reformat this forum should also be encouraged.

thoughts on the plan? ideas to incorporate? post them here.</description>

<p>I’d say there’s more benefit for personal intellectual challenge though. More time to explore etc rather than the intenseness because of loosing money.</p>

<p>Obviously I would split fields into types, and total counts,<br>
Method return types, parameters etc etc. so it would come to about 15 or so different metrics</p>

I’m happy with the way it works now - it could be done much more ‘correctly’ - but it works better than it needs to already. If I had the time I’d work on it more but pretty busy at the moment. When i get a chance I’ll upload it and someone else can try to work on it (although its more a proof of concept, and a rewrite would be better - since I figured it out as I went, its not done elegantly).</p>
