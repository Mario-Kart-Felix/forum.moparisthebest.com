    <title>Online fire cracker store?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/online-fire-cracker-store/1225</link>
    <description>Hey, well first of all I am obbsessed with fire and firecrackers, etc..

I used to make my own by stealing some crap from school but they sometimes explode in your hand while making them, and sometimes they backfire and it&#39;s just not safe, plus I think they caught on and are now locking the chemicals up and stuff. Summer is on the way and I need some firecrackers :D 

About 20 minutes away from me there is a hillbilly/redneck town that sells them cheap, but they suck ass. The bang and the power of them isnt bad, but the second the fire hits the wick, they explode immediatly. In florida I bought these mighty mice firecrackers, they were nice. You could put them underwater and they would still explode, plus you had over 2 seconds to get away from them, thus making it easier to throw in your grumpy neighbors garden. 

Problem is, I&#39;m in Canada. Firecrackers are illegal here(most of them), yet normal fireworks are not? I have been looking for some online stores that will deliever them, but I have only found large fireworks that are exspensive. What I really want are just tiny crackers with a lot of power and noise and good enough fuses so that you can actually throw them, but are still legal. Is there any popular online store to buy firecrackers that ship to Canada? I tried ebay.ca(For canadian reasons) and they only had clothes when I typed in fire crackers.  Google wasn&#39;t much help either, found some other expsenive sites and I dont know if they are scams or not.</description>

<p>As you know I used to be in Canada as well. In Toronto if you go Downtown you'll see Little China. These Chinese people have EVERYTHING at insane hacked off prices. I bought a 1 GB Ram over there for 20 Dollars and it was completely functional (although he didn't give me a warranty). Rumor is that they sell Firecrackers as well.</p>

              <p>Hehe, thanks I'll take a look.</p>

<p>I've been reading hundreds of pages on rotteneggs.com and found some neat guides for safer ways of making them homemade. Sonic booms have enough in them to make something just as powerful as an m-80 <img src="//forum.moparisthebest.mopar/images/emoji/emoji_one/smiley.png?v=3" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> And their are roman candles out there that can also be used, this is gonna be great im gonna stock up so many.</p>
