    <description>Hello there.

How can the ISAAC Cipher be used to encrypt data? (such as opcodes)

I believe I understand the basic idea, as in during the login block the server sends the client the server session key (generated with ISAAC) that will be used to decrypt/encrypt the opcodes, but how is this put into practice? Is the key simply added to the data that needs encryption? 

Thank you.</description>
