    <description>i was wondering if it is possible to make a command that makes everyone online open to a specific website

for example if i were to do &quot;::open www.moparisthebest.com/smf&quot; when i was online, everyones browser that is online would open up to that website?</description>

he even said in the title he is using delta…</p>
<p>well im not sure, i guess that would be kind of like a command were you type and it forces ppl to do a certain emote, gfx, and say a certain thing, kind of like a force command, anyways, the closest i can direct you to this is:<br>
make a button on your gui that redirects you to your desired website<br>
setup an anno timer telling you what to do every certain amount of time you set<br>
