    <title>Best method for...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-method-for/447025</link>
    <description>What is the best current method (or exploit) into obtaining WPA keys from wireless networks, I have tried using airocrack-ng however against WPA it is quite useless as it would take 805 days to look through all possible 8 character A-Z combinations.

I have looked into exploiting WPS by spamming the pin numbers using reaver however routers block the attack, firmware is now pushed to devices automatically so they are all frequently unto date.

Now I have started looking into pyrit to go back to the airocrack-ng method of cracking the handshake message but using multiple cores and my GPU at the same time.

What exploits and tools would you advise me to research into?</description>

              <p>Ahahaha.  This is funny;  just a week ago I was on vacation with no internet and used my time in a local library finding out a way to do it, and I was able to crack a successful WPA2 pin with Reaver.</p>
<p>I don’t know an alternative, but what I do know is that every 10th pin or so, they would block WPS access for about 5-10 minutes, but I kept it going for a while and finally got it within 62 hours.</p>
<p>I reached 96% of all possible combinations before reaching the pin, which is EXTREMELY unlucky.  You’re bound to get yours within the first 50% almost guaranteed.</p>
<p>For reference I was using my old laptop with two cores and 1.8ghz.  Good luck to you.</p>
