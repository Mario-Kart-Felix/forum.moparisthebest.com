    <title>If marijuana were to be legalized, would the price fall sharply?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-marijuana-were-to-be-legalized-would-the-price-fall-sharply/315108</link>
    <description>I was thinking - If marijuana was to be legalized, wouldn&#39;t the price go way down?

I&#39;m not sure whats harder to grow - tobacco or marijuana.
Average tobacco is about 20$ a pound. A pound. 
Do you guys think the price would fall a lot because of competition/legalization, like to 1$ a gram?</description>

              <p>I do see a possibility where the price would fall.  Drug traffickers would still want a part of the profit on weed, I could see them charging competitively with legal dealers.  They could lower prices as much as they want, as opposed to the legal retailers who have to make their prices accommodate federal law.  If we saw a price drop, it would be from the traffickers who do not want to lose their profit.</p>

</aside>
<p>Tobacco is by far harder to grow than marijuana.  I’ve never grown either, but I know that marijuana used to grow around where I live naturally when the Indians lived here from history books.  (the Indians were ran out of Ohio by the Americans around 1815 or so)  So I would say that it will never be legalized because of the sheer fact that anyone can grow it easily and it therefore couldn’t be taxed by the government.</p>

              <p>Uriko is right, the only reason it would be legalized is for the government to make money.  Cut out the national debt, you know?  So yeah it would be taxed heavily.</p>

              <p>I was thinking - If marijuana was to be legalized, wouldn’t the price go way down?</p>
<p>I’m not sure whats harder to grow - tobacco or marijuana.<br>
Average tobacco is about 20$ a pound. A pound.<br>
Do you guys think the price would fall a lot because of competition/legalization, like to 1$ a gram?</p>
