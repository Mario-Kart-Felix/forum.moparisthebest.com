<p>Alot of people say this, how?[/quote]It’s just… bland. They’ve gotten better at quest ideas to where it actually follows a story and there’s quests that stray from the normal “kill this, gather this”; but at end-game it now has even more of a repetitive feel to it than ever to me. There’s only TWO instances to do for the top heroic gear now, both being troll-based.</p>

They tried to make it more like Vanilla but they failed. People hyped Cata up too much so when it was released it was disappointing. Also they stuffed a lot of classes and roles around. All in all they just made the playing experience boring, maybe if they did some things different it could of turned out better.</p>

<p>I’m finding it less and less enjoyable, myself. I’m playing RIFT and awaiting Trion World’s Defiance to hopefully make me content once again.</p>

shitty but still pretty fun. I dont no life it but I enjoy raids and pvp and thats about it. I mainly play it to immerse myself in the world, alot of inspiration for their art.<br>
[/quote]Immersiveness and arcade gameplay doesn’t really match up very well when nearly everything is static and predictable.[/quote]<br>
Everything is predictable, by immerse I meant the game world and technology are so unique that its gives you a backstory and helps me create art.</p>

<p>I bought one month membership and honestly it was the worst game I have played that I had to pay for, it’s just repetitive tasks and quests over and over and the graphics aren’t high enough to make that remotely enjoyable.</p>

<p>THIS is how it was when I played on a private server, because it took forever for bgs to start and dunegons didnt work. I switched to retail for cataclysm and I only had to do quests up to 15, the rest was dungeons and pvp which I get a kick out of. Sadly I would like to ditch WoW for a better mmorpg I could spend time on, but I haven’t found any able to fill that void.</p>
<p>By the way, anyone looking for a good private server check out my video for bloodcraft, full guide in the description on how to play:<br>

I was never interested in the game, I thought it seemed so complex with all the spells, the player’s buttons etc., but I don’t know, suppose I could get the free trial an attempt.<br>
[/quote]It’s a button-mashfest. Nothing really complex about it, just a lot to keep track of.[/quote]<br>
