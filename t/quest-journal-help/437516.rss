    <title>Quest Journal help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quest-journal-help/437516</link>
    <description>I have something of a issue within my quest journal. Unlike most others, mine does not have the scroll bar. There are 5 quests highlighted, and no matter how many more I have put in, they do not appear past the point of doing them. When I finish one, it goes green as it should, but when I log off and back on, the quest is done, though it shows it being done in character pages, etc. 

Guess the question is, is the quest Journal dealt with in the client side? If so, does anyone know where to get a de-compiler. Who ever had this server before me, removed the editable pages from the client. So atm, I cannot do anything on that side. 

If the Quest Journal is on the server side, can someone point me in the right direction? I know where everything is to make the quests appear, (texthandler, client, clickingmost, etc) just not how to make is scroll, and make the quests stay permanently.
Thanks :D</description>

<p>The scrollbar is determined via the interface cache. Use lin’s interface editor and edit interface 638 to incorporate a scrollbar.</p>
