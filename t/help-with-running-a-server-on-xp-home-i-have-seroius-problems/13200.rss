    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-running-a-server-on-xp-home-i-have-seroius-problems/13200</link>
    <description>Well here is my problem... I am useing project 16 4.5 and this is my problem...

When I start my server and when about 12 to 13 people log in it wont let anymore people get on... It just says error connecting to server.... I have set the max connections in the server.Java to 2000 and still nothing... I am thinking that it is xp home.... I have heard that xp home is limited to its server capability... Do I Need to upgrade to professional or is there some reg hack to allow more connections... Please help thanks!!

I am also useing broadband if that helps...
