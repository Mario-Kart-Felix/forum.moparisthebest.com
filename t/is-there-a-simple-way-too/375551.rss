    <description>**Changed my Question LOL*

OK. Since my other couldn&#39;t be answered I have another. Can anyone answer this. Why doesn&#39;t my Weapon Animation fully go through. This isn&#39;t rare it&#39;s like 70/30 it shows animation, the bad percentage shows him only blocking, is there anyway I can make it show my animation more fully? It still shows the hit, but it look like he hit while blocking...Any suggestions?</description>

              <p>Oh ok preciate it. Well I was heavily involved in servers, mainly playing them, but of course i took priority in my school work so I just stopped all together, and i just got done with my first semester of college, and I am rediscovering my love for java and RSPS. So hopefully you may see some decent work in the near future.</p>
