    <title>Npc attack all players [PI]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-attack-all-players-pi/368324</link>
    <description>I need somebody to write this for me, its very confusing for my brain. Basically boss npcs on my server (such as kbd, kq) only attack one player and when they attempt to attack another player their attacks are interrupted by the player attacking it, therefor it doesn&#39;t get to attack the other player and is just attacking one person the whole time really.

I want it to be like runescape where the npc turns around and attacks most of the players at least once, heres an example of what I want, watch the first 35 seconds of this video:
