[size=24pt]ABOUT:[/size]

Revision: 317 Loading 474. 474 Gameframe.
Client Type: Project Insanity
[size=14pt]What is &quot;Project Amazed&quot;?:[/size]
We are a professional well thought out rsps, this isn&#39;t your ordinary leeched server. We think out, or we get player feedback on about our future updates/ website updates. We actually listen to our players. I started this as my first coded and i rewrote a whole bunch. Many people lost the point of what a rsps is. It is suppose to be better and is suppose to be easier to level. But many people add what they want which is fine to be, but it doesn&#39;t fit. Like 317 loading 614... We are here to stabilize that.

[size=14pt]The Team:[/size]
Our system is way different than most of any others. I actually decided to snatch an steal some ideas off of Froyscape. Credits to Arham 4. For some of this.

[size=14pt]Pandan:[/size]

[size=14pt]Matsa:[/size]

[size=10pt]What are they:[/size]

Skills:
Not going to go to deep.

Firemaking: Works but a bug.
Fishing: No emote while fishing.
Agility: Don&#39;t know how to code this.
Slayer: Still nothing.

Media:
Soon to come, i fixed my laptop from a problem and a lot of the memory was lost, so now it is good, but i lost the files. I tried to download it but uppit.com is down. So i can&#39;t really get pictures.

[size=18pt]Closing the Thread:[/size]
I hope i get lots of players if i decide to put it online which is a 80% chance i well.

<p>Work on your banner, grammar, server name, and your java knowledge. Not being mean or anything just saying this doesn’t look like it will succeed. If i’m wrong, good luck…</p>
