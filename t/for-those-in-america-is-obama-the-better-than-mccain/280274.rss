Obama is the <span class="bbcode-b">[u]Anti-Christ</span>.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Don’t be a fool. I am sick of people saying this. If any of you guys would know the first thing about the anti-Christ, you would know he will rise to power in the <span class="bbcode-b">west</span>.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@topic</span>: besides that, I hate these topics because everyone who posts in them are ignorant little youngsters. Everyone who posted before me excluding maybe 3 is totally ignorant and is adamant in their parent’s and friend’s beliefs, not their own. Don’t give an opinion on politics unless it is entirely your own, and you will back it up to the death.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree with you to an extent.</p>
<p>First of, my I want to make my point clear. <span class="bbcode-b">I do NOT believe Obama to be the Anti-Christ. Topics like these are annoying and immature.</span></p>
<p>I’d just like to take apart a few of your points to and give you my opinion to perhaps let you see a few things.</p>
<blockquote>You would know he will rise to power in the [b]west[/b]</blockquote>
<p>Jesus was in the middle east, his followers most likely recorded the findings and information about the <span class="bbcode-b">Anti-Christ</span> inside the middle east. America can be considered to west because a lot of Europe and the Middle East consider America to be to the <span class="bbcode-b">west.</span> Which is why it’s easily misunderstood.</p>
<blockquote>Everyone who posted before me excluding maybe 3 is totally ignorant and is adamant in their parent's and friend's beliefs</blockquote>
<p>You’re right there. However mostly everyone carries some various opinions and beliefs from their parents. Most likely you as well. Not saying you’re wrong or anything.</p>
<blockquote>Don't give an opinion on politics unless it is entirely your own, and you will back it up to the death.</blockquote>
<p>“<span class="bbcode-b">and you will back it up to the death</span>”</p>
<p>I don’t know about that. Throughout life people change their point of views they might <span class="bbcode-i">fight for their beliefs until death</span> at one time, then another they wouldn’t feel the same. People’s views changes based on their experiences. I will fight for my beliefs within reason with an open mind, ignorance free.</p>
<p>I agree with a lot of what you say around these forums. I’ve been here since 2006 and I know how incredibly annoying these forums have become. I just hope you know that I was <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">not</span></span> in any way flaming you for your opinions. I wasn’t trying to make you sound stupid either. I was simply tearing down your words and giving <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">my</span></span> opinions based on my perspective.</p>
<p>As for the topic itself. I highly disagree to the point of Obama being the <span class="bbcode-b">Anti-Christ.</span> He is simply an over rated president spun in by popularity and fame.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 03, 2009, 01:55:43 am[/size][hr]Targeted at the actual thread:</p>
<p>Obama and McCain aren’t any good. The presidential election was mostly always screwed up. The presidential elections this country used to do were different then now. Back then, it was more about expression and being patriotic. The presidential candidates actually cared about the Americans and had decent ideas to steer the country. However, now a days the presidential elections are more about who can scoop up what dirt on which person. It’s about winning, promise anything you can and win at all costs. Which is why this country is so <span class="bbcode-b">immature.</span></p>
<p>I believe this quote is good for this situation.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">When the power of love overcomes the love of power, only then will this world know peace.</span></span></p>
<p>[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 03, 2009, 02:04:30 am[/size][hr]Other Points:</p>
<p>Obama:</p>
<p>I really believe he has some good ideas.</p>
<p>However the fact that he’s for abortion is where I draw the line. It’s such a controversial subject. But still, I believe it’s wrong and no matter the circumstances it should be prevented. My parents are for it as well which is why we argue about it.</p>
<p>He doesn’t keep a lot of his promises. Although, you have to realize that a lot of presidents were that way.</p>
<p>And still, no matter what any president does, America will never be content.</p>
<p>McCain:</p>
<p>I honestly never cared for the man. His views are okay and I would definitely consider voting for him. However, I disagree with how he discussed running the country. I disagreed with a lot of his <span class="bbcode-b">trash talk</span> about Obama. Like I’ve said, presidential elections are nothing but trash talk and it’s immature.</p>
<p>His age could of affected a lot of things. I really don’t like Sarah Palin. His age could of possibly affected his presidency. If he would have gotten ill or died, we would have been stuck with Palin, which I really don’t think is ready to run a country.</p>
<p>All in all, I disagree with a lot of the candidates of the election. I also don’t favor any of them because in my eyes they are all a little too immature. I’ve seen high school leveled kids act more mature and more sophisticated then some of the candidates.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how the fame of being the president tweaks minds.</p>

              <p>Truthfully,  I never liked Obama, and probably never will.  His views are completely against mine, he’s against the war in Iraq, etc.  He has not done one thing he said he would (thank God…), and he will probably end up like every other politician.  Nothing more than an icon who takes orders from some other guy that no one knows about.</p>
