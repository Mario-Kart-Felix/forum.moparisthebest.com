    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-npcs-to-face-you-examining-them/552568</link>
    <description>Hello again :)

So I&#39;ve been making progress with different parts of the EasyRSC source I&#39;m working on, but there&#39;s two things remaining which I&#39;m not having success with.

1) Which file should I be looking at to ensure that when I talk with an npc, they and I turn to face each other?
2) I&#39;ve been altering the examine text for npcs, mostly just to clear spelling errors; but sometimes I&#39;m coming across npcs in-game and when I right click and examine them, the description doesn&#39;t appear in the text line, nothing happens.  Which file looks after this?

Many thanks for any help with these.</description>

<p>Check out the wait times on the handlers for npc talk events.</p>
<p>As far as the moving faster well the game engine fires off every 600 ms to send all the packets per client and considering this is a local env it seems faster because your ping is incredible because the client and server are on the same ip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry once you start having ping and more players it will not seem as “fast”.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Hi again! Yes the npcs now turn to face me and I to them when I try to talk with them, hooray!</p>
<p>But I saw another problem when I was checking that out.  The descriptions I’ve been editing aren’t coming through.  So for example, I edited the examine text for a lvl 9 man to say ‘One of Runescape’s many citizens’ but when I examined a man just now, it brought up ‘one of runescapes many citizens’.  Any ideas?  The file I edited was EasyRSC\Server\conf\server\defs\NPCDef.xml.gz.  According to another guide on Moparscape you had to compile when you edited xmls so I did that just in case, but still no change.</p>

<p>Remember class files are compiled just compiled java you never touch .class files EVER.</p>

<p>So I’ve been making progress with different parts of the EasyRSC source I’m working on, but there’s two things remaining which I’m not having success with.</p>
<ol>
<li>Which file should I be looking at to ensure that when I talk with an npc, they and I turn to face each other?</li>
<li>I’ve been altering the examine text for npcs, mostly just to clear spelling errors; but sometimes I’m coming across npcs in-game and when I right click and examine them, the description doesn’t appear in the text line, nothing happens.  Which file looks after this?</li>
</ol>
<p>Many thanks for any help with these.[/quote]</p>
<p>It should be when the packet that sends the talktonpc i dunno what that is in the source.</p>
<p>But when the packet is sent add this code i just quickly took it from moparscape.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">						if (Formulae.getDirection(owner, affectedNpc) != -1) {
							affectedNpc.setSprite(Formulae.getDirection(owner,
									affectedNpc));
							owner.setSprite(Formulae.getDirection(affectedNpc,
									owner));
						}</code></pre>
<p>add this below to your formulae if it isnt in there.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">	public static int getDirection(Mob you, Mob them) {

		if (you.getX() == them.getX() + 1 &amp;&amp; you.getY() == them.getY() + 1) // bottom
			// left
			return 3;
		else if (you.getX() == them.getX() + 1 &amp;&amp; you.getY() == them.getY() - 1) // top
			// left
			return 1;
		else if (you.getX() == them.getX() - 1 &amp;&amp; you.getY() == them.getY() - 1) // right
			// up
			return 7;
		else if (you.getX() == them.getX() - 1 &amp;&amp; you.getY() == them.getY() + 1) // right/down
			return 5;
		else if (you.getX() == them.getX() - 1) // face right
			return 6;
		else if (you.getX() == them.getX() + 1) // face left
			return 2;
		else if (you.getY() == them.getY() + 1) // face down
			return 4;
		else if (you.getY() == them.getY() - 1) // face up
			return 0;

		return -1;
	}</code></pre>
<p>and you should be good.</p>
