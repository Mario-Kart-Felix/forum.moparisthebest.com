<p>Frankly if your going to put Aryan as your name of the bot you had better have the capacity to handle the fact that people think you are Nazis, only some educated people would know that it is simply to declare the superiority of the bot.</p>

<p>But at any rate, the main reason I did all of this spamming / flamming / critizism was to see how far I could go before getting banned (which I never was).

<p>If you do not enforce the rules for every single person, the rules will be ignored. Why follow the rules if no one else is? Not to mention that the rules arent set in stone. A moderator is a person who has been appointed due to their character, a certain amount of trust should be put in them to dictate what is suitable and what is not. Does the rules say I cant post a picture of a dead body? I guess I can do it – the moderators should make their own decision there to say it should NOT be allowed.</p>
<p>So to clairfy, I am not actually a neo nazi, I dont agree with hitler, I dont hate jews (oh and I dont hate you).</p>
<p>I do hope that this forum does go in a new direction, thou I do somewhat doubt it. Bad habbits are bad to break and it would require alot of effort from the administration team and to change the attitude of the users of this forum. It is possible thou.</p>
<p>Either way, this is my constructive criticism ignore it or not I dont care.[/quote]</p>
<p>You must have a lot of free time to make us belive you are a determined Jew Hating Nazi only too tell us you weren’t and only did it to show the exploitation of the rules…</p>

<p>[quote=“moparisthebest, post:10, topic:8596”]This is how it is going to work:</p>
<ol>
<li>I dont care what the picture is, if it is an offtopic picture in a post with no text or spam text, its getting deleted. Period.</li>
<li>If the picture contains images of people being hung, dead people, or pornography, it is getting removed because of the children that browse these forums.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than those two, plus common sense, you can post any pictures you want, just dont spam them.[/quote]</p>
<p>I dont know what text your post had in it, the above post is the new rule regarding pictures.</p>
<p>and why is she a g-mod over all boards? I dont know how much clearer I can be, she was the server dev board mod for longer than she has been a g-mod, it was quite a few months, so when we needed more moderators obviously she was the top choice, so she was given the position.</p>
<p>About the last comment Sean, real original, havent heard that one before :rolleyes: :P, all I am going to say to that is she lives in florida, I live in ohio, if your not familiar with the geography of the USA that is about a straight 24 hour drive @ 65mph</p>
