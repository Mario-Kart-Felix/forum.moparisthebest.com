    <title>[Showoff]Camaro Model: Year-End School Project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/showoff-camaro-model-year-end-school-project/398378</link>
    <description>Hey guys, just thought I would show you the outcome of my final-project as a 3D student in Highschool, so I figured I would end the year off by making a new Camaro, showing how much better I have gotten since the beginning of the year (when I was assigned a Camaro project). It goes without saying this one is much better. Hopefully this will inspire some of you beginner modelers.

Also: Excuse the quality of the scenery, it was made in 15 minutes

Very nice job, although it’s a little boxy, have you sub-surfed yet? Unless you’re going for that ps2 game look. I advise keeping that model and subsurfing, then baking a normal and texture map of the subsurfed version onto the old, low poly version.<br>
