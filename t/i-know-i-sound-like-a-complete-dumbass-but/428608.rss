    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-know-i-sound-like-a-complete-dumbass-but/428608</link>
    <description>I recently download a source which came with a client... When I click run.bat the .bat file comes up then closes quickly and no client shows. I think it has something to do with the cache though. I have the client&#39;s cache. I just need to know where to put it on my computer? Sorry, I know I sound stupid but it&#39;s been awhile since I have played with rsps&#39;s. Please help, it is greatly appreciated!</description>

<p>You put the cache in your :c drive</p>

</aside>
<p>That’s only for clients that have a cache downloader.</p>
<p>I’m happy you solved this.<br>
If you ever have a run.bat that does that right click it and press edit.<br>
at the bottom of the code there is usually the word exit.<br>
replace that with pause. the file won’t close again till you tell it to.</p>
