    <description>i was wondering if i could have my computer&#39;s i.p unblocked from moparscape forums..

it started when my brother used to play mopar and posted some rediculous questions and got my computer i.p banned (because they run of same i.p on our wireless) 

now to post/view i have to use a proxy and most of the time this laggs and its hard for me to post my tut (only got 2 so far)

thanks
