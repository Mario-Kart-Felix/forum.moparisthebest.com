    <title>Whip attack animation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whip-attack-animation/411032</link>
    <description>I&#39;m running an old Allstar-based server with the U-Rune client. As most of you know, in the time of those types of servers the whip looks weird when you attack with it. The animation seems to be correct, but the whip becomes disfigured in the air.

Any ideas on how I would go about fixing this so it attacked like it did in the 317 RS (or for you SoulSplit/PI people, it looks like that, but not the newer whip model)?

I can add pictures/video if you don&#39;t know what I mean.

Thanks for any help!</description>
