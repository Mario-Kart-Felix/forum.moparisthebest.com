    <title>[508] Tricky Customs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-tricky-customs/293177</link>
    <description>Im trying to add full PVP customs to my 508 client, which of course Im converting to 508 from a 317 custom.

So far Ive successfully added my morrigans&#39;, statius&#39;, and vesta&#39;s legs &amp; chest pieces, however when I add the head pieces it either makes the whole body disapear or makes the head do a bob moving backwards and forwards.

Can someone help please or atleast post the full pvp set that works for a 508 client =D

Thanks.</description>
