    <title>Clanbank?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clanbank/278662</link>
    <description>i need a clanbank were the clan can put items in and another one in the clan can take them out...

clanName = none is the default and if its clanName != none it has to search for the clanName in a file were the ints are stored... (like char bank) and print them onto screen so you can take them out (then it makes int -1 and adds the item)...

can someone help me make this because i have never done something like this before and would like it if you guys could give me snippets or tips....</description>
