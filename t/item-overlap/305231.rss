    <title>Item &quot;Overlap&quot;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/item-overlap/305231</link>
    <description>Okay, I coded in some new customs, one being a Halo 3 helm. Now it equips in the head slot, and works fine, except that if you look at it looking down, the cape and other armour goes on top of it. Is there any way to fix these 3d settings? (Happens with some weapons as well)

Any help appreciated,
