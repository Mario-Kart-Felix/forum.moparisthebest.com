              <p>Uncalled’s is too flatly coloured for my liking (duller reds + pinks + purples) with little wow, lacks depth and the botched text + the actual size of the thing is detrimental to my opinion of it. if the focal of the piece was meant to be the character then i wouldn’t know as i’m far too distracted by the obstructive and obnoxious fractal and the middle is just far too noisy in contrast to the overly calm + bland background. the smudging is nice behind but certain parts are too badly blurred whereas other parts are perhaps a little overly sharpened.</p>
<p>asshole_rule’s has nice complementary colours but the render is too blended in giving me the choice of too many focal points; my eyes seem to dart around everywhere because of the dual light sources and the left hand side’s yellowy bits. perhaps it’s just part of the effect but i’m not keen on the brightness on one side compared to the dullness of the other. also that little light-ray going up the guy’s arm just doesn’t seem like it should be there. depth is ok.</p>
<p>Rash’s was my vote because despite the colours being generally dark, the colours go extremely well with each other and the focal point is extremely clear to due to the enhancing of the colours (albeit the right-hand side is perhaps also a little overly enhanced and seems to much like part of the render). i love how the claw is sharpened, it steals the eye but not from the character. the lighting is well done and the depth is great in all respects, although the white light bit on the left seems unnecessary and a bit superfluous due to the colouring of it. also the random blue light above the render could do with a bit of removing as it seems misplaced. perhaps it could be lightened up just a notch too.</p>
<p>finally, why the fuck did kronixz_ even get a vote that is just … no…</p>

You want a section to grow, but you enforce the stupidest of rules.</p>

Uncalleds was more well rounded than both of yours, almost like the middle ground. Assholes was a bit too busy and the lights threw it off balance, yours was just a dark mass really.</p>
<p>I enforce stupid rules? Really? Then lets do normal SOTW, where we have one person picking the winner, no voting, no nothing. Is that less biased?</p>
<p>It was seriously 19 13 13 12, there was no reason not to include Uncalleds. Im thinking you guys are thinking I liked Uncalleds so I made up some phony exception just so he would win, thats not what happened. I was looking at the results to pm to cj and I said “what the hell ill throw Uncalleds in there also.”</p>

<p>That’s just sad.<br>
You want a section to grow, but you enforce the stupidest of rules.</p>
<p>Whatever, Assholes entry was the best. Mine was second best.<br>
Anybody with mediocre graphical  ability would be able to tell you that. I don’t even care if you think I sound like a tool.</p>

<p>I didn’t change it on vote day. I changed it 2-3 days into voting.</p>
<p>There was seriously a one point difference that put uncalled behind. Owell big woop we liked his the most AOOEHEE OH NOE WHATEVER suck it up.  Find a career where sigs are actually used and ill respect them more in the long run.</p>
<p>THIS IS WHY WE CANT HAVE NICE THINGS</p>
<p>But also go back to krack’s post, these were all so different. SOTW 2 is looking alot more promising because of the render.</p>

<p>This^^</p>
<p>The new competition is much better because you can really see who complimented/insulted the render. So hopefully having a new render every time will cut out the people trying to submit old stuff and also make choosing a winner easier.</p>
<p>And this is why there will be a few months wait before SOTW comes. Hopefully the section will be more active by then and we can have a real competition</p>

<p>Really confuses me.</p>
<p>Uncalled compo is really off, his has relatively no depth. His focal is too hidden amongst all of those effect. The smudging in the bg has really a  major negative effect, and brings the quality of the piece down. Lighting is non-existant.</p>
<p>That’s just a quick glance.</p>
<p>No offence to anyone, especially you or cj.<br>
But to really judge tags, you have to make them.</p>
