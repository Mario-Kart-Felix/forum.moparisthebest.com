    <title>317 Quest tab &quot;Players Online: &quot; + playerhandler</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-quest-tab-players-online-playerhandler/417930</link>
    <description>Ok, so basically my problem with the players online, is this:

The players (Number of players online) will not update on destruction (Logout) or Login, once you login and you see the players online, you will need to logout and log back in to see the amount of players online, or obviously use the ::player command.

Does anyone know this issue?

I checked the Destruct and Initialize methods, and I could not add anything to fix it.</description>
