    <title>I Need A Hoster</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-hoster/56994</link>
    <description>Hi,
Berlinscape has been on and off because my computer just isnt fast enough. But because i want to make it be on 24/7 (or something similar to that) i need a hoster for it. I know a lot about setting up your own webspace xampp ftp server etc. but dont know if there are actually any hosting services out there that host a small game like berlinscape/moparscape on their servers. Maybe someone could give me a suggestion to a site or maybe someone has a computer i could if use for berlinscape? 
Any replies will be higly appreciated and help on if i can host it somwhere else myself(like a webhost) WOULD BE AWESOME!
Berlinscape, which many users loved because of its features, can and will only put back up if i can host it somwhere. My laptop that im using now is to slow!
Thanks</description>
