    <title>I need a hoster</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-hoster/343909</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

Im really struggling to keep the server online for even 3 - 4 hours per day and its a popular server &quot;battlescape2000&quot; and users really hate when its offline so im looking for someone who has hosted servers before, that will be able to host this server.

Be careful: if you are already hosting a server, that you know how to host 2.. using different ports etc.

Thanks.

Tell me your msn and i will add you?

Thanks.</description>
