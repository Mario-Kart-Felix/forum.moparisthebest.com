    <description>i just jar&#39;d and signed my client compiled with jdk7 and my friend can&#39;t open it, is it because he needs the same version of java i created/compiled the client.jar with? if so.. is there any other way that i can make the client.jar so that all users can open it without having to download the same version of java that i compiled/created the client with?</description>
