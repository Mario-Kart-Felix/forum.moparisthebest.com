    <title>Help With Client Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-client-please/284743</link>
    <description>ok so i downloaded a client to use.

it was AgsPking client cause im using the source.

And im wondering how do i change the ip so people can log onto my server?

i seem to be able to but no one else can.

I changed the ip in the client file and egui.class file is a bunch of squares and stuff.

They cant seem to connect to my server.
i seem to be able to.

but i didnt have to changed anything to be able to connect to mine.

How do i edit so other people can use the client and connect to my server??? 

Please help thanks.</description>
