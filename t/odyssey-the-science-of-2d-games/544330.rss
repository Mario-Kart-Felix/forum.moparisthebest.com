    <title>Odyssey - The Science of 2D games</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/odyssey-the-science-of-2d-games/544330</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, and let me start off by saying that I am not a professional programmer, but I do aspire to advance my knowledge so long as I am able to comprehend the work at hand. I have always enjoyed development, and the first time I was introduced to programming was several years ago when RS2 private servers were booming, and although I was never good at it, I still somehow found a passion for it. Anyway, now since that&#39;s out of the way, let me get to the point of this thread. Essentially, I am preparing myself for further application of programming knowledge, so I figured I would develop a game along the way. This is where project [i]Odyssey [/i]comes in play. Odyssey, powered by Slick2D and LWJGL, will be the foundation for my future game projects, and will be a way for me to better understand many different methods in designed a 2D game with Java.


[u]Current features:[/u]

[ul][li]Basic entity structure[/li]
	[li]Music loading[/li][/ul]

Essentially, the current stage of this project only includes implementation of the Slick2D library; however, I will be updated this project as much as possible so that it will include more features to provide a foundation for any type of 2D game. If you would like to help out with this project, you are free to provide any feedback below, as suggestions are very much appreciated.

Oh no! It is well alive, and I have been working on it in my free time, I just haven’t updated the thread.

<p>Ahh goodluck, hope you finished this project. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
