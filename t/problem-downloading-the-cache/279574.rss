    <title>Problem Downloading the cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problem-downloading-the-cache/279574</link>
    <description>Hello. I am running Moparscape client 3.2 with Aryan, and have a problem when downloading the cache. I have run this client on this computer before, without problems, but since then I have formatted my drives due to viruses, and other errors. The client&#39;s console says the following before the error.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Downloading the 16mb cache file just once, please be patient.
Downloading c:/windows/.mpr_file_store_32/cache.zip...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I am running Java 6 SE Update 13, (build 1.6.0_13-b03). My operating system is Windows XP Service Pack 3. I downloaded the Moparscape client from the second link at http://www.moparisthebest.com/moparscape.html. If you need any additional information, I will give it as soon as I can. 

Thank you for reading this, and thank you in advance if you attempt to assist me.

EDIT: I found the link to a downloadable cache file, and I apologize for posting before checking.</description>
