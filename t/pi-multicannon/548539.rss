    <title>PI - Multicannon</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-multicannon/548539</link>
    <description>Decided to code a dwarf multicannon, since not many people have done one that&#39;s fully functional for PI.

some credit to &quot;Relex Lawl&quot; for the object anim method and rotation positions

There are not many people who have made a fully working Cannon for Project Insanity, that&#39;s handled simply and clean, and all in 1 class.
There are some codes for dwarf cannons released, that are messy and don&#39;t even work for normal PIs
So this is mine :)  



Features:
-When not in multi, cannon will attack the target that is engaged in combat with you
-Setting up the cannon is nice, just click the base and it starts to set up
-Gives decent range xp
-Shoots npcs that are within 12 tiles of the place it was built at.
-All handled in one class (no position.java or multicannonobject.java)
-Clean code
-Works perfectly knowing the owner of the cannon
-You cannot fire another person&#39;s cannon
-You can&#39;t pick up somebody else&#39;s cannon
-When the cannon is firing, it checks the rotation of the cannon, and the ball looks like it&#39;s actually coming out of the barrel
-Uses events
-Rotating is perfect, doesn&#39;t look dodgy

EDIT:
-Made it check if there are cannon&#39;s near the spot you are trying to set up and if there are, it stops.
-If you disconnect/log out, and your cannon is placed, the cannon stays in the spot, and when you log back in, the cannon object gets removed and all parts are added to your bank.
-If go to a spot where there are cannons placed, the objects are loaded (before, when you left and the map updated, they would disappear)
