    <title>(SOLVED) My client shows item and npc ids when right clicking, how do I disable?</title>

    <description>Hey guys,

So I moved on to a new blank client (that actually has proper inventory alignment ffs), and when I right click items and npcs it shows me an id in green brackets. I want to disable this because it&#39;s really immersion killing for me. Can anyone help me please?

Thank you!

SOLVED: For those wondering, I disabled these by going into client.java and searching for @gre@ until I found something that said &quot;menuActionName[menuActionRow] = &quot;Use @lre@&quot; + itemDef.name + @gre@(@whi@ class9_1 @gre@);&quot; and changed it to &quot;menuActionName[menuActionRow] = &quot;Use @lre@&quot; + itemDef.name;&quot; That gets rid of the item id in brackets. I continued searching and removed this from objects and npcs as well :)</description>
