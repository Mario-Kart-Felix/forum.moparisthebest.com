    <title>Skillcape Shop Crashes Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skillcape-shop-crashes-client/537636</link>
    <description>I found my old RSPS files and decided to give it another go since I&#39;ve always had so much fun running them :D

However, I&#39;ve run into a few problems I&#39;d like to fix before I open it back up(I&#39;ll probably be in the help section a lot)

The first of which being this: My skillcape shop crashes the client when you try to open it. It&#39;s a weird problem because strangely enough when your inventory is empty(or low in some cases), the cape shop functions mostly the way it&#39;s supposed to, like giving untrimmed capes for only 1 99, trimmed for 2 or more and gives the hood too, but sometimes it will put a strange item at the end that you know is obviously not supposed to be there, like burnt gnome eye and noted sharks

I don&#39;t really understand how it finds the right skillcape to put in the shop and I have a bad feeling the problem is somewhere in that code.

I have an array of(only untrimmed) skillcapes it draws from if you have the 99 for it:
[code]		public int[] skillCapes = {9747,9753,9750,9768,9756,9759,9762,9801,9807,9783,9798,9804,9780,9795,9792,9774,9771,9777,9786,9810,9765};[/code]

I&#39;ve spent like 2 hours looking this code over using process of elimination commenting out certain parts of it to try and isolate the problem and I think I may have found it.

Here&#39;s my cape setup process: 
[code]		public void setupSkillCapes(int capes, int capes2) {
			synchronized(c) {
				c.getItems().resetItems(3823);
				c.isShopping = true;
				c.myShopId = 14;
				c.getPA().sendFrame248(3824, 3822);
				c.getPA().sendFrame126(&quot;Skillcape Shop&quot;, 3901);
				
				int TotalItems = 0;
				TotalItems = capes2;
				if (TotalItems &gt; Server.shopHandler.MaxShopItems) {
					TotalItems = Server.shopHandler.MaxShopItems;
				}
				/*c.getOutStream().createFrameVarSizeWord(53);
				c.getOutStream().writeWord(3900);
				c.getOutStream().writeWord(TotalItems);
				int TotalCount = 0;
				for (int i = 0; i &lt; 21; i++) {
					if (c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[i]) &lt; 99)
						continue;
					c.getOutStream().writeByte(1);
					c.getOutStream().writeWordBigEndianA(skillCapes[i] + 2);
					TotalCount++;
				}*/
				c.getOutStream().endFrameVarSizeWord();
				c.flushOutStream();	
			}
		}
		[/code]


As you can see, I commented out part of the code with /**/ 

I&#39;ll be honest I have no idea what that part of the code does, but I ran my server and it opens the shop without crashing the client, but the shop is completely empty and whenever I go to another shop then to the skillcape one it displays the items from the previous shop I went to in the skillcape shop.

PROGRESS! Sorry I know this is a very specific problem but let me know if you want me to post anything else on here and thanks for taking the time to read, I really appreciate it!</description>

You’re ending something that isn’t started…<br>
What I mean is, you commented out the entire part of your skillcape shop that actually loads the shop up, besides the endframe.<br>
You have no startframe. This code should work though (I just modified yours):</p>

<pre><code>	int TotalItems = 0;

<p>Worked like a charm, thank you so much my good sir!</p>
