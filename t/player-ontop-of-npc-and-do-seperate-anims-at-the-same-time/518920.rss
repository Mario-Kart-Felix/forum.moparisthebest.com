    <description>ok just wondering im working on something unique and i was wondering how would i go about making player do a certain animation that involves him sitting on a npc and when player moves the npc stays under him and moves as he does

so making a player and npc do both seperate anims at the same time of a click and making them move as well with each other</description>
