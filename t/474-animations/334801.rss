    <title>474 animations?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/474-animations/334801</link>
    <description>Okay, I&#39;m trying to get a few animations from a 474 cache I had extracted a while back which I just found on my C:/ drive, I was just wondering..How would I get the animations? As in..Which folder would the animations be in?


The cache folder looks like this:

[table]
[tr]
[td]Cache0
Cache1
Cache2
Cache3
Cache4
Cache5
Cache6
Cache7
Cache8
Cache9
Cache10
Cache11
Cache12
Cache13
Cache14
Cache15
Cache255
Model[/td]
[/tr]
[/table]

I have no idea which folder the animations would be in. I have the animation viewer I just don&#39;t know which folder the animations are in.


Thanks for the future reference.</description>
