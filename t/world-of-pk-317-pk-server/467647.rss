- Double Experience in multiple areas 

[u]23-10-2012[/u]
- Rewrote Trading

[u]22-10-2012[/u]
- Worldwide pking
- Multiple pking in Wilderness
- No experience while pking 



World of PK will be a pking server as the name says.

To encourage people to train inside the wilderness, there will be double experience when training in Wilderness.

The server will have have worldwide pking, except for the main cities (Lumbridge, Varrock, Camelot, Edgeville, ...). On these locations you can find the shops.

It&#39;s not because there&#39;s worldwide pking, you&#39;ll have double experience worldwide, the double experience will only be active while in the official RuneScape Wilderness, which will also be multiple pking.

To train your combat skills, you&#39;ll have to fight npc&#39;s that are located all-over the WOP world, there won&#39;t be attackable npc&#39;s inside the main cities. This means you&#39;ll always have a chance to die. This means NO AFKING.

To train your non-combat skills, you&#39;ll have the possibility to train all-over the world also, skills will be trainable inside main cities also.

Alot more is coming soon...
