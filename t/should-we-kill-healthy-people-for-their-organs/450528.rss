    <title>Should we kill healthy people for their organs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-we-kill-healthy-people-for-their-organs/450528</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose Bill is a healthy man without family or loved ones. Would it be ok painlessly to kill him if his organs would save five people, one of whom needs a heart, another a kidney, and so on? If not, why not?
Consider another case: you and six others are kidnapped, and the kidnapper somehow persuades you that if you shoot dead one of the other hostages, he will set the remaining five free, whereas if you do not, he will shoot all but one. (Either way, he&#39;ll release you.)
If in this case you should kill one to save five, why not in the previous, organs case? If in this case too you have qualms, consider yet another: you&#39;re in the cab of a runaway tram and see five people tied to the track ahead. You have the option of sending the tram on to the track forking off to the left, on which only one person is tied. Surely you should send the tram left, killing one to save five.
But then why not kill Bill?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Let&#39;s get them juices flowing!

Make sure you post why you agree or disagree with this. Not just &quot;No.&quot;

There is some water inside of the cave and it is slowly rising. You conveniently have a stick of dynamite and a box of matches in your pocket. Do you…<br>
A) Blow up Bob and rescue everyone else trapped inside.<br>

<p>Personally I would say sorry Bob, you were a nice friend and all, but I’d rather have 1 death on my conscience than 5.</p>
<p>As far as killing people for their organs… There is no need to. Plenty of people die of natural causes/not-so-natural causes every day. There’s no need to take a life that isn’t its time yet.</p>

              <p>“For some to be immortal, many must die”</p>
<p>That is the thought that comes into my when when I think of this subject matter. The quote is from the movie “In Time” where everyone is genetically engineered to have a timer in them that starts when they turn 25, and they never age physically again.  The time can essentially be controlled by those in power, and in turn, live for centuries. Killing people for healthy organs to sustain one’s life could be abused by those with money or power as well. If anyone has ever read the book “House of the Scorpion” they’d know that the main plot revolves around stopping this because it was used by drug lords, living much longer than normally possible.</p>
<p>Just thinking of the ways this could be abused can easily make this turn into a bad idea. Its fairly obvious that some political leaders would use this to continue their reign.</p>
<p>[size=1pt]this post wasn’t very well structured at all. i guess thats what happens when you post while tired as anything[/size]</p>

Who said I said I don’t care about my life? I just stated that our lives are worthless. If your hinting money has value, it doesn’t. Things may have value to you but nothing has real value. Its like how perfection exists, perfection doesn’t exist but something may be perfect to a certain person. True value doesn’t exist but something may hold value to a certain person.</p>
