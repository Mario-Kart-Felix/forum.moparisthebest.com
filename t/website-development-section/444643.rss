    <description>I realise that there is already a web development board on [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/]moparisthebest.com[/url] but I&#39;d also see one here, I notice there aren&#39;t a lot of website developers in this part of the community, but there has been a growth in it recently, people have been asking more questions about website development and they&#39;re always looking for web developers. I think it&#39;d be good for people such as myself who only know website languages and don&#39;t know much Java to stick around in.

I&#39;d eventually like to see a category for website development, but that is something for moparisthebest.com, not for here.

Does anyone else share my views on this?</description>

              <p>Yeah that’s fine, it was just a suggestion since I spend more time on here than I do on MITB, it would benefit me and I’m sure others more. I’ll just need to increase my activity on <a href="http://mitb.com" rel="nofollow noopener">mitb.com</a> haha.</p>

              <p>Two other people have, in fact, posted this exact same suggestion. For lack of thorough repetition, we essentially said that there is no need for such a board here. Everything on this site is supposed to be specific to rs private servers. We have a few general boards as an exception, but they exist to encapsulate all other discussion that doesn’t fit in the rs boards. We tend not to create a lot of generic boards, as that further separates this forum from the mitb forum, which is not what we want to do.</p>
<p>I hope this answers the request.</p>
