    <title>Packets help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packets-help/430172</link>
    <description>Okay, so i dont know if this would be server sided, or client sided, so if i posted in wrong section, sorry.

The problem is, When im in the slayertower, and use the stairs to go up a floor, it loads, but the screen stays black, and it stays on loading please wait. It wasn&#39;t doing this before, so i have no idea. If someone could please help, or tell me why it is staying at loading please wait, and a black screen, that would be great. But, i&#39;m pretty sure, it has to do with the client, sending packets to the server. But not too sure.

Also the source base, is PI. But i have updated it a ton. But since the last update, its doing this at slayer tower now, And i didnt even do anything that has to do with the stairs, at the slayer tower.</description>
