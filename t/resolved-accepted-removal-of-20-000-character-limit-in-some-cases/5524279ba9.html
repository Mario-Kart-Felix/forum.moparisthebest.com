</aside>
<p>What happens when users want it increased again? Do we bump it again? I’m all for getting a specific number, but my question is, at what point do we start to seriously consider alternatives? Honestly, I don’t see very many user complaints about this; usually when I see something in server help, the user posts it on pastebin anyways. If the primary use case for this is for the Tutorials Section, then perhaps we could lift the limit in those places. But then another question I have is, perhaps tutorials as a whole can be done differently.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Taharok, 20k is a fine limit. It has been around for a long time and until recently no one has ever cared enough to need it changed.</p>
<p>As suggested why not raise it in tutorials, the development sections, and the advertising section. Those are the only areas I can see it needing to be raise to say 35k.</p>
<p>As for in the help sections, as said before and in the above post. Pastebin should be used for full classes. No point what so ever for a person to need to post the entire class in the topic.</p>
<p>EDIT: As for the double posting, just do what we have done in the past. Get someone you trust or even a mod to post the moment you create your thread, post again, other posts, you post, other posts. After which the other person deletes their posts and you now have 4-7 reserve posts for use.[/quote]</p>
<p>People have been complaining about the 20k limit for the last 8 years. As far as I’m concerned, there’s no harm in raising the limit to accommodate people now. Modifying the code of the forum is the hardest way to make a change to anything here, which is why it’s unlikely. The only change that I think is worthwhile aside from just upping the limit is to allow double posting if it’s immediately after the main post and the last post is above some certain threshold of size. This is likely easy to program and achieves the exact effect people want: to be able to post as large of topics as they want initially. Replies are very rarely over 20k.</p>

<p>Please grow up. I am not looking to prevent changes on the forum, I am looking to prevent worthless changes. Please don’t take a single line out of my entire post and spew your hate because a change hasn’t been made in your favor. Through out the entire topic you haven’t suggested any new idea or even a compromise to upping the limit, in fact all you have said this entire time is “why not just increase the limit???”. You cannot even contribute any real reason other than “I want to post my entire class so I don’t have to use pastebin”. Just shows that you have put little to no thought in your suggestion at all. As for all the links you posted as reasons why it should be increase, all of them are full sized classes that should be in the pastebin anyways. So again why increase the limit when pastebin can be used for large amounts of code that is only going to be copied and pasted into a file?</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/mCN10TS8" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/mCN10TS8</a><br>

<a href="http://pastebin.com/UWx1uNZH" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/UWx1uNZH</a></p>
<p>As I said before I am not against the idea of raising the limit. I am against the idea of just raising it to make certain members happier because they cannot post full sized classes. I am for increasing the limit for certain areas of the forum that need it (“Tutorials, Advertisements, and Development.”). Even then you should still use pastebin for large amounts of code that need to be copied and pasted into a file.</p>

<p>there’s nothing stopping anyone from just surrounding whatever they want with bb code and having no limits at all.</p>

<p>talk out of your ass some more. It’s been a problem for me, and others for a while now. There’s no point in changing something that really would have no negative effects. Seems like people just will look for whatever reason they can to prevent change, on this forum anyway.</p>

<p>I didn’t realize this topic picked up steam again. I kind of just let the idea die because none of the admins seemed to care. I really just want a substantial increase, or alternative to 20k limit. I’ll let the admins decide what’s best. There’s some okay ideas being thrown out</p>

<p>Please grow up. I am not looking to prevent changes on the forum, I am looking to prevent worthless changes. Please don’t take a single line out of my entire post and spew your hate because a change hasn’t been made in your favor. Through out the entire topic you haven’t suggested any new idea or even a compromise to upping the limit, in fact all you have said this entire time is “why not just increase the limit???”. You cannot even contribute any real reason other than “I want to post my entire class so I don’t have to use pastebin”. Just shows that you have put little to no thought in your suggestion at all. As for all the links you posted as reasons why it should be increase, all of them are full sized classes that should be in the pastebin anyways. So again why increase the limit when pastebin can be used for large amounts of code that is only going to be copied and pasted into a file?</p>

<p>As I said before I am not against the idea of raising the limit. I am against the idea of just raising it to make certain members happier because they cannot post full sized classes. I am for increasing the limit for certain areas of the forum that need it (“Tutorials, Advertisements, and Development.”). Even then you should still use pastebin for large amounts of code that need to be copied and pasted into a file.[/quote]</p>
<p>If the change is worthless please state how? I’m not hating on you at all, just wanted to point out that ignorant statement you made. You really did make that statement based on just about nothing. “No one has ever cared enough…” well obviously that’s wrong because I clearly made a thread about it and it has supporters behind it. I have in fact suggested compromises such as removing the limit in general for the tutorial section, dev section, help section, among others (which i don’t believe is a good idea now that i’ve thought about it).</p>

<p>As I stated in the OP: (Server tutorials, Server development, Server Help, Private server client hacking) are all sections that would benefit from this. I’m sorry if you’re slightly illiterate and could only read the part where I want to be able to post a whole class, which by the way isn’t as ridiculous of a request as you might think.</p>
<p>It’s personal preference whether or not to post code in code tags or on pastebin. There is no rule that I know of that states I have to choose pastebin over code tags.</p>
<p>You are literally the only person who is against this. All I suggested is we do something about it, and we should be able to come together as a forum to think of a better way to do this. It’s not my sole job as the OP to figure out a solution. So, if it’s such a useless change, please state why because I don’t see any reasoning behind your opinion.</p>
<p>You are the one who needs to grow up, child.</p>

        <p>The character limit has been extended to 50,000. We can deal with any annoying cases of abuse as they occur, not like such cases weren’t already possible before hand though. I came to 50,000 given the cases of reaching the limit I’ve been messaged about that I could find, it seems to accommodate everyone. I get the arguments for having it higher, but let’s not be pedantic, it’s fine. If you need more than 50,000 characters in one individual topic then I don’t see the issue with sectioning it off into multiple linked topics, or we can work something out for you.</p>
<p>Solved.</p>
