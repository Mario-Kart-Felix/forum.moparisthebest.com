    <title>Hey all, I&#39;ve got a problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hey-all-ive-got-a-problem/384707</link>
    <description>First off, I know this is my first post..you can call me a leech or whatever. It won&#39;t effect me in any way. Now down to the problem.

I am currently trying to create a 317 RSPS. (By the way, sorry I&#39;m not dumb when it comes to copmuters/RSPS...in other words..I&#39;m not a 10 year old trying to create one. ;D)I am using Extreme-X&#39;s source and client. However for some reason I am just not able to get on the server. Let me tell you guys everything that I have done, I think I might be missing something..maybe someone could see it. I am able to get on the client but when I try to log in I get the error message.

1. I of course downloaded the source and client, unziped...in the Source Run and compile I added my JDK to it (Most recent) 
Also in the client build and run I added the correct JDK.

2. I set up the following variable:
PATH : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin\

3. I set up no-ip..added the IP from ipchicken.com.
Downloaded it, and got my host name all set.

4.Changed the old host 3 times in the client.java to my host. (Is there somewhere else I&#39;m suppose to do this?)

5. I port forwarded..however I am having some crazy problems with this. Sometimes the port is open, sometimes its not. But I would think that I should be able to still get on it with this right? But, I have spent a couple hours on port fowarding and I have no idea whats going on. I even dl&#39;ed a program that does it for me..its worked in the past.

6. random question: Would my IP have to be dynamic or static..or does that not matter?

Well thats everything I can think of. Please suggest everything to me. I am so confused, I once was working with a RSPS and I never had any problems...I don&#39;t know why I am now.

Thanks! Take care!</description>

<p>hmm, I’m new to making RSPS. I don’t spend all my time focusing on them. And I never said I was advanced in computers, I just said I wans’nt dumb with them.</p>

<p>YOU SIR! Are a miracle worker, I don’t know why I failed to use the loopback address. This worked, I am now in. But I would not be able to use this with this IP would I?</p>

<p>I can log into my no-ip…what I cant log into is the server. When I type my user and pass in…I get the common error message “can not connect to server” or whatever it is. I can not log into it what so ever.</p>

              <p>First off, I know this is my first post…you can call me a leech or whatever. It won’t effect me in any way. Now down to the problem.</p>
<p>I am currently trying to create a 317 RSPS. (By the way, sorry I’m not dumb when it comes to copmuters/RSPS…in other words…I’m not a 10 year old trying to create one. ;D)I am using Extreme-X’s source and client. However for some reason I am just not able to get on the server. Let me tell you guys everything that I have done, I think I might be missing something…maybe someone could see it. I am able to get on the client but when I try to log in I get the error message.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I of course downloaded the source and client, unziped…in the Source Run and compile I added my JDK to it (Most recent)<br>
Also in the client build and run I added the correct JDK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I set up the following variable:<br>
PATH : C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin\</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I set up no-ip…added the IP from <a href="http://ipchicken.com" rel="nofollow noopener">ipchicken.com</a>.<br>
Downloaded it, and got my host name all set.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.Changed the old host 3 times in the client.java to my host. (Is there somewhere else I’m suppose to do this?)</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>I port forwarded…however I am having some crazy problems with this. Sometimes the port is open, sometimes its not. But I would think that I should be able to still get on it with this right? But, I have spent a couple hours on port fowarding and I have no idea whats going on. I even dl’ed a program that does it for me…its worked in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>random question: Would my IP have to be dynamic or static…or does that not matter?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Well thats everything I can think of. Please suggest everything to me. I am so confused, I once was working with a RSPS and I never had any problems…I don’t know why I am now.</p>
<p>Thanks! Take care!</p>
