-=Edge of Eternity is a 40-slot dedicated Minecraft SMP Bukkit Server=-
-=IP: 176.31.226.225:25643=-
Server is located in EU, with minimal lag worldwide.


What you will find at EoE:
Mature, Respectful Community ∞ 100% Legit Gameplay ∞ Ironclad Anti-Grief System
Theft Prevention with Lockette ∞ Near-Vanilla Survival ∞ Gamemode 0 Leadership
Ingame Shops with Chestshop ∞ Superflat Creative Map via Multiverse ∞ Age Limit 17
Enhanced Gameplay with mcMMO ∞ Whitelist Protection ∞ 30-slot Mumble Server


What you will not find:
PVP/Factions ∞ Stealing ∞ Griefing ∞ Pixel Art ∞ Juveniles
Whining ∞ Plugins Galore ∞ Handouts/Hand-Holding


Statement of Purpose:
Our goal is to provide a fun, relaxed gaming environment in which the player can enjoy the challenge
of the game without having to worry about the malicious intentions of others.
∞
We have accomplished this, not through rigorous screening of applicants or with draconian moderators,
but simply as a by-product of the atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation that exists in our small
community. We employ only the bare minimum of game-enhancing plugins, preferring to embrace
the Survival aspect of the game to the fullest.
∞
Most who apply are accepted, and our few simple rules are seldom broken.
Despite the danger, the Edge is kept relaxed and groovy.
Why not come and see for yourself?

              <p>Sorry, I don’t think that’s good enough. The migration to IPv6 is not just about maintaining backwards compatibility with IPv4, it’s about the encapsulation and endurance of next-generation development. It’s about syndicating the residential infrastructure to provide families with the stability and precedence they need. It’s about the children who may grow up never learning about NAT and the degenerance it provided.</p>
