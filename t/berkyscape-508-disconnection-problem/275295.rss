    <title>Berkyscape 508 disconnection problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/berkyscape-508-disconnection-problem/275295</link>
    <description>Im having a problem with berkyscape and all the sources made from it... or the one berky is made from not too sure.. BUT THE POINT IS i randomly disconnect from it. i would be training hunting or something and i would disconnect like i logged out (didnt have the &quot;connection lost&quot; sign). i would sign back on and i would log out a few minutes later. is this just because my computer sucks (which it doesn&#39;t) or a coding error. (NOTE: i didn&#39;t make any changes to it)

Thanks for your help</description>
