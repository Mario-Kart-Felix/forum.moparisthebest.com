A scientific theory does not imply uncertainty. It means “a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena” basically, it means it is backed up by evidence. Are you going to start disputing the theory of gravity, atomic theory, etc.?[/quote]<br>
No because that is evidence we understand, the evidence for expanding the universe is evidence we don’t know about, it’s evidence we can’t test, it’s evidence beyond our current scope of knowledge and because of this it is still a theory and could possibly be untrue on the whole</p>

<p>fine i have a theory you are retarded, therefore you are? This isn’t a belief it is something that <span class="bbcode-i">could</span> be tested if you are at the right place, if the universe is expaning and you are on the edge of the universe and you couldn’t move further then if you wait a while you can move further, therefore the universe is expanding. And the swans are white idea is a bad one because you would have to see EVERY swan not just random sampling. Especially seeing as how there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Black Swan</a>[/quote]</p>
<p>No that wouldn’t fall under theory or hypothesis, you may use theory out of context and say that but really when you use theory our of context like that it just shows that you have no respect for literacy and absolutely no respect for Science.  If i’m retarded then you’d be a schizophrenic feces eating basket case.  See if you call me retarded and act as if i’m the stupid one it doesn’t make you any smarter.  I don’t know how you can base all your arguments on bullshit and only want to win for pride and glory.<br>
I’m not trying to win an argument, i’m trying to educated you.  Science isn’t a democracy, you cannot pick and choose evidence and you cannot pick and choose theories.<br>
This is another reason why you saying that you have a theory that i’m retarded is well ironically enough retarded.  That can be tested and has.  I’m not retarded in any way in fact I classify under Genius based on my IQ and other tests.</p>
<p>By saying what you’ve said you’ve gone against the entire Scientific Community, you’ve gone against what is obvious and instead have tried to obscure it into something which is not in a pathetic attempt to prove your claim.</p>
<p>No the swans are all white idea is not a bad idea.  Since you have absolutely no brain power and your aim is not to understand what i’m saying to reply with an intelligent, masterful rebuttle I will explain it to you in terms even a 3 year old can understand.</p>
<p>Steps in order for how the hypothesis of “All Swans Must be White” was made, why it is testable and what needs to happen for it to become a theory.<br>
First we make an OBSERVATION.  This observation is that every swan I’ve ever seen is white.<br>
Then we turn that observation into a HYPOTHESIS which will be in this context: All swans must be white.<br>
Then we must TEST this hypothesis by doing the following: Taking a random sampling of swans from each continent where swans are indigenous produces only white swans.<br>
Publishing the results, analyzing, evaluating and explaining them eg: “My global research has indicated that swans are always white, wherever they are observed.”<br>
Verifying they are all white with OTHER SCIENTISTS in the world: Every swan any other scientist has ever observed in any country has always been white.<br>
Finally the theory can be made: All swans are white.</p>
<p>Now lets look, there are 6 steps right lets look at the timeframe of these:<br>
Step 1: n/a<br>
Step 2: n/a<br>
Step 3: in this case 1-6 months, depends on how thorough the testing is<br>
Step 4: usually a week or two<br>
Step 5: at minimum about a year though usually it takes decades<br>
Step 6: n/a<br>
So that’s at minimum a year one month and a week and on average 10 years 3 months and a couple weeks.</p>
<p>Now lets look at your little “theory” shall we:<br>
Observation: That your perception of wayzey is that he is retarded<br>
Hypothesis: That wayzey is in someway retarded<br>
Test: Wayzey undergoes a neurological exam to see if he is physically or mentally retarded<br>
Publication: An analyzation, explanation and evaluation of results is published such as “From all tests made there were signs that wayzey was definitely in somewhat way retarded”<br>
Verification: Your publication and results are looked at by other Scientists and are disputed for decades between them to determine whether or not the results are consistent and accurate.<br>
Theory: After doing all that your idea of me being retarded can finally be a Scientific theory congratulations</p>
<p>So lets now look at how far we got to before we had a problem:<br>
Well an observation was made<br>
You made the claim that I was retarded, we will use that as the hypothesis as we have nothing else to run off of<br>
I’ve been through testing when I was a child because I didn’t pay attention at all in class and was getting A’s in everything, tests showed that i’m not retarded but nowhere near, tests showed that I have nothing physically or mentally wrong with me</p>
<p>So you got to test, that’s not even 1/10000 of the way to making that belief a theory.  Oh and yes it’s a belief because after looking at testing results we find that your observations were false so you have no observation now just an idea, a belief.</p>

<p>how would a retard know he’s retarded?<br>
By looking back and realising that I just explained all this and instead of reading it and learn from it you ignore it.  See if you question it that’s fine but when you just completely ignore it that just shows you’re an arrogant, stubborn, asshole.</p>

Well an observation was made<br>
You made the claim that I was retarded, we will use that as the hypothesis as we have nothing else to run off of<br>
I’ve been through testing when I was a child because I didn’t pay attention at all in class and was getting A’s in everything, tests showed that i’m not retarded but nowhere near, tests showed that I have nothing physically or mentally wrong with me</p>
<p>So you got to test, that’s not even 1/10000 of the way to making that belief a theory.  Oh and yes it’s a belief because after looking at testing results we find that your observations were false so you have no observation now just an idea, a belief.</p>

<p>A scientific theory does not imply uncertainty. It means “a coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena” basically, it means it is backed up by evidence. Are you going to start disputing the theory of gravity, atomic theory, etc.?</p>

</aside>
<p>No because that is evidence we understand, the evidence for expanding the universe is evidence we don’t know about, it’s evidence we can’t test, it’s evidence beyond our current scope of knowledge and because of this it is still a theory and could possibly be untrue on the whole</p>

<p>how would a retard know he’s retarded?<br>
By looking back and realising that I just explained all this and instead of reading it and learn from it you ignore it.  See if you question it that’s fine but when you just completely ignore it that just shows you’re an arrogant, stubborn, asshole.[/quote]<br>
‘trying to educated you’ i like that, maybe next time i’ll use it an english exam. And yes im sure you do qualify under a genius according to an IQ test, I do as well and im sure most people on this site do. But an IQ test isn’t a test of what you know its the manner in which your brain works. An IQ test determines one way in which your brain works, there are many others unless you are a simple robot, which i doubt you are.<br>
If you were retarded i would be schizophrenic feces eating basket case? Anything to do with me is not reliant upon your intelligence or inabilities, if it does i would be most concerned.<br>
I havnt gone against the scientific community by suggesting a scientific way in which the expansion of the  unvierse could be tested if you were in the right place at the right time. How that goes against the scientific community i’d love to know, drop me a pm about it.<br>
Back to the swans, if you proposed that theory and then got validation from scientists across the world to check your theory they would shoot it down, because australian scientists would say that they have seen black swans and thats because black swans come from Australia.<br>
I’d like to see these test results to see whether you were tested for being a retard, what worries me more is that your parents though you were retarded and had to get you checked. A retardation can also be developed so you’d have to be tested again because those results are technically invalid. Time passes, people change, the mind changes.<br>
And to the last paragraph. I can ignore your arguments much as you ignore mine its the freedom of choice that allows you to do this.<br>
And finally: putting in long words and padding your post out with shit doesnt make you intelligent, or even seem it so don’t bother. Keep it short and sweet so i don’t get the temptation to jump out the window with boredom whilst reading it, its not a particaularly pleasent urge and i must say its rather ‘wayzey’ induced. If you keep going at this rate im going to need to set up a charity for people who have to read this drivel.</p>

<p>No that wouldn’t fall under theory or hypothesis, you may use theory out of context and say that but really when you use theory our of context like that it just shows that you have no respect for literacy and absolutely no respect for Science.  If i’m retarded then you’d be a schizophrenic feces eating basket case.  See if you call me retarded and act as if i’m the stupid one it doesn’t make you any smarter.  I don’t know how you can base all your arguments on bullshit and only want to win for pride and glory.<br>
I’m not trying to win an argument, i’m trying to <span class="bbcode-b">educated</span> you.  Science isn’t a democracy, you cannot pick and choose evidence and you cannot pick and choose theories.<br>
This is another reason why you saying that you have a theory that i’m retarded is well ironically enough retarded.  That can be tested and has.  I’m not retarded in any way in fact I classify under Genius based on my IQ and other tests.</p>
<p>By saying what you’ve said you’ve gone against the entire Scientific Community, you’ve gone against what is obvious and instead have tried to obscure it into something which is not in a pathetic attempt to prove your claim.</p>
<p>No the swans are all white idea is not a bad idea.  Since you have absolutely no brain power and your aim is not to understand what i’m saying to reply with an intelligent, masterful rebuttle I will explain it to you in terms even a 3 year old can understand.</p>
<p>Steps in order for how the hypothesis of “All Swans Must be White” was made, why it is testable and what needs to happen for it to become a theory.<br>
First we make an OBSERVATION.  This observation is that every swan I’ve ever seen is white.<br>
Then we turn that observation into a HYPOTHESIS which will be in this context: All swans must be white.<br>
Then we must TEST this hypothesis by doing the following: Taking a random sampling of swans from each continent where swans are indigenous produces only white swans.<br>
Publishing the results, analyzing, evaluating and explaining them eg: “My global research has indicated that swans are always white, wherever they are observed.”<br>
Verifying they are all white with OTHER SCIENTISTS in the world: Every swan any other scientist has ever observed in any country has always been white.<br>
Finally the theory can be made: All swans are white.</p>
<p>Now lets look, there are 6 steps right lets look at the timeframe of these:<br>
Step 1: n/a<br>
Step 2: n/a<br>
Step 3: in this case 1-6 months, depends on how thorough the testing is<br>
Step 4: usually a week or two<br>
Step 5: at minimum about a year though usually it takes decades<br>
Step 6: n/a<br>
So that’s at minimum a year one month and a week and on average 10 years 3 months and a couple weeks.</p>
<p>Now lets look at your little “theory” shall we:<br>
Observation: That your perception of wayzey is that he is retarded<br>
Hypothesis: That wayzey is in someway retarded<br>
Test: Wayzey undergoes a neurological exam to see if he is physically or mentally retarded<br>
Publication: An analyzation, explanation and evaluation of results is published such as “From all tests made there were signs that wayzey was definitely in somewhat way retarded”<br>
Verification: Your publication and results are looked at by other Scientists and are disputed for decades between them to determine whether or not the results are consistent and accurate.<br>
Theory: After doing all that your idea of me being retarded can finally be a Scientific theory congratulations</p>
<p>So lets now look at how far we got to before we had a problem:<br>
Well an observation was made<br>
You made the claim that I was retarded, we will use that as the hypothesis as we have nothing else to run off of<br>
I’ve been through testing when I was a child because I didn’t pay attention at all in class and was getting A’s in everything, tests showed that i’m not retarded but nowhere near, tests showed that I have nothing physically or mentally wrong with me</p>
<p>So you got to test, that’s not even 1/10000 of the way to making that belief a theory.  Oh and yes it’s a belief because after looking at testing results we find that your observations were false so you have no observation now just an idea, a belief.</p>

<p>Whoa, you never learn anything do you.</p>
<p>I’m just going to drop this because you obviously don’t understand what taking things out of their context means and you have completely disregarded the points I have made in my posts(all of them) and instead have looked at explanations as if they are literal and supposed to accurately portray the real world.  I don’t want to get started on freedom of choice, no you don’t know anything about it and it’s not called freedom of choice, you look at the choices humans make based on many different factors and I don’t want to get into that topic.</p>
<p>Pretty much you skew my words to try and make me look foolish but really you’re the fool as my words only represent points of which I have addressed and you disregard.  If you are to take everything I say out of context then and attempt to change what I say by pointing out a perception of it that I was not intending and that most people wouldn’t perceive it as.</p>
<p>A genius in IQ scores simply means you’re in the top 1% of people in the world.  I’m in the top 0.1% or something I don’t really care about IQ that much I was simply saying that I am not retarded in that manner as anything below an IQ of 85 is retarded and anything above 140 is genius(in the IQ test that I took).</p>
<p>I tried to explain things in the most simplistic terms I possibly could have and when I do you just skew the meanings of my sentences and words, if I go back to explaining properly then you just take everything that I say out of context in a sad attempt to make me seem like the one who is retarded and stupid.</p>
<p>I’d like to apologize to everyone else who posted on this thread for continuing this argument, I should have ended it sooner as I was pretty sure we were never going to come to an understanding.  This apology is not directed at Sanga as he is incredibly arrogant, stubborn and has no respect for Science, Literacy and just learning in particular.</p>

yes ladies and genleman apprently i am stubborn and arrogrant and have no respect for learning. I have taken nothing out of context, i have taken what you have said in the literary context you have put it in, however poorly assembled. So you are the top 0.1% in the IQ tests huh?those fake ones on facebook dont count so dont kid yourself, i can beleive you to be 130+ but top 0.1% is pushing it. And how can you say i ignored your points when i addressed each in a logical manner? you do know how to read right?</p>

I have taken nothing out of context, i have taken what you have said in the literary context you have put it in, however poorly assembled. So you are the top 0.1% in the IQ tests huh?those fake ones on facebook dont count so dont kid yourself, i can beleive you to be 130+ but top 0.1% is pushing it. And how can you say i ignored your points when i addressed each in a logical manner? you do know how to read right?</p>

</aside>
<p>Well actually the IQ test was when I was in grade 3 I scored 154 classifying me under genius.  I explained that I took it because in year 3 I wasn’t paying any attention at school and somehow was top of the class.<br>
If you want I can find the official documents but really I don’t care that much, I only bring something like this up when another person says i’m an idiot because of my age or when someone calls me retarded in frustration.  Then I bring it up to show how pointless calling me a retard or using my age as an excuse is because my IQ is much, much higher than average so I could equally say that because my IQ is higher I must be smarter.  Of course that’d just be bullshit and I know that, the only reason I do it is to try to get them off pointless insults and get them arguing the topic.</p>
<p>Look i’m just going to stop now, I don’t care if you don’t believe that above.  Please don’t reply to this comment, reply to someone elses if you’re going to argue, argue with them since like jme said this is taking it beyond debate.</p>
<p>Oh and sorry jme for the insults I tried to keep mine as clever as possible instead of just calling him retarded and well calling him arrogant and stubborn though is an insult i’m not joking about it.  Like a stupid insult would be for me to call him ignorant and incredibly stupid and if I even said anything along those lines, sorry.  When I call someone who is being arrogant and stubborn, arrogant and stubborn though it is an insult i’m just explaining how I perceive you as a person.</p>

        <p>You mean that you take the test when you are 8-9 years old?<br>
That explains everything, IQ on professional test are often based on your age. So I doubt you still have the same IQ. And just for fun, why not take this test: <a href="http://mensa.dk/iqtest/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mensa.dk/iqtest/</a> and post your result.</p>

<p>There is no evidence for the existance of jesus apart from the bible, which is very questionable as it was been translated over 9000 times, each copyer modifying it with their own agenda. It is <span class="bbcode-i">not</span> a historical document.</p>
<p>The bible says the world was created in 6 days, that the mathematical constant pi is equal to exactly 3, that you wont die if you drink poison as long as you believe in jesus, and it is full of contradictions.<br>
Its obvious that the bible is not worthy of any kind of trust.</p>

        <p>Christians, and followers of other religions, base their belief on feelings. They pray, and believe it helps. It’s like a placebo effect.</p>
<p>John prayed to god, and now he doesn’t have a headache anymore.<br>
John took a placebo, and now he doesn’t have a headache anymore.<br>
John killed a man, and now he doesn’t have a headache anymore.</p>
<p>I don’t see a difference between the two. If John believes in something, it can help. In that point, religion isn’t a bad thing. But religion doesn’t stay on that sector, it tries to explain everything. If you die, you won’t go to heaven or hell. God didn’t create you. Etc…</p>

        <p>[quote=“bowserjr2, post:148, topic:269719”]You mean that you take the test when you are 8-9 years old?<br>
That explains everything, IQ on professional test are often based on your age. So I doubt you still have the same IQ. And just for fun, why not take this test: <a href="http://mensa.dk/iqtest/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mensa.dk/iqtest/</a> and post your result.</p>
<p>But to the topic:<br>
You can’t prove or disprove God, but you can prove parts of it, like Jesus.<br>
About giving credit to God, if people think they got some help to a hard/impossible task why should it be wrong for them to give their help that they think is God credit?[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s not proving god.</p>
<p>Even if there was sufficient evidence for the existance of Jesus that wouldn’t prove god in any way.  Because it is impossible to observe god every claim for someone who has observed god must be false.  This is because apparently god only appears to that one person something of which you’d have to be an idiot to believe.</p>
<p>I took the test when I was in year 3, usually your IQ increases by about 5 points between the age of adolesent and adult since the brain isn’t completely formed yet or something like that.  The whole point of the IQ test was that judging a point by the persons charecteristics/age/race/ethnicity/religion/IQ/Intelligence is irrational and pointless.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to give god credit because it isn’t actually god who did it, it’s you who did it and anyone who gives god credit and not themselves or the person who did it is very deluded and should seek help.  When you complete a hard/impossible task then they should learn from it they should learn from their experiences.<br>
When people thank god for something others or themselves have done it becomes socially accepted and everyones starts to.  Things like that can change society over time, look at religion, look how negatively it has affected society, all religions were originally just someone talking bullshit which developed over time into a huge cult then eventually religion.  Just look at the adaptation of Christianity and Islam since their creation how pretty much all the bible has to now be interpreted but in the middle ages when it was put together it was seen as 100% literal and people lived their lives to it as if it were a code of standards.</p>
<p>Oh and with the mensa thing i’ve been looking and you have to pay to sit the test so no thanks.<br>

<p>I don’t see a difference between the two. If John believes in something, it can help. In that point, religion isn’t a bad thing. But religion doesn’t stay on that sector, it tries to explain everything. If you die, you won’t go to heaven or hell. God didn’t create you. Etc…[/quote]</p>
<p>So because a religion can dilude your mind to the point where you don’t feel certain pain that makes it ok?  You do know pain is there to help us.  If all you have to do is pray to god to get rid of pain then you learn nothing from experience.<br>
Not to mention that there is no evidence to prove John did that and even if he did there are an infinate amount of equal possibilities for why his headache might have disappeared.<br>
I understand your point but the thing is if people do that then it becomes socially accepted and forced upon reality, look at Science and how it’s having to put up with complete morons who think that because we havn’t dug up every skeleton of every animal that ever lived Evolution is wrong, how do u think Creationism started?</p>

<p>Oh and vikings didn’t believe in Christianity they believed in Pagan shit and gods like Odin, Thor, Tyr, Hel.  It’s not what people have done to Christianity it is what Chrisitianity is, the bible itself hasn’t been changed too much, there have been some stuff edited such as much of Josephus’s work and stuff added in like anti-gay passages but other than that the only real problem is translation.  The big difference though is that the bible was socially accepted in the Dark Ages and well look at the Dark Ages, there’s a reason why they’re called the Dark Ages and it’s mainly because of Christianity.</p>

<p>No no, you didn’t get my point. What I was saying, praying can have the same effect a placebo has. <span class="bbcode-b">Some symptoms are just symptoms of being a whiny ass.</span> They aren’t symptoms of any disease. So doing something that you think will cure it (taking a placebo pill for instance) will ‘cure’ it. Praying has the same effect. It doesn’t cure anything, it just gives you an arrogant feeling, which makes you think you are the best and it cures your whiny ass symptoms.</p>
<p>I’m against the spreading of any religion. It puts your current life in a corner, flagging it as a temporarily thing. You should live life in the present. There is no god, there is no heaven, and this life is all there is.</p>

Please not learn ME about vikings, St. Olaf/Olaf II of Norway used violent way to convert the people from the Norse Mythology to Christianity. But he also did good thing, like made the law equal for everybody, forbid slaves, forbid to set newborn out in the forrest and rise the punishment for rape.</p>
