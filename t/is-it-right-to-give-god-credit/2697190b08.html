<blockquote>
<p>Christians, and followers of other religions, base their belief on feelings. They pray, and believe it helps. It’s like a placebo effect.</p>
<p>John prayed to god, and now he doesn’t have a headache anymore.<br>
John took a placebo, and now he doesn’t have a headache anymore.<br>
John killed a man, and now he doesn’t have a headache anymore.</p>
<p>I don’t see a difference between the two. If John believes in something, it can help. In that point, religion isn’t a bad thing. But religion doesn’t stay on that sector, it tries to explain everything. If you die, you won’t go to heaven or hell. God didn’t create you. Etc…</p>

<p>So because a religion can dilude your mind to the point where you don’t feel certain pain that makes it ok?  You do know pain is there to help us.  If all you have to do is pray to god to get rid of pain then you learn nothing from experience.<br>
Not to mention that there is no evidence to prove John did that and even if he did there are an infinate amount of equal possibilities for why his headache might have disappeared.<br>
I understand your point but the thing is if people do that then it becomes socially accepted and forced upon reality, look at Science and how it’s having to put up with complete morons who think that because we havn’t dug up every skeleton of every animal that ever lived Evolution is wrong, how do u think Creationism started?</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>I was meaning the online test: <a href="http://mensa.dk/testiq.xml" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mensa.dk/testiq.xml</a><br>
And click “Start Testen” in the bottom of the site.<br>
That I was saying is that in a professional test a 10 year old and a 20 year old can get the same score, but the 20 year old are much smarter since the IQ score is changed because of your low age.</p>
<p>Yes I know the adaption of Christianity was no good, be Christian or die, but there is nothing in the bible saying you should do that(If so NT have say something else about it). You can’t blame the religion for something crazy Vikings or Roman Catholics have done.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ok i’ll do it now.  Oh and yes I konw it can change over time, the test I did was the one for my age, it’s expected that as you get older your IQ will not change from that tested, the tests are designed like that.</p>
<p>Oh and vikings didn’t believe in Christianity they believed in Pagan shit and gods like Odin, Thor, Tyr, Hel.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Please not learn ME about vikings, St. Olaf/Olaf II of Norway used violent way to convert the people from the Norse Mythology to Christianity. But he also did good thing, like made the law equal for everybody, forbid slaves, forbid to set newborn out in the forrest and rise the punishment for rape.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ok I did IQ thingy I don’t understand the launguage though so I took screenshots of all 3 options.<br>
Oh and this isn’t a proper IQ test a proper one takes hours to do and contains many, many parts.<br>
