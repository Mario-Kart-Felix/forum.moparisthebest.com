<p>Quite often, you hear people who have gone through a surgery talking about god doing all the work. Same applies to soccer players: many (Brazilian) soccer players thank god for their goals.</p>
<p>Fresh parents often see their child as a gift from god. A reward for their faith. But if god was the one who gave them their child, why did they even bother having sex? If god is the one who gave them their child, sex is rendered useless reproduction-wise. So they had sex for the fun of it. Which is a sin according to the some what more extreme Christians. A sin equals a lack of faith, so by saying that god gave them their child, the parents admit being sinners. And sinners don’t get rewards, do they? So god didn’t give them their child. Catch the drift? Ultimately, by saying that god gave you your child, you actually say that you aren’t religious at all.</p>
<p>People give credit to god when they survive an accident. God is the one who saved them. A surgeon did the surgery, but god guided him. Which makes me wonder: why are there surgeons? If god guides the surgeon, why do people become surgeons? A retard can be guided by god, so the retard can do the surgery too. So people praise god when they save their lives. But some people die after an accident. Who is to blame? God? Hell no, god never does anything wrong. It must be the driver of the car that smashed the deceased person’s car. But, as you can conclude from the short introduction of this topic: everyone is guided by god. So the driver is guided by god too.</p>
<p>Again, by saying the driver is to blame, you blame god.</p>

You misunderstand, 3.5 billion does not destroy the environment because there is not consequences.<br>
People that don’t care about the environment is the problem. Countries like Norway have earnt big amount of money by destroying the environment (Oil). And many countries use oil, coal and gas to produce electricity.<br>
Please do not connect religion and global warming.</p>
<p>The last one about the Muslims are that I have learnt at school, so if its wrong blame my teacher.</p>

<p>I’ve read the bible several times, and I’ve had religion study for quite a few years. The Jews Tanakh is the same as the old testament, but IIRC in a different order. And muslims believe in the same god too. I can’t remember the names of the characters, but it was the story of the two brothers, of which one was younger but destined to be the next leader. The father was blind, so the mother came up with the idea to stick sheep hair on the arms of the younger brother. So he could be named the leader. The older brother left with his mother, and he founded what is now called the Islam.</p>

<p>This is the most flawed statement I’ve ever read. There is a ton of evidence that shows that Humans were not the first animals on this planet. Even the idea that Humans were placed on earth as a finishing touch is stupid. The evolution toward the humans we are now has taken millions of years. Even the physical difference between humans now and humans in the middle ages is astonishing. Now we have plenty of food, so we are taller.</p>
<p>I’ve heard people say that we really come from Adam and Eve. By saying so, you can’t deny evolution. Adam and Eve where either white, black, or in between. So only evolution explains why there are different skin colors. But then you ask those people why we aren’t retarded, because we all are products of inbreeding. They say that it didn’t exist back then. But we all are descendants from 2 persons, so it doesn’t matter how many generations are in between.</p>

because christians dont actually read the bible, if they did they would do life alot differently. There are things in the bible that say do one thing whereas later on it says to do another. It is the most contradictory book in history</p>

Teachers at my school [and students] debate over whether Judaism, Christianity, and Islam’s God is the same god, or different. Personally I have noticed the ones that are very strong believers in their religion, thinking that it makes them better than the rest, are the ones who believe that it is a different god.<br>
Not being a follower of any of those religions, I wouldn’t really know.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve read the bible several times, and I’ve had religion study for quite a few years. The Jews Tanakh is the same as the old testament, but IIRC in a different order. And muslims believe in the same god too. I can’t remember the names of the characters, but it was the story of the two brothers, of which one was younger but destined to be the next leader. The father was blind, so the mother came up with the idea to stick sheep hair on the arms of the younger brother. So he could be named the leader. The older brother left with his mother, and he founded what is now called the Islam.</p>

<p>You are to blame for copying your teacher without questioning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Human was meant to rule the earth and have their own chooses, not that god should control every movement and actions.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is the most flawed statement I’ve ever read. There is a ton of evidence that shows that Humans were not the first animals on this planet. Even the idea that Humans were placed on earth as a finishing touch is stupid. The evolution toward the humans we are now has taken millions of years. Even the physical difference between humans now and humans in the middle ages is astonishing. Now we have plenty of food, so we are taller.</p>
<p>I’ve heard people say that we really come from Adam and Eve. By saying so, you can’t deny evolution. Adam and Eve where either white, black, or in between. So only evolution explains why there are different skin colors. But then you ask those people why we aren’t retarded, because we all are products of inbreeding. They say that it didn’t exist back then. But we all are descendants from 2 persons, so it doesn’t matter how many generations are in between.[/quote]<br>
I’am read that about the Muslims in our book to.</p>
<p>Yes, not even the Bible say that humans was the first animals, but say another specie that have controlled so much of the earth as we do today?</p>
<p>Don’t you think God can fix a little problem like inbreed?<br>
According to Bible people live much longer before, but because of something I don’t remember people would not be any older than 120 years, if that true, it must have happen something that change the human.</p>
