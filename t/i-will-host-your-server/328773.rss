    <title>I will host your server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-will-host-your-server/328773</link>
    <description>Wasn&#39;t really sure what section to post this in so if this is incorrect please move it... Anyway, on with the reason of this thread. I have a VPS which isn&#39;t really being used at the moment so it&#39;s just a wasted resource, for the next month (at the very least) I can host somebody&#39;s server - but I have some requirements, don&#39;t bother contacting me if you don&#39;t agree to these or fit any of the descriptions:-

- Server must be stable, I was hosting somebody else&#39;s recently and it kept crashing (not my problem, was their shitty coding) this meant I had to put in more work than I was willing, so I just closed it down.
- I want to receive any donations to the server, at least to cover costs. Then we split anything after the costs 50/50. Money goes to my paypal.
- Server must be active and growing (50players online average is minimum), if you have a lot of players and your server is lagging at the moment this is your solution.
- I want to be an admin (or co-owner) I&#39;ll also have decisions on who becomes a moderator, who gets banned etc, if I think your friend is abusive I&#39;ll just ban them.

Whoever takes up this offer I will also throw in a free domain (.com/.net) for you to put whatever you want on it related to the server, or I&#39;ll just set up a forum on it for you. Any questions ask away... or feel free to contact me via MSN or email  @  anon.of.brother@gmail.com</description>

You’re basically controlling the other person’s server! You’re stealing all of the server donations and controlling the staff and who plays. Let’s not forget it can’t even be coded the way the owner wants it to be. It has to meet your expectations.</p>
<p>So let me elaborate on the stealing donations. You’re basically taking them to <span class="bbcode-b">cover the costs of the VPS</span>. If their donations could cover the cost, wouldn’t they buy their own? This is just a horrible way of stealing someone else’s server to make money.</p>

</aside>
<p>What’s the point in posting if your just gonna be a dick… Anyway, I’ve already used the VPS for the reason I purchased it for. I don’t need to go into what the reason was but I’ve finished with it now so thought I would put it to good use. Yah, and you don’t think I’m really gonna be making much money do you?? Probably won’t even cover costs, but if it does I said I would split it equally which is the decent thing to do.  <span class="bbcode-i">You say ‘making money off other people’ is wrong, even though 99% of peoples income in this world comes from other people. You buy a chocolate bar, your paying money to other people etc, nothing in this world is free… but sometimes you can get off of an initial investment.</span></p>
<p>Oh, and you say this is not an act of kindness, lols maybe not for you but there’s a lot of people here that can’t afford to pay out anything or don’t have the knowledge how to set this up, I’m fairly sure they would find it extremely kind of me to host the server 24/7 with no lag + also get a free domain and web hosting. Whatever though… oh, and sorry if this is against the rules - I didn’t see anything anywhere saying this was disallowed I just didn’t know what section it would fall under.</p>
