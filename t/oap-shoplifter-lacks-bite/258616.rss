    <description>[b]OAP shoplifter lacks bite[/b]

&lt;blockquote&gt;A 70-year-old shoplifter tried to evade capture by biting an arresting officer before realising he&#39;d left his dentures at home.

Pensioner Gustav Ernegger turned on the policeman when he grabbed him as he ran out of a clothes shop in Braunschweig, Germany, after stealing a shirt.

But instead of sinking his teeth into the officer&#39;s arm, he was only able to leave a wet mark from his gums.

Police spokesman Gunther Brauner said: &quot;He tried to bite the officer several times, but had forgotten to put his false teeth in and so was unable to cause him any harm.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>This old bummy guy went into Canadian Tire and stole some shit, my friends that work there tried chasing him down but about 30ft away from the store he turned around and was like “I have AIDS, and I’m bleeding” (he was bleeding)… they just walked back to the store, lol.</p>
