    <description>How would I limit the amount of things that are displayed in like a news list? This is what I&#39;m using to display the news and I want to limit it to 5 to be shown.

[code=html4strict]
&lt;div class=&quot;news&quot;&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;News Headlines&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;newsHeadline&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;?php
                        $query = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT * FROM news ORDER BY id DESC&quot;) or die(mysql_error());
                        while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($query)) {
                    ?&gt;
                    &lt;a href=&quot;news.php?id=&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row[&#39;id&#39;]) ?&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row[&#39;image&#39;]) ?&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row[&#39;title&#39;]) ?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;postDate&quot;&gt;&lt;?php echo $row[&#39;date&#39;] ?&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;article&gt;
                        &lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row[&#39;text&#39;]) ?&gt;
                    &lt;/article&gt;
                    &lt;div class=&quot;readMore&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;a href=&quot;news.php?id=&lt;?php echo htmlspecialchars($row[&#39;id&#39;]) ?&gt;&quot; title=&quot;Read more about this article&quot;&gt;Read more...&lt;/a&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;?php
                        }
                    ?&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;

<p>They have been saying that since 5.3/5.4, there is still no official confirmation. Anthony Ferrara has made some points that the MySQL extension most likely won’t be removed entirely till after PHP 6 (which is a few years away). Too many sites/projects/frameworks use it to use the normal deprecation process. Even WordPress is still using it.</p>
<p>The MySQL extension isn’t even inherently insecure. It’s the bad usage that makes it that way.</p>

</aside>
<p>I know they’ve been saying it for a while now but if people were to start using a different system now it’d make the change a lot easier. Not to mention the use of prepared statements is better than just escaping a string. The bad usage statement is the same for everything in php, or so I believe. PHP gets a bad name because people don’t use it to its full potential, a lot of PHP programmers have the “love it” attitude and their code is sloppy and that’s when they start to leave exploits. Then it comes back as a negative energy towards the language and the people who use it. Or that’s my views anyway.<br>

I was just poking fun, anyway. Don’t take it too seriously.[/quote]</p>
<p>LOL this is the internet. Of course I’m not (or hope I’m not) being overly dramatic about it… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

Anthony Ferrara has made some points that the MySQL extension most likely won’t be removed entirely till after PHP 6 (which is a few years away). Too many sites/projects/frameworks use it to use the normal deprecation process. Even WordPress is still using it.</p>
<p>The MySQL extension isn’t even inherently insecure. It’s the bad usage that makes it that way.[/quote]<br>
I know they’ve been saying it for a while now but if people were to start using a different system now it’d make the change a lot easier. Not to mention the use of prepared statements is better than just escaping a string. The bad usage statement is the same for everything in php, or so I believe. PHP gets a bad name because people don’t use it to its full potential, a lot of PHP programmers have the “fuck it” attitude and their code is sloppy and that’s when they start to leave exploits. Then it comes back as a negative energy towards the language and the people who use it. Or that’s my views anyway.</p>

<p>They have been saying that since 5.3/5.4, there is still no official confirmation.

[/php][/quote]People use it because that's what most code samples from this website use and it's on most PHP/MySQL tutorials online. This could all be easily solved by not using PHP and using a language that doesn't dump all the modules into the global namespace however.
