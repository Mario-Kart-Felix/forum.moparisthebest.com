    <title>Star Wars: Force unleashed</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/star-wars-force-unleashed/228992</link>
    <description>I got the demo of this recently and i&#39;ve been playing with it alot over the last few days and i have to say it looks as if its going to be a great game. The amount of debris and breakable objects that litter your path is amazing and it gives a real sense of realism to the game. With the &#39;Force Push&#39; power you can throw things this way and that and the controls for using the force are simplistic yet effective. Switching between using the force and your lightsaber is almost seamless alot of games say they have accomplished this when clearly they havnt but i do think this one works well. The graphics are intense and so amazingly detailed it is just unbelievable, i found myself just blowing things up just to see them blow up it was quite a spectacle. I will definately be getting this when it is released</description>

              <p>Yeah i downloaded it the day it came out, though tbh i didn’t expect much of it all since i have not played a decent star wars games since the shadows of the empire one on N64.</p>
<p>Anyway yeah, i loved the demo and i’ll probably get it sometime (probably next year) due to all the games coming out from here till the end of 09.</p>
