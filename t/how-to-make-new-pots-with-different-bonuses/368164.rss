    <description>Classes modified-potions.java
difficulty-1/10
This is my first guide so plz dont go to hard on me. I will accept further improvements i could make on my guides. Thanks.


1.Ok so first you want to go into your source files and find potions.java and open that.
2.Press Ctrl+F and search for super str potion or any other potion.
3.Copy All of the super str coding down to where it says break;


It should look something like this.

[sup]case 2440: // super str (4)
if (System.currentTimeMillis() -c.potionDelay &lt; 2000)
return;
c.foodDelay = System.currentTimeMillis(); if (c.inTrade) { c.sM(&quot;You can&#39;t do this in trade.&quot;); return; }
c.potionDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();
c.strPot = true;
c.strPotTimer = 20;
c.abc = c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[2]);
c.cba = c.abc / 10;
c.abc2 = c.cba * 2;
if (c.abc2 &lt;= 1) {
c.abc2 = 2;
}
c.setAnimation(829);
c.playerLevel[2] = c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[2]);
c.playerLevel[2] += c.abc2;
c.sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;+c.playerLevel[2]+&quot;&quot;, 4006);
c.deleteItem(2440, slot, 1);
c.addItem(157, 1);
c.updateRequired = true;
c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
c.sendQuest(&quot;&quot; + c.playerLevel[2] + &quot;&quot;, 4006);
c.strPotTimer = 60;
				c.sM(&quot;You drink some of your strength potion.&quot;);
				c.sM(&quot;You have 3 doses of potion left.&quot;); 
break;


Now i will explain to you some parts of this coding.
The (case 2440) is the code of the potion you are using, so just change it to whatever potion u want to use(item code).

Then the numbers inside the [2] is the skill number you want it to boost up.So for example if u wanted to make a ranging potion u would change it to [4].

And in this code - c.cba = c.abc / 10;  The /10 means it divides the skill level of that person
                                                       By 10.
c.abc2 = c.cba * 2;         Then here it multiplies the number by 2 after divided by 10.

So let&#39;s say the person&#39;s level in str is 99 then it divides it by 10, So then the 99 turns into a 9 then it times it by [2] making the boost +18 in str skill, so you would have 117 strength.

(c.deleteItem(2440, slot, 1);  Here it means it deletes the potion in the form of(4) doses.
 c.addItem(157, 1);               Then it adds the potion in the form of (3) doses. 

So if you wanted to make your own potion you would add the code for form (4) doses in the 2440.
And you would then add your potion&#39;s code in form (3) where the 157 is.

So yes you would then have to put a code for every kind (4)(3)(2)(1) dose of your potion.


Okay and that&#39;s all i need to explain now i will show you a potion code i made myself.


 case 739: // Bravery potion
if (System.currentTimeMillis() -c.potionDelay &lt; 2000)
return;
c.foodDelay = System.currentTimeMillis(); if (c.inTrade) { c.sM(&quot;You can&#39;t do this in trade.&quot;); return; }
c.potionDelay = System.currentTimeMillis();
c.strPot = true;
c.strPotTimer = 20;
c.abc = c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[2]);
c.cba = c.abc / 8;  &lt;--As you can see i changed the 10 to an 8.Making the 99 divide by 8.
c.abc2 = c.cba * 2; &lt;- --And i left it as *2 times by two.So now it gives +24 in str skill.
if (c.abc2 &lt;= 1) {
c.abc2 = 2;
}
c.setAnimation(829);
c.playerLevel[2] = c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[2]);
c.playerLevel[2] += c.abc2;
c.sendFrame126(&quot;&quot;+c.playerLevel[2]+&quot;&quot;, 4006);
c.deleteItem(739, slot, 1);
c.updateRequired = true;
c.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
c.sendQuest(&quot;&quot; + c.playerLevel[2] + &quot;&quot;, 4006);
c.strPotTimer = 60;
				c.sM(&quot;You drink all your Bravery potion!&quot;);
				c.sM(&quot;You have no doses left!&quot;);  
break;               


So i changed the 10 to an 8, and i left the *2 as it was. And 99 divided by 8 was 12 so then it times it by 2. Making it give +24 str  boost. This is also  how u can code your own extreme potions.

And that is the end of the guide thanks for reading!</description>
