</aside>
<p>If you weren’t such a dick and constantly starting arguments with everybody I wouldn’t have the need to mute you. And you still fail to see the point why subscriptions will be opened soon. It’s not for me, it’s not for crooks; It’s for the god damn server, why is it so hard to believe? No matter how friendly I told you to keep it off the global you continued it, it wouldn’t have been a problem if you’d do it via PM or at modroom, you’re constantly ruining everybodies gameplay with your e-rages.<br>
You can voice your opinion, nothing wrong with that, but if you fail to see how things really are, and form your opinion based on outdated info, your own conspiricy theories, and whatever ridiculous reasons you have in your tiny tiny mind, then not. I even said that I can show every months outgoings and incomings via LiveStream if people like you don’t believe my words.</p>
<p>Not to mention it’s up to you to subscribe or not, subscribers won’t get any massive benefits anyway.</p>
<p>EDIT: And what bugs are you talking about? I clearly pointed out in game that I’ve fixed most of them, there’s very few bugs that I know of.</p>

        <p>heres one of the idiots on forum crying : he is called lalund or nasty. u will find all this on forum <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
“Alright so,<br>
this is in no way, shape or form a place to trashtalk printz or his commrades.<br>
This is a place for serious discussion.<br>
Now, being that he is a mod and at the same time the top smither on the game, there are bound to be conflicts.<br>
But, the fact that he doesnt sell stuff to anyone but his team, don’t you think thats harmful for the server?<br>
I mean, a mod is supposed to help the server, not help tank it.”</p>
<p>"You’re not allowed to multilog? Excellent. Are you going to ban multiloggers, or just reset stats?</p>
<p>Worms, Tosh, Cooby, Username and Printz ALL multi-log each others accounts. Constantly. It’s why they’re all have massively high mining, combat or smithing."</p>
<p>“We will take some off the coal they mined(say about 50-75%), because they probably used undetected bots to do it, aswell as multilogging with so many characters they had counts as abusing the system.”<br>
“Reset his level to around 80, and remove 70% of their coal certs (achieved through multi-logging and the certer)? Why do you keep ignoring my other multi-logging questions?”<br>
"Because you guys are the instigators. You constantly talk shit, so people retaliate and talk shit back.</p>
<p>I don’t care, i’ll admit I was flamming you only because your little team started talking shit AGAIN."</p>
<p>"    Why didn’t anyone else use the certers before then? just blame yourself</p>
<pre><code>imo better without
</code></pre>
<p>Everyone did use the certers you fucking idiot. However, not everyone played 24/7 like Printz. Not everyone had a nerdy little team of 6 people multi-logging in the mining guild to get 20k+ certs.</p>
<p>By removing the certer at this stage, you reward people for no-lifing, and punish the more casual players, i.e. 95% of the server."</p>
<p>so like 10 ppl started crying cause me and my team were getting fast to 99 smithing and we had better weapons etc. and from that shit they started talk shit to us …and we started talk shit to them back …so what happened ? we get punished <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> the server is good but the admin nemesis cant take good decisions <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and if go look on forums theres like 10000 topics started against my team …printz , cooby , i got worms, th3 h3ro , username , etc <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> so if u work hard on this server and get fast lvls ppl make alliance against u …they talk shit to u…we dodnt report them and when we talk back shit to them they go report us and we get punished…</p>
<p>so if u wanna play and train hard , get lvls etc and have the best team from server get ready to get flamed , trashed, punished etc <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> if u accept that and u wont talk back to them go and play on this server <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> but i wont let some kids talk shit to me and admin punish me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
if u gonna play legit, 1 admin everyday at mining guild they will still acuse u of using a "Secret bot ! "<br>

        <p>[quote=“th3 h3ro, post:207, topic:424352”]heres one of the idiots on forum crying : he is called lalund or nasty. u will find all this on forum <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
“Alright so,<br>
this is in no way, shape or form a place to trashtalk printz or his commrades.<br>
This is a place for serious discussion.<br>
Now, being that he is a mod and at the same time the top smither on the game, there are bound to be conflicts.<br>
But, the fact that he doesnt sell stuff to anyone but his team, don’t you think thats harmful for the server?<br>
I mean, a mod is supposed to help the server, not help tank it.”</p>
<p>"You’re not allowed to multilog? Excellent. Are you going to ban multiloggers, or just reset stats?</p>
<p>Worms, Tosh, Cooby, Username and Printz ALL multi-log each others accounts. Constantly. It’s why they’re all have massively high mining, combat or smithing."</p>
<p>“We will take some off the coal they mined(say about 50-75%), because they probably used undetected bots to do it, aswell as multilogging with so many characters they had counts as abusing the system.”<br>
“Reset his level to around 80, and remove 70% of their coal certs (achieved through multi-logging and the certer)? Why do you keep ignoring my other multi-logging questions?”<br>
"Because you guys are the instigators. You constantly talk shit, so people retaliate and talk shit back.</p>
<p>I don’t care, i’ll admit I was flamming you only because your little team started talking shit AGAIN."</p>
<p>"    Why didn’t anyone else use the certers before then? just blame yourself</p>
<pre><code>imo better without
</code></pre>
<p>Everyone did use the certers you fucking idiot. However, not everyone played 24/7 like Printz. Not everyone had a nerdy little team of 6 people multi-logging in the mining guild to get 20k+ certs.</p>
<p>By removing the certer at this stage, you reward people for no-lifing, and punish the more casual players, i.e. 95% of the server."</p>
<p>so like 10 ppl started crying cause me and my team were getting fast to 99 smithing and we had better weapons etc. and from that shit they started talk shit to us …and we started talk shit to them back …so what happened ? we get punished <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> the server is good but the admin nemesis cant take good decisions <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> and if go look on forums theres like 10000 topics started against my team …printz , cooby , i got worms, th3 h3ro , username , etc <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> so if u work hard on this server and get fast lvls ppl make alliance against u …they talk shit to u…we dodnt report them and when we talk back shit to them they go report us and we get punished…</p>
<p>so if u wanna play and train hard , get lvls etc and have the best team from server get ready to get flamed , trashed, punished etc <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> if u accept that and u wont talk back to them go and play on this server <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> but i wont let some kids talk shit to me and admin punish me <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
if u gonna play legit, 1 admin everyday at mining guild they will still acuse u of using a "Secret bot ! "<br>
as u can see we are called nerds , retardeds etc and we are the one starting the war ?<br>
i decided to quit. its better this way <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
and btw yes we did multi login cause theres no rule on the forum for that .<br>
so if theres 30 ppl on / 3 = 10 players :)[/quote]<br>
leave my pal username out of this you homo errrrr<br>
and who the hell cares if he doesn’t sell to you noob get  your own shit</p>
