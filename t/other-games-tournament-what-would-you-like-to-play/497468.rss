    <title>&quot;Other Games&quot; Tournament What Would You Like To Play?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/other-games-tournament-what-would-you-like-to-play/497468</link>
    <description>Well since its just generally minigolf for whatever reason, maybe we should try doing a different game? I just put a select few from the Playforia site. We could even use Funorb or other sites like that if you wanted a like Arcanist tournament or something I don&#39;t know its up to you guys. We can just do another minigolf one if you would like, but I would like to see what you all think.

Also feel free to discuss how these should be played and how pairing up players should be took care of etc.</description>
