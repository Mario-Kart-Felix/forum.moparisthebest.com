              <p>Antivirus will not do much really… go to google and type “trend” the first site should say <a href="http://trend.com" rel="nofollow noopener">trend.com</a> click on it. Run a free scan. If it is a virus (most likely spyware) it will detect it. If it is not a virus. You are simply trying to open a process that the system is currently using. (most likely a file that you shouldn’t edit at all)</p>
