    <title>Missing Madeline (sp?)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/missing-madeline-sp/93067</link>
    <description>I know I may be considered a heart less idiot for saying this, but is all this publicity [b][i]really[/i][/b] neccassery? 

I don&#39;t understand why Ronaldo, Beckham and Lampard are pleeing for her return. I&#39;ve had a friend who went missing for 2 weeks, not one mention in the newspapers, let alone millionaires pleeing for his return. 

Another thing, why are the parents asking for yellow arm bands to be worn today? It&#39;s just stupid, and it&#39;s annoying me. To me, it just looks like the parents are begging for some international attention. Get on with it instead of making people wear yellow arm bands.

<p>What about that retard kid who was “brainwashed”</p>
<p>The reason it is so publicised is because she was practically stolen out of her parents arms, and that it could easily happen to any of us.</p>

<p>If she was ransomed, I’m sure they would have asked for something by now.  I reckon she’s dead.</p>
