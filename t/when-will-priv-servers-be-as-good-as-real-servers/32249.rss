    <title>When will priv servers be as good as &#39;real&#39; servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-will-priv-servers-be-as-good-as-real-servers/32249</link>
    <description>ive notice that during the past few months, private servers have been getting more and more advanced. unfortunately, since we can only start with client, we cant access jagex&#39;s server code unless some disgruntled jagex staff leaks it, lol.

so that means that we&#39;ll have to write the server stuff (quests, npcs,skills, minigames etc) all from scratch. even then, private servers are often buggy

at this rate when do u think that priv servers will eb as good as jagex&#39;s todasy?

my guess is at least 3 years.</description>
