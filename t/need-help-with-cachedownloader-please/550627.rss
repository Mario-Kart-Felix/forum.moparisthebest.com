Try right clicking somewhere on the windows scene (whether in a folder or on desktop), hover the “New” option so the tree expands, and then click either “Zip archive” or “WinRAR Zip archive” whichever one shows for you. They’re the same thing.</p>
<p>Now select all the files in your cache, and drop them onto the zip file, it should begin copying them to the zip.</p>
<p>Upload that zip file and change your links accordingly.<br>

I tried twice, there are folders inside the cache, like sprites and what not. Do i have to take those out? I have no idea what could be going wrong.[/quote]<br>
No, you keep those folders, it’s how the cache unpacks. The downloader creates the folder for your cache, then downloads the .zip into the new folder, and then extracts the cache from the zip.</p>

The link auto downloads and I put only the files in the .zip but it still gives me the same message <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
