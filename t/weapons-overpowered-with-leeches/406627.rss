    <title>Weapons Overpowered with leeches!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weapons-overpowered-with-leeches/406627</link>
    <description>If all leaches are on, weapons such as AGS/Claws and all the other rare weapons hit over 90+ Which as you know is unrealistic.

Is there anyway i can stop people from using all the prayers at once?

I know i can just go into item.cfg and change all the power of the weapons, but then that makes them very weak when on there (without prayer)

Any suggestions?</description>
