    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/forever-alone/431539</link>
    <description>Last night i was in my room and my sister walked in and we started having a conversation that went like this:
Sister - Are you looking forward to school tomorrow?
Me - No... yeeaaahh
Sister - Why?
Me - Cause i can see my friends and stuff
Sister - Jacinta?
Me - *sad face* Forever alone...

I said this because she only mentioned one of my friends and it sounding like i didn&#39;t have any, it was the funniest moment all night. Have you ever had a moment where you&#39;ve actually said IRL &#39;Forever alone&#39;? Funny or not, share!</description>

<p>No, you weren’t there. She constantly talked about the little mermaid and I told her politely to be quiet and she wouldn’t listen. I said shutup after the 3rd or fourth try and the teacher flipped a shit on me. Then one day I got so pissed I started kicking her violin (which was in a case). Awe the wonderful memories of 6th grade.</p>

<p>There is this new chick at our school now and basically she’s one of those really nerdy looking kids with braces and stuff, she drinks a lot of coke too. Today one of the school captains which is a mate of my mate comes up and asks us if she can hang with us, this girl is completely weird (not a good weird like a completely strange awkward weird). She was making jokes that no one was laughing at and being contently interrupted by the other 2 in the group, was kind of funny.</p>
<p>Earlier in the morning i mentioned how we had a new kid and my mates like ‘well at least she isn’t a whore’, i laughed so hard it was sad but it was so true. The point is, she’s a forever aloner too. :([/quote]sounds hot give me her #</p>
