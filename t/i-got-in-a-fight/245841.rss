    <title>I got in a fight</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-got-in-a-fight/245841</link>
    <description>Well me and one of my best friends were hanging out at his house. We invited a few more friends over and we were just hanging out. 

He got pissed over something about hell knows what and decks me in the left temple. I&#39;m not saying i&#39;m a huge  guy because I am kind of small but I have wrestled since I was 5 and I am in pretty great shape. I hit him once then choked him until he passed out. I am home now and i just feel bad about it. Any ideas should i call him? or what?</description>

<p>I don’t think he went to kill him, he said he does wrestling. I take it by that he used a submission hold that is utilized in his wrestling, and there is a difference between a choke and a submission choke. A choke will probably kill someone after a while, whilst a submission choke is either a blood choke (pinching the arteries in the neck, i.e the Rear Naked Choke), Air choke (utilizing the trachea, crushing the windpipe, i.e the Gogoplata) or a Strangling choke, i.e the Peruvian Neck Tie. Whilst submission chokes are dangerous, they are actually pretty safe, depending on the type of choke, as in order of power (the quickest to make them fall asleep)<br>

Sounds like you tried to kill him. I mean, why else would you choke someone for so long that they pass out?<br>
[/quote]<br>
I don’t think he went to kill him, he said he does wrestling. I take it by that he used a submission hold that is utilized in his wrestling, and there is a difference between a choke and a submission choke. A choke will probably kill someone after a while, whilst a submission choke is either a blood choke (pinching the arteries in the neck, i.e the Rear Naked Choke), Air choke (utilizing the trachea, crushing the windpipe, i.e the Gogoplata) or a Strangling choke, i.e the Peruvian Neck Tie. Whilst submission chokes are dangerous, they are actually pretty safe, depending on the type of choke, as in order of power (the quickest to make them fall asleep)<br>
Blood &gt; Air &gt; Strangle[/quote]<br>
I put him in a cradle and locked his feet to hold him down. He was in an angry pissy mood. Im pretty sure he wanted to (hurt) me bad…</p>

<p>He got pissed over something about hell knows what and decks me in the left temple. I’m not saying i’m a huge  guy because I am kind of small but I have wrestled since I was 5 and I am in pretty great shape. I hit him once then choked him until he passed out. I am home now and i just feel bad about it. Any ideas should i call him? or what?</p>
