    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-custom-npcs-and-change-npc-attack-rate/222159</link>
    <description>Well I have 2 questions please respond if you can.


I need to know how to make custom npcs like someone called fr33st00fn00b and then add armor onto him and stuff.

Then I need to know how to make monsters attack rate higher. I wasn&#39;t even hit by my kbd at LEVEL 3!!!</description>
