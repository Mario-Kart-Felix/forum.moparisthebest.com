              <p>That happened to me aswell, you’ve got to actually start your own server to play on that. But if you go to: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus</a> to find out about some servers, where it says IP type the IP of the server you want into it and it will hopefully be in! (Some servers wont work for you, just move on and try another one)</p>
