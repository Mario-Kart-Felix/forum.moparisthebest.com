              <p>The nintendo DS has a lithium ion battery, it will not suffer from the memory effect.</p>
<p>Also, so does the IPod. Since running a li-ion battery right down nothing like that will probably do more harm than good, whoever told you that was wrong. (I’m not 100% sure it will hurt it, but it definitely won’t fix any problems).</p>

Did you charge the batteries for 2 days BEFORE you first used the DS? If you buy the DS, and then use it for a little, and THEN charge it, then you just got yourself something called the ‘memory effect’. When a battery gets the memory effect, you’re screwed and you need to buy a new battery. ALWAYS charge a battery for at least one day before you use it for the first time.<br>

technicly thats not true. companys have goten better about sending you things charged. Ive heard with an ipod that if your battery isnt lasting as long as it should,the battery has been messed up. the way to fix this is to keep turning it on every time it shuts off,untill the point the thing wont even turn on. Then charge it. It worked for my psp and for my ipod so i assume it would work for a ds[/quote]ok ill try it</p>

              <p>Err, no. The DS has a little meter that reads the voltage in the battery. Whenever the voltage drops below a certain level, it shuts off (and therefore if you turn it on again, it will immediately shut off again). And the manufacturers NEVER have a precharged battery. Why would they do so? It costs them more money <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
