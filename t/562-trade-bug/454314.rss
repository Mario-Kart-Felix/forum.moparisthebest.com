    <title>562 Trade Bug</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-trade-bug/454314</link>
    <description>I have this trade bug that when a player trades 29+ of a noted item, the other player wouldn&#39;t receive the item.  And if the player has no inventory space left for what the other guy has to trade, the trade will still accept, it wont say &quot;The other player doesn&#39;t have enough inventory space&quot;.  Its not my trade.java or container.java because I already tried replacing it with other sources.  Any help?</description>
