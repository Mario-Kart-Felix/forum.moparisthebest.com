    <title>Help on a few things please... ^_^</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-on-a-few-things-please--/332471</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I am kinda new to this this (yea, I know, go ahead and call me a noob) and I am having difficulty with a few things. I have a really good autospawn.cfg, but they don&#39;t say anything... ^_^ If possible, can someone please post or send me the file that controls what the NPC&#39;s say, but like a pre-made version (I don&#39;t even know what it&#39;s called)? If you do so, please post them all. I have an autospawn.cfg that includes all the NPCs in Runescape. Also, if possible, can you include the shops.cfg too? Thanks so much. Last question. I need to edit my exp multiplier, because the player gets around 4 exp per hit XD. I went into my cleint.java, found combatexp, and changed all the variables, but still nothing changed. Maybe I did something wrong, I don&#39;t know. If you need them, I can post my autospawn.cfg, shops.cfg, and my client.java, but only if you need them to assist me in solving my problem. Thanks a lot for your time, all!!</description>
