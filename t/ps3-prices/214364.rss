    <title>PS3 prices?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ps3-prices/214364</link>
    <description>Well I&#39;ve been wanting to buy a PS3 for ages. Can someone explain how this works?

Thug-life showed me a link that was for an 80GB ps3 that comes with metal gear solid 4, this was priced at $550 which in my currency is £260. 

This is fucking cheap I think because all the consoles I&#39;ve seen are 40gb and are at least £290 without a game. 

The thing is, this console is American and would be useless to use over in the UK because of the weird regional etc etc.


Someone explain to me the prices? Why are the consoles so cheap in America?</description>

              <p>Hmm plus the fact I’m pretty sure you can buy a “Region free” disk.</p>
<p>Though I thought you could not play UK ps3 games on an American console?</p>
