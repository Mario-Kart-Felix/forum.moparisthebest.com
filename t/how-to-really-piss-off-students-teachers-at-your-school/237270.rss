    <title>How to really piss off students/teachers at your school</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-really-piss-off-students-teachers-at-your-school/237270</link>
    <description>Here is a video I made describing how to find the Name of a school server and shut it down, stopping people from accessing and saving their files.

I will test this at school in a few days, however, seeing as my Servers are more secure than the ones at school, I am sure that it will work.

Credits: Mostly me, for spending a while mucking around on the computer finding these things out
Some to Microsoft for making windows
Some to that screen recording program I used.

Don’t really understand how it happened, I think I must have been sitting at a teachers computer.[/quote]<br>
Someone in my school actualy looked over a teacher while he was typing his password and then when he wasnt in the room logged in and went onto youtube. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>You cannot open C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe at my school so I cannot do anything. The USB ports and CD-Drive are disable via BIOS which is password protected so they only way to break into my school network is to open the computer remove the CMOS bettery and then try to use a Live CD and do some things.</p>

Why would you even attempt this? If your school is anything like mine you need to login with your Student ID/library number and the board administrators can see what you’re doing. Don’t try this if you don’t want to be expelled/suspended.<br>
