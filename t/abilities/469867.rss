    <description>The new RS is certainly a piece of work, but I don&#39;t really like it due to the abilities. They make the game more challenging and interactive due to the situation based use of certain abilities, which is amazing. The abilities aren&#39;t as great as I expected, because they aren&#39;t as efficient as I thought they would be. It seems like most of the abilities are for monsters with more health than usual, due to the long cool-down times of most spells. I&#39;ve taken a look at all the spells, and they are really neat; however, they didn&#39;t really perform as great as I thought. 

A couple of builds I thought of were [b]slice-and-dice[/b] and [b]affliction[/b]. There is no official build names for these because I thought of the names due to the certain activities in a fight.

[b]Slice-and-dice[/b]:

[ul][li]Constantly using spells that are at your resource to output the most damage in a short period of time[/li]
	[li]Abilities used should be based on the cool-down (long to short), so there will be a possible chance to use more powerful abilities more than once[/li][/ul]

[b]Affliction:[/b]

[ul][li]Always use abilities that apply damage over a set amount of time[/li]
	[li]The main source of damage is derived from the abilities that have DoTs (damage over time)[/li][/ul]

Even with the builds above, the actual rotation of abilities used should always be tweaked due to variety of gear and monster type, or maybe even personal preference. I&#39;ve tried both builds and I&#39;ve tested different situations and rotations of each build, but I&#39;ve yet to conclude a &#39;good&#39; standing of ability importance. This is just my opinion, because I&#39;m sure other people have adapted to abilities nicely, even if it is due to the type of armor and weapons you use.</description>

I went PKing as a pure ranger (combat level 20) and would just get 1 hit all the time by people my own level, it’s whoever gets their ultimate first. I found it ridiculously annoying and logged off.<br>

Yes, it is nearly as bad as the old one.</p>

<p>Can you see the other players adrenaline bar above their head? If so, when it gets near full use a defensive ability that blocks a percentage of damage, and then stun them so you get some extra time for your ultimate.</p>
