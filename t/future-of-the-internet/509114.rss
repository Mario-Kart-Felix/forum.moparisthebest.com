    <title>Future of the Internet</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/future-of-the-internet/509114</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been curiously thinking about the internet lately, and how far it&#39;s gone within the past 10+ years.  Every so often I come across a site that hasn&#39;t been update in a matter of years, that still uses the same old static html with no good design features or advanced scripting.  With that, where do you see the internet going in the next 10+ years?  Old websites lay in the forgotten remains of times long ago, never to be looked upon again, taking up space that could be used for something else, something more useful.  Right now isn&#39;t the worst of it yet.  What will happen in 10 years, when the sites we are using at this very moment are quite possibly dead, and only visited by a few randoms?  What about 20 years? 30? Just as landfills hold the trash of many years ago, the internet will follow in it&#39;s footsteps.  So much of our lives are on the internet, will our children&#39;s lives be too?  Will they look upon what we have said, and be amazed on how poor our technology was?  Will they want to get rid of the sites we once loved, to make room for the sites they want?  We, right now, are at a awkward age in technology.  Many people of this world right now, were around years before PCs, iPads, etc, so what happens when our children are born into a world that is based around I.T.?  Are sites that we use now, going to be deleted, or are they going to be preserved?  I&#39;m not even talking about the next 20 years now, what will it be like in 1,000 years, when literally EVERYTHING we have come to love on the internet, is absolutely gone?  It&#39;s just utterly amazing to look back at websites and games from 2001, or even sooner, and see how terrible they were.  You might even say they are a waste of space, or you might say they should be preserved for the next generations to wow over such technology.  Everything now is digital.  Back in the day, everything was mechanical.  We don&#39;t study caveman computers, because they simply didn&#39;t have them, but what will the future generations do when we don&#39;t have any real footprints in the world, other than the information on the web and in the cloud?  Yes, we will still leave large footprints on the world, but nowhere near as much as the people of the later generations did: generations that are still living today, but won&#39;t be in the near future?


TL;DR - I guess the point of this is, what do you see the internet looking like in the years to come?  Do you see it as a wasteland of what it once was, or do you see a bright new future?</description>

<p>The concept of looking at a 3D picture is fucking ridiculous to me. The world is already in 3D - if you want to experience that, remove your eyes from the screen in front of you and do something.</p>

              <p>‘The internet’ is too broad a term to make an accurate assumption of. It’s how we communicate, and I don’t think it will ever be removed, just improved upon. It’s like the movies. Been around for years, but we just keep improving them and making them better to fit the times. Will we be looking at projected screens right in front of our face or on glasses to browse the web instead of PC’s? Probably. But the internet I think will always be around in some form.</p>

              <p>I’ve been curiously thinking about the internet lately, and how far it’s gone within the past 10+ years.  Every so often I come across a site that hasn’t been update in a matter of years, that still uses the same old static html with no good design features or advanced scripting.  With that, where do you see the internet going in the next 10+ years?  Old websites lay in the forgotten remains of times long ago, never to be looked upon again, taking up space that could be used for something else, something more useful.  Right now isn’t the worst of it yet.  What will happen in 10 years, when the sites we are using at this very moment are quite possibly dead, and only visited by a few randoms?  What about 20 years? 30? Just as landfills hold the trash of many years ago, the internet will follow in it’s footsteps.  So much of our lives are on the internet, will our children’s lives be too?  Will they look upon what we have said, and be amazed on how poor our technology was?  Will they want to get rid of the sites we once loved, to make room for the sites they want?  We, right now, are at a awkward age in technology.  Many people of this world right now, were around years before PCs, iPads, etc, so what happens when our children are born into a world that is based around I.T.?  Are sites that we use now, going to be deleted, or are they going to be preserved?  I’m not even talking about the next 20 years now, what will it be like in 1,000 years, when literally EVERYTHING we have come to love on the internet, is absolutely gone?  It’s just utterly amazing to look back at websites and games from 2001, or even sooner, and see how terrible they were.  You might even say they are a waste of space, or you might say they should be preserved for the next generations to wow over such technology.  Everything now is digital.  Back in the day, everything was mechanical.  We don’t study caveman computers, because they simply didn’t have them, but what will the future generations do when we don’t have any real footprints in the world, other than the information on the web and in the cloud?  Yes, we will still leave large footprints on the world, but nowhere near as much as the people of the later generations did: generations that are still living today, but won’t be in the near future?</p>
<p>TL;DR - I guess the point of this is, what do you see the internet looking like in the years to come?  Do you see it as a wasteland of what it once was, or do you see a bright new future?</p>
