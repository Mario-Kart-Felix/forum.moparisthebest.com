    <title>Looking for a development team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-development-team/555537</link>
    <description>Hello! I&#39;m looking to start up a new 718 rsps server.

What I need: A team (1-2 Developers, 1 Founder(Because it totally sounds better then owner.)).

What I have: Plenty of steady income cash to host a server with all the bells and whistles.

The main issue most people probably won&#39;t like:

- I&#39;m looking for people who are interested in developing for free because they want to learn or meet like minded people you aren&#39;t getting paid until we start getting donations
which will only happen after release but because we are in development and are aiming towards learning there may never be a release or a release may be far in the future when we all believe we made something extraordinary.

If you are interested in this PLEASE reply to this post or pm me contact details HOWEVER if you are not interested in this please do proceed to flaming so you can provide me with one more thing not to care about...</description>
