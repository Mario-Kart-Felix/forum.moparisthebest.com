Why do you think you should be on the team?:
What position are you going for?
Have you any experience in what position you&#39;re going for, if so how long and proof?:
How long will you be on a day?:
What can you bring to the team?

We currently are looking for all positions.</description>

<p>Exactly so why are you saying no-one good will join if I have no proof of not wanting to be a wannabe leech fag? I have trust in the people who join but by what you are saying is they have no trust in me.</p>

You don’t have proof of any actual development.</p>
<p>Nobody decent will join this.<br>

<p>What do you mean?[/quote]Let me put this in laymen terms</p>
<p>If you don’t prove you aren’t an imbecile wannabe leech you aren’t going to get any developer who actually knows what the heck they are doing.</p>
