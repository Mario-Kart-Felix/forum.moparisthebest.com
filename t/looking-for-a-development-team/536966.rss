    <description>[size=20pt]Unnamed Server[/size]
[size=12pt]A work in progress[/size]
[hr]
[size=11pt]The Story[/size]
[size=9pt]Welcome to our development recruitment thread. This currently unnamed development is a framework in the making, and with the hopes that the end result will be somewhere along the lines of a bench-marked server known for its stability, we are in search of a team to help us develop. Development is expected to be fast-paced and well-organized, with communication and team decision making as the key to the development&#39;s success. With that said, we have some broad specifications for what we&#39;re looking for in terms of recruiting potential developers. Developers must be active and dedicated to the project (By this, we mean active within the development team. Inactive developers will be removed from the team after a certain period of unexcused inactivity passes.), mature and willing to learn alongside the other developers (We don&#39;t expect you to be serious at all times. We&#39;re here to have fun and make something great in the process, so enjoy yourself while on the team; be yourself.), honesty and integrity, and prefer quality over quantity (If you know a way to make a 100 line code snippet do the same thing as/more efficiently in less lines of code, by all means go for it!).[/size]

[size=11pt]The Team[/size]
[size=9pt]The team is currently small and has lots of room for developers to step in and help out. Listed below is the current team, naming its members and role within the development.[/size]

[ul][li]xxxtilllyxxx[list]
[li]Role: Primary Developer[/li]
[/list][/li]
[li]Flame_[list]
[li]Role: Primary Manager[/li]
[/list][/li][/ul]


[size=11pt]The Application Format[/size]

<p>I’m planning on having a team of specific roles, not so much a “large” team. I’ll be having 1, POSSIBLY 2 other source developers, and the rest would be client developers, or forums managers, data collectors, etc.</p>
