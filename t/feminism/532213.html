        <p>Well I couldn’t but help notice on a certain YouTube video that some young lady is so fixated on the world being so feminist. It was almost like she believed that the world was against her or females. So I sat down for a good 5 minutes and came to a conclusion to believe that I have never actually meet or came across someone who was against feminism. Though myself, I don’t like to portray myself as a feminist because I don’t believe in such a fictitious belief to the point where I see males vs females. I see feminism to the point where males were genetically built differently to females to adapt to our environment for the simple fact of survival. An example of this is a study of females brains actually shutting down during sex while males brains stay active, why? Because during the Jurassic times males were the bron, they were the guardians of the village, if you were getting down and dirty with your lady then someone would need to be on alert if any dinos came roaring in. But seeing from this point of view feminist would take that and say its sexist? Why? Well this isn’t a fair test but if I were to take 500 middle aged ladies and 500 teenage ladies I can guarantee you that a bigger percentage of the teenage side would be feminist, again why? Well we all know that teenagers need a sense of recognition, a sense of wanting to be heard, a sense of starting the new trend. You put together the results and see what you get, a raging teenaged school girl who probably has a perfect life but has to find the next best thing to rant about online in hopes that she’ll get more twitter followers, facebook likes or youtube comments.</p>
<p>I don’t know, its just a small rant from myself and just a small portion of perspectives on my wide variety of beliefs. Please do not take this the wrong way though, I am all for world equality its just my rant on those we believe in things that are quite fiction. I might also state that all statistics and ideas from my rant above are all speculation, no experiments or recordings were taken in place to back up my ‘proof’. I’d like to think that we can have a civil discussion on different sides of the story which is what I am aiming to look for, your opinion. So yeah, comment below your opinion on feminism or feminist, i’d be more than happy to debate any bull shit we can both come up with.</p>
<p>If anyone was wondering where I got this from it was actually from Robin Thickes music video called blurred lines.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t say I’m against the tenets that underpinned original feminism (i.e., universal suffrage), but modern feminism is a bit of a joke. Every other word I read these days seems to be ‘misogyny’, ‘sexist’, and varieties thereof. Current feminists, in my opinion, are more QQ and less pew pew unlike their predecessors.</p>
<p>Also, I just get sick of hearing ‘privilege’ and so on. Every time I hear ‘check my privilege’ and similar phrases I go and check my privilege – in the mirror. And frankly I like what I see.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe teenagers have more feminist views because they want to be heard but because what they are being introduced to. Women are being shown stronger female characters in the media which is causing them to want to relate and follow those values and ideas. They see movies like Iron lady or the Alien series where the protagonist are more aggressive and forward, they want to reflect that.</p>
<p>Women’s rights and feminism has been growing since the end of world war II after women were given the right to work, to move away from their “home maker duties”. Despite what you say about the building values of feminism, females are still below males in work places and status. However, women have also become more open to manipulation which gives them power but not how they think they deserve it. Until women are happy with their status in the world i don’t think feminism will disappear, it will only get bigger.</p>
<p>I Understand that by nature men are suppose to be the masculine being who protect their mates. Though, considering evolution and the way we’re moving away from nature and toward technology, don’t you think the roles are going to change? Society has introduced a new era for women’s rights, and women aren’t going to throw that increasing power away so soon.</p>
<p>Say what ever you like about my opinion, but that is all it is. Considering this forum is over run by males, i don’t think you’re going to accept my view. However, for this reason i would rather you not target me as a feminist because i’m for equality in many different areas not just gender equality.</p>

        <p>I don’t agree with that first statement but as I have mentioned speculation which I believe is both of our point of views. I also thought about a small portion of history and I did realize the origins and happenings of the actions around ww2 in which I just assumed things were actually coming to an equilibrium right now. I don’t know what goes around where you live but where I am everyone gets the same pay check (depending on your job description yes), the same job experience opportunities etc, maybe I should have mentioned that. Evolution, I like to think humans have completed evolution, I think the word you are looking for is adapt or adaption but yes I completely agree with that though if you keep an open mind you’ll start to realize that the older men who had that sort of viewpoint aren’t around anymore and that our community is slowly building up its equality, which it is and you can see this all over social networks. I believe that is another perk that has come with the adaption. Amy, we are like Freud and Rogers, we are probably never going to agree or have the same view point on anything. I admit myself that its all speculation and can be wrong but judging by that last paragraph you wrote that you don’t seem to think you’re wrong at all? I have to say there is no right or wrong, this isn’t something we can Google to find an answer. For subjects like these it’s always going to be self discrepancy and debatable with others.</p>
<p>Sorry for the lack of paragraphs, I like to type as fast as possible.</p>

        <p>I’m not quite sure about what you mean by your first statement.</p>
<p>The main movement of women’s rights happened after WWII, the being of women’s liberation was introduced by the suffragettes in the early 1900s. I believe we’re looking toward a fourth wave movement of women’s rights and equality.</p>
<p>Discrimination happens everywhere, you might not see it but it is happening. There are laws to prevent discrimination but that does not stop it from happening.

Don’t try bull shit a bull shitter Amy because I don’t know if this is just me but it seems you’re holding a grudge (for what? idk) and have to go against everything I am saying, sure you have your beliefs but it just so happens to be everything against what I have said.</p>
<p>Also as I’ve said many times, I’m not against feminism but the main point of this topic is to bring up the thought about how feminism is being overseen as black vs white, obama vs syria etc (no pun or relation intended, honestly) When honestly, there really is next to no discrimination against women. But yes if you read I had already stated that it may be different where you live but I’ve been to Australia many times and I’ve never witnessed such a thing.</p>

<p>I’m not “bull shitting” you, and i am not holding a grudge against you for anything however it appears that you’ve become aggressive toward me for some unknown reason. Yes, i have my views and opinions on things, but just because they’re the opposite of yours doesn’t mean i’m out to get you. Do you think everyone with opposing beliefs to yours is holding a grudge?

<p>There is discrimination against women all over the world, yes first world countries are trying to stop it and some have succeeded but others haven’t. You see sexual harassment happening all the time in work places, yes, it happens to males but more so reported by females. Just because you don’t witness something that does not mean it isn’t real or happening, it seems like a very close minded way to think about it.</p>
<p>Let the sexist comments commence by the looks of the previous comments.</p>
<p>I don’t understand how you think women have less responsibilities then men, please elaborate.</p>
