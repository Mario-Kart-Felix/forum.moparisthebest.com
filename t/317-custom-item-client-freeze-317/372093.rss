    <title>[317] Custom Item (Client Freeze) [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-custom-item-client-freeze-317/372093</link>
    <description>Okay, my models are ranged 16003 - 16024, and whenever I try to spawn one (ids 18381 - 18395) my client freezes, when I put the models between the 13000 area they showed up as objects and didn&#39;t work correctly. I need to know what to put the models at, cause I know the itemIDs aren&#39;t bad, the modelIDs are just taken! What range should I use? There are 22 models, including all female, male, and ground models. Just give me a range of IDs, that&#39;s all I ask.</description>
