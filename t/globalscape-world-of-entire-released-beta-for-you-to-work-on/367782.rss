    <description>[center] GlobalScape

The World Of Entire Begins
http://www.mediafire.com/?4kei5xj53sdafp9

First here goes the credits-

Bakatool - Guardian-15%
jennipher11-Source Base - 15%
Shardyboy (me) - Re - Creation Cleaned - 70%

Thanks Guys - Anyway heres the ServerGlobalScape is a huge Multi-player online adventure game created by shardyboy, My base is project Guardian an old classic base ive used and cleaned out and coded from scratch.Its really stable i used my own syi and currently holded 300+ players! So im going to create a great economy also make the prices correct not like other servers where whip is like 50m, on this its obviously roughly around 3m-3.2m just an example showing its similiar to Runescape.Im aiming to have it very similiar to  RS i know it wont be perfect to runescape but im taking ideas from it.

We currently have Perfect Npc V&#39;s Player and also Perfect PVP combat in wilderness.Theyr&#39;e is wilderness levels, training on this server is perfect and its a challenge.All the monsters and citizens are roughly in the same place as Runescape also the drops are similiar just abit better and easier.

Currently have no working skills just yet im working on them as im also going to take my time creating them to perfection.So its basic at the minute

Bringing Classics Back!
