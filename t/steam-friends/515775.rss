    <description>Hello again!

So I&#39;m having a little bit of trouble. I live in Germany, but I speak English and not much German. I have no friends that play on steam, and the Germans that do talk on black ops 2 are always bickering about something.. &quot;You suck&quot; &quot;Noob gun&quot; &quot;I will fook your mother&quot; &quot;Fook you&quot;.. My question is, are there any american-in-Germany clans out there? How can I make friends that are american on steam..?</description>

<p>So I’m having a little bit of trouble. I live in Germany, but I speak English and not much German. I have no friends that play on steam, and the Germans that do talk on black ops 2 are always bickering about something… “You suck” “Noob gun” “I will fook your mother” “Fook you”… My question is, are there any american-in-Germany clans out there? How can I make friends that are american on steam…?</p>
