    <description>                                          DragonGuild

Team Needed:

-Client Developer
-Command Editor
-Skills Editor
-Webclient Creator
*Hoster
*IP Creator
-Sprites Manager

If you would like to work with Xele Ltd. on our newest game, DragonGuild, here is some information about the jobs.

Client Developer
	You may develop a client with all of the newest items. You will not be editing sprites or frames such as the inventory color/background. You will not be making this into a Webclient. For the image, it will need to say,&quot;DragonGuild&quot;. You may choose a background. The way the person speaks, for example when someone speaks, it is a different color. It cannot be any of the following:

Flash1
Flash2
Flash3
Dark Colors

Your reward can be chosen. When you complete your job, you may then be asked from various awards but to only choose from one.

Command Editor
	Your job as a Command Editor is to make sure that all of the players cannot type commands. This is a simple task although may take a while. Before you choose this job, you may want to think of how long it will last you. Make sure all the commands are gone. Your reward can be chosen. When you complete your job, you may then be asked from various awards but to only choose from one.

Skills Editor
	For this job, you will be making all skills possible. Therefore, making these all work in a proper manner. Make sure you can get XP from all the skills given. Your reward can be chosen. When you complete your job, you may then be asked from various awards but to only choose from one.

Webclient Creator
	You will be developing a webclient for the server. The Client Developer will be your best friend. As soon as the Client Devlepor is done, then he will upload the client, I will download it, approve it, and send it to you. You will then make it into a webclient. I will supply the links to be give at the top and all other information. Your reward can be chosen. When you complete your job, you may then be asked from various awards but to only choose from one.

*Hoster
	When the server is finally complete, I will need you to run the server 24/7. This is the biggest job yet so the reward will vary from the others. This is a simple task but how long can you keep your computer online?

*IP Creator
	This is probaly one of the easiest jobs. All you have to do is get a basic IP for DragonGuild. I suggest NO-IP. Its free but, If you can pay for it that would be great and your reward would be the greatest. YOUR COMPUTER MUST BE ON 24/7. MAKE SURE NO-IP IS UP WHEN YOUR COMPUTER IS.

Sprites Manager
	Now, for your job. When the client is completed, I will send it to you and you will be editing things in the Sprites folder. This isn&#39;t a quick 2 Minute job! I need you to edit almost everything. Since the server is going to be one of the best, its your job to make it look the best. Your reward will vary from the others.


If you would like to apply for any of these jobs, please send an E-Mail to the owner of DragonGuild at:
                     Dragon-Guild@hotmail.com
