<p>^^ As said, very incorrect. xxjutxx simply quoted info and stole pics, which can still be found at <a href="http://kaitnieks.serveris.lv/a/a/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://kaitnieks.serveris.lv/a/a/</a> (kaitnieks other server)</p>
<p>And before even thinking about rs cheating history, you need to at least read the blackbook. Grab a coffee, it’s a long read. <a href="http://www.fellowes.co.nr/blackbook6.chm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.fellowes.co.nr/blackbook6.chm</a></p>

              <p>I myself joined Kaitnieks a LONG time ago, like a month after RS2 cam out. I first heard the name Kaitnieks when i was searching for RuneScape cheats and got Xx_Jutt_xX’s site, a site that all original cheaters have to go to if they can actually find it. Xx_Jutt_xX was part of the original dupe that Kaitnieks took part in, he posted pics of the crackers and p hats duped, and I was intrigued and thought of kaitnieks as a savior. The site linked to Kaitnieks, but I only went there a few times. Then I found Fridays site, and learned some basic scripting in SCAR, then started going to Kaitnieks, and saw Mopar and saw how good he was at scripting and other stuff, and adverted his site in his sig along with that acronym for mopar that I thought was pretty sweet, so I came, made an acc, and then left. I quit RS for a while, came back and Kaitnieks was about to shut down. I stayed and watched a legacy die, it was hard for all of us. Then when Kaitnieks’ site died he linked to RaW’s site, <a href="http://autoruneltd.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">autoruneltd.co.uk</a> saying that he trusted him and that he’s coming out with Autorune 2. I went, then read up about all the scams he did before I joined the community, and to think, I would have bought the damn program! So I whois’d his site, gave some of the info to the people who bought the program (like poor lemonparty) and left. Well, from there, I saw Taios and thought she was uber cool so stayed at her site, and then went to MOPAR to post a little bit under an acc name Fuez666. Then I left again, cam backe, Taios’ site is now leech proof almost, and I can’t get back in because they won’t respond, but I came to Mopar, made this acc, and I’ve been coming here almost everday ever since. THAT’S how I joined Mopar.</p>

I joined because I got ip banned from Sythe because my brother started spamming my account. I had heard of Mopar, and signed up because it was known to be better than Sythe. Today I know that is true, and I will never try to proxy my way into that <span class="bbcode-b">scam</span> infested site as long as I live. Add ip banned from another Rs Cheating communtiy for no apparent reason/ your brother messed with your account to the poll.<br>

Fixed.<br>
Sythe is full of scammers.[/quote] Yes, they gotta big scam problem. I have yet to see a major scam problem in Mopar.Mopar is my e-home.</p>

<p>I joined because I got ip banned from Sythe because my brother started spamming my account. I had heard of Mopar, and signed up because it was known to be better than Sythe. Today I know that is true, and I will never try to proxy my way into that <span class="bbcode-b">scam</span> infested site as long as I live. Add ip banned from another Rs Cheating communtiy for no apparent reason/ your brother messed with your account to the poll.</p>

Sythe is full of scammers.</p>

<p>After that everyone(or some anyways) headed to <a href="http://autoruneltd.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">autoruneltd.co.uk</a> because that is where kaitnieks linked us to. Many of us decided that it was obviously a scam, and we couldn’t take the amount of spammers/flamers/scammers on that forums so we furthur split up. Some went to this site, some went to <a href="http://saradomin.net" rel="nofollow noopener">saradomin.net</a></p>
<p>I went to <a href="http://saradomin.net" rel="nofollow noopener">saradomin.net</a> but it was getting rediculous because Abyssal(the owner) dissappeared and it was basically all shit. I was in the irc, mopar told me to join here, I did… And here I am.</p>
<p>Now, the reason I joined kaitnieks site was originally for runescape “hacks” and free stuff, but within days I matured a lot and started to become part of the community. It was the first forum I ever posted more then 2 posts on.[/quote]<br>
wow, that’s like almost my story, only i found moparisthebest on <a href="http://sythe.org" rel="nofollow noopener">sythe.org</a> when i was looking for moparscape…</p>
