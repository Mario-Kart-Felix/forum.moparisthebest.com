    <title>NPC trouble</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-trouble/260568</link>
    <description>This NPC help is for Frog Princess lol. I went into autospawn.cfg and removed here and then relocated and compiled to server. Now she keeps appearing in her old spot as well as her new one. I have searched my whole source base for her ID number, name, old coordinated, and still nothing. 

P.S My source is Allstars</description>
