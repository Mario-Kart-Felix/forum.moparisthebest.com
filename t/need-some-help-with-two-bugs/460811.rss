    <description>First i wanted to say. YES i have searched on Google so dont say i should do that. When i search i dont find the problem i have.

Source: Impozzes (InsidiaX base)

1. When you try to open the SkillCape shop with cash in your inventory the client freezes. But it doesnt freeze when you have your cash in the 24th slot. (or is it the 28th... I mean the last one...)

2. Duplication glitch. Somehow when you click &quot;Save Game&quot; Drop the item you want to dupe. Attack monster. Close client. Then login to the account, you will have the item you dropped on the ground and the one in your inventory. I know how i can delete the &quot;Save Game&quot; button. But is is possible to make it Automaticly save all players when server shuts down?</description>
