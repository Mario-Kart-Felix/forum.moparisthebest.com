    <title>Where to start</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-to-start/70919</link>
    <description>Hey ive created a couple of auto talkers in my time and now im wanting a bit more of a challenge seeing as i got them down packed. 

If you want to check them out just go the free scripts and check out my (aka WesT-LocaL&#39;s) auto talker .

Now the problem is im thinking about making a power cutter as a next script. I was wanting to knwo if this is a wise move and also where to start.
There are so many ways to go about making one and i wanted to get the basics down then expand on the script.
So what id like to know is what you rekon my power cutter shoudl include (eg login, color finding, anti ban etc) and what functions i should use from scar/srl, such as what color finding techniques are the best and all that sorta thing.

Thanks and hopefully i can produce somthing half decent.</description>
