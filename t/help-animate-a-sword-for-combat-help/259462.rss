    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-animate-a-sword-for-combat-help/259462</link>
    <description>Well the models i have made work fine in a private server. but when i tried to attack something the sword dissapeared and it was just my fist punching the monster. then after i was done attacking the monster the sword was back in my hand. can some show me or lead me to a tutorial explaining how to animate wepons for combat?

thanks</description>
