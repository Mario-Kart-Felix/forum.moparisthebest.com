    <title>Creating Databases [MySQL]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-databases-mysql/478041</link>
    <description>I&#39;m really new to web development &amp; MySQL and try&#39;d to create a database on my own, it went horribly wrong and nothing was loaded from my databases lol. If someone would take the time to show &amp; explain to me how to create a database for each one of these classes , I&#39;d really appreciate it. So here we go  :cool:

In the first class I was simply just establishing database connection :

http://pastie.org/5659358

The Second class was for handling donations and here that is :

http://pastie.org/5659364

The third class was just suppose to handle just the general login of any user and here that is:

http://pastie.org/5659366

Lastly the final class which is very similar to the third is basically to load moderators and administrators and here is the code for that:

http://pastie.org/5659368

I&#39;m not sure if this allowed in this section but I&#39;d like I said before I&#39;d really appreciate if someone took the time to help me with this, Thanks in Advance  :D</description>
