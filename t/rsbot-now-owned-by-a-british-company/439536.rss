    <title>RSBot now owned by a british company?</title>

    <description>This seems highly irrational as Jagex would take legal action against them quite fast wouldn&#39;t they?

Exactly.  The gameplay matters the most, and considering java isn’t meant to make games Xbox games, they need to be simpler.  I’m sure Java could easily be used, however the way they’re doing it is clearly wrong.  Not many people were transferring to other games like they thought, and even if they did, they would still play RS, so I have no idea where they were getting that from.[/quote]</p>

<p>no sadly it is now closed source to make it legal. they also assure that there isnt any malicious code in it b/c if there was they would get jail time. someone cloned rsbot b4 or after the nuke idk when but there is a github with all the source code from the old rsbot. the link is somewhere but idk if i have it.<br>

<p>Fyi, reverse engineering isn’t what’s illegal about what they are doing. Jagex can reverse engineer their bot all they want, who cares. It’s not like it’s their intellectual property, at any rate. All they are doing is using portions of Jagex’s code, which can actually be proved <span class="bbcode-i">by</span> reverse engineering it. And, at the end of the day, powerbot is profiting on Jagex’s intellectual property, in and of itself is more of a crime than any of the programmers committed.[/quote]Smartest comment from you  so far  in 2012 &lt;3</p>

<p>Jagex ruined their own game for profit.[/quote]<br>
Exactly.  The gameplay matters the most, and considering java isn’t meant to make games Xbox games, they need to be simpler.  I’m sure Java could easily be used, however the way they’re doing it is clearly wrong.  Not many people were transferring to other games like they thought, and even if they did, they would still play RS, so I have no idea where they were getting that from.</p>

no sadly it is now closed source to make it legal. they also assure that there isnt any malicious code in it b/c if there was they would get jail time. someone cloned rsbot b4 or after the nuke idk when but there is a github with all the source code from the old rsbot. the link is somewhere but idk if i have it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Fyi, reverse engineering isn’t what’s illegal about what they are doing. Jagex can reverse engineer their bot all they want, who cares. It’s not like it’s their intellectual property, at any rate. All they are doing is using portions of Jagex’s code, which can actually be proved <span class="bbcode-i">by</span> reverse engineering it. And, at the end of the day, powerbot is profiting on Jagex’s intellectual property, in and of itself is more of a crime than any of the programmers committed.</p>
