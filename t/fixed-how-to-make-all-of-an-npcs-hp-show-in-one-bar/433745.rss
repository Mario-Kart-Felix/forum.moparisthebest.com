    <title>[FIXED] How to make all of an NPC&#39;s HP show in one bar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fixed-how-to-make-all-of-an-npcs-hp-show-in-one-bar/433745</link>
    <description>I recently changed my RSPS coding base from Hybrid PvP to one called InsidiaX.

One Hybrid PvP, when I change the amount of HP an NPC has, it just adds it onto the HP bar, thus; 
-When Corporeal Beast has 100 HP, the HP bar depletes very quickly as I used a strong player to kill it, and it had just the one HP bar.
-When Corporeal Beast has 3,000 HP, the HP bar takes much longer to empty as I attack it, yet it still has just the one bar, and it doesn&#39;t refill when I finish the first one off.

THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO HAPPEN ON MY NEW BASE ^^^^

However, when I set Corp&#39;s HP to 3,000 on my new base, it goes through multiple HP bars that keep on replenishing as I finish the last one off. 

I would like to know how to change this so all 3,000 HP is displayed in one HP bar, not 5 (or whatever the number of bars it is)


Another way of looking at this is that I would like to increase the maximum HP allowed in one HP bar (if that&#39;s what the problem is. It may just be that there is code somewhere to tell it to split into more that 1 bar, I don&#39;t know :s)


As I got no response on my last topic, I would be VERY happy if I got a helpful answer on this :)



Thanks so much in advance, 

Idznak :3

EDIT:

I found out how to fix it, I had to follow this guide 

http://google.com/runescape-development/google/tutorials/62427-npc-hp-bar-fix-stop-repeatedly-refilling.html


If anyone gets an error that the variable &quot;misc&quot; isn&#39;t found after adding the HP fix into NPC.java, change the &quot;m&quot; to a capital on &quot;misc.getCurrentHP(HP, MaxHP, 100));&quot;

so it reads

[code]//HP Bar Fix by Unborn
str.writeByteS(Misc.getCurrentHP(HP, MaxHP, 100));
str.writeByteC(100);[/code]


It doesn&#39;t like &quot;misc&quot; with a small &quot;m&quot; :P</description>
