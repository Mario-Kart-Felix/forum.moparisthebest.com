Uhhhh, wtf? Why would you post this? You answer this for a topic looking for coders…<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>umm because its a development team forums. im looking for a development team theres no difference if i post a Q/A about my self for a server on my own topic then posting a Q/A on someone else’s topic[/quote]Yes there is. This isn’t a profiling section, it’s a development section. There is not development in this thread. Before boasting about your justification on what you can and can’t post, might I suggest looking at the rules?</p>
<p>[quote=“Taharok, post:1, topic:297296”][ul][li]Your need to provide some sort of evidence that your development team will be successful (ie, pictures).[/li]<br>
[li]Your work must be your own. Stealing other people’s work is unacceptable and isn’t tolerated here.[/li]<br>
[li]Absolutely no advertising is allowed in this section. It is simply for recruiting people for your development team. You may discuss development here with your team, as well as discuss other features you plan on developing.[/li]<br>
[li]If you are going to post a website, you <span class="bbcode-b">must</span> first get it approved with an Administrator or a Global Moderator. Failure to do this will result in an infraction for advertising.[/li][/ul][/quote]</p>
