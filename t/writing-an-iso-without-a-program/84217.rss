    <title>Writing an ISO without a program?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-an-iso-without-a-program/84217</link>
    <description>Is it possible? I&#39;m on my only computer with a CD writing drive and its a limited account (sad, I know) and I need to write an ISO to a CD but I can&#39;t find any programs I can do it with. Is there a way I can do it without downloading anything of Rebooting in safe mode, go into my admin accoutn, change acc type, etc. or any hacks?


EDIT: I think I&#39;m going to try and put an old CD ROM drive that I have on my other computer and just use Nero to burn it. Still if anyone knows how to do what I just posted, I would really like to know.</description>

operable program or batch file.</code></pre>
<p>It could be because I fhked up my environmental variables or what ever there called.</p>
<p>EDIT: Never mind, Javacisnotrecognized helped. And this worked too! Thanks a bunch, Kubuntu here I come![br][size=1]Posted on: April 24, 2007, 09:00:45 AM[/size][hr]You have to be an admin to access that feature… Damnit.</p>
