    <title>Does General Programming need our help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-general-programming-need-our-help/51129</link>
    <description>I believe the General Programming section is in dire need of help.  Too many people are learning (and posting for that matter) Visual Basic code, which is probably because it is easy to learn as a beginner language, but is NOT where a newbie programmer should start.  It teaches sloppy coding, and is completely unrelated to other programming languages, and, I believe, shouldn&#39;t be learned at all.  I believe that we, being the moderately-to-advanced programming crowd, should promote the learning of python, Java, or even BASIC as a beginning language.  Do you agree?</description>

              <p>I have books on many coding languages and i read and look at them from time to time never really bothering to get far into that coding language. But i find the more advanced coding languages relate to eachother while visual basic looks very sloppy and nothing like others. And if i wanted to start coding i would try at C++, C or java. Because they teach good coding techniques making easier to learn other languages later.</p>

<p>Bad example. I got scripting and programming languages mixed up, and again I didn’t understand the author and you appear, Mopman. Maybe I should just keep my mouth shut. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>SCAR is an interpreter. I mean saying a SCAR script is a programming language is like saying SCAR is like VB, Delphi or many more. The difference is SCAR just uses the Pascal syntax, Delphi is basically a form Pascal, same as VB is a form of the BASIC language.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I highly recommend messing with SCAR if you plan to actually move on to a Pascal language, as it gives you a good feel of what Pascal is like. No, you can’t copy + paste your SCAR script into Pascal and expect it to work but you know how the syntax works, like if you wanted to assign the string faj to the variable jaf, you would use jaf := faj, and you probably won’t be confused, as it would take a week before your making your own SCAR scripts with no questions on SCAR’s syntax. I mean common, SCAR even has a little popup window telling what you need to type next(don’t get me wrong on this one either, I love it).</p>
<p>Again, I’m sorry I confused scripting and programming languages, but comparing SCAR and VB isn’t possible as it isn’t a programming language, it’s a scripting language. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>Actually, I think that makes it a scripting language <span class="bbcode-i"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">by definition</a></span>.</p>
<p>Pascal still isn’t a terrible language to learn. It’s simple enough, and just because its not object-oriented doesn’t mean it’s not a valid choice.</p>

So your 100% right, even school systems can see that VB is not the way to start leaning.</p>

Faster than java? /glares at .net framework and runs away<br>
It can’t be easier, its basically the same thing.<br>
Command line? JDK is the Java Development kit - <span class="bbcode-b">kit</span>, not environment, thats where IDEs and such come in.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>After using Java and C#, I gave up on Java because C# was just…easier. It was also a TON faster. They are not the same thing.<br>
I have actually tried the Java IDE from Sun…it was a hellish nightmare. Has anyone here actually tried it? It was SOOOOOOOO slow!!! I figured it would be alot easier than other software. It took nearly a minute to get a context menu to pop up. It used all 512mb of ram and 1024mb of virtual ram i had. i’m not sure if this is a bug or if this is just java but it’s slow. This was on a 2.0ghz AMD Sempron with 512mb of ddr sdram.</p>
<p>If it seems like I am totally bashing java then I apologize. I do give them credit because most of their syntax is awesome and it helped create C#.[/quote]<br>
Just try a different IDE? :rolleyes:</p>

<p>After using Java and C#, I gave up on Java because C# was just…easier. It was also a TON faster. They are not the same thing.<br>
I have actually tried the Java IDE from Sun…it was a hellish nightmare. Has anyone here actually tried it? It was SOOOOOOOO slow!!! I figured it would be alot easier than other software. It took nearly a minute to get a context menu to pop up. It used all 512mb of ram and 1024mb of virtual ram i had. i’m not sure if this is a bug or if this is just java but it’s slow. This was on a 2.0ghz AMD Sempron with 512mb of ddr sdram.</p>
<p>If it seems like I am totally bashing java then I apologize. I do give them credit because most of their syntax is awesome and it helped create C#.</p>

              <p>This is turning very stupid very quickly. In the spirit of actually addressing the topic:</p>
<p>I’ll admit that I don’t like Visual Basic. The code is ugly, it’s non-intuitive to me, it’s tied to a specific IDE (which I hate), it’s slow, it’s buggy, it’s easy to crack, and running programs on a computer that didn’t compile them is a one-way ticket to DLL hell.</p>
<p>Those things said, I think it does more good than harm. First off - however corrupt, it is a flavour of BASIC. It’s impossible for me, whose first programming was done on a Texas Instruments calculator, to bash BASIC. BASIC of any kind is a good introduction to fundamental programming concepts. Maybe not the most current fad/paradigm and maybe not the best way of doing any particular thing, but you can learn those things later. Another advantage is that a school (remember our target demographic here) is more likely to teach a BASIC-centered intro programming class than anything else.</p>
<p>The thing that makes Visual Basic stand out over ‘normal’ BASIC is that it’s a RAD (visual) language. That gives it all kinds of advantages for the beginning programmer. A beginner isn’t going to be thrilled by “Hello World” printing once in a command line - but what if your program has a big red button that pops up a message box that you can press over and over again? Seeing very clearly that their program <span class="bbcode-i">does</span> something in the way they’re used to (i.e., graphically) is proof that something is coming out of their work.</p>
<p>With Java, making this program is a pain in the ass. As a teacher, you have the choice between teaching them to be dependent on a builder from day one or explaining not only the concepts of objects and instances, but also the vagaries of about 5 Swing classes, modal interfaces, and the event-based programming paradigm. Joy.</p>
<p>With Visual Basic, you show them how to drag a button onto the grey box, double-click it, and make a single API call.</p>
<p>I even use Visual Basic myself when I just want to throw something together quickly. Some of my dinky hack projects (read: key generators and game trainers) use RAD languages. They’re also good for UI prototyping (not that anyone here cares).</p>
<p>I’d like to quote Mopman here, since he just about nailed it:</p>

It is actually fairly object oriented - not fully, but it certainly uses the basic concept a lot better than a lot of you manage to pull off in Java.</p>
<p>In my opinion, porting BASIC to the Windows GUI was a marvellous idea… I don’t know if any of you are old enough to have had a C64 or indeed anything earlier (nor am I really, I just got given random family members shit when i was a kid :p) but they almost all came with some form of basic - because anyone could learn how to knock code together if they were so inclined - not pretty code, but code that looked more inviting to a newcomer than C or asm.</p>
<p>You have to understand that this forum is largely populated by runescape players (read: 13 year olds) and they are just going to be starting out their journey to become an awesome coder, so they want the same experience C-BASIC gave c64 users in their day (was it called C-BASIC? I’m sure it had a better name but i can’t remember) - so they turn to VB.</p>
<p>Anyway yeah, to each their own blah blah blah go and program some 1337 java applets if that makes your penis feel larger.</p>
<p>EDIT: oh yeah, and i’d say a vb programmer has MORE change of being able to progress to other languages. A programmer is a programmer, once you have the basic thought processes down you can pick up any language you need to get the job done, they’re all the same really.</p>
