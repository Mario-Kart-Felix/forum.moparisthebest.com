    <title>Pvp timer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pvp-timer/350228</link>
    <description>Mmk Well, i wanna try coding out but my friend is saying i&#39;ll let you try to code something for my server and if its good i&#39;ll put it in. So he said try coding pvp timer and he told me its easy. So i asked him where do i start and he said i have to figure it all out myself. But since i&#39;m new i have no idea. Can anyone tell me how to do it?

I want to know how to add a timer thats like runescape, like if your in a fight and you try to run away and your in the safe zone you have a timer thats 10 seconds long and during that 10 seconds your opponent can attempt to kill you. If you survive that 10 seconds your completely safe until your in another fight.

Enough info or not?</description>
