<p>If you want some more examples: Spreading viruses via a client, DDoSing other servers/paying people to DDoS other servers, using data given on the server to access users personal information (in the cases they use similar passwords or stuff like that on other servers/sites as well)</p>

<p>It has to be done on a case-per-case basis. I have attacked my own server on numerous occasions to test it’s protection and how packet flooding is handled but if DDoS as a whole is a bannable offence then someone could find that I attack my own server and I could be banned.

No, testing your own server/network is <span class="bbcode-b">never</span> malicious; there is also precedent for this.</p>
<p>Why would I PM someone who is under your thumb?  Do you really think I’m going to waste my time doing that?</p>

<p>Also, mods need to be held accountable, and need to enforce the rules without bias.  When you’re being that ambiguous there is too much wiggle room, and it will be abused.</p>

<p>Faking player count is malicious and anti-social.  It deters people from joining other servers, and is lying to everyone.  I don’t see how you can consider it neither.</p>

<p>No it wasn’t… He publicly sold items for over a year whilst being allowed to advertise. It was nothing to do with him selling items as numerous servers over the years also did it including a large percentage of RS2 servers that are advertising in Mopar’s server status page.[/quote]<br>
Why was it banned then?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, because he was lying about it.  He was claiming that he didn’t have enough money to pay for the server so he could sell more items, etc.</p>

<p>Although I agree with this RSCA faked their player count and 3 Moparscape moderators (KO9, xEnt and Peeter) all knew about it. It was even admitted on Mopar. It would be extremely hypocritical to take action now.</p>
<p>It’s also incredibly difficult to prove. For example, idiots like you accuse me of faking my player count but how can you prove it? You can’t… As I said I’d happily show you or anyone else the database on TeamViewer and run live queries to return the online count. I would then teleport to each and every one of the returned players to prove they’re online and chat to them one-by-one.[/quote]It was found out <span class="bbcode-b">after</span> the server died.  What can be done?  Stop the server from being advertised, oh wait, it’s not around anymore…</p>
<p>You’ve outright told me you fake the player count, and that Zilent and yourself essentially have bots logged in so it looks somewhat legitimate.</p>
<p>And I’ll take you up on that offer, and I’m sure others would love to as well.</p>
