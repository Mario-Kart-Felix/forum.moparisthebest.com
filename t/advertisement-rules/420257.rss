<p>No it wasn’t… He publicly sold items for over a year whilst being allowed to advertise. It was nothing to do with him selling items as numerous servers over the years also did it including a large percentage of RS2 servers that are advertising in Mopar’s server status page.[/quote]<br>
Why was it banned then?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, because he was lying about it.  He was claiming that he didn’t have enough money to pay for the server so he could sell more items, etc.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Although I agree with this RSCA faked their player count and 3 Moparscape moderators (KO9, xEnt and Peeter) all knew about it. It was even admitted on Mopar. It would be extremely hypocritical to take action now.</p>
<p>It’s also incredibly difficult to prove. For example, idiots like you accuse me of faking my player count but how can you prove it? You can’t… As I said I’d happily show you or anyone else the database on TeamViewer and run live queries to return the online count. I would then teleport to each and every one of the returned players to prove they’re online and chat to them one-by-one.[/quote]It was found out <span class="bbcode-b">after</span> the server died.  What can be done?  Stop the server from being advertised, oh wait, it’s not around anymore…</p>
<p>You’ve outright told me you fake the player count, and that Zilent and yourself essentially have bots logged in so it looks somewhat legitimate.</p>
<p>And I’ll take you up on that offer, and I’m sure others would love to as well.</p>

If that were true then why haven’t I said a negative single thing about the other mod that said he didn’t?  In fact, I defended/justified his decision.[/quote]No, you didn’t reply. Once my decision was confirmed and the people were proven wrong, of course no one else is going to argue it. If it had been a different mod that said the same thing (without backup, like I started out with), I do not doubt they would have received the same treatment. Especially since I had never talked to the people I was arguing with originally, so their basis could not have been favoritism.[/quote]<br>
Yes I did.  I said something about how the links were changed.</p>
<p>The only mods I will argue favoritism with are Newty, you, and Peeter, unless it’s blatant favoritism.</p>

People wouldn’t want being caught faking player count or selling items, so are those considered malicious?<br>
The former could be considered anti-social because it’s deliberately misleading people in an effort to get more players.<br>
[/quote]It’s funny because most RS2 servers actually make their money for sponsored slots and such by selling items. But that’s beside the point, pardon me. I think the context of those two examples is what would make the difference. For example if someone lied about selling items that MAY be considered to be a money scam, but I doubt faking player count would be considered malicious. That’s why I said ‘probably’, because there’s obviously a varying amount of ‘shame’ for doing those things.[/quote]<br>
What RS2 servers do is irrelevant.  It’s a completely different community, and they have a completely different mentality.</p>
<p>Lying about selling items <span class="bbcode-b">is</span> wrong and bannable.  PP2P was banned from here because of it.</p>
<p>Faking player count is malicious and anti-social.  It deters people from joining other servers, and is lying to everyone.  I don’t see how you can consider it neither.</p>

It has the word malicious tacked on, which is extremely ambiguous and highly subjective.  Your examples pretty much restated the original, without giving any/much insight to what you consider malicious.[/quote]Mmm. Many examples have been given in the past as to what Moparisthebest wont tolerate here, not sure if you’ve seen those before. So I only gave the examples I was 100% sure of, which are spreading viruses and the different types of network attacks.[/quote]I can’t say that I have…  Care to link them?</p>

They’re breaking the rules, and it needs to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Don’t you even dare say that I act differently when it’s Kryptix compared to anyone else.  Just ask Pets, I spoke out against him just as much as I did anyone else, and he muted me because of it.  Look back at PP2P, or one of the other numerous servers that were breaking the rules.</p>

Being ambiguous hurts and helps my argument, because when you’re trying to get out of having to ban someone, for whatever reason, I can shove them in your face.  I don’t like shoving the rules in the mods face, but if they’re being twats about it then my hands are tied…<br>
[/quote]That’s exactly my point. No mod here wants to be responsible for exactly what a rule means, because it changes depending on the circumstances each time. That’s why we leave it up to interpretation based on the current situation. Ask any staff member, that’s how it’s always been.[/quote]There needs to be a balance between the two, and when you just say something malicious, that’s far too ambiguous.</p>
<p>Also, mods need to be held accountable, and need to enforce the rules without bias.  When you’re being that ambiguous there is too much wiggle room, and it will be abused.</p>
<p>And you’re still looking at it from the wrong perspective…  You keep thinking that I’m requesting a comprehensive list when I’m not.  I want <span class="bbcode-b">some</span> generic cases.</p>

You guys just always make mountains out of molehills whenever Kryptix is involved, I just tend to be the only one that doesn’t stand for it an will explain the rules for you. I didn’t even talk to Kryptix before replying to his thread saying that his links weren’t misleading, I deal with this sort of shit all the time.</p>

</aside>
<p>It has to be done on a case-per-case basis. I have attacked my own server on numerous occasions to test it’s protection and how packet flooding is handled but if DDoS as a whole is a bannable offence then someone could find that I attack my own server and I could be banned. If you think something is against the rules then PM Davidi2 and he will decide… If it’s something petty and stupid like an apparent misleading link then I guess you will be laughed at.[/quote]<br>
No, testing your own server/network is <span class="bbcode-b">never</span> malicious; there is also precedent for this.</p>
<p>Why would I PM someone who is under your thumb?  Do you really think I’m going to waste my time doing that?</p>
<p>Misleading links generally aren’t even an issue, but you’re being annoying with them, and plastering them all over the forums.</p>

<p>That’s not even remotely true.</p>
<p>You’re making the rules ambiguous because you don’t want to nail them down so we can’t make a solid argument that someone is actually being malicious.<br>
[/quote]How is that not at all remotely true, when you just said the same thing? You’re right, I’m making the rule ambiguous, because based on the past here I’ve learned that people are always going to shove the rules in your face and say “WELL YOU SAID ONLY THESE THINGS APPLY TO THIS RULE”, which is what I am trying to avoid. I gave you examples, and those apply, but it’s not limited to the examples I gave (which would help you actually if you were trying to say something was malicious and counted)</p>
<p>If you want some more examples: Spreading viruses via a client, DDoSing other servers/paying people to DDoS other servers, using data given on the server to access users personal information (in the cases they use similar passwords or stuff like that on other servers/sites as well)</p>
<p>I repeat, it’s not limited to these at all.[/quote]I never asked for an exhaustive list you dolt.  I wanted some specific examples that are derived from the original rule.</p>
<p>Being ambiguous hurts and helps my argument, because when you’re trying to get out of having to ban someone, for whatever reason, I can shove them in your face.  I don’t like shoving the rules in the mods face, but if they’re being twats about it then my hands are tied…</p>
