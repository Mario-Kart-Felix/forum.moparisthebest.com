    <title>This is confusing, why I keep getting this error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/this-is-confusing-why-i-keep-getting-this-error/66751</link>
    <description>I made a first.java file and put this in it
[code]	class First {
        	public static void main(String[] args) {
                	System.out.println(&quot;George Bush is a fucking retard&quot;);
        	}
	}[/code]
So that it would pop up the text Hello world!, then I tried to do the javac first from command prompt, but I keep getting this.
[code]
C:\&gt;javac first
error: Class names, &#39;first&#39;, are only accepted if annotation processing is expli
citly requested
1 error

C:\&gt;[/code]
Why I keep getting that?</description>
