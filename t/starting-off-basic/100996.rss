    <title>Starting Off Basic</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/starting-off-basic/100996</link>
    <description>Ok, well, i&#39;ve been scripting Scar and SRL for a while now, and its getting too easy and boring, so i want to see if i would be able to learn and script Java.

I&#39;m starting from scratch.  What would an easy, useful, basic, and fun game i would be able to make for java as a first script.  Also, i&#39;ve looked through video tutorials and some other websites, and they teach a lot, but never &quot;specifically&quot; what i seem to be looking for.  So what would be a good starting script would be to make(and where can i get the java compiler thing that i code in lol).  Thanks.</description>

I’d suggest learning the basics of java first and working with your os’ console. Then once you’ve advanced and understood everything, to GUIs, then to applets and finally SIMPLE games. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

Ok, im learning as I go, but i dotn see why learn stuff i will probably never need to so i learn as i use stuff.  I am making an applet game, but i should learn more first.  Im usign eclipse and i got everything working, but java is realyl confusing compared to SRL which im used to using lol.</p>
<p>btw, what do you mean “os’ console” and is a GUI, a form?[/quote]<br>
Your operating system’s console.<br>
And yes, GUI is a “form”</p>
