    <description>Well me and dan have been coding things for my serv, MooseVille, one of those is special. We managed to get double hitter dds, gmaul fast, and d mace working, (dan) and i got the refills + provided FULLY working spec bar. What i need is a bit of help with making custom specials, for example, Dark bow special? Making both hits ALWAYS hit with 50+ more power? To see what we have so far check this out.
