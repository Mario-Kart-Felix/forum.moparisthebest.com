    <title>[Java] New Game (ICT Company) Dev Underway! [TEXT BASED]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-new-game-ict-company-dev-underway-text-based/426439</link>
    <description>[size=18pt]Guys, Finally a game from quirq! :D[/size]
[size=14pt]So this game is about a new company in town; Yours :D
and you can manafacture hardware and software, which all costs to make better things, you can choose how much ram you want in a new Desktop or Laptop 2GB to 32GB and either 32 or 64 bit operating systems :)

Its just a text based game, because I&#39;m not too smart :(

Also you will be able to make consoles later in the game :) Maybe...

But, don&#39;t expect anything for 4-5 weeks because good things take time :)

Thanks in advance for your support :)[/size]</description>
