    <title>Help with making Doors Open. Will Rep++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-making-doors-open-will-rep/417788</link>
    <description>Okay so I&#39;m improving a city, and I need to open some doors. I&#39;m no noob or beginner but I do have problems with doors never really got them. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s in actionhandler.java, I was able to make it so when you clicked the door it just teleported you inside but the problem with that is that you can teleport outside without using another object. Here is the code I used...

[code]		case 1533: 
			c.getPA().movePlayer(2603, 3081, 0);
			break;[/code]

And [b]Yes[/b] I did use the search bar...
If you can help that would be great! :D</description>
