    <title>What Do I Do To Get The Server Up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-i-do-to-get-the-server-up/268250</link>
    <description>i am having some problems with getting a server up.

i have followed a tutorial and have done everything up to and including port forwarding, after that i have selected &quot;runserver.bat&quot; but i dont know what i have to do after this.

i have:
downloaded and installed java
downloaded winrar and extracted the files from a source
port forwarded 
set enviroment variables
downloaded and added my host on no-ip

i dont know what i have done wrong or is there something i should do after what ive allready done and the tutorial i read was just getting started?
plz help  :)</description>
