    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/contentzpk-looking-for-loyal-staff/548774</link>
    <description>We have several videos on youtube, a custom homepage yet to purchase a domain, but are looking for a dedicated coder and advertisers for our server.  Let me explain what I attend to accomplish with my server.  First off, I currently have custom ore&#39;s in game worth more than their previous names and classes.  I want staff who would give greatly needed input and contribute by dedicating some time to not only the players, but to the expansion of the server as a whole.  Please reply if you have experience with coding and/or are good at drawing people in to try something new.  I can promise those who apply two things, we will grow and we will be constantly updating content.  We will have weekly events, always promoting on youtube as well as many other player voted for updates or add on&#39;s.

If you do reply please list the following:

Your name:
Your age:
Your experience with rsps in the past or present:
What skills can you offer to our team:
How will you dedicate yourself to our team:

Thank you for reading my post if your interested in looking at the server, please visit our new website www.contentzpk.comli.com 

Edit: Currently looking for reliable staff and always looking for ideas or suggestions.
We recently upgraded the max level on our server.  In an attempt, to add extended content on the skills and new weapon classes to make our game a more enjoyable one.</description>

<p>You may as well advertise your official 000webhost website. If it looks better and has better content then you should be using that. Attractive websites will draw in more users. You can use it to build a small bit of hype before any serious server content is revealed.</p>
<p>No offence, but I wouldn’t consider joining a server/website if they used a forum generator website. It’s not a good look. Good luck with the project.</p>
