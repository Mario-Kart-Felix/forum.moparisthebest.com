<p><span class="bbcode-b">It’s okay, I don’t need rep. I for some reason, enjoy helping people when I have the time. I’d help more often, but I’m in the process of coding my own server atm, and I’m having a few problems of my own. But I’m sure I’ll fix them xD</span></p>

<p>Thanks for using the search bar, but if you can’t comprehend what your reading just post and I’ll help further, but don’t expect to be spoon-fed.[/quote]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">This kid came here for help, not a search button… You could at least give him a link to it, not a link to like, 50 other links.<br>
Well, I’m going to spoon feed him now. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></span></p>
<h2>[b]Downloading winRar</h2>
<p>To start off, we’ll download Winrar. Winrar is a program in which you can use to extract files from .rar format,<br>
you may download it at:</p>
<p><a href="http://rarlab.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rarlab.com/</a></p>
<h2>Downloading and Installing Java</h2>
<p>After you have done so, we will need the latest version of the Java Development Kit found at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a></p>
<p>Once you have selected the latest version of Java Development Kit, there will be a question asking<br>
which platform you have, or operating system. After you have chosen your platform, you then need to<br>
agree to the terms and services and as the next page loads, click “Download Selected with Sun Download Manager”.<br>
From then on out, let it install and you’ll be okay.</p>
<h2>Getting No-Ip</h2>
<p>Well, if you’re going to have your server remain public, you’re going to have to get No-Ip.<br>
No-Ip is a free service where you can use for websites, or servers. First, you’re going to go to:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.no-ip.com/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.no-ip.com/</a></p>
<p>and register an account at the site. You will then click ‘Your No-IP’ at the top right corner of the page.<br>
Then you need to click the ‘Hosts and Redirects’ button. After you have done so, it will bring you to a page<br>
showing your listed domains that you have added, though if you haven’t added any you’re going to click<br>
‘Add a host’. After you have added your desired domain, you’re going to need to download the No-Ip Duc,<br>
located if you click the button ‘Download’ on the main page. Like you have done before when downloading<br>
Java, you’re going to need to select your operating system and let it download. Now once you have downloaded<br>
No-Ip Duc, run it. Then all you need to check the box next to the domain you want people to log into, and<br>
you’re good!</p>
<h2>Setting up your Environmental Variables</h2>
<p>Environmental variables are what allows you to run your server with Java, without it you would simple get<br>
‘The path is not yet specified’ so this is an extremely important step. We will firstly open ‘My Computer’<br>
and click ‘View System Information’. As you do this, a small applet displaying several tabs, and you will<br>
select the one that says ‘Advanced’ and at the bottom, click ‘Environmental Variables’. Now what you’re going<br>
to do, is go to your ‘Path’ and ‘Classpath’ variables and edit them.<br>
In your Classpath variable, you’re going to take everything currently inside it and edit it with your<br>
latest version of JDK, so right now it would be;</p>
<p>CLASSPATH=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_3\bin;%CLASSPATH%;</p>
<p>NOTE: The jdk1.7.0_3 may change over time. If it does, than just put in your jdk version.</p>
<p>After you have done the Classpath variable, you’re going to find the Path variable and add the code below<br>
inside it.</p>
<p>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_03\bin;</p>
<p>NOTE: Again, the jdk1.7.0_3 may change over time. If it does, than just put in your jdk version.</p>
<h2>Downloading a source/base</h2>
<p>We’re going to need to have something to start from, so choose one from the Base folder.<br>
The base you’ve downloaded could be anything you want, it’s your choice. Now when you had downloaded the<br>
Winrar program earlier, this is where you’ll be using it. Once you have found the base of your choice,<br>
you will need to go into the base file, and once you’ve done so you need to right click it and click ‘extract’.<br>
Once it’s done extracting, you then are free to roam about your source.</p>
<h2>PortForwarding</h2>
<p>From what I’ve seen from many of you members is that PortForwarding is the hardest step to comprehend,<br>
so I’m going to try :P. As I have an old router I may still attempt showing you how, though if anyone feels<br>
they may give me pictures of their router that would be great.<br>
First of all, portforwarding is merely a step to allow people connecting to your computer, but in<br>
this case it’s for connecting to your server. We will first start off by opening your command prompt or<br>
‘cmd’ through your startup window and typing ‘ipconfig’ which will bring up a list of details relating to<br>
your computer, but all we really need is your default gateway. You can find your default gateway if you<br>
scroll down, so once you have done that, open up your internet browser and type it in. This will then bring<br>
up your router page, and you will need to click something like ‘Applications and gaming’, though mine just<br>
says ‘Firewall’. After you have clicked this, you need to add a new user defined application. Any name is<br>
compatible, as long as you follow the syntax shown below and set the application to ‘hosted’.[/b]</p>
