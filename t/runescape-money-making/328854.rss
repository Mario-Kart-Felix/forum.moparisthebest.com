    <title>Runescape Money Making!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-money-making/328854</link>
    <description>The easiest way to make money is to runecraft. It will be easy for members as they have a privilege to runecrafting other runes. So the way to make money is get 54 Rc. So what to do? 
Well what you have to do is finish rune mysteries and get 20 mining and you get to mine pure essence.
So just mine alot like 15k or you can buy it and you will make 10x more. 15k should get you to 54 Rc then at 54 Rc buy as much as pure essence you can buy and take trips to entrana and craft your runes and there you made alot of profit. Bang.
Thanks. No rude comments please.</description>
