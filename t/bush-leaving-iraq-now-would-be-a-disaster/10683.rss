    <description>You are finally correct Mr President, but are you not the same one that created the problem in the first place? That is not the only problem you have created.

Please Mr President, improve the perception I have as you being a worthless President by going to the closest zoo, finding a monkey, teach him how to flip a coin, and have the monkey decide heads for yes, tails for no for all your decisions you have to make. 

Or is that how you decide now?</description>

<p>If you say we control Iraq, man Bush has pulled the wool over your eyes, right now, noone controls Iraq. You can say I am wrong now, but just wait… 1 of two things is going to wind up happening in Iraq. 1. 3 Countries are formed from it, at least 2 of 3 of which will be hostile to the west, if not all 3 of them (once we finally leave… years and years from now). 2. It stays in one piece, and we have another Iran on our hands.</p>

              <p>[quote=“ruler, post:21, topic:10683”]ya the shiites  {iran and hezbollah} are closer to us then the rest.  WRONG!<br>
Again you post things saying do your own research with no substance behind it.<br>
No saddam didn’t know the war was coming we had people telling his people his ppl was a bluff.<br>
your saying saddam would allow our troops in his country but not a small team of un inspectors…<br>
You dont understand “un oil for food”, or the contracts between iraq and russia,germany,france.  It was economics.</p>
<p>About the cia running the media…  I believe the fbi is for domestic issues not the cia.<br>
Iraq is needed for a invasion into Iran.[/quote]</p>
<p>Ruler you cant possbily be that stupid. Either you got the Sunni and the Shiites mixed up, or you flat out dont know what your talking about.</p>
<p>He didnt know the war was coming? What was 300,000 of our troops sitting on his border for while we are dealing with the UN Security Council workign on getting a resolution to go in? Was they on vacation in the desert? LMAO He didnt know we was coming…</p>
<p>I DO understand the food or oil program. You dont know crap about the rest, if you even do that part.</p>
<p>As far as posting without substacne, I tell you to go get the info, on your own.  So you know what the info is, without being able to say I somehow changed it.</p>
<p>Did you go to the state departments site and search for the ambasdor exchange text before the first war? No and I even told you where it was, and what it was. I didnt tell you the fact the US ambassador ensured the Iraq ambasador we woudl do NOTHING if Iraq invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>Of course, you will deny that too, instead of going to go look and see it confirmed on your own Governments website.</p>
<p>Sorry Ruler, you dont know what your talkign about, and your spewing a bunch of crap and look like an idiot to someone that was probably into politics (and Isreal and the middle east is a huge part of it)  before or around the time your parents was even meeting and concieving you.</p>
<p>If you dont want the truth, dont look for it, if you want to beleive alot of bullshit, just listen to the government like the good boy you already are. Just like we are looking for Bin Laden, load of crap, find out what was done to capture him while he was still in Afganistan and you will see, it wasnt much. Why? Look at the patriot act, and look at the second patroiot act that is coming. READ them, and you will see, OBL needs to be free, to reduce our freedoms through the various acts. READ what the laws are, and what they are trying to do to restrict us even more before you deny that fact. Deny it, and I know you havent read it. Read the actual laws inacted, and proposed off the governments sites themselves. DONT take my word for it, the government has it posted themselves. They know lazy people that dont research anything, wont read it, so they have no need to hide it.</p>
<p>Its a shame man, you will sit here and say I am wrong, because you listen to what they tell you they do on TV, instead of reading what they say they do and do on thier own freaking sites.</p>
<p>You even would rather say the CIA is only for outside the country, rather than go look at thier declassified documents about thier plans for the news media. Your trying to say its not true, when the CIA THEMSELVES provided the documents and evidence saying they was thier plans… Get a grip, and do some research on a few of our own governments sites, then come back.</p>

Again you post things saying do your own research with no substance behind it.<br>
No saddam didn’t know the war was coming we had people telling his people his ppl was a bluff.<br>
your saying saddam would allow our troops in his country but not a small team of un inspectors…<br>
You dont understand “un oil for food”, or the contracts between iraq and russia,germany,france.  It was economics.</p>
<p>About the cia running the media…  I believe the fbi is for domestic issues not the cia.<br>
Iraq is needed for a invasion into Iran.</p>

              <p>Its a fact, Saddam offered to let our troops come in, and search for WMD’s. Dont take my word on it, do some research, you will learn the truth. What does anything to do with the UN Inspectors have to do with the offer to let our troops search for them? Saddam knew the war was coming, he knew he would lose power. He tried to save himself, by ALLOWING the forces about to invade, come in and look for themselves, then leave. Do some reasearch…</p>
<p>Like how I would send troops to a to a zone we dont control? What the hell do you call Iraq? HELLO!!! It should be pretty clear my thinking is we dont have a choice at this point, the freaking war is already started, we should never had gone in forcefully if the case was truely about WMD’s. If you say we control Iraq, man Bush has pulled the wool over your eyes, right now, noone controls Iraq. You can say I am wrong now, but just wait… 1 of two things is going to wind up happening in Iraq. 1. 3 Countries are formed from it, at least 2 of 3 of which will be hostile to the west, if not all 3 of them (once we finally leave… years and years from now). 2. It stays in one piece, and we have another Iran on our hands.</p>
<p>Go look at the top people’s name that controls our media, then look at thier history with the CIA. Then go look at some of the CIA’s plans regarding our news media… Again, do some research.</p>
<p>Economics? Sole reason for the war, was to remove Saddam from power. The country he was the biggest threat to was Turkey, which is a member of NATO which would help protect them, not to mention the country he was the biggest threat too, wouldnt even let us invade from it! Gee, guess they thought he would rain missles down on the US instead of them even though he didnt have the capabilty of doing so?</p>
<p>Your last comment really shows you dont know what your talking about, the Shiites is the closest “ally” if you will, we have from the Iraqi people themselves. Even then, they dont particularly like us, since we encouraged them to stand up to Saddam, gave them reason to believe we would protect them, then let Saddam bomb the hell out of them (even though the planes he used to bomb them had to enter the no fly zone, which was supposdly enforced to prevent him from doing that…the tanks, APC’s and soldiers we watched go in on the ground from the no fly zone…). Same thing we did with Kurds in the north before the first gulf war, and after the first gulf war.</p>
<p>Jeez, I wonder why the Iraqi’s have hard feelings against the US, I wonder why the Iraqi people wouldnt help us fight against Saddam when we invaded. Maybe they had learned thier lessons well? Dont trust the US, and dont trust Saddam being removed from power? Yeah, I am sure they learned that real well, sadly it was hardest way possible too.</p>
<p>While your doing some research, research some about the first Gulf war too, one particular very very odd thing you will find about it is in the exchange between the US and Iraq ambassadors BEFORE Iraq invaded Kuwait. Its dead obvious what I mean, if you bother to go find the text (which I believe is on the state deparments site as well).</p>

<p>I like your thinking send in troops to a zone that we dont control, the terrorist would love it. Every action would need a call to washington.</p>
<p>The cia is a joke the best and brightest dont work at the cia.  You give too much credit to the brain power of the gov.</p>
<p>You dont see that its all economics, so you understand the business deals between arab states, russia, germany and france before the war?  All wars are due to economics.</p>
<p>We liked saddam because he countered the shite muslims, the ones that are most againsts the us.</p>

              <p>Ruler there is a big difference in the wars your comparing.</p>
<p>WWII Japan and Germany was the aggressors, pretty much against everyone. Going into Afganistan was fine with the Arabs, we had justification, and they knew it. (At least by the time we actually went, alhtough when an oil company informed Bush they would not build a pipeline from the Caspian sea region through Afganistan due to the Taliban months before 9/11, Bush said and I quote “This means war.”, and the British and Aussies was told in July BEFORE 9/11 we was going into Afghanistan…)</p>
<p>Iraq is a totally different story. Like did ya know… Before the invasion, Saddam offered the US, through France? or Germany? that he would allow ALL of our troops come into Iraq to search for weapons of mass destruction, and would make his army stand down, not a shot fired (Gee, wonder why they was against the war… They knew), only one thing. IF there was no WMD’s found, we had to leave, and leave him in power. So really was WMD’s the concern? Hmmm, we could had done whatever we wanted ourselves as far as searching, with no war if that was the case.</p>
<p>Where was those stories at? Dallas mornign news, CNN (on web site), and New york post all had one paragraph about the offer, buried in the paper, and on the site (in CNN’s case). Hmm, American press dont do what the Government wants? If you dont think in most cases they do whatever that want, your sadly mistaken. Why else does the CIA try to place operatives in high level, decision making positions in the major news outlets???</p>

<p>I voted for bush the 2nd time.  Kerry would not have let Isreal go into lebannon.  Kerry would have pulled all the troops out of iraq.  Kerry would have repealed the tax cuts.  Kerry would have increased social welfare programs which greatly encourage illegals and promised a defense at home.  I dont see any defense without racial profiling or gross clamp down on rights.  We have to fight offensivly, they use our fear of killing civialians against us, our media against us ect.</p>
