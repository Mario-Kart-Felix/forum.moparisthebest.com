    <title>Can&#39;t connect to my no-ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-my-no-ip/220264</link>
    <description>Well, My server has been up and running 24/7 for the last week...and last night a crasher came on with a null bot system...and started crashing. So, i left it running with the auto-restarter on thinking he would go away sooner or later. Well, that was my mistake. I guess somehow he fucked my server stuff up. I just went and re-port-forwarded....And still, I can&#39;t connect. I can only connect with using 0.0.0.0, or 127.0.0.1 but those are my local connections only I can connect with. If someone could please help me, i would really appreciate it. Also, if your help is a success i&#39;ll make you a co on my server :) thanks, k0scape</description>

              <p>did you change your ip adress in the router to what it currently is? is sometimes changes the last 2-4 diggits. and make sure no-ip is still running on your computer and your ip thing on it is enabled</p>
