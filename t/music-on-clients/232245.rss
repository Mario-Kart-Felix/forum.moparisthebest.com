Post this in the moparscape client section. i’m sure you will receive better help there.<br>

Thats for MoparScape client questions only. He is talking about his client. Don’t direct people to post in the wrong section.</p>
<p>I use the real music packet for RS music, and I made a custom packet to play music I have my client download in the background into the cache folder. It can player MIDIs and MP3s. It downloads in the background as I said so the user doesn’t have to wait at startup, and it gets the music out of a music list it redownloads on every startup.</p>
<p>So I am able to add or remove music without the user having to even redownload the client, the client automatically downloads the cache and the music, and I can make the server send packets to play any music I want. :)[/quote]<br>

Only one major flaw I saw in that - don’t redownload the list every time at start-up. Use an update server, and check if a change has been made. Other than that, holy fuck &lt;333333</p>
