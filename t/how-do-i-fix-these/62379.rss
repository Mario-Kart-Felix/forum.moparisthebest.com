    <title>How do i fix these?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-fix-these/62379</link>
    <description>[size=20pt]I HAVE PIMPSCAPE SERVER SOURCE[/size]

Whenever I attack someone, its not how it should look.  I mean it shows me hit them with the weapon about 5 times really fast and on the 6th time i hit them and they lose hp.  How do i fix it so it shows me hit them once and they lose hp.  Also I would like help on fixing armored gloves on pimpscape.  Also when i wear some items you can see the color of my body feature like u can see most of the infinity top but some u can see thru it to my shirt which is black, how can i make it so u can see the whole item?  Please post code here, thanks.
any help?</description>

              <p>For the shirt parts, simply go into item.java and place the ID code of the buggy shirt or whatever it is in the appropriate section.</p>
<p>If the ID of a buggy shirt is 636 for example</p>
<p>then place it in the INT body[] section, with the rest of the ID codes, seperated by a comma. If that doesn’t work then you would try another section that also uses the Top Body equip location. Such as the Int Platebody[] section. Eitherway one should work.</p>
<p>The other one is a thing relating to timers and abs locations. I’m not sure how to fix it right now as I’m tired and about to go to sleep.</p>

              <p>For the first part mess around with the action timer a little bit. For the second part you need to put the infinity top ID under body in item.java</p>
