    <description>The owners Snoopy89 and Crooks like to shit talk - so all go create your new servers with your new clan tags. This doesn&#39;t include client sided shit, but go and download their client, i&#39;m sure you can pull it out of there.

Exactly why pking on his server is dying. He focus’ on quests and how to make a tree damage you and other dumb shit like that… Instead of pking.<br>
[/quote]<br>
It would take us a day to make a PK server with more features than any current PK servers but we simply don’t want to do it… RSC<span class="bbcode-b">Emulation</span> will always be pretty close to how RuneScape Classic was with a few tweaks to improve it. If you actually played back when it was decent you would know that it was actually really fun. It’s a shame private servers with 80x XP (etc) has made everyone so fucking lazy.</p>
<p>Getting a decent kill in the early stages of RuneScape Classic was a considered an achievement, it made you feel like you had earnt something but unfortunately all these ‘PK servers’ just ruined that feeling… You kill random NPC’s for the best armour, get given food and runes and just PK. You PK items that you can get quicker by just killing more NPC’s… It’s just boring and pointless but unfortunately a large percentage of the current community are thick as shit.</p>
<p>I had thought about an optional clan system but it would just encourage people to team meaning you would have 10 vs. 1 all the time, that one person quitting as it’s impossible to stand a chance again 10 people all maging you… That’s basically why BeyondRSC died, one big team just killed everyone else, so people got bored and stopped playing. You know if you go into a really good CounterStike/Call of Duty server and get killed like 30 times without killing anyone, you just wanna turn it off as it’s boring dying over and over again. That’s exactly what clan systems bring IMO.[/quote]</p>
<p>Beyond died because 1 clan took over the server at the EARLY stage. Is your server at a EARLY stage Kryptix? No. Their is about 4 HIGH LVL clans. All with over 10 people each, on your server. And runescape NOW-A-DAYS is all about team pking. Everyone knows this. Anyone with a brain knows this.</p>
<p>And Kryptix. 90% of the people NOW-A-DAYS want to play this server for only Pking &amp; Staking. But it seems like the only thing you care about is doing what YOU want to do. Oh btw, instead of trash talking every server and posting on other peoples post saying how people are advertising and writing essays and how much better your server is, go do something that actually helps RSCE. We don’t give a shit about your tree next to barb ville damaging players and your stupid updates that do nothing</p>
<p>Not to mention, it took you about a month to fix ranging through fungus’ in the wild. But yeah you are so amazing and you can cure cancer Kryptix. (sarcasm to the max)</p>

<p>Crooks paid me to do this - even though this isn’t the whole clan as I’ve done more to it now - either way you’re just making yourself look like a cunt by releasing it.

<p>Well, people like Kryptix focus on smaller and dumber things. Exactly why pking on his server is dying. He focus’ on quests and how to make a tree damage you and other dumb shit like that… Instead of pking.</p>

Clan system takes 15 mins max to code, so theres nothign to brag about and nothing new will come from releasing it,<br>
