    <description>[center]This is a direct quote from SRL, from SRL forums i thought i would post here.[/center]

[size=24pt]SRL - Announcement.[/size]


Runescape is in serious trouble. Free-2-Play is threatened in its existence. Botting is once again seriously destroying the game at an alarming rate. While some may think Jagex deserves it, SRL believes this to be a big mistake. Botting on such a massive scale is stupid, provocative and frankly quite dangerous since it quashes the very basis of our own existence. It is on this light SRL is reaching out a helping hand to Jagex by releasing BotCatcher. BotCatcher reports level-3 and level-4 &#39;s.


Why do we do this?


[ul][li]SRL has been and will always be respectful towards Jagex. We try to be a leech-free community and demand input and creativity from our Members. We feel that recent events will ultimately lead to the destruction of f2p runescape. Unless we do something, we will all end up empty handed, for at this rate of botting, runescape will be gone pretty soon.[/li]
[li]Someone out there is selling runescape bot-liscences. His only goal is to make money. He doesn&#39;t care at all for the game nor the underlying social and economical structure nor for the shear pleasure it gives to 100.000 mainly young players worldwide. And though RS has its dark sides, it is still a wonderful elaborate game, free for all. Destroying a free game is unethical and immoral.[/li] 
[li]We want to make crystal clear we have nothing to do with any of these botting activities. While this has once destroyed Kaitnieks, it wont destroy us![/li] 
[li]Of course we are all aware that releasing this script is a controversial act, but it is not an act of war nor hostility but one of Reason. Point well made, stop destroying the game. Be creative, there are many way of cloaking your existence.[/li]   [/ul]
