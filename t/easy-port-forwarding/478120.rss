    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easy-port-forwarding/478120</link>
    <description>Alright too start this off,  I would like too say there is like a 100 different post&#39;s of tutorial&#39;s on how too port forward,I found someone today that couldn&#39;t port forward so i made one just for him! Anyways I&#39;ll Explain how to Port Forward  the best i can! MAYBE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND MINE!?


Too start off this tutorial click the Start Menu button on the bottom left corner! It will look like this for the Vista &amp; Windows 7 Users

[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk76/bryansankey/Start-Menu-Button_zps644c0d59.jpg[/img]


Once you&#39;re in the Start Menu, Type in cmd then hit enter!



Once cmd pops up, Type ipconfig then hit enter once again!


[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk76/bryansankey/IPCONFIG_zps317aebf8.jpg[/img]


Alright now that you&#39;re at this Window you should find -[enthernet adaper local area connection! ] Under that you should see your Deafult Gateway &amp; your IPv4 Adress

[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk76/bryansankey/CMDPIC1_zpse0bfe608.jpg[/img]


as you can see in the picture&#39;s below -- [ Default Gateway:  192.168.0.1 ]  &amp; my -- [ IPv4 Adress: 192.168.0.12 ] 

[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk76/bryansankey/CMDPIC_zpsabc7cfdb.jpg[/img]


When you have them writen down on a peice of paper, Open your Internet Brower of your choice. Type in your Default Gateway into the URL Then hit enter! It will come to a page like this, not exactly the same but close enough!

[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk76/bryansankey/yee1_zps46d5a09f.jpg[/img]


Default Username &amp; Password is usually [ Admin ]  &amp; if its not admin then look on your Router/Modem (The internet Box that you get from the company your with (Shaw/Telus) whatever it should say something like this http://192.168.0.1 or whatever your Default Gateway is, Under that it should have your Username &amp; Password to the website your Default Gateway Brought you too! 


[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk76/bryansankey/yee2_zps551e48e8.jpg[/img]


Now that your Sighed in please click Applications &amp; Gaming, When you get too a page like this all you really do is change the External Ports &amp; the Internal Ports too 43594.. Leave Protocol on [ Both ] , &amp; make sure you Check Mark the Box [ Enable ] ... 


Must LOOK like this in the END when your finished PORT FORWARDING!! At the bottom of the screen click Save Setting&#39;s BAM your done! &lt;3

[IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk76/bryansankey/yee3_zps374bd4b3.jpg[/img]

NOTE IF YOU HAVE AN EMPTY BOX ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE WHERE YOU DID THE PORT FORWARDING ON MAKE SURE YOU TYPE RSPS INTO IT!! I DID NOT HAVE ONE IN MINE BECAUSE IM SPECIAL &lt;3 ALSO, That not everyone that has to Portward has to do a START &amp; a END in External &amp; Internal I do, most people only have 1 External &amp; 1 Internal where you put in 43594 Where i had to 43594 in two different spots in each External &amp; Internal</description>

You do know you should cover your default gateway and ipv4?[/quote]</p>
<p>No you shouldn’t. You can’t get “hacked” through an IP (nor an IPv4/default gateway). You can only get attacked until you go offline, and that only works with IP addresses and not IPv4 addresses nor default gateways. IPv4’s are local; they’re on your network only. Your default gateway is your router’s IP, which could be the same as anyone else’s. Mine was 192.168.0.1 and so is Owner_Bryan’s.</p>

<p>The Moderators do. They’re the ones who gave you that cute little “Warning” sign next to your Username for that little outburst earlier. Yet, here you are again, posting another New Topic that should not be here.</p>
<p>On Topic: No offense to you; don’t get mad, but this isn’t needed. There are way too many Tutorials on how to do this as it is, and this isn’t any better than the ones which already exist, therefore, it won’t be replacing any of them. This isn’t much of a Tutorial either, because it doesn’t really explain anything. I’ll give you some points for the effort though I guess.</p>

<p>NOTE IF YOU HAVE AN EMPTY BOX ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE WHERE YOU DID THE PORT FORWARDING ON MAKE SURE YOU TYPE RSPS INTO IT!! I DID NOT HAVE ONE IN MINE BECAUSE IM SPECIAL &lt;3 ALSO, That not everyone that has to Portward has to do a START &amp; a END in External &amp; Internal I do, most people only have 1 External &amp; 1 Internal where you put in 43594 Where i had to 43594 in two different spots in each External &amp; Internal</p>
