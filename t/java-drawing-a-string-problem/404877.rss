    <title>[Java] Drawing a string problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-drawing-a-string-problem/404877</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to make a game where as you avoid the square your score goes up. Simple enough right? Anyway when I check for a collision I want text to be drawn the the screen that says the the player lost. This is my code:

[code=java]if (CheckCollision.collision == true) {

                g.setColor(Color.red);
                g.drawString(&quot;YOU LOST!&quot;, 200, 200);

                p.dx = 0;
                p.dy = 0;

                generateHighScoreList(score);

                try {Thread.sleep(5000);}catch (Exception e) {}

                System.exit(0);

            } else {

                score++;

            }[/code]

Everything executes except the string being drawn. This is in the paint method that gets called every frame if that has anything to do with it. Any ideas?</description>

<p>From my understanding of the paint method in java, it doesn’t draw until after you exit  the paint method… if you call Thread.sleep while inside the paint method, the application should just look like its hanging, and then exit 5 seconds later because of the System.exit call[/quote]</p>
<p>Yupp that was the problem. I just moved those statements to another method (gameOver) and added a boolean called gameOver. If the collision boolean is set the true it sets game over to true which runs the method gameOver. The check for the game over boolean is done in the actionPerformed method. Thanks!</p>
