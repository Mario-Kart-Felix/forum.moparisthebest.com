    <title>Got a custom map?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/got-a-custom-map/271351</link>
    <description>Hey guys if anyone made a server and have custom maps like for a training place and commands like ::train. Would you mind to share it with me? i will of course credit you and perhaps if it is a very good map i will donate some $ to you.

Anyway i never learned how to make maps so if anyone is interested on working with me making custom maps or you have a spare custom map please post

Any help is appreciated</description>
