    <description>[size=10pt]I am here to inform you guys and girls out there of this great new server! The server is called InfernalX. It is a 718. This server was put online less than a week ago, and we are in need of some more players as well as staff! We have some very active members, and we would love to have you as one of those active members!

We have some very awesome features to our server. You can donate for items such as Nex sets, and Primal items! You can donate for these or obtain them in-game by facing some incredible challenges against breath taking bosses! This server may just be starting out, but that does not mean that it is a bad server! 

This server includes things such as the money pouch, and bank tabs. We also have mini games including barrows and the fight caves! We have multiple skilling areas that were made available to you for the quickest possible skilling. The server also has automated double xp weekends! Join us today, and have a great time!!
