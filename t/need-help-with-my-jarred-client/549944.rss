    <title>Need help with my jarred client!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-jarred-client/549944</link>
    <description>If someone could help me over skype that would be great. So I added my cache to drop box and go the auto cache download to work. When I use my regular &quot;run&quot; in my client it will download my custom cache and it will work. but when I use my jarred client to try to download the cache it tries to look for a deathlypvpz cache and wont download properly. I tried rejarring it over and over but it keeps doing that even though the regular client is working fine. any suggestions what the problem could be?</description>
