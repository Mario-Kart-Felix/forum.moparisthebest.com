    <description>[size=18pt]Project ServerSoft - Saturday, November 27th, 2010: 12:14 P.M.[/size]
[hr]
[center]Hello, and welcome to the [size=12pt][b]Project ServerSoft[/size] Informative thread.[/center]
[center]ServerSoft has been a fast growing community over the years, and is soon to be released for download! However, the [/center][center]project hasn&#39;t been fully complete, so no download link has been[/center]
[center]made yet. The server has been entirley created by ServerSoft staff and helpers, there is not a single spec of code that[/center][center] was created by us. We have a very Unique server, which is also lag free. We use Event Managers rather[/center][center] then using the Process for timer and constantly active methods. Our server Networking is ran through[/center][center] the Python, Mina-Core, etc and is setup to be very efficient. Our computer-base is totally lag free,[/center][center] with over 600 GB of memory, dedicated to running the server network.[/center][hr]


[ol][/ol]
A list of features that have been added to the server over time:
[list][li]The [b]Grand Exchange[/b]. (With two new methods added, AutoSell() and AutoBuy(). Put an item up for sale or buy on the G.E, and it will automatically buy or sell without having to wait for other players to make the same transaction.[/li]
[li]All [b]24 Skills Trainable[/b]. Each of them has it&#39;s own unique style, with very many ways to train them, especially in different areas![/li]
[li]Unique [b]Ladder Climber and Door Openener[/b]. We now have every door in most regions of the server working, meaning they can now fully close and shut. Also you can climb up ladders, and enter dungeons.[/li]
[li]The [b]Construction[/b] Skill! The Construction skill is very much like the original RuneScape Server. You can build a variety rooms, with their objects. The rooms are savable, with 67% of the objects that go with them, including Dungeons.

[ul][li]Very Efficient [b]Agility[/b] Skill. The skill is very unique with perfect animations. It took us 4 months to fully complete this skill but it&#39;s finally done. Agility Shortcuts have also been added.[/li]
[li][b]World Changing[/b], which is one of our server&#39;s most [b]appreciated[/b] updates. The worlds are set server-side, and they&#39;re written to the client. The server will tell the client which IP to connect to with what Port.[/li]
[li]Over 15,500 items on the client!


The server&#39;s stability was checked and was recognized as a very stable server by many beta testers, players and including ServerSoft staff - All using different computers testing while about 100 more on server, simeotameously. Please accept our sincere appologies, but we&#39;re currently behind our deadline to get some updates done, so we really haven&#39;t scheduled when we&#39;ll take pictures. Please give us at least 24 hours, (1 day), and we will have complete pictures of our contents.

Please vote in the Poll, and Give us your Ideas and Suggestions below. This will be needed, and the more positive votes and feedback I will release this server for download, to everyone![/li][/ul]</description>

<p>Well actually during the time of RuneScape 562, we gathered the cache, and gathered our own Mapdata from it. We have 3,768 Pieces of Valid Map Data. Our server use to previously be 525, so what we did was convert our 525 source to 562 and actually worked.<br>

<p>Sounds like this won’ t be some cookie-cutter bullshit that everyone sees in the Server Development section week after week. Best of luck to you bro.[/quote]</p>
<p>Also we have a client that was specially modified through ServerSoft, and we’ve written two tools for it. One decompiles script data in the cache files to something readable. The other tool writes/overwrites the script data and compiles them back into their original form. Not too much can be used to it, that can actually be a big thing, but there’s still miscellaneous use for it.</p>
