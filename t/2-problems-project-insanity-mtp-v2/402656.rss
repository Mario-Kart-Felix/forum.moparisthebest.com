    <description>This is Project Insanity, MTP V2 Source to be Exact, Now with the Problems ;

1st; I want to be able to make it when a person joins a clan chat, the clan chat is THIERS until the server actually restarts, like after he logs and someone joins the cc, it says that he still owns it.

2nd; I wrote my own quick chat system. Except when I click Attack, it works 100%, then i click strength, nothing, defence, nothing, same for other stats, then I click herblore etc, and it says the hp quick chat.</description>
