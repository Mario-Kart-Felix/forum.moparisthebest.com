    <title>[PI] Adding items to FormationX V3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-items-to-formationx-v3/410192</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I downloaded FormationX a while ago and I&#39;ve done a fair amount of editting on it, but i was having a look through the client and found there was no itemdef.java ? or even item.java for that matter, So i was wondering how the hell would i add custom items? I dont want to go over board on items but i would like to know how so that way i can maybe fix up a few items, etc

If someone knows how to add items please let me know :) Thanks!</description>
