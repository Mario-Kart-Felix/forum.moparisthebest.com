    <title>Denied by Reign</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/denied-by-reign/238453</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Ubuntu community manager Jono Bacon[/b] has released Denied by Reign, his much-anticipated (at least in open source circles—and my basement) metal album, [b]under a creative commons license[/b]. The album is part of his solo project, called Severed Fifth, which he intends to use as a springboard for testing music economics and promoting awareness of open content distribution models.

The metal album, which consists of eight tracks, is available for free in OGG and MP3 formats from the Severed Fifth web site. The tracks can be downloaded individually or together in a compressed archive and are also being distributed via BitTorrent. For his project, Bacon selected the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike (CCSA) license, which will enable users to share and modify the content as long as they properly attribute it and make derivatives available under the same license.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ogod, nerdiness+music = metalcore?
