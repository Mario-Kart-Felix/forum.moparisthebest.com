    <title>The Australian Dirt-Track Championships</title>

    <description>No, I did not race. It was for the Open class. But I did get a very respected job. Since I&#39;m a recognised member of Raymond Terrace Motorcycling Club, I got to be the Starter. And Team Yamaha&#39;s &quot;helper&quot; :o My ears are still wringing, because I would stand in this tower, with my friend, (Jake) Every race, Jake and I would run down, pull the gates up with Gate-Picks, run to the tower. Wait 10 Minutes, then the riders would come to their starting grid, just after the previous race finished. It was the best fun. Jake and I got food passes, and we were aloud to help ourself to Team Yamaha&#39;s food box (Jake rides a 02&#39; Yz85 Small wheel, and I ride a &#39;06 Yz85BW) It was great. I got to meet some Factory Team Yamaha riders. I got everything. I was spoilt like a king. I even got a put around on the new 07&#39; Yz85&#39;s (only like 10 metres, then I hit the other team&#39;s pit-area)

If anyone went to Raymond Terrace Motorcycling Club track. You might have seen me :o I was doing the Gates.</description>
