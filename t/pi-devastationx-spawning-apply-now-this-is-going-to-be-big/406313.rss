DevastationX is a spawning/Pickup Private server. We have great plans in the future, we are going to have a $600 starting capital which we are planning on using to host/advertise. DevastationX is not a Hybrid PVP V3 server, instead it&#39;s a Orical-X based RSPS. Our goal is to have amazing and exciting PKing zones which include both single and multi PVP areas, we are allowing players to experience a great and more up-to-date style of PVP&#39;ing which include the summoning NPC&#39;s, These NPC&#39;s will help you kill players/NPC. The server has a Kills Requirements system which prevents people from having full access to every weapon avaliable. Instead, they would be obligated to reach a certain amount of Kills before being given the ability to wear a certain item. We also offer tags for PKers who care about respect. E.G. If you reach 1,000 kills you are given a yell tag of a &quot;legendary PKer&quot;.

Why should I consider you (Apply effort into this question): Why would i make a good moderator? I would make a good mod because i have had Been mod many times on various servers. silentX was a server with 100+ people, now it is dead so i dont go on that anymore and i have resigned from being mod there. I have also owned and been admin aswell as co-owner on many servers, when i was mod on silentX people liked me, because i was fair to them and i would never abuse any powers. If 2 hours+ a day isnt enough i can put more time into the server. I dont have much else to say other than when i get a staff position i stick to that server untill its dead. and i dont go to others.  Im fair with players and other people, i give them chances that they deserve, if they do it again or if it was bad enough i would do the proper thing to make it right then message you or put it on the forums why and the proof that that person has been banned or what ever reason it is.  I dont have anything else to say other than, I think i would be a good addition to your team and if you dont accept its alright as there are many others.<br>
How active are you: it all depends, my average is 2hrs a day if im not out with family/friends. thats 5 days a week. when i get more time it will go up to 4hours+<br>
Timezone: EST standard</p>

Why should I consider you (Apply effort into this question):<br>
Where should I begin? Unlike most of the community, I’m not an immature, rage filled 12 yr old. When I want something to get done, I make sure it gets done. I’ve been a part of the community since 08, and first started pservers around 07. My grammar is correct, and pretty OCD about stuff. I keep strong order and have little tolerance for bullshit.<br>
How active are you: How active am I as in how often do I get on the computer? Plenty. You can’t judge my activity based on something that doesn’t yet exist or that I haven’t been active to at all.<br>

Why should I consider you (Apply effort into this question):well i was a co owner for server called Deadlyscape back in 08 and i kept the position for about 3 years until the server was shut down. I took a couple of months off from Runescape servers. Anyway all i want to do is become a help for this server, i want become part of what looks like an incredible project and i believe it will become big. I want to be part of this process and i want to help out the community in any way. Because when i help out as much as i can, i know players will continue to play, because of a great staff (which i promise i will be). Im not in it for the power, to be honest a moderators aren’t respected in many servers. That’s because they abuse their power. Im not an idiot and i dont plan on doing that. So i hope you get a chance to see this and understand that i am free and im ready to give this project all i got.</p>
<p>How active are you: Well ive taken a brake from RSPS’s but im incredibly active now and you will see me on all the time, trust me.</p>

<p>More information:<br>
My main strength is marketing, i can get make your costs as low as possible, while making your income as high as possible. I have proof of my previous success, for example my newest server “<a href="http://crusadex.com" rel="nofollow noopener">crusadex.com</a>” got around 600 mill RSGP and £200 in donations in 2 weeks. However the most successful of my servers was “<a href="http://torvascape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">torvascape.com</a>” which was running around 4 months ago, in the 2 months that was running, i managed to get more then $2000 dollars. Paypal became a bitch though when they found out i was 16. I spent the money though…</p>

Why should I consider you (Apply effort into this question): I love playing private servers, I love figuring things out in them such as things different than RuneScape. I also love being an active player for as long as I possibly can, I am also always active not only online in the game but also in the forms. I love helping people out with whatever they are needing. I can assure you that you will be happy to have me as a part of you team.<br>
How active are you: Online everyday, about 3-7 hours per day.<br>
Timezone: Eastern Standard Time (EST) GMT +5.</p>
