    <title>Errors in your Script? Read here first</title>

    <description>Now the quickest way you can get an answer is to provide the most helpful information,
This post will let you know what it is you need to provide:

[b]The name of the script[/b] you got the error from, [i]Who it&#39;s by if possible.[/i]
[b]The actual error you received[/b],[i] Look below for instructions[/i]
[b]Include the script as either an attachment, A link to the topic, or in code tags[/b][code]Example of code tags[/code]



[b][u]How to find what error you received:[/u][/b]
Here is a picture of what your SCAR might look like, also note, I have highlighted in Yellow, the box called, &quot;The Debug Box&quot;

If you look at the last line, it says
Line 7: [Error] (7:20): Invalid number of parameters in script

That entire line, is our Error :)


[b][u]How to layout your post:[/u][/b]
The title is not as important, make sure you just include [ERROR] in it, an example:
[ERROR] Help with script please

Never forget to always start with an introduction, Hey, How are you, etc.
Don&#39;t forget that the people who help you here are human aswell, and would like to be treated justly.
Remember that no one HAS to help you.

Next include the name of the script followed by the author if you know it
Followed by the error you received, an example above.
Finally put in the entire script or just the 10 lines around the error(EG: Above the error was line 7, so I&#39;d put lines 3-10 in my post) into your post as either an attachment, link or in code tags.
NOTE: If you only include a few lines, make sure you let them know which one is the line with the error!

Never be disappointed by the response you get, it could be that it&#39;s simply an error you made which caused the script to stuff up, or the script could be old or outdated.

Title: [ERROR] Help with PowerCutter

Hi, I&#39;m having some problems with a script I just downloaded, I&#39;m not sure how to fix it so any help would be greatly appreciated.

Script: PowerCutter, by Nashi
Error : Line 251: [Error] (12894:7): Unknown identifier &#39;FindMime&#39; in script C:\Program Files\SCAR Divi CDE\Scripts\NashiPowerCutter.scar

Since it&#39;s a big script I&#39;ll only post lines 245-255, if you need the rest I&#39;ll update my post.
[code]  begin
    case I of
      1: if FindDead then
           Result := True;
      2: if FindMod then
           Result := True;
      3: if FindMime then //Line 251
           Result := True;
      4: if FindMaze then
           Result := True;
      5: if FindQuiz then[/code]

Hey there, NewKid101.
Unfortunately with that script, It will no longer work, It hasn&#39;t been updated in nearly a year and Nashi no longer scripts SCAR.
You&#39;d have to find another script =/</description>
