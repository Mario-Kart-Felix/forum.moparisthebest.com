    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagexs-cunning-little-plan-unraveled/151331</link>
    <description>Some of you have noticed the new Shop Improvement(haha, yeah, whatever) on the 2nd of Oct, but I only noticed it today, but I noticed something else, a cunning plan by Jagex.

So, what is wrong with the new improvement? Selling has got faster, buying EXTREMELY faster(50k a time), what&#39;s there not lot to like? Well, apart from the gem shop in ardougne, or the silver guy not selling bulk gems/silver ore/bars, there isn&#39;t much to hate about it. Elemental runes have now gone down in price from 24(player price) to 17, but what about nature runes? They stock at 372 each now, up almost 72gp per rune from player prices. Also, they&#39;ve gone up from their previous max price of 350. This, my friends, is the plan, try and fuck up the market. Yew logs have gone up from 250 to 350, improvement for the yew cutters eh?

So, now, if you buy 1 yew log from players, and 1 nature rune from a shop, that leaves you 46gp. We still have to buy natures from players, yew logs have gone up RIDICULOUSLY, and the demise of runecrafting is upon us. If yews go down to 300gp, you won&#39;t need to buy natures from players. That would be an ideal situation for alchers, flax and yews are always easy to buy(I bought 16k flax and 16k yews within 30 mins), however natures aren&#39;t. Like I said, if yews go down to 300gp, there&#39;s no need to buy from players(unless you want profit), and you only loose 4gp an alch(yes, 400k per 100k alchs, easily enough to get you to 94 mage from 80), as a result, mage levels soar up, runecrafting(or possibly fletching) gets ruined, rangers soar up. GG melee, you&#39;ve been broken.</description>

              <p>i dont see why they drop prices on things i mean i have seen several people that were pures walking around with 2b and a party hat… if your good at staking you will have 2b and phat set in a week. You could be lvl 30 and make 2b of staking as long as you know what you are doing. If you dont then thats your problem. I really dont see why people are poor in this game its so easy to get rich as long as you have luck + skill</p>

<p>Jagex have done two bad things for autoers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Runes wont take ages to buy so no one will buy the runes from the asian people who sit there all day buying runes.</li>
<li>Nats prices have been increased, inevitablly i believe this will drive down the price of yews, and that will slow autoers cutting yews.</li>

              <p>Some of you have noticed the new Shop Improvement(haha, yeah, whatever) on the 2nd of Oct, but I only noticed it today, but I noticed something else, a cunning plan by Jagex.</p>
<p>So, what is wrong with the new improvement? Selling has got faster, buying EXTREMELY faster(50k a time), what’s there not lot to like? Well, apart from the gem shop in ardougne, or the silver guy not selling bulk gems/silver ore/bars, there isn’t much to hate about it. Elemental runes have now gone down in price from 24(player price) to 17, but what about nature runes? They stock at 372 each now, up almost 72gp per rune from player prices. Also, they’ve gone up from their previous max price of 350. This, my friends, is the plan, try and fuck up the market. Yew logs have gone up from 250 to 350, improvement for the yew cutters eh?</p>
<p>So, now, if you buy 1 yew log from players, and 1 nature rune from a shop, that leaves you 46gp. We still have to buy natures from players, yew logs have gone up RIDICULOUSLY, and the demise of runecrafting is upon us. If yews go down to 300gp, you won’t need to buy natures from players. That would be an ideal situation for alchers, flax and yews are always easy to buy(I bought 16k flax and 16k yews within 30 mins), however natures aren’t. Like I said, if yews go down to 300gp, there’s no need to buy from players(unless you want profit), and you only loose 4gp an alch(yes, 400k per 100k alchs, easily enough to get you to 94 mage from 80), as a result, mage levels soar up, runecrafting(or possibly fletching) gets ruined, rangers soar up. GG melee, you’ve been broken.</p>
