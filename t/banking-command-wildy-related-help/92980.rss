    <title>Banking command &amp; wildy related - help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/banking-command-wildy-related-help/92980</link>
    <description>I made my own command. It looks like this -
Can you guys tell me what&#39;s wrong with it...

[code]else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;bank&quot;)) {
if (inwildy == false)
openUpBank();
}
if (inwildy == true) {
sendMessage(&quot;You can&#39;t bank in Wildy n33b!&quot;);
}[/code]

I compiled, no errors, and ran my server. I logged onto my server and I tried open the bank using ::bank in non wildy and it worked. Then I teleported to a wildy zone and tried it. It didn&#39;t work and I got the sendMessage above ^. Then I went back to a non wild zone, and this time I couldn&#39;t open the bank using ::bank. I got the sendMessage ^ aswell, W.T.F.?

Can anyone make me a command that when I bank in wildy I get that message, and when I bank in non wildy, I successfully bank?</description>
