    <title>Packet editing</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/packet-editing/396282</link>
    <description>So im trying to work off a base of packet editing in online games but its not very simple im slowly finding out but, im posting here because i wanted to start touching in on doing it on a rsps if i could find a good base to work off of then i would be willing to put together a global cheat client for each revision.

I&#39;m sure im gonna hear troll after troll about this but i dont really care to be honest. you wanna troll shoot me an email and we&#39;ll see what happens to you comp, dont post it here.

anyways i was just wondering what you guys think. would this be a good base for a cheat client since the communication between client and server is all packets anyway right?

opinions?
possible?
good or bad idea?

and ill keep you updated as far as the whole packet editing in a rsps goes. but im not entirely sure its possible to be honest just cause of the amount of security build into runescapes infastructure but if its a non leeched base then it shouldnt be a problem right? most people wouldnt think to make some kind of protection for this i would think

That or im just blowing smoke outta my ass and wasting my time on something that just isnt possible?</description>

It’s worth a shot, but every server edits the packets to get what they want done nowadays.<br>

<p>I assumed he meant for rsps… Every client out there that has clan chat, lootshare, etc. have changed various packets to make it all work</p>
