    <description>I downloaded MoparScape, and I get IP&#39;s and ports and play like that. IT usually says &quot;error connecting to server&quot;. But what&#39;s the point in downloadling like BlackScape, Only The Best v2.5...and stuff like that?</description>

              <p>the reason your getting error conecting to server could be caused by multiple things, for instance bad internet connection. I think your a little confused, when someone says: “Download my server!”, it means like download their source, which you would do if you were starting a server.</p>
