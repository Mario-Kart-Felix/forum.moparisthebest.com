    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-help-trade-follow-getting-friends-to-show-if-they-are-online/296295</link>
    <description>As you read I have been searching and such and have came up with no answers :(. On my server when I click trade on another player, nothing happens at all. Nothing pops up to the other player. And nothing gets done. I am getting unhandled button errors, but I am new with this and would like some help as to fixing it. Same thing happens with follow, unhandled button and nothing happens. As for the friends list issue, everytime I log out and in the friends list is wiped and when I add someone that is on nothing happens.

Any help is GREATLY appreciated. Please &amp; Thanks,
