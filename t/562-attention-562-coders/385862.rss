    <description>EDIT:NEED SERIOUS HELP ! PLEASE LEAVE A RESPOSNE ATLEAST INSTEAD OF IGNORING ME@@@
THE LITTLEST INFORMATION CAN HELP!!! &gt;:[]

Guys,I kinda started a 562 and I can&#39;t get it online,now I&#39;m connecting locally atm,but I WANT IT TO BE ONLINE!
Iv&#39;e posted several threads of me needing help on bringing my server online.But no one ever helps.Now if there is someone out there nice enough to help me,please respond here.

Now Iv&#39;e already changed the old servers no-ip to my no-ip,and yes I have found all of the old no-ip in the files.

I have portforwarded,
I have a no-ip,
I have a client,
you can see that I&#39;m not a noob that trys to just say,&quot;how do I put my server up???&quot;
I have a serious problem here.
Thanks!
P.S Everytime I try to put my servers public,I always fail,So IF I CAN JUST FIND OUT HOW TO DO THIS,THANK YOU SO MUCH!
