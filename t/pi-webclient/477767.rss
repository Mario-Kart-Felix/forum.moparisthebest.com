    <description>need help my jar file works fine when i log on music plays and global items load.
On the webclient no global items load or music plays why?
ok so i have a webclient that has full music. when it logs on my source it doesnt play music and doesnt load up global items. In the jar file it loads up global items and plays music. The webclient for some reason works on the other server and loads up global items and music but why wont it do it for my actualy source?</description>
