    <title>In Development: Player Owned Houses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-development-player-owned-houses/121885</link>
    <description>I have been working on Player Owned Houses lately. Im gonna need some help im about 90% done.

[b]Done:[/b]

[i]-Construction Skill
-Construction Skill And Exp Saves
-Player Owned Houseing Area (Looks Good)
-Players Cant See What Your Building (So it wont affect gameplay)[/i]

[b]To Do:[/b]

[i]-When You Place A Object It Saves
-Invited Players Can See Your House[/i]

[b]I will be releasing the coding for all this.
So any decent coders want to help me finish it?[/b]

[i]This will work on every source.[/i]
[i]It will be very idenical to Runescape Player Owned Housing.[/i]

[b]How It Will Work:[/b]

[i]A player goes to a portal and he must have 100mil to go in. When he goes in it gives him a command that cant be used by non-buyers. If they dont have enough they can preview Player Owned House Island. Players cant see you on the island when you use the command and portal it makes you invisible to other players untill you leave or do ::normal. Houses can be any size since you wont interfear with anyone else.[/i]

[b]Please comment and help us please (Coders) Ill put you on the credits list when I release the finished product[/b]
[b]Suggestions are very useful so please suggest your ideas[/b]</description>

<p>its used by ::npc to map npcs to  Spawn.txt file… in my server so I spawn alot of npcs restart server and when I join in my server I see all the npcs I spawned… it saves them… in the format above edit it up to save your format for playerHouses</p>
<p>i would use something like this for playerHouses.</p>
<p>object = ID	X	Y<br>
object = ID	X	Y<br>
object = ID	X	Y<br>
object = ID	X	Y<br>
object = ID	X	Y</p>
<p>etc… in moreinfo file… and loading code is easy since its already coded for npcs/object spawns its same format just different words</p>
<p>remove a couple of  .append("	")  's since npc uses soo much extra stuff you don’t really need</p>

              <p>This is fairly easy to do…</p>
<p>For the saving/loading of player owned houses I wouldn’t waste soo much time on it<br>
from ObjectHandler copy the loadObjects inner code and place it into moreinfo loading<br>
and Saving code could be the npcmapping its similar to ObjectLoading code expect change a few names</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    try {
      BufferedWriter bufferedwriter;
      bufferedwriter = null;
      bufferedwriter = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("./moreinfo/playernameHere.txt", true));

    }</code></pre>
<p>thats about it… start coding your  PlaceGlobalObjects for each player you invite to your house to load up Objects already loaded from moreinfo and the saving changes to house code would already be added since moreinfo saves are called everyone player logs out.</p>
<p>since moreinfo files are sorted by username searching from other pplz houses would be easy too just load up house u want to enter by filename</p>
<p>loop all objs loaded from moreinfo and place them as GlobalObjects when a user gets invited.</p>
<p>only problem is if ppl use Construction for building houses right lvl 1 constuction is bank right? so a players house will be filled with banks until he gets enough lvls to built better stuff…</p>
