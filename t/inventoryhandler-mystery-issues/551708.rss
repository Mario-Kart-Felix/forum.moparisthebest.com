    <title>InventoryHandler mystery issues?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/inventoryhandler-mystery-issues/551708</link>
    <description>So I have just been messing around with a 667 source and I&#39;ve noticed that there was a shop with lots of packages. Such as this package, when you click it, gives you a torva set, and so on. So I bought all of them and tried clicking them all just to find out that none of them actually work. So I went into InventoryOptionsHandler to see if there was a code associated with the proper item ID for the packages and there was. So now I see now problem as to why most packages or on-click commands items aren&#39;t working. Same with item 693 which is the &quot;Dice Permit&quot;. I see nothing wrong with the code or where it is placed yet in game, you click it, and nothing happens. I&#39;ll post my InventoryOptionsHandler class.</description>

<p>That’s the only thing it threw that stood out to me.</p>
<p>Edit: And yes, it is the first option, I made sure of that</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>The first question would be… Is the action you’re clicking the first click action on the item? Because if you’re clicking the second or third option, that would be why it isn’t working… Add in a debug statement to the handleItemOption1 method and see if it prints when you click the action on the item</p>
