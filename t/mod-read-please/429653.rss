    <description>Hello first of all.
some one backstabber me on my server.
called conription.
he made the server status page on moparscape and now hes using it for his own server.
i dont have acces to make a another one because that guy is using my ip.
EVEN SOME OF MY PICTURE&#39;S AND MY TEXT..
so he bassicly hacked me and my vote that i got for my server are now resseted.
this is the guys status page that he stole from us.
http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?server=stoner1337.no-ip.org
with some picture&#39;s of my server in it you can se that for sure.
this is my server status page.
which is hacked by that person.
http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?server=concription.no-ip.biz
as you can see he changed the picture&#39;s and posted his thing double.
if you need prove that conription is my server go friendly visit my server and i ask people.
give me a link so i can open it on my vps so i can reset my page.

              <p>lol all he did was register your server ip all you have to do is click the uncheck box with the serverip name on the duc 3.0 or delete that ip on <a href="http://no-ip.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com </a> and make a new one and then you could probably register that one because it will bring downtime % on your old serverip because its not online which could delete it</p>

<p>EDIT: the point is, im hosting 24/7, hes using my server IP to get 100% uptime, he just renamed it to stonerscape, but Uses MY No-ip.<br>
Wich is hosted on my vps, if i am able to get a link that when i open it on the vps, it will reset the vote page, than i would appriciate that.</p>

              <p>The ip is hosted from your computer/host though…? So it isn’t using his server, unless he is using your login with no-ip duc. In which case, just make a new ip.</p>
<p>Other then that, loled at the lack of knowledge on what you were talking about.</p>
