    <description>Hello,

Well there was a dupe within my server, which can only be fixed with a logout timer, adding the timer has somehow stopped the range following from working.

I added this under (UseBow)

inCombat = true;
lastCombat = System.currentTimeMillis();
lastAttack = lastCombat;

And everytime i try and range follow it doesnt work. Range following works perfectly without this added but without this people can dupe. So i figured that this was more important to have within the server.

Thank you for reading.

Please reply, ive posted a few times before but nobody has replied.</description>
