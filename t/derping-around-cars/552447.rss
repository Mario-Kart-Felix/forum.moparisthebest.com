    <description>
started derping around with cars in my 3d engine, planning on working on this while i take physics in the upcoming school year. Also reading articles on vehicle physics. to my hardcore shard master fans : dw i haven&#39;t stopped developing shard master.

These graphics are mint idk what drugs u r on lol</p>
<p>Physics are way better imo, ill try to release next build asap.</p>

              <p>With projects like this that you don’t actually plan to ‘release’ as such, but rather do it for learning, as many people have stated above it’s best to open source it or at least show some of your code so people can help you improve. Remember, there’s a lot of programmers on this forum that are probably far better than you. Who knows, they might drop in and give you some tips on what to improve or what if you’ve got some bad design, allowing them to view the source will allow you to improve your code.</p>

<p>This is still your project it’s not like we are trying to switch your whole project around and make you rewrite everything. Criticism is just to help you get better and to help you learn. Not to just tare you down. Well in this forums you might get put down a little. But for the most part it will be mostly positive help if you even need any. They just want to see if it’s really your work or not. And there really is no harm in it what so ever. Especially for this type of project.</p>

<p>Alright, let’s cover a few things.</p>
<p>[ul][li]We aren’t here to rip out your heart and devour it. The idea is that you post the source code and we point out parts that could have been done better. <span class="bbcode-b">Nobody</span> expects your code to be perfect. In fact, it’s near impossible to write perfect code. The lovely part about this community is that we have people who have a lot of knowledge in their chosen areas and when combined, they can offer very solid advice. It’s a great resource.[/li]<br>
[li]You said that it’s too late to implement any suggestions and anything additional would require a rewrite. This is a silly way of thinking about things. You’re looking at it all wrong. This project isn’t your end-point. Chances are, you will have many future projects that end up being a lot more difficult than your current. The idea is to learn as much as you can from each one, so you’re capable of handling of the next and more challenging project. It’s perfectly fine if you don’t implement our suggested changes in your project. That’s cool, we get it. But next time you open up your IDE and start writing, you think think back to those suggestions and start producing something one step above what you’re currently producing. That’s progress and it’s a beautiful thing.[/li]<br>
[li]When you get into the real world, you’re not able to hide your code so you can prevent your feelings being hurt. In fact, I have to have my code gutted and spat on in code reviews every time I write anything. It sucks when someone tells you your hard work is terrible but you learn to never write terrible code.[/li]<br>
[li] Making something open source doesn’t mean you’re giving your baby away. Imagine how it would feel for someone to start adding to your project. For someone to love your work as much as you love it. Then also imagine who you’re helping but releasing this. Remember when you started out and wanted to view examples? Same thing. [/li]<br>
[li]As you progress, you will start to figure out why conventions are used. I’m a strong believer that people should learn from their mistakes, otherwise they will wonder why they’re doing something. Let us point out where you’re falling short and explain <span class="bbcode-b">why</span>.[/li]<br>
[li]We’re strongly against false credit here. This is another reason why we ask for evidence. Once you’ve done this a few times, we will trust your work and there will be no need. Let us help you and let us give you the credit you deserve (assuming you wrote everything).[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>This is a great read for you:<br>

For someone to love your work as much as you love it. Then also imagine who you’re helping but releasing this. Remember when you started out and wanted to view examples? Same thing. [/li]</p>
<p>[li]As you progress, you will start to figure out why conventions are used. I’m a strong believer that people should learn from their mistakes, otherwise they will wonder why they’re doing something. Let us point out where you’re falling short and explain <span class="bbcode-b">why</span>.[/li]</p>
<p>[li]We’re strongly against false credit here. This is another reason why we ask for evidence. Once you’ve done this a few times, we will trust your work and there will be no need. Let us help you and let us give you the credit you deserve (assuming you wrote everything).[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>This is a great read for you:<br>

<p>This game has progressed so far that most criticisms will end up with me having to rewrite the engine…<br>
I don’t feel I write code the same as most people on this forum, I tend to not use some conventions, like I use underscores in some variable names, I also don’t use getters and setters because they just add more shit to look at in a class file. I like to make static classes rather than singletons. And there are a couple more which I can’t remember. But I basically try to inline my code as much as possible to increase efficiency and decrease memory usage (since it is a graphics/game engine that uses only the CPU).<br>

<p>This is still your project it’s not like we are trying to switch your whole project around and make you rewrite everything. Criticism is just to help you get better and to help you learn. Not to just tare you down. Well in this forums you might get put down a little. But for the most part it will be mostly positive help if you even need any. They just want to see if it’s really your work or not. And there really is no harm in it what so ever. Especially for this type of project.</p>
<p>But I wish you luck with the project anyways. Even if you decide not to show your work, you should still listen to what some of these guys have to say and take advise if they have any to give.</p>
<p>Just like what Lin was saying: “I like to open-source the projects I take pride in, and the ones that I don’t, <span class="bbcode-b">so other people can critique me and learn from stuff I do</span>”[/quote]<br>
Off topic: Does anyone know if rolling resistance and air drag affect the car laterally? (I feel like they don’t unless you are skidding).</p>
<p>On topic: Yeah I get what you’re saying but it’s like my pride and joy and I like to have that feeling of ownership because I don’t really have too many things to call my own in real life…</p>
