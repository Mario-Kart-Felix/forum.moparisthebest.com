    <title>Multiple people working on a rsps?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/multiple-people-working-on-a-rsps/462294</link>
    <description>Is it possible to have more than one person code a server? Like my friend lives in lebbanon, and he goes to school when i am going to bed, so it is perfect for working on a server, twice the coding gets done.

So can i like send him the source and he can code,

But how do i get the stuff he coded without having to download it?

Thanks in advance!!</description>
