&lt;blockquote&gt;(March 26) - The British teen who claimed that an even younger boy fathered her child has a different story to tell after DNA test results showed young Alfie Patten wasn&#39;t the dad.

Chantelle Stedman, 15, said she had only slept with Alfie, age 13. Their story touched off international outrage over the moral standards of parents and their children.


But The Telegraph reported that other boys a few years older than Alfie had come forward saying they too had slept with Chantelle.
Now The Mirror confirms that while they don&#39;t know who is little Maisie&#39;s dad, it definitely isn&#39;t Alfie.

&quot;The result will be a blow to Alfie who was &quot;devastated&quot; by the boys&#39; claims and &quot;adored&quot; Maisie,&quot; the newspaper reported. &quot;He was convinced he was the dad after a single night of unprotected sex with Chantelle.&quot;

Stedman&#39;s daughter Maisie was allegedly conceived when Alfie was 12. Chantelle&#39;s parents said they let the lad spend the night with their daughter, who was 14 at the time, at their public housing unit near Eastbourne, 70 miles southeast of London.

Alfie told The Sun he plans to look after his newborn daughter. But in an interview, the boy admitted he didn&#39;t know what the word &quot;financially&quot; meant and acknowledged he doesn&#39;t even get an allowance.

Alfie&#39;s father, who reportedly has nine or 10 children of his own, gamely promised to have a &quot;birds and the bees&quot; chat with his son.

Not all were reassured.

Sir Bernard Ingham, once press secretary to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, told the Associated Press that people from across Britain&#39;s political spectrum are in despair over the country&#39;s social breakdown.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
