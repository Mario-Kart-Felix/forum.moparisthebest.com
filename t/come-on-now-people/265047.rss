    <description>I&#39;ve been working on coding a 317 server lately, and im having issues adding the timer for cwars... I&#39;ve coded every object... I got the pwnscape source and it &quot;had cwars&quot; but no objects worked.... stairs didn&#39;t go up or down.. portals didn&#39;t teleport.. It was a freaking joke, but ive added pretty much added every aspect of cwars, the only thing i can&#39;t figure out is:

                       HOW DO YOU ADD A TIMER! 
                                          ~A timer for the waiting lobby;
                                          ~A timer for the actual game itself;
                                          ~An interface that displays remaining time.

Also, i plan to release the source when im done with it, (cwars is probably the smallest thing i&#39;ve done to the server).

So people be excited. The first 317 with working cwars(I THINK, IVE NEVER SEEN A 317 WITH WORKING CWARS!) and much more never before seen things</description>
