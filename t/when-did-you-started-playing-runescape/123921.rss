    <title>When did you started playing runescape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/when-did-you-started-playing-runescape/123921</link>
    <description>Just curious if their are any &quot;old schoolers&quot; left.. I started a few months it opened (2001) (my account is &quot;pking&quot; in RS), and signed up at the rscheatnet forums when they were new. When did you start playing? and when you started hanging out at cheating forums? - which forum?</description>

              <p>I am not sure of the year, but I started 2 weeks after party hats were dropped. &lt;_&lt;</p>
<p>I played almost every day for about 3-4 years. Then, I took month long breaks and played for another 5 months at a time. Now, I haven’t really played in 4 months (partly because of my new job).</p>

<p>i miss the day of the 200k santas -.- my friend ended up buying one for 50k then selling it for 200k thinking it would never go up in price <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> i guess he was wrong</p>

<p>I bought a blue mask 200k when I used to play on my old account. Then lost it, and didn’t care at all. I had like 600k in the bank thinking I was rich. I wish I had that halloween mask back.</p>
