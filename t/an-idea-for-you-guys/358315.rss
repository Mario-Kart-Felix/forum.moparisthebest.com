    <title>An idea for you guys?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/an-idea-for-you-guys/358315</link>
    <description>I&#39;m just thinking, you always want the most upto date client.. right?
And then I&#39;m thinking.. well who has that? RuneScape.

So here&#39;s my idea.

If we used a packet sniffer to gather the IP for one of RuneScape&#39;s servers (a specific world).
Then edit the windows hosts file to re-direct all requests for that IP to the IP of the private server.

In essence, this would work for using a completely up-to-date client with no/little glitches?

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s within the rules of what you guys to or whatever, it&#39;s just a suggestion, shouldn&#39;t really be hard either.
I would try it myself, but I gave up on this scene once my HDD containing all my server died - unrecoverable.</description>
