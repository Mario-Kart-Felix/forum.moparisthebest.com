              <p>This was made rather quickly, I can assure you, there is more fixed on this server than any server out there, including… NPC stats, gfx, emotes, Every dungeon available, every agility shortcut usable, slayer completely redone to have every master, including kuradels dungeon. 100% working farming, hunter, agility, thieving, ect.  The only skills not 100% accurate at this time are con, and dungeoneering, we are still working on making these 100% accurate.</p>
