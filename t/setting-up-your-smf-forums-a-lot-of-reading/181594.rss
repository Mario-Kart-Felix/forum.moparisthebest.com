[b]Chapter One - Can i just skip all of this?[/b]
If your hosting has a cPanel with Fantastico then you may just be in luck, Fantastico is &lt;blockquote&gt;Use Fantastico to automatically install any of the scripts. Installing any script will use one of your available MySQL databases. Removing any script will free up one of your used MySQL databases.&lt;/blockquote&gt; If you have Fantastico  then on the left you should see &quot;Discussion Boards&quot; And under that you will see &quot;SMF&quot; Click &quot;SMF&quot;, now click &quot;[b][u]New Installation[/u][/b]&quot; you will then be prompted to enter the following details:


&quot;[b]Installation location[/b]
Install on domain [www.yourdomainhere] (Its usually already there but change if needed)
Install in directory [                ]  (I Recommend putting something like smf or forums, or if all you want on your site is forums then leave this blank)
[b]Admin Access Data[/b]
Admin access data [                ]  (Your desired username)
Admin access pass [                ]  (Your password)
[b]Base configuration[/b]
Site name   [                ] (Your site name like &quot;My Cool Forums!&quot; or just your site name)
Admin Full Name [                ] (You dont need to fill this out but it may let your users get to know you more)
Admin Email [                ] (Your eMail of coarse) 
Preferred Language [English] (usually its default is English, feel free to change this of coarse)&quot;

Then click &quot;Install SMF&quot; then a conformation screen will come up, just click &quot;Finish Installation&quot;
And your done, Its very simple using Fantastico.
[b]Note:[/b] Sometimes Fantastico does not put the correct setters (usually the language) and it will interfere with some images and wont allow proper installation of mods, To fix this go to your admin panel Click &quot;Server Settings&quot; and look for &quot;Default language&quot; If it at your desired language (other then english) then your good, If you pick English as your Defualt language earlier it will probably say &quot;English-Utf8&quot; Change it to &quot;English&quot;..

[hr]

[b]Chapter Two - Getting SMF (Simple machines forum)[/b]
Getting the SMF download for your forums is very easy, free, and requires no registration, Simple click [url=http://www.simplemachines.org/download/index.php/smf_1-1-4_install.zip]Here[/url] Or if you want to go there step by step go to www.simplemachines.org and click &quot;Download&quot; then under &quot;Full Install&quot; Click the box with the word &quot;Zip&quot; under it, this will start your download.

[hr]
[hr]

[b]Chapter 3 - Uploading your forums[/b]
Okay your going to need a FTP client to upload your forums to your web server
I use an FTP integrated into my web browser, so if your using Firefox use this FTP [url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/684]•LINK•[/url] otherwise we need to find another one, for this lets use SmartFTP [url=http://smartftp.com/download/]•Link•[/url].

Okay now, we are going to need to extract the SMF files onto your desktop, First make a folder called smf now move your downloaded forums into this folder, right click on the forums and click &quot;extract here&quot; if you dont have that option you may need WinRAR (a tool to extract zipped files) get it [url=http://www.rarlab.com/rar/wrar371.exe]here[/url].. Okay after you extracted all the files we need to actually upload them..

Lets connect to your webserver with our FTP If your using FireFtp (web browser integrated FTP) then click &quot;Manage accounts&quot; then &quot;New&quot;.. Then for Account Name put something like &quot;My Site&quot; or if you use FTP a lot uniquely name it. For host you will need your FTP connecting url (Other name: Ftp host, ftp server, FTP) For username you need your connecting username and password of course, Now click &quot;OK&quot;.

If your using SmartFtp then.. Where is says address you need your FTP connecting address for login you need your FTP username and password

Okay now lets try to find our connecting info (Ie FTP username, host)
If your host does not allow FTP connections and does not have Fantastico then you will not be able to Create your own forums.
To attempt to find your FTP info look in your hosters Control panel for something to do with FTP or something that says &quot;FTP Accounts&quot; you should then find the following info:
FTP Username:  [your FTP username]
FTP Server: [Your FTP connection server]
FTP Server Port: [your FTP port]
SFTP Server Port: [Your SFTP Port]
Mainly you just need username and server, If you just cannot find your FTP info contact your host and im sure they will be glad to help you.

Okay now lets actually upload the files.
First off find the files you extracted using your FTP client, Then copy them all and upload them to the desired spot on your webserver, I am sorry i cant really explain this, Im just having troubles trying to figure out how to explain.

Now the wait, Depending on your upload speed, uploading can take about 15 minutes or close to an hour -- [url=http://ucanr.org/filevault/calculator.htm]Upload speed Calculator[/url]

[hr]
[hr]

[b]Chapter 4 - Setting up MySql[/b]
Okay so your forums are upload, now we must configure our MySql Database (this is basically what the forums run off of)
&lt;blockquote&gt;MySql is a multithreaded, multi-user SQL database management system (DBMS) which has, according to MySQL AB, more than 10 million installations.[2] The basic program runs as a server providing multi-user access to a number of databases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay first off you lets go to the Forum installation page..

it should be something like this www.younamehere.com/smf/
or if you did not install it into a directory just www.younamehere.com

Now lets fill in the info.
[b]Basic Settings:[/b]
Forum Name: [Your Forum Name whatever you want.]
Forum URL: Just dont touch this..

Now lets jump to
[b]MySql Settings[/b]
But first lets make the MySql Database
Go to your hosting control panel and click &quot;MySQL Databases&quot;
Okay now we are going to name this Database &quot;SMF&quot; (no quotes)
So in the spot where it says &quot;Database Creation&quot; put the name &quot;SMF&quot; then click &quot;Create Database&quot; it should say sometihng along the lines of:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Create MySQL database[/b]

Added the database SMF.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now we need to create a user for the MySQL Database to do this go back to your MYSQL Databases area.
Scroll down a little and under &quot;[b]Add New User[/b]&quot;
lets make the username &quot;forums&quot; (lowercase, no quotes)
make the password whatever you want, but remember it! We will need it again in a few minutes..

okay after you put in the username and password click &quot;Create User&quot;
it should then say
&lt;blockquote&gt;MySQL Users

Added user forums with the password *****(it will show your pass).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay now the last part of MySQL creation, adding the user we just created to the Database [i]SMF[/i] we created earlier..

Go back to your MySQL Databases Main area and scroll down to &quot;[b]Add User To Database[/b]&quot; and on the pull down menu find the username &quot;forums&quot; it may have something in front of it.. [i]For example, my website name is funpking so my MySQL database users look like: funpking_forums..[/i] anyway once you find it select it, Now beneath the usernames should be out Databases find the database we created earlier [i](SMF)[/i] once again it may have something in front of it like your site name..
Then click &quot;Submit&quot;
A manage user privileges screen may come up, if it does check mark &quot;All Privileges&quot; then click &quot;Make Changes&quot; it should say something along the lines of..
&lt;blockquote&gt;User [sitename]_[username] was added to the database [sitename]_SMF.

Make sure to specify the user and database exactly as written above. Mysql&#39;s server name is localhost.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Okay now we are done creating the MySQL Database, now lets plug it in where it needs to be, Go back to your forum setup page, and scroll down to &quot;[b]MySQL Server Settings[/b]&quot; and make it look like this:

[b]MySQL server name:[/b] [localhost]
[b]MySQL username:[/b] [the username we created earlier, remember it may have your sitename in front of it]
[b]MySQL password:[/b] [The password we just created]
[b]MySQL database name:[/b] [the database name we just created]
[b]MySQL table prefix:[/b] [leave the same]

Then click &quot;Proceed&quot;

You will then be brought to the next screen to create your forums account, what to put is self explanatory and user created..

And your done! You have successfully set up your forum!..
