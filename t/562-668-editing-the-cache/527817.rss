    <title>562/668 Editing the Cache</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-668-editing-the-cache/527817</link>
    <description>Hi,

I wanted to edit the cache of my 668 cache. I found several cache editors but they all have had errors reading them. Is there anyone who has a 667+ cache editor which works and is easy to use? All i want to do is change the background and logo.

Thank You.</description>
