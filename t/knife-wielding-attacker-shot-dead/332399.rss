    <title>Knife-Wielding Attacker Shot Dead</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/knife-wielding-attacker-shot-dead/332399</link>
    <description>[quote=&quot;http://www.wreg.com/news/wreg-man-with-knife-shot-dead,0,2103052.story&quot;](Memphis 3/5/10) Chaos erupted at a Family Dollar store when a man with a knife chased customers and was shot dead.

Witnesses at the store near Delano and North Watkins say the attacker picked the wrong victim.

&quot;He got what he deserved,&quot; says one woman. &quot;It&#39;s as simple as that.&quot;

Police say a man with a knife raced through the parking lot just after 3:00 p.m.. Witnesses say the man chased a delivery driver and others, but was killed when he tried to lunge his knife at one driver leaving the parking lot. The driver pulled a gun and killed his attacker on the spot.

&quot;I just seen him shoot down. I thought he was just shooting in the ground. Obviously, he was shooting the gentleman with the knife,&quot; says Byron Cook who watched the ordeal from start to finish, along with his three year-old grandson.

Witnesses say two little girls were inside the car when the attacker lunged at the driver.

&quot;He had his two step-daughters in the car with him. So, he really was trying to look out for them when he shot him,&quot; says Brandon Jones, who says the girls appeared to be younger than ten. &quot;Yeah, they saw everything that happened. One of them was real shaken.&quot;

Jones heard roughly six shots, then saw the man on the ground with the butcher knife still in hand. Witnesses can&#39;t make sense of the attacker&#39;s motive, but they&#39;re certain the shooting was self-defense.

&quot;He did the right thing by taking care of his business,&quot; says Jones. &quot;The girls are safe.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got to protect yourself,&quot; says Cook. &quot;He had his two kids in the car and they were terrified.&quot;

&quot;Self defense,&quot; says one woman. &quot;That&#39;s what I would have done, the same thing.&quot;

Witnesses say the shooter was stabbed, but appeared to be okay. Police have not released the name of the attacker.[/quote]

And you ask me why I carry a gun everywhere I go, ha!  This crazy was out to kill anyone he could, he wouldn&#39;t have cared if the cops were there, or if you gave him your wallet.  He wanted to kill anyone and there is only one way to stop someone like that, self defense.

I subscribe to the RSS feed at this site: http://www.thearmedcitizen.com/  Thousands of great, real life stories where guns are used legally in self defense every day. :)</description>

<p>No it doesn’t. It puts guns in the hands of criminals (and the police force) which isn’t ideal, but “those people who can’t keep themselves in check” is not restricted to criminals.[/quote]<br>
You have to get alot of permits to carry even an unloaded gun on you, so id imagine someone who has anger problems couldn’t get a gun very easily due to medical/therapy records.</p>

<p>Of course, witness testimony isn’t really reliable, but that’s sure what it looks like.</p>
<p>None of us really know unless we were there, I’ll concede that.</p>
<p>My point is that while it’s a nice idea to use this as a reason for allowing citizens to carry, it’s ultimately similar to the anti-drug prohibition argument - makes perfect sense in some kind of utopia where everyone except a select few bad eggs are upstanding pillars of society, but we don’t live in that world. Think of all the retarded videos on youtube of people fighting on buses and whatnot and how many of those would end in death if we all carried a gun just because some people have no self-control.</p>

<p>Earlier in this thread I said something in the lines of “this is bad bla bla”. I agree with Mopman, shooting someone who is down is just wrong. But I don’t think you can blame a person when he does that. It’s all about the temper of the person defending himself. If you have a short temper, and you and your kids are under attack, I bet you lose control and go berserk with your gun.</p>

FWIW, i never said you should shoot him in the hand, thats absurd. I said that leaning over and unloading into him when he’s already incapacitated is not right.<br>

<p>Fixd. Yz this isnt aimed at you, you just posted. Just because you shoot someone doesnt mean they will stop and fall to the floor. I’m sure there is some person who has survived multiple shots to ‘fatal’ areas and was still able to do something. I’m not saying the defender should unload the whole clip into someone but whos to say that the attacker may get back up again?</p>

For all of you guys screaming about shooting someone in the hand, legs, or anywhere else besides the torso, fuck off already. Nobody goes out of their way to make a headshot anymore because the head is usually deemed too hard to hit, given its smaller size. How absurd would it be to aim for something smaller like a hand?<br>
ITT: An overly forgiving userbase voices their concerns about something that they know fuck all about. I hope you all know that your assailant, if you’re ever placed in a situation like this, will not be so forgiving.</p>
