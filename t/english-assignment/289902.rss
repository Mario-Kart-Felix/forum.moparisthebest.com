Part One &quot;why we crave horror movies&quot; by Stephen King Pg340 of [b]&quot;Readers Choice 5th Canadian Edition by Kim Flachmann, Michael Flachmann and Alexandra MacLennan&quot;[/b]

- discuss the meaning of King&#39;s concluding sentence, using details from the text. You may use examples of horror movies not mentioned in the text you choose to.


Part Two &quot;The cask of Amontillado&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe

&quot;In pace requiescat!&quot; (translation: Rest In Peace)
What is the significance of Montresor&#39;s final words? Your answer must refer to the rest of the story.

thanks once again</description>

          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>The third and final example of irony in The Cask of Amontillado takes place when Montresor realizes that Fortunato is dead. After repeatedly calling Fortunato’s name, Montresor collects himself and says, “In pace requiescat,” which translates as “rest in peace.” While this itself does seem a bit ironic since Montresor kills Fortunato and then wishes him peace, it can’t yet be fully appreciated. In Italian “in pace requiescat” does translate as “rest in peace,” but the phrase, “in pace” by itself means a, “secure, monastic prison.” This description very well represents Fortunato’s final resting place – secure because it is deep underground and behind a brick wall, and monastic because it’s location is very secluded and almost has a religious air about it because of the human remains scattered about.</blockquote>
