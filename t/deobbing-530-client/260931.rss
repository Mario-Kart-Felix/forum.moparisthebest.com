    <title>Deobbing 530 client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/deobbing-530-client/260931</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;m new around here but I&#39;ve been playing around with private servers and client mods since MoparScape was created. I lost interest a few years back, but since the new, &quot;HD&quot; client I was thinking of messing around with it. So I downloaded the latest jar, ran it through Popcorn&#39;s deobber, and corrected some of the errors with it, such as the &lt;error&gt; to int[] issues. 

I&#39;m stuck with hundreds of &quot;Class124.method1702&quot; issues, and Class138 does not exist, and some &quot;Invalid arguments to ++/--&quot;. That is referring to the line &quot;int i_23_ = ---i_14_ + i_10_;&quot;

Anyone have experience with this client? I&#39;ve searched but didn&#39;t find anything. I would like to have a modern client to refactor completely, if possible. If not, can anyone show me the way to the latest client that can compile properly?</description>

<p>Popcorn does deob it perfectly, just use the deob-jad for the Class124 <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I’ve replaced those parts already, but there are some missing methods, namely methods 1702, 1703, 1704 and 1705, all from Class124. Also there is a class, Class138, missing. Has the deobber broken or the decompiler “dropped” these parts?</p>
<p>When I attempt to run it ignoring the compile issues I get:</p>
<p>Error: Applet_Sub1.method28:1119 Applet_Sub1.run:1291 java.lang.Thread.run | java.lang.NullPointerException<br>

<p>[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 07, 2009, 04:40:39 pm[/size][hr]I fixed part of this but I have run across a second problem:</p>
<p>Popcorn’s deobber was not working properly, and for some reason the file Class138 wasn’t being handled properly. I decompiled manually and now it’s fine.</p>
<p>My second problem is Class124: It appears that the end of it is cut off, and so can’t be compiled properly. I am not sure why but it is incredibly long, does Jad have a length limit? I’m going to give it a go through jode and see what happens. I’ll post back here if I get it working. Does anyone have a JAGGRAB server (unless I’m mistaken, I need something like this) working for 530? I haven’t been keeping up to date recently.</p>
<p>EDIT:::<br>
Fixed it, Jad had left off the end of Class124 for some odd reason. It now compiles and runs properly, and is asking for an update server… I’m guessing I take it over to the OTHER forum from now on? If anyone wants it once I finish refactoring, email or PM me.</p>
