    <description>Windows Vista (x64).  (Linksys router)

K, as you can see; I&#39;m having problems with people connecting to my server.  

I portforwarded correctly, I have Gotten a Static-IP, I did everything that any tutorial has told me to do.
I got my no-ip, but idk if i set the IP right in the client.  If you only set the IP in client.java, and you set that to your no-ip, then I did it right.
I am using the Ember-Scape Base.

I also have tried using Utorrent.  Does not work.  Everything stops at connecting to update server EVERY time I run this.  Once again, I set the IP right, and Yes, I know how to connect to it, But no one else can? wtf...

Anyway, can someone please help?  Teamviwer is an option.  Thanks.</description>
