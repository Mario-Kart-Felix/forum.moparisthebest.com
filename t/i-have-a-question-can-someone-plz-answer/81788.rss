    <description>Im making a new server and i was reading the ultimate and ran into this.                                                                                                                                                       Now log into the router and go into &quot;advanced&quot; (at top of screen on mine). Then on the sidebar to the left click the &quot;gaming&quot; button (is only left side for me...) Then you need to make a new rule and fill in the blanks with this information.

Now i logged into my router, but where is advance on his screen he saying?</description>
