    <description> :mad:

i have read the sticky about what to do if u can&#39;t log on but i still cant log on to any server
I updated my java when mopar was first installed
I have hamachi and had no problem connecting with the network with many different networks connected
I have tried over 20 different servers today and none have worked
I did check the ip and the port and they were correc each time

if anyone can help me it would be very much appreciated and sorry to have to end up posting it here</description>
