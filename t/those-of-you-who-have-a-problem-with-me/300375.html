<p>I’ll bet it’s because you think that I think I’m a Java Guru. Ugh, no, I’m far from a Java Guru. Although, I’m not your “average noob” around here. I know a lot more about programming in java then most of the people in these communitys, but there are also a lot of people that know way more about not just java but other languages, but I tend to stick with object oriented programming languages, such as java.</p>
<p>Followed on from that, you still see me as the moparscape noob from 2007/2008, even me reading back on some of my first posts makes me want to slap myself a few times and maybe even pull the trigger. However I learn more and more every day because I’m one of the few people who actually want to become a great programmer some day not a moron who rips off from other people, everyone starts out dumb then works up to a smarter and smarter position. Right now that’s what I’m doing I’m working my way up, and rather, eh, slowly. Not many people realize what I have learned and such over the past year. I guess where I went wrong is being isolated to my friends on MSN, and not being more open sourced to show people my work.</p>
<p>I do expect more flame from this thread, obviously, but I would appreciate it if you just realize I’m not still that moron from years ago.</p>
<p>So explain to me what you’re issue is with me.</p>
