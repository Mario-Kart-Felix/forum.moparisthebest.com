              <p>client folder&lt;client.java&lt;control+f search <code>server =</code><br>
you will find this when downloading the client: <code>server = "127.0.0.1";</code><br>
you need to make an account on <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> and add a host, then put the host ip where 127.0.0.1 is, example: <code>server = "example.no-ip.org";</code><br>
And if your router hosting then you need to go onto your router and add it to your “portforwarding tab”= <a href="http://prntscr.com/2a9wu" rel="nofollow noopener">http://prntscr.com/2a9wu</a> Yes is do understand all router will most likely look different but, im just showing an example ;p, now you need to add something close to this: <a href="http://prntscr.com/2a9x9" rel="nofollow noopener">http://prntscr.com/2a9x9</a> the ip’s will be different to figure out yours go to start&lt;run…&lt;cmd&lt;type “ipconfig” and it will show your default gateway adress, (you put your ip4adress on your no-ip host) then go into gui.java and search “ip” and you will get something like: <code>UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
			sign.signlink.startpriv(InetAddress.getByName("example.no-ip.org"));</code><br>
change <code>example.no-ip.org</code> to your no-ip. and wallah. (i think xD) just started hosting myself.         -might be abit different because this is with an router but, im sure there wouldn’t be much to change with hamachi if so, then just ignore this post…</p>
