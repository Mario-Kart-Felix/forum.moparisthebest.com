    <description>Well I&#39;m trying to host my server with utorrent (Ik it&#39;s bad, but I&#39;m just wanting to try it because I can&#39;t seem to do it w/o it. Same problem happens anyway), but I&#39;m not too sure what to do. What Ip do I put in my client? My no-ip? What ip do I put in the server where it says &quot;Server listening on port ******:43594&quot;? I just need help REALLY bad, so if you could help then thanks :)

              <p>Remember, that same client is NOT what you send to others, YOURS will be server = “127.0.0.1”;<br>
Others will be server = "yoursetup <a href="http://noip.no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">noip.no-ip.org</a><br>
Hope this clears some confusion</p>

127.0.0.1 is the IP you should use in your Client. I recommend you don’t try to host it with other people accessing it until you’re more experienced.<br>

<p>Exactly what I asked for! And I had no idea how to put localhost in, THANKS![/quote]</p>
