    <title>Why encrypt opcodes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-encrypt-opcodes/554213</link>
    <description>Hey,

I&#39;m sorry if this topic is in the wrong board, but I couldn&#39;t find a board that was better for my question.

I&#39;m looking around in different github repo&#39;s and I found a lot of servers that use isaac cipher to encrypt and decrypt opcodes. I&#39;m wondering why this is happening. I searched around on Google and on this forum, and I haven&#39;t found a lot of information about this. I was wondering if someone could give me a brief explanation why a lot of developers do this, and why this is needed.

The reason I&#39;m wondering about this is because i&#39;m interested in rsps development. I have experience with Java an netty and i&#39;m hoping to maybe ever build my own RSPS server. For that, I of course want to know every aspect of it.

              <p>Everyone other than Mopman has done an impressive job of not actually answering what the OP asked</p>
<p>[quote=“woutiboy, post:6, topic:554213”]So what I understand of the comments below is that the actual reason that ISAAC is used to encrypt/decrypt packets is because it’s faster than RSA (and a RSPS can potentially have a lot of traffic coming in/out) and to protect whatever data is coming from the user or is going to the user.

<p>Is this correct? <span class="bbcode-i">English isn’t my native language :x</span>[/quote]</p>
<p>No. ISAAC is used to encrypt frame opcodes because it makes it more difficult for bots to listen to or tamper with frames exchanged between the client and server. The seed used by the cipher is created at runtime, so if you want to decrypt a frame opcode, you have to dynamically obtain the seed currently in use. If ISAAC was not used, the frame opcodes would be the same for every client (although the opcodes would change every revision, as Jagex does and has always scrambled them every client build), and so you could trivially identify frames simply by listening to traffic.</p>
<p>RSA is used to encrypt sensitive parts of the login data (username, password, ISAAC seed, more in newer clients) because with a decent key size it is effectively unbreakable; however, as Mopman mentioned, it is fairly slow, so you don’t want to be doing this for every frame exchanged between the client and server.</p>

              <p>to be honest most rsps null the RSA key part so the entire encryption is a bit useless basically RSPS have the encryption still in the client and server because everyone was too lazy to remove it or implement it properly. its in the client to protect login data from network sniffing and to protect the game from packet bots.</p>

              <p>They encrypt the login packets with RSA for the reason you say - to protect the user data in transmission. RSA is slow, though, so for the opcodes they seed an ISAAC instance, send the seed in the RSA packet as ‘protected’ data, and then use that to obscure the opcodes.</p>
<p>It’s to prevent bots tampering with the traffic without having access to the ISAAC seed - ie. they force you to be ‘in client’ where they can try to detect you. You can’t do a proxy bot like Autorune running on a remote machine without something in the client grabbing stuff and potentially leaving fingerprints so to speak.</p>
