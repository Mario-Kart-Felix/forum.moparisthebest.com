Check this out. This is a custom coded forum that some dude made, letting people control the whole forum. You can pick what forums you want or what mods you want etc. You can win rapidshare accounts too just by posting. Here&#39;s some explanation posts from the forum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On first glance, you may think that this forum is just another run of the mill discussion board. Put quite simply - it&#39;s not.

This forum is completely controlled by user input. Every board made (aside from the few permanent ones), every moderator hired and every post deleted is controlled entirely by the userbase.

This is achieved using two special boards. Moderator management and Forum management. These boards contain voting systems that allow users to create/remove boards and moderators.

Admins will not participate in the censorship of users, unless illegal content is posted. This is the only &quot;rule&quot; in Clamocracy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have quite a bit of money left over from our site budget, so we&#39;ve decided to have a little giveaway lasting a few weeks to make activity a bit more fun and rewarding.

What are the prizes? All sorts of accounts on all sorts of filesharing sites! From rapidshare, to megaupload to gamespot! 1 month membership each, although we may (small chance) extend that if this works well. We do accept suggestions for the prizes, or if you prefer we can just send you the equivalent prize worth in USD (PayPal).

Here&#39;s how to play:

User Points
Depending on the quality of your post, you will receive a certain number of points for it. Soon you will be able to turn in these points for prizes, so stock up.

Posting
The more you post, the higher your chance of winning. There are two ways to win while posting.

The server randomly picks a poster every once in a while, kind of like a lottery. Each post you make entitles you to one entry into the lottery. For example, if there are a total of 5,000 posts and 1,000 of them are yours, you have a 1000 in 5000 chance of winning.

The other method is simple, every 1,000 posts (may be changed if it gets too popular) is a winner. For example, lets say there are currently 3,864 total posts. The person to post the 4,000th message will win.

There will be other methods of winning such as referrals in the near future. Feel free to PM me to suggest things or if you experience any problems.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
