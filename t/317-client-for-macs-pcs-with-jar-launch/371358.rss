    <title>317 Client for Macs &amp; Pcs with Jar Launch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-client-for-macs-pcs-with-jar-launch/371358</link>
    <description>My problem is I am hosting a server for many mac users (came from a great 508 mac server) and now many are playing my 317. To make a client universal, I need it to run from a .jar, but I would like the ability to edit the client and not have it all compiled to a single .jar for anti-leech or whatever it&#39;s used for.  I would also prefer a client that has

-God swords with Specs

-Dragon claws (on rune claws) with Spec

-All skillcapes

-Many to All 474 emotes


Does anybody know of such a client? If there isn&#39;t one, could someone tell me how to make a terminal command to have any 317 client work on a Mac (which is 64 bit)? 

I do not wish to sound like a begger  :| I have been looking for a few months (yes, months since october) for a good client to start with, but have not found any :(


Thank you very much.

P.S. I am on a Mac and have worked with Mac Hosting for quite some time now. I&#39;m disappointed I couldn&#39;t solve this problem.</description>
