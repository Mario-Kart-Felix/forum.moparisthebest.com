    <title>Need help with 2 things</title>

    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;ve been having trouble lately with two problems. Not so much problems but things I need help with.
1. Many people ask this question all the time but from some of the topics there aren&#39;t many replies. How do you make your player follow the person your attacking while ranging. Like in runescape the player ranging would run after the person still firing. How do I make that happen? If you know or even have the slightest idea please post.

2. Interfaces--
   Now I&#39;m not sure if these are custom interfaces but they seem so. I&#39;ll show you.

(I found these pictures on the server status page)
Things like that. How do I do that. If anyone knows how please tell me. Because I&#39;ve seen the Pest control interface in 2Speced and I really wanted to use it. And the other one I could use for many other interfaces such as Assault, etc.


Thanks for reading and please reply. Thank you. :)
