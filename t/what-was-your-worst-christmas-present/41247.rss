    <title>What was your worst christmas present?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-was-your-worst-christmas-present/41247</link>
    <description>I know this is a bit late but I was banned so I couldn&#39;t post. (Obviously.)
So I was just wondering, what was your worst present you received and/or gave this Christmas?

Mine was a big book of knots. It described 200 knots and how to tie them which I thought was really crap.

So just post your crappy presents. :D</description>

<p>Actually It’s probably because you didn’t get a really crappy present. Don’t call me an ungrateful shit because I didn’t like one of my presents, what, am I supposed to absolutely love every single one of my presents? I was simply saying that I didn’t like it.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Gotta Catch Them All, post:1, topic:41247”]I know this is a bit late but I was banned so I couldn’t post. (Obviously.)<br>
So I was just wondering, what was your worst present you received and/or gave this Christmas?</p>
<p>Mine was a big book of knots. It described 200 knots and how to tie them which I thought was really crap.</p>
<p>So just post your crappy presents. :D[/quote]<br>
Lol, looks like my sister got this very same book and she hated it too.</p>
<p>My worst… well definitely some kind of winnie teh pooh figure with some awful candy in it.</p>
