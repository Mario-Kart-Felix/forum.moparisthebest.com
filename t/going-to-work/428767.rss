    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/going-to-work/428767</link>
    <description>In about 10 minutes I&#39;m about to go to work with my father, he is a truck driver and asked me if I wanted to go for the day. 

So my question is, Have you ever gone to work with your mum or dad? If so, to what job? If not, would you?</description>

              <p>Umm, I’ve went to work with my dad back when I was 7 or 8 years old at a bowling alley. I was related to the manager as well. I always got free change to go play games, and if there was a lane open, he would turn it on so I could bowl lol. Was great, did that many times.</p>

              <p>My dad is the Manager of the Derpartment of Management at Petroglyph National Monument here near where I live. Its quite interesting because there are dormant volcanoes here and there is a 17 mile long escarpment of volcanic rock that as indian pictures “petroglyphs” to “communicate” with their spirits. In general though, the geological, geographical and historic parts of the part is quite fascinating. I have volunteered there since i was 8 and I am about to be highered working for my dad at $11.50 an hour 8 hours a day for the whole 3 month summer. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

<p>Anyways, I go with my dad to the car dealership he works at and clean the floors in the mechanics’ shop. Makes $50 flat, which I use to pay my phone bill normally. Its also pretty easy, my job is just to sweep water out of the area :rolleyes: I also get to see the Mopar label just about everywhere I look aside from the heater in there.</p>
