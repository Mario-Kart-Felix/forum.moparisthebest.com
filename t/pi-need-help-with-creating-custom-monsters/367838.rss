    <title>[PI] Need help with creating custom monsters</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-help-with-creating-custom-monsters/367838</link>
    <description>I just changed the IDs for the GWD NPCs, but they don&#39;t seem to work. The new IDs would spawn some random NPC instead of the GWD NPCs that they are suppose to spawn... any idea on why this occurs?</description>

              <p>well this has to do with adding npcs too such as corp and tds, so either way, i would need to know why the new ids wont work. i also like to know why things work or dont work, dont rlly like to leach.</p>

              <p>why did you change the id’s in the first place? most likely it IS the monster but since you only changed the id / name the client still shows models/gfx/anims of the previous monster. If i were you id just change id’s back? unless u have a good reason for them to be different.</p>
