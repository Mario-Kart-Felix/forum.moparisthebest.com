    <title>[req]Looking For A Render[req]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-looking-for-a-render-req/292434</link>
    <description>Hey guys, sorry about the vague subject, but I am in desperate need of help. Me and a friend of mine are making a clan for a gaming community and we are in desperate need of a clan logo. So what I am hoping is that some people would like to be creative and give this a whirl. It can be anything you want it to be, but the letters PiF in the middle of it. Also it would be great if people could get it in a pretty good detail. And then if the people taking this challenge want a little bit more fun, if you could make it look icy and maybe have some icicles or something hanging off the bottom, that would be extremely cool.

Also, can it please be rendered without a background so that way if you let us use one of your creations, it can blend into the background without having a whitebox or something behind it.

              <p>Like… I was looking for someone to model a logo and then render it… so that way the logo is 3D on the entrance page to the community. And yes I am hoping because I cant really force someone to do this. And yeah… A modeling program like meta, 3ds, or blender (preferably the latter 2).</p>
