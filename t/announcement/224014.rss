    <description>Well, Sorry to say this but im out, Im only a 14 year old coder and ill admit, im not the best, and  i havent leeched once, and I also havent been accused of leaching at all, But this forum is pointless? I mean, you open up a link and you get a vid of a guy sucking another guys Dick? and its a racist post? I mean come on, Mods need to step up there game because there are kids who make newbie serevrs and come here for tuts and what not, i meen i can take it im a mature teen but come on now, is there really a need for stupid posts like that? and they dont even get locked?!?! but then the people double posting get locked, i posted a TUT on how to create a server router free and it got locked because someone else already posted it (sorry stormcutter) but when someone posts a pornographic link it stays up? Mopar is a GREAT forum for Coding advise, Tutorials and downloads, but when you see a thing like that, it just makes you want to move on to bigger and better things, i meen sorry mopar, but until ur staff starts doing there job, im going to have to move to the smaller communities.

              <p>The reason is:</p>
<p>8 year old find runescape<br>
runescape r cool.<br>
he want gp.<br>
he goes on youtube<br>
sees guides and stuff<br>
find moparscape<br>
ppl in vid spawn d chains<br>
he want to play<br>
he google moparscape<br>
he come here<br>
…</p>
<p>That is why this community is the retard of them all, they are DIRECTLY linked here, other branch off sites are found differently, by searching things you actually know about.</p>
<p>Anyway, simply hold you mouse over any link, and in the bottom left hand corner of your browser you will see where it goes.<br>
Besides, NO links are supposed to be posted at all unless they’re download links.</p>
<p>Everyone here is required to be spoon fed, and when they arent spoon fed they give up and go ranting and spamming the forums saying its stupid. (Normally after that they go and slam there door and cry in there pillow).</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Just stay with the intell. people.</p>
<p>P.S: some people here are noobs but arent that bad, if you explain everything then they know what to look for, you just point them in the right direction and they will search from there. Dont be like most people and:</p>
<p>simple question</p>
<blockquote>Yes um well how doi run my server.bat thingy?/?????????????????????</blockquote>
<p>lame answer, user is muted.</p>
<blockquote>AHAHAHAAHAAH SIGED</blockquote>
<blockquote>[code]

pause
[/code]

</blockquote>
<blockquote>Ye i fix ty so muhc :) :))))!</blockquote>
