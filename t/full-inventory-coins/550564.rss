<p>Okay so you are correct.</p>
<p>27 items in inventory with coins<br>

So, now tell us more about your source? Is it 317, 474, 508, 525, 562, 602, 666, 667, 718, 734, 800+, etc.</p>
<p>Provide us with related code, as well.</p>
<p>And it helps to show that you’re actually <span class="bbcode-i">trying</span> to fix this. Instead of just posting “Hey I have a problem how do I fix it”, show that you’ve made some initiative to fix it yourself. Tell us what you’ve tried and etc.</p>

<p>Looks like what OP is asking is this:<br>
Player has coins in inventory.<br>
Player also has all other 27 slots full with other items and etc.<br>
Player attempts to receive coins (Was not specified HOW they’re getting the coins, via picking up or a skill reward or etc etc).<br>
Player gets message saying inventory is full, even though the coins can stack on the ones in inventory.</p>
<p>and the issue is that he wants to be able to get the coins even though it’s “full”<br>

OP, we need more information. Please read the first link in my signature and then edit your post. It will really help us help you</p>
