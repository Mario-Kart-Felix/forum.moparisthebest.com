    <description>So I keep trying to open port 43594 , but when I use the canyouseeme.org it says connection refused. I have had it say successful once but then went to connection refused 2 minutes later.
My router is a belkin , but when I type my default gateaway it takes me to zyxel.
If anyone can help I would really appreciate it :)</description>
