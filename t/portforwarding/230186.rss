    <description>Hey, I have problems with portforwarding my Belkin F5D9630-4 Router, Ive tried portforward.com , Its not clear to me, I cannot make a static ip cos i dont understand theyre wording of it, and apparently i need a static IP for it to work..

Also, my Ipconfig dosent work, But yet Run serv and compile work... :l
