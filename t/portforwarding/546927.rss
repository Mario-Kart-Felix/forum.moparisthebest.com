              <p>For those of you saying, “contact me on Skype” don’t… It’s better to solve problems in-thread in case someone else comes up with the same problem. Anyways s2k0r, skip NO-IP, it just adds in a middle man that is pointless, plus a majority of No-IP masked addresses have been compromised (there’s a thread on it under general announcements or whatever). Things to remember/check when port-forwarding…</p>
<p>[ul][li]No-IP is not required, it just masks your IP address, which is essentially pointless in most cases.[/li]<br>
[li]Make sure the client is connecting to the correct IP and port.[/li]<br>
[li]Make sure you have port-forwarded the correct port, and make sure it’s forwarding to the correct local address.[/li]<br>
[li]If you’re running from a VPS, or a home computer, or other scenarios, you may need to allow the port to bypass your computer’s firewall. This is mostly the case with VPS’, but can sometimes be normal computers.[/li]<br>
[li]There is also a router firewall, normally with port forwarding, it’s a way of bypassing the router firewall, but from some routers, that’s not the case.[/li]<br>
[li]This is a given… but make sure your server is running and listening on the correct port.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Hopefully some of these tips can help you out, let me know.</p>
