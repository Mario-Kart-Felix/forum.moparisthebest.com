my server is running, still it doesnt seem to work. i have tried adding it to the server status list, says its not up. i have also put the ip and port in my own little server status list and it says its offline as well, and yeh pretty much idk what to do anymore, if u would like to try it urself my server will be running just about all day, being the fact that it doesnt lag my computer when NO ONE CAN GET ON! :P the ip is up there if u would like to try. please help? :)</description>
