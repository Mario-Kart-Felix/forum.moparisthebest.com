    <title>How to Make objects tele you.. and make objects</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-objects-tele-you-and-make-objects/125521</link>
    <description>[b]hello, i have recen;lty seen lot&#39;s of threads like: how i make portals tele me?? etc
so i have made this thread.

Difficulty: 3/10

Assumed Knowledge: a Brain.. if you have one..

Classes Modified: , Client.Java


first of all

[u]MAKING OBJECTS[/u] [/b]

Look in Client.Java for something like this..

[code]makeGlobalObject(3690, 3471, 3206, -1, 10);//Barrel[/code]
i think this is cxoded on my server and i highly doubt you have the same barrel id and co-ords so just do makeglobalobject..
so under that if i wanted a hay bale for Example i&#39;d type:
[code]makeGlobalObject(XCORD, YCORD, OBJECTID, -1, 10);//OBJECT NAME[/code]

Exit, Compile.. Then their is a w/e object their..
Hope it helps ~~


[b][u]MAKING SPAWNED OBJECTS TELE YOU.[/u]

Classes Modified :  Client.Java

Assumed Knowledge : half a brain O.O


Difficulty 1/10

Ok, look in ur Client.Java for something like this..

[code]case WHATTELESYOU? E.G PREACH FROM HOLY BOOK THE ID OF BOOK..:
sendMessage(&quot;WHAT IT SAYS AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN TELED.&quot;);
teleportToX = CO-ORD;
teleportToY = CO-ORD;
heightLevel = 0;
updateRequired = true; 
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
break;		
[/code]

Copy and Paste a Code like this But at the Start of the command it says case then the object ID:

so like [code]case E.G A Portal id which you made Earlier..[/code]

I hope you now enjoy Adding Objects!
and teleing! 

=D


Creds : me..
