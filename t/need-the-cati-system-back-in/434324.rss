    <description>Were getting a flood of noob players and greifers coming in to W2, and soon WC.
I think a pay system must be replaced or admins are going to get bogged down with reports.</description>

              <p>But I made the change the same time I upgraded to 1.2, so was it the cacti limit that caused all these reports?  Or was it the upgrade to the current version of minecraft that allowed griefers to get on?</p>
<p>As to banning players when they are not online, I’ll have a good fix for that tomorrow.</p>

              <p>Opening this up to community would not be a good idea, the noob/ greifing players are in mass right now. Of course they don’t want it.</p>
<p>It comes down to a staff decision.<br>
That system was a good filter to keep greifing down, with it down just for the small time it has been we’ve had triple the greif reports that have taken admin’s time to solve.<br>
Also with the issue of not being able to ban players unless they are online these players can continue to greif openly.</p>
<p>I say put some type of system back in.</p>
