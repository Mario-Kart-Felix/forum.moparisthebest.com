    <description>If any of you watch WhatsupwithRS, you&#39;ve probably seen this Video
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdzQfTYsN70

Don&#39;t be fooled by idiots like him, much like JaGeX, RSbuddy &amp; RSbot make money off what they develop.  All of the cocky legit players that are bragging and trolling on the RSbuddy forums need to learn what you are talking about before you make videos like this.

Like any company, JaGeX isn&#39;t perfect, there will always be glitches and holes in their game and people to exploit them.  Thinking that botters who make tens of thousands of dollars developing will just say &quot;oh, they ruined the reflection system, we quit&quot; is idiotic.

Here&#39;s a quote from the lead developer of RSbuddy
[quote=&quot;Jacmob&quot;]This week&#39;s update has brought some interesting internal changes to RuneScape. The game now requires a newer version of Java (which almost all of you will have already installed) and has therefore been able to shed some old code to make room for technical and graphical improvements!

Jagex has also mentioned to a few people that this update includes new &#39;anti-botting&#39; technology. As a result over 10,000 of our users have come to our forums all at once to check on the progress in updating RSBuddy! It is true that this update will require some bigger changes than usual in order for bots to be back up and running smoothly. I am going to conduct a more thorough review of the update and I&#39;ll be updating you on my progress by updating this thread.

Please check back in a few minutes for an estimated update time once my update review is complete.

Update: Today&#39;s update leaves a reasonable amount of work required to update the bot, but this will be easily manageable. I also plan to develop new software that will make further updates of this kind easier to manage.[/quote]

I&#39;m not saying that the RSbuddy Devs are better than JaGeX, but people need to stop thinking that this is the end of all bots forever, even simple programs such as Mouse Recorder Pro can be used to bot.

Also, regarding the whole &quot;Triple rewards week&quot; thing;
I have no doubt that they are only doing it to make sure that no one thinks the game will die.  Bots probally make up 3/4 of all players, that&#39;s a decently large chunk.

To the people saying &quot;You&#39;re just some mad kid who can&#39;t bot any more lmao&quot;:
I&#39;m not mad, and I already quit botting about 6 months ago, I just think that those who think this is the end of bots need to learn how these things work.

To the people asking &quot;Why not just take down the site(s)?&quot;:
There&#39;s a quote from Jacmob I couldn&#39;t find (forgot where it was), but RSbuddy shares lawyers with movie studios and some major production sets, and are commonly considered some of the best lawyers in the UK.  If JaGeX wanted to go to court with them over a simple In-Game rule violation (not a law), they would be ready.  

I know many of you hope bots don&#39;t come back, in a way I wish they would thin out some (yes I admit some over do it by botting on like 5 accounts at once), I&#39;m just defending the community I love.  Many project botters as lazy bastards who are below 12 and are just to lazy to do work.  As it turns out, most are them actually are smarter than 95% of RuneScape players I&#39;ve ever met.  If they don&#39;t enjoy beating their brains out for a month just to go pking for 2 days, then they&#39;ll find a smarter way, and botting just so happened to be a solution.

I&#39;m not projecting legit players as dumb, I respect them, but they&#39;re in no position to judge or insult botters for any reason.

To end this, here&#39;s one last quote I found
[quote=&quot;SeverSFSs&quot;]Also botters did nothing to hurt the players who played for real. The only reason they complained was because they werent as rich as the bots. It didnt degrade their levels at all, bots have no advantage at all except time. Bots just shorten time. You dont get a limited edition sword for botting........[/quote]</description>

jacmob etc<br>

yep<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Frell Bzigalsmichtz says</span><br>
are trying to keep their community calm<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Yohanu says</span><br>
i expected them to go this far<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Frell Bzigalsmichtz says</span><br>
by saying “oh ill have it in a few hours”<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Yohanu says</span><br>
eventually<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Frell Bzigalsmichtz says</span><br>
so<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Yohanu says</span><br>
basically<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Frell Bzigalsmichtz says</span><br>
how to get around?<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Yohanu says</span><br>
every object in game is an index in the array rite<br>
like every part of game engine<br>
the array is just an Object[][]<br>
meaning you can’t tell what type is in what index<br>
and my guess is that<br>
everytime you connect<br>
all indices are scrambled<br>
resulting in something even harder than making a packet bot<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Frell Bzigalsmichtz says</span><br>
thats what WoW did<br>
it pretty much destroyed private servers<br>
Yohanu says<br>
ll<br>
so yeah<br>
this is luls<br>
pretty sure they do reflection checks now too<br>
as a backup<br>
in addition to more gradual updates<br>
looks bright<br>
finally i can actually talk to people in game<br>
instead of talking to walls<br>
(bots)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Frell Bzigalsmichtz says</span><br>
I quoted this convo<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Yohanu says</span><br>
mk<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Frell Bzigalsmichtz says</span><br>
for the faggot mscp 12 year olds who think theyre badass because they can load up a bot and hit start<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Yohanu says</span><br>
ol<br>
[/quote][/quote]<br>
Finally gg to bots? “WE CANT L0ZE HUR WE RUIN DA ARE ES”</p>
<p>First he makes a ownage nigger song, then a song about hitler, NOW THIS?!?!<br>

they've butchered the client
for real
all instance variables are gone
it's all in a massive object array
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
so
youre basically telling me
that
jagex knew what they were doing this time? and bot owners dont know what theyre in for yet?
jacmob etc
Yohanu says
yep
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
are trying to keep their community calm
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
i expected them to go this far
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
by saying "oh ill have it in a few hours"
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
eventually
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
so
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
basically
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
how to get around?
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
every object in game is an index in the array rite
like every part of game engine
the array is just an Object[][]
meaning you can't tell what type is in what index
and my guess is that
everytime you connect
all indices are scrambled
resulting in something even harder than making a packet bot
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
thats what WoW did
it pretty much destroyed private servers
Yohanu says
ll
so yeah
this is luls
pretty sure they do reflection checks now too
as a backup
in addition to more gradual updates
looks bright
finally i can actually talk to people in game
instead of talking to walls
(bots)
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
I quoted this convo
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
mk
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
for the faggot mscp 12 year olds who think theyre badass because they can load up a bot and hit start
[b]Yohanu says[/b]

<p>The owners of powerbot and rsbuddy have yet to see whats in for them, and they’re trying to keep their userbase nice and calm.</p>

              <p>That last quote is inaccurate. Botting does affect everyone else that plays legitimately, its called the economy. People who try to obtain resources legitimately, for example, dragon bones, can’t get the resources half of the time, and when they do, they are plummeting in price. If you aren’t willing to play the game legitimately, why make a program play for you?</p>

<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="pdzQfTYsN70" data-youtube-title="Jagex Runs Runescape, not rsbuddy" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div></p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by idiots like him, much like JaGeX, RSbuddy &amp; RSbot make money off what they develop.  All of the cocky legit players that are bragging and trolling on the RSbuddy forums need to learn what you are talking about before you make videos like this.</p>
<p>Like any company, JaGeX isn’t perfect, there will always be glitches and holes in their game and people to exploit them.  Thinking that botters who make tens of thousands of dollars developing will just say “oh, they ruined the reflection system, we quit” is idiotic.</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from the lead developer of RSbuddy</p>
<p>[quote=“Jacmob”]This week’s update has brought some interesting internal changes to RuneScape. The game now requires a newer version of Java (which almost all of you will have already installed) and has therefore been able to shed some old code to make room for technical and graphical improvements!</p>
<p>Jagex has also mentioned to a few people that this update includes new ‘anti-botting’ technology. As a result over 10,000 of our users have come to our forums all at once to check on the progress in updating RSBuddy! It is true that this update will require some bigger changes than usual in order for bots to be back up and running smoothly. I am going to conduct a more thorough review of the update and I’ll be updating you on my progress by updating this thread.</p>
<p>Please check back in a few minutes for an estimated update time once my update review is complete.</p>
<p>Update: Today’s update leaves a reasonable amount of work required to update the bot, but this will be easily manageable. I also plan to develop new software that will make further updates of this kind easier to manage.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m not saying that the RSbuddy Devs are better than JaGeX, but people need to stop thinking that this is the end of all bots forever, even simple programs such as Mouse Recorder Pro can be used to bot.</p>
<p>Also, regarding the whole “Triple rewards week” thing;<br>
I have no doubt that they are only doing it to make sure that no one thinks the game will die.  Bots probally make up 3/4 of all players, that’s a decently large chunk.</p>
<p>To the people saying “You’re just some mad kid who can’t bot any more lmao”:<br>
I’m not mad, and I already quit botting about 6 months ago, I just think that those who think this is the end of bots need to learn how these things work.</p>
<p>To the people asking “Why not just take down the site(s)?”:<br>
There’s a quote from Jacmob I couldn’t find (forgot where it was), but RSbuddy shares lawyers with movie studios and some major production sets, and are commonly considered some of the best lawyers in the UK.  If JaGeX wanted to go to court with them over a simple In-Game rule violation (not a law), they would be ready.</p>
<p>I know many of you hope bots don’t come back, in a way I wish they would thin out some (yes I admit some over do it by botting on like 5 accounts at once), I’m just defending the community I love.  Many project botters as lazy bastards who are below 12 and are just to lazy to do work.  As it turns out, most are them actually are smarter than 95% of RuneScape players I’ve ever met.  If they don’t enjoy beating their brains out for a month just to go pking for 2 days, then they’ll find a smarter way, and botting just so happened to be a solution.</p>
<p>I’m not projecting legit players as dumb, I respect them, but they’re in no position to judge or insult botters for any reason.</p>
<p>To end this, here’s one last quote I found</p>

<p>Also botters did nothing to hurt the players who played for real. The only reason they complained was because they werent as rich as the bots. It didnt degrade their levels at all, bots have no advantage at all except time. Bots just shorten time. You dont get a limited edition sword for botting…</p>
