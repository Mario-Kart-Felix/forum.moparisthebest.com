    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/presidental-debate/235698</link>
    <description>Here are [b][i][u]SOME[/u][/i][/b] facts about the debate, this may not be up-to-date but still it covers most of the topics.

 Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain stretched the facts in accusing each other of kowtowing to the oil industry and sprinkled other dubious assertions across the landscape of public policy in their first presidential debate. 


 
McCain&#39;s plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent across the board so as to spur job creation was boiled down by Obama into a $4 billion tax break for Big Oil, as if no other companies or workers would benefit.

McCain similarly cut corners with context when he accused Obama of voting for huge subsidies for the oil industry. Obama voted to strip away those subsidies and, when that failed, backed broad energy legislation that contained them.

So it went during 90 minutes of debate, a reality warp at times.

Some examples:

OBAMA: &quot;Sen. McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who is one of his advisers, who along with five recent secretaries of state just said we should meet with Iran — guess what? — without preconditions.&quot;

MCCAIN: &quot;Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve face-to-face meetings between the president of the United States and (Iranian President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad. He did not say that. He said there could be secretary-level and lower-level meetings. I&#39;ve always encouraged that.&quot;

THE FACTS: Obama was right that Kissinger called for meetings without preconditions. McCain was right that Kissinger did not call for such meetings to be between the two presidents.

In a foreign policy forum on Sept. 15, Kissinger said: &quot;I am in favor of negotiating with Iran.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level&quot; and the U.S. should go into the talks with &quot;a clear understanding of what is it we&#39;re trying to prevent. What is it going to do if we can&#39;t achieve what we&#39;re talking about? But I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations. We ought, however, to be very clear about the content of negotiations and work it out with other countries and with our own government.&quot;

___

OBAMA: &quot;John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion&quot; in tax breaks.

THE FACTS: The $4 billion in tax breaks for the oil companies is simply part of McCain&#39;s overall corporate tax reduction plan and does not represent an additional tax benefit. In other words, the corporate tax reduction applies to all corporations, oil companies included. Both Obama and McCain have proposed eliminating oil and gas tax loopholes.

___

MCCAIN: Said the country has lost the sense of accountability exemplified by Allied commander Dwight Eisenhower on the eve of D-Day. He said Eisenhower wrote one letter to be released in the event of victory, which praised the troops, &quot;and he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.&quot;

THE FACTS: Eisenhower prepared to take responsibility in the note to be delivered in the event of D-Day disaster but did not offer to resign.

The full text:

&quot;Our landings in the Cherbourg-Le Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.&quot;

___ 

OBAMA: Said he would make sure that the health care system &quot;allows everyone to have basic coverage.&quot; 

THE FACTS: If that sounds like universal health coverage, it&#39;s not. Obama picked his words carefully — stopping short of claiming outright that his plan provides health care for all. He promises to make health insurance affordable but would only require that children, not adults, have coverage. Estimates of how many would remain without insurance vary. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said during the primaries that Obama&#39;s plan would leave 15 million people uninsured. 

Who will? Who do you think will win?</description>

It took him about 5 years to get a virtually limitless gun licence, which allows him to do things such as host gun club events, make black powder explosives and the like (etc al, you get the idea), make suppressors and silencers for weapons to be sold to police and military personnel, and so on.<br>
5 years is a long time.</p>
<p>If I wanted to own a firearm, I’d have to go through a pretty rigorous police check. First they’d do a background check, followed by interviews. They’d be looking for things like depression in medical history and that stuff too.</p>
<p>Various weapons require various licence types. For example, a handgun requires a higher licence than a rifle. This being the case, storage security would also have to be stepped up.<br>
If I owned a weapon then it would technically be illegal for anyone but myself to know of its location in the house. It’d also have to be stored in a steel safe (if it was a handgun or class H weapon) that meets various specifications.<br>
Rifles, which are class A, B and C, have to be stored in at least a heavy solid wooden box.</p>
<p>In short, licencing for guns would be a pain in the arse. Oh, and you have to hold a firearms licence for a paint ball gun too in Australia.</p>

              <p>Here are <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">SOME</span></span></span> facts about the debate, this may not be up-to-date but still it covers most of the topics.</p>
<p>Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain stretched the facts in accusing each other of kowtowing to the oil industry and sprinkled other dubious assertions across the landscape of public policy in their first presidential debate.</p>
<p>McCain’s plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent across the board so as to spur job creation was boiled down by Obama into a $4 billion tax break for Big Oil, as if no other companies or workers would benefit.</p>
<p>McCain similarly cut corners with context when he accused Obama of voting for huge subsidies for the oil industry. Obama voted to strip away those subsidies and, when that failed, backed broad energy legislation that contained them.</p>
<p>So it went during 90 minutes of debate, a reality warp at times.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>OBAMA: “Sen. McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who is one of his advisers, who along with five recent secretaries of state just said we should meet with Iran — guess what? — without preconditions.”</p>
<p>MCCAIN: “Dr. Kissinger did not say that he would approve face-to-face meetings between the president of the United States and (Iranian President Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad. He did not say that. He said there could be secretary-level and lower-level meetings. I’ve always encouraged that.”</p>
<p>THE FACTS: Obama was right that Kissinger called for meetings without preconditions. McCain was right that Kissinger did not call for such meetings to be between the two presidents.</p>
<p>In a foreign policy forum on Sept. 15, Kissinger said: “I am in favor of negotiating with Iran.” He went on to say, “I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level” and the U.S. should go into the talks with “a clear understanding of what is it we’re trying to prevent. What is it going to do if we can’t achieve what we’re talking about? But I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations. We ought, however, to be very clear about the content of negotiations and work it out with other countries and with our own government.”</p>
<hr>
<p>OBAMA: “John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion” in tax breaks.</p>
<p>THE FACTS: The $4 billion in tax breaks for the oil companies is simply part of McCain’s overall corporate tax reduction plan and does not represent an additional tax benefit. In other words, the corporate tax reduction applies to all corporations, oil companies included. Both Obama and McCain have proposed eliminating oil and gas tax loopholes.</p>
<hr>
<p>MCCAIN: Said the country has lost the sense of accountability exemplified by Allied commander Dwight Eisenhower on the eve of D-Day. He said Eisenhower wrote one letter to be released in the event of victory, which praised the troops, “and he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy.”</p>
<p>THE FACTS: Eisenhower prepared to take responsibility in the note to be delivered in the event of D-Day disaster but did not offer to resign.</p>
<p>The full text:</p>
<p>“Our landings in the Cherbourg-Le Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.”</p>
<hr>
<p>OBAMA: Said he would make sure that the health care system “allows everyone to have basic coverage.”</p>
<p>THE FACTS: If that sounds like universal health coverage, it’s not. Obama picked his words carefully — stopping short of claiming outright that his plan provides health care for all. He promises to make health insurance affordable but would only require that children, not adults, have coverage. Estimates of how many would remain without insurance vary. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said during the primaries that Obama’s plan would leave 15 million people uninsured.</p>
<p>Who will? Who do you think will win?</p>
