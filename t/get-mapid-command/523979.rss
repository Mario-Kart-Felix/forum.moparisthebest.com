    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/get-mapid-command/523979</link>
    <description>Yo.

I&#39;m in need of command, which will help me to locate map, where I builded up custom area. Spent over 2weeks with this map and very proud about what I have done.

But yeah..
I need to get somehow know, where did I built my masterpiece.
Map ID required to use Tom&#39;s cache suite and to relocate it.

Thanks already for your answers.</description>
