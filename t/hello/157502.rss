    <description>This have not so much with coding or anything to do with. but anyway :) i tell you what i was thinkin in school yesterday.

when i had swedish lession we talked about novels. and my teacher starter to learn how to right one.
in a novel u need a: 
*Beginning
*environment (that the peaple in the novel is living in)
*the characters of cource.
*the plot/act/action
*&quot;turning-point.
*and the end.

and than i figure out its almost like coding a server. 

in a novel u need an act/plot part that is very small/short and in a server u need the client java to be as small as possible. and than as more you got of those things around the &quot;act&quot; as better will the story be. and as more handlers (the files around java(lol)) you got as better will the server be without lagg. 

kinda cool ey? =) so to me, its almost to right a novel but in a &quot;diffrent language&quot; lol xD.

well, if this topic is in wrong place plz remove it :)
