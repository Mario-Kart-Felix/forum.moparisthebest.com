    <title>Hello</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello/62427</link>
    <description>I have recently taken much intrest in SCAR bot, A couple nights ago I was botting with WT-Fakawi&#39;s Goblin scheduler. Today I tried to login and I noticed my account was disabled. I went to the page to view offences and its got the Rule 7 blah blah stuff. Now I need advice on getting this account back. When I click &quot;View Evidence&quot; there is nothing there. The ban says its &quot;Applealable&quot; so maybe there is a chance I can get my account back.

Any advice is great.

              <p>Try posting this in the Runescape board.  Lots of people there have suggestions.</p>
<p>Mostly people just say “I will commit suicide.” That used to work but JageX finally figured it out.</p>
