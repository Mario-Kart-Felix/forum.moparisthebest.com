    <title>Client ip changing issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-ip-changing-issues/446666</link>
    <description>I swear I&#39;ve done this a million times and this is the only client i can&#39;t figure it out in....I searched for every possible ip in client.java and even found this and changed it to my desired ip (voldexscape) and it still wont connect to the ip it connects using 127.0.0.1 localhost. there is no GUI.java or any other files besides the classes. there is an EGUI but it doesnt have anything in it (only like 20 lines read the whole thing) and im clueless where to go now.....here is what i found and changed to my ip
BTW i tried not to advertise

EDIT: I&#39;m not sure if it has to do with my compile error, but thats all i can think of....no idea what it means but i only get it with clients:
