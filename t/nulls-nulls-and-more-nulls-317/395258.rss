    <title>Nulls, nulls, and more nulls. [317]</title>

    <description>greetings Moparscape community,
The issue I am having is with an old school source.  I have searched far and wide to no avail. What I seek is an anti null script. I already have a connection flooder preventative implemented in the source. What I want is the null handler that allows nulls to connect, but, insted of keeping them online to show up in my player list, it disconnects them.  Any help appreciated (I&#39;m getting tired of needing to reset the server every 30 mins to prevent lag, lol)
Thanks in advance,
Chris</description>
