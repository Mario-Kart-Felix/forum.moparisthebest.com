    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-562-help-needed/370595</link>
    <description>ok guys im looking for some fast help, im an ametuer working on an atomicscape 562 client. i have it up and running and have a webclient through google.com

here are my questions:

1) when i make myself admin, all the commands dont work anymore, it says &quot;use the reverse apostraphe key (`) to open the console to enter that command. it is usually located under the esc key&quot;. it only does this when you are admin/owner of the server, when you are regular player the player only commands work fine, but when admin/owner none of the commands work, admin or normal ones. Any1 got any advice?

2) how to i make a client to put on my site for my players to download so they dont have to use the desktop?</description>
