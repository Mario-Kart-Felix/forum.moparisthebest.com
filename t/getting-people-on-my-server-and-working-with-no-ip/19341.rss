              <p>Here is one of my old posts on this issue:</p>
<p>Ok I hate repeating this so tell this to everyone who has this error and say its for Mod Taharok. Ok so first of all your saving issues are because of no auto saver. The first thing you should do is look in tuts section for an auto-saver for testscape. Next YOU CANT USE ONLY NO-IP TO RUN A SERVER. If you have a router (almost everyone does), then type in the ip address of the router into your address bar. Then log into the router settings. Click on “Advanced”, then click on the side panel “gameing” (this is if your using a DLink router, but if you have somthing else it should be similar). Ok now you have to make a new rule, the name should be your server name. Next the computer IP should be the ACTUAL COMPUTER IP, NOT THE INTERNET IP FOR THAT COMPUTER, THE REAL THING! Next in the Tcp ports to open is supposed to be “43594”. Then click “save settings”. Ok now go to no-ip and your IP address should be there (internet IP this time, not real IP like the one used to log into router or to make rule). Now it should work successfully. If you dont have a router then you probably have to use Hamachi (peer to peer), and I dont like peer to peer so I have no clue how to use it. I hope this helped. Enjoy!</p>
