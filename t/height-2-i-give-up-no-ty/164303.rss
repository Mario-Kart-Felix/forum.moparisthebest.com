    <title>Height#2. I give up? No ty</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/height-2-i-give-up-no-ty/164303</link>
    <description>Ffs.. I&#39;ve been at this for weeks.. And still nothing... GRR.

Does anyone know the height mask?! For player gfx? Example.

mask100var1 = id; = Id of the graphic
mask100var2 = delay; Time before graphic is created.

Now does anyone know the mask for height? To control the height of mask100var1 ?

Someone said it was an int in the method... He said it wasn&#39;t the id, obviously. The only other int left is delay. He also said it was in the 40k&#39;ish region... 

But isn&#39;t that the delay ?...

[code]
public void playerGfx(int id, int delay) {
mask100var1 = id;
mask100var2 = delay;
mask100update = true;
updateRequired = true;
[/code]

Who ever gives me the correct answer, PM me and you [b]WILL[/b] get a reward... And it will be good.

Many thanks.</description>
