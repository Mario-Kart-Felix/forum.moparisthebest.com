    <title>Changing genders?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-genders/236326</link>
    <description>Ok I&#39;m wondering how do you change you&#39;re gender to a female? So my baby sis can actually have a girl hehe

Just a simple question but I don&#39;t see anything that has to do with changing gender....

Also what&#39;s the correct interface for a client? Someone said a solution to fixing d/c when bringing up a window (shops) is due to interface Also if I do the ::char command so I can change genders It will just d/c me


[b]Was the moparscape forums down? Cause it wouldn&#39;t let me on it until now[/b]

Thanks a lot!!!!
