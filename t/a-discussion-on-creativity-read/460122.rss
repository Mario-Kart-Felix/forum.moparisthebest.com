    <title>A Discussion on Creativity - READ -</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-discussion-on-creativity-read/460122</link>
    <description>I would like to say before starting, that this is not to degrade or undermine the current quality of the content being produced by the R.S.P.S. community as a whole. This is done simply in an attempt to open your eyes and show you the limitless possibilities you have at your fingertips, which can be goals that are set and accomplished by manipulating Game-Play Mechanics, Core Mechanics, and sometimes adding &#39;brand new&#39; content. You don&#39;t even have to add &quot;new Revision&quot; content; things that other people may disagree with to differentiate yourself from others. 



I&#39;m honestly sick and tired of seeing people saying how &quot;Unique&quot; and &quot;Creative&quot; they are compared to everyone else and other Private Servers. A lot of you keep using these words, but I don&#39;t believe you know what they mean.

Let&#39;s take a look at the definition of the word &quot;Creativity&quot;: 

noun

1. The state or quality of being creative.
2. The ability to transcend traditional ideas, rules, patterns, relationships, or the like, and to create meaningful new ideas, forms, methods, interpretations, etc.; originality, progressiveness, or imagination.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ability to transcend traditional ideas&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is without a doubt the most important part of what has been said so far. This can be considered as thinking &#39;outside of the box&#39; or, &#39;outside of the mundane&#39;. I&#39;m now going to show you how easy it can be for someone to take Game-Play Content such as the Thieving Skill from RuneScape, and make it Creative.
 
You can argue that you disagree with how this Skill plays out, but you cannot argue the difference.


A general synopsis of the Skill known as Thieving: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thieving: Thieving is usually the same boring thing, you get the level, and you move on to a new N.P.C. which gives
you a miniscule amount of Coins and or Items. You are now able to Thieve from any N.P.C. at level 1 Thieving, It&#39;s no longer based on level. Instead, you are told the chance of success you have to pickpocket the N.P.C. based on several factors, including 
your Thieiving level, equipment worn (certain pieces of equipment such as Rogue sets increase success rates), and
more. The higher the level the N.P.C. is - the greater the chance of higher loot rewards. 
You must be a certain level to be able to have a chance to pickpocket certain things. For example, you must reach level 70 Thieiving before you have a chance to be able to Thieve Gilded armor. There will be Perks and certain Items and Equipment that are very useful for this Skill. For instance, at level 55, you may obtain Flash Powder via the Thieving Skill Exchange (accessed by speaking with the Skillcape Master of the Skill). This Flash Powder can be bought with Thief Tokens. The purpose of the Flash Powder, is, when you are caught pick-pocketing from a N.P.C. you are stunned for longer than usual, this is to help balance out the Time V.S. Reward factors. Flash Powder can be used to escape the stun completely, and be ready to pick-pocket again as soon as you use the Powder. 
However, you will soon run out of Flash Powder, as they are deleted upon use. Eventually all N.P.C. except for Bosses 
and Mini-Bosses will be able to be pickpocketed. Skillcape Masters will also have the Pickpocket option. When the
player is caught - the Skillcape Masters will retaliate with an attack according to their Skillcape mastery. 
For instance: a player caught pickpocketing the Attack Skillcape Master, he will launch
a boulder at the player, knocking the player back 5 spaces and doing damage. The Firemaking Skillcape Master will
use Firemaking against you. He lights a player where the player is standing when caught, if there is already an
existing fire where the player is standing, another one will not be lit. The lit fire does damage to the player until
it de-spawns to ashes. Rare items will also be able to be stolen. The level required is 95, and the Skill&#39;s Experience
rate is x2 RuneScape&#39;s rate. The chance of receiving a Rare item from Thieiving is equal to the chance of receiving 
a 3rd Age item on RuneScape. You can unlock the Rogue equipment set that increases your chance to thieve successfully 
with each piece unlocked by playing the Rogue Den Minigame.&lt;/blockquote&gt;








In closing, I would like to say this. It is a fantastic idea to draw ideas based on other video games. The M.M.O.R.P.G. industry today pretty much lives off just that.

[size=14pt][b]IF YOU ARE GOING TO ATTRACT SERIOUS DEVELOPERS WITH YOUR &quot;UNIQUE&quot; SERVER DEVELOPMENT THREADS, YOU SHOULD REALLY BRING &quot;UNIQUE&quot; TO THE TABLE. PLEASE DON&#39;T SAY UNIQUE AND CREATIVE AND POST SCREENSHOTS OF YOUR CHARACTER STANDING ON A TILE PERFORMING A SIMPLE TASK.[/b][/size]

I would LOVE for everyone to collaborate with each other and throw out ideas on this thread.</description>
