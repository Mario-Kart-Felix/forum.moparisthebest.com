    <title>Command error?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/command-error/201176</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I was editing my client.java yesterday, and fixed my 2 compiling errors with commands.

The problem is.. when i type the command it doesnt work, but the server console says it is.

The issue is i made a command to spawn g mauls, and when i type the command and the server says it&#39;s ok, it doesn&#39;t show up in my inventory.

I also think this may have something to do with moparscape itself, becuase my source code has a lot of things in it that don&#39;t show up on mopar,
yet when i compile its perfect, no errors.

If anyone could help me with this it would be highly appreciated, also if it has anything to do with it, my server is Cheezscape Pk source.

Thanks,
Void Knight</description>
