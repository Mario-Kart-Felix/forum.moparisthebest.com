    <title>[508] Need Help [508]</title>

    <description>Ok, my current problem is that I am making a new home on a 508 server.  I have made it so when you are a new player when you log in you go to a certain spot.  But, when you do the command ::home you go to a different spot.  I need help with changing the coords of the current ::home to the other spot I have selected.  I also would like to add 1-2 bank stalls at the current spot I have picked out for my home.  I would also like to add Shop NPCs.

If you can help me with these problems please comment.  Thank You.</description>
