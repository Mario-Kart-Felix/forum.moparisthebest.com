    <description>Hey guys, I was wondering how to become owner on my 508 server.
Thing is, i&#39;m admin with p.rights = 2; but in game it shows me up as Admin.

And everyone blabs around asking for the owner? 
Plus theirs extra commands for the owner in the source im using.

So can you guys please help ASAP?</description>

<p>[quote=“Shadow1442, post:2, topic:382141”]There is no Owner right in 508. There is only Upto Admin. but you can go over rights 2, but it will have no crown in public chat<br>
but in PM’s it does. So i suppose it Hidden Admin. Just put your name in yell and players as Title “Main Owner” and Make yourself<br>
Donator, If your source has it.[/quote]</p>
