              <p>Ok, You need to change your ip from a local host (127.0.0.1) this is often referred to as home.<br>
You need to change it in Gui.java (if not then client.java)<br>
Search for 127.0.0.1, Change that to you no-ip (If you donâ€™t have one then get one)<br>
Compile and it should work,<br>
