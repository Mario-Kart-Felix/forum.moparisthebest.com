    <description>Hoo-ie! This takes me back; used to be a lurker when I was but a young tyke, constantly spewing mucus from the pores o&#39; me skin.

Just a bit about myself, before I get started; my coding experience involves the extremely easy language used by Skyrim (Papyrus), and some experience with Pascal, which I learned through using the Tes5Edit program for the game (allows automation of tasks via pascal scripting).

My 3D skills just encompass rather basic manipulation of existing meshes (outfits &amp; body meshes, mainly) in 3DS Max, though I have done a rather rough sculpt of a muscular body mesh in Mudbox, using a thin body mesh as a base. I hope ta gain experience by editing and developing the low-poly models used in RS, and getting familiar with animating through the same method.

*Achem*

Having gained an interest in scripting, 3D modelling, music and faffing about with friends, I&#39;ve been taking a gander at various private server software packages for games.

Originally, I was hoping to have fun with the source code of an Ultima Online PS package, by the name of ServUO, but it only supports an antiquated client...Which was made in the late 90s, and uses [url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms536380%28v=vs.85%29.aspx]GDI+[/url]. It&#39;s, uh, painful on the eyes, to say the least.

I recently remembered that there was a community for Runescape private servers, which piqued my interest. I&#39;ve been doing a bit of digging, but to my dismay, there is quite a bit of dated information floating about, as far as getting a solid client and server is concerned. The best-looking guide that I found, with provided client and server software, is [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,193370.0.html#post_server3]this one[/url], that was updated in 2010.



That&#39;s from half a decade ago, and I have spied that there are a couple threads providing much newer clients hanging around.

I do ask if there is a more solid client &amp; server package I could test the waters of Java and RSPS development with. Considering how there are efforts being made to create an official Moparscape family of servers, this should be a good time to get acquainted with developing a server.

Probably a tad too forward-thinking of me, but I&#39;ve got a general outline of what I am looking for, in terms of server/client software; and what I plan to work towards, in my pursuit of getting acquainted with Java and RS private servers. Opinions on the available software (links would be good, too  ;)) and what I hope to accomplish during my stay &#39;ere, would be most welcome.


[spoiler=List Of Ideal, Baseline Features]
1. Working &quot;Options&quot; panel - I fired up the Moparscape 3.2 package a week or two ago, and noticed that most of the options were not working; toggling between default walking/running made no difference, for example. Having working settings would be rather...necessary.


2. General object interaction - Being able to open/close doors/gates/what-have-you, being able to place something on a table (that was possible in RS2, way back in 2004, if I do remember correctly), dropped items appearing correctly, being able to cook with a stove in an NPC&#39;s house (that was also possible, IIRC), that sort of thing.


3. (Rudimentary) Implementation of skills - I&#39;ve read that there are some issues with certain server packages; not being able to make campfires, fishing animations not displaying, not being able to pickpocket, unable to identify herbs, etc. Having these implemented/fixed would be most beneficial.


4. Allowing for custom midi/sound files - I do like to bugger around with my Yamaha MX61, and am intrigued about having custom music play, particularly in different regions (IIRC, whenever you changed region, such as going from Varrock -&gt; Falador, the music track would change). Also, having custom battle sound effects would be rather fun to play around with.


5. Resizeable client - Back in the day, I do remember downloading from the Runescape website a dedicated .exe for launching Runescape. What was good about this, was that the client stretched to fill the window, if it was maximized. The difference in resolution (even if it was just up-scaled) was much easier on the eyes.


6. Allowing for custom 3D models &amp; animations (weaponry, clothing, monsters, etc.) - Another reason I am wanting to work with a RS PS, is that I have an affinity towards low-poly art, such as that found in Runescape during 2004/2005, the Playstation, Nintendo 64, etc. Being able to create custom art would be pretty damn sweet, as that would aid in sharpening up my skills in 3DS Max 2012.


7. Allowing for custom dialogue - Naturally, I plan on honing my writing by creating dialogue for NPC-NPC and NPC-Player interactions. From idle tavern banter and drunken songs, to a guard commanding a player to give up their weaponry. Being able to do this, would do wonders for immersion.
[/spoiler]


[spoiler=List Of Planned Features/Content, in no particular order]
1. Removal of banks - Much like how Ultima was during it&#39;s first year or so, I plan on having it so that players have to store their items in actual containers (chests, crates, sacks, etc), which can be ransacked by other players/NPCs. This may sound insane, but this will contribute towards the greater picture.


2. Respawn limitations - It is fairly odd that you can chop a tree down, and it pops back after a few seconds have passed. I wish to make it so that, when you chop a tree, it&#39;s dead. However, if a druid/gardener player happens to pass by, they can choose to work some magic, or apply a potion to the stump, to make it grow back.

This methodology of respawning would apply to guards, black knights, white knights, barbarians and the like, by requiring players to go to specific locations (e.g, Falador castle to respawn white knights), typing a command and/or interacting with an object, where the player gives up coinage.

When the contributed money reaches a certain amount, it is removed entirely from the game, and an NPC of the appropriate type spawns, moving to where the NPC used to be stationed.


3. Persistent storage - The game world is filled with crates, dressers, bookcases, sacks, chests, barrels and other such containers. Yet, at least for vanilla Runescape, you can&#39;t place/remove items from them. I wish to make each placed container have it&#39;s own unique inventory (same as the banking interface), which players can make use of. Of course, I&#39;d rather that they don&#39;t respawn by default (so players don&#39;t lose items, nor would they be able to camp them) unless I make that specific container able to.

Probably would have to create new containers on a case-by-case (dungeon-by-dungeon, perhaps?) basis, but hey. If that&#39;s what it takes...


4. Roaming, sandboxing NPCs - This is an issue which has plagued every damn MMO these days; NPCs just stay in one place, whether their comrades are being slaughtered, the city is under attack, or they haven&#39;t slept for five months. This needs to change.

Ideally, I would set conditions, such as how much time has passed since they went to a certain place, how much time since they last ate, how much time has passed since they were attacked/stolen from, etc.

These conditions, when met, would invoke the NPC to enact something. The actions would range from locking their doors, going to bed, drinking at the tavern, sitting down and eating a chocolate cake at their dining table, or hunting down a specific player/NPC.

Such a system would be classified as rather advanced, I&#39;d imagine, so that&#39;s probably only going to be possible to implement if I become adept with Java and programming a Runescape PS.


5. Day &amp; Night. Fairly self explanatory - The server would have it&#39;s own time (one real minute = 20 in-game minutes) and day-night cycle. Depending on the time of day/night, the colours would change (slight red-pink tint for morning, no tint &amp; brighter for noon, orange tinge for evening, darker &amp; slight blue tint for night, etc). Should be fairly easy, if it&#39;s possible to make custom DirectX/OpenGL shaders?


6. Skyboxes - By default, Runescape just has blackness, when you view the edge of the rendered scene/area/whatever. Surely it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to have a low-poly sphere with a blue background and white clouds on it, which surrounds the entire area, allowing it to be viewed where originally there would be black.


7. NPC Factions - This is probably yet another hyper-advanced feature, which would require some serious expertise with Java. What I&#39;d like to have, in the far-off future, is to allow players to join NPC factions, as well as have NPCs be integrated within them as well. For example, the Barbarian Village would have it&#39;s own faction, which players can join. As would the black knights, the white knights, the Rellekkans, etc.

This would be utilized alongside the addition of the (psuedo?) dynamic NPC AI, outlined by #4. For example, the Barbarian Village would lead excursions against Varrock, raiding the houses, doing battle with the guards, and if they&#39;re successful, taking captives and looting the houses and shops.

Another example, would be the black knights raiding the city gates of Falador, with the white knights coming to meet them. Should the white knights win, they would march upon the black knight fortress, exacting vengeance until they&#39;ve taken numerous losses, upon which they would return to Falador, and ask players to contribute coinage towards the white knights (#2).

Or, if the black knights were to win, they would lay waste to the white knights, proceeding to govern Falador (I.E, the black knights would respawn there, instead of the white knights) until players have slain the occupiers and given occupancy back to the white knights (or maybe even another faction, such as the goblins, dwarves, gnomes, barbarians, etc).


8. Rebalancing equipment stats - One of the most irksome features of MMOs, is that they make it so that a new player has as much damage-dealing strength as a mentally deficient cockroach with dysentery, whilst a player that&#39;s been playing for half a year is able to summon meteors and bring hellfire upon the lower levels.

I wish to remedy this, by making the disparity between gear tiers much, much lower. For example, a bronze platebody has a defence of 3 (all damage types). Iron would have 3 (4 against one-handed weapons). Steel 3 (4 against two-handed weapons). Mithril 3 (4 against one-handed, two-handed &amp; ranged). Adamantite 4 (all damage types). Rune 4 (5 against magic). Dragon 4 (5 against magic &amp; ranged)

This, I would imagine, wouldn&#39;t require advanced coding skills, but would be tedious as all hell, due to the sheer number of equipment pieces &amp; types.

This would also require NPCs to be rebalanced - Again, just extremely tedious, no?


9. A limit to the amount of coins a player can have in the inventory (1,000 coins?) - I wish to make it so that players will be fairly impoverished, for most (if not all) of their character&#39;s lifetime - This is to spur interaction, discourage hoarding and to keep coinage important. 5 Coins will buy you a loaf of bread. 10 Will buy you a night at the inn. 15 Will buy you bronze gauntlets. 50 Will buy a bronze platebody. 100 Will respawn an NPC. Etc.


10. NPC Companions - I&#39;d also like to make it so that you can have certain NPCs aid a player in their travels, by following you and providing combat assistance. Supposing you&#39;re in the same faction, have the right amount of coins and/or have done a task for them, you can have the NPC follow you, where they will provide assistance against hostile enemies, supposing they are in an opposing faction.

That would prevent situations, such as having white knight followers attack the city guards, or lay waste to the farms dotting the countryside.
[/spoiler]


Now, about the server software itself, I do remember reading about there being a divide between object-oriented environments, and not obect-oriented environments.

How object-oriented is the typical software package? As in, say there is a generic guard in Lumbridge, one of many. Does it have it&#39;s own properties (who he&#39;s following, what faction he&#39;s in, disposition towards certain players/NPCs, the current AI being utilized, etc.), or is there a base-object/record/whatever-term-is-used-here, which would have to be re-created for every NPC to have it&#39;s own parameters?

For the Ultima Online private servers, for example, there is a base NPC. For example, a troll. This troll will be re-used a thousand times over, with many of them spawned throughout the world.

However, each spawned troll can have it&#39;s own characteristics, supposing the appropriate flags/variables are applied to the troll when it&#39;s spawned - one troll may follow one player, but attack another. One troll may have an AI package that tells it to run around every tree it comes across, whereas another troll may attack other trolls.

And when that troll died, chances are, the respawned troll would have different characteristics from it&#39;s previous spawn.

Is that sort of thing possible here, or would that require an extensive rewrite of rather low-level game code &amp; systems?



Whew. That&#39;s about all I can think of to ask (and what I can be assed to type) right now. Lookin&#39; forward to the responses.</description>

<p>Pretty much this. Firstly, majority of the public works for RSPS are terribly written and hacked together. Either you write something better, or avoid the whole mess that is RSPS and write something original and not RS related.</p>
<p>Writing something original gives you more room to implement unique ideas and provides a better learning experience.</p>

<p>I’ve done my share of sharing new ideas. It quite irratates me when people say “nobody releases new things” but when somebody does such a thing, nobody notices.</p>
<p>Alot of the work in the pastebin in my signature are ideas I have released to the public, snippets, tutorials, and even downloads.</p>

<p>Took a look at Apollo; the plugin system looks very swanky, but the scripts have no documentation.</p>
<p>In the main Apollo thread, the only posts made, past 2012, were people posting bumps. Only one lad contributed a plugin, which was the mining plugin with a few variables changed to point to hatchets, trees and the woodcutting skill.</p>
<p>Some documentation explaining what the variables point to, which flag does what, etc. would go a long way. But aye, Apollo seems swanky, though it looks more like a framework than an actual server package.</p>

<p>Care to clarify what you mean by this? As in, do you mean that the common opinions on implementing the fundamental systems over-emphasize how difficult it is?</p>
<p>It’s just…Agh. I’ll just get burnt out and frustrated if I attempt to learn Java by doing the nitty-gritty framework-type stuff, seeing as how I’ve never programmed with Java before.</p>
<p>Having a solid foundation to work from would be best, y’know? Anything released that comes close to that, or are people keeping the workable packages private?</p>
<p>If that’s the case…Eurgh. Would explain all the lads saying the community is dying, if nobody shares their work.</p>

<p>Ugh. Having to remake a bunch of low level game systems, networking logic, etc. from scratch…I can just manage to handle Pascal; to do such stuff with a language I know zilch of, and not spend ten years on making a character play an emote…</p>
<p>There are an abundance of servers, it does seem. Surely one of the more mature and refined ones must have a release to modify, no? Kinda a shame if the private server development has been around for 8+ years, with nobody sharing their works.</p>

              <p>Hoo-ie! This takes me back; used to be a lurker when I was but a young tyke, constantly spewing mucus from the pores o’ me skin.</p>
<p>Just a bit about myself, before I get started; my coding experience involves the extremely easy language used by Skyrim (Papyrus), and some experience with Pascal, which I learned through using the Tes5Edit program for the game (allows automation of tasks via pascal scripting).</p>
<p>My 3D skills just encompass rather basic manipulation of existing meshes (outfits &amp; body meshes, mainly) in 3DS Max, though I have done a rather rough sculpt of a muscular body mesh in Mudbox, using a thin body mesh as a base. I hope ta gain experience by editing and developing the low-poly models used in RS, and getting familiar with animating through the same method.</p>
<p><em>Achem</em></p>
<p>Having gained an interest in scripting, 3D modelling, music and faffing about with friends, I’ve been taking a gander at various private server software packages for games.</p>
<p>Originally, I was hoping to have fun with the source code of an Ultima Online PS package, by the name of ServUO, but it only supports an antiquated client…Which was made in the late 90s, and uses <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms536380%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">GDI+</a>. It’s, uh, painful on the eyes, to say the least.</p>
<p>I recently remembered that there was a community for Runescape private servers, which piqued my interest. I’ve been doing a bit of digging, but to my dismay, there is quite a bit of dated information floating about, as far as getting a solid client and server is concerned. The best-looking guide that I found, with provided client and server software, is <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,193370.0.html#post_server3" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this one</a>, that was updated in 2010.</p>
<p>That’s from half a decade ago, and I have spied that there are a couple threads providing much newer clients hanging around.</p>
<p>I do ask if there is a more solid client &amp; server package I could test the waters of Java and RSPS development with. Considering how there are efforts being made to create an official Moparscape family of servers, this should be a good time to get acquainted with developing a server.</p>
<p>Probably a tad too forward-thinking of me, but I’ve got a general outline of what I am looking for, in terms of server/client software; and what I plan to work towards, in my pursuit of getting acquainted with Java and RS private servers. Opinions on the available software (links would be good, too  ;)) and what I hope to accomplish during my stay 'ere, would be most welcome.</p>
<p>[spoiler=List Of Ideal, Baseline Features]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Working “Options” panel - I fired up the Moparscape 3.2 package a week or two ago, and noticed that most of the options were not working; toggling between default walking/running made no difference, for example. Having working settings would be rather…necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General object interaction - Being able to open/close doors/gates/what-have-you, being able to place something on a table (that was possible in RS2, way back in 2004, if I do remember correctly), dropped items appearing correctly, being able to cook with a stove in an NPC’s house (that was also possible, IIRC), that sort of thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Rudimentary) Implementation of skills - I’ve read that there are some issues with certain server packages; not being able to make campfires, fishing animations not displaying, not being able to pickpocket, unable to identify herbs, etc. Having these implemented/fixed would be most beneficial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing for custom midi/sound files - I do like to bugger around with my Yamaha MX61, and am intrigued about having custom music play, particularly in different regions (IIRC, whenever you changed region, such as going from Varrock -&gt; Falador, the music track would change). Also, having custom battle sound effects would be rather fun to play around with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resizeable client - Back in the day, I do remember downloading from the Runescape website a dedicated .exe for launching Runescape. What was good about this, was that the client stretched to fill the window, if it was maximized. The difference in resolution (even if it was just up-scaled) was much easier on the eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing for custom 3D models &amp; animations (weaponry, clothing, monsters, etc.) - Another reason I am wanting to work with a RS PS, is that I have an affinity towards low-poly art, such as that found in Runescape during 2004/2005, the Playstation, Nintendo 64, etc. Being able to create custom art would be pretty damn sweet, as that would aid in sharpening up my skills in 3DS Max 2012.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allowing for custom dialogue - Naturally, I plan on honing my writing by creating dialogue for NPC-NPC and NPC-Player interactions. From idle tavern banter and drunken songs, to a guard commanding a player to give up their weaponry. Being able to do this, would do wonders for immersion.<br>
[/spoiler]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[spoiler=List Of Planned Features/Content, in no particular order]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Removal of banks - Much like how Ultima was during it’s first year or so, I plan on having it so that players have to store their items in actual containers (chests, crates, sacks, etc), which can be ransacked by other players/NPCs. This may sound insane, but this will contribute towards the greater picture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respawn limitations - It is fairly odd that you can chop a tree down, and it pops back after a few seconds have passed. I wish to make it so that, when you chop a tree, it’s dead. However, if a druid/gardener player happens to pass by, they can choose to work some magic, or apply a potion to the stump, to make it grow back.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This methodology of respawning would apply to guards, black knights, white knights, barbarians and the like, by requiring players to go to specific locations (e.g, Falador castle to respawn white knights), typing a command and/or interacting with an object, where the player gives up coinage.</p>
<p>When the contributed money reaches a certain amount, it is removed entirely from the game, and an NPC of the appropriate type spawns, moving to where the NPC used to be stationed.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Persistent storage - The game world is filled with crates, dressers, bookcases, sacks, chests, barrels and other such containers. Yet, at least for vanilla Runescape, you can’t place/remove items from them. I wish to make each placed container have it’s own unique inventory (same as the banking interface), which players can make use of. Of course, I’d rather that they don’t respawn by default (so players don’t lose items, nor would they be able to camp them) unless I make that specific container able to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably would have to create new containers on a case-by-case (dungeon-by-dungeon, perhaps?) basis, but hey. If that’s what it takes…</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Roaming, sandboxing NPCs - This is an issue which has plagued every damn MMO these days; NPCs just stay in one place, whether their comrades are being slaughtered, the city is under attack, or they haven’t slept for five months. This needs to change.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, I would set conditions, such as how much time has passed since they went to a certain place, how much time since they last ate, how much time has passed since they were attacked/stolen from, etc.</p>
<p>These conditions, when met, would invoke the NPC to enact something. The actions would range from locking their doors, going to bed, drinking at the tavern, sitting down and eating a chocolate cake at their dining table, or hunting down a specific player/NPC.</p>
<p>Such a system would be classified as rather advanced, I’d imagine, so that’s probably only going to be possible to implement if I become adept with Java and programming a Runescape PS.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Day &amp; Night. Fairly self explanatory - The server would have it’s own time (one real minute = 20 in-game minutes) and day-night cycle. Depending on the time of day/night, the colours would change (slight red-pink tint for morning, no tint &amp; brighter for noon, orange tinge for evening, darker &amp; slight blue tint for night, etc). Should be fairly easy, if it’s possible to make custom DirectX/OpenGL shaders?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skyboxes - By default, Runescape just has blackness, when you view the edge of the rendered scene/area/whatever. Surely it shouldn’t be too difficult to have a low-poly sphere with a blue background and white clouds on it, which surrounds the entire area, allowing it to be viewed where originally there would be black.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NPC Factions - This is probably yet another hyper-advanced feature, which would require some serious expertise with Java. What I’d like to have, in the far-off future, is to allow players to join NPC factions, as well as have NPCs be integrated within them as well. For example, the Barbarian Village would have it’s own faction, which players can join. As would the black knights, the white knights, the Rellekkans, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This would be utilized alongside the addition of the (psuedo?) dynamic NPC AI, outlined by <span class="hashtag">#4</span>. For example, the Barbarian Village would lead excursions against Varrock, raiding the houses, doing battle with the guards, and if they’re successful, taking captives and looting the houses and shops.</p>
<p>Another example, would be the black knights raiding the city gates of Falador, with the white knights coming to meet them. Should the white knights win, they would march upon the black knight fortress, exacting vengeance until they’ve taken numerous losses, upon which they would return to Falador, and ask players to contribute coinage towards the white knights (<span class="hashtag">#2</span>).</p>
<p>Or, if the black knights were to win, they would lay waste to the white knights, proceeding to govern Falador (I.E, the black knights would respawn there, instead of the white knights) until players have slain the occupiers and given occupancy back to the white knights (or maybe even another faction, such as the goblins, dwarves, gnomes, barbarians, etc).</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Rebalancing equipment stats - One of the most irksome features of MMOs, is that they make it so that a new player has as much damage-dealing strength as a mentally deficient cockroach with dysentery, whilst a player that’s been playing for half a year is able to summon meteors and bring hellfire upon the lower levels.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wish to remedy this, by making the disparity between gear tiers much, much lower. For example, a bronze platebody has a defence of 3 (all damage types). Iron would have 3 (4 against one-handed weapons). Steel 3 (4 against two-handed weapons). Mithril 3 (4 against one-handed, two-handed &amp; ranged). Adamantite 4 (all damage types). Rune 4 (5 against magic). Dragon 4 (5 against magic &amp; ranged)</p>
<p>This, I would imagine, wouldn’t require advanced coding skills, but would be tedious as all hell, due to the sheer number of equipment pieces &amp; types.</p>
<p>This would also require NPCs to be rebalanced - Again, just extremely tedious, no?</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>A limit to the amount of coins a player can have in the inventory (1,000 coins?) - I wish to make it so that players will be fairly impoverished, for most (if not all) of their character’s lifetime - This is to spur interaction, discourage hoarding and to keep coinage important. 5 Coins will buy you a loaf of bread. 10 Will buy you a night at the inn. 15 Will buy you bronze gauntlets. 50 Will buy a bronze platebody. 100 Will respawn an NPC. Etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NPC Companions - I’d also like to make it so that you can have certain NPCs aid a player in their travels, by following you and providing combat assistance. Supposing you’re in the same faction, have the right amount of coins and/or have done a task for them, you can have the NPC follow you, where they will provide assistance against hostile enemies, supposing they are in an opposing faction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That would prevent situations, such as having white knight followers attack the city guards, or lay waste to the farms dotting the countryside.<br>
[/spoiler]</p>
<p>Now, about the server software itself, I do remember reading about there being a divide between object-oriented environments, and not obect-oriented environments.</p>
<p>How object-oriented is the typical software package? As in, say there is a generic guard in Lumbridge, one of many. Does it have it’s own properties (who he’s following, what faction he’s in, disposition towards certain players/NPCs, the current AI being utilized, etc.), or is there a base-object/record/whatever-term-is-used-here, which would have to be re-created for every NPC to have it’s own parameters?</p>
<p>For the Ultima Online private servers, for example, there is a base NPC. For example, a troll. This troll will be re-used a thousand times over, with many of them spawned throughout the world.</p>
<p>However, each spawned troll can have it’s own characteristics, supposing the appropriate flags/variables are applied to the troll when it’s spawned - one troll may follow one player, but attack another. One troll may have an AI package that tells it to run around every tree it comes across, whereas another troll may attack other trolls.</p>
<p>And when that troll died, chances are, the respawned troll would have different characteristics from it’s previous spawn.</p>
<p>Is that sort of thing possible here, or would that require an extensive rewrite of rather low-level game code &amp; systems?</p>
<p>Whew. That’s about all I can think of to ask (and what I can be assed to type) right now. Lookin’ forward to the responses.</p>
