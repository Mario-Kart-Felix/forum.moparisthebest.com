    <description>Hello Ladies and Gentlemen!

A little about myself:
Hello im james. Ive been creating rs-ps server for years and I am currently looking to start a new long term project. Im 23 years old and live in England. I like riding my kawasaki 636 motorcycle, working out and also playing games like fallout 4, star wars battle front and other ps3/4/pc games. 

Why am I creating a server?
Basically I hate corruption and paying to win games. My aim is to create a totally free server that people can play and have fun, where know one is above anyone else and everyone is working towards the improvement of the server and the community. 

How the server will be funded?
I have a full time job and I have already purchased a vps, I have purchased an american vps 80gb hd 2 gb ram 1000gb port connection. The server only cost a small amount.

What am I looking for?
Im looking for 2 kind non corrupt people. Helpful kind considerate people who care about the community and the game. No Pervious experient is required but is alway helpful. Please if you are interest and speak &quot;type&quot; english well please pm me with your skype. 

Thanks again ps sorry for this rushed thread i have no time to proof read.

Night night james.</description>
