    <title>[WikiLeaks] Afghan War Diary, 2004-2010</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wikileaks-afghan-war-diary-2004-2010/351207</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;25th July 2010 5:00 PM EST WikiLeaks has released a document set called the Afghan War Diary, an extraordinary compendium of over 91,000 reports covering the war in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2010.
The reports, while written by soldiers and intelligence officers, and mainly describing lethal military actions involving the United States military, also include intelligence information, reports of meetings with political figures, and related detail.
The document collection is available on a dedicated webpage.
The reports cover most units from the US Army with the exception of most US Special Forces&#39; activities. The reports do not generally cover top secret operations or European and other ISAF Forces operations.
We have delayed the release of some 15,000 reports from the total archive as part of a harm minimization process demanded by our source. After further review, these reports will be released, with occasional redactions, and eventually in full, as the security situation in Afghanistan permits.
The data is provided in HTML (web), CSV (comma-separated value) and SQL (database) formats, and also was rendered into KML (Keyhole Markup Language) mapping data that can be used with Google Earth. Please note that the checksums will change.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No, its a proven fact that the terrorists in 9/11 werent linked to the middle east. George W Bush obviously saw it as an opportunity to go over and cease control of the oil in the area while covering with the war and ‘rebuilding’ the middle east. If you werent so fucking brainwashed you would have realized this by now. The whole war is a joke and is impossible to win.</p>

<p>(Delayed Report) At 0530Z ISAF reported an incident between LNs and members of Dynacorp in Kabul. ISAF reported 3X Nepalese members of a private security firm were trying to buy sheep in a local market when a fight broke out between the security team and the LNs. 1X LN was killed and 1X Dynacorps member was also killed. 2X Dynacorps members were wounded and received treatment at KAIA. The other two Nepalese left the scene in a taxi and were seen entering the US Embassy.[/quote]</p>
<p>Mercs were buying sheep? LOL.</p>
<p>I’m literally fascinated by this shit. NEED TO JOIN ARMY.</p>

<p>Mercenaries != us average military. Mercenaries can do almost anything they want because the cooperations have enough money to pay the media to not mention deaths etc. They’re only in it for the money.[/quote]</p>

<p>If it is true there is not much we can do about it now. Im sure in 100 years from now there is going to be so much more known about what happened in the past years. It really doesn’t matter anymore Bush can’t be elected, he has served his two terms. He sent the troops in for 30 days but Congress voted to keep it going and a majority of the democrats or those who consider themself liberal in the senate voted to start the war.</p>

They intentionally keep their public schools bad so children will grow up not being able to be sceptical and will be vulnerable to people poisioning their minds.</p>

<p>Also this is how it goes on the otherside<br>
(of course, not all people with left-wing views are bad. A few of them have legitamate converns and arguments worthy of consideration)</p>

WikiLeaks is biased end of. I wouldn’t be surprised if they took anything that we did good out and left all the bad shit. Also nobody really gives a shit its not like its going to change anything, if the US thought they were a threat they would just shut them down quietly.</p>
<p>EDIT: Then I read this rofl</p>
<p>[quote]We have delayed the release of some 15,000 reports from the total archive as part of a harm minimization process demanded by our source.[/quote] sure…<br>
[/quote]<br>
I can say 2 things about that.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Biased doesn’t mean they are wrong, just look at Penn &amp; Teller, you know how its going in the first minute, but they are not lying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course they focus on the wrong about the war, this leaks i to show how bad the war have gone.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I suggest you go back to Fox News if you don’t like the truth.</p>
<p>EDIT: The server <span class="bbcode-s">/IP is in Sweden</span> is in Iceland, so USA could not just shut it down.[/quote]</p>
<p>You don’t live in America but you act like you know whats going on here. The sad fact is you have never watched any American news station but would love baseless comments.<br>
Also if it really was A HUGE THREAT although only 1% of the population in America know not that wikileaks exists, let alone care that they only use there funding to uncover shit that will make America look bad.</p>
<p>Just like the the last video they released which turned out to be bullshit, I will love to see where this goes.</p>
<p>Oh yeah and @ yakman about 90% of the teachers in my public high school are very far leftwing liberals. My AP Gov class last semester had a teacher so far left it was hard to just let her sit there talk all of the bullshit, anybody who would actually argue the facts with here were sent to ISS for disrupting class. I think there may be a wide gap between the liberals in my country and the liberals in yours.</p>

<p>Because they’re completely wrong when it comes to the war. Wikileaks just likes smearing bullshit over the internet to attain profits from all the wannabe anti-American hippie lib fags.</p>

<p>Hmm, thats why text books have 2-3 pages about Hillary Clinton and a small half page paragraph about Reagen. Get them hooked on bullshit when they’re young so when they start to hear the truth they deny it.[/quote]</p>
