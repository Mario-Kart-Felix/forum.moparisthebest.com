    <description>May someone please help me increase my model index to add custom items?
According to I Vain I: LoadError 60 is unpacking models. If you&#39;re preloading models, make sure to increase the model index.
If this is the problem someone please help me.
I&#39;m currently trying to add the donor cape models. I have changed the ints, but it is still not working.
When I compile it everything is fine, but then I get this:

Someone please help ASAP.
I already tried increasing the [#####] from [80000] to [90000], and even to [500000], but I am still getting &quot;Error loaderror Exion 60&quot;
