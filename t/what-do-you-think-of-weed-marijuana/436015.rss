Personally I would love it to be legal to smoke it :)</description>

Thats a lie, even if it were true which its not… the skins etc needed to smoke that much would either kill you or you’d pass out. Remember smoking gives off small values of carbon monoxide the more u smoke the more thats in you. You get it from ANY time of smoke.[/quote]<br>
With that logic, you can die from burning candles.  And iirc, you have to consume 1/3 of your body weight in marijuana in 15 minutes to die.</p>

<p>Oh well I wouldn’t know.</p>
<p>If it was government controlled there would still be illegal imports of it due to the high amount of taxation that would come with it. If it was limited to public and private companies you’d be getting some shitty stuff that gets you barely high for not long from places like Walmart then a number of expensive small businesses selling good expensive shit. Either way illegal imports would continue (or atleast non regulated). It would benefit a number of states with fertile land and long fields (Cali, etc) and potentially be the next tobacco.</p>
