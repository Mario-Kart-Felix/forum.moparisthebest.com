    <title>Allow Website Links in RS2 Server/Client Showoff Board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/allow-website-links-in-rs2-server-client-showoff-board/539860</link>
    <description>First of all, let me verify I am not suggesting to remove link approval by moderators. I am all for it and support it 100%.

My argument is basically that links should be allowed to be posted on project threads within this board after being verified by a moderator. It makes no sense how links are allowed to be posted after approval in the Development Teams board. If anything, links to the project&#39;s community (website) should be allowed in this board over the Development Teams board. This board is not only for showing off work, but its the only place where you can post your project thread. Project threads help for building anticipation for your followers/supporters. Allowing the project owners to post the link only helps the project more as it directs traffic to the community. 

Please allow links to be posted on project threads after they&#39;re verified by a moderator. It makes absolutely no sense the way it is set up right now.</description>

First-time game devs build a community and have a website, etc., promoting their upcoming product before it’s released too. Ok.</p>

<p>No it wouldn’t be advertising. People should be allowed to follow updates and what no on the forums and be apart of the community there. It’s not like they’re advertising I guess, but anyone who would like to follow the development more can register on the forums and what not. They can post suggestions and feedback. I don’t understand why it isn’t aloud.</p>

              <p>The rules were different, for some reason when the sections got merged we got the old rules instead of the updated ones. I can’t remember exactly what the new rules were but there was something about linking to your own advertisement threads in your development threads and being able to post website links in development threads as long as the server was not already being hosted.</p>

Wouldn’t that allow advertising in that section? Just my opinion …<br>
[/quote]<br>
No it wouldn’t be advertising. People should be allowed to follow updates and what no on the forums and be apart of the community there. It’s not like they’re advertising I guess, but anyone who would like to follow the development more can register on the forums and what not. They can post suggestions and feedback. I don’t understand why it isn’t aloud.</p>

              <p>First of all, let me verify I am not suggesting to remove link approval by moderators. I am all for it and support it 100%.</p>
<p>My argument is basically that links should be allowed to be posted on project threads within this board after being verified by a moderator. It makes no sense how links are allowed to be posted after approval in the Development Teams board. If anything, links to the project’s community (website) should be allowed in this board over the Development Teams board. This board is not only for showing off work, but its the only place where you can post your project thread. Project threads help for building anticipation for your followers/supporters. Allowing the project owners to post the link only helps the project more as it directs traffic to the community.</p>
<p>Please allow links to be posted on project threads after they’re verified by a moderator. It makes absolutely no sense the way it is set up right now.</p>
