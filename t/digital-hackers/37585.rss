    <description>Okey just to let you know ive copied lots from the book &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; just so i dont get flamed to death but its not exactly the same xD


Digital Hackers

”Ring…Ring…” 
That was the sound that started Susie Fletchers nightmare. She picked up the phone and said: “Susie Fletchers, how may I help you?” “Come to the NSA as quickly as possible.” Then the man hung up. Well you might wonder what NSA is. Less than 3% of Americans knows what it is and the few who does like to call it “No Such Agency” because it is so secret. The real meaning of NSA is National Security Agency. Susie Fletcher quickly drove to the NSA wondering what could be so important that she had to come on a Sunday morning. When she arrived, she saw the massive blue box who almost reminded her of a popcorn box. Even though she had seen it over a million times it always impressed her as much as the first day she saw it. Inside this building were some of the most powerful and strongest computers ever build worth over 3 billion $. It was a master piece.
Susie walked up the stairs to the NSA front door and gave the security guard her ID card. He quickly scanned it trough the computer and said: “Welcome Susie, what brings you here today?” She wondered the same. When she finally was inside the NSA building she walked right to her boss’s office and said: What is so important that I need to be here on a Sunday morning?” “I’m Sorry” The boss apologized. Then he explained. “Susie, we are under attack.” Susie felt a stream of anger running through her. “What? You made me come over just because of that? We handle computers worth over 3 billion $ don’t tell me you can’t handle a little attack without calling me for help!” “Susie this is not a normal attack. Somebody hacked the Pentagon last night.” The boss said almost shaking. “Why don’t you guys just trace the IP and arrest the guy?” asked Susie. The boss was just going to say something when he got interrupted by the phone. When he was done talking Susie asked: “Who was that?”
 “It was the… President… Her boss said. That they couldn’t trace the IP because it did come from some public guy” “Are you telling me some punk hacked the Pentagon?” She fired back. “Susie I wouldn’t call this guy a punk” Said her boss. Meanwhile some place far away Richard Molt sat with classified information that could start a new world war. Susie was already running towards her computer. She quickly scanned all the latest changes in info going in and out of the pentagon and going in. She found nothing “How could this guy hide all the tracks” She though out loud. Then something caught her eye. 

You have 39 new Mail’s

Her blood froze. She quickly noticed that all the mail’s was sent on almost the same time except one. She opened one of them, but she couldn’t understand what it said.

Yzoo nv (244)-907-350

Dv szev z orgoov kilyovn

She figured out it must be some kind of a code. But she couldn’t break it. So she tried the next mail.

R wrw rg r tlg gsv rmul blf dzmgvw

Yzoo nv mld

She was even more confused. Then it suddenly did strike her maybe the letters did stand for the next one in the alphabet. She tried it out.


Zapp mw (355)-018-461

Ew tafw a pshppw ljmvpwm

That made no sense. Maybe it was the letter before not the next. She tried that to.

Xynn mu (133)-896-249

Cu rcyu y nqnnu jhkxnum

She was even more confused. This time she was going to try the opposite letter.

Call me (977)-214-861

We got a little problem

She traced the number to a guy named Richard Molt. She was just going to send a SWAT team to the location when she noticed she had almost forgot about the other mail.

I got the info you wanted

Then she knew what to do. 30 minutes later she was standing outside a small house in North Washington with a bunch of SWAT cars. Suddenly she heard a shot. “Take your positions!!” The SWAT commander yelled. They quickly stormed the house but only to find the dead body of Richard Molt and the computer screen reading.

Thank you Richard. Finally I no longer have to worry about you. In 1-3 hours the SWAT will be here and you will be arrested and charged for hacking the cyber net.



The End

Thanks for reading</description>

              <p>Okey just to let you know ive copied lots from the book “Digital Fortress” just so i dont get flamed to death but its not exactly the same xD</p>
<p>Digital Hackers</p>
<p>”Ring…Ring…”<br>
That was the sound that started Susie Fletchers nightmare. She picked up the phone and said: “Susie Fletchers, how may I help you?” “Come to the NSA as quickly as possible.” Then the man hung up. Well you might wonder what NSA is. Less than 3% of Americans knows what it is and the few who does like to call it “No Such Agency” because it is so secret. The real meaning of NSA is National Security Agency. Susie Fletcher quickly drove to the NSA wondering what could be so important that she had to come on a Sunday morning. When she arrived, she saw the massive blue box who almost reminded her of a popcorn box. Even though she had seen it over a million times it always impressed her as much as the first day she saw it. Inside this building were some of the most powerful and strongest computers ever build worth over 3 billion $. It was a master piece.<br>
Susie walked up the stairs to the NSA front door and gave the security guard her ID card. He quickly scanned it trough the computer and said: “Welcome Susie, what brings you here today?” She wondered the same. When she finally was inside the NSA building she walked right to her boss’s office and said: What is so important that I need to be here on a Sunday morning?” “I’m Sorry” The boss apologized. Then he explained. “Susie, we are under attack.” Susie felt a stream of anger running through her. “What? You made me come over just because of that? We handle computers worth over 3 billion $ don’t tell me you can’t handle a little attack without calling me for help!” “Susie this is not a normal attack. Somebody hacked the Pentagon last night.” The boss said almost shaking. “Why don’t you guys just trace the IP and arrest the guy?” asked Susie. The boss was just going to say something when he got interrupted by the phone. When he was done talking Susie asked: “Who was that?”<br>
“It was the… President… Her boss said. That they couldn’t trace the IP because it did come from some public guy” “Are you telling me some punk hacked the Pentagon?” She fired back. “Susie I wouldn’t call this guy a punk” Said her boss. Meanwhile some place far away Richard Molt sat with classified information that could start a new world war. Susie was already running towards her computer. She quickly scanned all the latest changes in info going in and out of the pentagon and going in. She found nothing “How could this guy hide all the tracks” She though out loud. Then something caught her eye.</p>
<p>You have 39 new Mail’s</p>
<p>Her blood froze. She quickly noticed that all the mail’s was sent on almost the same time except one. She opened one of them, but she couldn’t understand what it said.</p>
<p>Yzoo nv (244)-907-350</p>
<p>Dv szev z orgoov kilyovn</p>
<p>She figured out it must be some kind of a code. But she couldn’t break it. So she tried the next mail.</p>
<p>R wrw rg r tlg gsv rmul blf dzmgvw</p>
<p>Yzoo nv mld</p>
<p>She was even more confused. Then it suddenly did strike her maybe the letters did stand for the next one in the alphabet. She tried it out.</p>
<p>Zapp mw (355)-018-461</p>
<p>Ew tafw a pshppw ljmvpwm</p>
<p>That made no sense. Maybe it was the letter before not the next. She tried that to.</p>
<p>Xynn mu (133)-896-249</p>
<p>Cu rcyu y nqnnu jhkxnum</p>
<p>She was even more confused. This time she was going to try the opposite letter.</p>
<p>Call me (977)-214-861</p>
<p>We got a little problem</p>
<p>She traced the number to a guy named Richard Molt. She was just going to send a SWAT team to the location when she noticed she had almost forgot about the other mail.</p>
<p>I got the info you wanted</p>
<p>Then she knew what to do. 30 minutes later she was standing outside a small house in North Washington with a bunch of SWAT cars. Suddenly she heard a shot. “Take your positions!!” The SWAT commander yelled. They quickly stormed the house but only to find the dead body of Richard Molt and the computer screen reading.</p>
<p>Thank you Richard. Finally I no longer have to worry about you. In 1-3 hours the SWAT will be here and you will be arrested and charged for hacking the cyber net.</p>
<p>The End</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>
