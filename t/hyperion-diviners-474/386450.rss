Note:
The server isn&#39;t online, I&#39;m just putting this here sort-of as a project for now, but not really a project because I&#39;m not putting a feature list or anything. The server will be up in about 3 days.

Why is there always flaming on MoparScape? It’s absurd and utterly stupid, respect some people’s projects, don’t jump into arguments, and most of all, don’t start them. Seriously, it’s just stupid how much flame goes on around here, those nice guys on MoparScape just stand by-and-by waiting for a non-flame topic here on MoparScape. Just stupid on the amount of flame that goes on around here, I think it’s because MoparScape has all the <span class="bbcode-b">best</span> coders on here so they think they’re better then everyone, or better then this and that, nobody is just <span class="bbcode-i">the best</span>. That’s why Rune-Serber has so little flame [compared to Mopar], it’s because over half of them really aren’t that great at coding, as well as RuneLotus. But seriously, it just infuriates me to see how much flame happens here, can’t we just be a user-friendly community instead of bashing on other’s work constantly? Is that really too much to ask?<br>

Thomas bought flaresoft off Scu11, and all it had was combat and a few minigames.

Yes, I do know how to <span class="bbcode-b">program</span>. I’m not your bro, you’re obviously a goofy little kid calling me your bro, and clearly you did read it let’s not lie, don’t put tl;dr, and Thomas doesn’t know how to program for shit, he buys sources and releases them either with an RAT or in attempt to get reputation, and he did nothing to it you’re obviously on his dick saying he wrote all of it, and where do you see a korasi sword? You’re an immature kid that needs to grow up and see the real world, instead of insulting peoples moms over an internet forum about an online game, over credits or w.e.</p>

You’re a fucking faggot, this is what moparscape is. Don’t fucking talk shit when you haven’t seen the source firstly, secondly this isn’t at ALL COUE’s code, not one bit. I stated where the credits went, and that’s that, COUE is 13 or 14 now he’s a big boy, let him keep up with his lies but don’t involve him with a source you know nothing about. I didn’t release this, so don’t assume what base I used and who’s code this is, I know personally the amount of work I put into this, and I don’t have to hear some 12 year old friend of COUE tell me that my project is a leech, go download a dspk then come talk to me.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, Scu11 and Vastico did everything, whatever coue did to flaresoft is his business, I’m not going to use some shit-code source that has 1 more feature than Rs2Server especially programmed by coue, you actually pissed me off by saying Scu11 didn’t do anything, go look at the rs2server project thread.</p>
