    <description>Why is it that the servers on the server status page will be registered and they arn&#39;t up, i swear, out of about 200, 20 of them work and about 15 of them are laggy and now point, and the other 5 are stupid, im just asking that it be&#39;s upgraded since if tried a bunch of servers(about 30) and none work, and also i will log into a server and play for a lil bit, and then get disconnected. I&#39;ll exit out of the server status page and open a new one and look for the name and it appears to be up but when i try to log in it says &quot;error connecting to server&quot; ill have the right I.P.and Port but it doesnt work.

Just throwing this question out to people who have the same problem  :([br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 16, 2008, 04:14:01 PM[/size][hr]alos,i dont know if this is the right section, so sorry if it is, ill move it if it is in the wrong one</description>
