    <title>Buy x</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buy-x/261121</link>
    <description>how would i make it so that when you buy runes or food or just about anything there is a 4th choice called buy x

This will allow you to choose how many of the item you wish to buy.

NOTE: i am using a deltascape based source</description>
