    <description>[center][b][u][size=18pt]Just2006[/size][/u][/b][/center]

[center][size=8pt][b]To start of with you will probably be thinking, Why are you any different from the other 100&#39;s of people working on a 2006 Remake? Well here is your answer. Our developers are coding in the cloud, which means all our developers can be working on the same piece of code at one time, allowing us to work a lot faster. They are also updating their progress and completed tasks in a cloud document which only the developers can access. We are aiming to have a Major testing phase by early 2013 and a playable release with no resets by mid 2013. We will be hosting the worlds in a cloud, meaning that each world will be hosted on different servers on our network and world servers can easily be upgraded! 

Extra details:
The exp rate is 1x! No higher!
Cut off date is may the 15th!
Staff will be professional and must be 15 or over!
More details to come....
