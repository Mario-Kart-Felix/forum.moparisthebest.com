    <title>How can i fix IPban exploit</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-can-i-fix-ipban-exploit/123530</link>
    <description>Allright, well occassionally i get those people on my server who mass,use glitches and use hack clients. i warn them or ban them next step is IP ban. But after i IP ban them they make another account and get back on my server by clicking the &quot;LOGIN&quot; button rapidly and it lets them back in. My point is does anyone have a fix for this? is there a fix for it at all? All they do is click login a bunch of times and they get right in.

Btw: dont start flaming me saying &quot;omg u just told everyone how to get around IP bans&quot; because so many ppl are doing it and if we find a fix it wont even be a problem.

<p>umm u can calm down… it does work. ask anyone else with a brain, and ive tried it myself numerous times. If u even gave it a try u would shut up and know that you are wrong, all u do is create a new account and click login about 15 times and it just lets you in… Now get off my thread u immature child. Your not helping</p>
