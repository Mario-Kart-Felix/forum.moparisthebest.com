    <description>Hey, Ive got a 562 Server and the Base is Rs2Hd. There are a few Glitches/Problems and things I want on my Server. If I ask for something and you have found a thread to tell me how to do that, Please post the Link. Anyway this is what im Stuck on:

 - When you trade it doesnt show what you will Give and Recieve on the second screen.
 - When you drop Items they Disappear
 - Is there any way how to make it so I dont even need to run the source? So the server is already Activated all of the time.
 - How would I add Ancient Curses?
 - How would I add a Fun Pk?

Thanks a Lot! I will Rep++ for an Answer for even one Question that works!</description>
