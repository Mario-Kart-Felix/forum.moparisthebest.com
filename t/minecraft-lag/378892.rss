    <title>Minecraft Lag</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minecraft-lag/378892</link>
    <description>So I recently figured out how to get it running again but there is a problem. Normally minecraft runs
fine on Short/Tiny render distance but now it&#39;s very laggy. I have the latest JDK/JRE, I am virus free and everything
on my computer is up to date.

Any reason why it laggs, or do any of you know a way to fix this?</description>

A lot of times it (the lag) is because of the graphics capabilities of the machine you’re using. When I play on my desktop I get absolutely no lag with the render distance on far. When I join the same server with my laptop, I will lag like hell sometimes even with full fog and every application closed. This is because my laptop has a shitty Intel graphics card.</p>
<p>You’re right in that Minecraft also has some serious issues in the way it was written, that’s no secret. The game is in Beta.</p>
<p>But you can’t blame one thing, it’s a combination of multiple things.</p>

<p>I assure you I am not wrong. I have a friend running the server right now, there is about 5 of us online running on a vps and it lags. Not because of his vps, just because it uses so much memory causing it to run at 100% CPU. The same friend is currently working on writing his own server from scratch, he has started and has the basics on it, with the same 5 people plus more he is running 7% Cpu with the server. My point. The server is poorly written.</p>

<p>I hope you realize Minecraft wasn’t aiming to become multiplayer but since it did, it was a rushed job pretty much. Of course it’ll be shitty. Why do you think we have to rely on 3rd party sources to keep things safe. (Hey0 and bukkit)</p>

<p>I’m not throwing him down on his work, obviously he did something right if he has this many people massively addicted to his game. I’m just saying, it’s the server that causes lag.</p>
<p>And Yes, David. It is. It’s not the people’s connection or the person’s hosting the server’s connection. It is simply the server. Believe what you want to believe. But we have tested it on the server I play. The people lagging really bad will leave the server, and go onto my friends server he is writing from scratch and they will have no lag at all. The one was running 190 FPS.[/quote]Did you ever possibly think it’s because the maps are different, and they take different amounts of memory depending on how many faces the OpenGL needs to show? It’s not the server.</p>

<p>I assure you I am not wrong. I have a friend running the server right now, there is about 5 of us online running on a vps and it lags. Not because of his vps, just because it uses so much memory causing it to run at 100% CPU. The same friend is currently working on writing his own server from scratch, he has started and has the basics on it, with the same 5 people plus more he is running 7% Cpu with the server. My point. The server is poorly written.</p>

<p>I’m not throwing him down on his work, obviously he did something right if he has this many people massively addicted to his game. I’m just saying, it’s the server that causes lag.</p>
<p>And Yes, David. It is. It’s not the people’s connection or the person’s hosting the server’s connection. It is simply the server. Believe what you want to believe. But we have tested it on the server I play. The people lagging really bad will leave the server, and go onto my friends server he is writing from scratch and they will have no lag at all. The one was running 190 FPS.</p>
