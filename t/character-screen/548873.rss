Problem 1) 

The character is completely missing.
I have no idea what causes this.

Problem 2)

That&#39;s what happens when you hover over the area, but that can be fixed by removing the texts, which i&#39;d rather not do.


If anyone has any idea what the cause of this is, it would be much appreciated if you could help me.

You could either skype me, or just leave me a comment.

&#39;Waddafoock&#39; is my skype.

Thanks.</description>
