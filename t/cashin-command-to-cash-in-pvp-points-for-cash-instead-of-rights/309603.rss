    <title>CashIn command (to cash in PVP points for cash instead of rights)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cashin-command-to-cash-in-pvp-points-for-cash-instead-of-rights/309603</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using Delta(317), I believe, and I want to know if there&#39;s a way that you can cash in pvp points for plain cash, like each point is 500k or something. You can already use them to get rights to weild like D-Claws and GS n st00f... but in case they already had it, y&#39;no?


So, it would be like:

Has 30 pts...*Types ::cashin* gets 15m. Now has 0 pts.

OR... Has 30 pts... *Types ::cashin 6* gets 3m, now has 24 pts.

If you understand what i&#39;m saying, could you help, please? :D</description>
