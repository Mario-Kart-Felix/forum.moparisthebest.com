    <title>CPU problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cpu-problem/543811</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having problems with my CPU, it keeps dropping to 0% usage and all my applications freeze. It seems to be spiking quiet a lot. It usually runs at around 20% and maybe 10% idle. 

Does anybody know what might be the problem for it dropping to 0% randomly? 


Edit: This happens when I try run a program as administrator, the security box will appear saying do I want to run this blah blah, when I press yes, the screen will stay dim and I cannot do anything (because CPU dropped to 0%). I have to press ctrl+alt+del to restore it all, and the application will not load. This can be for anything that requires admin privileges such as installing a program. 

I&#39;m using Windows 7.</description>

Try disable UAC, probably avoiding the problem but it would certainly bypass the stupid ‘Allow access’ popups (one of the first things I do with a new Windows installation).  If that requires admin privilege to disable it, then try it through safe mode.</p>
<p>After you’ve disabled it you should be able to do all the above.<br>

Well nothing shows up from a virus scan. I have firewall and other security usually off. I cannot start my anti virus anymore because I need admin rights (fail). I already have my settings for clean boot.</p>
<p>I couldn’t follow any of the steps in the article because even the System File Checker tool you need admin rights lol</p>
<p>Thanks for trying though.</p>
<p>Edit: This is a windows problem because Linux works perfectly fine. Thankfully it’s not a hardware problem.</p>
<p>Edit: I think it’s a problem with my HDD (windows partition) strangely a hell of a lot of it is corrupt and bad!</p>
