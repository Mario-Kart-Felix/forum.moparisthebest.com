    <title>Hyperion by Graham (Crackers) - Stability/Playability</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-by-graham-crackers-stability-playability/509436</link>
    <description>I have 2 questions, one I think might not go here but I didnt see a client help section(sorry if there is, I couldn&#39;t find it :(

ok so, 1.) Hyperion(Graham&#39;s framework) is it stable? Because I read somewhere that there are some Stability/patches for it so I want to make sure its cool before I start with it.

&amp;

2.) Can I just use the moparscape client with it or should I look for Graham&#39;s Client(if there is one I didn&#39;t see it)?</description>
