    <title>Zantrix 728 RsPs- Need Team Apply Here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/zantrix-728-rsps-need-team-apply-here/459034</link>
    <description>Zantrix rsps is a new rsps that i am currently coding
We are 728 revision and it is an spawn server, but all skills must be earned, combat and non combat!
Certain items are not spawnable which makes it also a semi-eco server because some items can only be gotten as a npc drop and sold to other players!
i will be posting pics soon to come when i take some! But we need 2 admin spots and 3 mod spots

mod application:
Age:
How much staff experience do you have:
how active are you:
how often can you advertise and help the server:

admin application:
Must have prior admin+ experience!
Age: (noone under 13 please)
Activeness per day:
What can you bring to the server to help it grow:

We will be releasing within this week, stay tuned for pics and vids to come to get  a sneak peak!

Also a forums maker if u can do forums good and have it hold html we you can message me and we can talk and u can be web developer!

thanks guys =)</description>
