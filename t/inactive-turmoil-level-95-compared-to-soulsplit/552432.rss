<p>Turmoil now introduces the new modes “Ironman and Hardcore Ironman.” To choose one mode, you must make a new account:</p>

<p>A word of caution: <span class="bbcode-b">these modes are in BETA!</span></p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/jCBDc/64eac865bf.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Ironman and Hardcore ironmans will receive overhead icons for distinction, as well as a crown.</p>

<p>Our home shops will not be visible for Ironman and Hardcore Ironman modes.</p>

<p>As an Ironman…</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]You will be unable to trade player-to-player<br>
[</em>]You will be unable to pick up items from the floor dropped by other players and those dropped by monsters killed by other players.<br>
[<em>]Taking part in Player versus Player activities will not award you XP nor loot.<br>
[</em>]Duel Arena is limited. Staking is disabled.<br>
[<em>]The Castle Wars game is limited. PvP XP is not earned.<br>

[<em>]Fist of Guthix is completely disabled.<br>
[</em>]TzHaar Fight Pit is limited. PvP xp is not earned.[/ul]</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>Considering this is a BETA mode, I would love for all Ironmans to make suggestions on the forums for features/limitations for Ironmans!</p>
<p>I have one in mind: removing the damage from thieving stalls.<br>
^ this is being worked on.</p>

There’s some very unique content in here that I’ve never seen anywhere else, the style, just the way it’s all setup. It’s VERY nice, and a really enjoyable RSPS.<br>
I don’t even remember the last time I ENJOYED a server lol. Keep up the good work, and I LOVE the updates that have been coming. It’d be nice to see more names around.</p>

              <p>This is by far probably the best RSPS, better than Runique, and Elveron. Not to mention me being the creater of FoHammer, if any of you know what that is, my project has stopped, we never even released due to my partner quitting, and fucking me over. But I’m probably going to become a developer here, and their going to be TONS of new features, and content everyone will enjoy, along with new items and skill add-ons. I advise everyone to check this server out, it’s VERY well put together, and the owners, and development team have seriously put alot of dedication and time to try and produce a excellent quality, and game-play that no-one has yet to experience in a RSPS. This project is going to go far, and is a long-term project. Please come on in, and try it out! You won’t regret it.</p>
