    <description>Well I saw this on the vbulletin site earlier today in the 3.x section and it got me sort of interested in the idea. 

What it would be like you know how there are &quot;thanks&quot; and &quot;like&quot; buttons on a lot of forums? Well this is similar but it takes a step further. Instead this is a &quot;helped/unhelpful&quot; type of choice. If the topic gets so many unhelpful responses the topic would be automatically locked. 

A person could appeal this lock if they deemed it helpful and people were just being idiots.</description>
