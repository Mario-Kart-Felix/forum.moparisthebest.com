    <description>Ok i recently added quite a few items to my server. new whips, d pl8, claws, vesta and so on. I know how to add the spec with gfx and i have, but for some reason the spec bar will not show up on my client. I might have missed something so just tell me where to add it. Once again specs are already coded i just need the bar to use them.</description>
