    <title>Hardest Sport In The World</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hardest-sport-in-the-world/98156</link>
    <description>Well, what do you think the hardest sport in the world is?

I personally reckon MotoGP, or Motocross.
Don&#39;t say that&#39;s because you sit on a bike and turn the throttle. That&#39;s fine, you must have never rode a track.
100kmh through a set of whoops 3 metres high. Get&#39;s hard to have to do it 30 minutes against 40 other riders, twice a day.

MotoGP is madness. They have to take X-Rays to the airports.. They have so much metal in them from surgery and stuff. 300kmh is bullshit. I&#39;ve been to one. Honeslty, down this 4km straight, they do it in like 7 seconds.</description>

Motocross is not “100x more dangerous” - Both sports can end your life.<br>

You’d be surprised how hard it is.<br>
Nop, want to know why they don’t do interviews? The sport is looked down upon because of injurees, danger, etc.</p>

              <p>[quote=“exe626, post:99, topic:98156”]Oh wow, thats a first, “Foot ball is pussy compared to Motocross” - I literally laughed in real life. “Oh yea, I’m sittin down on my fancy little bike racing around our little track, oh woohoo”, if thats your idea of hard, please, try playing against 11 men weighing 210-300lbs+ that could crush you. - “Oh noes! Thats not hard! Thats pussy shit! 11, 300lb men?! Hah, I can bench more than that!” - Your so pathetic its sickening.<br>
If your gonna sit there and tell me Riding your little bike is harder than running a 100yd. field for 3 hours, your need to think again. Even if your just on the line(Yes, the most forgot-about person on the team), your still working unbelievably hard. Your pushing against a wall, trying your hardest to keep your balance and keep them from getting through. - “Thats your idea of hard?? I can run them over with my bike!” - I continue to fail and see where riding a bike is harder than football.<br>
Go around a corner at what, 100, 120mph? Yes, <span class="bbcode-i">Dangerous</span>. The hardest thing is leaning into the turn right.[/quote]<br>
Tell me were I said I can bench more then 300lb? Tell me where I said football isn’t hard. I know it is hard, I play it.<br>
3 hours?..<br>
“Go around a corner at what, 100, 120mph? Yes, Dangerous. The hardest thing is leaning into the turn right.”<br>
Sorry, but your eyes would be watering at that speed. Leaning into the corner right is the hardest thing?<br>
I’d say holding onto the thing would be.</p>
<p>And why are you flipping it. It’s a discussion, no need to get all aggravated over it.</p>
<p>You’re a typical football junky. You’re all tough and brag about how you bench the weight.<br>
When’s the last time you’ve seen a motocross rider be on the news for sexual assualt? I seem to see a lot of Football players  on T.V for that…<br>
You never see any converage of any racing. Which I think is bullshit. People need to recognise what these champions do to do what they do. You will never witness the intensity of racing, because you’ll be too busy benching more then 300lbs.</p>
<p>“Oh yea, I’m sittin down on my fancy little bike racing around our little track, oh woohoo”, - Uh, lol?</p>
<p>And for the last time. I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT RIDING A BIKE. I AM TAlKING ABOUT RACING A BIKE. - There is HUGE difference.<br>
The time and effort spent on bikes alone by a motocross racer is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Motocross is 100x more dangerous then football, 100x more harder.</p>
<p>Now let me guess, I’m pathetic?<br>
Maybe to you.</p>

              <p>First, I said Football.<br>
Second, it means I play football.<br>
Third, 9-10 are in minor. That’s easy.<br>
Fourth, I don’t think I’m bad at Motocross. I have a few titles to show that <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>At my age, Motocross isn’t fun. My age is were everyone want’s to get sponsored, the kids are getting sooo fit it’s not funny. The sport has changed from old days when you could sit on the line with a beer, these days, a motocross racer wouldn’t look at a beer. I mean, 3 more years, and I could be professional.<br>
I find football easy compared to Motocross. I train for Motocross and ace football, yet still feel tired 25 minutes into the moto.</p>
<p>It just annoys me so much when I mention it, people think I’m one of those people who hit ramps for a living and think I’m “hardcore”. Maybe I think Motocross is the hardest sport. It wouldn’t be far from it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Football is how shall I say it, “pussy” compared to Motocross. What’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to me in football? Put in hospital for 3 days with a concussion.<br>
Worst thing in Motocross? Nearly ended up in a chair for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I don’t like the attitude that goes towards my great sport. Noone who races is a pussy. But that is what makes our sport so good.<br>
As in football, you can bludge, and hang at the back etc, Motocross, you can’t. Otherwise you crash, get passed, come last.</p>

You’ve never raced have you? Any old average joe can ride a dirtbike around a paddock. To do it on a track with 40 other riders for 30 minutes, is alot harder <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>

              <p>[quote=“Chimaera God, post:78, topic:98156”]Honestly, the hardest sport I’ve played is football, high school football. I’m sure anybody who doesn’t play footbsll thinks it’s just a bunch of guys running into each other; well I have news for all of you people, it isn’t. Sure the people running and catching the football have easy tasks and all, but the offensive lineman, defensive lineman, and the quarterback have some hards things to do. One point, you have to have a lot of physical endurance to play football. Getting knocked on your ass by another guy hurts, it hurts a lot. the lineman have to take precisely angled steps once the football is in play in order to do their jobs, AND they have to have enormous amounts of strength to block or try to get past the lineman in front of them. I should know. I plsy right guard and defensive tackle for my team. Our coaches have weight training every day plus endurance running until the coach passes out from exhaustion.</p>
<p>Rugby is EASY, I kill everone at that sport. Motocross just require that you are good enough to flip a motorcycle, which alot of people can do. Wrestling is a very easy sport. The list goes on and on. In my opinion, the sport that is the hardest compared to football is snowboarding/skiing becuae it takes years to perfect. I’ve been snowboarding for close to 4 years now, and the only trick i can do is a Stalefish.</p>
<p>Anybody have a response???[/quote]<br>
Flip a motorcycle?<br>
ROFL!</p>
<p>Who flips a motorcycle in motocross? Apart from Travis Pastrana.<br>
But honestly, who?<br>
I think you’re thinking of Freestyle Motocross.<br>
The sport where everyone’s a champion.</p>
