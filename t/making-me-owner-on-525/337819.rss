              <p>Go into the players file, which would be located in the Data file, then you’d open the notepad inwhich has the account’s name that you’d like to make Owner, and look for player rights. 1 = Mod, 2 = Admin, 3 = Owner, P.S. Owner has no crown, so I’d use Admin. Administrators can still do everything an Owner can, yet still have a crown. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Good luck.</p>
