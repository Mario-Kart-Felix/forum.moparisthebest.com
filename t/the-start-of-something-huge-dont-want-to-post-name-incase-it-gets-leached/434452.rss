    <description>alright. My names Alex, i&#39;ve been wanting to make a rsps since 08 but havn&#39;t had the team... i&#39;ve programmed alot myself, but after about 2 weeks i&#39;ve given up. I think with a team of 2 - 3 people we can make a success from day 1... i&#39;m looking for people that are in the same position as me. I&#39;m 15 years old and i need one or two partners that are familiar with the basics of html/php ... coding the basics... such as.. adding items/objects/shops/npcs (if you are more experienced such as adding quests etc... then PLEASE, i welcome you with open arms :D) ... Alright ... just leave me your skype and i will have a talk with you (via chat or video call, whichever you perfer) and i will see if you meet the standards of joining me :)
- NieX

Server is PI 317.
final project = webclient at: Www.(server-name-here).Org
forums = Www.(server-name-here).org/Smf
:) i can help with this ... it just helps me if you&#39;re familiar with the stuff..

P.S: Must be very fluent in english. I do NOT mind if you&#39;re from Europe or wherever, as long as you&#39;re strong in english. we&#39;re all good ;D

P.S.S: I&#39;m from UK ... so relative timezones will be a advantage.</description>

Html is for the webclient. I do NOT want to be in a position of doing all the website related work myself. Plus with a partner we can share views and see which is best for future standards.</p>

              <p>alright. My names Alex, i’ve been wanting to make a rsps since 08 but havn’t had the team… i’ve programmed alot myself, but after about 2 weeks i’ve given up. I think with a team of 2 - 3 people we can make a success from day 1… i’m looking for people that are in the same position as me. I’m 15 years old and i need one or two partners that are familiar with the basics of html/php … coding the basics… such as… adding items/objects/shops/npcs (if you are more experienced such as adding quests etc… then PLEASE, i welcome you with open arms :D) … Alright … just leave me your skype and i will have a talk with you (via chat or video call, whichever you perfer) and i will see if you meet the standards of joining me <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
