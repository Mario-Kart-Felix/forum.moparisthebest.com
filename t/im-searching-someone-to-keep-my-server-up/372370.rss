    <title>Im searching someone to keep my server up</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-searching-someone-to-keep-my-server-up/372370</link>
    <description>Hey everyone.

[b]I have worked on my rsps server about half week. I have everything done in server and client. Portforward account done, and server has been in serverstatus. Its called Pkz-Scape. Nice shops at home and it has shops in modzone,donatorzone and staffzone. Couple nice things in zones. Example: In Modzone you can buy gilded stuff etc. It has 474 weapon stance and specs 100% working. It has special things, like godwars bosses spot with escape portal and talk to gnome at home to get to &quot;Crazy b*tch&quot; npc and click santa for joke ^^ Pretty nice stuff in server. Good donator-shop too. Forums are ready. I have pictures uploaded to imageshack so u dont need to do screenshot thing.[/b]

But here&#39;s the problem :/
-I cant keep it up 24/7, because my parents are shutting the router down for a night and they didnt listen me when i told I&#39;m losing real money.

[b]If someone kind guy/girl can keep it up, he will get all cash from donations and u will be co-owner :p. Will some1 help me?[/b]

Thanks for reading this :)
