[IMG]http://i60.tinypic.com/34qljih.png[/img]Sponsor
You&#39;re able to buy a sponsor member group allowing you to have rights to certain boards on the forums, also a custom yell tag and rank in-game.
A sponsor rank will allow us to be able to buy advertisements increasing Xeri&#39;s member count; also other products to improve Xeri&#39;s performance
The payment will be discussed through private message on Xeri&#39;s forums or Rune-Server&#39;s forums.

Xeri&#39;s Information
We&#39;re using the up to date version of IPB (invisionpower)


Pvm
New combat system implemented, better melee vs melee defence system as well as better switching instead of qued actions now instant. (still being worked on)

Dupes
Some dupes have been fixed.

Pvp
Xeri&#39;s base pvp system is being reworked, when you kill a player you can obtain 1 pk point, allowing you to spend points in the pk shop.

- How to earn pk points
I think it&#39;s quite self explanatory; in the wilderness once you kill a member you will receive 1 pk point, followed by a message informing you if you received a pk point; if you kill the same person continuously you will not be rewarded. 

Skilling
Our skilling system is almost perfect; a few skills to add so members can obtain experience in the skills; a good experience rate so leveling isn&#39;t to slow nor to fast.

Voting
We&#39;re currently implemeneting a vote system; for now it will be manual voting

Double experience
We have a double experience system; that can be activated and deactivated; allowing all skills to be double experience.

Double donator points
For the first week of Xeri being online; all of the donator points purchased will be x2, for the first 3 months of Xeri being online.

Donator shop
We have a nice donator shop with a good price to them, still adding items and changing the item definitions in updates, you get what you pay for; making the armour what you can donate for worth the donation.

We&#39;re recoding the current donator zone to make it a more improved feature for donators to have.

 (for the first 3 months of the server; the donator who&#39;s donated the most in that month will receive a user group and a yell tag in-game)
They will also receive a item from the list provided on the forums as a reward.

The quest tab has a list of character features; still in development.

Partyhats have been removed from the shop; they can be obtained via events.
Dice bags will be removed after a few have been bought, as I&#39;m not fond on gambling, they will be fairly cheap.

Primal armour is quite expensive; to make it have a high value as it&#39;s powerful.
