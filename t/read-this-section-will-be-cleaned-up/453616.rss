    <description>This is a forewarning that this section will undergo a massive clean over the next few weeks/whenever we get around to it. All topics not considered a tutorial will be moved to the snippets board. All tutorials considered outstanding and worthy of commendation will be moved to the featured tutorials board. The rest will remain here. The rules are hereafter considered tentative until such changes are complete. This means they can and should be expected to change over the next indeterminate time period. Please be sure to stay up to date with them.

If you have any questions, feel free to message me, another staff member, or post a reply in this topic. If you have any suggestions or concerns about the site in general, post them in the suggestions board a few categories down on the board index.

Thanks!</description>

              <p>I’d just like to say please DO NOT report topics that need to be moved en-masse like this. Some other moderators may disagree, but I think that the reports should be used for more urgent things, and seeing a lot of reports may discourage us from looking at all of them</p>
