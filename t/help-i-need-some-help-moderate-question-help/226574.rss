    <description>[b]Please read the whole thing... and if you know how to do this, please tell me...[/b]

Okay, I want to create a new points system for my minigame, and I was thinking if I could create something like pk points or &quot;hasstarter = 1&quot; or something like that in my moreinfo folder...
how would I go by doing this, would I just simply add
&quot;minigamepoints = 0&quot; in my more info file then add a code for everytime you complete a stage in the minigame it adds points, or do I have to edit stuff in my client.java?

don&#39;t flame saying I&#39;m a stupid noob please...


ps. yes I have checked the tutorial sections for this... very many times</description>
