    <title>Why cant i use any clients!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-cant-i-use-any-clients/273078</link>
    <description>i download them because the servers say they wont work right without it, and they dont. Mad i download the .rar/.zip (depends on the server) and i extract everything.
but for the .zip(s) all they have is a thing called &quot;run&quot; and when i click on it the command prompt that windows has pops up and closes in .03 seconds
for the .rar(s) they have a whole list of things and folders but along with the &quot;run&quot; thing there is a &quot;run program&quot; thing also. the same thing happens for the &quot;run&quot; but for the &quot;run program&quot; the command prompt pops up but it stays up and it has some text telling me to go to a website that has nothing to do with the program.

i have the latest version of java and everything so i dont know what it could be</description>
