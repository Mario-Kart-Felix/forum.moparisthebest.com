    <description>Hi there,

For several months I have been gathering resources, various ideas and funds in order to create something rather new in Emulation. Not only RuneScape servers but many, many more. Syngery-Gaming will feature many different servers available to the public for play. From games like RuneScape itself, Minecraft, CS, World of Warcraft and even League of Legends.

As for the Ideology behind the server itself, this will remain [u]confidential[/u] until we have met and are both on agreement terms.

Being a developer on this team (Depending on what you have to offer) will be a paid job. The salary will depend on the work quality of the work done, expertise and of course time consumed.

Our team is consisted of several departments, depending on the hosted game. We have a friendly, active environment with people always willing to assist.

However, note that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you are not willing to dedicate some of your time and efforts in to this, this is [u]not[/u] the place for you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For more information or if you are interested, please contact me through Skype:
