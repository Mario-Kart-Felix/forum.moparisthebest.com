    <title>Port Forwarding help. Won&#39; work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-forwarding-help-won-work/528302</link>
    <description>Trying to port forward from my home pc but it will not work at all. I have tried like 5 different ports and it doesn&#39;t work. I know I am doing it right because I left my computer at my girlfriends house so my server can stay on and it works perfectly fine. But now I wanna port forward another computer thats at my house instead of there so I can actually have my server files with me at all times. And for some reason port forwarding will not work here! I have TeamViewer if anyone wants to help. Please and Thank you.
