    <title>God Wars!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/god-wars/353720</link>
    <description>Ok...So I just added God Wars by the nooby way...(copy and paste)...and I teleported to God Wars and I went in the entrance and it let me in...So I was wondering how do I make the entrace require a certain amount of kills.

              <p>Well I don’t really want to explain all of it, but you know when you open a character .txt file, it says playerrights, and stuff like that? You need to make the server add one and call it something like gwKills (god war kills), and make it so every time a player kills one of the npc’s there, it adds by one. You make gwKills an int and equal it to zero, lets say you want 50 kills, each time a player kills an npc there (you need the npc id), you make gwKills add by one, when a player clicks on the object (the godwars entrance) make it like… if (gwKills &lt; 50) make it say a message (sM) you cannot enter, then add an else and make it teleport to wherever the object is supposed to teleport to.</p>
<p>Complicated, but I don’t really wanna re-read and shorten it. Good luck…</p>
