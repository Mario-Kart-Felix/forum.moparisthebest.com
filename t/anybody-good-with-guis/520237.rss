    <title>Anybody good with guis?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anybody-good-with-guis/520237</link>
    <description>Hey im making a control panel, and i started from almost scratch... Lol, i have been learning slowly about how guis work, but ive come across a problem, whenever i press a button like &quot;ban, mute, kill, pm&quot; etc.. It gives runserver.bat errors, i have 2 things that work though, the &quot;kick&quot; command buton and the global message sending button. The problem i think is that it doesnt read like &quot;c.&quot; before the int to make it work properly.

If anybody here can help me with my control panel, pm me or post here or add my skype : skype name : keithewewew35</description>
