    <title>Minor Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/minor-questions/162395</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t normally talk about myself. But I have some questions about WebHosting, etc. And they involve me spending some of my time, cash, patience, etc. And I need to know before I get in to deep if it&#39;s the right thing to be doing. 

Let me just start by saying that I&#39;ve been doing Web Design, and I&#39;ve been a Web Master for a couple years now, and I really have put off getting into this area because I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the right way to go. And I&#39;ve thought about it, and I would really like to go this route. Besides the fact I&#39;ll have a &#39;partner in crime&#39;. But uh, I was wondering about Web Servers, OS&#39;s and Gaming Servers. 

I am looking too buy two Rack Mount Servers, each with 2 GB of RAM, and a 250 GB Hard Drive. They use an AMD 64 Processor, and I need to know if they can host 2 Counter-Strike Servers, a WoW Private Server, 9 web sites, and probably individual forms for each.

<p>I have BellSouth Extreme DSL, I can’t check the abilities it has right now. But I figured I’d just let you all know. Just in case I do have to switch service providers.</p>

<p>That is what I’m going to need to continue to run the site. I’m going to run a site off of a Web Hosting provider, (Probably NationVoice, unless someone here knows a better deal). Which then I will advertise with Google Adsense. Host a clan site, (with around 40 or so members), as well as a Computer Gaming Appreciation site. So I can get a good user base, and earn the cash to buy this equipment. I am looking to not have to pay out of my own pocket for the venture, which is why I need to know what other areas I can make profit from besides ads. I’ve worked out a donation system, and a membership fee as well. So I am hoping to make from $170.00 to anywhere in the range of $220.00</p>

<p>I have Extreme BellSouth DSL so it’s not that much of a problem, and if it is, I can relocate the servers, or change my Service Provider.
