    <description>There has been a Problem in the Players...
When they click on the Quest tab to choose they&#39;re Style &quot;Master&quot; or &quot;pure&quot;, doesn&#39;t matter which.
The server logs them out (obviously), then when they try to log back in, they&#39;re passwords have been changed..it&#39;s a problem with the source i don&#39;t know how to fix.
but according to this everything seems to be fine.

&lt;blockquote&gt;    /**
     * Player&#39;s username.
     */
    public String username = &quot;null&quot;;

    /**
     * Player&#39;s password.
     */
    public String password = &quot;&quot;;
    /**
     * Player&#39;s rights.
     */
    public int rights = 0;
    /**&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And yes i&#39;ve tried replacing the blank space in &quot; &quot; to Null.

Please tell me what i need to do to fix this problem, thanks.</description>
