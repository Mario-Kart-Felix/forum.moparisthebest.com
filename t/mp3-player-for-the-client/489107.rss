    <title>Mp3 player for the client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mp3-player-for-the-client/489107</link>
    <description>hi,

i was wondering if it was possible to add a mp3 player to a delta client so
you could make a music folder and add a couple of songs there to build up a pretty decent music system
with all kinds of genres. 
it&#39;d be nice if you could help me out with some codes instead of just saying &quot;yh it&#39;s possible&quot; or &quot;naw&quot;.
i&#39;ve also googled this topic and i have also used the search bar multiple times. (no &quot;uze srchbar no0b&quot; pls.)

thanks, max</description>
