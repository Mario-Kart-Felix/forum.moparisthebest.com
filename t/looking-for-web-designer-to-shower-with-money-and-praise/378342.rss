    <description>Hey,
I have a project right now that requires a solid graphics + HTML/CSS guy.

Before I continue: [b]Payment for this project is to be paid as a percentage of profits, for the lifetime of the site.[/b] If you are not comfortable with that, then sorry this is not for you. As for how much that will be, who knows, however I can say that there is a niche target market ready and waiting, and a business model that is more than just &quot;throw up some google ads&quot; so the potential is relatively high. You will not become a millionaire, but you stand to earn more than pocket money. After the initial design, you will not be expected to remain &quot;on the books&quot; in the sense that there will be a high workload, but I may require the odd tweak or addition occasionally and since you&#39;ll still be getting paid you should be cool with that.

[u]Requirements[/u]:

[ul][li]Proven, strong graphics skills. Ability to take a design from blank slate through concept to polish, given requirements and a short description of vision. You&#39;ll be working only with me, and I&#39;m not much of an arty guy. My creative input will be minimal, this is on you.[/li]
[li]Ability to chop and code ([X]HTML/CSS) the layout. I will probably be rewriting the XHTML anyway to fit the app to some degree, so you don&#39;t need to be a ninja, but you need to be able to at least get the design out of Photoshop or whatever and into something a browser will interpret. I can help with this if needs be, but you gotta have something in the way of skillz.[/li]
[li]Javascript skills are a massive plus. Not required, but I&#39;d love it if you could do any JQuery stuff etc. yourself.[/li]
[li][i]Must be able to work fast.[/i] I&#39;m looking to get &#39;er done pretty quick, and I write Ruby pretty quick when I&#39;m on a mission. I&#39;m not saying you have to be jobless like me and have all the time in the world, or dedicate a certain number of hours when I say so, but if you&#39;re about to leave on vacation or start a new college or whatever, this isn&#39;t for you sorry.[/li][/ul]


Email me at pizzey.sam+wikm@gmail.com if you&#39;d like more information, or think you&#39;re up to the task.
Include desired cut and examples of work.

Peace :)</description>

<p>I do a lot of website building at work, and not just static websites. I’m awful at making designs for them, other people usually do that.</p>
