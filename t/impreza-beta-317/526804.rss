Summary:
Impreza is an attempt to breakaway from the norm of private servers while most of these servers seem to release minor updates on occasion we at Impreza believe beta is never truly over and that the best is yet to come. With that been said players need to have solid base to work with in order to help developers move the server in a direction that the community wants. I believe Impreza is a great base to built a thriving player base and a community that&#39;s ready to help grow this server into something great!

What type of server is Impreza?:
Revision:317
Are teamed placed a heavy emphasis on our servers economy when developing, everything from drops to the shops have been tuned accordingly in order to keep the economy stable. On Impreza you can play anyway you want and never be at a disadvantage.

How will this Beta playout?
The purpose of this beta is to ensure the server is ready to handle players in the sense of stability and gameplay. Not only do we hope are beta testers will find bugs but also show us what they&#39;d like to see on launch day and a basic sense of direction after launch day.

*Beta will last two weeks.
*Most active testers will be awarded donator perks for life and possibly staff positions.
*Can expect occasional downtime
*Economy will be reset after two weeks

Game Features:
*24/7 Dedicated Hosting
*15 Bosses(God wars,Corporeal Beast,Kbd,Nomad)
*5 Mini-games (Barrows,Pest Control)
*5 Great training teleports!
*Fully working Summoning, Agility, Hunter, Slayer! (Dungeoneering available after beta!)
*Great pking and Multi-pking(Mage bank, Edgeville)
*Level Points
