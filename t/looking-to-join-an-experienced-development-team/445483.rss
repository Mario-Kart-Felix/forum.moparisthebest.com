    <title>Looking to Join an experienced Development Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-join-an-experienced-development-team/445483</link>
    <description>I am looking to join a development team.  I have no preference on gameframe, type of server (PKing or Eco), or anything.  I just want to be a part of a development team that works together to get things done and enjoys what they do.


[b]What can I offer?[/b]
I am a Webmaster/Forum Head/Community Manager. I have had about 3 years of experience on 4 different servers.  I have made forums, maintained them, as well as helped the community grow.  I am hoping that I will be able to assist another development team in doing so. I am [i]not[/i] looking to join a development team with inexperienced coders or people that don&#39;t have much knowledge of running private servers. 


[b]About Me[/b]
Name: Nathan/Nate
Age: 18
Location: Massachusetts, USA
Timezone: Eastern Standard Time [EST]
Experience: 3 years of forum experience, moderate HTML knowledge.
Offering: I am offering to join a team that is already established and has dedicated players, or a new team that needs one more person to get off and rolling.
Compensation: I am not looking for any type of compensation for anything that I do.  I am also not looking to spend any money on anything that I do.  I work on private servers as a hobby in my free time, so no money is needed for my work.


[b]Contact Information[/b]
I will not post my contact information here, however if you would like to begin speaking with me please do so in the comments or in my inbox.


Please post below if you&#39;re willing to accept me to your team. Also, include a link to your thread(s) about the server you&#39;d like me to join.</description>
