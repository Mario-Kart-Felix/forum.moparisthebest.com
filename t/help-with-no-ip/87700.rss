    <title>HELP with no-ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-no-ip/87700</link>
    <description>I need help with no-ip. I port forwarded for my router and my comps firewall, and it did work fine. I was gone for 2 days and I come back and it doesnt work anymore?
[code][Mon 19:45]  Checking Remote IP Address.
[Mon 19:45]  Current IP address found, [/code]
I assume that means it is working correctly, and it says 
[code][Mon 19:52]  Updating host: 
[Mon 19:52]   : DNS is current, no update needed.[/code]
which I also assume is working correctly. I opened a support ticket and all they had to say is &quot;Are you sure it is using the right router IP&quot; and &quot;Is the update client finding the IP correctly&quot; 
Now, while i was gone, my IP changed, but I don&#39;t think that is a problem.

anybody?</description>
