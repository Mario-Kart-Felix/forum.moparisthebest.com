I went to <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a>, signed up, added a new host, used my run server file, and logged on. Everything worked, and my friend could log on so there were no problems.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
