    <description>[b]NEITHER ME OR SPEL ARE FUCKING BOT OWNERS/PSERVER OWNERS, srsly guys on rsforums. Lolmuch?[/b]


Speljohan has been examining the client. The owners of powerbot and rsbuddy have yet to see whats in for them, and they&#39;re trying to keep their userbase nice and calm. They&#39;re still probably getting script income, so why would they announce that they were stopped? This is very similar to the technique WoW used on its 4.0 Cataclysm patch that rendered private servers impossible (other than the existing ones simply loading the map files and characters) WoW didn&#39;t have a reason to put as much effort in as Jagex did.

This was no quick act at all. Remember all the news posts that basically said &quot;we&#39;re trying guys, well be improving our detection systems...&quot; They&#39;ve more than likely been taking names and really throwing a fast ball at reverse engineers.

RSBuddy will not be even operable for weeks because everything it used is now gone, and once it is operable of simply loading the client, they bots can&#39;t see anything and scripts wont work.


&lt;blockquote&gt;[b]Yohanu (Speljohan)[/b]
they&#39;ve butchered the client
for real
all instance variables are gone
it&#39;s all in a massive object array
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
so
youre basically telling me
that
jagex knew what they were doing this time? and bot owners dont know what theyre in for yet?
jacmob etc
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
yep
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
are trying to keep their community calm
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
i expected them to go this far
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
by saying &quot;oh ill have it in a few hours&quot;
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
eventually
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
so
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
basically
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
how to get around?
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
every object in game is an index in the array rite
like every part of game engine
the array is just an Object[][]
meaning you can&#39;t tell what type is in what index
and my guess is that
everytime you connect
all indices are scrambled
resulting in something even harder than making a packet bot
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
thats what WoW did
it pretty much destroyed private servers
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
ll
so yeah
this is luls
pretty sure they do reflection checks now too
as a backup
in addition to more gradual updates
looks bright
finally i can actually talk to people in game
instead of talking to walls
(bots)
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
I quoted this convo
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
mk
[b]Frell Bzigalsmichtz says[/b]
for the faggot mscp 12 year olds who think theyre badass because they can load up a bot and hit start
[b]Yohanu says[/b]
ol&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
