    <title>Adding new Environment models</title>

    <description>Hi,

I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a way to edit the games object model cache? I wan&#39;t to change a few things around mainly to add custom trees. Could someone point me as to where to start? I&#39;ve already added this on the client side in Objects.xml:

[code]
&lt;object name=&quot;Old Tree&quot; type=&quot;1275&quot; description=&quot;It&#39;s a tree. And by how it&#39;s standing, it looks pretty old.&quot;&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;[/code]

Now I need to work out where and how to add my Dat model, then how to map it to the id 1275.

If someone could help me it would be amazing.
