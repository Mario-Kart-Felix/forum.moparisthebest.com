    <title>I need VPS Help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-vps-help/356844</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried every solution someone has thrown at me and I still can&#39;t seem to run [b]any[/b] source on my CentOS VPS. 

Can someone guide me through the process of making a server source compatible for Linux hosting?

Feel free to drop a reply or add me on MSN, I just want to get this figured out.

MSN: alex@forumsource.org

Edit: I forgot to state what the problem was.

I have transferred the server files onto my VPS and I&#39;m using UltraVNC to control everything. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with UltraVNC, it&#39;s basically like remote desktop connection, though mainly used on Linux distributions. Anyways, once I locate the server files folder, I right click on it and click &quot;Run Terminal Here&quot;. Before going on, I have made sure that I have a &quot;run.sh&quot; file, so that&#39;s not the problem. Once the terminal pops up, I type in the command &quot;sh run.sh&quot;. It seems to run the server, but it tells me that several, if not all, of the &quot;.cfg&quot; files are missing. 

Edit: I tried some different things and it seem as if the &quot;.cfg&quot; error disappeared, but now I received this error.
