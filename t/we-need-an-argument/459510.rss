    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/we-need-an-argument/459510</link>
    <description>Here is the topic: People on the benefit (social welfare).

Should they have their benefit cut if they don&#39;t enrol their children with a preschool/school or GP?

Should they have the same rights as tax paying workers?

Do we need the beneficiaries to stay on the benefit in order to keep the world going?

Should they be sterilized during the time they remain on the benefit?</description>

              <p>When I was working a minimum wage job in a store, the best day for cigarette sales was when the welfare checks came out. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>in canada welfare doesn’t give much money for drugs etc, instead they give very little spending money but they pay for your housing and food. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still abused. Most of the low rental housing are full of drunks and addicts, and they manage to get luxeries like satellite tv and the fastest internet plans. But the way I see it, even if they are too lazy or too fucked to work, either we throw em a bone or they end up on the street causing crime.</p>
<p>Then there is unemployment insurance which is for temporarily unemployed people. All workers pay into it, just a small fee from each pay (i think $1.70 from every 100 earned). If you are a seasonal worker (common in canada due to winter), laid off, pregnant, etc, you can receive up 55% of your wage as long as you are seeking employment in the case of a layoff etc. It’s a great system and even generates a surplus.</p>

</aside>
<p>that’s how it goes, if a single parent can’t afford work and childcare then welfare is generally the only option</p>
<p>not to mention after taking several years break from work, career prospects are low and will put you back on the entry level position which may not be enough to support a family working full time and factoring in childcare</p>
<p>that specific system sucks regardless of what country and there isn’t really a good solution</p>

<p>$25-75(estimate) per welfare recipient per month to test for a set amount of drugs which can be faked easily enough never-mind knowing when and where the drugs will be tested for since most drugs can only be tested up to a week or two after use, and it depends heavily on the person</p>

<p>so people on welfare make ~4 times much than someone working full time minimum wage and you still argue that minimum wage is fine as it is?</p>

<p>Why are you thinking of the minimum wage as the ‘only wage’ like theres no way out?  Unlike Euro-land tons of people in the US are above the entitlement/social wage.  Ask a teenage girl what shes paid, shell probably say minimum wage. Ask anyone over 22 and it will probably be 15-16 $ an hour, and then get into all the college people</p>

<p>I would like to hear where you read that it got people fired. When people have more money, they spend more money. More spending is good for the economy. I would also think that it keeps the economy more stable, as people has more money to pay off their debt.</p>
<p>But this is about incentive to work, and there is no doubt that getting paid more, make you slightly more willing to find a job.</p>

It is waste of money.</p>
<p>Raise the minimum wage, then you would increase the benefit of working. It has been proven that it makes no difference on the unemployment rate. Of course there is a limit on how much you can change it, but a small increase make no difference.</p>

You know if you go to a rehab center on your own before you ever get arrested you cannot be arrested for it?</p>
<p>And I wont respond to the rest simply because im talking about buying black market prescription pills which can be $70 each or someshit, heroin/crack/meth.  Weed cigarettes and alcohol have a less chance of getting you killed than abusing meds or doing heroin/crack/meth.</p>
<p>It goes back to your organic milk argument. It can kill someone if you get a bad batch, it doesn’t mean it should be completely free to sell and promote as healthy. Same goes for hardcore drugs.</p>
<p>You know how much money drug tests would save if it cut thousands of people off their benefits? Leaving more to help the real struggling families?</p>
<p>And you still need to nudge people on welfare towards finding a job. Obviously I don’t mean cut them and let them flop around, but make them say “getting a real job will be more worth my time…”</p>

<p>so your idea of taxpayer money being well spent is by funding unnecessary and expensive drug tests monthly for every welfare recipient? do you have any idea how much monthly drug tests would cost? not to mention that drug tests can only find what they’re testing for and can be bypassed ridiculously easily, and I haven’t even touched on who is going to pay for it yet, because who is going to pay for it? taking it out of the existing welfare budget will mean a severe reduction in welfare for people who need it</p>

<p>You know, the ones that get expensive as fuck? The ones people steal money to pay for etc?</p>

</aside>
<p>here’s an idea, those substances are only expensive as fuck because the prohibited status of those drugs forces a black market where people can charge what they want for them</p>
<p>weed isn’t called weed for shits and giggles, it’s literally a weed which can grow anywhere and drug dealers charge out the ass for it because it’s illegal and there’s no regulation stopping them</p>
<p>oh, and legalising drugs has the added option of governments charging whatever tax they want on them and it would still cost less than the current black-market alternative, cigarettes in the uk for instance are taxed at about 80%, shops get very little profit from selling cigarettes (5-10% per packet compared to 20-50+% for other goods) and even with the ridiculously expensive cost of cigarettes very few people buy smuggled cigarettes or tobacco</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t care what people waste their money on when its their own money. When its government aid from everyones tax dollars I dont want them spending it on drugs and shit.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>so how about tobacco and alcohol, your argument for them seems to be “it’s fine because its legal” but those substances offer very, very few social and health benefits that aren’t quickly bogged down by the social and health negatives</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>and on the subject of forcing people on welfare to get jobs: it simply does not work, here in the uk the only real benefits available to unemployed people is job seekers allowance which as the name implies is given under the condition you actively look for a job, and what ends up happening is that the people on JSA get forced to send job applicants to companies with no jobs available who don’t even bother reading the applications they receive weekly and monthly and don’t end up recruiting anyone and in the few instances where people are offered to go get job experience they end up working full time get screwed over because they work full time only being paid for transport + JSA, receiving much less than minimum wage compared to people working the same job with no childcare given and if they refuse or can’t work this they get their benefits cut for no god damn reason</p>
<p>and because it needs to be said to most people on these forums: cutting welfare or benefits to people does not help the people you are cutting welfare or benefits from, and in the long run it will have an extremely detrimental effect on society</p>

<p>I already told you im only talking about illegal substances. You know, the ones that get expensive as fuck? The ones people steal money to pay for etc?</p>

<p>Nicotine addiction is pretty expensive too, and if you are aiming to prevent people from spending their welfare money on unnecessary products you’d better force them to pay for tobacco and booze with their own money.</p>
<p>Besides, I’m for welfare but it should be implemented in a way that rewards employment and discourages unemployment. This means lowering the welfare after a few months. For instance, in the Netherlands we have two ways of paying the unemployed. First, they can receive 70% of their last earned income for a maximum of 2 years. The duration is tied to how long you’ve been working before being fired. After that period ends, you still receive welfare but it’s barely enough to sustain a family. There is no money to spend on luxuries, and when your washing machine breaks down you’d better have a savings account because you won’t be able to finance it from your welfare.</p>
