    <title>Good 317?[edit] read pleas</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-317-edit-read-pleas/370697</link>
    <description>ok i am currently using tragedy pk source and its not working out i get 7+players on and clients start getting buggy and freezing.

so i am in need of a new source and client ive been looking throiugh the downloads but i cannot pick one out. really  all i am looking for is one that can host at least 100 players and i will be able to code everything i want from there.  i would love to go back to delta coding but im sure idk but i think all deltas have the comb at delay were you attack something or somebody and it takes like a 5 second delay then it attacks.  so does anybody know a good 317 thats been released that can host at least 100 players and has little to no bugs dupes glitches etc?

what client would be a good one to use for hyperion?</description>
