<p>Thanks for this anyway, but if you could try and get hold of the cache unpacker/repacker that was posted on moparscape a few days back it would be great.</p>
<p>While Iâ€™m here I had backed up a file on my phone, I think maybe it had the cache unpacker/repacker on there, and it worked very well.</p>
