    <title>Anyone here had experience with depression?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-here-had-experience-with-depression/338501</link>
    <description>Yoh.. so anyway my mate got diagnosed with depression he says (personally I believe him but others don&#39;t) and they all don&#39;t seem to think he&#39;s being serious saying stuff like &quot;man up&quot; and shit, but you don&#39;t have to be a doctor to know depression is a bit more serious than a little downer.

Anyway, just wondering if any of you have had depression; what helps?</description>

Though I am not suggesting he use marijuana, I am just throwing that out there, therapy can sometimes help, and researching his own information on the internet can be helpful.</p>

              <p>Basically different parts of your brain will ‘light up’ when in use. When 2 or more parts light up at the same time, they start to associate with each other and light up automatically.</p>
<p>This is how ‘practice makes perfect’ and muscle memory works.</p>
<p>If you’re in a sad mood and then turn on the tv, these parts of your brain will light up. Do it enough times and whenever you turn on the tv you get depressed. Obviously it can work with every action you do, which leads into a downward spiral.</p>
<p>The obvious way to break this is to think positive, which is cliche but it works. Put out good things and make a note of them, no matter how ridiculous. Then the brain starts associating the actions with happy thoughts and overwrites the old ones.</p>
<p>That’s how I got over depression without meds after having it for years.</p>

<p>i would suggest that if he really wants to help himself he at least give CBT a go, especially if he lives in a country with a decent health service and can get it cheap/free</p>
<p>with a proper trained practitioner that is, not self help</p>
<p>if he has doubts about “therapy”, point out that its not traditional whackjob “talk about your childhood” shit, its designed to be pragmatic and non-fluff</p>

              <p>[quote=“Yz85Racer, post:1, topic:338501”]Yoh… so anyway my mate got diagnosed with depression he says (personally I believe him but others don’t) and they all don’t seem to think he’s being serious saying stuff like “man up” and shit, but you don’t have to be a doctor to know depression is a bit more serious than a little downer.</p>
<p>Anyway, just wondering if any of you have had depression; what helps?[/quote]</p>
<p>to take the question seriously, he needs to regain his self confidence. find a reason to be confident. i know that is vague but it makes a big difference. maybe get a girl to go on a date with him. younger guys will get an INSTANT self esteem boost on that one <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
