    <title>Mute command doesnt work (pi) (317)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mute-command-doesnt-work-pi-317/383738</link>
    <description>Not sure how to fix it, but when the mute command is used it says you have been muted by xxxx but it doesnt actually mute the person as they are able to continue talking.

ip mute works to some extent but users can still yell.

heres my current mute command (not working)

[code]   if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;mute&quot;) &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 1) {
            try {   
               String playerToBan = playerCommand.substring(5);
               Connection.addNameToMuteList(playerToBan);
               for(int i = 0; i &lt; Config.MAX_PLAYERS; i++) {
                  if(Server.playerHandler.players[i] != null) {
                     if(Server.playerHandler.players[i].playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(playerToBan)) {
                        Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[i];
                        c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been muted by: &quot; + c.playerName);
                        break;
                     }
                  }
               }
            } catch(Exception e) {
               c.sendMessage(&quot;Player Must Be Offline.&quot;);
            }         
         }
			[/code]

              <p>Your yell command doesnâ€™t look if someone is muted. I suggest do that.</p>
<p>Honestly the whole muting/banning is very ugly done. I would not have done it that way.</p>
