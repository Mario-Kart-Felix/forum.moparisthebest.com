    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-editing-thieve-stalls-help/368817</link>
    <description>i need some help editing the thieve stall on a pi serv.
they currently give 1 item and you sell once you get a full env i want it to give cash on each stall.
i was looking around and all i could find was in actionhandler.java i found this
this is the last thieve stall its the item that it gives
[code]			case 2562:
				c.getThieving().stealFromStall(1613, 170, 90);
			break;[/code]
1613 is the item id
but thats just the item id there is no stall id or anything not even a amount id. im sure this is a easy fix somehow but idk how it works pleas help rep+</description>
