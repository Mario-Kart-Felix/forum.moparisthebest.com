    <description>ok so what i was trying to do what make new items on my server...dragon 2h was pretty easy just used the r2h inv item sprite and changed the color and used the dragon long sprite for the equipted sprite...anyways...that way doesnt really seem like a good way to do it and i was wondering how i might go about trying to make my own sprite set it up so it works...i have been looking in all the sprite files and i cant even find the sprite for like the long or anything...if that makes sense...like in the items.rscd file the sprite for dragon long is 163...but when i unpack the sprites.rscd and go to edit sprite 163 its actually a picture of a head....not sure what im really doing but ive been trying to figure it out on my own...anyone able to help me?</description>
