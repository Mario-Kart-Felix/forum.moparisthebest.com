    <description>Hey guys, 

I shouldn&#39;t really be on this forum seeing as I have no experience with RSPS &quot;coding&quot;, However I have been involved in servers for around 2 years. I thought that it was about time to own one so I started the search to find someone that was quite good with RSPS development. Having knowledge in website designing is a bonus but not a necessity seeing as there are others that can help with that. I am looking for someone with:

-Good knowledge on RSPS and has made some clients before.
-Mature, good grammar
-Skype, so we can chat.

NOTE: I don&#39;t mind if you have some close friends that you want to spread the work around with, as long as you know that they are good people it is all good.

My promise to you.
I will be as active as possible
I will write all the boring text that needs to be added into the forums!
I will look after all the players
I will work hard to recruit players
I will work hard to make this server as successful as possible 

FURTHER:
You and I will be the ONLY 2 owners of this server. All profits made will be divided into thirds. One third will be used for paying for the server e.g vps, hosting costs, advertising. etc.
The other third will be given to you and the other to me.

IF:
If you kind of want to join but aren&#39;t happy with a few of the things I want to enforce, that&#39;s fine we can chat and discuss it to suite your needs.

I have tried this with one person before and I was scammed, I will be quite cautious when handing out my money, however most of my money I earn will be put into the server.

Any other queries please have a chat to me about it.


 If you are interested please add my Skype account, &quot;spiros.daglas&quot;, and send me a message letting me know that you have read this topic :)

Thanks, I hope to find someone soon!
