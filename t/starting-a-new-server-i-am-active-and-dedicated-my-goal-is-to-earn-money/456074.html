        <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I shouldn’t really be on this forum seeing as I have no experience with RSPS “coding”, However I have been involved in servers for around 2 years. I thought that it was about time to own one so I started the search to find someone that was quite good with RSPS development. Having knowledge in website designing is a bonus but not a necessity seeing as there are others that can help with that. I am looking for someone with:</p>
<p>-Good knowledge on RSPS and has made some clients before.<br>
-Mature, good grammar<br>
-Skype, so we can chat.</p>
<p>NOTE: I don’t mind if you have some close friends that you want to spread the work around with, as long as you know that they are good people it is all good.</p>
<p>My promise to you.<br>
I will be as active as possible<br>
I will write all the boring text that needs to be added into the forums!<br>
I will look after all the players<br>
I will work hard to recruit players<br>
I will work hard to make this server as successful as possible</p>
<p>FURTHER:<br>
You and I will be the ONLY 2 owners of this server. All profits made will be divided into thirds. One third will be used for paying for the server e.g vps, hosting costs, advertising. etc.<br>
The other third will be given to you and the other to me.</p>
<p>IF:<br>
If you kind of want to join but aren’t happy with a few of the things I want to enforce, that’s fine we can chat and discuss it to suite your needs.</p>
<p>I have tried this with one person before and I was scammed, I will be quite cautious when handing out my money, however most of my money I earn will be put into the server.</p>
<p>Any other queries please have a chat to me about it.</p>
<p>If you are interested please add my Skype account, “spiros.daglas”, and send me a message letting me know that you have read this topic <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thanks, I hope to find someone soon!</p>
