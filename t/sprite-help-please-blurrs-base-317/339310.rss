    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sprite-help-please-blurrs-base-317/339310</link>
    <description>Ok, I have a Problem with my sprites this is a [317] client
based off of Blurrs Client. Ok, my problem is really 3 in 1.

[img]http://i41.tinypic.com/2mxpc05.jpg[/img]

Lets start with Yellow when I click on my clan botton
it lights up the ignore players button9As you can see I
currently have the clan tab open). how do I make it 
highlight the clan button instead(If I click the ignore 
players button it highlights the ignore players button).

[s]Now to blue. If I click on it, it opend the tab but the 
crown goes away and it becomes a red button (As if it is
highlighted). How do I get the crown to stay?[/s]

And as for red how do I utilize it? As in make it a...
staff control panel.

        Thanks,
		    FusionLord

[edit] Fixed blue.</description>
