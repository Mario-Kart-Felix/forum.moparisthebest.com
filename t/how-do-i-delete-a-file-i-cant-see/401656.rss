    <title>How do I delete a file I can&#39;t see?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-delete-a-file-i-cant-see/401656</link>
    <description>Well, theres a major worm on my computer. REALLLY not good. Considering I botted ONCE on my main for an hour and Jagex found out and I was banned and reset...-.-(ONCE, NOT EVEN A SKILL FFS)

Anyways, I know where this worm is and it opens on startup and asks me if I want to run it, as always, I click cancel and the worm releases it virus anyways so I always have to scan and remove. But I want to delete the file directly instead of having it keep doing this.

C:\Users\Tim\AppData\Roaming\drvhost.exe

Thats where it is located. However I cannot see the file, as it is invisible. How do I go about deleting it?</description>

<p>That way you can see it and just delete it.</p>

<p>I’ve already tried, that it can never find it. I’ve also tried going to the folder where this “thing” is located and making invisible files visible. Help? NEED to get this thing off my computer ASAP!</p>
