    <description>So I decided to make a Livestream, but I&#39;m having issues with how I should host films. Uploading them to the server will just get my account closed, and it takes FOREVER. I&#39;m not so sure about streaming to the server, I was wondering if there&#39;s a screen capture program that imitates a Webcam, so that Livestream will recognize it and allow me to stream. 

I was also thinking about trying to stream using VLC. Is it possible to do? If so I have no idea how, and would greatly appreciate any help. But with streaming, quality can be bad. And my PC isn&#39;t so powerful in the processor department. Screen Recorders usually lag the shit out of my computer.

I also thought I could do it somehow with a program in linux. Is there any program like that?</description>

<p>I know how to do that, it’s getting Livestream to accept the connection. As far as I know it doesn’t accept streams like that.</p>
