    <title>Metaseq Video Tutorials</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/metaseq-video-tutorials/452784</link>
    <description>Im a rather busy guy but ive taken a little time off to sorda &quot;HELP&quot; new modelers or people who want to start modeling. 
so what im going to be doing is be giving 1 on 1 modeling help via Skype to people who wish to better thereselfs.Im no pro at it myself but i have enough Exp to get you out of that &quot;tracing stage&quot; and into basic Primitive manipulation. I have never done this before but figured this would be a great way to spend my time. i will only being doing this for about a week or two so here is a list of things you need.

1. Metasequoia ( http://metaseq.net/english/download.html )
2. TeamViewer ( http://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/index.aspx )
3. Skype ( http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/ )
4. A Flexible schedule
5. Patience ( because there are alot of tools and alot of trial and error )
6. A Brain

if you are lacking any of these then you need to either get them in the time period of 1-2 weeks or you do not qualify. 
I will not leave anyone behind. if i do not get to you in the time period i set i will set another Private date for you. idk what im getting myself into but im going to try this. Im asking if any other more exsperienced modeler with time on his/her hand help me with this so we can teach more in a smaller time. and if posible id like to get a Blender &quot;Pro&quot; to do the same with People interested in blender.

i understand there are &quot;tutorials&quot; but some people like me understand by hands on and more visual exsperience&quot; if you rather have written tutorials there are some great ones stickied on the models section&quot;

If this is not the correct place to post this then by all means lock it and give me the correct location to post</description>
