You said that it was more secure to wait until you get married before have sex than use condom.</p>
<p>R.I.P RSC are right, if you use it right you don’t need to worry.<br>
Have sex with you girl/boyfriend if you want, if you are not believe in any God you don’t need to follow their rules just remember to learn how to use the condom.</p>

<p>It’s not usually teens that get aids anyway, only the chicks that whore themselves out to hundreds of older guys sometimes get it though it’s quite rare.</p>
<p>Abstinence is just fucking stupid imo.</p>
<p>Look at the middle ages, when Catholicism ruled the Brittish Empire, there was no Abstinence in fact men usually married 6 or more times in there life because there wives kept dieing whilst giving birth.  Not to mention that the average lifespan back then was around 30 so these weren’t 18 year olds or nothing, people back then started doing it as soon as they could.  Girls were usually sold by age 12 or 13 and boys usually had their first marriage at around 13-15.<br>
Also marriage back then was a contract between the groom and the father in law which had nothing to do with love but everything to do with how big the dowry was.<br>
It wasn’t until the early 1900’s that marriage has been about showing love for your lover and it’s only recently that abstinence was created.</p>
<p>Oh and yes I am ignoring Greek marriage, I know it is quite similar to ours but that’s a completely different topic as there marriage had nothing to do with religion(well Catholicism) which is pretty much the whole reason we have abstinence.</p>
<p>Really what i’m saying is that abstinence is just crap that catholic extremists enforce on the children of America and undeveloped countries.  Marriage before sex is just retarded, as i’ve explained marriage wasn’t even designed for that reason and that concept of marriage only came in a few decades ago.  If you say it’s religious, it isn’t it was only developed very recently and if you were to follow marriage according to Catholicism then don’t try to me when you’re on trial for slavery.</p>
<p>btw i’m not going against any religions or anything, if you are offended by this post in anyway then read it again you probably misread.</p>

there would be STDs still, first one person has it they get married and pass it on to their partner, they have children and the child is born with the STD as well, they go off and meet someone else and it spreads and so on</p>

<p>But the pope is seen as like the leader though.<br>
Catholics do worship the pope, if you are a catholic and you don’t then well you don’t and I know others don’t but there are MANY Catholics that do.  They don’t worship him as if he is god but just in the way the disciples would be worshiped if they were around today(and if they actually existed)</p>
<p>Actually if everyone waited until they were married to have sex we would need to live in a communist regime and there would still be unwanted pregnancies and STD’s just we could pinpoint who exactly has them and the government could roll up and take em away to do as they please.</p>
<p>Marriage does not stop you from having sex with other people.<br>
It’s something around 60% of marriages end in divorce and 70% cheat on their partner.<br>
Saying you should wait until marriage is just stupid, it doesn’t help at all.<br>
I’m not saying that having everyone whore themselves out is good that’s the other extreme, the best and only real way to prevent the spread of STD’s is by using condoms.</p>
<p>The whole thing with no premarital sex though is religious and if you read my post above you will realise that it wasn’t until only a few decades ago that it was seen as being “right” in the eyes of god to wait until marriage.</p>

<p>When the last pope died I asked “Who’s the pope?” that just so happened to be the same day I started studying religion and specifically Christianity, it was also the day I realized I wasn’t a Christian but an Atheist as I had questioned this religion I was supposed to believe in my entire life.</p>

<p>It is ‘more secure’ if everyone waited until they were married to have sex there would be no STDs or unwanted pregnancy.<br>

there would be STDs still, first one person has it they get married and pass it on to their partner, they have children and the child is born with the STD as well, they go off and meet someone else and it spreads and so on[/quote]</p>
<p>If everyone waited until marriage to have sex no one would have any way to get STDs in the first place.</p>
<p>It is hard to do this, don’t let anyone fool you, but religion has never been about taking the easy way out.  Doing the right thing is never easy, doesn’t mean we should change beliefs to make them easier to follow.</p>

<p>But the pope is seen as like the leader though.<br>
Catholics do worship the pope, if you are a catholic and you don’t then well you don’t and I know others don’t but there are MANY Catholics that do.  They don’t worship him as if he is god but just in the way the disciples would be worshiped if they were around today(and if they actually existed)[/quote]</p>
<p>I feel like a broken record here, CATHOLICS WORSHIP ONLY GOD!  It is against our religion to worship anyone or anything else, that Catholics worship anything but God is just a rumor.</p>

</aside>
<p>No I mean they worship the Pope in the same way people would the Diciples if were around today.  The pope has his status because he is considered more holy and I guess you could say the leader of Catholicism.  The thing is though Catholicism along with Christianity is a pick and choose religion, that’s one of the reasons why I think Christianity is just retarded but it’s also the reason why Christianity hasn’t turned out like Islam.  So when it comes to that i’m like on a neutral level, though it doesn’t make any sense to me how anyone could believe in a pick and choose religion it is because it is pick and choose that it isn’t at that stage of extremism yet that Islam has set.  If it wasn’t pick and choose then we’d be living like the middle ages again where people were stoned for the most stupid reasons with decreasing technological advancement.</p>
<p>Anyway back onto what I was saying, I meant that some catholics see the pope as their leader and others don’t.  Statistics have shown that the majority do, you may not but that’s because noones interpretation of Christianity is exactly the same.</p>
<p>It’s not a rumor if it is then i’ve never heard of it.  I think we all just misunderstood each other.</p>

<p>No if everyone waited we would pinpoint everyone who had STD’s and take away all the infected to be isolated so that all those who aren’t have no chance of catching STD’s.</p>
<p>Marriage was originally used for spiritial reasons in Greek times then was pretty much an exchange of goods(women) in Medieval times.  It has only been recently that religious folk have been saying not to have sex until marriage so no it’s not changing your beliefs.  The belief that sex before marriage is wrong is a belief to believing it is technically a change in beliefs.</p>
<p>The only real way to stop STD’s is to stop having sex completely, I think you can see the huge problem with that though.<br>
Latex prevents the spread of STD’s much better than paper, remember that.</p>
