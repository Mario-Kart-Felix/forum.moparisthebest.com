    <title>&quot;RSServer&quot; - Should it really be a sticky?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsserver-should-it-really-be-a-sticky/292639</link>
    <description>URL: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,384849.0.html

I don&#39;t think it should be a sticky (it currently is?) because it isn&#39;t even open-source, and it hasn&#39;t even come too far.
I don&#39;t see why it should be stuck, others have made much more progress in open-source projects/etc.
Just because it&#39;s Speljohan doesn&#39;t mean it should be an icon of the server development section.

This isn&#39;t in the &quot;Veteran Polls&quot; section because as far as I know that is for voting for new veterans.
Discuss, and vote.</description>

I’m not a fan of locking topics in internal sections (should I really have to?). I believe people will see your post and take it into consideration before making anymore replies; there isn’t anyone in here that’s unreasonable.</p>

<p>Why?  Were you voted in as a MoparScape Vet?  If you believe you should have access to their section, should they not have access to your section?  The only community members that are able to see the Veteran Polls section are the ones that were previously Vets, then were upgraded to CM.  By those members, I mean: Thug-life, Apoc, and oksuper_.</p>

</aside>
<p>The polls section is only viewable by people with the Moparscape Vet rank. You can’t see it because you’re a Community Member, and never previously had Moparscape Vet.</p>
<p>That aside, however, I’d be happy to nominate you given your contribution to the section. In reality though you aren’t really missing out on much.</p>

<p>I don’t think it should be a sticky (it currently is?) because it isn’t even open-source, and it hasn’t even come too far.<br>
I don’t see why it should be stuck, others have made much more progress in open-source projects/etc.<br>
Just because it’s Speljohan doesn’t mean it should be an icon of the server development section.</p>
<p>This isn’t in the “Veteran Polls” section because as far as I know that is for voting for new veterans.<br>
Discuss, and vote.</p>
