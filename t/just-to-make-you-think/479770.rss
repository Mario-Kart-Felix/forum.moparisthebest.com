    <description>So we as humans live, learn and &quot;die&quot;. Well how can we be sure that anything we know it true? If everything we know is influenced by the society we live in &amp; for all we know our society is being controlled by a &quot;higher power&quot; to keep us ignorant to the reality of how things are. Make us more aggressive, curious, &amp; greedy. What if we already had the answers to all our questions from the very being but were made or genetically altered to question them. What if the world we live in is a lie? How would you possibly know? Sure you can talk about atoms and the big bang theory and I could keep going, on and on, but just ask yourselves this. What made you believe that? It could very well be , what &quot;they&quot; want you to believe. A more complicated question would be, even with all this being said what can you do? Because for all we know this curiosity or answer we seek, could in fact be the desired outcome. For now we continue to live our ignorant lives , to satisfy our &quot;needs&quot; by achieving our own definition of success. To survive in what we call plant Earth.

Some of you will probably just think this is a bunch of &quot;What if&#39;&quot; questions followed by a load of crap &amp; hey your probably right but what if your wrong. At at the same time [b]this is just something to think about[/b] &amp; no I&#39;m not crazy, this is just of one of many possible things that could be happening around us; I just like to keep an open mind to anything.

Anyways I&#39;m very curious to see what you all think about this, so please leave a comment  ;D</description>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We can’t be “sure” (although I feel that’s a poor word to use - perhaps a better use of semantics would be “certainty”) that something is true or not. Many claim to be sure about certain aspects of the world, but it’s simply an irrational take. Science has mapped out all of its knowledge into a concept known as a “best fit model” of reality. For example, if you walk in a room with a table in it, then you leave, how do you know the table hasn’t flown out of the room. Can you be <span class="bbcode-i">sure</span> it hasn’t? Maybe it took a trip to the moon, then returns to its exact spot right before you enter the room. You see, these things are clearly irrational. BUT, they are not impossible to be true. They are what we call an non-falsifiable hypothesis; it’s simply not possible to falsify whether or not it’s true - but rational people don’t believe those things without evidence. So since we can’t be certain or “sure” of these things, we say it isn’t true because there’s no evidence - but really, this is just our best fit model of reality. Maybe future evidence will appear that this table theory is true, and our best fit model of reality will shift.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, we clearly don’t have answers to all of our questions. There are just so many damn questions about the world that we’ve barely put a dent in for answering. We know an estimated 4% of the world around us, as in we have answered approximately 4% of all of our questions. And again, those answers are not set in stone. We aren’t being “genetically altered”, there is no evidence of such a conspiracy. It is, however, within human nature to seek for answers (one of the great things about our human nature).</p>

</aside>
<p>I’ve already answered the “how can we be sure” question, but as for the what if - really? How crazy do you have to be to suggest it’s a “lie”? I think, you may mean something more like virtual reality? That all of this is a simulation and everything is determined? Well sure, that isn’t disprovable, but then again there’s no proof in support of it, making it yet another non-falsifiable hypothesis. However, it’s ridiculous to phrase it as you did, as if our lives are just stories told by some other being, and they “lied” in their stories.</p>

</aside>
<p>Evidence. Mountains and mountains of it. To address the Big Bang as you did, there is copious amounts of cosmic background radiation (still left over! after 14 billion years!) from the Big Bang. Also, the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate (which will tell us that billions of years in the future, the Earth will just be a stone cold planet). This is also evidence that all of space and time itself began at an infinitely small point.</p>
<p>As for the rest of your post, I really had a difficult time understanding any of it. Try to separate it better next time, and not have so many run-on sentences.</p>

              <p>There is no higher power, why? Because “higher” is the way you look at things, if you there was a power trying to control you but you didn’t see them as a higher you would not be controlled. They can try, you can give up but some people would never give up because their believe system teaches them it is not ok for them. Surely we can control our own being and choose what we like and what we do not like. Unless you give up?<br>
Interesting…</p>
<p>Human reality is really about believe system, it’s hard to break through if you try to teach someone else their believe system is wrong.<br>
Believe systems create everything for us.</p>

<p>Exactly , I agree &amp; everyone’s interpretation of who “they” is, will determine what you think about this topic; “they” could very well be One Direction to someone or “god” to someone else. That’s also another good topic about how “you can’t even with 100% certainty prove that what you are currently thinking is your thoughts and your thoughts alone” &amp; I think that falls under the category of of “ideas” which could be used to explain how we are all connected in a sense but that’s another thread entirely.</p>
<p>P.S: This wasn’t even suppose to be a “conspiracy theory”, it was just intended to make you wonder.</p>

</aside>
<p>When I said this shouldn’t be taken seriously , I meant it in the sense of . No I’m not one of those people on the street talking to themselves(and they might not even be crazy), but this is still something to think about. If you think this is a load of crap, then its working because it made you think something. Another thing I want to point out is that like Arcanian said, “There are a lot of conspiracy theories”. This is just one of many interpretations of how we can explain the reality of things. I’ve said this before but If someone told me they could break the Earth in half, I’d consider it. There are endless possibilities &amp; no one possibility is more true then the other; Theory’s or “facts” are “proven wrong” everyday.</p>
<p>@ Int Bauk : Agreed   :o</p>

<p>Maybe you’re thinking too much about something unrealistic, what evidence is there to prove a higher power? Society was put in place so that we could live peacefully together, not so a higher power could manipulate us into asking certain questions rather then others. We have more evidence to prove things which have happened through out history, then to prove that we’re being influenced. If there was a higher power, i doubt they would allow society to influence you enough to ask questions about it. There is a mental condition called paranoia that explains all of this, you may want to go see the doctor.</p>

<p>First of all I was referring to reglion and it’s influence on a “high power”(god&amp;orgods) or whatever. It’s not really paranoia because I’m not at all paranoid lol. <span class="bbcode-b">It’s just something to think about</span>. Shouldn’t be taken seriously.</p>

I was using complete sentences and my long sentences used commas. I was also began asking questions rapidly, to make you question what I’ve previously told you. Another thing is I was referring to like religion when I thought about a “higher power”. lol people should just think for a few seconds.</p>
