    <description>[center][b][size=23pt]Lawscape, The Rebirth[/size][/b]
Coming soon.[/center]


[center]Lawscape has been a great server in the past. Mabye not as great as other servers, but good. The server has been shutdown for months, shortly after V2 the thunder. It was a miserable creation, laggy, unable to log in. Now, The improved lawscape, made from the ground up, has made some extensive improvements(see below). A client has been created for maximum performance. A whole new server engine will make this server [u]lagless[/u], and very [u]customizable.[/u] Many Minigames such as [b]full[/b] castlewars, ship engagement, and soon, pest control. All suggestions will be considered. All the work done to this server is done by me only. Nobody else has done anything to the server but me. No tutorials either, except mabye for a few of Xerocheez tuts, but thats about it. All the other tuts are shit(that are not client tuts) The base which is uberly modified, is hybridscape, which has been created by Miss SilabSoft.[/center]


[b]NOTE: Before you try going on, the server will only let admins or mods. Otherwise you will get a &quot;members only&quot; error.[/b]
Major Improvements made already:
- Perfect Magic
- Perfect Mining and smithing.
- Almost all skills working

- Improved Player Handler
- Improved Npc Handler
- Improved Ban handler
- Whole new server engine, supports lawscape and mopar clients.

- Combat fighting Improved
- Bank PINS
- Hell and Heaven
- Music
- Clan interface
- Most (If not all) bugs fixed
