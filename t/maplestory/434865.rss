    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/maplestory/434865</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;MapleStory  is a free-to-play, 2D, side-scrolling massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by the South Korean company Wizet. Several versions of the game are available for specific countries or regions, and each is published by various companies such as Nexon. Although playing the game is free, some character appearances and gameplay enhancements can be purchased from the &quot;Cash Shop&quot; using real money.
 
In the game, players travel the &quot;Maple World&quot;, defeating monsters and developing their characters&#39; skills and abilities as is typical in role-playing games. Players can interact with others in many ways, such as through chatting, trading, and playing minigames. Groups of players can band together in parties to hunt monsters and share the rewards and can also collaborate forming guilds to interact more easily with each other.
 
In July 2010, the Korean version of the game was completely revised in a patch named the &quot;Big Bang&quot;. Other versions followed suit and have since received the Big Bang update. Later in the year, the Korean version received the Chaos update which introduces PVP (player-versus-player) and professions to the game. In 2011 MapleStory saw the introduction of the Jump! (Ascension in North America), Legend and Justice updates. These updates added new classes to the game such as Cannon Shooter and Demon Slayer, as well as balancing and improving older classes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I have played maplestory for a couple of years now. I for one enjoy the game, even though I don&#39;t have much time to play anymore, I play when I can. Before I go all &#39;in-depth&#39; I want everyones opinion about this game.
I also want to know when you started playing, if you&#39;re still playing, what character type are you, what do you think about the new classes, etc.</description>
