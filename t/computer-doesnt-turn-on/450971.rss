    <title>Computer doesn&#39;t turn on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/computer-doesnt-turn-on/450971</link>
    <description>I built a computer back around 2-3 years ago and now it won&#39;t turn on anymore. I was playing minecraft and the computer just shut off. Usually my graphics card driver will crash which causes the screen to turn on and off or sometimes it even restarts the computer, but this time it completely shut it down. Now when you try to turn it on, nothing happens. I switched the power supply off and back on with no results. I tried the same with the power strip I am using (everything else in the power strip still receives power). Now before I go buying replacement parts I want to figure out what when wrong. I was thinking that I burnt out my power supply because NOTHING happens when you hit the on off switch. I figure if something else was broken it would at least get power and give me an error or immediately shut right back off. So, what do you guys think broke?</description>

              <p>Power supply if it’s not powering on at all. Mine blew out a few months ago, even though my computer would still power on, I would not get any reading from the bios, so I thought it was the MOBO, well I was wrong. I’d start with the PSU, seeing as its cheaper, and most likely the case.</p>
