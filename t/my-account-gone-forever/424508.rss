    <title>My account.. Gone forever?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-account-gone-forever/424508</link>
    <description>Let me tell you the story line of this first..:
My account is old, older then you might think. Now it wasn&#39;t my first one. But, it was my best. I made it some time in 2005. Being 2011 I should be able to get veterans, but that&#39;s besides the point. Late 2010 early 2011, I started getting hacked, it went from once a month to once a week. Around April I started botting, and the hackings stopped. Well with the botting I was getting rich. I did some things I&#39;m not to proud of (stole money for rsgp) and that can&#39;t be undone. But I had around 300m for the first time in my Runescape career. Then, I was hacked, scared shitless, I recovered asap. I lost around 150 of that 300m (Blue H&#39;ween was on loan luckily.) Pissed off, I stopped playing for a couple days and let my bot do dungoneering non-stop (stupid JaGex never noticed). Again, I started paying money for RSGP.. Got back up to 500m this time. Was stupid, bought a second account, and another rare. Once again I got hacked but this time I lost it all. I couldn&#39;t even recover the account this time. I was grateful I had the second account I just bought. It was very high ranked and had some spending money on it I transferred over. Well the original owner stole it back and I lost that too. Now I&#39;m down 2 accounts and around 800m.
I&#39;ve sent in about 50+ Account theft appeals and like 20 emails. I haven&#39;t got it back yet.
Do you think I should keep trying, or just give up?</description>

<p>I’ve been told that before.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span> - My only suggestion is to stop buying anything for runescape besides a membership. Some black market accounts are targeted by the companies employees. Mainly because it’s the black market, who will you be told? I suggest making an account and playing legit for once.</p>

              <p>Let me tell you the story line of this first…:<br>
My account is old, older then you might think. Now it wasn’t my first one. But, it was my best. I made it some time in 2005. Being 2011 I should be able to get veterans, but that’s besides the point. Late 2010 early 2011, I started getting hacked, it went from once a month to once a week. Around April I started botting, and the hackings stopped. Well with the botting I was getting rich. I did some things I’m not to proud of (stole money for rsgp) and that can’t be undone. But I had around 300m for the first time in my Runescape career. Then, I was hacked, scared shitless, I recovered asap. I lost around 150 of that 300m (Blue H’ween was on loan luckily.) Pissed off, I stopped playing for a couple days and let my bot do dungoneering non-stop (stupid JaGex never noticed). Again, I started paying money for RSGP… Got back up to 500m this time. Was stupid, bought a second account, and another rare. Once again I got hacked but this time I lost it all. I couldn’t even recover the account this time. I was grateful I had the second account I just bought. It was very high ranked and had some spending money on it I transferred over. Well the original owner stole it back and I lost that too. Now I’m down 2 accounts and around 800m.<br>
I’ve sent in about 50+ Account theft appeals and like 20 emails. I haven’t got it back yet.<br>
Do you think I should keep trying, or just give up?</p>
