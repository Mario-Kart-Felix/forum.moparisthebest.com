    <title>What Am I Doing Wrong?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-am-i-doing-wrong/369395</link>
    <description>Okay, here&#39;s the problem, it&#39;s a pretty big one!  I Can&#39;t play Mopar!!! I&#39;ve tried countless times, and nothing works!  I&#39;ve downloaded it, and I start it up fine, then I go to the server status checker, find one, copy IP, paste into File&gt;New Server&gt;OK and then type in a user/pass.  Nothing works, ever!  All It says is either &quot;Unexpected Server Response&quot;, &quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down. Click &#39;Cancel&#39; then &#39;Start Server&#39; to make your own.&quot;  So I do that and I get &quot;Your account is already logged in.  Try again right now, or make another one.&quot;  And trust me, I&#39;ve made account names nobody has ever thought of.  But I CAN&#39;T GET IN!!  How can people say this is good?!!? I doubt they get to play it!!  But If anyone can help me, I&#39;d gladly appreciate it.  And don&#39;t ask me about specs and whatnot, I&#39;m good with computers, just not that good.  :P</description>
