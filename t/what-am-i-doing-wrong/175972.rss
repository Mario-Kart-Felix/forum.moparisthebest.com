    <title>What am I doing wrong</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-am-i-doing-wrong/175972</link>
    <description>I have my own server and have been trying to been making it no-ip for ages, I tried everything I looked at God of Ikiliki&#39;s Private server guide and still no luck. I followed the guide step by step, I really do not know what I am doing wrong.  I have McAfee Security Program on my computer, does that have anything to do with it?

I am really lost.

God of Ikiliki I know you were busy the last time I asked you, but if you come, can you explain?

              <p>first you might need to portforward so…<br>
go to your firewall setting and go to exeptions…add port<br>
name:rsps<br>
port:(your port ex. 43594)</p>
<p>and for the no-ip thing you need to go to the download tab at <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a> after you created account. then download it, install it, then open it(bottom right hand side of your screen) then click where it says click here to create host,make a host and use no-ip or(suggesting that)change nothing but the host name</p>
