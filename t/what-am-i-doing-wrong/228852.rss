    <title>What am I doing wrong?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-am-i-doing-wrong/228852</link>
    <description>I am new to this and have not a clue what I am doing really but I start a server and find that I am all alone in the world which I can kind of understand if I have actually started the server not just logged into an already existing one but I found that I can&#39;t open doors mine rocks or pick up things off the ground. How do I get it to do other stuff besides explore the map and kill guards?</description>

<p>Is it your server or another’s? If its anothers, then its just unpopular. If its your, try portforwarding it, because some people may not be able to log in b/c u forgot or something.</p>

              <p>Well, actually, I’ve had the problem for a while, Just trying clicking again, but just a little longer then normal. Cuase i have to click and hold for a split second and my guy picks stuff up, so , I’m not sure then. And some ladders and dorrs you can’t use cuase they havnt got anything for you to go to. If you really need to go up a building, go to your players Information, and Go to hieght, and change it to like 1 or 2, and he will be in the air. Then type ::noclip so you can walk through walls. The go where you need to. When your done with it, reverse these steps to get down.</p>
