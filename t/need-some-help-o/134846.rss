    <description>ok well here are some problems i have at moment...

a while back i had some people i neded to ip ban...
but im not sure how to do this...

i use the ::checkip cmd on my server...
it comes up saying thier ip is......

heres an example.....of one of thier ip&#39;s...
[code]adsl-68-93-97-167.dsl.rcsntx.swbell.net
[/code]

its like this...
i thought ipp&#39;s only had numbers in it...?
also...do i just wirte that into the file i got named bannedips?.....
cause when i put it in there they still were able to log in......

well thats my 1st problem.....


second problem is still related...

the people were hackers...
sorta.....
they were invisible so you couldn&#39;t click on them or anything but you can see everything they type....

is there a way i can add some protection to my server...
like game gaurd or something...only it would be free.....

anyways yea......


third problem...
this is not related to the above two...

i have a client i made...
it works perfectly when i use it...
but after jaring it...(putting it into a jar file)...

it loads..
then you log in...
then it freezes at logging in plz wait screen.....

but then when i use the jar file in a web client it loads and you can log in perfectly fine....
so yea anyone know the problem with this?........

thank you for taking the time to read this...
and thank you agian if you help.....</description>
