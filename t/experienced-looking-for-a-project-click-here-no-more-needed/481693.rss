Why would you like to join this project:For fun, and I want to return back to the private server scene since Runescape has been completely ruined<br>
How would you to contribute to this project:By making some bomb material for the server<br>
Position wanted:Server Developer<br>
Anything else you want me to know: I am a computer Science Major in my first year of college, I am currently taking my 6th Programming class which is an advanced programming course in Java. I am not a RSPS 1337 server coder, I am a legitimate programmer who knows how to write code in Java. If you have ever heard of OverloadX, I was the Co-Owner and Server developer and we did very well, We were at our peak the most popular RSPS with the most positive votes and a very active player base, over 200 players logged in at a time at any given time of the day. I have been out of the RSPS scene for awhile but want to get back into it for fun since I have free time. If you were to ever consider maybe having an extra developer to create some fun new content for your server then I am your guy <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
