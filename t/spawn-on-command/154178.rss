    <title>Spawn on Command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spawn-on-command/154178</link>
    <description>I want my barrows brothers to spawn when you use a key with a spade. Right now, All they do is just autospawn in their tomb. But I want so that when you use the key with the spade, you will tele to the next tomb, and they will spawn right next to you.
Here&#39;s what it looks like now, what should I add?

[code]else if(itemUsed == 85 &amp;&amp; useWith == 952) //Spade With Dharoks Shiney Key
                                {
                                teleportToX = 3576;
                                teleportToY = 9708;
                                heightLevel = -1;
                                deleteItem(85, getItemSlot(85), 1);
                                sendMessage(&quot;Wow,You Survived,Lets try Verac now.&quot;); 
                              }
[/code]
I would like for someone to just fix that. I know I could take some from my &quot;::npc&quot; code, but I&#39;ve tried many times and just can&#39;t seem to get it. I&#39;ve been working on it forever. Trust me, this would save me a week of frustrating &#39;yelling at my compiler.&#39;

Thank You Soo Much,

I would like for someone to just fix that. I know I could take some from my “::npc” code, but I’ve tried many times and just can’t seem to get it. I’ve been working on it forever. Trust me, this would save me a week of frustrating ‘yelling at my compiler.’</p>
