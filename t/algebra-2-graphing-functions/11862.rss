    <title>Algebra 2 Graphing Functions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/algebra-2-graphing-functions/11862</link>
    <description>Third week of school.
A+ so far in every class
Except Algebra 2.
I had all As in geometry last year.
Problem: My teacher.

Can someone please help me &quot;Graph functiona&quot;?
Here is the example in the book

Function: y= 0.2x²

Then they have a table
[center]X             Y
-5           5
-4           3.2
-3           1.8
-2           0.8
-1           0.2
0             0
1            .02
2            .08
3            1.8
4            3.2
5            5
[/center]
And thers a graph with a parabola on it.

Heres a few of the problems that i have to solve:
1) y=0.3X²

3) y=0.5²

5) y=x+3</description>

<p>get a graphic calculator, plug it in for the y= section, then press 2nd and graph, and you get the table with all the answers for the various plugins for x, its all <span class="hashtag">#s</span> possible, so pick some that you want to right down, also, for intersections and stuff use the 2nd trace stuff, algebra 2 was easy, though i got a B in the class, failed almost every test the teacher gave out, and then when we take the final state exam, i was one of the only people to get an A, so, dont stress it too much, some teachers just fucking suck at teaching, or teach funny, mine did, and i did better than the kids getting As in my class. now im taking AP Statistics, its fucking stupid.</p>
