    <title>Porn Popularity vs. Rape Incidents</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/porn-popularity-vs-rape-incidents/171626</link>
    <description>http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/forumy/2006/06/rape-porn-and-criminality-political.php

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is, however, one social factor that correlates almost exactly with the rape statistics. The American public is probably not ready to believe it. My theory is that the sharp rise in access to pornography accounts for the decline in rape. The correlation is inverse: the more pornography, the less rape. It is like the inverse correlation: the more police officers on the street, the less crime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Not really. Video games increase killing in real life, because stupid people want to play ‘Real life grand theft auto’.</p>

<p>Whilst this is true for some situations, it is not always that it had happened in their childhood, or at all for that matter, rapists aren’t ‘convinced’, per say, to commit the rapes but rather conditioned by one means or another, whether it be childhood abuse or just mental illness.

Rapers often come from families which have rapings in their history, because this behavior is taught when you’re still young and thus are easily convinced, it pays a great deal in your further life and might have effect whether you will commit rape or not.<br>

Whilst this is true for some situations, it is not always that it had happened in their childhood, or at all for that matter, rapists aren’t ‘convinced’, per say, to commit the rapes but rather conditioned by one means or another, whether it be childhood abuse or just mental illness. However don’t get me wrong, sometimes rape is just because someone is horny/worked up and then someone says no.</p>

</aside>
<p>I find it funny how you can just make claims without having anything to back it up.</p>
<p>Rapers often come from families which have rapings in their history, because this behavior is taught when you’re still young and thus are easily convinced, it pays a great deal in your further life and might have effect whether you will commit rape or not. Porn, however, will be introduced to you at your later years. This means that it will have a much lesser impact on your life.<br>
So saying that porn will make 100% sure that you will rape someone eventually is one of the most ignorant comments I have ever seen on these boards(including <a href="http://moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a>), and that says something.</p>

<p>More video games, less killing in real life is probably another one.</p>
<p>(I’m just tired of people against things like video games and porn sites.)[/quote]</p>
<p>That, even as a video game fan i do not agree with.</p>
<p>Some games go into great lengths of detail into killing, cutting, slicing, shooting etc. Something you would not usually see in every day life. Seeing more violence provokes more violence.</p>
<p>I know a young person who after playing grand theft auto, anytime you annoyed him. ‘Im gonna kill you now’, also started exercising violent behavior…They were stopped from playing it and now are sound :).</p>
<p>How does a video game remove your frustration and violence? If i’m pissed off i might go play a game to chill out but if i get angry, a games not going to stop anything that follows it. Its quite easy to loose yourself in games and get depression.</p>
<p>Please note. This comes from a huge Resident evil fan. I also have a ps3 and a good few games.</p>
<p>As for the porn stuff, i guess that relieves sexual tension which would course rape?</p>
<p>Games could however allow expression of anger if you play a ‘beat em up game’. However if you loose, you can find yourself getting even more angry lol.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to all cases however if people were kept to the game ages i reckon it would be fine and it wouldn’t have any violent impact because people actually properly know real from fake. A 11 year old playing an 18 game(yup, I’ve done it. haven’t we all.) (no matter how old they think they are) is not good. I do learning support with children ages 12-13, one whom has learning difficulties (ADHD). He brags about all the films he watches, grudge, scary movie etc. He says he’s old enough to watch them all. Well from his perspective yes, however everytime he disrupts the class its with a quote from a game or film(which is inappropriate). (someone got a question wrong and he shouts out ‘You been smokin too much marawana’)</p>
<p>parents play a major part.</p>
