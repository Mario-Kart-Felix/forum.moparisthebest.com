<p>It means that the client (MoparScape’s) wasn’t able to open a connection on your server to connect to it.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Most private servers can’t be connected to by the MoparScape client because its built to handle basic servers. If your server files have been modded in anyway (such as custom items, required client ID’s) it wont work. Best action would be to get your own client so you can make sure everything runs smoothly.</p>
