    <title>GFX Designer!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/gfx-designer/356912</link>
    <description>I am in need of a GOOD GFX Designer for my forum and server. You will get regular player permissions, but will get a special purple and bold name with an icon next to it on my vBulletin forums. Here is the application to apply.

[CODE]Your name (As it will appear on my forum):
What time zone are you in? (GMT - *):
How long have you been doing GFX:
How long are you on the computer per day (Approximate):
What program do you use for GFX:
If I ask you to do something, will you do it ASAP?:
At least 3 examples of previous work:
MSN or Jabber that I can contact you on:
[/CODE]

I will check back at this thread regularly. Thanks.

P.S. - GFX designers MAY have a better chance of getting mod, depending on how good you are. I may also be looking for more than one! No guarantees on either of those things. Thanks,
