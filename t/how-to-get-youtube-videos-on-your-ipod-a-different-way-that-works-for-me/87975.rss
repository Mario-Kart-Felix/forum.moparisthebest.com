    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-youtube-videos-on-your-ipod-a-different-way-that-works-for-me/87975</link>
    <description>Ok this isnt online, but it actually works for me.

1. Plug your iPod in
2. Go to http://ares.mp3.es/ and dl Ares Tube
3. Launch Ares Tube
4. Use the browser in Ares tube to find a good video, once you got it, go to the link
5. Once you&#39;re at the video, on the far right side next to the space where you type the link, there should be a circle with a + in it. Click it.
6. In the bottom box, select the link you just added to the download list and click download on the right.
7. Once it&#39;s finished, click remove completed and do more!

Note:
You can have more then one download in the download list at a time, just click the remove completed button so that you don&#39;t get confused which ones are done and which ones aren&#39;t ;)</description>
