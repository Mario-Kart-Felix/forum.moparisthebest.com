    <title>Party Room change</title>

    <description>[code]
It seems that Party Pete was so busy partying that he forgot to inform everyone of a change to his Party Room!

You see, Party Pete is on a life-long mission to bring the &#39;party&#39; to everyone on RuneScape, so he has developed an unlikely partnership with the Bank of RuneScape. Through this alliance, he believes that the &#39;party&#39; will spread like wildfire.

Now, when the Party Room lever has been pulled, different things will happen according to the market value of the items in the party chest:

    * A value of up to 50k: there is a 10 second delay before the balloons drop.
    * 50k - 150k: there is a 1 minute delay before the balloons drop. The Falador bankers and Party Room barmaids will announce that a party is happening.
    * 150k - 1 million: there is a 5 minute delay before the balloons drop. The Falador men and women, bankers and Party Room barmaids will announce that a party is happening.
    * 1 million+ : there is a 10 minute delay before the balloons drop. The Falador men and women, bankers and Party Room barmaids will announce that a party is happening. Nearly all the bankers across RuneScape will also announce that a party is happening, and will offer free teleports to the Party Room.

The bankers have entered into this agreement as they believe it will stop the Party Room being used as a means of transferring wealth covertly.

Well that&#39;s fucking gay, what about if you wana have a drop party with just you and your friends?</description>

How does this affect if you want to have a drop party with your friends? It makes no difference… Just a timer? Correct me if i’m wrong.<br>
[/quote]<br>
all players on that server that are in a bank will be informed about it, and are given 10 minutes to get there, and are given a free teleport there</p>
<p>i didnt know people even used the party room, so it shouldnt be a big change[/quote]</p>
<p>free teleport you say? hmm ill go check that out later</p>
<p>anyways if you want to have a drop party with your friends just put the crap in your inventory and run around putting it in random places… go somewhere private aswell…</p>

              <p>The best thing to do would to just have drop parties the old way by just dropping the items. Cuz those are, IMO, the best ways for private parties.</p>
<p>Another solution would be for Jagex to finnaly just release a house drop party system so players can enjoy their privacy and not get mowed down by noobs.</p>
