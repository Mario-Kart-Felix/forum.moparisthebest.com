    <title>One of the best way&#39;s to get mage exp without losing money!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/one-of-the-best-ways-to-get-mage-exp-without-losing-money/193958</link>
    <description>[size=12pt][b]This is really sloppy work &amp; I was really tired last night and just put it down on here... So Imma fix it when i get the chance to again, gtg to sleep now...[/b][/size]

Im not gonna make this perfect, but I am going to make it straight forward and to the point of this thread, so lets me start off to say that our main goal is to get &#39;infinity top&#39; which currently cost 1813k at lowest price:

Go get the points at mage mini game near duel arena and get the following points:

Telekinetic Points 	Alchemist Points 	Enchantment Points 	Graveyard Points
        400 	                    450 	                 4000 	                  400

Just buy 3k cosmics, 12.7k airs, 2.1k nats, 9.6k fires, 700 laws, and 680 water &amp; earth runes. This would cost you 1749k leaving you with a profit of approximately 64k.

[hr]

I&#39;ve heard that you can get about 96k exp by using a bot, so I calculated that to the 13m exp that leads to a nice level 99. From the look of it, it would take you about 5 or basically 1 week letting your bot play 10 hours a day straight. You&#39;ll get it. Also Here is what I did to get the solution:


&lt;blockquote&gt;    Telekinetic Points 	Alchemist Points 	Enchantment Points 	Graveyard Points
            400 	                    450 	                 4000 	                  400

    -*Amount | Rune-Name | Price(Max) | Total-Cost*-
    3000 Cosmic Rune = 170gp ea = 510,000gp
    12,700 Air Rune = 16gp ea = 203, 200gp
    2,120 Nature Rune = 300gp ea = 636, 000gp
    9,600 Fire Rune = 16gp ea = 153, 600gp
    700 Law Rune = 321gp ea = 224, 700gp
    680 Water Rune = 16gp ea = 10, 880gp
    680 Earth Rune = 16gp ea = 10, 880gp

    Infinity Top Cost at lower price: 1813k
    All rune cost together: 1749k
    Ending Result: 64k&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;    96k = 1hr
    1hr x 10hr = 960k(or approximately 1m)
    10hr x 13hr = 12,4m // So then there would need to be at least 1 week of 10 hours a day put into this
    Level met: 98
    Experience Left: 600k // so thats like 180 hours put into it for 99....yeah lol long&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Btw this was done on paper lol</description>
