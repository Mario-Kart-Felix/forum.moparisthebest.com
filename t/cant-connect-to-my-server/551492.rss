<p>You was right they did have a guide but i still feel something is wrong here, the static ip thing i don’t need i don’t think i never used it before when doing this! but here download my rsps, edit your run and put in your updated jdk and click run.<br>

<p>What on earth is all this? From what I can make of your poor english, you are asking to connect your computer to your “fiances” server?</p>
<ol>
<li>What is her ip?</li>
<li>Has she port forwarded?</li>
<li>Make sure you replace localhost with her ip on your server files</li>
<li>Check, “<a href="http://canyouseeme.org" rel="nofollow noopener">canyouseeme.org</a>” if the port is visible</li>
<li>If you are using No-IP, is it running in the background?</li>
<li>Make sure the server is running…</li>
</ol>
<p>It really isn’t hard.[/quote]</p>
<p>1: Her ip is same as mine.<br>
2. Yes she has port forwarded cause i figured she would need it.<br>
4. Yes it is.<br>
5. Yes server is running.</p>

<p>I’m trying to connect my computer to hers, the ip i gave you is my ipv4 address and not sure if i set it to static and i couldnt find exactly a guide on portforward so i did it myself my router is tp-link so its pretty basic. i have this. and yes the service port i have it selcted to “select one”</p>

              <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:2, topic:551492”]You tried to connect to a server on a <span class="bbcode-u">different</span> computer using 127.0.0.1?<br>
127.0.0.1 is localhost. Which means, LOCAL only. A.K.A, only your PC. So if you set the IP address to 127.0.0.1, that would mean you’re trying to connect to a port on <span class="bbcode-u">your</span> computer.<br>
If you want to connect to a computer on the same network, you need to change the IP address to the IPv4 address of that computer (The ip that people use to port forward, and is found in the windows network and sharing center)</p>
<p>If you want to connect to a computer <span class="bbcode-u">outside</span> the network, you must connect to it via their broadcast IP (The IP that can be found on <a href="http://whatismyip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://whatismyip.com</a> )</p>
<p>Note: It should/may be possible to connect to the computer on the same network using their broadcast IP[/quote]</p>
<p>I dont know whats going on i done it before, now its not working… mhmm…</p>
