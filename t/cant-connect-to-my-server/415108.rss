    <title>Cant connect to my server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-my-server/415108</link>
    <description>okay so i used to have my own private server, i shut it down. then i upgraded my computer to windows 7 ultimate. i decided to make another server the other day, so i coded a source a little bit, forwarded my ports, opened no-ip and got everything running. but when i try to log in by connecting to the local host of 127.0.0.1 it wont let me. i tried putting in the no-ip address and it still wont let me. and then i tried my actual ip and it still wont let me. it seems like something in windows is block me from connecting and i opened ports 43594 in my windows firewall on tcp/udp. if you guys think you might know a solution to the problem please let me know asap!</description>
