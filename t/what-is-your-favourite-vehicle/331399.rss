I prefer to go with American cars, as every import I have driven, I have done emense work on. The cavaleir i have, has had 1 belt break, and 1 tensioner pulley replaced in the last 3 years. Engine is reliable, gets great mileage, and moves great for its cost.</p>

<p>McLaren F1, born 1991, just an unbelievable piece of engineering. It’s records have been broken, but for the type of car and for the time, it’s just a piece of pure brilliance.</p>

<p>Sorry I hadn’t replied, 400 Bad Request when using Firefox to come on here - It cost me 1.1 when I got it but it wasn’t in good condition at all, so after spending a futher 500 on it I got it ready to be modded out bodyworking wise.</p>

All of my American vehicles are reliable too, and very powerful.  Only one is good on gas though, that would be srt8’s 1995 Pontiac Grand Am with a decently powerful V6, it gets 30mpg on average, 32 on good days.</p>
<p>My other vehicles get 11, 12, 15, and 18 mpg, for a 1973 6.5L 400 V8, 1990 7.4 Liter 454 V8, 1989 4x4 5.7L 350 V8, and 1992 4x4 4.3L V6 respectively.  So as I said, reliable, powerful, not good on gas mileage, but VERY fun to drive. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

<p>When you say reliable does that mean that you have not had to do ANYTHING besides what was specifically listed in the owners manual for each mileage milestone? Such as oil, transmission fluid, brake fluid, brakes, tires, timing belt, etc. Because thats what I mean and I assume thats what lawl means. To date my dad has no problems with the accord, my mom has had only 2 problems with the Honda odyssey and it was at 130k miles and it was under $500. I bought a used acura mdx pictures on here somewhere and I only had to do 100k maintenance which was timing build, water pump, and a broken VSA sensor (probably from the retard before me who drove it like a racecar) all that for about $900, and all that includes labor from Honda mechanics.</p>
<p>If you can tell me that you have had minimal problems/repairs that have not been too costly then I will certainly respect american cars a little more for proving my whole conception of american cars being shit/unreliable wrong.[/quote]<br>
in 4 years the only problems my dad has had is with some brake related thing needing repair and wheel alignment. none of it was expensive to fix</p>

<p>Anyway, all of them use tiny, weak engines and, from my experience none of them last as long as a well-built American car.  (Case-in-point being my 1989 S10 that ran 312,000 miles before the engine blew)  Plus they are much more expensive and harder to work on than an American car.<br>
[/quote]IN America. American cars are expensive as fuck here, not to mention the parts are expensive as fuck too. Also, gas is actually expensive here, which means buying a car that drinks &gt; 1.2 litres/mile (mile as in 10km) would be wasting all of ur money on gas.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s a fair point that American cars are much more expensive there than here in America.  But also 1 mile = 1.609344 kilometers, not 10.  It’s also no one’s fault but your own (or your governments, which is still your fault) that gas is so expensive over there (taxes, right?). [/quote]</p>
