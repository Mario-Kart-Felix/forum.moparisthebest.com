    <description>1. ok, i am wondering how do i make a item so only admin+ can use.
basicly i want to know how to make a item not spawnable under playerights 2.

if anyone can help, thanks.

2. i want to make a shop (which i have) which sells rares (i have) but i want to make it so you dont play money, you pay pk points for them.
anyone can help me, thanks.

related: i have got pk points when you kill someone but i want it to say that you have just recieved 1 pk point.
like make it so i can use a certain amount for the shop but you gotta kill players for them.

if anyone can help me with these codes and where to put then thanks, 

please help me with both as much as you can.

thanks, 

luke.</description>
