    <title>Refactoring the 474 Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/refactoring-the-474-client/451644</link>
    <description>I decided I&#39;m going to try and refactor as much of the 474 client as I can while writing a server alongside it. The client I used was the one provided at r-s that included the user-made 474 maps (digistr), so it already contained a couple renamed classes (but not really much for inside the classes).

These are all of the classes I have pretty much entirely refactored:

[b]Note:[/b] [i]This only includes method names, field names, [s]removal of dummies [local usage][/s], parameter names, parameter dummies, shift modding (aka making -311437664 become 32), number compares, and other unneeded things. Static variables and methods won&#39;t be counted as whether or not the class is fully refactored.[/i]
[b]Note2:[/b] [i]The sources on the repository may not always be up-to-date.[/i]
[b][i]Note3: Due to the client failing and me having to restart since even the earliest revision was messed up, I will leave dummy parameters and variables in the client for now until I can find where they&#39;re used and remove them safely.[/i][/b]

-ArrayOperations
-Resource
-&quot;RSFile&quot; (Class 70 - I need a better name for it)
-RSSocket

Here are some classes that I have almost finished refactoring but there&#39;s still a couple methods or fields I don&#39;t have done.

-ISAAC
-JString
-PacketStream
-Signlink
-Stream

I&#39;d also like to say I am not aiming for a full refactor, or even anything close. I want to refactor as much as I can that involves server-related work, such as logging in or player updating. I try to completely refactor classes when I feel they&#39;re small enough, have a large impact, or I feel like it. I&#39;ll also be the first to say I don&#39;t know how nearly half the stuff in the 317 client works, especially when it comes down to rendering or dealing with other complex systems, so those probably will be badly named if I even attempt to rename them.

<p>Anyway, I’m satisfied with the progress I made today. After rolling back, again, I managed to fully refactor the RSSocket class, refactor a bunch of the Signlink class, refactor just about every read/write method in the Stream class, fully refactor the “RSFile” class (Class70 - I need a better name for it) and I think make a couple of other changes. I need to redo the Resource class (Class23), but that shouldn’t be hard as it’s only like 7 or 8 things.</p>

              <p>So after experiencing this issue twice, I think I’ve learned my lesson. Last night, I had to wipe out the entire repository because there was a bug I couldn’t fix that actually ended up being there on the first revision but I didn’t notice since I hadn’t been testing with logins. The bug actually caused this:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/Mpvf" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>So after I restarted, I refactored a bunch and up to revision 3 on the repository was good. Last night I guess I forgot to test stuff, and this morning when I woke up to test everything after making a few changes, that same bug had occurred and was there on revision 4. I was unable to find the cause, so I had to grab revision 3 and go from there. Now, I fully test the client after making a few changes, because clearly there’s been a mistake I’ve made twice now that I can’t find. I’ve recently realized all the mistakes I could make because of how the client works and the obfuscation makes puzzle pieces fit, so now I’ve just got to be extra careful and not blindly change things I automatically think are right. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
