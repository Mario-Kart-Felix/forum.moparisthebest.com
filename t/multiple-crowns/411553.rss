    <description>Hi,

I am trying to make it to my server has, Moderator Crown for Player Rights = 1, Admin Crown for Player Rights = 2, And Owner Crown for Player Rights = 3, but IDK how to do this...  Could someone please help me?

I am also trying to figure out on how to make an Advisor Spot, but IDK how to make the spot.

I could care less about the Advisor Spot right now though, I just want to know how I can add separate crowns for separate playerrights..

I am using a PI based source</description>
