    <title>What is in the client that makes editing so detectable?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-in-the-client-that-makes-editing-so-detectable/83815</link>
    <description>We have all heard about how editing the client automatically flags your account, because the server makes a check with the client.

My question is exactly how does this work? And where is the file in the client which contains it?</description>

<p>Note: If you want to be able to play with the deob without having to worry about getting legit accs banned, you can modify the deob to use a different path or file. Search for “file_store” or “uid.dat” and you will find the code that deals with it.</p>

<p>I’ll agree with that.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about losing a few accounts, then really the best way to learn is to take what people have said and try it. It would be unwise to just take a <span class="bbcode-i">cheating</span> community’s word on anything. Find out for yourself taking the things they have said with a grain of salt. It really is the best way to internalize anything concerning the client and how it works.</p>
<p>One thing I would really suggest though is save your <span class="bbcode-i">current</span> uid and store it someplace safe (for non-hacking moments). Also, I would lightly suggest learning how to use socks proxies.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>We know several hard facts about detection, but a lot of what people talk about is just speculation.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jagex has the ability, via reflection, to check method/field names and access flags, to invoke methods and send their return values to the server, and to get and set the values of fields. However, they don’t necessarily do all or any of these at a given time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jagex has placed, in many methods, variables which are referred to as <span class="bbcode-i">method counters</span>.<br>
The code looks something like this:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">private static int errechnenScheisse() {
  counterAB34++;
  ....
}</code></pre>
<p>In theory, they could use the above mentioned reflection methods to grab the value of a counter and compare it. I haven’t thought about it in a long time, to be perfectly honest - someone who’s more up to date with the client should start logging reflection actions so we know what they actually do.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the client is run as an application (or any time that the game’s own frame isn’t null), the client sends a unique number to the server (like an error code).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a certain byte in the login packet equals one (which it always does now), the client maintains and transmits a log of your last 40 (or something near) mouse clicks in a hash that also contains position delta and timing information. This is not the only information about your game state that the server harvests. In case of an extensive investigation, a Jagex employee could perfectly recreate what you see while playing the game (so humanlike mouse behaviour is important).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people’s deobfuscation processes or sloppy edits interfere with the client in some way that is detectable to the above methods. However, there are some things that people only think might contribute to being banned.</p>
<p>Conjectures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sharing a UID, IP address/hostname, or client instance with a ‘dirty’ account might cause your ‘clean’ accounts to come under scrutiny. The UID-purge in particular is an item of faith among SCAR users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has been suggested that Jagex has implemented unique identifiers on all items, so that the flow of duped and macroed items/gold can be easily traced and the characters involved with it banned. The common solution to this fear seems to be transfers through multiple characters. Personally, I would consider REAL laundering via market sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people think that Jagex checks whether or not you’ve loaded the game via the RuneScape website by comparing your game IP to recent web logs (or something similar). This is entirely possible- but, as with other guesses about what Jagex does serverside, there’s no proof one way or the other.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>rather than hack up their methods of detection, just stop your methods being discovered, be it by redefining the class, modifying the reflection to throw a relevant error, or pre-/post-fixing your fields with a varying [, preferably non-ascii,] character.</p>

<p>There are a few things. First and foremost, we have reflection checks.<br>
Search for “java.lang.reflect” among the client classes, and you will come up with some methods that invoke methods, get information about classes/methods/fields, and can send this information to the server. So what ends up happening is, if the client is edited/refactored &amp;c, the server <em>might</em> know about it, depending on how Jagex implements these checks.</p>
<blockquote>We have all heard about how editing the client automatically flags your account</blockquote>... untrue. There are dozens of edits you can do that go beneath the radar on Jagex's part. They _cannot_ CRC their own classes, apart from checking their .dat cache files, and those checks are done in the loader, not the true client. 
<p>There are of course things like method counters and execution timers, but these are only relevant if you severely edit the code.</p>
<p>The extent of the edits, and whether Jagex have sufficient API or resources to check them decide whether you will be found out or not.</p>
