    <description>So pretty simple, i&#39;m trying to create a portal that takes you to a minigame. BUT, in order to use it, you need to have no items in your invintory or on you. I&#39;ve already made it so you can&#39;t have anything in your invintory, but if anyone knows what the code would look like to basically say &quot;if the player is wearing no items&quot; i would be very thankful  :P</description>
