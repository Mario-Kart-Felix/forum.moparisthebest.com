<p>Ok, first let me say something, if your thread was <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,193711.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">breaking the rules(Click here)</a>, I will warn/moderate or even mute you for it, this is a CLEAR indication it was breaking the rules, but in the case it was deleted and you KNOW it was breaking the rules, but you got away without punishment, do NOT repost it, or ask here about it. However, if it was deleted and you know it wasn’t breaking the rules(go, read them to be 100% sure), post the EXACT title, or as best you can so a mod can check through the “deleted thread” section and see what went wrong.[br][size=1]Posted on: September 29, 2007, 16:59:13[/size][hr]</p>
<p>There seems to be some confusion about development team threads, so I’ll say what is allowed, and what’s not:</p>
<p>Allowed:<br>
Posting of Instant Messenger addresses(msn, yahoo, aim, icq ect).<br>
Posting IRC network and channel details.</p>
<p>Not allowed:<br>
Posting your forum link, or posting an IM address simply to get them to go to your forums, saying ‘PM me for the link’ nor ‘Read my sig for the link’. This IS just as bad as linking to it in your post.<br>
Offering MOD or ADMIN spots, this is a development team not another way to advertise your server.</p>
<p>As an example, an ideal situation of a Dev. team thread would post IM addresses or IRC channels to communicate, use the forums built in <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=pm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">PM system</a>, or communicate through the thread.</p>
<p>And as the “bad” example, your Dev. team thread would link to your forums, or just link to your server. This is <span class="bbcode-b">advertising</span>, not a team for developers in the server.</p>

Please take time to read these or you will be sorry.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1. Nothing other than development help!</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">If your post is about the development of private servers, it belongs here, otherwise not. This means no threads asking for moderator threads, advertising dev. teams to your forums, or anything like that.<br>
To remember: Means compilers are also not allowed, they have nothing to do with the development of private servers.</span><br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">2. No help threads</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">We accept anyone who helps people, but making a ‘Post here for help’ thread goes too far, just reply on threads asking for help.</span><br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">3. Be meaningful in your topic</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Your topic title must have something to do with your problem, do not just add ‘HEEEEELP ME’, and try to be as descriptive as you can. Also try reading the FAQs or the tutorial forums before you post a thread.</span><br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">4. Already answered</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">You may want to check if that question has already been answered previous to your questioning. It will save us and you a lot of time that can be used for other things, for example the Silabsoft client questions in the Silabsoft Client FAQ and Help thread.</span><br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">5. No advertisements</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">You may not post any link to your own site in this section. This section is strictly for asking all questions regarding RSPS (RuneScape Private Servers) and Development (Teams). Any other topics and polls that do not have direct relevance with the above description will be removed.<br>
Posting links in this section to a development team’s website will most of the time result into mutes or moderations.<br>
Moderators may NOT and do not give random people permission to break this rule.</span><br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">6. No rewards</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">RS Cash rewards, real cash rewards or such are not allowed.<br>
The only reward you may give is reputation, but there is no need to say ‘Help and get REPPPPPPPP’.<br>
Just ask for help, and if they helped you give them some, otherwise they come for rep, and not to help you.</span><br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">7. No non-serious ‘development team’ topics</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">Do not post so called ‘development team’ topics here that are centered around a forum. If the focal point of a development team topic is forum information then it will be locked and removed.<br>
Applications based on ‘Server Admin’ and ‘Server Mod’ are count as non-serious development teams also.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Do NOT forget to read the rules found <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,193711.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here(click here)</a>.</span></p>
