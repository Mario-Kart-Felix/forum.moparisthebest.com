    <title>Need help badly!</title>

    <description>I recently got a new source for a project. It is perfect in every way so changing is really not an option. It has a client that goes with it but is missing files including EGUI.java so kinda F&#39;d.. I would like someone to help me fix the source so it doesn&#39;t require this client to play. It is a 317 delta, by the way. If you can&#39;t explain it in a reply but know how to fix it, please contact me on skype I will be on all day.
