    <description>I&#39;ve had this problem all weekend long now!
I&#39;ve had my server for a while it was working perfectly everyday I would click runserver and it went online and it was all good.... yesterday I came home and clicked it and it said it was online but when any of my players tried logging in they got &#39;Error connecting to server&#39; and on the cmd for the runserver, it looks like noone ever even attempted to connect...
I&#39;m using SilabSoft client, And I was able to connect to my server for some updates to it and stuff on the moparscape client however when others tried connecting with moparscape it didnt work for them...
Help?!
Oh, And i&#39;m also able to connect to other servers on silabsoft... its just not working with mine...
i used the old hiyascape as my base as a side note...</description>
