    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-co-owner-that-can-code/471001</link>
    <description>Okay i know this isn&#39;t going to look professional but i simply need a co owner that i can trust and can fix a few bugs that i cannot fix on my server i have a website and a player base of about 10-15 players. If your interested inbox me your Skype name.
