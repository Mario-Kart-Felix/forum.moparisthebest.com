    <title>Conquest 2.0 PvP Alpha</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/conquest-2-0-pvp-alpha/545201</link>
    <description>With the release of some systems I made for PvP I&#39;d really like to test them out more thoroughly therefore I am going to be putting the server up for some SPAWN/SET LEVEL PKing.

You can spawn whatever item(s) you like you can use this to find items: [url=http://www.itemdb.biz]ItemDB | 745[/url]


Please use this to get connected: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27803395/client.jar


Some Media:


Anyhow, this is my take on a Targeting System (something like Bounty Hunter), note, this isn&#39;t force upon the players to get assigned a target you must enable Target Finding first, this is only a way for PvPers to get paid a little better.

Anyhow it works like this, when in the wild and searching for a Target you can get assigned a target that is any of the following:
~10 Combat levels lower than you - Classified As: Overqualified
~10 Combat levels higher than you - Classified As: Underdog
= Combat or 5 Combat levels higher or lower than you - Classified As: Even

If you win being the Underdog of course the reward will be better, overqualified fighters take a small cut off of their pay, and the even fight is a decent payout.


I just made a video of the base system here:
