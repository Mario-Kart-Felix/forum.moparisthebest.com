    <title>[PI] DefiantPk - Where your gear gets better and better</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-defiantpk-where-your-gear-gets-better-and-better/520432</link>
    <description>[center]
After many attempts to make many servers before, and only few succeed by a hair, I have decided to go into deep development for about 6-12 months literally. But that includes vacations, school, homework, and crap I have to deal with. I am working on DefiantPk. It is a PVP server that has the ability to skill for money, you can do commands like ::melee, ::mage, ::range, ::vengrunes, ::barragerunes, ::hybrid, and much more to PVP. I want it to be amazing, that&#39;s why I&#39;m going into major development. I can also use some help which can be found in the Recruitment spoiler.

Features Planned with Small Explanation
[code]
Cash - You will need to earn cash to purchase some objects that do not come with PK kits.

Upgraded Armor - Shown below is some armor that goes from one stage to a stronger stage. You need to purchase the upgraded gear/weapons by donating or earning major money.

&quot;Defiant PKer&quot; - Defiant PKer is an NPC that is near the Wild on the server who is pretty hard to defeat, you probably need the best type of food. He has a small chance of dropping a big lump of DefiantPk Tokens (a rare token used to claim things such as torva or upgraded gear).

Titles - There will be a loyalty shop with titles, the &quot;loyalty points&quot; are actually a kill count of how many players you&#39;ve killed to get better titles.

Squeal of Fortune - We have a simple SOF feature, I really hope to improve it with the help of some developers and time.

That&#39;s about all for now.

Recruiting/Need Help
[code]
We desperately need some money to get the VPS and stuff up, but that can wait as I said I don&#39;t plan it to be released very soon. But if you want to please notify me, you will get extreme donator even if you donate a low amount.

Developers - Message Me/Comment 0/1 Needed

Moderators/Admins/Server Helpers - Message Me/Comment (A lot needed)

I still have a lot to be done, and I&#39;ll use this post to keep anyone who is interested updated.

Oh, well I have most of that anyways for donors.</p>

Thanks for the suggestion, I’ll try to work through it.</p>
<p>My idea is to make the upgraded armor stronger, of course. It is a really good idea, I have a feeling many people will really like it, but I have a lot more planned than just that.</p>
