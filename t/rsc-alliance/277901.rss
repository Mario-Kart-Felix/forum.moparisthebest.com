    <title>RSC Alliance</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-alliance/277901</link>
    <description>[s]In the face of Jagex with the possible resurgence of RSC and the constant DDoS attacks that have been made against our many RSC private servers, I believe an actual alliance could greatly benefit the mature private servers. Furthermore, wether or not DDoS attacks are a problem, I believe we could each mutually benefit through the use of an affiliate system to help grow our Google Page Ranks. We could call this RSC Alliance.

*]Servers that have been online and public for at least three months would be eligible for joining the alliance
*]The owners of each server would be requested to use MSN messenger and share their MSN name with the other private server owners to provide a direct line of communication in the event of a crisis. MSN is a middle ground, whereas IRC could be monopolized by the chatroom owner.
*]Each member of the alliance would need to have a special area in view of the public on their website where a logo (supplied by each server owner) with a corresponding hyperlink on the image, for each alliance member&#39;s server, can be displayed. This needs to be in a Googlebot-indexable location.
*]Members of the alliance would hereby agree to:

  1.) No member shall advertise on each others private servers via spam or attack posts and condemn any rogue attempts made by third parties.
  2.) No member shall preform, aid, support, request, or ask to cause a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS attack) another alliance member&#39;s RSC private server.
  3.) Any server that is a part of the alliance and that is under a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS attack) with a clear, proven attacker, shall come to the aid of that server and either:
    a.) engage in a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS attack) against the attacker OR
    b.) help in reporting the attacker to their ISP for the malicious activity.

*]Each member of the alliance may vote upon the application of a server requesting entrance to the RSC Alliance.
*]All official alliance communication shall be held on the Moparscape.org RSC section(s) middle ground.
*]Only one pre-designated Moparscape forum user name may be used to speak on behalf of each alliance member.
*]In the event of a disagreement between two alliance members, a topic shall be created and each alliance member may be granted one official vote.


RSC Alliance members:
DARScape - username: darscape
RscR - username: Anc13nts253, Adu


If your server meets the requirements listed above and you wish to join this alliance, please post in the topic below. All spam posts will be requested to be deleted by a moderator.

Affilate page example:
[url=http://darscape.org/index.php?show=affiliates]http://darscape.org/index.php?show=affiliates[/url][/s]

Yeay, nobody cares. /closed</description>

              <p><a class="mention" href="/u/mapu">@Mapu</a>: you are not the only one who is banned without reason from <span class="hashtag">#rscdev</span>/securitychat. Mine: “STFU”. I guess I idled too long? I run Pidgin IM…</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/xent">@xEnt</a>: The underlining goal of an alliance is to promote good will, keep administrators in contact, and create an affiliation system to raise google page rank. Can’t keep in contact when there is not a neutral ground and admins are banned with no way to challenge that ban.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tewl">@Tewl</a>: This is a hoax. Tewl is associated with St0rk PK and knows that the server will never have a good name so long as he is known to be running it. Now that Aeros has admitted to the botnet and DDoSing other servers, it is time we take down that botnet, disassemble their client downloader, locate the trojan that it downloads, report them to 1&amp;1 hosting, and have St0rk PK taken down. The probability that female family members of his could connect to a Ventrillo chat on his password protected computer is doubtful at best. Notification of his game server members during an emotional crisis a priority? No. Furthermore, having toyed with this option as a way to get out of leading a clan during a stressful time, this is the first option that comes to mind.</p>
<p>The jokes up. Its time we shut them down and go back to developing, DDoS free.</p>

<p>He tried a month or 2 ago. He’d have no reason to do it unless he’s trying to hide the RSC advertisements. But I doubt he’s doing it, he’s the type of person who needs to know what’s going on.</p>

From what I understand, Tewl hasn’t tried to DDoS you yet, because you have a maximum of 10 members. I’m not starting shit, I’m just telling you what’s up.</p>

I guarantee that’s what Tewl/who ever else who DDoSes will laugh at this and think the same way I am.</p>

              <p>[s]In the face of Jagex with the possible resurgence of RSC and the constant DDoS attacks that have been made against our many RSC private servers, I believe an actual alliance could greatly benefit the mature private servers. Furthermore, wether or not DDoS attacks are a problem, I believe we could each mutually benefit through the use of an affiliate system to help grow our Google Page Ranks. We could call this RSC Alliance.</p>
<p>*]Servers that have been online and public for at least three months would be eligible for joining the alliance<br>
*]The owners of each server would be requested to use MSN messenger and share their MSN name with the other private server owners to provide a direct line of communication in the event of a crisis. MSN is a middle ground, whereas IRC could be monopolized by the chatroom owner.<br>
*]Each member of the alliance would need to have a special area in view of the public on their website where a logo (supplied by each server owner) with a corresponding hyperlink on the image, for each alliance member’s server, can be displayed. This needs to be in a Googlebot-indexable location.<br>
*]Members of the alliance would hereby agree to:</p>
<p>1.) No member shall advertise on each others private servers via spam or attack posts and condemn any rogue attempts made by third parties.<br>
2.) No member shall preform, aid, support, request, or ask to cause a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS attack) another alliance member’s RSC private server.<br>
3.) Any server that is a part of the alliance and that is under a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS attack) with a clear, proven attacker, shall come to the aid of that server and either:<br>
a.) engage in a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS attack) against the attacker OR<br>
b.) help in reporting the attacker to their ISP for the malicious activity.</p>
<p>*]Each member of the alliance may vote upon the application of a server requesting entrance to the RSC Alliance.<br>
*]All official alliance communication shall be held on the <a href="http://Moparscape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> RSC section(s) middle ground.<br>
*]Only one pre-designated Moparscape forum user name may be used to speak on behalf of each alliance member.<br>
*]In the event of a disagreement between two alliance members, a topic shall be created and each alliance member may be granted one official vote.</p>
<p>RSC Alliance members:<br>
DARScape - username: darscape<br>
RscR - username: Anc13nts253, Adu</p>
<p>If your server meets the requirements listed above and you wish to join this alliance, please post in the topic below. All spam posts will be requested to be deleted by a moderator.</p>
<p>Affilate page example:<br>
<a href="http://darscape.org/index.php?show=affiliates" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://darscape.org/index.php?show=affiliates</a>[/s]</p>
<p>Yeay, nobody cares. /closed</p>
