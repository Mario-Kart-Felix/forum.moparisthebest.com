    <title>[Help]Changing the Prayer drain rate</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-changing-the-prayer-drain-rate/337927</link>
    <description>When i have prayer on, it drains way to fast, as long as someone gives me the peice of code where i am to change the time intervals between each decrease in prayer, i can do it easily. I have tried searching drain, and it comes up with non relevant ideas.

Im not sure if i need to even add a completely new prayer system into the server, but im pretty sure it only requires a specific change in seconds.

Appreciate the help.
