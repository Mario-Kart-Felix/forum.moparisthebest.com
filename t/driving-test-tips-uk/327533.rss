    <description>My test is in 3 days now, and the nerves are starting to set in. I took two mock tests today and failed both of them with 1 major in each. What would be appreciated is to find out why anyone on here failed specifically. My two majors were clipping a kurb, and misleading signal when getting back in to a lane. Two mistakes I wont make again. I have 4 hours worth of lessons left, and an hour or two in my own car. 

Gargh  :confused:</description>

<p>In the DART test here (from L’s to provisional) it states you have to check left for pedestrians or cyclist.<br>
So fucking gay.<br>
Anyone who steps or rides out in front of a car deserves to be hit.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Are you sure? I don’t recall such a requirement. Obviously when taking off from the curb we have to look in our right side mirror to make sure there’s a big enough gap, followed by a check of our back right blind spot. Nobody ever made any mention of checking the left side to me, and I never lost marks for it when I sat the test a few years ago.[/quote]<br>
I think It’s in the handbook somewhere. You have to check left and right before taking off from a traffic light too in case of pedestrians.</p>
<p>Maybe It’s just new? Like the new rule of indicating left before exiting a round about. Which I think is just stupid and pointless seeing as It’s like flashing for 2 seconds.</p>
<p>But apparently you lose points by not doing it.</p>

Where I am you don’t even leave the parking lot lol, bout a 5 min test.<br>

Jeez. Our testing is quite rigorous. It involves demonstration of rather trivial (yet trying for a nervous person) maneuver such as reverse parking, U-turns and 3 point turns, along with other skills such as merging, overtaking, safe navigation of roundabouts, maintenance of legal speed, obedience of road rules and signage, etc. The test here takes about 45 minutes, but potentially more depending on traffic conditions.[/quote]<br>
pretty much same here just no roundabouts</p>

<p>unlucky mate. Yeh, they fail u for the stupidest things. Go ahead and book a test for whenever u can, but check every day to see if any cancellations appear. I was lucky and got one straight away. Bear in my mind that the request a 10 working day break in between each test.</p>
<p>Best time to check is Friday at 5:50pm - They put big chunks of cancellations on at that time!!</p>

<p>Apparently the biggest thing people fail on is mirrors… As long as u keep checking em you got a good chance of passing.</p>
<p>My dad had a pupil couple weeks ago where she did the whole test and she woulda passed… She got 200yards from the testing station and stopped in the wrong place and they failed her for a major.</p>
<p>found something out about my dad too… apparently hes one of the best driving instructors in the whole of the UK for Bill plant and IS the best in my area. Ha nice.</p>

<p>I have a pretty good instructor who pretty much has a go at you for not checking mirrors. Just at the roundabout, I got all panicky cos I had to go round again, and completely lost all thought and just focussed about getting the fuck off the roundabout.</p>
<p>Next test is in 10 days (fucking lucky to get another one), and cant bare to not pass a second time…</p>

Lol. I don’t know how roundabouts work there, but I’m going to presume that they’re the same.<br>
With that said, what can you do to change the eventuality of someone’s stupidity (ie, by looking in your mirrors) when exiting one?<br>
The scenario that comes to mind is someone in the outer lane trying to go right instead of left, or straight forward (or, in the case of America, I guess someone on the outer lane trying to go left instead of straight forward or right?). But if they’re going to crash into you at that stage, they’re going to crash into you. If you break heavily to avert crashing into them then odds are someone will rear end you anyway.<br>

<p>If its the first exit? Why go into the inside lane ?</p>
<p>My dad was saying last night that the way he teaches his pupils has got him a 100% pass rate.</p>
<p>Last year he got 100% pass rate (first time passes) and this year he just needs 2 more people to pass and he will have 100% for this year just gone too. which is unheard of in my area <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

              <p>You check your mirrors when exiting a roundabout for people who are in the wrong lane. Primarily it’s when you turn right - if you’re in the right hand lane going round the roundabout, about to turn off on say the third exit (so the right turn from your original position) you need to cut accross the left hand lane - which should be empty if people have been giving way correctly. However occasionally you get the odd dickhead who snook up on you, and if you weren’t to look into your left mirror a collision would be difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>Obviously if you do look in your mirror, you see them and just continue back round the roundabout or pomp like a motherfucker collide and get a fat insurance claim.</p>
<p>That may be difficult to understand but the reasoning behind mirrors is justified, it’s just when you pass your test you’ll probably forget about all of them except the centre <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Remember, you don’t learn to drive, you learn to pass the test. You’ll only learn to drive after you’ve passed and get out there on your own and experience driving.</p>

Lol. I don’t know how roundabouts work there, but I’m going to presume that they’re the same.<br>
With that said, what can you do to change the eventuality of someone’s stupidity (ie, by looking in your mirrors) when exiting one?<br>
The scenario that comes to mind is someone in the outer lane trying to go right instead of left, or straight forward (or, in the case of America, I guess someone on the outer lane trying to go left instead of straight forward or right?). But if they’re going to crash into you at that stage, they’re going to crash into you. If you break heavily to avert crashing into them then odds are someone will rear end you anyway.<br>

<p>I was thinking something along the lines of this:<br>

Where someone is in the wrong lane and would hit you as you exit, if you check the mirror and see the car coming you could continue instead of exiting the roundabout.[/quote]<br>
I never considered continuing right around the roundabout as a method of accident avoidance. That’s quite a good point. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
