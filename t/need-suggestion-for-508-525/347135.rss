    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-suggestion-for-508-525/347135</link>
    <description>I need some suggestion on what to add on my 508/525.
I added full woodcutting and full mining with requirments for my v.2.
I need some other suggestion on what to add.
Please dont say turmoil or anything because im not that of an expert to add it.
If you dont know what 508/525, its 517 or z508.</description>
