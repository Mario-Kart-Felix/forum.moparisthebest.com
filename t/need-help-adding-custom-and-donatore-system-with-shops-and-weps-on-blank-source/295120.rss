              <p>Lol Here I Will Post My More Deeper Tut Of Models XD<br>
Ok If You Was Adding A Death Cape Or Somethin To Your Server You Would Need To Also Add It To Your Client<br>
When You Get The Model(s) For The Item You Add Them Into The Models Folder On Your Client.<br>
Then Once You Have The Ints You Add That Into Class8.java<br>
Once That Is Done You Comiple.<br>
Then Run Your Client And Once Logged Onto Your Server You Need To Say<br>
“Add model (model number)”<br>
Then Restart Your Client<br>
Once Restarted Do :: pickup (item number) And You Should Have It In Your Hand…<br>
But Your Not Done Yet…<br>
Turnoff Your Server And Open Your Server/Source Files<br>
Go Into item.java And If You Had A Cape That You Was Adding To Your Server You Would Get The Item Number And Add It Under “public static int capes”<br>
If You Have A Item4.java File Like I Do Then Do The Same There<br>
Once Done Then Simply Compile<br>
Run Your Server And Client And It Should Be On There Succesfully In The Right Equip Spot<br>
Hope This Helps (Since It Took Me 5 Mins XD)<br>
Oh And If Anyone Thinks I Missed Anything Then Let Me Know</p>

When You Have The Model Add It To Your Clients Model File.<br>
Get The Ints And Add That Into Class 8.java Well I Think Its .java I Dunno… XD<br>
Once You Have Done That Go Into Your Source Folder And Find Item.java<br>
And If You Were Adding Some Custom Legs You Would Look For public static int legs And Just Add The Item ID Into That Section <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
