Heatsink for what? The CPU? Because he has one on there.</p>

<p>It is a quality psu it had a 40 dollar mail in rebate which I already recieved. The fan is silent and it works well, I already had done my research on it before buying it.</p>

<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>Could have picked up a bottom mounted case, cable managment: I bought a 600Watt Modular powersupply with cable slevings for $30 you probably spent 40 on that. Did I say cable managment…do you know what I do with cables I dont use and will never use like extra 4 pin connectors and floppy drive connectors…I cut them off (That costs $0). For the people that say IDE is cheaper price wise than SATA they are wrong. I can find the same brand of a dvd drive an  the IDE version is $1 cheaper. A plus for SATA drives is the cable is far smaller and you dont have this wide ass fucking cable that is harddder than shit to hide. I understand though if you already had this drive and were using it to save money, im all about reusing parts as long as they are decent, im about to build another computer and im using a IDE drive from an old one to put money towards were it matters. Im not sure why you got a full atx motherboard; Micro ATX motherboards are cheaper and all you got yourself was more PCI slots you will never use. Anyways overall its pretty good but theres things I would have done different.</p>

<p>ATX because I would have more room. Main reason why, but besides that, no point to it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Wait ATX is bigger than “Micro-ATX” therefore with ATX you have less room. Anyways im just saying usually Micro-ATX boards are about 20-50 dollars cheaper depending on what ATX board you choose. Seeing that yours, I believe, came with onboard video it is about 20 dollars more than an micro-atx board. And if you are taking about more room for connectors and stuff on a standard atx board, go look at my thread, you will see that cable managment is still easy.[/quote]<br>
As in motherboard space wise. And no, it did not come with a onboard video.</p>
