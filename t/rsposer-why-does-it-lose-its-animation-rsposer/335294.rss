    <title>[RSPoser] Why does it lose its animation...? [RSPoser]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsposer-why-does-it-lose-its-animation-rsposer/335294</link>
    <description>Ok, i know you guys probably see me in here often complaining bout rsposer but this time i finally got the models and can finally make custom animations using metaseq by using the masterpalette (made animations for the corp beast :D) but anyways i wanted to finally merge my staff of light with anim data with the kojack model. But i was wondering if there was a way the kojack model wont lose its anim data whenever i make it into a mqo file.

The guy in my last post said you hav to make it a mqov2 file so it wont lose its animations. But when i try to select mqov2, it isnt in bold like the others meaning its un accessable etc. Do i have to make my own kojack animation data, or is there a way i dont have to (which is opening the file into metaseq without it losing all its animations). 

-Thank you for reading
