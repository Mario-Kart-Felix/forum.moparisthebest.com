    <title>My descriptive essay</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-descriptive-essay/25203</link>
    <description>I threw this together in an hour or two, but it actually turned out fairly nice.  You can see where i tried to be descriptive in the beginning, but gave up at the end and just wanted to finish.  This was written last week for my english class.  I was given a photo of a huge city with numerous skyscrapers, and I had to make that the focal point of my essay. Its ok if you dont want to read it, im just posting it up here for the hell of it.

and sorry about attatching it, its just way too long to post.
its 4 pages double spaced, which is 2 pages single spaced.

It is titled &quot;The ninjas that rebelled&quot;. :P</description>
