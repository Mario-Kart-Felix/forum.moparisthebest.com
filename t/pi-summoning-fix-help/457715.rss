    <title>PI Summoning Fix [Help]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-summoning-fix-help/457715</link>
    <description>OK, I am using Hybrid PvP (which is PI based) I added Summoning Familiars, which are pretty much NPCs made to follow you. (So they don&#39;t attack you&#39;re opponent)

Then I made specials, by using scrolls on npc, w/npc summoned, but I want to add correct Gfx for Steel titan Spec

Here is what I have for Steel Titan Spec (I want the gfx 1449 to damage my opponent, and The Steel titan to use gfx 1443, and my character to use gfx 1311)

IF you could even help me with one of these, it would be appreciated, (i forgot my other forum user&#39;s password) so i cannot Rep++, but help or link to help would be much appreciated

Plus, lastsummon doesn&#39;t work, but if you have a code with lastsummon, I can work my way around it aswell  :)

Please no hate.</description>
