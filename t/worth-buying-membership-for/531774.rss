    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/worth-buying-membership-for/531774</link>
    <description>Without judging RS based on its previous revisions, is it worth paying the monthly fee for? Is the community still garbage? I kind of want to see if it&#39;s worth checking out and getting back into, but I don&#39;t feel like joining and then finding out the community does not exist, bots have infested everything, and the game just has a lack of enjoyment when playing.</description>

<p>Thanks, I’ll have to look into it more now. Is combat boring or something? I mean all of the skills are kind of a grind but I know they added a bunch of ways to skill now so it seems easier/less monotonous for at least some skills. I haven’t really played since the release of EoC so I am not really used to anything but like FM, which I am at like 98 lol<br>

<p>It is a lot less boring than the old combat system imo. You actually have to pay attention and use the abilities that are available to you based on what combat style you’re using and what type of weapon you’re wielding. Abilities have level restrictions, but majority of them are under level 70.[/quote]<br>
Hmm okay thanks :). Hate to admit this but I think I might end up with a new game to play x.x <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
