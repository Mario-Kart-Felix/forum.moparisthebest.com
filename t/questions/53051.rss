          <blockquote>
              <p>how hard is it? - Real easy to run the server just a little knowledge of java is helpful &amp; if you just want to play its even easier.</p>
<p>how much downloading is there? - You only need to download a client to play (Moparscape) if you want to host your own server you need to download a base source.</p>
<p>what am i able to do? - If you are playing on someone elses server you may be limited to only training but if you host your own there is no limit.</p>
<p>can i get any item and any level and keep them if i got to a normal world (members)? - if you mean make an acc on a private server &amp; get items then go onto normal rs the answer is no.</p>
