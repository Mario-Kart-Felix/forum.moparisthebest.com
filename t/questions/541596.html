        <p>I just want to start a new subject. I was browsing around and I came up with many questions. Myself, I’ve been in RSPS development for more than 5 years. That being said, I see some 10 years old lazy kids who just take that ‘pi’, that ugly galkon client and make thousands of dollars. So I’m pretty sick of spending my time when some small kids are making their bank. I’ve heard so many rumours around SS, Ikov, Arrav. That they are making aprox from 10k to 100k per month. Is that true? Anyway here are my questions:</p>
<p>Why people play RSPS?</p>
<p>Why people pay for items on a RSPS?</p>
<p>How to start a great server?</p>
<p>How much to invest to a server’s first month?</p>
<p>Where to advertise your server?</p>
<p>What is the best client data revision?</p>
<p>Any unique features/ideas?</p>
<p>How to block against Jagex?</p>
<p>How can we improve RSPS’s?</p>
<p>Those questions are pretty much random. I am also sorry for bad English grammar and bad sentences structure. I am very tired and going sleep now. I just want to start a conversation. This way, I won’t be bored at school tomorrow as I will read your comments.</p>

        <blockquote>Why people play RSPS?</blockquote>
People play RSPS because they either want to stimulate the RuneScape experience at an easier rate or to relive past experiences such as oldschool servers.
<blockquote>Why people pay for items on a RSPS?</blockquote>
Because they either want to have an advantage on other players or want to support the server. Both is possible as well.
<blockquote>How to start a great server?</blockquote>
To start a great server, you need great content that appeals to people.
<blockquote>How much to invest to a server's first month?</blockquote>
In the very first month of hosting a server, unless you have massive hype, you shouldn't spend any money. The only reason you should spend money for your server is if it gets popular enough that you would have to hold up a big playerbase or lots of data.
<blockquote>Where to advertise your server?</blockquote>
Any place where it wouldn't be considered spam.
<blockquote>What is the best client data revision?</blockquote>
This can't be answered. 317(afaik) is the most documented. Go with whatever your favorite is.
<blockquote>Any unique features/ideas?</blockquote>
Yes.
<blockquote>How to block against Jagex?</blockquote>
Jagex won't touch your server unless it becomes very, very popular. I have not been to this point, so I can't answer fully.
<blockquote>How can we improve RSPS's?</blockquote>
By not downloading a source and hosting it. We should try to innovate the source to the best of our abilities. And after that point it should still be only a private thing, like a beta, for example. Once you have things worked out, go public. Rushing is the worst thing you can do for your RSPS, or any game, really.

        <p><span class="bbcode-b">Why people play RSPS?</span><br>
A lot of people play because the current style of runescape isn’t to their liking. Another good portion play for nostalgia. And some play because they like the small community that RSPS’s produce. And others, idk. I hardly play RSPS so can’t say much.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Why people pay for items on a RSPS?</span><br>
Many of reasons. I think one being that it’s easier to pay for the item than to actually get it and it’s also a way to help the server.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">How to start a great server?</span><br>
Write a content-full base with potential to have a thriving economy, while making sure that PvP’ers have something to do. Don’t forget bosses, minigames, and time killers. After a player maxes (only stats not EXP) I’ve noticed that they don’t really go out to kill things, so you need content for them to stay.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">How much to invest to a server’s first month?</span><br>
Depends on your dedication. I’d say no more than $150. That should cover basic advertising (depending where you advertise), VPS cost (1/2 months actually, again depending) and your webhost.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Where to advertise your server?</span><br>
Everywhere that it’d be relevant. I’ve seen RSPS’s advertised on non-RSPS sites a plenty of times (powerbot being one of them)<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">What is the best client data revision?</span><br>
In my opinion? probably 525 - 667.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Any unique features/ideas?</span><br>
Not for you <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">How to block against Jagex?</span><br>
The only realistic way I see you stopping jagex would be offshore hosting, and that would only stop them for so long. You could also try hosting on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">The Deep Web</a><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">How can we improve RSPS’s?</span><br>
Release a stable, easy to use, well documented client and server. PI became popular because it was super easy to just download and host, and it still is that way (well, relatively). A lot of people that release content (things to download, mostly) don’t have that idea in mind. There is a huge portion that will add anti-leeches and remove bits of code to make it so you must actually have some sense of Java to use it (While I don’t think that’s bad, I think it’s turning a small population of people off of RSPS’s).</p>

        <p><span class="bbcode-b">Why people play RSPS?</span><br>
The community, mostly.  At least, for me, that’s true.  I spend a lot more time on the forums of a server than I ever do in game, just because the community is the most appealing aspect of it in my eyes.  Anymore though, most people just want to continue playing their favorite game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Why people pay for items on a RSPS?</span><br>
Most people that did play Runescape as a kid are grown up now, so donations and things are only a benefit.  They more than likely have jobs with income, and investing $20 to help pay for servers costs with a small reward is only a benefit to both parties.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How to start a great server?</span><br>
Get lucky enough to have a community that doesn’t suck and no rollbacks while everyone is getting started and you’re pretty much good to go.  There’s loads of other stuff, but these two are the main reasons so many fail.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How much to invest to a server’s first month?</span><br>
Enough to keep it up, really.  A cheap VPS from a reliable host and a cheap webhost is plenty to get things actually started considering it’s not like you’re hosting a Minecraft server with 100+ players.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Where to advertise your server?</span><br>
Anywhere you can.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What is the best client data revision?</span><br>
Subjective.  I grew up with 459 Runescape, others with 562.  They all have their communities.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Any unique features/ideas?</span><br>
Actually making your own items is good.  In a mature way, though, having 20 flavors of whip is less than appealing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How to block against Jagex?</span><br>
You can’t.  I haven’t seen them go after anyone in a long time, though.  If you want to avoid them just make your own game.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How can we improve RSPS’s?</span><br>
What I just said, you can’t.  Even if we fully emulate Runescape of any era, it still takes too much time, too many people, and too much dedication for anyone in these communities to handle.</p>

        <p>Why people play RSPS?<br>
Most people play RSPS as a fun, less grind-oriented alternative to Jamflex’s garbage pail. The smaller communities within the servers are appealing as well.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Why people pay for items on a RSPS?</span><br>
People pay for items because it is available for purchase. Take a look at <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/13/separating-free-to-play-and-pay-to-win" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How much to invest to a server’s first month?</span><br>
From a business aspect, there is <span class="bbcode-u">usually</span> a 3-month lag between the initial investment and revenue. I’d suggest investing enough to support the operation for the first 3 months without revenue. Attending the question, this is dependant on how well your development is organized. If think you can handle and manage upkeep, payments, and customer issues efficiently, go balls deep and invest as much as you can for more stability and exposure.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Where to advertise your server?</span><br>
It’s not where you advertise but how you advertise. The idea of marketing is to get exposure so advertise anywhere you can for the least amount of money (if you’re on a budget). You could also implement a system to have your current players advertise for you (i.e. vote rewards and things in this general area).</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Any unique features/ideas?</span><br>
I would tell you but, this is a competitive market so…  <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionlessae52.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">How to block against Jagex?</span><br>
To be continued…</p>
<p>How can we improve RSPS’s?<br>
I would like to push for a reputation requirement to post new threads in the downloads section so we can get rid of the garbage sources and clients that have a few shops and npcs moved around with no unique or elaborate content.</p>
