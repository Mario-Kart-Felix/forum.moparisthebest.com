    <title>Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/questions/9580</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone could answer any of my questions. I have done a little research on these topics but I wanted to know more from an experienced user of SCAR. I just learned about scar yesterday so I don&#39;t know a lot. Flame me if you want, I could care less. Just answer the questions. 

1. Can scar only be used on game programs? or could they be used on other programs? Specifically AIM, Internet Explorer or Firefox, and etc.

2. What games/programs does SCAR work on?

3. Where can I get more info on how to create/use some beginner scripts?</description>
