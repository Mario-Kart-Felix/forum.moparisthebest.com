    <description>I have some questions...

1. Is PwnScape available or will Pwnd or someone else kill me?
2. With Project 16 v 4.5 I saw that their were more commands than their were in help.. are most of these safe to keep like they are?
3. Will most of the tut&#39;s work with Project 16?</description>
