[size=18pt][center]The Intro[/center]

Well, I&#39;ve noticed a lot of retards spamming the forums with things such as &quot;o plz kan u fix mi orphand kase&quot;, and they have absolutely no knowledge on how to program.. So, I&#39;m making a development team to end the stupidty that&#39;s occuring on MSCP. This is mainly about making [b]something[/b] that can stop the stupidity occuring.. I&#39;m not fully sure what, but that&#39;s what the development team is for. Seeing how I&#39;m not too good at programming, I will not be leading the development, I&#39;m just starting it. The leader will be decided once the team of programmers are collected.

[size=18pt][center]Requirements[/center]

Seeing how the team will need people who have an ... &quot;Okay&quot; ... knowledge on how to program, it&#39;s obvious you&#39;ll need to know how to program Java/C#, and you should have be exceptionally good in your grammer, and spelling. You should be able to program quite well, and give an example of your knowledge on the spot, randomly if I/any other person asks you. You should be able to spell well, as in NO LEET SPEAK, and so forth. Of course, if you can&#39;t spell too well, the team will have a few people with abilities on how to use perfect grammer and know how to spell correctly. 

If you don&#39;t have the needed knowledge to join, for the love of god.. Don&#39;t bother to apply, you&#39;ll obviously be denied. The majority of people should have a way to contact everyone else in the team for any quick meetings, or anything else important that could happen at any random moment of time. Though you don&#39;t need to be on for twenty-four hours a day, it would be excellent if you would be able to be active for the majority of the day incase of any meetings that can occur.

[size=15pt][center]Questions about the Requirements[/center]

[B]• I don&#39;t speak much english, but I can program really well.. May I still join?[/B]
[U] Of course, the team is looking for people with good english skills to fix your spelling mistakes, aslong as you can program (OR know how to spell correctly, and use proper grammer) you can join.[/U]

[B]• I have a great knowledge on how to program, and I can spell great.. But I&#39;m not joining unless I can be the leader of the development.[/B]
[U]Well, fuck you.[/U]

[B]• I can&#39;t be on too long, but I want to join anyways.. I have a great knowledge of how to program/I am always able to spell correctly, and that sort of stuff. Can I still join?[/B]
[U]Of course, aslong as you&#39;ll be able to stay on for a minimum of 30 minutes (Preferably longer, but 30 minutes is fine) a day, you can join.[/U]

[B]• I live in a different country, but I can program well. I won&#39;t be able to be on MSN/MSCP/AIM/Yahoo/Any other way for me to contact you while you&#39;re on.. Can I still join?[/B]
[U]Well, no. BUT, if someone else in the team lives in the same area as you (Country, etc) and you can contact them to find out what&#39;s happening, you can join.[/U]

If you have any other questions, just ask.

[size=18pt][center]Applying[/center]

Well, obviously applying is going to be a bit different.. No, there will not be any templates.. But yes, you need a way to prove that you&#39;re a great programmer. I&#39;d honestly prefer that you posted a way for us to contact you besides PM&#39;ing you, a short name we can call you (So we don&#39;t have to call you by something like ohiamthebestprogrammerandifyoudonotcallmebythisnameIwillhuntyoudownandrapeyou).. Then an example of what you can program, and a definition on what it does. No, I do not want anything random such as a method that gives a Private Server item, I&#39;m looking for real java to show you can program.

If you&#39;re applying to fix any bits of grammer, or spelling mistakes.. I pretty much need everything from what I just typed out, but instead of a piece of code, I&#39;d prefer that you have someone that can back you up, saying that you know proper English. (Yes, I know this is insanely shitty proof.. But it&#39;s the best I can think of).

[size=18pt][center]The conclusion[/center]

Well, pretty much that&#39;s all you need to know about this development team. If you have any questions, read the &quot;Requirement Questions&quot;, and/or the FAQ. If your question isn&#39;t there (And it most likely won&#39;t), feel free to post your question on this topic.

[size=15pt][center]Frequently Asked Questions[/center]

[B]• I want to help, but I&#39;m not good at English, and not too good at Programming.[/B]
[U]Well, you can always try to keep the topic clean from any spam, and hope the team best of luck.[/U]

[B]• Oh, this isn&#39;t a &quot;Private Server&quot; development team! I&#39;m going to report you[/B] [B][U]-Not a question[/U][/B]
[U]I don&#39;t give a crap? It&#39;s a development team.[/U]

[B]• What EXACTLY is this team going to do?[/B]
[U]It&#39;s going to create SOMETHING, created by Java that is going to help the morons learn to program before they ask. It may not be made of java, and it may just be discussing with the staff to get them to agree with whatever we&#39;re trying to get them agree with. But it WILL stop the morons from asking dumbshit questions like these.[/U]
