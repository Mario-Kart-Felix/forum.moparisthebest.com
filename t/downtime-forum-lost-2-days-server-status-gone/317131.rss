    <title>Downtime, forum lost 2 days, server status gone</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/downtime-forum-lost-2-days-server-status-gone/317131</link>
    <description>At about 9pm EST time on 12-01-2009 one of the hard drives in my server ceased to function.  This shut everything down and the data on the hard drive is not recoverable.  This hard drive held the entire mysql database.  The people at the datacenter had to put in 2 new drives, reinstall my operating system, and hook the other old drive up so I could grab files from it.  So since 7am or so this morning I have been reinstalling and reconfiguring all the software on the entire server, as well as restoring the latest backup I had of all the databases (from may) and the latest backup I had of the forum (11-29-2009).  I believe it is all done, but there is no way to recover any servers or anything else besides what we have now.  Just repost them.

Thanks for understanding.</description>
