Well me and my brother bought this &#39;96 mustang for $1700. We have got it running. Today we went and got a diagnostics on it, we need to figure out why the battery connection is loose and the pressure release valve is clogged. Some things we are going to do in the future is paint the mustang a burnt orange color, and get some 5 spoke mustang racing rims that are painted orange in the inside and are chrome on the outside. After that we will probably start upgrading the actual motor etc.</description>

<p>Well me and my brother bought this '96 mustang for $1700. We have got it running. Today we went and got a diagnostics on it, we need to figure out why the battery connection is loose and the pressure release valve is clogged. Some things we are going to do in the future is paint the mustang a burnt orange color, and get some 5 spoke mustang racing rims that are painted orange in the inside and are chrome on the outside. After that we will probably start upgrading the actual motor etc.</p>
