    <title>A few questions... Barrows, Barrow effects, ::starter, prayer, castlewars</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-barrows-barrow-effects-starter-prayer-castlewars/183883</link>
    <description>Well I need a few questions answered:

How do I add a barrows minigame, or spawn monsters so that they are PERM in the places i need...
How do I make guthans, karils, ahrims, veracs, and torags effects work... (dharoks already does)
How do I make a ::starter command, and make it work...
How do I make Prayer work... (mainly protect from combats)
How would I go about making a castlewars minigame... (coding it myself) The doors dont open, that needs fixed, and what would I do for flag, to make it equippable, and make it remove weapon, and make it stand up in stand...

Also, if you want to give me codes for any of the above PLEASE POST THEM!
And if you can, tell me WHERE to post the codes in my client.java

Thanks,
     HBG</description>
