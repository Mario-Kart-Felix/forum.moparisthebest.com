    <title>Replacing stalls</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/replacing-stalls/519470</link>
    <description>As you might know, many servers have stalls at home to set people off and/or to make money. Well I&#39;m going bored of this, so I thought why not have something like the stalls that also alternatively gains a level, for instance mining a rock that gives random gems. Another one would be a tree giving what ever... so yeah tell me what your idea is! 

Oh yeah, and don&#39;t come on here saying, you don&#39;t need any of that just delete it all and use primary skills. I can do that, but I don&#39;t want to. Why? because I can just add a counter (as to how many times a rock can be mined or something).

-Thanks.</description>

The problems with suggestions such as those are they are too complex, in development and actual game-play.</p>
