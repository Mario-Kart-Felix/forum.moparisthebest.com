    <description>Hey, so I seen this somewhere else about moderators badges and I thought to myself, why not add a few other badges?

I realise that there are a lot of badges for mopar users, but only 3 or 4 of them get used on moparscape, so why not utilize more of them? 

For example, the web developer one could be brought in, I think that&#39;d be a good addition so that people could recognize the website developers from the Java programmers. I believe a few could be made for moderators, for example, sectional moderators can get one so that they actually stand out from the community other than when they&#39;re posting in their categories/boards. I also believe one for just a general programmer could be brought out, for someone who knows a lot of languages, they don&#39;t generally have to be a guru in that language, but good enough to show they know the language well.

As an addition to the moderators badges, I think they should get a name colour too so that they stand out from the rest of the users where it shows the users online. Since the community members have it, I think the mods should too.</description>

<p>I know you have the badge for website development, the onix one ;). Although, I didn’t realise it was able to be earned on MoparScape. I thought it was just a mitb award?<br>

<p>I was confused on this due to the topic on MoparScape awards, my bad.</p>
