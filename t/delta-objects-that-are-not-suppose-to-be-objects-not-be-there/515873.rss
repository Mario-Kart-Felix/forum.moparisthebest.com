    <title>[Delta]objects that are not suppose to be objects/not be there?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-objects-that-are-not-suppose-to-be-objects-not-be-there/515873</link>
    <description>I been working on remaking lumby, yet I get so mad because there are random spots of godwars objects around my server, along with some other items like lightsaber.  I spent +2hr looking around my client for the models and nothing.  I deleted all the anims besides the godsword stance and nothing.  Btw I deleted the lightsaber model, yet it still shows up. The godwars objects act like random ground spots, fences, and some gates. I have no clue what to do and would like some help out..thanks</description>
