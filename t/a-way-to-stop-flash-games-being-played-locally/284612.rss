    <title>A way to stop flash games being played locally</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-way-to-stop-flash-games-being-played-locally/284612</link>
    <description>Well at work we have a constant issue with people playing flash games locally on  the machine, last year i was on the other side playing the games and now i&#39;ve got to help prevent it. We&#39;ve blocked all web flash applications and have got a whitelist setup for that so that certain websites with flash can still be used. But does anyone here know how to stop flash games being played locally? We need to keep flash player on there because one of IT units revolves around making a flash presentation but not flash games. So any ideas?</description>

I don’t suppose they would let you install linux on the machines would they?  Because using an OS with proper permissions would allow you to do this.<br>

<p>Uh what, how would you do this on Linux?[/quote]</p>
<p>Linux magically fixes the problem.</p>

i work as a part time school IT technician so its students we’re dealing with, and the real issue is to distinguish from a legitiamte flash file for a the coursework and a game that someone has either made/imported to the school.

Are the students suppose to make their own flash files for school work?<br>
I doubt there is anyway to automatic see the difference of a game and something that is not a game.<br>
But is there any problem, if the students more wants to play flash games than doing school work it affect their grade and has to take the consequences.</p>

If it is company computers and company time, you can log whatever the fuck you want.</p>

<p>I don’t know where you got the idea that employees have rights to privacy while on company computers.<br>
A company is perfectly allowed to monitor what their employees do on company computers, they just have to inform the employees they are doing it and what data is collected.</p>

How legal is your way?<br>
If you log people like that I think you could get some problems, but if it is legal it is a great idea.</p>
<p>But if you can in some way to check where the files came from you could block out unwanted do I think.</p>

              <p>but the issue is people dont follow the rules so i need a way to make a block, at least the block prevents them for a while and then when they beat it we create a new block and so on. So far we have eliminated all the online flash player games they just cant play them now</p>

              <p>Well at work we have a constant issue with people playing flash games locally on  the machine, last year i was on the other side playing the games and now i’ve got to help prevent it. We’ve blocked all web flash applications and have got a whitelist setup for that so that certain websites with flash can still be used. But does anyone here know how to stop flash games being played locally? We need to keep flash player on there because one of IT units revolves around making a flash presentation but not flash games. So any ideas?</p>
