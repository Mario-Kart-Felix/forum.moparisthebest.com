    <title>Drop Timer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drop-timer/325064</link>
    <description>First of all, I&#39;m not 100% sure where exactly this post should be...

So, I was really wondering if you can place a timer for 60 seconds from login (one minute) so that the person can&#39;t pickup items

For example:

Two people try to duplicate an item with the pvp trick player 1 kills player 2 and player 2 x-logs.

They log back in, but can&#39;t pickup the looted items because of the drop timer. (one minute)

And the other question that I have is, is it possible to set it so that only the person that killed the other person can get the drop.
(So they can&#39;t simply bring a friend to loot the items)

Helping would be MUCH appreciated, though I have no money or anything to award you with, I would really love some help.

              <p>Sounds like the problem jagex had with the “76k Trick.”</p>
<p>As for this timer, I have no idea, and would more than likely be a pain to add.</p>
