    <title>2 FATAL Programs Made By Me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-fatal-programs-made-by-me/447379</link>
    <description>I am just releasing these programs and in NO WAY be held accountable for anything that goes wrong with your computer/internet or just anything of yours in any way.

I was bored today so i went on to my friend notepad and made 2 .bat files i will be releasing.

!!!!!!!!!!READ THE DISCLAIMER AT TOP AND BEFORE EACH DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!

The first .bat i made will crash your computer

I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT GOES WRONG WITH YOU OR YOUR BELONGINGS/ELECTRONICS

[url=http://up.ht/LU2mqP]Download crash.bat.bat @ UppIT[/url]



The second .bat i made is the Destroyer... If you have some files on your computer and someone is trying to get them and you want them deleted at any cost? Run this program, it will first lock you out of your computer, second remove your system 32 file which your comp needs to run, THERE IS NO RESTORING THE COMPUTER YOU WILL HAVE TO GET A NEW ONE

DOWNLOAD THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DOWNLOAD IN ANYWAY IT MAY EFFECT THE PERSON WHO RUNS IT

this first link is the safe version (right click it, edit, i put the word anti scattered around it just in case so anywhere you see the word anti, even if it is connected to another word delete JUST ANTI:

[url=http://up.ht/LU2VRB]Download break.bat @ UppIT[/url]

the second link(hot link once its downloaded it is ready to go, no messing around):

NOT SAFE [url=http://up.ht/LU3lYf]Download break.bat @ UppIT[/url] NOT SAFE 


as i keep saying again and again i will not be held responsible for anything that you do with these files


I do not know why i released these, i was just bored :P but there are the files, go by the way of the disclaimer

message me for info, DO NOT message me if you opened these files as i said many many times i am not responsible

For the love of god only open under dire circumstances

For the last time i am not responsible for the downloading of these files, once they reach your computer it goes into your own hands.

1 more thing, no re-releasing without notice that it will break their computer if they run it, make sure you yourself add disclaimers and MANY MANY WARNINGS

well mopar community there you go, these files are untested because as you can see i&#39;m still at my computer :)

i believe this to be for just windows 32 bit... i did not remove anything i just added this</description>

<p>Seriously, we do not care about your attempts to “crash computers” or “break” them. We don’t condone any malicious behaviour like this.</p>
<p>This isn’t even programming, it’s just a few silly batch files strung together that takes advantage of the lack of proper permissions on Windows prior to Vista.</p>
