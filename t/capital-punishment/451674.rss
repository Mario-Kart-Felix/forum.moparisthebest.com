    <description>Should criminals that have committed certain crimes be put to death by injection? If so, which crimes would constitute such a punishment?

&lt;blockquote&gt;To add on to this question. Instead of just death by injection, what other types of capital punishment should be allowed? E.g. execution by shooting&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>I have a bit of a mixed opinion about capital punishment. In severe cases that can be proven without a doubt, I support.</p>
<p>The real negative to capitol punishment is its tainted by the stigma of error, racism, and other factors. The reasoning behind it has lost its true meaning. It does not save money as a execution costs millions. It does not give true closure to any of the families, and obviously does not deter future crime by others.</p>

<p>We need to rehabilitate the prisoners and get control of out borders again. (Border control in Europe is weak because of that EU and Schengen shit). People who travel to a country to commit crimes should be sent out of the country and not be allowed in again. (Again an argument that applies to Europe. You should watch out for eastern Europeans ).</p>
<p>Rehabilitating works, it saves money and is the most humane thing to do. But it won’t help if the society won’t take them back. If they can’t get a job, criminal activity is the only logical way for former inmates.</p>

<p>What barbaric country do you live in, that make people sit and do nothing in a room for 20 years. I’m pretty sure such treatment would constitute as torture. Two wrong doesn’t make right. If you think killing someone is unforgivable you would not use that as a penalty. If you think death penalty is OK, you say that some murder is forgiveable and your death penalty argument fall apart.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It just seems like a pretty unfair trade to me - you kill someone, and you are jailed (or let off in this country!). Jails are not like superman’s troll obviously. A lot of shows document the jails, and they do have things to do and meals to eat. They even develop their own communication systems and whatnot. Also, a lot of felons commit more crimes after they are released from jail.</p>
<p>Perhaps it could be up to the victim’s family what would happen to the murderer? Just a thought, and of course by this I mean non-accidental. Some people forgive murder, while other’s want revenge. I guess that’s kind of unfair as well though.</p>

What barbaric country do you live in, that make people sit and do nothing in a room for 20 years. I’m pretty sure such treatment would constitute as torture. Two wrong doesn’t make right. If you think killing someone is unforgivable you would not use that as a penalty. If you think death penalty is OK, you say that some murder is forgiveable and your death penalty argument fall apart.</p>

<p>What? Yeah sure he pulled it out so much the german money wasn’t worth anything. Did you never read in History how he just printed more money?</p>

</aside>
<p>He did much more than just “print money”.</p>
<p>Are you German, or even American by any chance?<br>
[/quote]I am like 10% German. I don’t speak it or anything. I just enjoyed watching the documentaries about the world wars.</p>
<p>I’ve never personally studied/researched actual historical facts over it but from what I have heard about in history class/in the movies Hitler ruined their economy( of course a war destroys any economy but you know what I mean )[/quote]</p>
<p>I ask because there’s generally two versions of history when it comes to the world wars, the American history and the history from the rest of the world. There’s also German history in which they bury their heads in the sand, and the other German history where they criticise damn near everything the Nazis did like they were under some obligation to do.</p>
<p>Hitler didn’t necessarily print money, the Weimar hyperinflation was fixed by introducing a new currency, 10 years before the Nazis got into power, but what Hitler did do was institute government issued notes redeemable 5 years after issuing to kick-start production and get people working, although not Hitler’s or the Nazis idea, the autobahn was built under Nazi rule. Unemployment in Germany went from 6 million to 330k in the span of 6 years.</p>
<p>The economy may have been fucked because of Hitler and the second world war but the economy was fucked after the first world war, during the Weimar hyperinflation it was cheaper to burn paper money instead of coal and a wheel barrel full of one billion mark notes wouldn’t buy a loaf of bread.</p>
