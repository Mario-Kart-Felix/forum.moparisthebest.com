    <description>If someone has developed a server and is ready to get it on a webclient and website but doesnt have the experience in web design to make it look good,
or doesn&#39;t have the cash for a domain,
or would just like help a long the way,
I am willing to help someone with a server for partnership and I&#39;ll buy a domain for the site and design the site myself, all you have to do is set up the webclient and give me the final html code to paste onto the page when done.
We can discuss this and work out ideas for a site,
I havent coded in a while now but I&#39;ve been practicing web design for awhile now and I think if some people pitch some ideas we could come up with something great.

maybe it could be a server listing site, like a portal to different servers webclients, but instead not just a portal to webclients but a portal to  individual sites for each server, and only have servers that deserve it on the listing, I&#39;m talking 3 or 4,

see, its a whole bunch of possibilitys and ideas, we could start a whole team here and come out with something bomb.
I&#39;m the domain purchaser and webdesigner, now i need the team.
