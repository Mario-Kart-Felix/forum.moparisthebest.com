    <description>First off I would like to say that I have no intention of pissing off the members here. I&#39;ve read previous threads in this section and they&#39;re flamed repeatedly with no remorse. I will not lie to you, I&#39;m a shit programmer, I am a noob. With that being said I present my question;

Recently I&#39;ve been working on a 317 source. I suddenly realized something that I hated: when my character stands still, he rocks back and forth. I&#39;m used to them standing at a statue like position. I was wondering if anyone could inform me on how I could remove this.</description>

<p>Otherwise, like they said check configurations, the java files that contain walking and such.</p>

defiantly client sided check it out over there. btw if your a shit programmer try to learn some java before going into making your own server.<br>
[/quote]<br>
This is set server sided as well. I mean, I don’t know if you know this. But most servers have set stand/walk/run/etc anims…</p>
<p>OP: Can you at least tell us the base you’re using?[/quote]<br>
I know but his stand anim that is in his client sided probably has to be changed.</p>
