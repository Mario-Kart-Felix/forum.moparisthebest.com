[/quote]That’s 90% of your posts. Dude, all you say is that. And don’t bring that <code>'This isn't a spoon-feeding community. Read the rules, buddy. When a question is asked repeatedly at least 10 times a day, I think people can find it by searching instead of being lazy.'</code> shit up, atleast try to help, this answer is only asked 2 times a week, the answer is not within 3 pages of Google or the entire list of MoparScape search. So just help or stfu.<br>
[/quote]Telling somebody to use the search bar is helping.[/quote]</p>
<p>He doesn’t need to spam it all over the forum. If Chassy was the owner of moparscape, if you creat a topic in the server help section, there should stand in the size of a 22" screen, USE THE SEARCHBAR…</p>
