[b]Hello, I have decided that the time is right that I finally release my server to the public. I am going to say this off the bat,[u] If you are somebody who cannot handle arguments, getting scammed or cannot control their emotions - this server is NOT for you.[/u][/b]

RareScape is a 317 Czar based server which is all about rare-collecting, and nothing else. This is not a PKing, PVMing or skilling server [b](You NEVER lose your items upon death)[/b]. Although you can do all these things on the server, it is not my primary objective to make the gameplay for these run perfectly smoothly. My objective is to make a game which you have never played before, a game in which you must have an open mind, a strong heart, and a will to be number 1.

[b]I want to warn you all however, that this server is still under heavy construction. But the progress done on RareScape is stable enough and should be fun for all to enjoy. You may encounter bugs throughout your stay, but these bugs shouldn&#39;t hinder your rare-collecting in any way. The server still needs ALOT of work done to it, but as the playerbase grows, so does the server...[/b]
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This is not like any other server you have played before, as you [b]cannot[/b] get banned. Yes that is correct, this is an [b]unmoderated server[/b]. This means that there is no staff on this server, no mods + admins, only players. So basically what I mean by this is that you can scam, flame, troll etc ect etc. You name it, you can do anything and you will recieve no infractions.

[b]You may be thinking, but what if I have a problem or I need to inform the coder that there is a bug on the server?[/b] This is a valid question. You can post your problems on the RareScape wikia (The link is provided on the JFrame) which you can post all your enquiries. You could also ask someone already online. I will be online to help anybody who needs help.

[b]You also may be thinking, So what do you do for the server if you&#39;re not staff?[/b] Another good question. I am nothing but a coder. I listen to everyone&#39;s suggestions as to what you would like me to add to the server. I sort out people&#39;s technical problems and deal with any found bugs. I do not ban people or anything related to that, If someone was to randomly call me a [b]Faggot fudge-face[/b], I wouldn&#39;t do anything, infact I would encourage it. The more fiesty you are, the more it will benefit you.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

RareScape may not have staff, but they do have Donator Ranks. Now listen to this, [u][u][b]I don&#39;t want your money, I don&#39;t want anybody to donate to my server, I don&#39;t need money. I do this for my own satisfaction and I love this server. [/b][/u][/u][b]You do not get the Rank from paying, you get it from playing.[/b] Think of it as you are donating to the game in a way that you are helping the server, as in advertising and just generally helping the server grow. If I see you are a helpful player who has contributed alot to the server, you will be awarded the rank. Please don&#39;t pester me about it, as it will not increase your chances of anything. NOTE: You gain absolutely no game-changing benifits to recieving the status, only the ability to do ::yell, and 3 other commands with no value to them, and a donator icon next to your name.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Now to the main event. What exactly is [b]&quot;rare-collecting&quot;[/b]. I&#39;ll tell you. RareScape is a server in which EVERYTHING is rare, from ashes to dragon longswords, everything has sentimental value to it. Many of you may not grasp this idea immediately. but since PKing is not such an importance, powerful weapons such as godswords wont be as significant as, lets say, an anti-dragon shield. Sure, maybe you can kill monsters quicker with the stronger weapon, but that shouldn&#39;t be your mindset going into this, since you should treat [b]EVERYTHING[/b] as rares. The only way to trade your items is through drop-trade. You can show your items up for trade before drop-trading them but, I cannot stress this enough,[u][b] YOU MUST REMOVE YOUR ITEMS UP FOR TRADE BEFORE DECLINING, OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR ITEMS THAT WERE UP FOR TRADE![/b][/u] Aswell as that, [u][b]SCAMMING IS ALLOWED ON THE SERVER, SO IF YOU GET SCAMMED AND YOU MOAN AND THREATEN ME THAT YOU WILL QUIT, GO AHEAD AND QUIT YOU WONT GET YOUR ITEMS BACK.[/b][/u] There are [b]alot [/b]of customs in this server, [b]if you dislike customs, then tough luck[/b]. The more items = more rare collecting. That being said, the way customs are implimented into the server wont make customs always &quot;in your face&quot; which often deters people.

I could virtually go on forever and ever. It is actually hard for me to withhold so much information to you guys. I love this server, I love it so much I had to share it with others to enjoy what I feel for the server. It is my very first server I made, and will be my only server. I know I have alot of work to do on the server, I know that. I know I am not the greatest coder in the world. I know that. But I feel what I have that nobody else has is passion and commitment. 

Enough rambling on, you can view the media in the spoiler. If you have any questions feel free to ask me below. I wish you all well and hope that I can see you on the server one day!

<p>If you want to try and belittle my work once again I’ll do the same. What junk have you created that has gained 20+ players and can be considered unique in any way? I’ll tell you what, you haven’t. So how about you stop trying to diminish something a server that has proven itself and you make something unique yourself.</p>

<p>I never banned anybody on the server. I got in heated dabates with people when they got scammed but I did not give them any punishment even when the person said that my dad should die of cancer. So I stuck by this. You can say ehatever you want but when somebody replies with stupid I reply stupid.</p>

<p>Nope. You have never seen a server remotely like mine. I want you to provide proof or you’re talking nonsense here. And it didn’t fail it reached 20+ players at all times and in 2015 so again you don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>The server is unique and did not fail. Instead of hating take inspiration. It is unique and we all know it.</p>
<p>Also you contradict yourself by saying the server isnt unique and later say there is no server like it. Sk8r you’re in the wrong here and please stop bumping this…</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment Lil, I can understand your view regarding the scamming side of the server, and unfortunately there is nothing that I can make you feel better about this situation. Scamming is bound to happen, to many players, it is just up to you to find the right player who you deem to be trustworthy in drop-trade transactions.</p>
<p>I hope to see you on the server one day![/quote]</p>

Scamming is bound to happen, to many players, it is just up to you to find the right player who you deem to be trustworthy in drop-trade transactions.</p>
<p>I hope to see you on the server one day!</p>

              <p>Some of the updates that are coming very soon:</p>
<p>-Adding 3 more bosses into the game (each dropping different set of rare items)<br>
-Fixing the noted prayer bones in the starter pack<br>
-Fixing magic max hits to their original maxes<br>
-Adding more stats to the weapons and armour already in the game<br>
-Re-writing the use item on dropped item method<br>
-Fixing minor technical things.</p>
<p>Also: Highscores have been disabled for now. I have discovered a security breach involving the highscores. Until I get this sorted highscores will be disabled.</p>
<p>And again, Thankyou everyone who has decided to play this game. The server’s player base is growing rapidly by the hour. It is really refreshing to see many players adapting to this new style of RSPS.</p>
<p>If anybody has any suggestions about what they want to see in future updates, do <span class="bbcode-b">::suggestion xxxxx </span>(x’s representing your suggestion). I will read all of them and take them into consideration.</p>

Thanks hugh, when I have such a good community it motivates me to make more updates and in general, make rare-collecting more enjoyable.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edit:</span> I have just re-written the whole pickup method for flawless ground pickup. Also as of now, you can check people’s banks by doing ::checkbank xxxx (x’s representing player’s name).</p>
