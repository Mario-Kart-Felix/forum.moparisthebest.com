    <title>Help requested with SRL</title>

    <description>Hi guys, I&#39;d really appreciate any help any of you could offer me.
I&#39;ve been trying to set up the SRL thing in SCAR. I&#39;m using SCAR 3.06 and i used SRL_360_without_Manual.rar.
When I tried to run SetupSRL.scar it gave me this error-

Failed when compiling
Line 26: [Error] (43:1): Duplicate identifier &#39;UpChars&#39; in script C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.06\includes\srl\srl\core\Globals.scar


Prior to this when I freshly installed SCAR and tried to run some Runescape autominers it gave me an error saying-

Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.06\includes\SRL\SRL.Scar does not exist.
Include file C:\Program Files\SCAR 3.06\includes\SRL\SRL\Skill\Mining.Scar does not exist.
Failed when compiling


I&#39;d be really grateful if anyone could help me. :) Thanks.</description>
