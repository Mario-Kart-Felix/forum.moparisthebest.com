    <title>Newbie Needs Help with Graphics. HELP PLEASE :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/newbie-needs-help-with-graphics-help-please/184466</link>
    <description>Hey, I just joined the forums and I&#39;ve always wanted to make sigs and stuff in Graphics because I&#39;ve always liked them.
Gman7, who some of you may know has already made me a sig which kinda influenced me to want to start Graphics. 
Thanks a lot for the sig, I really liked it. It&#39;s my desktop picture =P

Anyways, I have never learned anything about doing Graphics except for a couple of stupid things I did in Paint which suck. 
I downloaded Gimp 2 and I know what TuTs are but I don&#39;t know how to start at all. 

If anyone could help me, my Msn name is Supajin123@hotmail.com and i&#39;ll be on there after I get home from school which is about 3:30 until like 8ish. Weekends I&quot;ll probably be on most of the time.
If anyone can help me get started I&#39;d greatly appreciate it
Thanks</description>

<p>A new window will appear, in this new window note the layer tab, in layers tab, in front of label Layers you can see a small button the left arraw, just click it and go through menus Add Tab and you will be shown a list of tool tabs, you only select Brushes, Patterns, Gradients, Tools, Tool Options.</p>
