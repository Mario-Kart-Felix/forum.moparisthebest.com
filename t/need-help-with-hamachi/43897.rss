              <p>Your not supposed to be able to start your server with compile… Compile is what updates your things after you’ve edited them. After you run Compile and it says press any key to continue just click enter or whatever.</p>
<p>After that Click Run Server and then minimize that &amp; log into your server.</p>
<p>For others to join you they need:</p>
<p>Your Hamachi IP<br>
Your Port (find that when starting your server, say you run on pimpscape - When you run Run Server it’ll say “Started pimpscape on 0.0.0.0:XXXX” or something to that affect. Where the XXXX is is your port. You will need to give out that port.<br>
&amp; for you to keep running your server.</p>
