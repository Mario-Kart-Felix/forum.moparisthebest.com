    <description>I need help getting onto servers with hamachi.

I fill in the Server IP and the password and it just pings it. I&#39;ve clicked browse and still nothing. While doing this I filled in the server IP and port number on MoparScape. I have no clue what I should do next!

I would appreciate if someone could give me instructions on how to get on these servers, since all I know how to get on is the no-ip one&#39;s.[br][size=1]Posted on: June 02, 2007, 12:49:41 PM[/size][hr]BUMP!</description>

<p>Anyway heres what i said to some other guy who asked the same thing.</p>
<p>Here is a simple run through on how it works.</p>
<p>ok, if you look on server advertisement, some servers will need you to have hamachi for you to join the server. look on that thread at the hamachi username (e.g Server 1-10). Now look in the bottom right corner of your hamachi box and look for a triangle with 3 dots symbol, not the the circle one. Click on join existing network and type in the server username and pass. On a thread it could say ( user: Server 1-10 Pass: 123). Make sure you use capital letters and spaces as it is shown. Now look for the owner of the server’s ip and check if the server is online. check you have the right port and you should be able to log on a ham server.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is a bit long and confusing.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
