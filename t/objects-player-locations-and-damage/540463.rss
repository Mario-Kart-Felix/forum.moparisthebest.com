    <description>What methods would be involved in making it so an object ( like in an area where there may be a moving spike or something ) if a player stands so many squares near it damage can occur. 

I have the general idea how this is done my question is more so to how to do it efficiently.</description>

<p>that was pseudo-code</p>
<p>what you could do is have some sort of listener that listens for if the player is a certain distance toward the object once the player enters the region that contains the object</p>

              <p>I know people have done relative object placement by their distance to the object.<br>
but i would split it up farther into regions. instead of absX and absY if you are in region(baseX,baseY) then go through and check the abs Positions. would sub divide all of the logical checks it has to do based on certain regions. and im sure your server has many seperate areas where these things are added. (Such as lumbridge, camelot, edgeville), they are distincly different regions, and the server already has the baseX,baseY on hand, for handling client updating.</p>
