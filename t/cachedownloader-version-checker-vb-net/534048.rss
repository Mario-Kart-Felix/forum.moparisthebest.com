    <description>[size=14pt][b]CacheDownloader &amp; Version checker in VB.NET[/b][/size]


[b]Info:[/b]
First of all, this is not completely finished. Cache unzipping isn&#39;t added yet.
For the rest it should be fully working.
This was meant for learning purposes for myself,
and I hope some people can also learn from this.

[b]What does this do exactly?[/b]
It&#39;s reads the text from a webpage, which should contain the version of your cache.
The persons version is compared to the one from the webpage, so we know if an update is required.
When the person hits the update cache button, it will download the new cache.
When pressing launch, it will (if the cache is up to date) launch your client jar which should be included in the pack.

I&#39;m aware that this is just useless if you are running a webclient because you have to do it in java anyways then.
But it&#39;s great imo as desktop client and this was for learning purposes after all.

[b]Editing:[/b]
[i]Changing the logo:[/i]
- Go into the data folder and simply replace the logo by yours. But keep the name and size the same!

[i]Changing the client to run[/i]
- Go into the data folder and replace the jar by yours, then edit the client.bat and change the name of the jar to yours.

[i]Changing cache download paths etc...[/i]
- Open the project in Visual Studio 2012 or higher.
- There are some lines with constants, which like you will see hold links.
   (The name of the constant should explain good enough what it is.)
- CTRL + F5 to save and see if you made errors and shit.

[i]Setting up the version checking.[/i]
- Go to your website and create a new file where you put in a version number. (1 1.2  3.6 whatever you want)
- Change the link to the version in the project.

[i]Delivering the files for your users.[/i]
- Go into your project folder &gt; ClientHandler &gt; ClientHandler &gt; Debug
- Copy the data folder and the ClientHandler.exe (not the clienthandler.exe named one, that&#39;s an xml) into a new folder.
- Ready to be given to playazz (at least if I would have added unzipping)

Like I said, learning purposes.<br>
I’m learning <a href="http://VB.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">VB.NET</a> and it’s more fun to make something like this than a boring oxo game or some shit</p>
