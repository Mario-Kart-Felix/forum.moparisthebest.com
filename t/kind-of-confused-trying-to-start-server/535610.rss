    <title>Kind of confused, trying to start server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/kind-of-confused-trying-to-start-server/535610</link>
    <description>I know how to program in Java so this step is check
I know how to set up the compiler and bla bla bla

BUT THE ONE KEY ELEMENT

Where do you start?

I keep reading

Project Insanity(PI?) and Delta

What are these names? A framework, some kind of base?

These forums aren&#39;t really updated to often and the stickies are rotting.

So what I ask from you dear runescape players is where can I start? 

I downloaded this https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,469065.0.html

and I&#39;ve played around but I don&#39;t really know any of the methods or really anything? Is there some kind of DOC I can read up on?

I mean I made a script for powerbot and it wasn&#39;t to bad because they had some nice organized docs.

Anyways, if someone could just point me in the right direction I would very much appreciate it!

Thanks!</description>

              <p>Well I mean if you want to start a server the simplest way would be too download a framework from the downloads section (see: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,49.0.html</a>). I’ve been away from the private server area a long time, but I can almost guarantee “PI” and “D” are just names of the base the person used when make their server.</p>
<p>Here’s the usual chain of events here.<br>
a terribly programmed framework is released for x revision -&gt; someone downloads said framework, adds more terribly programmed features -&gt; releases their update version of the original framework, and name it something like “(DELTA)  317!!! FULL SILAB ITEMS!!! NO PSY!!! !!! MUST DOWNLOAD!!!” -&gt; someone downloads said framework -&gt; cycle of life continues.</p>
