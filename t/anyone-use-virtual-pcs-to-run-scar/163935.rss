    <title>Anyone use Virtual PCs to run SCAR?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-use-virtual-pcs-to-run-scar/163935</link>
    <description>Does anyone here use a program like Virtual PC 2007 or VMWare to run multiple SCAR bots? And if you do - how does it work out? I haven&#39;t played RuneScape for years now, but it&#39;s something I just want to mess around with, and see how it works out, because I do remember someone mentioning a long time ago that this could be done.

Thanks!</description>
