    <description>Hey guys, yesterday i was going around my server shops, and taking out items that i felt shouldn&#39;t be in shops. I reached to the point where I didn&#39;t want any items in this shop, so I deleted all items and quantitys out of that shop, but not where it said &quot;Shop  46&quot; just the items

I went to compile it, and the compiler worked fineee. But when i went to run the server, it glitched on me and wouldnt work. I tried undoing what i did, also didnt work.

Any help is grately appreciated, I had a decent server with TONS OF CODING done to it, i dont want it all to go to waste. any help? Source is TORVAPKZ1</description>

              <p>Did the run batch not work?  Or were you unable to login to the server?</p>
<p>Edit:  You deleted the buy and sell numbers.  If you look in your shops.cfg file, you’ll see that every shop has two “2’s” before the “item” and “amount” numbers.  You can’t delete those numbers.  Just put them back in, compile it and it should work.</p>
