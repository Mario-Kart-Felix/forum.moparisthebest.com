    <description>[size=10pt][u][center]ShardBlazer[/center][/u][/size]

[b]Base and Stability:[/b] The server is based off the extremely efficient Shard Revolutions created by Graham. The server has full protection against Syi and googleBot, and there are no null&#39;s, because the login system has been completely re-written. The server has been tested with 200+ bots, all spamming without a crash, and a cpu usage of only 50%.

[b]What will you see?:[/b] The server will be focused around skilling, but with a complete overhaul of Shard&#39;s player vs player. The economy will be at fair prices, and lvling will be at a decent rate, such as about 20-40 xp per hit. The server will feature some form of minigame, hopefully a barrows at least. The skills will be upgraded and new ones released, hopefully including Runecrafting, Crafting, Smithing, Mining, Fletching, Wcing, Fishing, Slayer, and Magic.

[b]What makes this server different?:[/b] ShardBlazer&#39;s main feature is how it will be based of something NOT Deltascape based, and have extremely high stability.

[b]Release Date:[/b] ShardBlazer&#39;s targeted release date is around the middle of may.
