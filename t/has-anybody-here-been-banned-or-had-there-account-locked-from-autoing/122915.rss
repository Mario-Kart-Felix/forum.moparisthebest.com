<p>I fail to see how autoing on a level 3 is ruining the game. Would you rather see level 50-126 people auto instead? I could have swore this site was originally made for designing ways to cheat at runescape, but then people complain about cheating, on the site? I just laughed at all of you.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>As do I.</p>
<p>Think of it, level 3’s are doing us a favour. They keep the prices of rare’s and desired items low, they improve the availability of NEEDED items such as ess, logs, ores, bones, hides, food and people COMPLAIN about them, yet the whole fucking market of things people don’t auto is fucked up, the selling price OF 1 NATURE RUNE has gone up to THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY COINS! Bow strings! 200 GP each! Yew logs sold in low amounts, almost 250 GP each! If you suck at math, that’s 800GP for the cost of a yew longbow(s) and 1 nature rune, damn I remember when all this used to cost little under 700GP, but no. People like to exploit common resources for huge gain, autoers keep to one thing and the prices stay consistent through weeks and weeks of autoing.</p>
<p>To explain this differently, greed wrecks the economy. Sure, someone that owns 50~ level 3’s and autos on 10 at nights and 5 during the day MAY be filthily rich, but think about it, people auto iron, price hasn’t changed in 3 years, people auto coal, slight change during periods, but no more than 50gp either way, and finally, the selling price of 1 steel bar is 600gp. This price has NEVER changed since the 6th of April, 2004, WAY before the update of a 1 px white line around items when you click them. Yet what do people complain about? Autoers in the coal mine, autoers mining iron, but again, you’ll ONLY find the corruption in the sheer numbers looking to exploit fast ways of making money and xp, such as alching again. When I started playing, no more than 2 alchers at seer’s bank, and NONE at the camelot teleport location, yet fucking pures and people willing to make money flock to it. I mean, log on to a members world, do a camelot tele, what do you see? 5-10 alchers. Is it easy? Damn fucking right it is.</p>
<p>If you haven’t figured it out yet, the real hardcore cheaters only make up about 2% of the current playing people at any time. I just loaded <a href="http://RS.com" rel="nofollow noopener">RS.com</a>, 182702 people are playing, about 3654 of them are actually using some form of cheat and are sleeping or whatever.</p>

I could have swore this site was originally made for designing ways to cheat at runescape, but then people complain about cheating, on the site? I just laughed at all of you.</p>
