    <description>I need to make a client that others can download and connect to my server, Not choose an ip and connect to that server. i have a cleint that has all my id&#39;s correct but i want to know how to edit it to connect to my no-ip adress and make it so they cant edit it. (like the ones you download where theirs a run file.)

PS. 1) Please make step by step instructions.

And Replace All Of Them With Your IP Adress Your You <a href="http://No-Ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">No-Ip.com</a> IP Adress… Then Save And Compile…<br>
Right Click On Client File… And Click “add To Archive” Then Uplaod That File To “<a href="http://Mediafire.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Mediafire.com</a>” Or What Ever…<br>
There You Go.</p>
