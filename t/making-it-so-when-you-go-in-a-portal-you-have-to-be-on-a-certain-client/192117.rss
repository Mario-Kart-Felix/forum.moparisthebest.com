    <title>Making it so when you go in a portal, you have to be on a certain client?</title>

    <description>Hi coders,

This is complicated but I want to make a portal which teleports you, to varrock for example.  But you need to be using my client to go.  How can I make it like this? Example;

If a player clicks on the portal using my webclient, it would to varrock.
But if a player is using another client then my webclient it would say: You need to be using the webclient to enter here!

Is this even possible?  Is there a way to do this?  If so, how  :|

Thank you very much for taking the time to read my post!

              <p>I dont know how to do that,<br>
But i do have another idea,<br>
If the player enters the portal,<br>
Set a item on the ground that is onley visible with your client.<br>
Probably make’s him Disconnect or Lagg,<br>
Just when you enter portal,<br>
Let it say the line:<br>
WARNING: Need my client to enter or something.</p>
