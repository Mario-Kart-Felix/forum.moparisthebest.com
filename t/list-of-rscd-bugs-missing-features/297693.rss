    <title>List of RSCD Bugs/Missing features</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/list-of-rscd-bugs-missing-features/297693</link>
    <description>With the help of the community for RSCAngel, over the past 6 months they have helped tally up the missing [b]F2P[/b] content, and bugs.

Since RSCAngel is a F2P (free version) replicate in progress, of RSC. this list does not contain any P2P stuff, it will contain both full F2P, and shared features/bugs between f2p/p2p

Note: this is not everything, i&#39;m sure theres still bugs/missing features F2P out there that i haven&#39;t got to yet, but heres a nice list of what RSCDaemon lacks (from the original)





[b]-----RSCD bugs------[/b]

huge RSCD memory leak (hint, Tile[][])
fix the dupes that are around (forgot which ones)
fix &#39;autocatching&#39;/auto following them after a wildy fight.
fix beers, to only go -1 atk level. wine 3
allow 2 people to mine and get ore at the same time, if they mine before the rock goes empty
Fix rarely when walking to NPC&#39;s or an object it would just stand there, and not execute what it was going to do

<p>That’s not the RSCD bug, the RSCD bug is where you can stop prayer draining due to the way prayer was coded. To fix it you have to recode some stuff, which I can’t remember as it was ages ago when I did it. But after that you then need to reduce the rate by 20%</p>
