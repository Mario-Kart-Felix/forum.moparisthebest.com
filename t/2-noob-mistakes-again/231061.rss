    <title>2 noob mistakes again :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-noob-mistakes-again/231061</link>
    <description>Hi,

I&#39;ve been trying to add safezones and yet again i&#39;ve made a mistake somewhere.
Here is what i&#39;ve added:

[code]                || (absX &gt;= 2292 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2251 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= 4676 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 4717)[/code]
That includes the indents and everything, but It is failing to make that area safe. It remains wild.
I did this in the format:
[code]                || (absX &gt;= SWx &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= NWx &amp;&amp; absY &gt;= SWy &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= NWy)[/code]

Also, I have changed the spawn points of the shopkeepers into a new place, which is also being silly and being wild. However, I cannot access the shops as I lagg and I am disconnected when I talk to or trade with any of them.
This was not a problem when they were in a safe-zone.

I think that they need to be in a safezone or something for me to not get disconnected, but I can&#39;t do that without the safezone code to work.

I haven&#39;t got the slightest idea about what is wrong with the safezone code though.
Sorry!

Thanks, hope someone can help,
