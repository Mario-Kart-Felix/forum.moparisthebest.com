    <title>A rollback of a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-rollback-of-a-server/438979</link>
    <description>hey everyone i was just wondering if you might have some answers.

Scenario: Server is online and a character gets kicked then when they logg back on the find that items they have got in the last 10 minutes are no longer there or if they trade items to another character they now have the items on both characters.

Question: What causes this to happen because there is no errors. Easyrsc.</description>

From there you should be asking yourself</p>
<p>Did I ::kick the player<br>
Did the server shut down?<br>
Did I shut down the server?<br>
Was everyone logged off?</p>
<p>Idk what the issue is but when you said kick, I thought of the command. Needs more detail.</p>

I understand that , but the actual question I was trying to ask was what causes the server to do it.  I didnt state it clear before, but i think it is from no junk dumping and it overloads the server which causes it to lagg and random rollbacks.</p>

<p>It’s not like there are many skilled people left… it’s good that someone who isn’t Kryptix or Jagex is at least trying to host a RSC server.</p>
