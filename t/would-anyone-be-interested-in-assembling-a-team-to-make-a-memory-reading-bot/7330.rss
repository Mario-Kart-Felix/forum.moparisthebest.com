    <title>Would anyone be interested in assembling a team to make a memory reading bot</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-anyone-be-interested-in-assembling-a-team-to-make-a-memory-reading-bot/7330</link>
    <description>yea, since every other idea of mine was a failure, im working on something that to my knowledge has not yet been done, an rs bot that reads bytecodes to figure out what to do. 
Unfortunately, whilst i do have experience with bytecode editing, i dont have an understanding of the way the java vm works. Things like memory allocation remain illusive to me, where as in a normal c program its well understood. After this is figured out, we could start hooking some of the apis (are they called apis in java?) if we needed, but i dont think that will happen any time soon. 
I think if a project like this is to proceed, we will need atleast three people who have experience with bytecode editing and programming.

No, &quot;i can use artmonkey and have made a few scar scripts&quot; does not count, what i am talking about is incredibly complicated. 

Is there anyone out there that would be willing to work on such a project?</description>

              <p>the hello world program is kinda generic. i mean, if you wanna make a scar script to say hello world, how many ways are there to do it. also spacing is kinda generic too. if you really want proof, give me something simple (aka less than 10 mins to make) and ill give it to you.</p>
