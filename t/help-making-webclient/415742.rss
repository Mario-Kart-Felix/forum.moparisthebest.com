    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-making-webclient/415742</link>
    <description>Idk if this is the right section but i am trying to make my client into a webclient and I downloaded the jarmaker but I&#39;m getting errors on the main class of the jar maker. So what I&#39;m trying to say is that the jarmaker wont open! 

It would be great if I could get some help i would really appreciate it.
