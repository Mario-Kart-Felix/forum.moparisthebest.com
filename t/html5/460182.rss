<p>Other than that there is no difference.<br>
[/quote]If you used WebGL, it wouldn’t work on a lot of computers/browsers without GPU acceleration and if you ported the 2D canvas draw, it would be a lot slower. It would also have to use WebSockets.<br>
[/quote]WebGL wouldn’t really be a port seeing the Java version isn’t using OpenGL at all…</p>
<p>I doubt there would be any performance issues with 2D canvas… It can handle much more intensive games just fine.</p>
<p>Also, so what if it uses websockets? That’s accounted for with the port to ‘html5’.</p>
<p>What you’re basically pointing out are implementation details, which aren’t the type of differences the OP wants to know…<br>
[/quote]The 2D implementation would probably be slow. Most of the resource intensive games use webgl.[/quote]RSC isn’t resource intensive… It would be just fine, and run well over 20fps.</p>
