    <description>Hello all,

My name is Brian. and to tell you a little about myself;
I am 21 years old dealing with depression but beating it everyday. Who ever is reading this I am 100% sure you are dealing with the same thing. Everyone does. 
Now to get to the point; There is someone that 85% ALL know who might have commited suicide today because of the fucking people on here and other rsps sites. I hope each and everyone one of you know that when you call someone a fag or a piece of shit or whatever you ARE talking to a human being. We ALL have feelings. Go ahead, call me a pussy or whoever else for having feelings, but the fact of the matter is we all give a shit what is said to us.

I dont care if you don&#39;t like what someone posted or what their server looks like. you DO NOT have to tell them they need to die because their fking enums look like shit or they missed a damn bracket. WHO GIVES A FLYING FUCK?!? WE ARE FUCKING KIDS! Grow up and stop acting like that because this is the kind of shit that happens. People take everything you say personally whether they know it or not, it does effect them.

calming down now. PLEASE people, watch what you say to people because it does effect them..


I AM NOT SAYING THIS AGAIN! THIS THREAD IS NOT ABOUT ME, I AM NOT WHINING BECAUSE SOMEONE CALLED ME A NAME, I AM NOT SUICIDAL, MY FEELINGS HAVE NOT BEEN HURT. READ THE POST AND STOP ASSUMING!</description>

<p>You can act as though nothing is bothering you by putting up a barrier, you can tell yourself that you don’t give two shits what he said to you but indirectly it has a huge impact on you. Look at the the kids who shoot up their school; I know they weren’t completely messed up in the head. A lot had to do with verbal abuse.<br>
