[/quote]For the better. I got bullied like hell on this site for a lot of stuff, and look where I am today. I’m a much smarter person because of it, I know how to manage communities, I know when to get mad at something and defend myself, and I learned most of the shit on the internet doesn’t even matter. It’s also reduced how often I make mistakes, because I actually want to avoid any sort of small conflicts that might arise because of them. I think cyberbullying is a great part of the internet (granted it’s with the right people) and coming from a once-12-year-old who went here and was hated, it should mean something.[/quote]<br>
Thank you for your input ,i think that is one good way to look at it. id rep buuuuuut lol</p>

You think thats a bit harsh? Read what the thers have been saying. Tbh, just about everything everyone has said makes no sense. I don’t see what is wrong with me caring about how others feel and standing for something I believe in.[/quote]</p>
<p>What I find wrong is that it’s  annoying. You’re fucking annoying, and all the other cocksuckers like you. You come in pointing fingers at everyone. My school has dumb shits like you at our school suicide assembly’s . Yeah so what they commit suicide, I feel bad. But when you guys start pointing fingers at your audience what fucking response do you honestly expect? Go bitch somewhere else. Fuck, I don’t even see the relevance  this has to this forum. I doubt one person killed themselves over RSPS, you probably pulled it right out of your ass. You have no evidence, crawl back down the shitwhole wence you came</p>

<p>What I find wrong is that it’s  annoying. You’re fucking annoying, and all the other cocksuckers like you. You come in pointing fingers at everyone. My school has dumb shits like you at our school suicide assembly’s . Yeah so what they commit suicide, I feel bad. But when you guys start pointing fingers at your audience what fucking response do you honestly expect? Go bitch somewhere else. Fuck, I don’t even see the relevance  this has to this forum. I doubt one person killed themselves over RSPS, you probably pulled it right out of your ass. You have no evidence, crawl back down the shitwhole wence you came<br>

Pretty hippocrytical that in the aforementioned you were vulgar and rise. Despite me provoking you, wasn’t your point to get people to stop flaming and yelling at people? Personally i don’t give a fuck caus rim not a pussy and want to kill myself over a debate kn a forum. But yeah, also, I don’t really give a fuck who you say “knows” about this shit. Is there any proof? Hell you could’ve said Obama knew it wouldn’t make a fucking difference. No proof no point. All English papers have a concrete detail of evidence before commentary dumbfuck. You’re blinded by ignorance.</p>

        <p>Yes, someone contacted me earlier and I saw the notes and read what Ernie said. I can understand why you wouldn’t say names since his mother seemed very distraught. Now bud, as a suggestion, don’t get upset about what people say on this thread. I suggest instead you turn this into memories thread because there’s no point in yelling at people. It’s done. All you can do now is remember the times you talked to him and what you remember he did. Even if he isn’t someone you liked, he deserves the dignity of being remembered for the good.</p>
<p>Personal memory:</p>
<p>The day we started first talking and although I thought you were annoying as hell, you were young. You had a lot to learn and a lot of places to go in life. For being 14 and learning assembly that’s pretty good. Although I told you to learn the ASM libraries, and not ASM the language. It was a laugh and I feel bad for beating you down for it when I didn’t explain for well.</p>
<p>We had some good talks. About your family, how school was, etc. You were a nice kid. Hope where ever you are, you’re alright. Peace mate.</p>

<p>I agree with you. If there were some outside factors that <span class="bbcode-b">WERE</span> the cause, that would be one thing. But if they committed suicide (if it even happened) solely for remarks made on the internet, then I stand by my statement.</p>
<p>Suicide is not always a form of population control, but it is an effective way. I mean, The chances of you even being created are astronomical. When you take into account the age of the universe, the age of our solar system, the combination of events (6+ life ending disasters on earth alone), the precise chain of evolution that was taken, to get to the point where we are today, and then you go and off yourself because of what’s done to you? If that’s not an ungrateful life, then I don’t know what is.</p>

<p>You’re not getting it. Like, at all. You’re cause and effect logic bullshit comes in at the consideration that internet trolling caused him to kill himself when there was a multitude of reasons. I’ve lost all respect for you now.</p>
<p>Ah, we must be talking about the one I was recently informed of. It’s sort of sad really. One, because if we’re talking about the person I think we are, the last thing I said to him was pretty harsh. The kid was smart and any waste of a mind is a waste to the world. So my condolences go out to him. RIP mate.</p>
<p>Zyle, personally for calling that ‘population control’, I’d beat the shit out of you. If I knew you of course. There isn’t much I can really do but fume. That’s terrible. But maybe I’m just empathetic towards the situation because I feel bad.</p>
<p>Most likely there were other factors most likely linked to the death, like family relationships and in real trials because really from what I read from the note the internet was his chance to escape and it was ruined by people who constantly came after him. It’s a sad situation, although the kid could be a faggot sometimes, I don’t think he really deserved most of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, two coins.</p>

<p>I agree with you. If there were some outside factors that <span class="bbcode-b">WERE</span> the cause, that would be one thing. But if they committed suicide (if it even happened) solely for remarks made on the internet, then I stand by my statement.</p>
<p>Suicide is not always a form of population control, but it is an effective way. I mean, The chances of you even being created are astronomical. When you take into account the age of the universe, the age of our solar system, the combination of events (6+ life ending disasters on earth alone), the precise chain of evolution that was taken, to get to the point where we are today, and then you go and off yourself because of what’s done to you? If that’s not an ungrateful life, then I don’t know what is.[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay, thank you correcting yourself but still I don’t think this is really the place to debate.</p>

<p>To want to kill yourself(imo) means there is some sort of unbalanced chemical going on. I completely agree with you but I DO NOT look at it as pop cntrl. I look at it as a chance someone had to help someone see the light(in a sense). It might be just me but thats how I look at it. Idc if I stand alone standing up for people or if I have people to help me. I do appreciate the people who have positive inputs though</p>
