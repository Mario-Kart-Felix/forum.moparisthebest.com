              <p>Note: this is for PI/ renamed clients.<br>
step 1: get the models for the item you want to add (there are models in the client section of the forums under “models”. there is one for the male equip and female equip)<br>
step 2: make a new file in your client called “raw”. this is where you will put all of your custom items models.<br>
step 3: this is where your client figures out what models to use for the item that you are adding, model rotations and zoom, etc. (im trying to keep it simple so that i dont confuse you). all of this is in itemdef.java under “hardcoded items”. here is an example of the itemdef for a vesta’ s chainbody:</p>
<p><code>		case 13887:
			itemDef.name = "Vesta's chainbody";
			itemDef.actions = new String[5];
			itemDef.actions[1] = "Wear";
			itemDef.modelID = 42593;
			itemDef.modelZoom = 1440;
			itemDef.modelRotation1 = 545;
			itemDef.modelRotation2 = 2;
			itemDef.modelOffset2 = 5;
			itemDef.modelOffset1 = 4;
			itemDef.anInt204 = 0;
			itemDef.maleEquip1 = 42624;
			itemDef.femaleEquip1 = 42644;
			itemDef.description = "Vesta's chainbody.".getBytes();
			break;</code><br>
as you can see, the item code i have set is 13887. that is the item code you will use to spawn the item ingame, as well as going in item.cfg which i will explain later. the item ingame will be called a “Vesta’s chainbody”. The extra action of the item is set to “wear”. you can also change that to “wield” if you want, but that is only for weapons. “male equip” and “female equip” are set to the model numbers for the dat file in the raw folder. then there is the item description.<br>
step 4: This is the last step. your adding the item into your item.cfg file, which is server sided. this is where you add the item id that corresponds with the one you put in itemdef.java, as well as the stats for the item when you equip it. You can use one of the already added items as your guide to which stats are which, etc.<br>
step 5: compile and test. if you did this all correctly, then you are good to go. hope this helped.</p>
