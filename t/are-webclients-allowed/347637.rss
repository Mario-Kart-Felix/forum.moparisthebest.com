    <title>Are webclients allowed?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/are-webclients-allowed/347637</link>
    <description>I was wondering if i should make a webclient, I would really like a webclient because webclients generally have more players. What i am trying to get down to here is can jagex shut down a webclient? Im trying to decide because I would like my server to stick around for a very long time. 

No need for rude posts..... ;)</description>

True, but still, whats the chances? lol<br>

<p>This. On a side note, the server you code is not illegal as it isnt property of jagex so youre safe with it. On the other hand, the cache is illegal but you are very unlikely to be in any danger unless your server gets really big and you are making lots of money.</p>

<p>Have you looked around? lol<br>
theres nothing illigal about moparscape. if you were to make an exact duplicate of runescape and name it RunesGAYpe, they cant do shitt. go to the grocery store and look how many generic brands there are that are the same EXACT thing with another name.<br>
Just dont name it runescape and claim that you are jagex and your straight bro</p>

              <p>they are not allowed, because all the models (or a big part of then) are from runescape, i mean, they are from the original runescape and we “steal” then.
