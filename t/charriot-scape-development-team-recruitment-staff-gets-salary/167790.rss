    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/charriot-scape-development-team-recruitment-staff-gets-salary/167790</link>
    <description>Charriot Scape will be a new Server with awsome &amp; unique features. I cannot do all this work by myself, so I am asking some of the best in this community to come forward and help out.  We will be developing: new items, new interfaces, a webclient, new sprites, and much more.  If we work hard, this could very well be the best sever yet!
So far All we need is some webclient developers. If you do very well, you will get paid.
