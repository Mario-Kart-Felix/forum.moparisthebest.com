    <description>[b]Steenscape![/b]

~._.~ [b]Steenscape[/b] ~._.~
Steenscape is my first server, don&#39;t think it will be REALLY good, it is just an training for me, like coding, ect.
When i&#39;m getting good at it, i am do one of these things:
1-Stop with steenscape, and start againt..;This is if it wont is a really good server...
2-Or im going further with steenscape; This is if i get many help and many players..

~._.~ [b]Me[/b] ~._.~
Im a stupid newb here, total login of 17 hours, but i was reading things alike 16 hours. 
The first thing i did what request a server (Stupid..) But that was very noobish.
Im a ROM hacker, an Pokémon ROM hacker, and my scripting there is.. Very Good. :)
Im coding/Texting/ Ect. all alone, and i want Steenscape become a cool, popular server.
Alone i can&#39;t really do MANY, Im sure there a things i NEVER should learn, Or maybe at the last moment..

I already started steenscape, i use &quot;Project16_v6_EDIT_8&quot; as source, i tested many source&#39;es and like this the most.

~._.~ [b]Features[/b] ~._.~
Steenscape features FULL ancients, Maybe lunar magic! im trying to get ALL skills in (jaj) It will be playing at many places; And places that aren&#39;t used many. So NO varrock. 8D
Ring of stone, Fire cape.
Dialoges, i think..
Kalphite Queen, Barrows, maybe Pest control, King Black Dragon lair, maybe Tz-haar-City, Jad,  more things like these. :P
An updated Pk place (Now v1)

I hope the mods/admins/co-owner i choose are friendly ; But everyone that helps a littlebit i should give credits..


~._.~ [b]Help[/b] ~._.~

Ye, maybe YOU wanna help steenscape!
Almost everyone can help!
And someone who helps REALLY good maybe becomes staff...
This are things i really dont understand:
(I already expiremented with the things)

-How to edit start coords, in my source you always start at lummy tele point, so i dont know what to edit..

These things i need:
- Some cool things for the server. :P

Im trying to get my dad so far that he set up a old stupid Pc as server. Im gonna delete ALL shit form it. 8D
If that won&#39;t luck, maybe one of you wanna host! :/
[i]Note: Something forget a open post? Just say..
Question about Steenscape? Just say...[/i]
