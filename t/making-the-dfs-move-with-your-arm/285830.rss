    <description>Is there away to make the dfs shield move with your arms when blocking? If so, could someone give me a guide to fixing this. I have used the search bar and google.

Thank You,

About 95% of server have the DFS model added to the cache so there is no way to acess it. So, if there was a way search class8.java for the model ID’s and search you model folder for those ID’s. If it is not in there then it wont be a possible edit to the DFS. I have that problem with my server and have been trying to find the original one ins RSMV to re-add it with animations.</p>
