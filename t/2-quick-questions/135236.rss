    <title>2 Quick Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-quick-questions/135236</link>
    <description>Ok, i&#39;m using Wolf&#39;s BlitzPk source, and i&#39;m having a few problems.

No, i am not the best coder in the world, but I am not a PServer newb.

The two things i would like to ask, is:
1) Where do i put cases? I know exactly what do with cases, and have wrote a good 70 on my old server, but when i look for anything that is around the cases i have wrote on my old server, they are not there.
EG: case 299:, /*OBJECT CLICK ONE*/, public void objectClick.

2) How do i lower the experiance rate of combat skills?

Thanks in advance,
