    <title>Looking for a Host</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-host/542289</link>
    <description>Hi, I am Rik (rik452, koolekit, Coder_Rik, Maxcore) some of you may still know me. (Fatality 614 development team and some servers of my own). So I am doing a huge comeback with a 100% coded 639 every detail coded. approximately 2 years ago I had my own server but I sold it because I did not have a plan to code a RSPS again. I am looking for a host.

The host will get the rank &quot;HOST&quot; (with admin rights)

Please comment with your skype or add me Rik452.</description>

              <p>This section is for the development phase of RuneScape Servers. Hosting has nothing to do with development and unless I’ve missed something you cannot ask for a host anywhere on this site. Sorry.</p>
