              <p>[quote=“DaGamerChild, post:1, topic:525560”][center]So, I’m working on a “remake” of Hybrid PVP. I plan to release it as a playable server and host it for a while. It will not go by this name, but by my own name. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I won’t say it here out of fear of it being discovered before its time.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

<p>What do you think? Should I release it as-is now to the community?<br>
Would you play it?</p>
<p>ADDING MEDIA SOON.</p>

<p>I would not. Sounds like a normal PI <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> add more unique like summoning (hybrid pvp had it, don’t call it hybrid-pvp when it doesn’t even have some features like hybrid pvp had) But goodluck aswell <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
