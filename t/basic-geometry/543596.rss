    <description>Hey guys, I have the rest of my finals tomorrow and my brain is fried from studying. I am doing this review packet for Geometry and I cannot figure out this basic problem. I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t figure it out, it&#39;s just not coming to me.

The Base of the triangle and the chord are parallel (I don&#39;t know if everyone knows that the arrow marks mean parallelism) 
I need to solve for x:

No need to thank me for this expertly drawn Triangle.


Anyways: the triangle is scalene

I have tried setting up proportions and other misc. things but I just can&#39;t think atm. Where do I need to start this problem at?</description>

              <p>those two triangles are similar so 2x + 5 / x = 2x - 1 / x - 2.<br>
(2x + 5)(x - 2) = (x)(2x - 1)<br>
2x^2 - 4x + 5x - 10 = 2x^2 - x<br>
x - 10 = -x<br>
2x = 10<br>
x = 5<br>
