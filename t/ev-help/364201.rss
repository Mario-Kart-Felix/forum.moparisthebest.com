    <description>Ughh. This has been pissing me off.

K, well. I have Windows Vista 64-Bit Operating System.
I&#39;ve tried setting my Environmental Variables (EV for short) For A couple days now, and it&#39;s pissing me off.  Nothing will work.  .exe files used to work, I messed with some Variables, now NO .exe or .bat files will work whilst Trying to run my client.

Can someone tell me what my CLASSPATH and path EV&#39;s SHOULD look like?  Remember, I dunno if this makes a difference, but it is windows Vista. (Tbh, Vista fails, I know).  
And yes, I have tried Environmental Variable setter on my computer, but it will not run.

so TY if you could help.  Yes I know I am a noob.</description>
