    <description>Hello I am looking for a few other people to go dungeoneering with me tonight for about 1 or 2 hours or maybe even longer. It&#39;s probably recommended you be around 160 combat as I will be hosting the party. This isn&#39;t a rush thing as I plan on killing everything in time.
I will not tolerate leechers. Get off your bum and work for your levels. 

Use friends chat &quot;Altrika&quot;</description>
