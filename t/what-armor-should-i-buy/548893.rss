    <title>What armor should I buy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-armor-should-i-buy/548893</link>
    <description>Hi guys! (First thread in months!)

Well I was thinking about buying some good armor, and I am thinking of buying Torva. But I heard Tetsu is pretty good too!
Which should I buy? If you have any other recommendations I&#39;ll be glady to hear them.</description>

              <p>If you plan to do high level bosses like RoTS, Vorago, Nex, and KK, you might want to look into getting superior elite void knight armour. Although, I’m sure pest control is dead. I got mine on the mini game weekend in December.</p>

<p>Once you get to 70 you can use tuff like Arma, T80 would be Pernix, T90 would be seismic</p>

If you plan to solo pvm T80 armor is suggested ( so like Torva, pernix, etc )<br>
If you plan to do slayer there isn’t much reason to use for example Pernix when Arma is almost just as good. The only time you should use Pernix instead of Arma are on higher stat needed assignments ( such as fighting airuts or something as they have higher stats such as high defence and decent accuracy)<br>
If you are just camping something  such as waterfiends I would also only suggest Arma.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well, I guess I’ll be using Torva then. For bossing I’ll be using Torva then, for Slayer I’ll be using Bandos as it doesnt degrade and the bonusses are pretty good.<br>
And because my ranged is only 50 and I want to train it to atleast 70 can you recommend any good places to train ranged?</p>
