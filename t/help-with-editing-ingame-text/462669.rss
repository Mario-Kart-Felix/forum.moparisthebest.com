    <description>I need help, is it possible to edit somewhere in a client so whenever you log in-game you will always talk in a certain color. I remember you could edit something in the client so you wouldn&#39;t talk in yellow, but instead talk in white, cyan, red, whatever you put in.

Is there a tutorial how to do this or does anyone know how to?</description>
