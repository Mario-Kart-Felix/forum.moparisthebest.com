    <title>A few changes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-changes/379088</link>
    <description>Some of you will have noticed that I made some changes to the way the rank works.
Those changes are:

[ol][li]The rank &#39;Moparscape Vet&#39; no longer appears in your profile or under your names when you post in topics.[/li]
[li]Your name is no longer yellow in the user list at the bottom of the page[/li][/ol]


There&#39;s only really one reason for this. People are voting people in, or attempting to vote them out, based on things other than programming skill and overall brilliance.
Things like maturity were coming into play, despite the fact that having access to this section and holding a moderator rank are two very different things.

One of the reasons for this, in my opinion, is the fact that some members don&#39;t want to be lumped in with less desirable users. So to fix that problem, everyone is now disassociated from each other.

So to sum up, this section is development centric -- always has been, always will be. 
Nominate people for access based on the fact that they can program well, and thus contribute to development. Don&#39;t nominate people because they&#39;re &#39;nice&#39;, or &#39;mature enough for the rank&#39; -- we have rewards for helpers anyway.</description>

<p>The difference is that global moderators are able to moderate both this section and the community member section. The moparscape moderators don’t actually moderate this section, but were given the rank mostly for the yellow name… which I can’t think of a way to reintroduce without giving them some sort of primary rank.</p>

<p>at the time it was based on programming ability due to the fact that it originally was “50 rep and come on in” automatically. However users complained about this. However I also though we hand pick the cms because we reset rep and gave it only to the cms.</p>

I personally don’t care which way we go, I’d just like to pick the way that furthers this system the most. I can’t see development doing very well, considering the general programming board on this site does far worse than the general discussion or server-related boards (and that being the shitty side of the server-related programming).</p>

That would help, because honestly not much discussion goes on in this section. I wouldn’t consider it dead, but the Vets as a whole rarely create any threads here.</p>

<p>This rank represents “MoparScape CM,” it’s predecessor. It’s a simple reflection of Moparisthebest CM, which is a general discussion board. Granted, CM also had a development board, before the CC’s qqed and gobbled it up. How about you just make a dev board for the Vets, reinstate the rank, then we can all sit down and figure out what the true requisites should be for having this rank.</p>

              <p>Without a notable rank, we do need some sort of way to identify the vets. We need to setup a list or something.</p>
<p>Edit: Okay I’m confused. I’ve been in this section since it was created from the get-go. When have we ever been development-centric, lothy? No topics have been made saying, “this section is for development purposes.” The introductory sticky implies this is supposed to be like MITB CM. It’s a generic discussion board for people who have earned the rank and want a place to cool off, or just to post something they don’t want everyone else to know. We talk less about development in this section than just general discussion.</p>
<p>How about we actually use this rank for it’s real purpose? Add the people who’ve been active for over 2 years, add the people who contribute 5 hours a day to the community, add the people who understand the thorough concepts of the client and protocol, add the people who have earned multiple awards and are extremely helpful. That could sound like a lot, but it’s hardly any. If you want a hidden development group, you’re going to lose most of the veterans we had before. What’s the point?</p>

              <p>The section isn’t going anywhere. You guys need to decide whether having access is really for you.<br>
You lose absolutely nothing now in terms of status, so there’s no reason not to bow out if you’re not really that interested in the happenings of this section.</p>
<p>Moderators were given the vet rank so that their names stood out. It was indeed a bit of laziness on the part of the administration team.<br>
I might change that so that moderators don’t have access to this section (unless they were voted in before receiving moderator).<br>
Would any of you moderators actually miss your access to this section?</p>
<p>Finally, the name ‘Moparscape Vet’ was a bit of a misnomer. I received PMs here and there from users that automatically assumed they should get the rank because they had been around since 2006/2007.</p>
<p>Anyway guys, this change couldn’t be more timely. Mopar is finalising a deal with someone who has sold him a server (which will be released under the AGPL licence) – everyone on this website is going to have the opportunity to show that they’ve got what it takes for access to this section; you guys just need to spot the good eggs, start a poll for them, and reference their contributions to the new server.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think it should continue to be around, but we need to have a set guideline on what should be considered a vet.</p>
<p>Also, I know this is a RSPS based site, and a majority of the development in these sections is going to be based around RSPS, but what about those of us who don’t know much about the client &amp; protocol, but still have things we can offer to this section?  And what about those of us who have things that we would like to release privately, maybe for testing and bug finding before a public release?  Yes there are the CM section(s) over at MITB, but a lot of the people who have access to these sections don’t have access to the CM section(s).  Anyone that actually has something useful to offer to these sections should be admitted, not just those who have something to offer that is Runescape related.</p>
