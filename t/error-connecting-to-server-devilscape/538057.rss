    <description>I recently downloaded this source and client to play around with it I extracted the cache to my c:drive and fixed the compiler and all that stuff you need to do, When I load the game it all pops up and works good but the problem is I can&#39;t log in? I checked the character file and its empty maybe that&#39;s the reason? Idk can someone please please help me.
