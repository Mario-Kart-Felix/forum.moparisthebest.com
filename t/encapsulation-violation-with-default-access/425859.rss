    <title>Encapsulation violation with Default access</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/encapsulation-violation-with-default-access/425859</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve never really used Default access before because I&#39;ve never really seen the point. However, I&#39;ve stumbled upon one such instance where it would actually be useful.

[code=Java]
public class Equipment {
    public static enum EquipmentSlot {
        HEAD(0);

        final int id;

        EquipmentSlot(final int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }
    }

    private final Item[] items = new Item[13];

    public Item getItem(final EquipmentSlot slot) {
        return items[slot.id];
    }
}
[/code]

Now, I could add a normal accessor, but then it just looks quite bloated.

But, in making [i]id[/i] have default access, doesn&#39;t that violate encapsulation by making the data accessible outside of the defining class? Or is my understanding of encapsulation flawed?</description>

              <p>Adding onto what object said, you also need to question whether you want to use a setter or getter for class variables. In that case, the variables will almost always be private, and then you ask the same questions object provided for the getter and/or setter methods. Whether you have those methods is, as I said before, dependent on whether you want programmers to be able to directly work with those class fields, and the limited functionality/potential danger behind that.</p>

<p>OT - The easiest way to look at it is as if the enumeration was just a class inside the other class, because that’s what it is. Don’t forget that having no modifier means that any class <span class="bbcode-i">in the package</span> can access it, not just the class itself.</p>

<p>This.</p>
<p>Java namespaces are poorly setup, imho. Your current namespace is based on the most immediate [tt]package[/tt] declaration in your class hierarchy (which can only exist in the beginning of public classes). As default suggests, all classes and types within a package can access all other default classes and types within that package, regardless of nesting (since a nested class does not define a new namespace).</p>
<p>I am not sure I understand your question about encapsulation. The idea of encapsulation is a design strategy, not a language construct. You can choose to make all of your variables default or higher access (which is a popular design strategy at this website), but that is considered poor programming practice merely because public members can lead to unsafe and unmonitored operations, and also makes it difficult to work with fields complexly or in an inheritance fashion.</p>
<p>In terms of classes, I would almost never recommend you have open-access fields, unless that limited and potentially dangerous functionality is entirely intended and understood. For enumerations, I don’t think it matters. If the enumeration is open-access, I’d probably make the members open-access too, since it’s simply more convenient (and, as you appropriately did, the fields of an enumeration should never be mutable). So for all purposes of the limited enumeration constructs, it makes more sense to have open-access fields rather than a getter method.</p>

<p>Also, since default access means any class in the package can access it, have there been many instances of malicious code exploiting this?

<p>Ah so trying to keep stupid people from doing the wrong thing. Nearly impossible, I wouldn’t worry about it. This is what The Wanderer showed me early this week I believe, correct?</p>

              <p>zyle1992: If you’re really worried about someone “exploiting” your code, then you should really worry about the fact that the Reflection API exists. In other words; if they really want to “exploit” your code, they can. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If your code contains sensitive data, then you perhaps should encrypt it if possible. Or, why not keep the sensitive data on the server-side, if that’s possible.</p>
<p>Anyway, restrict the access of all members as much as you possibly can, without sacrificing your functionality. But, sometimes you may have to rethink your design in order to restrict the access to some member while preserving your functionality. This is usually the way to go if the access would violate other principles.</p>
<p>Think of the different access modifiers like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you allow other developers to access the member you’re currently adding? If your answer is “Yes”, make it public or protected. Should it only be callable from within a superclass, then it should be protected, otherwise public. The access modifiers mentioned here are part of the public API - they’re part of the API contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you <em>not</em> allow other developers to access the member you’re currently adding? If your answer is “Yes”, make it package protected or private. Should it be callable from any class-type or interface-type within the same package, then it should be package protected, otherwise private. The access modifiers mentioned here are part of the private API - they’re implementation details.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have to have a public or protected access modifier on a member that is considered an implementation detail, because your project is built in a way that does not allow you to have package protected or private access modifiers, then I think you should rethink the design of your project.</p>

              <p>I’ve never really used Default access before because I’ve never really seen the point. However, I’ve stumbled upon one such instance where it would actually be useful.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class Equipment {
    public static enum EquipmentSlot {
        HEAD(0);

        final int id;

        EquipmentSlot(final int id) {
            this.id = id;
        }
    }

    private final Item[] items = new Item[13];

    public Item getItem(final EquipmentSlot slot) {
        return items[slot.id];
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, I could add a normal accessor, but then it just looks quite bloated.</p>
<p>But, in making <span class="bbcode-i">id</span> have default access, doesn’t that violate encapsulation by making the data accessible outside of the defining class? Or is my understanding of encapsulation flawed?</p>
