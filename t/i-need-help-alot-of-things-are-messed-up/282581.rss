    <description>i need help with alot of stuff                        PimpScape Source

1. when people use the magic telly tabs to telly, when they telly the person turns small and then tellys to the place but the person doesnt go back to normal size it stays small and then they cant move and there small ( how do i fix this ) and yes i have coords to telly to   Most important one 

2. when someone pks and then when someone dies the person who killed them can still see them where they died but they are not there but then when the person who die walks you can see them but there not where they really are like there in a different area then you see them

3. How do i get the restarter to restart my server (well it restarts but it doesnt put the server back up it stays down) how do i fix this and get it to put it right back up after it shuts it down 

4. how do i add the name of my server, players, and restarter countdown to the tops of the screen so everyone can see. Because when i add the player and name code to client java it doesnt show on the server and i dont know the code for the countdown timer to display them.</description>
