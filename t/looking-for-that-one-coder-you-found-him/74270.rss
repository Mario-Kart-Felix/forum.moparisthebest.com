    <title>Looking for that one coder? you found him</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-that-one-coder-you-found-him/74270</link>
    <description>I have created my server, chillaxscape, was a great server but people just so happened to ruin it. So now i&#39;m going to sell it and help people code there server. I&#39;m looking for a pair team, me and someone else. I will help them with just about everything. If you have any questions, contact me at robbing_mexican@hotmail.com i&#39;m on just about 24\7 ( no i&#39;m not a computer nerd it&#39;s just spring break for me and I thought i would help people )

Reason why i&#39;m so good at coding
1. I have learned alot from other players so my brain power on coding has increased drastically
2. I have helped other people with there servers and now it&#39;s come out to be great
3. I can also make banners and websites ( I don&#39;t really know how that&#39;s coding LAWL but o well).
4. I&#39;m AMAZING =P

So add me right now and we can get to work on creating something brilliant.

P.S - If interested in buying my server I have removed alot of things but it is still a great server. Tons of commands, good shops and other things as well. Add me on my msn if interested in that as well =)


Thank you,
         Flame!</description>

              <p>ThatOneServer is That One Coder?.. Jk…  i dont want to help, but heres my opinion. Its not fun to code with somebody else… like coding a server with somebody else. They can make an edit at the same time as you, and now one of you have to code again.</p>
