    <description>Hello guys,
I&#39;m using a Delta 317, and I don&#39;t have much information on this problem.

Basically I would like all the character&#39;s actions to take place when they are next to the object they click on.

Right now, opening doors, talking, etc.  can all be done no matter how far away the player is.  For example, the door would open even if the player is 5 spaces away and hasn&#39;t completely walked there yet.

Any ideas on the class to look to for fixing this, as well as possible fixes, would be much appreciated.  I don&#39;t really know where to start.</description>
