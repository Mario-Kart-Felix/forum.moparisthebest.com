    <description>I need i good coder for my server, i&#39;ll be willing to pay that person a lot of money and give them co-owner status on my server.

If the coder does a good jod, they will receive 5m in real RuneScape and like i said become co-owner of my server.

[b]server source:[/b] mimescape pk/fr33sc4p3 which ever one the coder wants to do i guess.. &lt;-- i&#39;ll change it if coder doesn&#39;t like it.

I&#39;ll like to have 2 server but are the same like 1 is hamachi and the other one is no-ip.
