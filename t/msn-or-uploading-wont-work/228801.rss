    <title>MSN or Uploading Wont Work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/msn-or-uploading-wont-work/228801</link>
    <description>Note: The only way I got this picture is I turned GhostSurf back on and it would let me sign into MSN and upload pictures etc...

Ok my problem is that I want to uninstall GhostSurf, Because it is taking up like 155,000 K of memory. So I ended it and my computer runs faster. But I come to a problem when I turn it off I cant log onto MSN, or upload pictures... Anyone got any ideas on how I can remove it and fix my problem? because when i try to remove it, the uninstall box wont get any progress and will stay there at the same area with nothing in it.

Help please I looked through my registry and all to remove this program and I cant even find it in the registry.

              <p>msconfig, diagnostic startup… then see. It happened to me and that’s how I fixed it.</p>
<p>Basically, you need to stop Ghostsurf from starting up, then kill it.</p>
