    <title>World of Tanks Bonus Codes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/world-of-tanks-bonus-codes/541028</link>
    <description>I have 4 of them. I will send one to the first 4 posters. There are 2 part codes, one is for a new account, one is for existing. 
Existing user gets:
1k gold
100k credits
1 week premium
New User:
1k gold
M22 locust+garage slot
1 week premium

Do not pm me about more, because i only have these 4 left. and only one code can be activated on any 1 account, so it is useless trying to get extras. Also, i have two that were already given out for existing codes, and if someone wishes to try the New user code out on it they may, and tell me if it works. at which case i will have twice as many (: Happy posting.
Make your response either NEW USER or EXISTING USER so i know which to send.</description>
