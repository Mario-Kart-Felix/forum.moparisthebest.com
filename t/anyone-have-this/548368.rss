    <description>Anyone been able to successfully rip rsca&#39;s sleep method and input it into a client?
I&#39;ve tried to do it, and i&#39;ve got it really close but it is buggy as hell, wondering if anyone has a working client with it available for me?


***edit*** I&#39;ve already successfully ripped their sleep method server side. Just need client side</description>
