    <description>This model was requested by somebody on R-S, and I&#39;d never made gloves, so I made an attempt at it. I think they turned out pretty good, but I wanted other opinions on it, so I decided to make a new thread for it.

              <p>i don’t care about the wireframe or any BS, but i think you need better ideas of what to model. try Google concept art or something, because i really don’t like the outcomes of these models<br>
i know you did this for some request, and yeah i cant find a problem with the wire-frame, but if the end result doesn’t look good that’s more important than all the other crap<br>
im not saying you aren’t a good modeler or whatever, just focus on the end result more and find something better to model</p>

It really isn’t that bad of a model. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> The colors don’t match that well, but that is what the image sort of looked like. And if someone ever requests me to make a model I do it how they want it, for they are the client. I don’t make it and say well that’s too bad it was a bad idea anyways. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> That’s insulting them.<br>
<img src="http://myronpoeteray.com/images/2d_digital/raven_paladin_001.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Also amy, con<span class="bbcode-b">c</span>ept is the artists choice. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Not everyone is going to have the same choice as you, no need to be so harsh over concept. It really is a decent model, and doing the fingers challenges him to make something of a higher difficulty. Not really a bad thing…[/quote]<br>
As a modeller, who would know better about the models, they should atleast advise they chose different colours or even a few changes to save polys.  I think the model could have been done better, but thats just me. Everytime someone has requested a model from me which doesn’t look that appealing i try and convince them they could do better by lets say, changing the colours or a few adjustments. It could just be me, but i try to achieve the best for someone i model for.</p>

<p>Well, how about you make your own models with your own consept? Just because one person wants it that specific way doesn’t mean others do, so work on your own models and post them. These models you’ve been making for these people look, i don’t mean to be rude, but they look horrible. The colours don’t complerely go together and the models are just plain and gauntlets with claws have been made so many times before. So just make your own models and release them, something you’re happy with and that others will enjoy too.</p>

<p>It really isn’t that bad of a model. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> The colors don’t match that well, but that is what the image sort of looked like. And if someone ever requests me to make a model I do it how they want it, for they are the client. I don’t make it and say well that’s too bad it was a bad idea anyways. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> That’s insulting them.<br>

<p>Also amy, con<span class="bbcode-b">c</span>ept is the artists choice. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> Not everyone is going to have the same choice as you, no need to be so harsh over concept. It really is a decent model, and doing the fingers challenges him to make something of a higher difficulty. Not really a bad thing…</p>

You don’t need the fingers for an RSPS, if you haven’t noticed they do not have them on the original model. you could have just modelled around the fist from the RS char and then added your claws on them, alot simpler then making fingers.<br>
