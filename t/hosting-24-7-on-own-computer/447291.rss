    <title>Hosting 24/7 on Own Computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hosting-24-7-on-own-computer/447291</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently trying to host a 24/7 server from my own spare windows system. I&#39;ve been searching around google and the forums for a while now, but I&#39;m looking for ways to monitor/make sure my server is staying up 24/7, because in the passed when I&#39;ve been testing it, normally after about 24-48 hours of running, it&#39;ll randomly go down(whether because of a syipkpker attack or general error that I never actually looked up on google because I&#39;m stupid). I have also tried to just use a server restarter, but that doesn&#39;t always work either, because sometimes when the server gets restarted it doesn&#39;t successfully start back up again until the time interval runs out and it is restarted again. Does anyone know of an alert tool of some kind that would play a sound or something if my server were to go down? or a server restarter that pings my rsps and will only restart the server if it see&#39;s that it&#39;s down(this would be ideal)? I do realize that it would be best for me to just use a VPS or something for a 24/7 rsps, but I don&#39;t have any experience with linux, and I feel like if I was going to pay for a windows vps, I might as well host it myself anyway and save the money.

Thanks for the help.</description>
