    <title>Development team, Project Name (not yet known)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/development-team-project-name-not-yet-known/437494</link>
    <description>Hello.
Some of you are probably wondering why is some new guy making a dev team post? Well I have older accounts but I don&#39;t feel like blowing off dust from old books.

So this server will be a group project. The reason why no source, images, name, or anything has been released is because I think my team should help decide that.

I am here for that team, I will be coding, and making all graphic design/propaganda.

The source will more or likely be, PI or Delta depending on my teams skill set.

The type of server will be dependent on the team, either a Remake, Eco, pk, Eco+Pk, or Spawn.

First these are the requirements to apply,
[i]Mature,
13+
Polite
Easy to work with others
Good Listener
Work Efficiently
Be on at least 3 times a week [/i]

Now for the open spots and duties of these spots.
Coder: 0/3 [size=7pt](Work will be evenly distributed giving all coders equal credit)[/size]
Hoster: 0/1 [size=7pt](To host 24/7, so that the server status page on mopar stays at 100%, Must be reliable)[/size]
Web Designer: 0/1 [size=7pt](To create a web with stand alone domain, either free such as dot.tk or co.cc or a purchased domain. If web designer doesn&#39;t develop a nice enough website/forums then I will take that role.)[/size]
Video Editor: 0/1 [size=7pt](Create and Edit Videos to upload to YouTube, some cases to edit prerecorded videos)[/size]
Beta Tester: 0/4 [size=7pt](To test out the server before release, this is so we can fix bugs/glitches/dupes and all, you will be required to try all duping, glitches, bugs that you can think of and report them so we may fix)[/size]

About myself(for those who wish to know who they work with)
I am 15, I live in Eastern United States, I know how to code even though I might be rusty from a long time away from private servers in general but I won&#39;t slow anyone down :P, I do GFX, such as here [IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/ne9a35.jpg[/img]
I am a overall active, nice kid who just wants to stop playing shit servers and actually make a good one like the olden days when it was just 317, and it was basic good old RSPS. So please help me do that.

I will be adding info such as images, source, name, and all other information when the team is started.

Now for the Application.
