    <description>First off, I started this a long time ago, stopped, got bored and finished it today.

I really don&#39;t care much about it, and I only made it for shits &#39;n giggles.

If anyone learns anything from it, that&#39;s great.

GPL License.


Excerpt from the readme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Accessor Method Injector v0.9 by The Bank

-----------------------------------------


To run this application, simple use the Run.bat (Windows) or Run.sh (Linux/Mac) file.  The application should auto-start.

If complications arise, ensure you have the latest JDK installed.

The main class is &quot;injector.MethodInjectorGUI&quot;




This tool is used to inject a custom accessor method into any class you want.  This is useful when it comes to an obfuscated class file, as they can rarely be decompiled and recompiled easily.  This way, you can easily inject an accessor method into a class without having to write your own injection code, or find a working decompiler tool.

So, what is an accessor method?  An accessor method is sometimes called a &quot;get-method&quot;, which is the opposite of a &quot;set-method&quot;.  Accessor methods are constructed like this:

public int getBikeSpeed()
{
	return bikeSpeed;
}


We use accessor methods for a number of reasons, but if you are using this tool it is probably because you want to return a value which you shouldn&#39;t be accessing under normal circumstances.




How to use this tool:
---------------------

There are two important folders to this program.  The first is the &quot;input&quot; folder, the second is the &quot;output&quot; folder.

The input folder is where you put the class(es) that you want to inject the method into.  The output folder is where the final class is placed, after the method is injected.  It is worth noteing that the class in the input folder is not changed, in case you choose to go back to an origional version.


Once the application is started, a table will be populated with all the classes in the input folder, you must select the one that you wish to inject a method into.

Under the table, you find three text areas.  Method Name, Field Name, and Field Type.

Method Name: The name of the method you want to inject, name it what you want.

Field Name: The name of the field you want to inject, name it what you want.

Field Type: The type of the field you want to inject, this MUST be the real field type, or your accessor method will not work.  If you want to use a custom Type that is not built into the JVM (for example, the class &quot;Car&quot; in some project), then you have to include the Class that corrisponds to that Type in the ROOT of this tool (the same directory this README is in).

Press the &quot;Inject&quot; button and your class will have the method injected to it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Questions/comments etc are appreciated.

I realized I haven&#39;t contributed much lately so, meh.

Also, it adds a custom interface name, &quot;get&quot; plus the name of the class, feel free to change it to whatever you want.</description>

              <p>First off, I started this a long time ago, stopped, got bored and finished it today.</p>
<p>I really don’t care much about it, and I only made it for shits 'n giggles.</p>
<p>If anyone learns anything from it, that’s great.</p>

<p>Excerpt from the readme:</p>
<blockquote>Accessor Method Injector v0.9 by The Bank
<hr>
<p>To run this application, simple use the Run.bat (Windows) or Run.sh (Linux/Mac) file.  The application should auto-start.</p>
<p>If complications arise, ensure you have the latest JDK installed.</p>
<p>The main class is “injector.MethodInjectorGUI”</p>
<p>This tool is used to inject a custom accessor method into any class you want.  This is useful when it comes to an obfuscated class file, as they can rarely be decompiled and recompiled easily.  This way, you can easily inject an accessor method into a class without having to write your own injection code, or find a working decompiler tool.</p>
<p>So, what is an accessor method?  An accessor method is sometimes called a “get-method”, which is the opposite of a “set-method”.  Accessor methods are constructed like this:</p>
<p>public int getBikeSpeed()<br>
{<br>
return bikeSpeed;<br>
}</p>
<p>We use accessor methods for a number of reasons, but if you are using this tool it is probably because you want to return a value which you shouldn’t be accessing under normal circumstances.</p>
<h2>How to use this tool:</h2>
<p>There are two important folders to this program.  The first is the “input” folder, the second is the “output” folder.</p>
<p>The input folder is where you put the class(es) that you want to inject the method into.  The output folder is where the final class is placed, after the method is injected.  It is worth noteing that the class in the input folder is not changed, in case you choose to go back to an origional version.</p>
<p>Once the application is started, a table will be populated with all the classes in the input folder, you must select the one that you wish to inject a method into.</p>
<p>Under the table, you find three text areas.  Method Name, Field Name, and Field Type.</p>
<p>Method Name: The name of the method you want to inject, name it what you want.</p>
<p>Field Name: The name of the field you want to inject, name it what you want.</p>
<p>Field Type: The type of the field you want to inject, this MUST be the real field type, or your accessor method will not work.  If you want to use a custom Type that is not built into the JVM (for example, the class “Car” in some project), then you have to include the Class that corrisponds to that Type in the ROOT of this tool (the same directory this README is in).</p>
<p>Press the “Inject” button and your class will have the method injected to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Questions/comments etc are appreciated.</p>
<p>I realized I haven’t contributed much lately so, meh.</p>
<p>Also, it adds a custom interface name, “get” plus the name of the class, feel free to change it to whatever you want.</p>
