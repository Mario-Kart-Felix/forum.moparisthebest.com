    <title>317 Bigger hits on different client [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-bigger-hits-on-different-client-pi/555390</link>
    <description>So, I&#39;m running a PI 317 on this client, and on one client, the hits are normal, like 0-99, and on the other it is 0-999

What can I change on the client so that the hits are 0-999? 

What I mean by this is if I hit a 20 on an opponent, it&#39;d show a 20. I want it to show a 200, like it does on this other client, but can&#39;t figure out why.

let me know! I&#39;m sure it&#39;s an easy fix.

EDIT: I figured it out. I changed the boolean of newDamage to true. my b boys</description>
