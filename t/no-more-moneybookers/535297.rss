    <title>No more moneybookers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/no-more-moneybookers/535297</link>
    <description>I was trying to buy membership earlier by using moneybookers, but when I was abotu to pay and was at choosing how to pay, I realized there wasn&#39;t moneybooker button anymore?
Was this just temporary thing or something, since I can&#39;t get membership any other way. 
Anyone knows anything about this?</description>

              <p>You would have better luck asking on the RS forums to be honest. I’d imagine because claims are harder to get appealed there versus paypal.</p>
