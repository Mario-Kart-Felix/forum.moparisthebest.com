    <description>Alright, well this is going to sound probably really pathetic on what im about to ask because i know it is actually pretty simple but.. I forgot how to do this as i quit rsps for awhile and have come back. 

What i need to do is make it so you need runes for every spell in the spell book, including teleports.

I am using a devolution based source..317 Please help me.</description>
