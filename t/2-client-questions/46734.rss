    <title>2 Client Questions</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-client-questions/46734</link>
    <description>I didn&#39;t know were to put these so I put them here. I have to problems with my client, both I can deal with but it would be nice to fix.

1. I used welshscape for my client base and I wanted to know if its possible to remove the fire or add another 3D animation in there possibly useing a .gif format (Macromedia Flash)

2. I want to change the color of the loader bar which I&#39;m sure can be done but I&#39;m bot good with clients.

Help is appreciated and as a reminder, I am trying to put out a coding team for ZezumaScape.

Thanks in advance-
