&lt;blockquote&gt;Marines charged in rape of girl, 12

By Star-Bulletin staff and the Lawton (Okla.) Constitution

POSTED: 01:30 a.m. HST, Jul 24, 2009


A Kaneohe Marine and two other Marines on the mainland have been charged in Oklahoma with first-degree rape of a 12-year-old girl.

A warrant has been issued for the arrest of Pfc. Jordan P. Kinshella, 18, who was charged Tuesday for the alleged rape of the girl on April 1, according to court records.

Kinshella has been assigned to 1st Battalion, 12th Marine Regiment, at Marine Corps Base Hawaii at Kaneohe Bay since May 24. He has been a Marine since Sept. 15 and has not deployed, according to the Marine Corps.

Kaneohe Marine spokesman Maj. Alan Crouch said yesterday that the investigation is ongoing, and no further details were available.

Media inquiries in Hawaii were being forwarded to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service in Washington, D.C.

Kinshella is among several Marines accused of having sex with the sixth-grade girl as part of what investigators call a bizarre and disturbing sex scandal, according to a Lawton (Okla.) Constitution report. The Marines were attending the U.S. Marine Battery at Fort Sill, Okla., which serves as a temporary school for Marines who take classes and undergo training.

Authorities allege 33-year-old Amy Rivera had befriended the girl and taken her to parties with the Marines at a hotel, the Constitution reported. The newspaper said Rivera was charged June 29 with procuring a child for lewdness or other indecent acts. Her bail was set at $7,500.

The girl&#39;s parents, age 39 and 36, were charged last week with enabling child neglect, a felony punishable by up to life in prison, for allowing their daughter to stay with Rivera.

Comanche County District Attorney Fred Smith told the Army Times early this month that Rivera, of Fletcher, Okla., befriended the Marines after her husband deployed to Iraq, partying with them regularly. She began bringing the girl to the parties in March, with several Marines having sex with her until recently, Smith told the Army Times.

Lance Cpl. Logan Combs, 19, was arrested and charged on July 1 with first-degree rape that allegedly occurred on March 31. He is being held at the Comanche County Detention Center in Oklahoma in lieu of $30,000 bond.

On July 14, investigators also charged 19-year-old Pfc. Curtis G. Dorton with first-degree rape, which allegedly occurred on May 8. A warrant was issued for his arrest. Dorton is stationed at Twentynine Palms, Calif.

According to court records, police sought out the Marines after the 12-year-old told investigators she had sex with them and mentioned them by name, the Constitution reported.

The newspaper added that authorities believe several more Marines sexually assaulted the girl over several months, and they are working on tracking them down since they are no longer at Fort Sill.

<p>Anyway, we don’t die of starvation, the Africans do, and other countries with no source of food. Now for the topic, the Marines themselves don’t rape young girls. It was just a person IN America, and Americans are mostly the source for molest, but so are other countries. Don’t judge America because you are in another country and there have been things in the past. Britain shouldn’t because America and Britain are technically friends. Russia and America are OKAY. Some other people from different countries on this forum have got to be in the United Nations, founded by America and Britain. Stop being ignorant, stop flaming me, and get a grip on yourselves. You’re giving this community a bad reputation. Jesus fucking Christ.<br>
