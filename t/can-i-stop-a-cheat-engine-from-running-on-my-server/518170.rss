    <title>Can I stop a cheat engine from running on my server?</title>

    <description>Hello moparscape community!

Here&#39;s my problem:
   I have a PI ErasedPkz base server and people can use cheat engine to dupe through the dueling arena and general store. I would rather not disable the dueling arena or remove the general store, so I was checking to make sure if anybody knew of a script to close Cheat Engine each time a player opens or has it open with my server process running.

   Is there a way to run a script in everybody&#39;s run.exe for my server that will close the cheat engine process when the client starts?</description>
