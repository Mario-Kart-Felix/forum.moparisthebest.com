McMMO:
McMMO is an intensive plugin which adds many attributes to our current game-play. It mainly focuses on multiple level-able player skills that enable one to use abilities in order to be more productive and that add flare to the current game play. As well as adding another dimension which will lead to a more enjoyable gaming experience. There are many skills and commands associated with the plugin; info about them can be found here.

Some of the main commands are:
/mcc - Shows list of commands
/stats - Shows your skill levels
/skillname - Shows information on specific skill
/mctop - Shows top ranking McMMO players
/mctop [ability]  - Shows top players for each ability

Economy:
We have an interactive server shop that is primarily for rare and unobtainable items. It&#39;s also a good route to sell extra cobblestone and dirt you have in your inventory. This becomes very useful while digging and/or mining!

User shops are located in the &quot;Shops&quot; area outside of spawn. Anyone can set up a shop for free using the dynamic &quot;Chestshop&quot; plugin for Bukkit. It&#39;s very easy to set up and a good way to sell or buy items. We have a guide on our forums about setting up your own shop.


Rules:
1. Absolutely No Griefing. Ask an admin to protect your house. You and anyone you desire can modify blocks in that area.

2. No Hacking/Duping/Modding of any kind.(this includes no-clip/flying and super speed, among others.)

3. Be Respectful to all other players: guests, members, mods, and admin.

4. No offensive or excessively obscene language, actions, or structures.

5. No Killing and/or Dealing Damage to others who are not willing (If two or more players all agree to a duel/battle, then it&#39;s acceptable). If you&#39;ve read these rules and are applying to the server, please include a money sign in your post.

6. Looting is frowned down upon, luckily LWC is available for everyone&#39;s use. Utilize this command to protect your chests, doors, signs, and furnaces!(We have no sympathy for people who get looted as a result of failing to use LWC)

7. Buildings should not be unaesthetic(UGLY), or encroach on other players&#39; building areas.

Reviews:
&quot;If you are an older player and looking for a great server, look no further. I&#39;m 34 and I enjoy coming on People&#39;s Minecraft Server everyday. We have a great group of diverse players and we are always looking for people who just want to build/explore with a chill bunch of people, and keeping things as drama free as possible. Our moderators/admin are on constantly and we take your positive experience on our server very seriously. Trust me, as many people have said before &quot;This is the kind of server I was looking for.&quot; -SirJareth 

&quot;I just want to say that this truly an amazing server! There is absolutely NO lag (I play from Great Britain) and it feels just as fast as Single Player! The people on the server are nice and helpful and if you are unsure about something, a member will give you the answer within seconds!&quot; -Wickthor
