    <title>[Delta - 317] !WITH VIDEO! Attacking causes disconnect in special area? WTF?!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-317-with-video-attacking-causes-disconnect-in-special-area-wtf/350167</link>
    <description>[b][u]Hello, thank you for viewing my thread.[/u][/b]

As the title would sudjest I&#39;m using Delta source. I havn&#39;t had any combat problems before this. Anyways, I thought of a minigame where you would face a random &quot;boss&quot; monster and if you managed to defeat it you would be given a reward. I found that Fight Arena (the Khazard place) was the perfect location for this minigame. So I went there, removed the khazard that already were there, fixed the doors in the main building so they could be opened and closed. Next I added some basic Arena Guard NPC and placed a few inside the main building, just for looks.

I added an admin command that would start the minigame for me to test my minigame.
[code]if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;arena&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 2)) {
killMyNPCs();
resetfollowers();
heightLevel = 0;
talk(&quot;Good look out there. Try not to die too fast.&quot;,1200);
toX = 2603;
toY = 3155;
FightOpp = misc.random(2) +1 ;
resetfollowers();
if(FightOpp == 0){
FightOppID = 1885;
sM(&quot;You will face Dad.&quot;);
}
if(FightOpp == 1){
FightOppID = 100;
sM(&quot;You will face Goblin Invader.&quot;);
}else if(FightOpp == 2){
FightOppID = 1540;
sM(&quot;You will face Teraz Lahyl.&quot;);
}
SpawnFightOpp(FightOppID);
sM(&quot;Enemy ID:&quot;+FightOppID);
}[/code]

NPC&#39;s spawned just fine (random NPC) but when I attacked a monster I was disconnected and my client displayed a T2 Error.
[b]Error message:[/b]
[URL=http://img840.imageshack.us/i/clienterrorlog.png/][IMG]http://img840.imageshack.us/img840/7179/clienterrorlog.png[/img][/URL]

Since T2 is a rather common error message I tried removing what I had added to the area. I removed all the Arena Guards I had placed, didn&#39;t help. I tried spawning loads of different NPC&#39;s to attack (not by ::npc ID, but by adding them to autospawn.cfg) but every time I attack any NPC at that area I get the error and I get disconnected.

Oh almost forgot, I know it&#39;s the area casuing this because when I try to attack the same NPC&#39;s at an other location (falador mine) it works perfectly fine.

I uploaded a video of me first fighting &quot;Goblin Invader&quot; and  &quot;Teraz Lahyl&quot; without any bugs in Falador Mine and then teleporting to Fight Arena and trying to attack the exact same NPC&#39;s but over there I get the error and disconnect.

It should be mentioned that there already was some sort of an &quot;Assult&quot; minigame located at the Fight Arena where you would kill Khazard warriors to get points and then buy rune claws. But I removed these NPC&#39;s.

If you have any idea what is causing this or how to fix it, please help me... I wouldn&#39;t want to move my minigame because I feel that the Fight Arena is the perfect place for it.</description>

              <p>Meh… I can’t seem to find GetNpcPos anywhere, I’ll just try to move to a different area instead</p>
<p>Edit: stupid me was looking for it server side lol… I came accross this code in my client.java client side.</p>
<p><code>        if(class30_sub2_sub2.anInt1406 != i)
        {
            signlink.reporterror(aString1173 + " size mismatch in getnpcpos - pos:" + class30_sub2_sub2.anInt1406 + " psize:" + i);
            throw new RuntimeException("eek");
        }</code><br>
I’ve looked thought class30_sub2_sub2.java and tbh I get nothing. It’s all just a bunch of different methods and I wasn’t able to find any NPC ID’s in there… Do you (or anyone else) know how to work the GetNpcPos?</p>
<p>I added the Khazard guys again and I could fight them and now for some reason, I can attack all NPC’s I spawn in the fight arena. But only the ones I spawn with autospawn.config. When I do my ::Arena command and try to attack the npc that is spawned, I still get disconnected and the T2 error comes up. Is there any way to fix this or would I have to try to recode my minigame? (Like having the different boss npc’s spawned already and just make a random one attack the player)</p>
<p>Edit: Please help me, I’ve tried several different locations, I get the same bug everywhere except the small area with the goblins seen in the video in falador cave it seems  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I don’t see how you’d have to add NPC ID’s and cord to GetNpcPos seeing how it’s client side and adding NPC’s is server side and my client isn’t sever specific…</p>

<p>Alright I guess I could try to move it. Although, as mentioned before there already was a minigame in Fight Arena where you killed Khazard warrior, and there was no problem with fighting back then.

<p>But I’ll check out some different areas that could work for my minigame. Thank you for replying  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>

thats because the assault minigame NPC ID’s such as khazard boss, minion, w/e <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
were added in client.java in these certain coords. thats why the client recognizes them.<br>
but, however when u attack the goblin guy, the client looks in the server for the NPC ID’s in your GetNpcPos(); and if it doesnt find it, it disconnects[/quote]</p>
<p>So, I could try to add my new NPC ID’s and cords to the GetNpcPos(); and it would work?</p>
