    <title>Router Question. Should be easy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/router-question-should-be-easy/48917</link>
    <description>OK  well, I&#39;m on my router and I tried setting up my port.
I have a different port set up because mine says &#39;gamming and applictions&#39; instead of saying &#39;Advanced&#39;.
I&#39;ve done no-ip and stuff like that, but still can&#39;t get server up 
I think it&#39;s ethier no-ip or my router. If you know anything about how to set up my router please post here. And I don&#39;t want links to portforward.com

Thank-YOU
