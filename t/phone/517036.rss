    <description>So my phone has stopped charging and this happens to be my second charger. I didn&#39;t think it was my first charger that was failing but when a friend of mine let me use theirs, I went out and bought a second one and my phone would charge without losing connection. Now my phone won&#39;t charge at all and I believe it is the charging port on my phone itself now. Is there any home remedies that you guys may know about or will I have to go to the store to get it replaced?</description>

That’s my conclusion based upon a few minutes of research though.[/quote]</p>
<p>I got that conclusion as well since I looked into it. Oh well.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:2, topic:517036”]Firstly, I’d recommend you buy and a new battery and see how that goes they can be as cheap as £5 (in my country, different countries are subject to different pricing of course).</p>
<p>The only other recommendation I give you is to look online and their should be a fair few mobile phone (cellphone) forums which can give you a better understanding of the issue and hopefully you might find a solution on those forums.</p>
<p>What phone (cellphone) have you got? Have you purchased a new battery yet (I had an issue with my phone randomly dying/not turning on for a while and that was due to having a random brands battery in my Blackberry despite it allegedly being compatible with my phone)? Is their anything that you have done to your phone by accident that you can think of that may have damaged your phone?[/quote]</p>
<p>I have a Samsung Stratosphere via Verizon. I replaced my battery with my friends who had an extra lying around. While it improved the length of phone’s life, it didn’t change the way it charged with my first charger. A few months ago I dropped my phone for the first time in the year and a half I’ve had this phone and cracked the screen. Otherwise, no.</p>
<p>I will look into other forums, I felt it was appropriate to ask here because some people are more knowledgable than those on cellphone forums in certain cases.</p>
