    <description>Topics like [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,620501.0.html]this[/url] serve no purpose except boosting post count.

Further, what are the rules for such games? In the past they&#39;ve been against the rules, but it looks like this rule has been removed from the sectional rules.</description>

<p>Lol. So your saying none of us on this forum can amuse ourselves for a few minutes a day playing forum game on this site?

If you’re seriously that bored that you want to play games on a forum, get off the computer, or at the very least find some browser games to occupy your time.[/quote]<br>
