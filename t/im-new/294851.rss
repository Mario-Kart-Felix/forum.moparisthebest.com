    <description>I&#39;m new to making private servers =/.

I have a couple questions. I was looking on how to make an own custom downloadable client, and it said I had to find this JAVAC file in my BIN folder. I can&#39;t find that. On top of that it says I need JDK5 or 6, which I downloaded D:. Does it mean update 5 or 6? One more thing, could I make a private server out of this? It was a really good one, but the guys hard drive crashed, and I want to edit it around a little bit. Put custom things and stuff, but I&#39;m new to this whole thing. It wasn&#39;t a custom source, but a lot of servers weren&#39;t really made like this. I liked it, though, so I want to build on it. Please help if you know. Here&#39;s a pic:http://img43.imageshack.us/i/newbitmapimage3g.png/ and here&#39;s another http://img43.imageshack.us/i/newbitmapimage3g.png/

here&#39;s where I got the guide how to make the client (I think this is how to make the your own custom client) http://www.techspot.com/vb/all/windows/t-102247-How-to-make-your-own-runescape-private-server.html

If that&#39;s not it, I was looking for something where I could change the skins, and make it compatible with the new server. I&#39;m so clueless :(

              <p>I see. It probably will say I don’t have JDK5 or JDK6. I made a path of whatever it’s called, and ran cmd. I then ran javac, but that didn’t work. Also, could I make my own server with just a client?</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
I have a Verizon Wireless Modem…I don’t have to do the port forwarding, right?</p>

              <p>if your new with coding, i suggest you use a source like… figment scape, or any other servers that have a lot of glitches in them… so you can learn how to “fix” them.</p>
<p>and… just look at other topics on “server help” or “server guides” and after a while you will get use to java.</p>
