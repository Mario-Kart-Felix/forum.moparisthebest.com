    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sydneyscape-final-release-enjoy/307008</link>
    <description>[CENTER][B]Hi there!
Its finally time to say goodbye to SydneyScape 317 and mvoe onto SydneyScape 508.

IM NOT POSTING PICTURES....YOU CAN USE GOOGLE, YOUTUBE OR JUST LOGIN TO THE CLIENT FFS. THE SERVER WILL BE DOWN AS OF TOMORROW![/B][/CENTER]

Many of you may know this server...and many of you may hate or love it. For me, it was a learning experience, as it was my first major server and was hosted for about a year and a half. It went through its ups and downs (reaching 220+ players and going below 10) but its time is up. A lot of hard work and time has gone into this project and at the end of the day, its just a shame i started on Delta....

As a lot of people know, SydneyScape started off with some terrible delta-like stability, but as time went on it got better, with the help of Gnarly. Gnarly implemented much better stability while i continued on with the client and features.

The custom specials... Ok so i put the custom items in, just like many of the other servers out there, but ni wanted them to be bit more....custom.... So i added unseen special attacks. For example, there are many whips, but all are there for a purpose. Some examples of a few whips...
Purple whip - Great for pures, a little less stronger than a normal whip but can train strength and only requires 70 str to weild.
White whip - Removes opponents protect item
Bandos whip - MASSIVE str bonus, slow, no special, trains str
Dragon whip - fast and strong
Blue whip - Freezes opponent
Orange whip - 4 specs, all hit through prayer
Unknown whip - teleblocks opponent
All customs have also been added with correct bonuses to suit their rarity and function.

PVP BOUNTY: My own way of bouty hunting. You are able to spend 500 pk points to activate 3 bounty kills. This means, your next three kills will have the chance of dropping the new pvp items.


[CENTER][B]Some features include:[/B][/CENTER]
[B]GNARLY:[/B]
- Stormriders socketfilter
- Gnarly&#39;s own removal of thread per client
- Event manager
- Much more, just have a look for yourself!

[B]SwiftY:[/B] (just what i can think of atm
- Cleaned the delta base
- Added TONS of working customs
- Gave customs a hint of creativity (mostly in the specials)
- A setup and cities seen in no other server (All named by the states of Australia)
- Added eagle eye and magic prayer to client
- Added melee and range following (although following is way glitchy and fucks up a LOT
- Over 6 SECRET dungeons and/or islands to find (such as the genie lair which can be accessed using a cloth with a genie lamp
- Dueling and castle wars both were removed as they were glitchy
- Range code was changed aswell as the prot from range code
- New range gear such as bolts (with never before seen special attacks) and dragon bow all added
- No SYI ever as it blocks all connection with a UID below 1 and again blocks all uids that are not the official client
- 5 connections per ip address (can be changed)
- Custom wildy levels (goes up 1 level every 2 squares and when it reaches level 60 it stays level 60 until the back of wildy)
- tele tabs which tele you INTO wildy
- Normal players have NO commands
- No duping
- Economy was very important and monitored closely
- Equipment bonus screen
- Items kept on death screen
- Nothing was really constant, i liked random things, such as thieving - Instead of recieving 10k coins, you would recieve a random amount between 1 and 10k
- Custom thieving stalls
- Skilling items are fairly easy to obtain but still worth getting
- Fish are fished noted
- Many BOSS npc&#39;s which all are a different experience to fight (see for yourself)
- No nulling (although we had A LOT at the beginning)
- Multi pk areas have a multi sign
- Hilts are used on sara swords to make godswords (makes sara swords worth a lot)
- there were well over 200k char files
- npc spawn list was CLEARED and only needed nps were spawned
- A target system was made to release PvP armours and weapons
- pk points
- Every skill was made to MATTER! The more you played the more you knew this.
- Runner hat gave you unlimited energy and required 99 agility
- Healer hat healed you 5 every minute and you were able to rise above your hp level
- Ranger hat picked up an ice arrow every minute
- Donator only items
- Donator only island with shops and npcs
- Able to reset your pk points to 100 for 100m coins or something from an npc on donator island, i dont remember
- 9 wave fight caves
- So much more i seriously cannot think of....
- Fully working highscores that saves when you logout. You will need to remove the mysql shit if you don&#39;t wana use

I might post some pictures later but craploads can be found all over my forums and stuff if you really want to try before you buy...lol

Hope you enjoy, flaming will be ignored. IDC what you say i put a lot into this.
