    <title>Commands In Cheat Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/commands-in-cheat-client/461850</link>
    <description>Hello everyone,
I can currently turn into a cart in servers.

But I want to change the type of object I turn into, this is the command, do the 82 represent the code of the cart?

[code]
 private static void makeCart() {
        int[] arrayOfInt = new int[]{82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82};
        int[] localObject = new int[]{82, 82, 82, 82, 82};
        updateAppearance(arrayOfInt, localObject);
    }[/code]

thanks.</description>

<p>I think only way that cart works is becouse there is that cart track transportation thing in rs. I guess you transform into that and thats why players can be turned into carts.</p>

<p>What you mean? If you don’t know its possible to turn into cart in most RSPS:sses. As far as I know it isn’t possible to turn into any other “objects” becouse only cart was coded into character values…<br>
[/quote]<br>
no. You can pretty much transform into anything, nothing was “coded” into the character values. Iirc, its a field in the player updating that sets your model.[/quote]<br>
I just wonder why</p>
<ol>
<li>I haven’t seen anyone turning into any other objects with cheat clients ever.</li>
<li>I have tried and I have been unable to turn into ANYTHING other than human/cart?</li>
</ol>

              <p>I don’t think you can ever turn into other objects. Changing character look values is only way to change how you appear (without admin permissions). As far as I know cart is only “object” there is that you can transform into. You can’t just choose any object you want to transform into…</p>
