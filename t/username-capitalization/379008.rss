    <description>Everytime a new player logs in, a new character file is created. But, every character that was suppossed to be capitalized is lower case.

For example: &quot;Mod Hershey&quot; is shown as &quot;mod hershey&quot; in the character file.

So, when that player uses the clan chat or yell, it shows the name in lower case and looks bad.


Does anyone know how to get the server to save character names as they were originally typed in when they first logged in?


EDIT: I went into the character file and changed the name of the file and the &quot;username&quot; part of the file to the capitalized version, &quot;Mod Hershey&quot;. But when I log in, it still says &quot;mod hershey has logged in.&quot; and any other messages or anywhere it uses the username its lower case even though the character file is capitalized.</description>

              <p>Um, if you’re using PI then open Rs2LoginProtocolDecoder.java (…PI\src\server\net) and import this if it isn’t there already:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">import server.util.Misc;</code></pre>
<p>Then find:</p>
