    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/putting-in-your-form/224500</link>
    <description>okay, i thoguht SCAR was only for macros and crap. then after doing mroe research,i figured out u can create full programs. i discovered this fter messing around with SCAR paint. so, i edit my form and stuff, but i dont know how to add commands to certain things like 1 button or something. i do this in C++. C++, Delphi, and sorta VB6 was to tough for me. and i figured out about SCAR, and thoguht it would be good to begin in. so, i would really like to know this. thanks!</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>To detect if a button is clicked, then you’ll need to add something, like this, at the end of your button setting up area:<code>
Button1.OnClick := @ProcedureHere;</code></p>
<p>Replace ProcedureHere with your procedure. However, your procedure must contain the following parametres:<code>
(Sender: TObject);</code></p>
<p>So, it might look something like:[code]<br>
procedure ClickingProcedure(Sender: TObject);  //Focus here.<br>
begin<br>
Writeln(‘Button has been clicked/pressed.’);<br>
end;</p>
<p>procedure Form1;<br>
begin<br>
Button1.OnClick:=@ClickingProcedure;  //And Focus here.<br>
end;[/code]</p>
<p>Well, there you go, if you need more support, please post here <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Do you mean changing the captions of the buttons and stuff you make with the form editor? i do not quite understand.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Label1 := TLabel.Create(RCtest);
Label1.Parent := RCtest;
Label1.Left := 8;
Label1.Top := 16;
Label1.Width := 51;
Label1.Height := 13;
Label1.Caption := 'ThisISTest';</code></pre>
<p>If you wanted to change the caption in this code you would simple go to where is says ‘Label1.Caption := ‘ThisISTest’;’ and change the text there. Pretty straightfoward.</p>
