    <title>28 Weeks Later</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/28-weeks-later/168767</link>
    <description>Yesterday, I rented the movie of 28 Weeks Later. If your asking why I didn&#39;t see it in the theaters my answer is this: Screw it. Too many dipshits being assholes so you can&#39;t hear whats going on.

All in all, it was a great movie. If you have not seen it, and you like horror stuff, I would recommend it to you.


[b][i][u]SPOILER BELOW[/u][/i][/b]
[size=4pt]It goes like this. There is a disease called &#39;Rage&#39; that goes around an makes people into zombie-like things. They go around biting people and killing them and making them infected. 28 weeks later, the last of the people with &#39;Rage&#39; die out, and the non-infected people decide to build a new city and let people in slowly. There are 2 kids that arrive into the city, meet there dad and find out how their mother died. So, they want to be dopey and go to the place where the military don&#39;t let them go. They find their mother, not attacking them, but with &#39;Rage&#39; in her. The military come in and get the mother into a place to maybe try to find a cure, and the children get put into a cell-like place so they don&#39;t escape again. The father comes in and the children start yelling that they want to see their mother. So the father becomes a dopey idiot and goes into the place where their mother is kept in and starts to kiss his wife.(NOTE, RAGE GETS TRANSFERED FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER FROM BITING THEM OR THE PERSONS SALIVA)He gets infected with rage, kills his wife, and goes killing guards.................can&#39;t be bothered to type the rest...anyway, it ends up the 2 kids are the only ones alive (and a few military people) at the end. ALL THE KIDS FAULT.[/size]</description>

“Well, I didn’t want to do the second one, because I was involved in “Sunshine.” But I went out and I helped them [with 28 Weeks Later]. I did some second-unit shooting on it. And I really enjoyed it, actually. There’s something about doing something trashy that’s great. Where basically you just come in the door and you just kill them. That was rather refreshing.”<br>
— Danny Boyle on directing.[33]</p>
<p>In March 2007, Boyle announced plans to create a “third chapter” of the film franchise, which may be given the title 28 Months Later with a 2009 release date,[34] thus creating a trilogy. Boyle has stated that his thoughts are to set the movie in Russia.[35]</p>
<p>In June 2007, it was announced that if DVD sales of the film did well Fox Atomic would consider producing the third film.[36]</p>
<p>In July 2007, while promoting the film Sunshine, Boyle revealed that he has a story formulating for the next film “There is an idea for the next one, something which would move [the story] on. I’ve got to think about it, whether it’s right or not.” Boyle also revealed that he would return as the director.[37]</p>

<p>I did like this movie, although I liked 28 Days Later equally, since that had a hint of mysteriousness…  davidude36, I hope 28 Months Later comes too.  That would be hard to direct though, by then wouldn’t the whole of Europe, Africa and Asia be consumed by the disease?  Right enough, they do die of starvation after what 25 weeks or something?</p>

28 days later - 9/10 (towards the end it became dragging and hard to tell what was going on)<br>

[size=4pt]It goes like this. There is a disease called ‘Rage’ that goes around an makes people into zombie-like things. They go around biting people and killing them and making them infected. 28 weeks later, the last of the people with ‘Rage’ die out, and the non-infected people decide to build a new city and let people in slowly. There are 2 kids that arrive into the city, meet there dad and find out how their mother died. So, they want to be dopey and go to the place where the military don’t let them go. They find their mother, not attacking them, but with ‘Rage’ in her. The military come in and get the mother into a place to maybe try to find a cure, and the children get put into a cell-like place so they don’t escape again. The father comes in and the children start yelling that they want to see their mother. So the father becomes a dopey idiot and goes into the place where their mother is kept in and starts to kiss his wife.(NOTE, RAGE GETS TRANSFERED FROM ONE PERSON TO ANOTHER FROM BITING THEM OR THE PERSONS SALIVA)He gets infected with rage, kills his wife, and goes killing guards…can’t be bothered to type the rest…anyway, it ends up the 2 kids are the only ones alive (and a few military people) at the end. ALL THE KIDS FAULT.[/size]</p>
