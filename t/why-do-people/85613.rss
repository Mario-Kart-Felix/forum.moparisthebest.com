    <title>Why do people</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-do-people/85613</link>
    <description>Why do people call JaGeX ignorant fags and things like that?  Only real reason I can find is that they have successfully made a really good game in Java and are making millions from it, or maybe it&#39;s the fact that these guys are really smart, and you are just jealous?

I understand that some people do not like the game runescape, but why insult the creators of such a successful game?

Well, this isn&#39;t really a rant or anything, I&#39;m just really curious, why do you all call them fags and gay and shit?</description>

<p>Actually, rs graphics where made bad on purpose. WurmOnline is a java game and look at that.</p>

<p>Farming actually reduces the ridiculous price for prayer pots so us “old timers” can spend 1-2 hours at black demons, but oh look, a week in pest control is 500 million gold in prayer pots, and 2-3 weeks at greater demons.</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what’s ruining the game, the shit graphics updates, except for lumby, 11 yr old kids on the game with a 13 yr old limit and freaking chicken suits. I thought the rubber chicken was cool, so did a few friends of mine, zombie heads was pretty good too, scarfs and wooly hats was also cool, egg ring was stupid as it makes the rock ring obsolete, and I didn’t even bother getting the chicken suit.</p>
<p>Jagex want the game to be a fun, safe environment for us to play, some people like the old stuff(me), some people with a mental health disorder that can’t spell like the new buildings, and since there are more people joining the game than old timers staying, the obvious choice would be to keep the new ones happy and fuck the old timers over.</p>
<p>Also, what’s up with the new quests? One every two weeks, one time last year I had every quest done, now I have 1/3 done and more quest points than 1/3 of the RS players, I don’t know what fucking armor is suppose to be good now, I could just stick with barrows but that’s ridiculous to gain unless you spend enough time on RS to know what the hell’s suppose to be good any more.</p>
<p>I joined members roughly a week before the Elemental Workshop quest, before the white line around items when you click them and all the fancy new stuff, it was good back then, with the only problem being, getting Jagex to hear you. Now they don’t listen and simply guess what people want rather than asking them. [/rant]</p>
<p>PS: Old fashion faldor was way better than the new soap-brick city that it is today.</p>

              <p>Why do people call JaGeX ignorant fags and things like that?  Only real reason I can find is that they have successfully made a really good game in Java and are making millions from it, or maybe it’s the fact that these guys are really smart, and you are just jealous?</p>
<p>I understand that some people do not like the game runescape, but why insult the creators of such a successful game?</p>
<p>Well, this isn’t really a rant or anything, I’m just really curious, why do you all call them fags and gay and shit?</p>
