    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;We would like to remind everyone to NEVER enter their password into the RuneScape chat. Not for ANY reason! In an attempt to better protect our players&#39; passwords, we&#39;ve updated the game to [b]prevent you from saying any sentence which contain your exact password[/b]. This is only a basic check, however, and it&#39;s still [b]extremely unsafe to type your password[/b] into the chat, so please DON&#39;T try it out to see! That would be foolish and extremely dangerous.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Omfg those retards, now ALOT of noobs might think that the filter is 100% sure and keep saying their password, but if there&#39;s even a small hole Jagex is in shit since they don&#39;t know who lost their account really or who is a liar. Also, the lvl 3 people can now actually say that &quot;Jagex blocks your password, look ******!&quot;</description>

If you are not, please change your password to something more obscure!”</p>
