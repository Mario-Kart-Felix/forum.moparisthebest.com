    <title>Dedication</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dedication/219713</link>
    <description>I am not sure if this is in the right place if not please notify me.

Ok well I have decided to get my server dedicated but I do not know where to buy the program or how to use it.

If anyone knows an answer to either of these with a link or something let me know.

By the way just so everyone knows (like the rules say) I have looked for one and have found a couple but when i click on by it asks for a wesite   :(

Not sure how to make it run the server.

              <p>Well first off chris lol…No its not just buying a new computer. It is buying a program or something to run the server for you 24/7 and if you don’t have a computer with big enough memory you might want dedication.</p>

              <p>Ehm, no advertising in the help section… Also getting a server dedicated can cost serious amounts of cash per month, if your willing to pay that then go for it by why would you want to get a source dedicated when you can just leave an auto restarter on per hour and have your server 24\7?</p>
