    <title>By far the best RS2 server source released?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/by-far-the-best-rs2-server-source-released/94502</link>
    <description>What is it? I disappear from the scene for one year and now everybody has a source that&#39;s supposedly 100x more unique than the next guy, which brings my question which is the best up for download now? The most complete, realistic RuneScape 2 source out there.. I haven&#39;t even used RS2 sources since the only thing you could do was use a dummy to train your attack :D, and the next time after that there was some random NPC spawns and what not, very glitched pking, but nothing too too big.

And are RS2 servers (that are realistic anyway), even close to completion? Places like varrock, edgeville, and such with the right monsters? I&#39;d just like a source made by someone with a realistic intent, to look and try it out. I&#39;m hoping they are mostly complete :D

Thanks in advance if anyone finds me a source, I just can&#39;t do it because there is about 100 sources, but in my mind it seems like most of the kids posting the link probably just changed the name and added a new NPC coordinate, or something stupid like that.

<p>I agree 100%, and people only answer the noobs questions because they are easy. Not too many people have the kind of knowledge to answer good questions.</p>
<p>EDIT: Anyone who wants to go on about “learn java you noob!”, there is little you need to know about java to “code” (I hate using that term) private servers. Back when I first started, I didn’t know a damn thing, and I still made a good server.</p>

<p>Who ever said anything about me having no coding skills lol? I coded my own PHP back end to a server along time ago where people basically had to sign up on the website like RuneScape, and my server use to have 10+ on daily until I got DoSed or whatever the hell its called. I can copy my PM to mopar if you want me to.</p>

<p>People put up sources to get others prepared for their server, so they don’t have to write the whole server out. I don’t see every server being the same. It’s called EDITING, if you’ve heard of it. Also, they want it as a challenge, to see if their server is Number 1 or not.</p>
<p>If you don’t understand JAVA, then it’s pointless that you get a server. You will go nowhere with it, it will just be a copy of another server. You won’t be able to do jack----.[/quote]</p>
<p>Again, nowhere have I once said I knew nothing about JAVA. You’d think by my use of terminology I’d have some background on it. But na, guess not. And I’m sure any mod here can agree with me MANY people do “so called editting” by simply removing a few lines and renaming the server… good job? They can change a string?!! They must be PRO JAVA.</p>
<p>People get so defensive when I made a point that 90% of the people here couldn’t code a server from the scratch, and I’m sure anybody could agree. Everybody’s been working from a base source, excepts the gods who released them. And why is people “hoo tipe lik zis” get better help and less flaming then me? Do you prefer helping ten year olds who cry WHUTS JAVAC over me with a simple question all day? Eh, guess so.</p>
<p>But for the people who were intermediate, I remember there was always a few base sources people chose from before they got too work, which is why I am asking, (as i’ve been rudely denied), what’s todays CHOICE of a server source to work with (that is advanced).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Here’s my advice. It doesn’t matter what source you use, as long as YOU can turn it into a good one. If you use something like ZdiddyScape, which is the most known server, people will say that you are a counterfeit. It’s up to YOU to code your server.</p>

</aside>
<p>Why is there even sources being released in the first place then? Based on what you say. Yeah, how about we all dedicate ourselves to a career in Java, and make our own RuneScapes. Right. It’s up to me to code my own server? Kid I’m aware that it is up to me to do whatever the hell I please, with in mind the consequences of such said actions being made. So by me coding my own server, I’m assuming you mean go with the crowd, and just add a few more pointless cases, if/else statements etc that have a minimal effect on the goal of RS2 private servers (which is why they are getting no where, and which is why I can not find an advanced source). Cause I know 90% of the people here couldn’t code such a thing from scratch, there WAS a day, when somebody released the whole idea for the people to build upon. Which is why I am asking, what is the latest, and greatest, source to build upon.</p>
<p>Thanks. And P-Diddy sucks, I wouldn’t want my server named after him.</p>

I disappear from the scene for one year and now everybody has a source that’s supposedly 100x more unique than the next guy, which brings my question which is the best up for download now? The most complete, realistic RuneScape 2 source out there… I haven’t even used RS2 sources since the only thing you could do was use a dummy to train your attack :D, and the next time after that there was some random NPC spawns and what not, very glitched pking, but nothing too too big.</p>
<p>And are RS2 servers (that are realistic anyway), even close to completion? Places like varrock, edgeville, and such with the right monsters? I’d just like a source made by someone with a realistic intent, to look and try it out. I’m hoping they are mostly complete <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Thanks in advance if anyone finds me a source, I just can’t do it because there is about 100 sources, but in my mind it seems like most of the kids posting the link probably just changed the name and added a new NPC coordinate, or something stupid like that.</p>
<p>Ty.</p>
