              <p>Basically what is happening is RuneScape is developing so much quicker than the children that program here can develop themselfs. I know i’m not a bgreat coder, But i do try and i feel like i progress every time i try something new, Which i get the feeling none of these other children do.</p>
<p>These people need to realise that what Jagex are doing is killing there game, And then when people try and bring jagex’s updates to rsps its killing our community.</p>
<p>We need to step back and think about what really makes a good server and what doesn’t.</p>
<p>I’m sure 90% of you would agree that sticking a bunch of shit into a game that doesnt belong there ruins the feel of it and makes us not want to play.</p>
<p>Its like jagex putting an AK47 into RuneScape. would totally ruin the med-evil theme. Just like us, I’ve been through some servers in my time and the customs are just awful and they really ruin what could be a good server.</p>

<p>True of course but in my opinion a lot of Rsps doesn’t require a high level of Java.

I’m not good at either but thats what it seems like to me.</p>

<p>I don’t know a great deal of java, But i know about the variables within the server and i know how to implement them and manipulate to do what i want.</p>
<p>RSPS programming isn’t difficult, it just requires you to put your mind to it.</p>

<p>What love said is true, the base can only be as good as the programmer makes it.<br>
But my hypothosis why this site is dying is because in the early days there wasn’t nearly as much content out there and people that tried to develope it generally had previous knowledge however as time has gone on people without the knowledge want to start doing Rsps and sites like these have bad teaching in my opinion.<br>
People with the knowledge generally don’t teach in terms people like me can understand without learning outside of Rsps. I’m lucky that I’m learning Java atm but I feel my attempts at learning Rsps over the past 3 years have failed hard in comparison to what I have elarned in the past 2 months of actual education.<br>
The new people that join this site generally are novices, mean responses to them make them leave so the people joining this site has obiously been seeing a decrease in people joining.<br>
Site needs to change so that people can change.<br>

Exactly. And people should learn some JAVA, even if it means taking a basic class on JAVA, just so you get a feel of what your doing. You cant expect someone to know how to do calculus, if they don’t know simple math.[/quote]<br>

<p>I’ve noticed everyone that was once great, The best coders that this site has seen, are getting banned. And people that have no concept of JAVA are taking their spot, which is slowly turning this site into a low form of entertainment for most good programmers.[/quote]Completely agreed, I’ve seen so many great programmers get banned, in fact, I’m about to be banned. It’s not a matter of if, but when, I get banned - I hope someone of decent knowledge will fill my spot and MoparScape will forget about me entirely.</p>

<p>Exactly. When I first started on this site, people had more common sense and knowledge, now, years later, its like 11 year olds that cant read a simple compile error message.</p>
