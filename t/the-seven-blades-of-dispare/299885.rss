    <title>The Seven Blades of Dispare</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-seven-blades-of-dispare/299885</link>
    <description>I am currently working on something, originally, I just wanted to make a simple sword but i ended up with this. Please suggest some colors, or textures, and a name. :) Also, I want this weapon to hit like u have no weapon at all, like punching, how would I do that? Or is here a better attacking animation?

Pics:
Fits nice and snug on his arm.

Just another view.

I kinda want him to wield it like a sword, but if there is another better way to wield it, please suggest it :)

PLEASE IF YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS TELL ME!

*This was made 100% on my own, no other pictures used, 100% primitives.*
*Please suggest below!*
*Took me about 40 or 50 mins to do. I could probably re-create this in a matter of minutes tho.*

EDIT1: Maybe I should make him wield it in both hands :o
EDIT2: I think it should attack normally like the Rune Claws special attack, but I don&#39;t know how to do it, can some one help please?</description>

Dylan most likely doesnt, otherwise he would mention it. He is a fairly honest person to my knowledge.</p>
<p>EDIT - i suggest, making it run from a primitive circle, instead of his wrist. And in the middel of a prim circle use a prim cylinder for a handle, and make it kinda like that, I say this because i done believe datmaker will animate this correctly, to how it needs</p>
