    <description>[CENTER]Hello Everyone

This is probably the wrong section, although I don&#39;t know where this should be put elsewhere.

I am LangKampo, 15 years old, I live in The Netherlands.
I started messing around with RSPS when I was 10, so you could say I&#39;m quite experienced. I started along with my IRL bud, we created multiple servers. LiquidX was by far my best project (667 loading 728)

(The banner below, while running &quot;LiquidX2&quot; (637/639)

(I am also a grahpics designer!)

But as of now, I realise that I don&#39;t want to be running a server as the main owner. I love to administrate, handle problems, donations, help people with &quot;not working&quot; clients as I am good with PC issues, I love to moderate ingame, hangout ingame, pretty much everything to do with RSPS. I also love to be administrative on forums. I&#39;m pretty experienced with PHP, vBulletin, and such. 

So, as you could guess allready, I am looking for a community to join as staff.
This is the information I guess that could be useful for owners/admins:
- I live in The Netherlands
- Timezone GMT+1
- I am in school, but very active outside school, even AFK, still responding
- I speak Dutch, English, a bit of German and can understand some french
- Always in mood for helping, even with things that ain&#39;t my job

I would like to join a server as one of the following ranks, which really needs to be done, as I like to work to see a server growing and run perfectly.
- Game Moderator
- Forum Administrator
- Game Administrator
- Game Administrator+ (Help with developing when you need me, I am pretty experienced with it)
- Game Developer (I don&#39;t prefer this ATM because I didn&#39;t work with anything above 667 yet)

I really hope someone needs me and can use my help.

You can contact me here on Mopar via Thread OR PM. Or at the following services:
