    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/opensite-command-pi/452352</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i have a quick question.

Can someone please give me the code for ::openwebsite command?

Here&#39;s what i want the command to do:

Say if i want a player to open a website, i want a command that will force them to open a website.

E.G

::forcevote john

if i did ::forcevote playername, it would force the player to open my voting website...

is there any way of doing such a command?</description>

              <p>No, i already have commands that open sites for the players that type them (E.G ::vote)</p>
<p>What i’m after is a command i can do, that forces a player to open a website.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Mod Ace uses command:<br>
::readthis Johnpkz</p>
<p>A website opens for Johnpkz.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the ::vote command i use for my PI server:<br>
<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=461508.0" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=461508.0</a></p>
<p>Now, you’ll notice that he goes on to explain that you can make a command that opens a site for all online players:</p>
<p>[quote=“Uncalled, post:1, topic:365303”][center][shadow=red,left][size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">All Online Players Website</span></span>[/size][/shadow][/center]<br>
And if you’d like a command that will open the voting website for every online player in the game.<br>
Open your Commands.java file and add this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">			if (playerCommand.equals("Vote") &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
				for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++)
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
						Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
						c2.getPA().sendFrame126("voting site here", 12000);
					}
			}</code></pre>
<p>This is basically the same thing, only it’ll open the site you choose for every player in the game.<br>
This part,</p>
<p><code>for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++)
					if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
						Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];</code><br>
That gets it to be for every player who is online to take them to the website of your choice.<br>
And this, ‘&amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {’ makes it to only where the owner can type the command you make.<br>
And ‘c2.getPA().sendFrame126(“voting site here”, 12000);’ is basically the same thing as the command above, for the single player.<br>
The only difference is that the ‘c2’ part, if you don’t have the ‘c2’ before this command, then you’ll get an error.</p>
<p>And also same thing for this code too.<br>
Leave the ‘http://’ out of the website address.<br>
Example:</p>
<p><code>
            if (playerCommand.equals("Vote") &amp;&amp; c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
                for (int j = 0; j &lt; Server.playerHandler.players.length; j++)
                    if (Server.playerHandler.players[j] != null) {
                        Client c2 = (Client)Server.playerHandler.players[j];
                        c2.getPA().sendFrame126("www.google.com", 12000);
                    }
            }
</code>[/quote]</p>
<p>What i want to do is make a command that opens a website for a single player of my choice (::opensite JohnPkz).</p>

<p>People are so desperate for success that they’re now forcing their players to vote? I’m sorry, but this is just out of hand. Add it client-sided and let them do it themselves. If they like your work and want it to be successful - they’ll vote.<br>

<p>Dude! I never said i actually wanted to force people to vote, i was giving an example.<br>
Say if i want someone to go to a specific news post on the forum.</p>
<p>::newsread john</p>
<p>it would open the website/postlink for john.</p>
<p>Come on seriously i need help![/quote]</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if (String.equals(""))
    openSite("www.oracle.com");</code></pre>
<p>You won’t have this method client-sided. Find your Client’s way of launching a URL.</p>
