    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/fresh-computer/426909</link>
    <description>Basically I&#39;ve tried googling, and nothing helpful came up.

Whats the best way to completely get my computer to factory new that I can do MYSELF.

Because its been running super slow lately, and I just need a nice (new) factory OS on it.</description>

You’re computer isn’t strapped down to 1 OS, there are certain requirements that your computer needs to meet for certain OS, but if your computer is running Vista, I am 90% sure you can upgrade to 7 without problems. All 7 is, a fixed and better version of Vista. Windows itself is not a good OS, and for the people saying “XP is the best!” No it isn’t. Xp was releast in 2001. That OS is going on 11 years old. Technology advances so fast now a days, XP is considered in my book “Ancient”. I would recommend Torrenting Windows 7 and installing that. IF your computer is reliable I would recommend turning your computer into a Hackintosh. That’s if your computer is compatible. Mac is harder to do Java things, but ry60003333 has mastered it. He is the RSPS/Mac King.<br>

<p>In case your incompetent ass didn’t know… There’s 3 different versions of XP. Theres the original, 1997, the 2001, then 2003, and at last 2007.

Yet, but PC thats running XP 2007, runs flawlessly, with tons of games, barley any RAM and a amazing graphics card, a graphics card isn’t really what I would call affecting speed, RAM etc etc does.</p>

<p>I was clearly saying XP and Vista are crap, get 7 if you are staying with Windows.</p>

<p>this is quite true, any computer hardwired to vista would probably not function at all. He may be referring to OEM though. If he tried to install an OEM product as his new operating system then obviously he’d make that assumption.</p>

Download CCleaner after you rebuild your operating system. This CCleaner device should have a free-space wiper, change it to 7 complex overpasses and let it run all night. This will completely remove any trace of your old computer system.</p>

He said his computer was built for Vista, so it’s not going to support 7 or xp. My current one is built for 7 and when I try to install xp I get blue screened because the computer can’t support the packages that xp uses.</p>

 lemme_winks_:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>i never said they didn’t?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s pretty common knowledge, if you knew everyone knows about this type of OS why would you go around implying people use it if the thought of using it must have already crossed their mind and been pushed out of the way in the first place?</p>
<p>Second quote:</p>
<aside class="quote quote-modified" data-post="14" data-topic="426909">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 lemme_winks_:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>…because suggesting free, open-source, popular software isn’t smart.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well now you are just being a smart ass too. I was implying that you are trying to be a know it all by talking higher of yourself for using this operating system.</p>
<p>Third quote:</p>
<p>[quote=“lemme_winks_, post:14, topic:426909”]^ he wants a new OS.<br>
you are suggesting torrenting windows.  very unethical for such an intelligent man like yourself.[/quote]<br>
A new factory OS means that he wants to install the OS that came with his PC. How could you not get that one? He even states before that his computer is built for vista. Torrenting an operating system that you already own is in no way illegal, that is the only reason ISO’s of operating systems, dvds, and video games are not taken down from online. All sites that host these claim that you must own the software to download the torrents or face legal problems. Again, learn your facts first. At least read the topic if you are going to make any type of rebuttal to my comments.</p>
<p>Fourth quote:</p>
<p>[quote=“lemme_winks_, post:14, topic:426909”]the people who make distros go by the what GNU believes.  mac PCs are over-priced and just nice to look at.  free developers are the ones helping the world, not big corporations like microsoft and businessmen like bill gates and that apple faggot.</p>
<p>getting smarter and making everything better.  it’s a +/+, man.[/quote]<br>
I was talking about the way you are pushing it on him, that has nothing to relate to the cost what so ever. Guess what, reading is a +/+ too.</p>
<p>Fifth quote:</p>

</aside>
<p>I was thinking quite the same thing when I first saw your posts.</p>
<p>Sixth quote:<br>
<em>See Fifth quote reply</em></p>
<p>Seventh quote:</p>
<p>[quote=“lemme_winks_, post:14, topic:426909”]this was rather rude.  i was helping.  if he keeps using windows, it’ll just happen again and again.</p>
<p>ps: i’ll be sure to break my fingers before EVER talking about linux/GNU around you again![/quote]<br>
Yes, it was rather rude, I save that for people who quite annoy me. You may see that I never go around calling people “fags” “dicks” “douche bags” or many of the other colorful words this forum seems to just love keeping in their arsenal but ever so often I see someone deserving of my low key terms for implying this to you.</p>
<p>ps: That would be lovely.</p>

<p>ps: don’t illegally torrent software[/quote]<br>
Everyone knows about Linux software here. Stop trying to act smart by pushing stuff on other people, he just wants to fix his current operating system. My god stop ruining Linux based systems by acting like mac users “Hey you should really use so and so, it’s so much better.” The reason Linux systems were so good for so long is because not everyone knew about it but now people like you use it and try to act all cool cause you are in a small majority of people which is actually a lot larger now because you have occupied it with your hipster friends. Seriously, shut up.</p>

Vista is terrible as Hell though.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the torrent (estimation 1-2 hours)</li>
<li>Download PowerISO</li>
<li>When the torrent download is complete, extract the files with PowerISO (open the files up first, there should be files in there, just copy and paste them inside a folder or wanted destination)</li>
<li>Allow them to extract, and once done, click on the installation process application</li>
<li>Allow it to what it needs</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m sure you know what you’re requirements are and what bit number you have, the rest of the time after those steps, it’ll do it itself.</p>

You have to burn an install disk then put it in and remove the old operating system first, then install it.<br>

Now… if I would have to do that… I would never do that because I don’t have the patience to do that so… of course he doesn’t have to do that.  :P[/quote]My computer is only Vista compatible (which I’d rather have).</p>
