    <description>If you wonder why the story has such a crappy title &#39;Laura&#39; there are reasons.
We have to write a story and the commentate on it meaning you can write the most amazing story but get an E because you make a shit commentary. You also have to base your story somewhat off another (mine was lightly based on &#39;maria&#39;, hence the story title)

Im having trouble with the commentary which is basically an analysis of your story. I hate literature.

Rep for valued feedback...
Merci.

Story
&lt;blockquote&gt;Laura
A cruel October wind howled as hailstones hammered hard on the surface of the car. Nothing could be seen through the windows except a silver sheet of running water and the occasional glimpse of the outside when the water was swept aside by window wipers. The window glass rattled violently in warning that it could shatter in moments, catapulting her into the depths of oblivion. She would be lost to eternity, floating in nothingness, floating in a vacuum screaming with no sound emerging, dwelling on the fact that there was no-one to come and no-one to care.

‘Out. Go to the house over there but don’t go in.’ her aunt, Ms Margaret commanded. It was like she was being told to ‘walk the plank’, staring into a death-pit knowing that if she did not go into it, she would be made to.  Hesitating as much as she dared but on receiving no evidence of reconsidering such a heartless request, she wrapped her arms tightly around a small brown bear with half eaten paws, her pillar of strength and braced for the outside.

Pushing through the wind and hail, young Laura pressed herself hard against the door in hope of some sort of protection. In the window a fire shone bright like Christmas in the cold clutches of winter. Images of her and her mother reading by the fire on a cold afternoon flickered in the flames. It was almost as if she could reach out and feel her, that her Mother was in the fire granting it warmth beyond physical heat. The images vaporised immediately when her aunt came swaying and staggering unsteadily up the path. After three attempts of actually pushing the door bell, someone answered it. 

‘June! Long time no see. I don’t wish to stay long.’ Ms Margaret said.
‘Its Joan.’ replied the lady, shaking hands with Ms Margaret and then looking upon Laura. ‘Laura is it? Your room’s upstairs on the right. Ms Margaret, let us discuss finance!’.

Laura was told she had this room to herself, because she ‘was special’ and thus was not required to share with other ‘orphans’. This of course meant ‘Your aunt has paid extra so you will not be staying with them’. Ms Margaret was generally a very well respected member of the community who owned a small but inherited business. Primarily the business should have gone to Laura and her mother when her grandfather died however, with no mother; next of kin was Aunt Margaret. Aunt Margaret’s outside image was a mask well worn. She was always seen well dressed, fierce but one for talking kindly to homeless beggars and giving them loose change. Laura however knew her true aunt. The one who would pass out drunk before lunch-time. The one who would wallop you one for not moving out the way in less than three seconds. The one who would hit you because you disturbed her beauty sleep; the one no-one ever saw.

The room she stood in would have been satisfactory were it not for the white bars on the window which she assured herself were for protection, not confinement. The walls were painted a dusty cream, complimented by an old, thin holey carpet which revealed grey floor boards beneath, splattered with drops of paint. Someone could not afford a good painter she grinned to herself and deciding she would make both her mother and Jean proud by redecorating it after breakfast.

On arrival to the dining room the next morning, all other household members were sitting straight, tall and silent around the table with breakfast already laid out. It was nice to see others in the same parentless position as she. To break the harsh silence, innocently, Laura picked up her spoon to eat.
‘Oi, say Grace first.’ the eldest, Miranda shouted. ‘What you doing? You thank God for food he gives. Just because you new, don’t mean you’re special.’
For such a minute thing, poor Laura felt immensely ashamed and embarrassed. She resulted to hiding in her room for the rest of the day holding tight her bear and awaiting to see if anyone would come and inform her when dinner was ready. When no-one did she realised they felt her shame was her own doing which resulting in her feeling worse.

After Laura’s second attempt at breakfast, she now felt it was time to paint her room in hope of getting on the good side of her new guardian. She covered the room in blue, building upon it a beautiful beach. Crabs were smiling; seaweed lay deserted in the waters; birds were drawn not in the usual V shape, but in fine detail. Laura’s bear was held in one hand bearing with the same half-eaten paws. In the other hand she held ice cream. Behind her, her Mother stood smiling with her hands wrapped around Laura. Stepping back, she admired her masterpiece feeling proud. Joan now stood in the doorway with a complete contrast of expression and within seconds, extinguished all Laura’s hope of ever being happy here. Before the words ‘Surprise’ left Laura’s lips, she was locked in a new room to once again feeling lost, hungry and longing for care. 

Her eye lids felt heavy the next morning but not with sleepiness. Carelessness sank in for whenever she tried to do something good she failed, so why bother? Joan came in and Laura merely groaned when requested to move. Curiously, Joan felt Laura’s head and observed her for indication of illness. With a final suspicious look she returned with medication. On giving them to her, she caught sight of the small teddy bear with a look of disgust. Its half eaten paws, it’s dust, it’s murky brown sticky fur and black marble eyes. There was nothing that could have been done. No matter how much Laura clung to it, tried to cover it, screamed, shouted, punched and kicked and fought with every breath, her best friend was stolen with the sole conclusion that it was the cause of her illness. In all the fighting, the medication lay forgotten by Joan but in mind and next to Laura.

Throughout out the day, Laura lay staring at the ceiling empty, lost and helpless. There was no one left, no family, no friends. All had been unfairly stolen from her and no physical power she held could bring them back. She regretted everything that was not her fault, blamed herself for not having the power to protect her bear friend, the only thing that had been with her though all time. She blamed herself for not being able to save her mother in the car crash; blamed herself for being abandoned by her aunt, for not being good enough. Thoughts and emotions whirled inside, each one rotting, spreading and attacking her, a disease that could not be cured for the only cure there was, was impossible.

The tablets on the side began to look friendlier with each passing minute. A gateway to freedom, the door to the next realm, salvation, love and every tiny little thing she wanted. What was there to live for after all? Everything was gone. No dreams, ambition, friends or hope. The only dream she held was to see her mother again. 

Her mind and body shook as she downed the entire packet of tablets. Half of her shook with fear and doubt. Half shook with nerves and excitement. Had she taken the right choice? Would she see that of which she wished so deep? There was no going back.

Feeling dizzy and longing for the fresh freedom of air she tiptoed downstairs, every step pausing to listen for noises. Little now stood between her and the door of freedom except a now highly distinguishable small shadow seen in the window of the door. Opening the letterbox, she looked up and peered into the figures eyes whilst hearing her name being softly whispered. Repeatedly looking back and fourth torn between curiosity and reason she ignored what had been bred into her. Never open the door to strangers. Something about this figure however was bounding, scary but relieving all at once.

Falling to her knees she stared up with horror at her mum standing like an angel in silver moonlight.
‘You coming?’ she whispered softly.
Without taking her eyes off her, without even asking where she had been all this time, if she was real. Without thought, she took her mothers hand and disappeared into the night. No longer motherless.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of commentary.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Commentary 
‘’Laura’ is a story derived from that of ‘Maria’ written by Elizabeth Bowen in Modern Short Stories Two. Both share similar themes such as abandonment, orphan hood, character relationships and unreliable narrators.
Both ‘Laura’ and ‘Maria’ share similar situations and characteristics while each still unique in their own way. Both are motherless who suffer abandonment and loneliness however whereas Maria seeks revenge and blames all others, Laura is in contrast and blames herself. Pathos is consequently generated as is a bond with both reader and character.

The narrator uses 3rd person omnipotent which is used to give indication that they could also have been in a similar situation because the narrator thus knows how Laura is feeling without her speaking it(which can show understanding). The aunt is described by the narrator as ‘swaying and staggering unsteadily’; the sibilance shows something sinister or secretive of the character and also the narrators dislike. The narrator also evidently sympathises with the Laura as adjectives of Laura such as ‘poor’, ‘young’ are used and also the ad-verb ‘innocently’ which is used to demonstrate the punishment Laura inflicts on herself is too harsh. If the narrator is against the aunt but pathetic towards Laura we could therefore deem them biased or untrustworthy since we may not be getting the full side of the story. 

Throughout the story, no direct speech is given to Laura; all her thoughts and feelings are heard through the narrator meaning the narrator has full control over the reader. Laura is suppressed by family and even the narrator which solidifies the idea of Laura’s helplessness and loneliness. It is also another example of unreliable narration. 

The opening paragraph uses strong images of pathetic fallacy and alliteration to build a picture in the readers head.  to reflect the characters inner thoughts and feelings. It is also used to show how a character deals with a gloomy situation, for  example in the ‘cruel October wind’ weather we can deem that

Whenever Laura feels insecure, she tends to wrap ‘her arms tightly around a small brown bear’ which shows the bear symbolises her insecurities and hence marks her biggest downfall when her ‘pillar of strength’ is removed. The fire symbolises her hopes and is compared to ‘Christmas in the cold clutches of winter’&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
