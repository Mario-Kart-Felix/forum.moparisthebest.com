    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-and-evil/537246</link>
    <description>-not sure if there is already a thread for this-

Does Good and evil actually exist? Or is it rather a false preconception? I do believe that morality depends on what type of environment an individual&#39;s exposed to;or someone&#39;s mental state. So, who or what exactly determines what&#39;s right or wrong?

Thoughts?</description>

<p>Very true. I read somewhere before he died, Kim Jong il had people believe he invented the hamburger, he was the best golfer in the world, his military fashion sense has influenced world wide, and that he does not urinate or defecate… Propoganda in NK is strong.</p>
<p>back on topic though, I can see how right and wrong change over time as well, but it’s the basic rights and wrongs as a adolescent that a lot of people in my city had to pick from. For those of you who don’t know Baltimore is often referred to as the heroin capital of the US. While I personally believe there are worse places than here, crime is still high. A lot of teens in this area have seen their family struggle, being on welfare and drugs, and no other life than a life of crime. They think that by robbing killing and dealing dope, they’re being “men”, and “surviving”. I was in the same situation as them, and knew I couldn’t go down that path. If I wanted to lift my family out of the city, I would go to school and make something of myself. And it’s exactly what I’m doing now.</p>
<p>So yes, even though rights and wrongs change over time, the basics will always be there.</p>

Morals aren’t real either imo, they are just an emotional reaction, that you learned as a kid through education and your parents.<br>
Do they change when you get older and think more for yourself, but everybody still has the base morals coming from when they were kids.<br>
Why do we cry for the death while other cultures party or just ignore it? What is right and wrong?<br>
I guess what you believe yourself is right.</p>

Well i have a simple question, you can be doing something “Evil” for alot of people but, probably they do not know the background so the question is… Does the ending justifies the means?<br>
Probably You’re to be killed, or you’re family is to, you have to act! but You’ll do bad stuff, its all about where you are standing right now.<br>
You don’t have other’s people shoes to step in and see what they’re doing, but there are things that are, well that i could consider bad, but it’d be like killing somone for no reason ya knw?</p>

We kill all the time during war. Does that make it right?</p>

              <p>Right or wrong. It’s all about thought really. If you like to see life as a wonderful and precious thing to have then taking a life would be considered evil. Though, if you genuinely think the world is against you and nothing is worth fight or living for then taking a life wouldn’t be such a big deal. Murder is only an example of this. There are many actions and beliefs that can twist the arrow.</p>
