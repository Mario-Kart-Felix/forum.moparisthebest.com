    <title>Takeshi&#39;s castle</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/takeshis-castle/298255</link>
    <description>There is this commercial on the Dutch Comedy central for Takeshi&#39;s castle. In the background they play a Japanese song, which for some odd reason sounds quite good. But I have no idea who sings it, or the title of the song. So are there any Dutch members that happen to know the name of the song/woman who sings it? Or even has a link to the commercial or to the song itself?

              <p>I am not Dutch but I have tried finding it for you to some extent. I’m not sure if this is what you’re after but here it is anyway.</p>

<p>Anyway, if it is what you’re after then it’s called Let’s Go! but I’m not sure who by. There are also some related music videos on the website if you need more help finding what you need.</p>
