    <title>Never does his homework</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/never-does-his-homework/256711</link>
    <description>I was thinking a while back. Lets say there is a guy who NEVER does his homework, or a terrorist will rape his captured mother, and he will explode. 

Anyways, one night, a teacher says &quot;your homework is to not do your homework&quot; what should the guy do?</description>

<p>If your homework is not to do your homework, then there is really no homework to do, and it is therefore not classified as homework, as it is not to be done. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
