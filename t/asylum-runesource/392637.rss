    <description>There was a freak accident in which a soda can in my bag (coke zero) exploded. The soda damaged my laptop (which was in the bag and running). As a result, my laptop is currently not functioning and as such, I cannot work on my server. The soda also did collateral damage to my homework and stuff. As a result I request that my previous topic in this section get locked until I can get the source back.


I have decided to start a quick project on an early version of runesource by blakeman8192 (Insert thread link here). I have done a little bit of stuff which is on the following list.
I think I am using a revision from around 30 or so because that was the last time I downloaded it. This is not azure, because I dislike the source for reasons which I will not state.


April 26- Not much done today.
Worked on the servers multithreaded processing abit. Completed the Fork Join framework implementation (gotta &lt;3 Netbeans).
Started redoing the Position system (I don&#39;t like the current one)

April 25-
Added Hyperions Update Flag system.
Did some work on the player system. Players now implement the runnable interface, and the current stage is identified by an enum. (Much like the use of login stages in Rune source). Credits to myself, and also lazaro for some inspiration.
Added Hyperions event manager, and also my tick system from vitality (I had released a tut on adding it on a different forum).
Started work on a basic region system.
Handled commands via a map (similar to shards or in this case legacy614 &lt;3 ya all).
Handled packets via an array. Similar in aspects to Hyperion.
Got rid of StreamBuffer (because it pisses me off).
Started work on player appearance settings.
Copied every packet from an old source, and documented each incoming value.
Action buttons are read like hyperion rather than the majority of other sources.

So far I almost have the setup like I want it, so hopefully nothing more will be credited towards hyperion. 

I have started a semi-conceptual integration of the fork join framework however, due to the new nature of this feature I will be sure to benchmark it. Otherwise I will just use a system of countdown latchs to submit the player to a threadpool, which is where implementing runnable is handy. Also because the stage is set via an enum, I can use a switch. This means that (if i recall) the method is cached in the jvm for awhile so future calls should be faster.

Edit:: In a nutshell

[code]
    @Override
    public void run() {
	switch (getUpdateStage()) {
	case PRE_UPDATE:
	    setUpdateStage(UpdateStage.UPDATE);
	    return;
	case UPDATE:
	    setUpdateStage(UpdateStage.POST_UPDATE);
	    return;
	case POST_UPDATE:
	    setUpdateStage(UpdateStage.PRE_UPDATE);
	    return;
	}
    }
[/code]

Taken from Entity.java
[code]
    private UpdateStage updateStage;

    /**
     * The current Updating stage of the entity.
     */
    private enum UpdateStage {
	PRE_UPDATE, UPDATE, POST_UPDATE
    }
    
    public void setUpdateStage(UpdateStage updateStage) {
	this.updateStage = updateStage;
    }
    
    public UpdateStage getUpdateStage() {
	return updateStage;
    }
[/code]

I will tidy this up tomorrow.

              <p>Checked out some handy books from the campus library mainly regarding server design and some basic design patterns.

<p>Tbh its ironic how many of these design patterns that I have been using for months and I just never knew the names.</p>
<p>Will be fairly busy until the weekend after this weekend with tests and stuff.<br>
Also its been confirmed that this will be released open source once the initial base is done.<br>
After that it will be developed by yours truly and then hosted as a server by innovationX.</p>
<p>After the core systems are done, I will probably work on the basics such as equiping, droping, banking, trade, dueling, a quest base, and finally adding all packets and all the frames that I can think of.</p>
<p>So essentially I will leave it to you guys to work on combat and content (such as skills and quests).</p>
<p>Converted all my content to grahams hyperion release. This includes dueling, trading, and also full combat / npc combat done (entity based).</p>
<p>For skills so far I have shitty to decent bases for all but Farming.<br>
Minigames include basic pest control (like in the old delta servers).</p>

<p>Obviously. Due to the recent nature of this project (it started yesterday afternoon), it is safe to say that my server is no where near complete with the threading system. Also I fail to see how you have seen anything that would make you assume that I have not multithreaded correctly.</p>
<p>Also, I have exams / finals the next 2 weeks or so, so I will not spend very much time on this.</p>

<p>No - he’s right. Multi-threading can only prove more efficient if done properly and used on a multi-core machine. By the looks of it you haven’t implemented multi-threading correctly unless you provide more code/evidence.</p>

<p>I have already made a toggle for the ability to multithread for certain tasks. When I get more content, I will perform benchmarks to see whether single or multithreaded is better in this specific server.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Also</span><br>
After talking to my friend (who is not developing, but was an inspiration for me starting this) I have decided that there will be at least one release of this in the foreseeable future unless the server performs less that 90% of what an unedited rune source can.</p>

              <p>There was a freak accident in which a soda can in my bag (coke zero) exploded. The soda damaged my laptop (which was in the bag and running). As a result, my laptop is currently not functioning and as such, I cannot work on my server. The soda also did collateral damage to my homework and stuff. As a result I request that my previous topic in this section get locked until I can get the source back.</p>
<p>I have decided to start a quick project on an early version of runesource by blakeman8192 (Insert thread link here). I have done a little bit of stuff which is on the following list.<br>
I think I am using a revision from around 30 or so because that was the last time I downloaded it. This is not azure, because I dislike the source for reasons which I will not state.</p>
<p>April 26- Not much done today.<br>
Worked on the servers multithreaded processing abit. Completed the Fork Join framework implementation (gotta &lt;3 Netbeans).<br>
Started redoing the Position system (I don’t like the current one)</p>
<p>April 25-<br>
Added Hyperions Update Flag system.<br>
Did some work on the player system. Players now implement the runnable interface, and the current stage is identified by an enum. (Much like the use of login stages in Rune source). Credits to myself, and also lazaro for some inspiration.<br>
Added Hyperions event manager, and also my tick system from vitality (I had released a tut on adding it on a different forum).<br>
Started work on a basic region system.<br>
Handled commands via a map (similar to shards or in this case legacy614 &lt;3 ya all).<br>
Handled packets via an array. Similar in aspects to Hyperion.<br>
Got rid of StreamBuffer (because it pisses me off).<br>
Started work on player appearance settings.<br>
Copied every packet from an old source, and documented each incoming value.<br>
Action buttons are read like hyperion rather than the majority of other sources.</p>
<p>So far I almost have the setup like I want it, so hopefully nothing more will be credited towards hyperion.</p>
<p>I have started a semi-conceptual integration of the fork join framework however, due to the new nature of this feature I will be sure to benchmark it. Otherwise I will just use a system of countdown latchs to submit the player to a threadpool, which is where implementing runnable is handy. Also because the stage is set via an enum, I can use a switch. This means that (if i recall) the method is cached in the jvm for awhile so future calls should be faster.</p>
<p>Edit:: In a nutshell</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    @Override
    public void run() {
	switch (getUpdateStage()) {
	case PRE_UPDATE:
	    setUpdateStage(UpdateStage.UPDATE);
	    return;
	case UPDATE:
	    setUpdateStage(UpdateStage.POST_UPDATE);
	    return;
	case POST_UPDATE:
	    setUpdateStage(UpdateStage.PRE_UPDATE);
	    return;
	}
    }</code></pre>
<p>Taken from Entity.java</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    private UpdateStage updateStage;

    /**
     * The current Updating stage of the entity.
     */
    private enum UpdateStage {
	PRE_UPDATE, UPDATE, POST_UPDATE
    }
    
    public void setUpdateStage(UpdateStage updateStage) {
	this.updateStage = updateStage;
    }
    
    public UpdateStage getUpdateStage() {
	return updateStage;
    }</code></pre>
<p>I will tidy this up tomorrow.</p>
