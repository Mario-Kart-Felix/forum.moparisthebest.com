    <title>Learning how to code rsps</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/learning-how-to-code-rsps/511445</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;d like to know a quick way to learn java [size=24pt]ONLY for rsps[/size]. By quick I mean something that cuts to the chase. I&#39;ve looked at other peoples work and it got me thinking how did could they just put words together like that and make such a great thing. So if someone could link me a something (preferably a video) that would help me learn this magnificent language it would be greatly appreciated. Will rep+ and thank.</description>

              <p>Watch some youtube videos, also, there are many tutorials on starting off on a rsps like this: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,342685.0.html</a><br>
Also i suggest you learn to code basic java first, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0</a> that is a good site.</p>
