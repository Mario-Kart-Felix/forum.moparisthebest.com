<p>The tree itself isn’t a mob, just the leaves that are doing it. I don’t how it would be coded if its a mob or not, or if the leaves would be coded to do that.</p>

<p>How about stone giants? Or maybe stone… walkers.<br>
Stone walkers are in caves, blending in with the stone. If you walk by them due to not noticing or simply walking by, nothing happens. Attempting to mine them will make them come off the wall and attack you. They have a 1.5 second delay of coming off the wall and are rather slow, so running or logging out could save your ass. They can be noticed, however, as every 5 seconds, their eyes will make a slight twinkle, just enough to let you know to not mine there. Killing them has a 100% chance of 1-64 stone, a 20% chance of 1-32 coal, 10% of 1-16 iron, 5% chance of 1-4 gold, 2% chance of 4-16 lapis, and a 1% chance of 1-2 diamonds.<br>

Cool idea[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks.<br>
Not to jack rs on this next idea, but some evil trees would be cool.<br>
However, rather then simply bashing you repeatedly, the leaves on them slowly grow lower and lower, until after 15-20 seconds, you’re surrounded by leaves and are slowly suffocating. Best way would be to cut through the leaves beforee your surrounded. No special drops, 1% chance of a tree doing this to you.</p>

Moles. Those little fuckers would pop up, take a random item from your inventory, then run away. Occasionally, they will just pop up, then go back down. Item is only stolen if you are on the block they come out of. It only takes one hit to kill them. If they have ur item, they won’t go underground until 50 blocks away. The item they take will be the one in your hand. If it is stacked, they will steal one of them. They spawn inside of random dirt / grass blocks. Hitting them drops mole skin, which can be used to make an armor inbetween the strength of leather and iron, better then gold.<br>

<p>Not to mention the annoying underground tunnels they would probably make.</p>

I think we could use a pet or 2 actually (not the mod though, i mean naturally), like use a porkchop on a dog to tame him, he can assist you in diging. The ‘tame’ period will last for 10 minutes, and you can give him a bone to raise this by 30-60 seconds.</p>
<p>Actually, this sounds like a decent idea for someone to make a mod for <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

Lmfao, that would suck if you forgot to feed em. Be building your house one minute, you turn around not thinking about it. SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS</p>
