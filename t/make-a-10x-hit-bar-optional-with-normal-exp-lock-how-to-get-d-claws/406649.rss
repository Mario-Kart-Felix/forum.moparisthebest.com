    <title>Make a 10x Hit Bar optional with normal ?/ EXP Lock/ How to get D Claws?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-a-10x-hit-bar-optional-with-normal-exp-lock-how-to-get-d-claws/406649</link>
    <description>It&#39;s client sided i know, &#39;public static boolean newDamage =&#39; But, i was wondering if there was a code/command where it could make it possible to turn it off without wrecking it for other players who want it there?

Also for EXP Lock, i have another source that has it. Would it be possible to steal the interface from that source to my new source ?

And last, how do i get dragon claws for my source? I know it goes in &#39;ItemDef.java&#39; but im not quite sure how to like add it to the game ? 

Thanks in advanced :D</description>
