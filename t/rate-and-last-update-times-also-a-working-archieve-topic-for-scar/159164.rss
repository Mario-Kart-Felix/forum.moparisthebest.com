    <title>Rate and last update times also a working archieve topic for scar</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rate-and-last-update-times-also-a-working-archieve-topic-for-scar/159164</link>
    <description>So I think searching up-to-date scar scripts that are usefull are hard to find. So I thought there should be atleast an update to the scar scripts topic that would say when it has been updated and maybe user rating (*-***** maybe?) or you could do some cool ass scripts to the forums but it would be easier this way :).</description>

              <p>The problem with something like this is, ratings will always stay, and the posts to verify the scripts that they’re up-to-date will always stay, rs will always update and scripts will always stop working for the current runescape at one point. Making an up-to-date script section requires a dedicated team to test scripts after each update, and there seems to be little scripting going on here.</p>
<p>I suggest you head over to <a href="http://www.srl-forums.com/forum/index.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">the SRL</a> forums, you’ll have better luck over there, since there are a lot more people making up-to-date scripts.</p>

              <p>Good to see your looking for ways to improve the forum, why don’t you start this off your self to impress the community, you can start a topic titled “Up-to-date scripts &amp; Ratings” or similar, and link to working scripts in a large post with ratings for each one next to the link. Other people can help you update it and voila your problem is solved.</p>
