    <description>hey ppl

i made a webclient 

and when i use it, it downloads cache and shows background, then i can log in and shows me chat area and inventory..

but the playing screen keeps black and says loading please wait ( could also be that it freezes)

how can this come ( happens to with my client now)

maybe its the map data ??? wrong in cache or such

              <p>A ‘T1’ error is also known as a ‘Invalid Packet’ error. I think the packet in which you are sending (General Player Position Protocol Packet) is malformed which is then causing the client to throw an error. Mainly because the fact I had the same problem when I was developing my framework.</p>
<p>Here is the error in more detail, hope this helps you.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">signlink.reporterror("Invalid Packet - Packet Id:" + packetId + ", Packet Size: " + packetSize + " - " + anInt842 + "," + anInt843);</code></pre>
<p>So your packet 123 was invalid.</p>
