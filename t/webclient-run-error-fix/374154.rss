    <title>Webclient Run Error Fix</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-run-error-fix/374154</link>
    <description>If you have followed Ric914&#39;s tutorial guide, but after uploading your cache, and putting the client.jar on your website/webhost, and you get and error that looks like this, or says, Error Connecting, then counts down numbers:
[img]http://i739.photobucket.com/albums/xx32/float1234/webclienterror.jpg[/img]

[size=36pt]STEPS TO FIXING[/size]
1) You will need to check and make sure when you changed your image directories in class30_sub2_sub1_sub1.java, that you changed them correctly. Ric wasn&#39;t very clear about some sprites, so I&#39;m going to explain. Some client&#39;s do not use Sprites, but use Spirts. So instead of searching for:
[code=javascript]./Spirts[/code]
If you still can&#39;t find the sprites/spirts, then try searching for:
[code=javascript]./Files/Spirts[/code]
Basically where you can find the folder that has pictures in it.(Pretty much common sense, people just mess up because of not correctly directing the image locations.
[size=24pt]IF YOU DO HAVE THE CORRECT SPIRTS LOCATIONS IT SHOULD WORK![/size]
2) The second common error for webclient run errors, is probably the most user-caused one. First of all, make sure you pack all your cache and spirt files correctly, by making a new .zip file. To do this, just right-click your screen, then click new .zip file. NOW, you will need to add your cache and spirts/sprites correctly. To do this, find your cache folder in your client. Once you have found it, open it up, and all of the files that are in there, need to be moved into the new .zip file. NOW, for the spirts/sprites, you will need to find the file containing them. This also causes the webclient error. Read below on how to FIX it.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________
3a) When you put the sprites/spirts into the new .zip file, you need to make sure you keep them in the same directory as stated in class30_sub2_sub1_sub1.java. For example. IF you changed the ./Sprites/, to C:/.yourclientname_file_store_32/Sprites/, you will need to make sure you actually add the entire Sprites Folder into the new .zip file, not just the files inside.
3b)If you had spirts, or the sprites/spirts where located inside of a certain file such as &quot;File&quot;, then simply add this to C:/.yourclientname_file_store_32/Sprites/:
[code=javascript]C:/.yourclientname_file_store_32/File/Sprites/[/code]
or for Spirts:
[code=javascript]C:/.yourclientname_file_store_32/File/Spirts/[/code]
ONCE AGAIN, this is all about directory PEOPLE. Its pretty much common sense, but I figured why not post, because I was bored, and this is the number 1 error. Ric never pointed out how to fix this, but I guess he intended also, that is was common sense. If you have questions/need help, feel free to send me a PM, I&#39;ll be glad to answer any questions.

[size=18pt]Also for those that are senior members, if you flame, your lame. Why? Well think back to the time that you were a newcomer to coding private servers. I bet you didn&#39;t even know how to compile your own LEECHED client. So now that you have read this, and you still post flame or comments that express carelessness/hatefulness, I roflmao @ you.
