    <title>Almost done, can almost play... Wait nope</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/almost-done-can-almost-play-wait-nope/43818</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been trying to play MoparScape for a while, and yesterday I came really close. I downloaded everything I needed and I got to the part where it downloads Mopar in the loader that looks like RuneScape (The 16mb download.) And just so you know I have dial up... So 16mb is about 3 hours worth of downloading. And after it dowloads it for a bit (like up to 5%) It closes it out. So that means I have to restart the entire download again. Can anyone tell me how to get this stupid thing working?! 

Ps~ I can&#39;t buy a different internet. [br][size=1]Posted on: January 04, 2007, 06:50:50 AM[/size][hr]And my comp doesn&#39;t disconnect, it literally just closes out without me touching anything. [br][size=1]Posted on: January 04, 2007, 06:52:15 AM[/size][hr]Got to go school, if you know how to help, please post and I will read later.</description>

              <p>1- Maybe your firewall is OK with everything in the mopar download,until it reahces 5%.Then it detects something it finds agaisnt it,and closes the download because it thinks it’s harmfull.Check your firewall,what it blocks,and what moparscape has in it.</p>
<p>2- Mayve your computer is too old.</p>
<p>3-You have a virus that prevents downloads,or a virus that messes up your computer.</p>
