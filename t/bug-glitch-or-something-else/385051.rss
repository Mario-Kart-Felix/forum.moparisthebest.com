    <title>Bug/Glitch or something else?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bug-glitch-or-something-else/385051</link>
    <description>Alright. First, let me make something clear. I will be stating the name of my server and the ip through this post. I do not intend it to be advertising or such. This is for an all problem resolving purpose.

okay, here&#39;s the problem. I have recently made my private server online. Took me a few weeks to code a bit and make it player-friendly. then I decided to make it non-hamachi. Took me about a day to do so. After i went through the -complicated (for me)- process of portforwarding, I have tried to post my server on [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?]http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php?[/url] because I figured it would be the best place to attract more people to my server than myself.

After I made a pretty nice post (which took me about half an hour), I clicked on &quot;register server&quot;.
It gave me an error: &quot;Your server must be online before posting it in here!&quot;.
So, I double.. No. Triple checked, and it was truly online. Here&#39;s what I also made sure of:
the input of server IP was really pluc-scape.no-ip.org without any misspelling or such.
Then since it still did not work, I tried it on ANOTHER no-ip; ipluc1.no-ip.org . Still didn&#39;t work.

After what just happened I thought to myself I could just not give up after all that work. So, I tried bypassing that part and entered instead of &#39;ip&#39; things like &quot;google.com&quot; and etc. because i truly was convinced it would work anyway.

So now I am left out with an online working server that moparscape recognizes as offline and nobody to help me get it advertised.

What I would just like to know is:
Why did it tell me it was offline when it was not? Is it some kind of bug/glitch more people are getting through as we speak?

Thanks for understanding the meaning of the post anyhow,

              <p>I would double check to make sure the port is opened.

As Vain stated, this section is for server programming, not things like opening ports, buying VPS’s, etc.</p>
<p>You can use a website such as <a href="http://www.canyouseeme.org">http://www.canyouseeme.org</a> to see if a port is opened.</p>

<p>I will report this topi for now, and we will see whether a moderator locks, or deletes this topic, as it’s their decision.</p>
<p>Anyway, I suggest posting in <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,363862.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this topic</a>. Though, you should read a couple pages first, as your question will most likely have been answered.[/quote]</p>
<p>No problem for reporting as long as the thread will have existed.</p>
<p>Here’s one thing - MoparIsTheBest was unfortunately really unclear about the problem I had. It (his thread) somewhat answered my question. It gave me no idea when I should be posting my server and how (since the 30 minute checks).</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will just end as an old thread that have been answered and nothing more-<br>
I don’t see why it should be deleted. 'Should take it as an example for the future experience of other posters//<br>
Should be moved.<br>
But thanks again, anyways.</p>

I did read the rules already.<br>
To the best of my knowledge, I didn’t break any.</p>
<p>P.S. Here’s a tip:<br>
Instead of telling me to read them again, point out my error. That’s what a GM should do.<br>
(I use gm because you seem to be posting “that’s against the rules” on some posts recently)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
If you took this post as offensive please change your thought; I didn’t want to sound rude or anything. So for that I apologies. I’m just trying to disclaim my post.<br>
[/quote]This section is for help on the sever’s programming errors. Such as errors in content, or other things along that line.</p>
<p>To my best knowledge, this type of thing would be best in the Server Status Page Comments thread, or at least General Questions.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not a moderator, nor will I ever be one, so I don’t have to post like one to tell you this is the wrong section. Sorry.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you. So could you guarantee I could repost this in that section without being banned or such for ‘double posting’?</p>
<p>Maybe shall I ask for this thread to be closed first…</p>
