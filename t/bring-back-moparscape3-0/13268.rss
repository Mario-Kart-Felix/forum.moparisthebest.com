    <title>Bring Back MoparScape3.0</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bring-back-moparscape3-0/13268</link>
    <description>Well I think that this &quot;Mopar&quot; character should leave MoparScape3.0 so it can still be used. You cannot even log into a private server on MoparScape3.1 as all it says is &quot;Your Account is already logged in. Try again now or make another name.&quot; So I try again, same message. Then I make another account, guess what? Same ****in name!!!

I am sure that there are other MoparScape users that have the same problem. I have not modified any files at all. 

On the console, it says that the file: shops.cfg cannot be found even though it is there.

Can somebody actually help or get MoparScape3.0 running again as that is user friendly and 3.1 is complete bullshit!</description>
