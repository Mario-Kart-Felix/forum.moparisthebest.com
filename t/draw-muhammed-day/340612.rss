    <title>Draw Muhammed Day!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/draw-muhammed-day/340612</link>
    <description>Sorry I was planning to post something like this earlier but I had exams.

The &#39;free&#39; press is paralyzed by fear. They fear for their lives and the lives of their employees, I don&#39;t blame them, I blame those who threaten them.
We cannot rely on the press to uphold our freedom of speech, a grassroots approach is needed.

Hence, on the [b]20th May 2010[/b] we will hold the first annual Draw Muhammad Day. Take a piece of paper, draw something and call it Muhammad, stick it in a public place with a message explaining why you did it.


Ever since the Danish cartoons incident, the media has been censoring itself in fear that if it were to somehow insult Islam, innocent people would be harmed. This kind of censorship is much more dangerous than government censorship, as it is much harder to fight, since there is no single entity responsible, but rather millions of individuals. The creator of &quot;Draw Muhammed Day&quot; is trying to combat the huge amount of self-censorship (mostly in the media) by getting many people to stand up to the threats of the extremists by stating that they refuse to live in fear of even sometimes well-backed-up threats anymore.

Very recently, the cartoon South Park showed Muhammad apparently dressed up as a bear, (which then turned out to be Santa Clause) and its producers received death threats. Even though this is mostly an American issue, I feel the need to stand by in solidarity.


Now before anyone erects the predictable canard &quot;this offends Muslims, don&#39;t do it&quot;. Consider this.
If you believe taxes should go up, but someone else believes they should go down, you would have a discussion about it and nobody would feel offended. After all its good for society if both sides put forward their cases and the best one is chosen.
Same for everything else, voting Labour or Conservative, Democrat or Republican, Windows or Linux.
We have laws to protect people but not ideas. Ideas survive or sink in the open discussion forum we call society. Discussion of an idea being offensive to some people is not grounds for that discussion to be censored.

<p>Yes you’re right that this is a big problem with the world. People mostly research subjects not to gain wisdom but to reconfirm their own beliefs.</p>

<p>And I agree with Niall. I thought it was about saying a big ‘fuck you!’ to people who play on the fact that some people are scared of being blown up, anthraxed, or stoned to death. I don’t really care if people deny the holocaust though, so they still lose in my opinion.</p>

<p>I thought draw muhammed day was more about free speech and saying a big “fuck you” to people who have things censored through death threats.</p>
