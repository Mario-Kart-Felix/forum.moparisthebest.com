    <description>Hey, ive been working on this for 2 days now and I CANNOT find how you make npcs hit harder!Ive checked Google, RuneLocus, and even silabsoft. cant find any tuts on how to do this. I just made a other help thread here for helping with items and they responded in like 30 seconds. I like this community way better then RuneLocus now :D. But yea, how do i make my bosses hit hard with mele/range/mage, i just want melee though. Thanks :D[br][br][size=1]Posted on: October 23, 2009, 08:13:11 pm[/size][hr]3 days :(, help plox</description>
