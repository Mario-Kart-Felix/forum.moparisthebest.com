    <title>Can anyone help me add Customs to my server, and Are they Client or Server sided</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-help-me-add-customs-to-my-server-and-are-they-client-or-server-sided/286332</link>
    <description>In my client, i have custom items (the ID&#39;s etc in Models), such as the Death Cape.. on one server i&#39;m trying, they work.. but on another, they don&#39;t. 

I thought the models were all kept in the client.. surely if they&#39;re in the client won&#39;t they work no matter what the server running is?

Do i need to some how embed those custom items into my server aswell as my client? 

Anyone help me.. anything 

Anyone had the same problem? :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 30, 2009, 02:51:41 pm[/size][hr]Ps:.. I dont need to know how to create them, i need to know why they arnt loading (being &quot;Null&quot; or saying &quot;NON EXISTING ITEM!&quot; when you wield.. when they work on one server, but not another.

            class8.anInt169 = -6;
            class8.anInt194 = 1;
            class8.anInt204 = 14;
            class8.anInt165 = 3287;
            class8.anInt200 = 3287;
            class8.anInt175 = -1;

            class8.anInt199 = -1;
            class8.aString170 = "Death Cape";
            class8.aByteArray178 = "The cape worn by masters of PKing.".getBytes();
        }</code></p>
<p>That is a death cape, and when picked up in BOTH sources, it IS a death cape, However, on one it goes onto the weapon slot… and on the other it works properly…</p>
<p>Any ideas?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 01, 2009, 04:23:52 am[/size][hr]OMG you fixed it!!!</p>
<p>Just one more problem, those all work now because i’ve set them in the item4.java thing… but there isnt a weapon one there it just says “hopefully the rest are weapons” and because of this they don’t work… is there any way to like create a weapon thing in there or add them to somewhere like Item4.java??</p>

              <p>Hmm adding items first in client is good but u forgot the server sided things: (i dont have a server right now but i THINK how to fix that)</p>
<p>The problem with non-existing weapon is go to:<br>
Item.cfg or Item.Class forgotten :S<br>
And add it there thats the file with all that bonuses of weapons/armour</p>
<p>Then i dont know this for sure</p>
<p>But go to Item4.class<br>
And put your Legs/head whatever in the right spot</p>
<p>And Save and compile</p>
<p>Hope it works…</p>
