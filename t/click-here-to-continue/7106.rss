    <title>Click here to continue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/click-here-to-continue/7106</link>
    <description>Okay, you know where it says &quot;click here to continue&quot; (e.g talking to an NPC or gaining a level)
Well it used to continue when i clicked it, now it just stays at &quot;please wait&quot;

I made some changes to stuff... I might have changed that by accident
The most recent change i did was getting rid of the d long spec... if that has anything to do with it...

Can anyone tell me what&#39;s wrong or how to fix it?

Help would be appreciated[br][size=1]Posted at: July 31, 2006, 01:26:40 AM[/size][hr]cmon... someone?</description>
