    <title>Remembrance day</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/remembrance-day/242435</link>
    <description>So remembrance day is coming up (Canada), and at school we always have our moment of silence during a remembrance day assembly, helps to remind twats.
Everything sounds good with that right? Well this year we have a few Americans who wouldn&#39;t pay their respect during the moment of silence, nor would they even put on the poppy because of the simple fact that they&#39;re American. They said because it wasn&#39;t their fault our soldiers died. What the fuck is wrong with people? They live in Canada, our soldiers died so they could live here freely. We even took in Americans in times of war, yet these ingrates wouldn&#39;t even wear the poppy for even the duration of the assembly.
I know you don&#39;t need to wear the poppy to pay respect, but think as a war vet. It must be nice to see everyone publicly acknowledging their sacrifice.

<p>I suppose we must agree to disagree. It’s been a rather interesting debate and you have put forward some very challenging points. I barely saw any contradictions in your arguments and i was rather impressed.</p>

<p>There were many people in Australia who chose to fight overseas to protect other’s freedom. No matter what orders were given, those soldiers still lost their lives and there efforts to protect freedom (which is something you stand for), should be respected simply for that.</p>

<p>my point of view is that because of the freedom these people gave me, i shouldn’t be forced to respect them if i choose not too.</p>
<p>For argument sake, i dont respect the people that died for our freedom. Because they where just following orders. Then again i dont respect very many people at all, i dont go around handing out my respect.<br>
The people that went above and beyond, the ones that are impressive by all counts, i respect to a degree. But i still stand by my point that i should not be forced to respect them.</p>

<p>Respect for these men is demanded because it is deserved. Even having the few minutes silence is considered respect. You don’t have to respect the individuals, just what they have done for us.</p>

<p>You’re not forced into celebrating freedom at all. Respecting the individuals that allowed it is completely different. To be honest, this little debate isn’t going to go very far considering neither of us will change our viewpoint no matter what facts are presented.</p>

<p>Any man that has died for another individual or group of people deserves our respect. However, their reasons behind it must be justified. If you come into a country, it’s expected that you adopt their customs (or at least respect) them for the time that you are there.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience where i was on visiting the National Australian War Memorial. There were a few South African children next to me who continued to complain about them having to visit it. They kept saying to the tour guide, “Why should we be here? It has nothing to do with us?”.</p>
<p>Sadly, ignorance spreads if the general population is not educated as to what should be considered correct.</p>

<p>The germans fighting against us, while they where the ‘bad’ side from our point of views, they fought for there country.</p>
<p>If your country went to war and you had to fight it wouldnt matter the reason. Fighting for your country is the same, good or bad.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah, its what i mean :). But i also just think whatever soldier, they should be respected and people really should respect enough to partake in remembrance day and other such events. Although of course such things cannot be forced and its still down to the person what they do.</p>
