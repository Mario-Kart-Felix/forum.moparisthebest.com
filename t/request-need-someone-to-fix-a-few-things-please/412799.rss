    <description>Hey guys this is my first post on here and i was hoping someone could help me pretty quick =/. I have no clue how to code and i bought a VPS for my server because the person who was coding for me said everything was done and i could release it. When i got on the server everything looked pretty good but i need a few things changed. Now the person who was coding for me is never on skype so i can&#39;t really ask him and my other friend who could help me is dealing with the hurricane Irene after effects. So if ANYONE could please change these 3 things on my server i&#39;d be greatful as hell.

Contact me on AIM or MSN

AIM- iiiiiiepiciiiiii
MSN- loganizbak@hotmail.com

The few things i want changed is the Home area with the shops, The xp rate, and Armadyl and Saradomin GWD both work 100% but there&#39;s no way to actually get IN the dungeon if someone can fix that. I also have a client problem but i don&#39;t think this is the section to ask about that.</description>

              <p>To change the home you need to change the teleport chords, Find the chords it’s teleporting you at the moment, and search the chords in the Search bar, Search the first 4 numbers which is the X chord Once you have found it change the chord to the place you want it to be… If it’s a new account go to Config.java (If PI), or player.java (Delta, Allstar etc), and find the chords for that… Then edit it to where you want…</p>
<p>For the Shops go to shops.cfg, there is shows all the shops it has at the moment… To add shops you press enter and you type in this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>SHOPID = Id of the Shop E.G 3 would be the Shop id. The ID is needed so the NPC it’s selling is using the correct shop… if you get what i mean</p>
<p>SHOP NAME HERE = The name of the Shop. If you are adding Spaces then use _ insted of a space…</p>
<p>2	2 = Sell and Buy, If you want the shop to sell and buy only what it has keep it as 2	2, If you want it to buy anything and sell anything have it as 1	1</p>
<p>ID    AMOUNT = The ID and the Amount the shop is selling. the ID is the ID of the Item, E.G 5698     10. This means it’s selling 10 Dragon Daggers(p++)…</p>
<p>The client section i can’t help cuse im hopeless at client editing lol</p>
