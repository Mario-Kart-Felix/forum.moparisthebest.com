        <p>It’s this time of year again where Call of Duty fans go crazy for the reveal of the next CoD! This new CoD (as far as I have seen) looks to be set in the future perhaps? The “ember” teaser that I’ve just seen (also down below) kind of gives me the idea that this year, CoD fans are going to be given a game set in the future, once again. Treyarch have updated Black Ops 2 and have added some kind of easter egg into some, if not all, maps of the game. The easter egg links to their snapchat account “callofduty” which every once in a while snaps a cool and short clip from the game to what we believe is going to be called: Black Ops 3</p>

        <p>I never cared for the campaigns in the call of dutys. Especially in Black Ops 2. I rage quit that shit 1 mission in because there was too many cutscenes and shit.<br>
It was like<br>
<em>Walk 10 feet</em> cutscene<br>

<p>I like to play games, not watch movies in games.</p>
<p>And I probably won’t be getting this game, either. They’ve been shitting out “Future war” games for a while now, each decreasing in how good it is. Plus, I’m still pretty pissed off at Activision (The company that owns the Call of Duty name) by how they handle their ban system. My account was hacked via my email (I lost the email linked to my xbl account a while back, and then the genius decided to take my xbox account). After recovering the two, I was perm banned on Black Ops 2… the real kicker? Activision will <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> look into permanent bans. As soon as it’s put in place on your account, that is the end of it.</p>
<p>However… I’m wanting to see what they will do with the zombies game mode… That may be the only reason I purchase the game, if I decide to.</p>

        <p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:9, topic:551250”]I never cared for the campaigns in the call of dutys. Especially in Black Ops 2. I rage quit that shit 1 mission in because there was too many cutscenes and shit.<br>

Ouch, that sucks. And yeah, Advanced Warfare got pretty boring and they’re making us pay to buy zombies.</p>

        <p>I think black ops 1 zombies was way better than black ops 2 zombies.  The maps in bo1 were alot more fun esp. moon and I like how they brought back the waw zombie maps aswell that was great.  Bo2 I didnt like the weapons as much. Didnt like the maps as much either. bus depot tranzit was pretty cool but I wish they wouldve expanded on it and maybe made it  so that you could go to other maps as they were realesed or something.  I also just didnt like the way the zombies moved in black ops 2 plus the fire on town was terrible. Orgins I think was by far the worst map.  I like the new perks they brought in bo2 tho so thats a plus.  and the lag oh the lag bo2 had terrible lag.</p>

<p>I honestly didn’t like that they made you <span class="bbcode-i">buy</span> the maps from the previous game. You already own the maps from the old game (Most did anyways), and some even own the old game still (I know I do).<br>
You clearly did not play Tranzit well enough mate… They literally had the FIRST zombies map built into tranzit…<br>
The fire was rather annoying, but there were many ways to avoid it. I think what really annoyed me is that they didn’t include PHD Flopper onto a lot of the maps. That shit is needed for high round survival.<br>
Though one of my favorite maps on Black Ops 2 would have to be Buried or Mob of the Dead. Running through the witch house on buried is fun, and so many people don’t know how to avoid them. Plus the map is rather big so there’s plenty of room for people to set up and run trains. Oh, and don’t forget the traps, traps fudgein everywhere.<br>
Mob of the Dead is really fun once you’ve completed a couple of tasks to get the golden spork.</p>

Honestly I don’t like the futuristic semi-mech combat games they’re coming out with now… BO2 was pushing it but it was enjoyable, don’t like AW because of all the gadgets and jetpacks and what not. I know they’re going for different because it’s always the same thing but, I like the pure run-n-gun multiplayer, where it’s all up to reaction time, and knowing each weapons strengths to bring you to victory. Too much going on in these new ones.<br>

Call of Duty: Advanced Warefare was a prom night dumpster baby between Halo 4 and Call of Duty (imo, based on how “futuristic” they tried to make it). Don’t bring it into this conversation, it needs to go away.[/quote]<br>
I regret spending ANY cash on that game, I can’t believe I bought it from Xbox Marketplace… I would have taken that shit back.</p>

I think black ops 1 zombies was way better than black ops 2 zombies.  The maps in bo1 were alot more fun esp. moon and I like how they brought back the waw zombie maps aswell that was great.  Bo2 I didnt like the weapons as much. Didnt like the maps as much either. bus depot tranzit was pretty cool but I wish they wouldve expanded on it and maybe made it  so that you could go to other maps as they were realesed or something.  I also just didnt like the way the zombies moved in black ops 2 plus the fire on town was terrible. Orgins I think was by far the worst map.  I like the new perks they brought in bo2 tho so thats a plus.  and the lag oh the lag bo2 had terrible lag.<br>

I honestly didn’t like that they made you <span class="bbcode-i">buy</span> the maps from the previous game. You already own the maps from the old game (Most did anyways), and some even own the old game still (I know I do).<br>
You clearly did not play Tranzit well enough mate… They literally had the FIRST zombies map built into tranzit…<br>
The fire was rather annoying, but there were many ways to avoid it. I think what really annoyed me is that they didn’t include PHD Flopper onto a lot of the maps. That shit is needed for high round survival.<br>
Though one of my favorite maps on Black Ops 2 would have to be Buried or Mob of the Dead. Running through the witch house on buried is fun, and so many people don’t know how to avoid them. Plus the map is rather big so there’s plenty of room for people to set up and run trains. Oh, and don’t forget the traps, traps fudgein everywhere.<br>
Mob of the Dead is really fun once you’ve completed a couple of tasks to get the golden spork.[/quote]</p>
<p>I know that they had the first maps im talking about like when the map packs came out if you could get to buried from tranzit or to nuketown from tranzit etc and i couldnt agree with you more about buried</p>

Pretty sure he was saying he regretted buying the game itself… Since he bought it on the marketplace, he cannot sell/return it</p>
