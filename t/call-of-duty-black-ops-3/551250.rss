    <title>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/call-of-duty-black-ops-3/551250</link>
    <description>It&#39;s this time of year again where Call of Duty fans go crazy for the reveal of the next CoD! This new CoD (as far as I have seen) looks to be set in the future perhaps? The &quot;ember&quot; teaser that I&#39;ve just seen (also down below) kind of gives me the idea that this year, CoD fans are going to be given a game set in the future, once again. Treyarch have updated Black Ops 2 and have added some kind of easter egg into some, if not all, maps of the game. The easter egg links to their snapchat account &quot;callofduty&quot; which every once in a while snaps a cool and short clip from the game to what we believe is going to be called: Black Ops 3

              <p>I havenn’t played COD much in the past few years so things are definitly a lot more challenging than I was expecting.</p>
<p>Pick 10 includes everything. I don’t remember it including mods and optics before.</p>
<p>You have to use the gun to unlock the mods for it</p>
<p>The personalizing is incredible with so many different options available.</p>
<p>Same old challenges for the most part get x kills, get x wins.</p>
<p>The only down side so far is the crappy server performance and camping / suppressors.</p>

<p>Add me on PSN: Jmood123 and we can play. :)[/quote]Hows it compare to BLOPS 2? Black Ops 2 has been my favorite COD since Cod4/Mw2 (but more Cod4)…</p>
<p>Anyone can answer</p>
<p>[quote=“Chassy13, post:10, topic:551250”]Haven’t bought a copy of CoD since MW3, which I really disliked. The first BO was actually pretty enjoyable, and I never really played the second one. I would consider any Treyarch productions but flat out will never buy another IW game again.[/quote]I would agree with what everyone else is saying about Black Ops 2. It’s my favorite game more-recent CoD. The multiplayer is fantastic, the level up system is unique, and I love how you aren’t forced to have a pistol, instead you can trade it for another perk. I know that’s not a good summary of the game, but it’s very much worth buying.</p>

<p>Why would you even consider buying stuff on advanced warfare? I sold it just right after my first two games…[/quote]<br>
Pretty sure he was saying he regretted buying the game itself… Since he bought it on the marketplace, he cannot sell/return it</p>

<p>I think black ops 1 zombies was way better than black ops 2 zombies.  The maps in bo1 were alot more fun esp. moon and I like how they brought back the waw zombie maps aswell that was great.  Bo2 I didnt like the weapons as much. Didnt like the maps as much either. bus depot tranzit was pretty cool but I wish they wouldve expanded on it and maybe made it  so that you could go to other maps as they were realesed or something.  I also just didnt like the way the zombies moved in black ops 2 plus the fire on town was terrible. Orgins I think was by far the worst map.  I like the new perks they brought in bo2 tho so thats a plus.  and the lag oh the lag bo2 had terrible lag.</p>

<p>I honestly didn’t like that they made you <span class="bbcode-i">buy</span> the maps from the previous game. You already own the maps from the old game (Most did anyways), and some even own the old game still (I know I do).<br>
You clearly did not play Tranzit well enough mate… They literally had the FIRST zombies map built into tranzit…<br>
The fire was rather annoying, but there were many ways to avoid it. I think what really annoyed me is that they didn’t include PHD Flopper onto a lot of the maps. That shit is needed for high round survival.<br>
Though one of my favorite maps on Black Ops 2 would have to be Buried or Mob of the Dead. Running through the witch house on buried is fun, and so many people don’t know how to avoid them. Plus the map is rather big so there’s plenty of room for people to set up and run trains. Oh, and don’t forget the traps, traps fudgein everywhere.<br>
Mob of the Dead is really fun once you’ve completed a couple of tasks to get the golden spork.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I agree… I didn’t see a point in purchasing the maps all over again, that doesn’t make sense to me.</p>

<p>I know that they had the first maps im talking about like when the map packs came out if you could get to buried from tranzit or to nuketown from tranzit etc and i couldnt agree with you more about buried</p>

<p>I think black ops 1 zombies was way better than black ops 2 zombies.  The maps in bo1 were alot more fun esp. moon and I like how they brought back the waw zombie maps aswell that was great.  Bo2 I didnt like the weapons as much. Didnt like the maps as much either. bus depot tranzit was pretty cool but I wish they wouldve expanded on it and maybe made it  so that you could go to other maps as they were realesed or something.  I also just didnt like the way the zombies moved in black ops 2 plus the fire on town was terrible. Orgins I think was by far the worst map.  I like the new perks they brought in bo2 tho so thats a plus.  and the lag oh the lag bo2 had terrible lag.</p>

<p>I honestly didn’t like that they made you <span class="bbcode-i">buy</span> the maps from the previous game. You already own the maps from the old game (Most did anyways), and some even own the old game still (I know I do).<br>
You clearly did not play Tranzit well enough mate… They literally had the FIRST zombies map built into tranzit…<br>
The fire was rather annoying, but there were many ways to avoid it. I think what really annoyed me is that they didn’t include PHD Flopper onto a lot of the maps. That shit is needed for high round survival.<br>
Though one of my favorite maps on Black Ops 2 would have to be Buried or Mob of the Dead. Running through the witch house on buried is fun, and so many people don’t know how to avoid them. Plus the map is rather big so there’s plenty of room for people to set up and run trains. Oh, and don’t forget the traps, traps fudgein everywhere.<br>
Mob of the Dead is really fun once you’ve completed a couple of tasks to get the golden spork.</p>

My account was hacked via my email (I lost the email linked to my xbl account a while back, and then the genius decided to take my xbox account). After recovering the two, I was perm banned on Black Ops 2… the real kicker? Activision will <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> look into permanent bans. As soon as it’s put in place on your account, that is the end of it.</p>
<p>However… I’m wanting to see what they will do with the zombies game mode… That may be the only reason I purchase the game, if I decide to.[/quote]<br>
Ouch, that sucks. And yeah, Advanced Warfare got pretty boring and they’re making us pay to buy zombies.</p>

              <p>It’s this time of year again where Call of Duty fans go crazy for the reveal of the next CoD! This new CoD (as far as I have seen) looks to be set in the future perhaps? The “ember” teaser that I’ve just seen (also down below) kind of gives me the idea that this year, CoD fans are going to be given a game set in the future, once again. Treyarch have updated Black Ops 2 and have added some kind of easter egg into some, if not all, maps of the game. The easter egg links to their snapchat account “callofduty” which every once in a while snaps a cool and short clip from the game to what we believe is going to be called: Black Ops 3</p>
