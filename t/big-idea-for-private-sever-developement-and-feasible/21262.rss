Make the client do its fair share of the computing.
All the client does these days is connect to the server, record mouse &amp; key events, and display the game.
That really isn&#39;t much considering the server and the client both run on the standard household computers of the people running &amp; and playing the game.

     Yes, thats really it. Just make a sever with the most basic things possible:

A playerhandler,
A socket,
(Perhaps) A system timer synchronised with the client.
A table full of booleans player stats &amp; other things,
System for updating files when logged out,

Thats it.
     Now, I know. It makes another problem: Client editing. However; note that all the game upgrading will be upgrading the client, which means the client will have to be re-downloaded every time the most up to date version of the game needs to be played. In essence, it is all client editing. And note; if someone had already created an edited client for the current way servers are set up, they would already be able to control it. Since nobody has devoted any time to it, making one wouldn&#39;t be any easier, and only a total jackass would bother to hack a private server, I don&#39;t think its really a big problem.

Just think about it ;)

              <p>There is one major flaw with your idea, this is how rsc used to work a long time ago when autorune reigned supreme and you could dupe items, except even it wasn’t as bad.</p>
<p>If you transfer the player stats to the client, that means the client tells the server when their stats go up and stuff, so it is a simple client edit and you can tell the server that you have 9999bil and 99 in all the stats.  Is that what you really want? stat editors and the like?</p>
<p>Good idea, but it would simply be horrible in practice.</p>
<p>If you want to reduce the load on the server, how about writing a decent server instead of the crap one everyone is using now.  98% of your load is because of the horrible coding and structure.</p>
