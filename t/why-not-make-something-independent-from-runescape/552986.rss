    <title>Why not make something independent from Runescape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-not-make-something-independent-from-runescape/552986</link>
    <description>You know, Moparscape&#39;s been here for a long time right? You&#39;know what I mean? But like, how come no-one after all of these years has yet made an independent game that is based on Runescape? Listen guys, for the amount of years Moparscape made their forums and means to allow the player to make a failed or a successive server, amongst this, we have players who can model game content that does not exist in the game; or use substances that are from the game itself. How come Moparscape isn&#39;t pushing for that... big statement?

Why can&#39;t Moparscape, with the association of the best of the best of Private Server designers, Coders, Model Makers, SFX/GFX designers come hand to hand together to make something that is based on the private server content, but, let&#39;s go beyond this! What if the best designers of Moparscape create new Player and NPC models? Like literally... replace everything in the game. So that it doesn&#39;t look like Runescape. I know this may sound difficult, but if everyone pitches in, I&#39;m sure, they can recreate an entire world. And to lead them are the Modelers of Moparscape.

So now my question if it wasn&#39;t clear :

How come nobody is going for the Call-To-Action yet? Using the most modern Server Client, you can restart with that and just, start from scratch. :P

What do you guys think huh? :D --

Also, don&#39;t worried about Jagex. As long as you replace the models, replace the music, and sound effects you&#39;ll be fine. Some models should be kept however because you can&#39;t honestly do everything right? Another thing, you won&#39;t get sued by Jagex if you happened to have used their coding and re-modified it to your preferences.. you&#39;ll be fine. Sometimes you need to stop a monopoly.</description>
