    <title>Ad Nauseam - To the Point of Sickness</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ad-nauseam-to-the-point-of-sickness/532459</link>
    <description>[center][IMG]http://i838.photobucket.com/albums/zz305/stuartperera/logo_zpsf2087006.png[/img][/center]

Ad Nauseam is a continuation of Vicious Revolution under a new name. Ad Nauseam will be an economy/pk server where our skilling will be as near complete to 100% as possible. We will have XP rates set to be competitive so you will not be able to get a 99 in 1 hour. It will take at least several hours for an easy skill.

Here is a little history on where Vicious Revolution was before. To begin with, we bought Virtue, the server this one is based off in January of 2013. The reason behind us purchasing Virtue was because of the content packed into it. At the time, it was one of the few servers with near complete Summoning. This was one of the big reasons why. Another reason is it had tons of content including an awesome unique dungeoneering skill.

As we progressed in development, we decided to pick up a few more developers. With our large team, we were able to develop many things to add to the never ending list of content. We then released to the public, which is where we made our first mistake. That mistake was releasing it as a full server instead of a public beta. We were in Alpha for a long time, but we did not play as in depth as we could of and did not pick up a lot of the bugs. 

The whole entire time Vicious Revolution was released, it was basically an unofficial beta. We fixed so many bugs including dupes, its not even crazy. Eventually, my partner and VR&#39;s financial support lost interest and hasn&#39;t been on in awhile. I decided that with the amount of money and time invested into this server, its too good to archive and not do anything with.

This is where Ad Nauseam comes into play. With a whole new team, and the continuation of VR under a new name. Without a doubt, we will make it further as a server and community than VR made it simply because of the comparison of planning.

A few examples of our planning include: 

[ul][li]Alpha - (Nearing Completion)[/li]
[li]A Private Beta[/li]
[li]A Public Beta[/li]
[li]Having investors[/li][/ul]


Right off the bat, we will not mass advertise. I know this is usually the way of going about it if you want a decent player base right away. However, we are not confident the server is completely bug proof. We feel this decision will be better for the long run and will have a positive impact on the community once we build a decent and stable player base.

Now that I&#39;m done with the description of what brought this server to be, I can list you guys with content, future ideas, and provide you with some media.

To those of you that might possibly be interested in playing in the closed beta, let me know. I may let 5-6 people in. :P

Thanks for reading it if you made it through all this reading. To all of those &quot;tldr&quot; newbs, there are still pictures. :P</description>

I would say good luck but as you guys bought for the most part the content…<br>
[/quote]A lot is bought yes, doesn’t mean it isn’t a good server. In fact, I think its one of the more content packed ones out there.<br>
[/quote]You are advertisinga “development” that has already purchased content. That isn’t a development.</p>
<p>What a development would be would be new content that is being written as of now from your new, by your new team.</p>
<p>From what I gather though you are showing images of the former source.<br>
[/quote]why does that matter though? content is content + code is code.<br>
[/quote]Because purchased code isn’t development as there is no progress with that.[/quote]That actually is progress.</p>
<p>Example: Prior to me not having grand exchange, I paid someone to do it and add it, now I have grand exchange. PROGRESS!!!</p>
<p>Anyways, I am not paying anyone anymore for any code as 1 i don’t have any money, and two that was my old parter luka on vicious revolution who was paying people.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>More details on the emote tab: Uses all HD sprites, includes unlockable emotes (have not added any content to unlock them yet, but will as development progresses), includes two special emotes being “Give Thanks” emote and “Seal of Approval” emote. All work with timers so you can’t overlap the emotes. You can’t do emotes in wilderness or while attacking npcs or other players. You can’t do emotes while trading.</p>
<p>Give Thanks is an emote 12 seconds long (LOL), so it has a 12 second timer.</p>
<p>Seal of Approval is an emote 7 seconds long so has a 7 second timer. It also includes a random seal of 6 different ones every time you do the emote.</p>
<p>Pretty easy stuff, but very time consuming! :hurr:</p>
