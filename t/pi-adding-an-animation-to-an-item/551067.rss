<p>If you would like to apply an animation to the player… the you can just use the startAnimation method. However, the effects won’t show when walking (Walking animation overrides others).</p>
<p>You could also change the player’s stance/walk/run/etc indexes to be that of the animation you want, which would make it so regardless of what the player is doing, it’ll show that animation (But moving would look really funky…). You’d have to reset these to default when they stopped using the item.[/quote]</p>
<p>The only thing I could think of is maybe the texture animation of the fire cape.</p>
