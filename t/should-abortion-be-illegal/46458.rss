mopar you didn’t get what yakman and I were saying. WOMEN WILL DO IT ANYWAY. The law will only deter 1% of them.</p>
<p>When you say, [quote]Killing an innocent human being should never be a choice, ever.[/quote] you are saying that it shouldn’t be a ‘choice’. Then don’t make abortion illegal, have campaigns AGAINST it. So that the <span class="bbcode-i">women</span> will make the choice not to have an abortion, not the government.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>People will murder anyway, so make murder legal and then have campaigns against it. Yea, that argument works real well. :rolleyes:</p>

<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>The woman or girl, whatever the case may be, had a choice, they chose to have sex and therefore must suffer whatever consequences there may be.  Even after they get pregnant they still have a choice.  It is called adoption.  Killing an innocent human being should never be a choice, ever.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>she doesnt have a choise if shes so drunk she’d have sex with anyone, and when you’re drunk you really dont think about a condom or anything, just animal instinct,<br>
iv heard a lot of storys of people, boys and girls, regreting their one-night-stand. its always the same old, ‘she looked great last night, this morning she’s an ugly bitch’<br>
also, some girls might pull the ‘abandon-baby-in-box-outside-charity-shop’, its faster and theres no administation, remember, these girls are scared, vunerable and feeling alone, their boyfriend has problably left them,</p>
<p>im not by-definition pro-abortion, i just belive its necessary, manure stinks but its total necessary to spread it on fields to make crops grow better</p>

<p>So if I get drunk and then kill someone I should not be held responsible for my actions?  Then why is a DUI a crime?</p>

You missed yakman’s point. The person may be able to <span class="bbcode-i">choose</span> to die, but not without experiencing extreme pain (physical or mental) before hand.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. Before surgery you get knocked out, so you don’t even know what is happening. With abortion, a (young!) fetus is not conscious (brain not developed), therefore cannot “feel” the death in the first place. If you wait for it to choose for its life to end, it WILL “feel” the pain that it could have avoided in the first place.</p>
<p>And notice I said <span class="bbcode-i">young</span> fetus. A more mature fetus should not be aborted, but a young fetus does not have much of a brain yet, thus I think the current laws are fine.[/quote]</p>
<p>So at what age do you draw the line then? Is there a certain moment that it is too old to abort? It is ending a life either way you look at it.</p>

if abortion was made illigal, the numbers of aborted children would stay more or less the same, such a law would only force these people do go to unlicened backstreet abortion clinics<br>

<p>Wrong. Not only does it not make sense, but it is completely unsupported by any evidence, laws against abortion would of course deter most people from having them.</p>
<p>Think about this, since Roe v. Wade, 47,282,923 people have been killed, think about that, any one of those could have found the cure to cancer or aids, they could have fixed global warming or pollution, or created world peace, but our country  did not have the balls to stand in the way of them being killed.</p>

<p>point proven right there, i think abortion should be illegal but if those 47 million kids were born that would only help suport global warming, over populating causes the environment  to be destroyed. sure like you said someone could give birth to someone who has the vure for cancer and all that, but if it wasn’t for death more people would die, diseases like cancer destroy the weak and let the strong live. global warming is going to be are downfall for us human its a trap, only a few people will surive and start another society, but what happens after that oce age when the sun is coming to an end there will be no way to stop that. sun controls life  and once that gone we die. so does it matter in the end if abortion is illegal or legal in the end every person follows a diferent road to the same thing in the end, death. with that being said it shouldnt matter and that illegal drugs become legal to get rid of the stupid people. so should murder, murder works as a keeping a society not to over populate. honestly if the government didnt want murder they would take away all threats  for death.</p>

<p>About the rape issue, I simply stated that it has never been against the law to abort in cases of rape or incest, I still do not agree with it at all, and still believe it is murder.</p>
<p>On the issue of the mother possibly dying during childbirth, that will always be a tough decision, and should obviously be the decision of the mother.</p>
<p>Yakman, you seem to think that there must 1 law with no exceptions, when in fact this is never the case.  Even in the case of murder, while it is illegal, there are exceptions to the rule such as self defense for example.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sdouble">@sdouble</a>, I know that adoption is not the best thing that can happen to a child, but your girlfriend does agree that it is better to be adopted than to have never lived at all, right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Most of the time, yes.  But because of the adoption, she’s incredibly depressed.  Some little thing may happen (ie: she got a speeding ticket) and she’ll get upset.  Then she’ll think about how she could have prevented it by simply driving the speed limit.  Then she’ll remember that when she was in high school and still living with her adoptive partents, she received enough speeding tickets to get her license suspended.  Then she’ll remember how upset her parents were.  Then she’ll think about other ways she has upset them.  Following that, she’ll think about how her brother and sister (offspring of the adoptive parents) don’t do things like that.  Then she’ll feel she does things like that because her birth mother is a piece of trash that abandoned her because she wanted to party and have sex with every man willing.  Then she’ll think about how much she hates her.  Three hours of crying later, she’ll actually talk to me about it and it’s always the same thing.  She hates her birth mother and herself.  Two hours after that, she’ll realize she overreacted and everything is back to normal except she’s still pissed.  And anything will set her off.  Like dropping a piece of silverware on the floor and the noise scares her (I have hardwood floors).  As I said, adoption is great, but it’s the only solution. Too bad it isn’t as easy on the child as everyone would expect.  She hates to think about how her life would have been if her mother decided to just keep her instead.</p>
<p>I’ll never feel any other way about abortion.  I think it’s wrong, I think whoever has one is a murdered, reagardless of when they get the abortion.  As mopar said, once an egg is fertilized, a life has begun.  I am with him on that.  And ending that life, whether someone feels it is a human yet or not, is murder.  But the mother may not give the child up for adoption so it could lead a semi-normal life.  Why make the child suffer for 18 years?  This would be a form of torture.  Think about how you would feel growing up with a mother that doesn’t care about you at all.  One that actualy tells you that if the government allowed it, you would have been aborted.  Knowing your mother wanted to kill you before you even had a chance to live.  Your own mother wanted to end your life.  Some of these women would change over time and accept the child.  Some will not and the child will always be a hinderance to them.  I would rather receive a bullet to the head than go through that for 18 years.</p>

<p>Technically, different groups don’t regard the foetus as “living” until a certain stage has been reached. Generally, I think people would consider a foetus to be “living” after the first trimester. Of course, as I said that view is up to each person.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn’t see something as living if it didn’t respond in any way (for example, babies start kicking in the womb eventually - responses wouldn’t have to be that significant, but if it did nothing at all, then it wouldn’t be functioning, thus not living). So abortion before a certain level of development has occurred is fine with me. As mentioned by Yakman, abortion as means for contraception is wrong no matter which stage of development the foetus is currently at.</p>
<p>Oh, and someone tell me how to spell foetus if I’ve spelt it wrong. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=6" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"><br>

<p>The instant the semen enters the egg cells start dividing, reproduction is one of the key signs of life, not to mention that cells are accepted by all to be living, therefore the fetus is alive from the very beginning.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sdouble">@sdouble</a>, I know that adoption is not the best thing that can happen to a child, but your girlfriend does agree that it is better to be adopted than to have never lived at all, right?[/quote]<br>
The group of cells are definately considered living, but they aren’t considered a human by many until they reach a certain stage - of course, this statement isn’t true for everyone; many like yourself would instantly say it’s a living human, which is fair and needs to be respected.</p>
<p>However, some would say that once fingers and other limbs are visible, it’s human. Others say once it can respond it’s human. Others might just say after the first or second trimester.<br>
Basically, it’s up to each different person.</p>

<p>Yes, it should be illegal… except in [proven] cases of rape or alien implantation.</p>
