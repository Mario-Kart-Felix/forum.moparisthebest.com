        <p>I feel it should be legal.  I am dead set against it, but I am not set against the freedom to make the decision.  Yes, I feel it is a person.  Yes, it is a living being.  Yes, I think it’s murder.  Yes, I know the child can be put up for adoption after it is born.  The reason I’m saying it should not be illegal is because the “mothers” carrying the child do not care about it.  That’s why they would be willing to murder it.  If it was made illegal, some women giving birth to the child would decide to keep it to get a friendly government paycheck.  They might smoke, drink, or do other drugs during the pregnancy which would damage the fetus.  If it doesn’t die during the pregnancy, it could be born with birth defects.  Including physical abnormalities, mental disorders, and addiction.  Is it fair to the child to have to go their whole life disfigured simply because his “mother” didn’t want him yet she was forced to give birth to him and continued feeding her drug addiction?  No, not really.  If I had a choice between being repulsive or having 1 finger on each hand or having a screwed up looking face to the point where I couldn’t live a “normal” life and people couldn’t stop staring at me OR simply never being born, I would vote for the never being born.  Life can be difficult at times.  It can also be great.  But is life really worth enough to go through it like that?  Even though that life would be normal to you, is it really worth it?</p>
<p>On a side note, my girlfriend was adopted by a wonderful family.  Her mother didn’t want her either.  Her mother did the things I have stated above, she was born with an extra finger on each hand, they were removed soon after she was born.  They didn’t have any bone in them so it was a simple cut and stitch procedure.  She’s lived with the small scars her whole life and has told me that sometimes she looks at other people’s hands and somehow finds it weird that other people don’t have them, because it’s so normal to her.  She knows her birth mother and has talked to her.  Knowing how her mother was, and is, she is incredibly happy to have been put up for adoption and adopted by such a loving family but she is still mad at her mother.  She’s on medication that treats her for depression and sees a councilor monthly.  Her mother “doesn’t know” who the father is.  My girlfriends hates her for this.  She has read a book titled “Adoption Healing” written by an author that was also adopted as a baby and found they share the same feelings and resentment.  Don’t get me wrong, adoption is great, it gives a child a chance to lead a life that they wouldn’t normally be able to lead.  But it’s still not a normal life.</p>

Technically, different groups don’t regard the foetus as “living” until a certain stage has been reached. Generally, I think people would consider a foetus to be “living” after the first trimester. Of course, as I said that view is up to each person.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn’t see something as living if it didn’t respond in any way (for example, babies start kicking in the womb eventually - responses wouldn’t have to be that significant, but if it did nothing at all, then it wouldn’t be functioning, thus not living). So abortion before a certain level of development has occurred is fine with me. As mentioned by Yakman, abortion as means for contraception is wrong no matter which stage of development the foetus is currently at.</p>
<p>Oh, and someone tell me how to spell foetus if I’ve spelt it wrong. :$[/quote]</p>
<p>The instant the semen enters the egg cells start dividing, reproduction is one of the key signs of life, not to mention that cells are accepted by all to be living, therefore the fetus is alive from the very beginning.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/sdouble.html">@sdouble</a>, I know that adoption is not the best thing that can happen to a child, but your girlfriend does agree that it is better to be adopted than to have never lived at all, right?</p>

        <blockquote>So if I get drunk and then kill someone I should not be held responsible for my actions?  Then why is a DUI a crime?</blockquote>
if someone gets drunk and kills someone, its considered manslaughter, not murder
<p>there are more reasons that one for having laws,<br>
the murder law is made to deter people from killing each other, it works, im sure there would be a lot more murders if it was legalised</p>
<p>but the adoption law cant and doesnt deter anyone from aborting, it only stops licenced clinics performing the abortion in a clean and mediacally profesonal way,<br>
if abortion was made illigal, the numbers of aborted children would stay more or less the same, such a law would only force these people do go to unlicened backstreet abortion clinics</p>
<p>(another reason for having a law would be control, a racist government could pass a law to make schools seperated by race, this doesnt deter anything except it means the victim group of people would recieve a lower standard as more money would probably go into the government schools, theres other reason for laws, i could go on)</p>
<p>an anti abortion law would be impossible to enforce, as anti-drugs laws have proven, even if you close down every illigal abortion clinic (unlikely IMO), there will probably still be someone who tries to induce a miscarrage by kicking the girl in the stomach loads of times</p>

The group of cells are definately considered living, but they aren’t considered a human by many until they reach a certain stage - of course, this statement isn’t true for everyone; many like yourself would instantly say it’s a living human, which is fair and needs to be respected.</p>
<p>However, some would say that once fingers and other limbs are visible, it’s human. Others say once it can respond it’s human. Others might just say after the first or second trimester.<br>
Basically, it’s up to each different person.</p>

        <p>mopar i agree with you, 100 percent, once that action has happend life has already begun now there are people that say life doesnt really start until your born…now i respext those ppls opinions enough NOT to flame them for it, but really life begins ONCE the sperm and egg meets…that begins life, it doesnt matter wheter or not it is “human” yet…it is still a life…</p>

<blockquote>
<p>if abortion was made illigal, the numbers of aborted children would stay more or less the same, such a law would only force these people do go to unlicened backstreet abortion clinics</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Wrong. Not only does it not make sense, but it is completely unsupported by any evidence, laws against abortion would of course deter most people from having them.</p>
<p>Think about this, since Roe v. Wade, 47,282,923 people have been killed, think about that, any one of those could have found the cure to cancer or aids, they could have fixed global warming or pollution, or created world peace, but our country  did not have the balls to stand in the way of them being killed.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/sdouble.html">@sdouble</a>, I know that adoption is not the best thing that can happen to a child, but your girlfriend does agree that it is better to be adopted than to have never lived at all, right?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Most of the time, yes.  But because of the adoption, she’s incredibly depressed.  Some little thing may happen (ie: she got a speeding ticket) and she’ll get upset.  Then she’ll think about how she could have prevented it by simply driving the speed limit.  Then she’ll remember that when she was in high school and still living with her adoptive partents, she received enough speeding tickets to get her license suspended.  Then she’ll remember how upset her parents were.  Then she’ll think about other ways she has upset them.  Following that, she’ll think about how her brother and sister (offspring of the adoptive parents) don’t do things like that.  Then she’ll feel she does things like that because her birth mother is a piece of trash that abandoned her because she wanted to party and have sex with every man willing.  Then she’ll think about how much she hates her.  Three hours of crying later, she’ll actually talk to me about it and it’s always the same thing.  She hates her birth mother and herself.  Two hours after that, she’ll realize she overreacted and everything is back to normal except she’s still pissed.  And anything will set her off.  Like dropping a piece of silverware on the floor and the noise scares her (I have hardwood floors).  As I said, adoption is great, but it’s the only solution. Too bad it isn’t as easy on the child as everyone would expect.  She hates to think about how her life would have been if her mother decided to just keep her instead.</p>
<p>I’ll never feel any other way about abortion.  I think it’s wrong, I think whoever has one is a murdered, reagardless of when they get the abortion.  As mopar said, once an egg is fertilized, a life has begun.  I am with him on that.  And ending that life, whether someone feels it is a human yet or not, is murder.  But the mother may not give the child up for adoption so it could lead a semi-normal life.  Why make the child suffer for 18 years?  This would be a form of torture.  Think about how you would feel growing up with a mother that doesn’t care about you at all.  One that actualy tells you that if the government allowed it, you would have been aborted.  Knowing your mother wanted to kill you before you even had a chance to live.  Your own mother wanted to end your life.  Some of these women would change over time and accept the child.  Some will not and the child will always be a hinderance to them.  I would rather receive a bullet to the head than go through that for 18 years.</p>

<p>About the rape issue, I simply stated that it has never been against the law to abort in cases of rape or incest, I still do not agree with it at all, and still believe it is murder.</p>
<p>On the issue of the mother possibly dying during childbirth, that will always be a tough decision, and should obviously be the decision of the mother.</p>
<p>Yakman, you seem to think that there must 1 law with no exceptions, when in fact this is never the case.  Even in the case of murder, while it is illegal, there are exceptions to the rule such as self defense for example.</p>
<p>sdouble, Thanks for the insight.  In my opinion, no matter what happens to the child, life is always better than death.</p>

Good point.</p>
<p>But, lets say the baby grew/ended up in a situation that is worse than death. It was not their choice to live in a life of torture. You cannot say no life is worse than death until you experience it yourself.</p>

if abortion was made illigal, the numbers of aborted children would stay more or less the same, such a law would only force these people do go to unlicened backstreet abortion clinics<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Wrong. Not only does it not make sense, but it is completely unsupported by any evidence, laws against abortion would of course deter most people from having them.</p>
<p>Think about this, since Roe v. Wade, 47,282,923 people have been killed, think about that, any one of those could have found the cure to cancer or aids, they could have fixed global warming or pollution, or created world peace, but our country  did not have the balls to stand in the way of them being killed.</p>
<p>Read some statistics:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/abortionstats.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/abortionstats.html</a><br>
<a href="http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/abortionstats2.html%5B/quote%5D" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.nrlc.org/abortion/facts/abortionstats2.html[/quote]</a></p>
<p>point proven right there, i think abortion should be illegal but if those 47 million kids were born that would only help suport global warming, over populating causes the environment  to be destroyed. sure like you said someone could give birth to someone who has the vure for cancer and all that, but if it wasn’t for death more people would die, diseases like cancer destroy the weak and let the strong live. global warming is going to be are downfall for us human its a trap, only a few people will surive and start another society, but what happens after that oce age when the sun is coming to an end there will be no way to stop that. sun controls life  and once that gone we die. so does it matter in the end if abortion is illegal or legal in the end every person follows a diferent road to the same thing in the end, death. with that being said it shouldnt matter and that illegal drugs become legal to get rid of the stupid people. so should murder, murder works as a keeping a society not to over populate. honestly if the government didnt want murder they would take away all threats  for death.</p>

<p>what about euthanasia, where someone has a terminal illness, they will die eventually but in the meantime they experiance a lot of pain, they would want the doctor to take them off the life-support machine. do you agree with ending a life of someone who will die anyway?</p>
