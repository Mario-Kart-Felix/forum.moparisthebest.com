    <title>Rsps 317 server question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-317-server-question/406397</link>
    <description>Alright so i&#39;m not completely new to coding a 317 server but i am new to all those 525+ servers. I don&#39;t want to code using those other server but i want to stick with the good old 317. Is it possible to take graphics from a 525+ server and upgrade my 317 server, and how do i get 634 item&#39;s into a 317 server. Please if there is a post answering my question please link it, I&#39;ve been searching all around for an answer and finally got tired of looking. Thanks (if it&#39;s not possible just say so) :)</description>
