<p>Had a nice convo with some guy named RodgerWilco:</p>
<p>[10:33:20 PM] *** Rodgerwilco has changed the conversation topic to “Karamja &lt;-- The only server to pay its players.” ***<br>
[10:37:23 PM] Mr Trouble: pays its players once the players pay karamja, right?<br>
[10:38:53 PM] Rodgerwilco: actually everyone who plays the free server can possibly get paid, you’re not forced to pay for the KaramjaRSC server.<br>
[10:40:30 PM] Rodgerwilco: I don’t recall any other server paying its players… hmm?<br>
[10:40:42 PM] Rodgerwilco: if you know of any previous server who has paid out let me know<br>
[10:42:39 PM] Mr Trouble: i dont know of any<br>
[10:42:53 PM] Mr Trouble: but i know of MANY that have much higher player count<br>
[10:43:01 PM] Mr Trouble: sry brah<br>
[10:43:22 PM] Rodgerwilco: Player count doesn’t matter<br>
[10:43:26 PM] Mr Trouble: plus wasnt the free server karamjapk<br>
[10:43:33 PM] Mr Trouble: the server that actually said fuck karamja<br>
[10:43:37 PM] Mr Trouble: and went to <a href="http://pkwith.me/" rel="nofollow noopener">pkwith.me</a><br>
[10:43:39 PM] Rodgerwilco: it’s not what I am trying to achieve<br>
[10:43:58 PM] Rodgerwilco: KaramjaPK is still moving forward, drugs and stuff got in the way lol<br>
[10:44:03 PM] Mr Trouble: actually, im positive that was the original plan<br>
[10:44:09 PM] Mr Trouble: hixk was making karmajapk<br>
[10:44:12 PM] Mr Trouble: u were making the paid server<br>
[10:44:16 PM] Mr Trouble: hixk went to <a href="http://pkwith.me/" rel="nofollow noopener">pkwith.me</a><br>
[10:44:20 PM] Mr Trouble: and so yeah<br>
[10:44:24 PM] Mr Trouble: you have karamja<br>
[10:44:26 PM] Mr Trouble: gg<br>
[10:44:31 PM] Rodgerwilco: The same original plan is still the same original plan, but yea. Drugs and stuff got in the way, doesn’t mean I can’t produce the PK server<br>
[10:44:38 PM] Rodgerwilco: which I have been working on and is ready to rumble<br>
[10:44:39 PM] Mr Trouble: o<br>
[10:44:42 PM] Rodgerwilco: so gg to you?<br>
[10:44:47 PM] Mr Trouble: so youre making 2 servers now<br>
[10:44:47 PM] Rodgerwilco: lol<br>
[10:44:48 PM] Mr Trouble: gotcha<br>
[10:44:53 PM] Rodgerwilco: yes<br>
[10:44:56 PM] Mr Trouble: lold<br>
[10:44:59 PM] Mr Trouble: gl<br>
[10:44:59 PM] Rodgerwilco: I actually had to trim down content<br>
[10:45:02 PM] Rodgerwilco: on the pk server<br>
[10:45:35 PM] Rodgerwilco: but player count is not my goal, im sure there will be a good community and active. But I have my eyes on a bigger picture.<br>
[10:45:39 PM] Mr Trouble: tbh, might as well take the people in this chat, and have them pick a random number<br>
[10:45:53 PM] Mr Trouble: cause thats the eprson that will win ur $$$ on whatever server u release<br>
[10:46:10 PM] Rodgerwilco: no<br>
[10:46:23 PM] Mr Trouble: im trollin hard<br>
[10:46:23 PM] Rodgerwilco: it’ll take some talent <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I want the best pker to win xD<br>
[10:46:23 PM] Mr Trouble: atm<br>
[10:46:39 PM] Mr Trouble: just fuckin with you<br>
[10:46:56 PM] Rodgerwilco: I don’t think you’re trolling. I think you sound confused and disoriented and now… trying to cover it up with the word troll.<br>
[10:47:08 PM] Mr Trouble: not at all<br>
[10:47:14 PM] Rodgerwilco: Don’t toss the word troll into a conversation when you get your ass spanked. I was about to insert the ownage.<br>
[10:47:15 PM] Mr Trouble: i know ur all about “unique content”<br>
[10:47:26 PM] Rodgerwilco: Thats not the bigger picture either <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
[10:47:38 PM] Mr Trouble: k well keep telling yourself whatever makes you sleep at night<br>
[10:47:46 PM] Rodgerwilco: I’m trolling you brah, relax<br>
[10:47:54 PM] Rodgerwilco: but serious though. That’s not the bigger picture lol<br>
[10:48:27 PM] Mr Trouble: k, well in all seriousness, normal people go with tangible results… so whatever youre saying… doesnt mean a whole lot<br>
[10:48:33 PM] Mr Trouble: unless you back it up with results<br>
[10:48:38 PM] Mr Trouble: not trolling atm<br>
[10:49:31 PM] Mr Trouble: release the BEST WEB BROWSER EVER!!! if nobodyh uses it, doesnt mean fuck all<br>
[10:49:47 PM] Mr Trouble: but that would also require the a really good coder…<br>
[10:49:57 PM] Mr Trouble: OH SHI-<br>
[10:50:58 PM] Mr Trouble: i see u typin bro<br>
[10:51:05 PM] Mr Trouble: gettin ready for the paragraphsssssssss<br>
[10:51:25 PM] Rodgerwilco: The big picture is the filtering of skiddies with lost childhoods, who were constantly abused and found rsc as their outlet. Only to grow up and unable to leave the game due to their insecurities. So they stay around and troll the community and anyone who has anything positive to put into it.</p>
<p>The big picture and overall goal of Karamja is to remove the waste and build a foundation on which the rsc community can rely on. What does it have? Mopar? RSCR? RSCE? It’s all complete shit. Time to set the standard for the future and it appears other server have already taken some of my unique content and implemented it. It just goes to show how much of an impact this server is having when it’s not even released. LOL So yea, pay your money for another fuckhead to go buy a bike and crash it.</p>
<p>I’m setting the bar pretty high <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
[10:52:24 PM] Mr Trouble: lol what<br>
[10:52:41 PM] Mr Trouble: ‘your money’<br>
[10:52:43 PM] Rodgerwilco: RSC is not ‘for profit’, and it should of never of gotten to that point. It’s pathetic.<br>
[10:53:01 PM] Mr Trouble: well, RSC actually WAS TOTALLY for profit<br>
[10:53:04 PM] Rodgerwilco: I was stating that sentence as if someone in this chat is going to copy and paste that<br>
[10:53:08 PM] Mr Trouble: gg.<br>
[10:53:40 PM] Rodgerwilco: RS2 made the money<br>
[10:53:44 PM] Mr Trouble: rofllllll<br>
[10:53:45 PM] Rodgerwilco: RS3 even more<br>
[10:53:55 PM] Mr Trouble: more doesnt mean it wasnt completely for profit<br>
[10:53:59 PM] Mr Trouble: you’re being stupid now<br>
[10:54:00 PM] Mr Trouble: cmon<br>
[10:54:13 PM] Rodgerwilco: It was not for profit lol. How much did they make in the first 3 years?<br>
[10:54:20 PM] Mr Trouble: IT WAS FOR PROFIT<br>

[10:56:55 PM] Mr Trouble: means i didnt CREATE PROFIT<br>
[10:56:58 PM] Mr Trouble: youre so fucking stupid<br>
[10:57:01 PM] Mr Trouble: its unbeleiveable<br>
[10:57:04 PM] Rodgerwilco: the point that rsc became profitable was the point when rs2 was in beta<br>
[10:57:16 PM] Rodgerwilco: My IQ is 144. You’re fucking retard.<br>
[10:57:17 PM] Rodgerwilco: 11<br>

<p>So, do you guys believe RSC was made for profit?  And should RSC private servers be made for profit because of the original path RSC took?  (This is about development of RSC private servers and the direction they should take in the future)</p>

        <p>Well I don’t mind rodger I think he provides excellent content to rsc. That aside. I think if he had 144 IQ he would have known when to stop replying to obvious bait. Ignore and move on. Aside from that if it doesn’t make profit in some way shape or form then it doesn’t make sense. For example if you are making a server to learn Java and have something on your resume even if the server is free I consider it a profit because that’s the end goal.</p>
<p>As for making RSC specifically around a business model. I think it’s an excellent idea. As long your not stealing money from players go for it.</p>

        <p>Oh dear, this is going to be embarrassing for your Bernard <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/confusedae52.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>Lol’d we can get on teamspeak, vent or whatever and debate this if you want?</p>
<p>Sorry but I played Runescape shortly after release, from Jan 4th 2001 -&gt; Feb 27th 2002 the game was free. Andrew developed and maintained the game and the servers in his bedroom of his parents house. “Despite humble beginnings” quoted by The Guardian in an article about Jagex will give you a slight hint, maybe you should do your research. During the early mmorpg days of the internet, a lot of games had a hard time turning a profit, so why in the world would anyone make an mmorpg for profit? Unlike you, I have actually talked to Andrew and have a glimpse of what sort of dedication it took.</p>
<p>[10:53:01 PM] Bernard: well, RSC actually WAS TOTALLY for profit</p>
<p>Good job Bernard, no. In no way shape or form was he sitting there thinking about money. The members fee came into play when he realized how much debt he was in and the money he owed for launching the game. The advertisement money wasn’t enough during the dot com bubble and needed a way to sustain itself. Once he realized the amount of popularity the game was achieving and when the money was flowing he decided to take the cash and invest towards RS2. By the time RS2 Beta came out, Jagex had 29 employees. The initial goal was to develop a great game. So back to your comment, was RSC for profit? No. Like I stated in your little post, RS2 and RS3 are.</p>
<blockquote>Profit : A financial benefit that is realized when the amount of revenue gained from a business activity exceeds the expenses, costs and taxes needed to sustain the activity. Any profit that is gained goes to the business's owners, who may or may not decide to spend it on the business. </blockquote>
<p>Not until 2003 do we see any real profit being made and in that year, there was an excess of 2m euros, 33% to Andrew</p>
<p>Not to mention Andrew was so against maximizing profits that he was booted out of his own company and if RSC for pure profit, they would of kept it around and milked it.</p>
<p>Then I’ll hear something along the line of, they were making money that’s profit. Sure short term profit as a tool to fuel a vision but that does not ensure profit over a long term. He was doing what he wanted to do without telling himself “I am going to benefit from these profits, gonna retire rich from rsc woohoo”. No. If RS2 would of been a bust he would of lost it all.</p>
<p>Bust just like your private server investment. LOL, lets talk about that financial decision you made.</p>

        <p>[quote=“<a href="http://pkwith.me/" rel="nofollow noopener">PKWith.Me</a>, post:1, topic:547869”]ead this to see how jagex actually started, They was funded by ADVERTS, Who cares if it was for profit or not for profit, They had 1 MILLION!! accounts registered in the first fudgeing year then 5000 subs in the first week in feb</p>
<p>No way he was in debt at all due to the fact if you ever went to the first RuneFest or listened online at RuneFest you will find out that they funded RSC by creating small little games for other companys, Till they thought “Why the fudge don’t we make our own game?!” And runescape was created.</p>
<p>5000 subs in the first week of subs at 3.20 when they first came out that is 16k that is worth 23.1k todays money (Yes that is right)</p>
<p>And that made them the largest! Pay to Pay game out at its time.<br>
RS2 Beta was 1st of dec 2003 and off beta on the 29th of march 2004</p>
<p>RSC bots got big everyone was botting so many worlds. Imagine if they had 12k active subs each month from feb 2002 till 1st of decemeber at 3.20 per sub what is 883.2k (1.2million)</p>
<p>It is most likely a lot more they made I would estimate anywhere between 2-5million, There is no way at all They could of funded all the sprites, models and etc if Runescape classic never made profit for the first 3 years!!</p>
<p>No bank would give them money if there company wasn’t profitable in 3 years.[/quote]Yes, but, why would you infect your players?</p>

        <p>Rofl Rodger, awesome lengthy response amounting to almost nothing.</p>
<p>The Guardian article DOES say “despite humble beginnings” (meaning he didn’t have a lot of money at the start) which translates into absolutely nothing as far as whether it was FOR profit or not…  Nice try at misleading with a quote.</p>
<p>The Guardian article mentions nothing about giant debt incurred by Andrew and him launching members due to that.  Did you just pull that out of your ass?  Oh wait, you TALKED TO ANDREW PERSONALLY (I’m sure you two were great friends, right?) that must be where all your REALLY VALID information comes from.</p>
<p>Its so clear that RSC was <strong>FOR</strong> profit that there is no reason to bother speaking anymore about this.  You spouting off your awesome online IQ test results were reason enough to post this log.</p>
<p>Mom was proud though, right?</p>
<p>Also, what RSC private server investment did I make again? CirnoPK? The one I put no money into and thus made 100% PURE PROFIT on? Yeah, actually sounds like a pretty great ‘investment’ (if you want to call something that I put no money into an investment, go for it)… Edit: If you want to talk about time spent as my investment, well, go for it, but this was done in my ‘free time’… So, good luck with that.</p>
<p>But here is a tip, you’d actually need PLAYERS to be able to do that. (Hey look, another thing RodgerWilco fails at achieving)  So, yes, glad we had that conversation about my awesome ‘investment’.</p>
<p>God damn man, you’re pretty dumb.  Can’t be fudgeed responding anymore.  Go ahead and take some more time to type some more paragraphs, although you’re wasting your time, because you’ve completely failed up to this point.</p>
<p>Edit: Cya Rodger.</p>

</aside>
<p>Seeing as you got your definition off of Wikipedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit</a>), I’ll go ahead and get the actual definition you should be looking at off of Wikipedia as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_corporation" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For-profit_corporation</a></p>
<p>Your issue here is you’re misunderstanding “for-profit” as meaning “for” profit. You’re taking it to literally mean that RSC made money (which it did) whereas what your nerd friend is trying to argue about is that they maintained RSC with the intent TO make profit. Whether or not a profit is turned is irrelevant in this sense.</p>
<p>Now if you’re trying to say that RSC should not be “for-profit” as well, which we can see from your website that your name shows up on where you claim you’ll “pay the players” to play RSC, people should understand that just because a company isn’t “for-profit” does <span class="bbcode-u">not</span> mean that company does not make money. Non-profit companies still have to cover their production costs as well as paying their employees. So you could label a server as non-profit and still be taking money from it to line your own pockets.</p>
<p>Though personally I view your “pay me a little bit now and you all can get your money back later” to fall precariously close to a Ponzi scheme more than anything else. If you actually care about RSC and being above the corruption seen so often in private servers when money is involved (Pyru comes to mind), then I suggest you, instead, spend the time you waste arguing on the internet about RSC doing actual work and saving up your own money. Come up with a plan for how much money it will cost to host for x number of months, and budget how much money you need to set aside from each paycheck to maintain that. Treat it like a hobby you want to put money into, and then open up a completely free server with your little monetary “giveaways” in order to lure in players.</p>
<p>Otherwise you’re no different from anyone else, apart from trying to hide behind a pseudo-altruistic guise.</p>

        <p>[quote=“<a href="http://pkwith.me/" rel="nofollow noopener">PKWith.Me</a>, post:1, topic:547869”]ead this to see how jagex actually started, They was funded by ADVERTS, Who cares if it was for profit or not for profit, They had 1 MILLION!! accounts registered in the first fudgeing year then 5000 subs in the first week in feb</p>
<p>No way he was in debt at all due to the fact if you ever went to the first RuneFest or listened online at RuneFest you will find out that they funded RSC by creating small little games for other companys, Till they thought “Why the fudge don’t we make our own game?!” And runescape was created.</p>
<p>5000 subs in the first week of subs at 3.20 when they first came out that is 16k that is worth 23.1k todays money (Yes that is right)</p>
<p>And that made them the largest! Pay to Pay game out at its time.<br>
RS2 Beta was 1st of dec 2003 and off beta on the 29th of march 2004</p>
<p>RSC bots got big everyone was botting so many worlds. Imagine if they had 12k active subs each month from feb 2002 till 1st of decemeber at 3.20 per sub what is 883.2k (1.2million)</p>
<p>It is most likely a lot more they made I would estimate anywhere between 2-5million, There is no way at all They could of funded all the sprites, models and etc if Runescape classic never made profit for the first 3 years!!</p>
<p>No bank would give them money if there company wasn’t profitable in 3 years.[/quote]</p>
<p>I like this answer.</p>

        <p>I am not even going to discuss anything with Mark because all the figures provided in his post are off except the little 5k in the first week. Not to mention the fact that a bank never gave them the money. " Imagine if they had 12k active subs each month from feb 2002 till 1st of decemeber at 3.20 per sub what is 883.2" No we are not imagining. The matter of the fact is that they made 2Mill euros before operating costs in that year. Maybe get your facts straight, stop imagining.</p>
<blockquote>The Guardian article DOES say "despite humble beginnings" (meaning he didn't have a lot of money at the start) which translates into absolutely nothing as far as whether it was FOR profit or not..  Nice try at misleading with a quote.</blockquote>
<blockquote>During the early mmorpg days of the internet, a lot of games had a hard time turning a profit, so why in the world would anyone make an mmorpg for profit?</blockquote>
Maybe you should try countering my statements rather than ignoring them. Which you even ignored in the skype chat. So this argument is irrelevant due to your inability.
<p>Your naive. Lets take a few statements you provided.</p>
<blockquote>"Its so clear that RSC was **FOR** profit that there is no reason to bother speaking anymore about this.  You spouting off your awesome online IQ test results were reason enough to post this log.</blockquote>
<blockquote>[10:53:01 PM] Bernard: well, RSC actually WAS TOTALLY for profit</blockquote>
<p>Totally : completely; absolutely.</p>
<p>So from 2001 to 2002, and it wasn’t till mid 2002 that they were making anything. That means they were TOTALLY for profit? No. I understand your logic, where you are coming from and yet your ignorance blinds you. I am such a nice guy that I am trying to explain to a retard word definitions and maybe a little history lesson.</p>
<p>Then I mention how Andrew was booted out of his own company which you couldn’t even talk about. The fact is that you don’t know and you’re unable to even comprehend these things.</p>
<p>I guess another figure that we can debate about is Howard Hughes, was he for profit? I would love to discuss this guy if you’re interested.</p>
