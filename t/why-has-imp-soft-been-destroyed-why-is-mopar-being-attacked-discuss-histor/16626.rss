    <description>Why Imp-Soft has been destroyed?

Well a few days lukeidiot joined the forums.  He talked about how he had arga.  Everyone called him a scammer.
He said did a scam, so i found proof and posted it.

Raw&#39;s myspace:

CACHED:

Then after that Ollie found these off of my links.


These were found by Ollie:

Now i was never asked to have these taken down.  Josh aka RaW aka HitMan found out about the pics being public and started to ddos.  Basically its about 500mbit/sec .  I have lost my ips for the server.  The ips are nulled and the DNS entries are now void.

              <p>i doubt he will attack sythe bc sythe “respects” him.  RaW will not attack those that respect him.</p>
<p>However RaW has now propably realized he should not have joined irc and talked also he should have never tried to get kib to shutdown all his clients(e-fak, mopar, reint, syi).  It was not until raw talked in irc did we all know who was behind it.  I was getting ddosed and still am for days before he went after mopar.  Even after he went after mopat i didn;t know.  It was after i talked to him directly in irc did i know.  Then i heard of the conversations he had 2 sayd before with kib.  It is imporant to note how much raw knows about everyone.  He is not stupid, he talkes to the people who have power and tries to get power.  This is how he has always been successful bc past leaders went with it.  This time the leaders being kib and mopar are not going with it.</p>

              <p>A botnet is a collection of comprimised hosts, generally they act like a worm - they scan IP ranges and find vulnerable IPs/hosts, exploit them &amp; infect them with the botnet software. The newly infected host then joins a IRC server where commands are issued, it thens joins a channel and reads a topic, if there is a command in the topic then the bot will execute the command automatically. Heh, a quick lesson.</p>

<p>Mopar has it under control. Just don’t worry about it. Seriously. Do whatever <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> want, but believe me when I say that it’s a waste of your time. Because if your smart enough to quickly steal somebodies botnet, you might as well do something else with your time and brains.</p>

<p>I agree with Aftermath, that stealing his botnet network isn’t the way to go. THe illegality of it all isn’t important, but it’s just easier to let RaW get bored. And who knows if your guesses are even right? Even if you are right, you might just escalate the whole nonexistent conflict even more. It’s just RaW  being an ass. A good defence is the best retaliation.</p>
<p>Besides, my niggers are already on the way.</p>

<p>[quote]Exactly, dont hassle the lady, she probably has nothing to do with RaW</p>

</aside>
<p>I can see the makings of a great film here.</p>
<p>Three armed niggers burst into an old lady’s apartnment. One of them has a .38 revolver, the other two have compact glock 20Cs, fully automatic pistols capable of letting off 20 rounds in a few seconds. The door has splintered and it’s laying on the ground. The old lady is sitting in an old rockingchair sipping tea.</p>
<p>“Where the fuck is RaW, bitch?” One of the niggers grabs her hair and pulls her off the chair onto her knees.</p>
<p>“Where, the fuck, is Raw?” He yells again, straight into her ear. She stammers out something which turns into a wail as the tall nigger, the one with the .38, drops a tiny peice of metal into the metal tube, and uses burning gas to propel it into the old ladies knee.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you want” she screams. She starts to go into shock, and the niggers drop her and start pumping her body with bullets. People all through the old apartment complex start screaming, and one of the niggers pulls a sawed off Benelli out of his boxers.</p>
<p>“Shits about to get hairy. But we’re going to find this motherfucker if we kill everyone who matches these fucking IPs.”</p>
