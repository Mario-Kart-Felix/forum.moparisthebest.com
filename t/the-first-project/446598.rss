    <description>[center][size=18pt]There&#39;s a first for everything, and this is only the start.[/size][/center]

[center][img]http://i1093.photobucket.com/albums/i427/Cowswithwings/Banner.png[/img][/center]

I would show a lot of pictures, but I would like to start completely from new and make this an original server without being a leeching noob.

[b]A little bit about me to start with, this will affect your decision to apply or not:[/b] I&#39;m 16, A few years back, I had my own server, It wasn&#39;t a great success and I [u]obviously[/u] was just a leecher with changing a few things.
I&#39;m back now and I really want to make a success of a server, No leeching, nothing like that, just originality and making it a great success. I&#39;ve only been learning programming a few days now, so I only know the basics, if that, but I&#39;m more than willing to put the time and effort into learning and doing everything I can to make this a great success. 
I realized that if I did all of this on myself, It would take forever and it would just be a daunting project, because i&#39;d have to be learning everything as well do the programming all by myself - This is why I thought..I&#39;m sure their is other people out there like me, or even just generally kind people that are willing to help me. Enough about me anyway.

[center][size=14pt]I would like this server to have[/size][/center]


[ul][li]All of the updated items. (614 - I think.)[/li]
[li]Be a 602 BUT with the old school characters and graphics like a (317) Their&#39;s no beating them.[/li]
[li]I would like a GE(Grand Exchange)[/li]
[li]A web-client and also a downloadable client.[/li]
[li]Many more but for the moment my mind has gone blank....[/li][/ul]


I think out of everything I would like to do, 4 or 5 Coders would be a decent amount for this type of project.

[center]Coders:[/center]

[center]Exzilled - Coder 1[/center]
[center]Coder 2[/center]
[center]Coder 3[/center]
[center]Coder 4[/center]
[center]Coder 5[/center]

And Ofcourse, where would we be without Suggestors? 2-3 Of them would be a decent amount.
If they could all talk together and come up with some great idea&#39;s. 

[center]Suggestors:[/center]

[center]Suggestor 1[/center]
[center]Suggestor 2[/center]

We would all need testers. They save us a lot of time and are a great help. - Will be provided with some type of reward when server is finished and running.

[center]Testers:[/center]

[center]Tester 1[/center]
[center]Tester 2[/center]
[center]Tester 3[/center]
[center]Tester 4[/center]

Donator&#39;s are always a great help, but I would understand if no one did donate as this will be my first project and I&#39;m learning.

[center]Donators:[/center]

[center]Donator 1[/center]
[center]Donator 2[/center]
[center]Donator 3[/center]
