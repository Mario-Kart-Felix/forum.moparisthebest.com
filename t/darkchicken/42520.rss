    <description>yes that&#39;s his username, when i saw him he was with other lvl 120+&#39;s (edgeville) but this dude could walk from point a to b, blinking so that you see his character for a split second and disappears for the other fraction of the second. He even had other people follow him the entire way while he was doing the routine. Its odd, i haven&#39;t seen anything quite like it. how does he do this though? :confused:

ps he&#39;s not a mod at the time</description>
