<p>Tbh why dose everyone love java xD learning other languages are just as easy yea delphi is a good tool if you wanted to make like editors so on so on</p>
<p>RSMV was made in delphi… RSMV editor was made in Delphi so on so on its a gd language for all dat shti lol[/quote]Because it’s way easier to learn than delphi, it isn’t dead so you can get help for it, it’s object oriented (I don’t know if delphi is or not but java is), etc etc.[quote=“adu, post:45, topic:236783”][quote author=bigh51 link=topic=312559.msg2500727#msg2500727 date=1224638190]</p>

<p>On topic - Tx, how come every time i load say…Edge. All it shows is gray with the buildings, but yet in your pictures that you have posted up there, it shows everything in color (like grass, brown areas)[/quote]If you’re bored with java, move onto C# or C/C++.</p>
