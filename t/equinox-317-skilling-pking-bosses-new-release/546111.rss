[u][size=24pt]The Start[/size][/u]
Equinox was created on August 2014 by Kryptic &amp; Nytr1x. 
This is our very first release and we would like to see how it turns out.
We dedicate lots of our time in this server to make it one of the best servers for you to enjoy.

[u][size=24pt]Server &amp; Updates[/size][/u]
We update the server frequently, our updates are based on mostly what people wants in the game.
The server will be 24/7 next month, the reason that it isn&#39;t already is because we wanted to see if it goes well or not as it is.

[u][size=24pt]Community[/size][/u]
So far there are only 2 people running the server but by time we will higher more people to work with us.

[u][size=24pt]Features[/size][/u]
Working combat with all specials also working.
Duel Arena
Lots of bosses
All Skills work
Perfectly working prayers
&amp; Much more...
