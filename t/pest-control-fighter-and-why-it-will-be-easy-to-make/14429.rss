    <title>Pest control fighter and why it will be easy to make</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pest-control-fighter-and-why-it-will-be-easy-to-make/14429</link>
    <description>well i have been thinking about hte pest control script and how people said it will be hard, but it wont for any elite scripters. IF you want to know why its cuz they have the tokal fighter arena script. The pest control script would have to be something like that. I am not sure if i am right on that, i am just asuming. ALso i notice the script wouldnt need anti randoms as you areina mini game most of the time
I am not a leecher by the way and i do not abuse scripts.  I tried to make a script before its way to confusing for me.</description>
