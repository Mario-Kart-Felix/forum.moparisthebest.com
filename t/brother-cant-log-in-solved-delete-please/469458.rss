    <title>Brother can&#39;t log in. (SOLVED DELETE PLEASE)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/brother-cant-log-in-solved-delete-please/469458</link>
    <description>Alright so i have a server, it&#39;s online people are always online, but when my brother tries to log in (on the same ip as me) it won&#39;t let him connect.
i think that this is because we are on the same ip so my question is how do i fix this?</description>
