    <description>This is to prove Figment can be turned into a good source.
:)  :D  :P  ;D



Day #1:
Fixed dialogue for Desert treasure. (The guy who made it can&#39;t type WORTH SHIT!)
End of Day One.


Day #2:
Deleted Desert Treasure. (Going to re-make my way and considering is sucked anyway.)
Deleted Skillcape emotes. (WENT FROM 0.99MB TO 0.98MB!!!)
Removed colors on Ancient Magicks spells, And changed some spells names. (Aka Blood blitz was Bl00d Blitz, Ice blitz being Kyle blitz, and Ice Barrage being Figment Barrage.)[IMG]http://i478.photobucket.com/albums/rr144/Anfernio_/ancients.jpg[/img]
Removed Cape tab. (Planning to remove all non-needed tabs and add teleports in Regular magic/Ancients.)
Removed gay information on Quest tab, as I am going to add quests here. [IMG]http://i478.photobucket.com/albums/rr144/Anfernio_/ancients2.jpg[/img]
Removed the NPC Dimintheis as he is no longer needed.
Removed the colors on the tabs. (I HATED THEM SO MUCH!)[IMG]http://i478.photobucket.com/albums/rr144/Anfernio_/ancients4.jpg[/img]
Removed chat going into chatlog. (Was easy as hell.)
Removed kicklogs (What was the point of adding this, anyway?)
