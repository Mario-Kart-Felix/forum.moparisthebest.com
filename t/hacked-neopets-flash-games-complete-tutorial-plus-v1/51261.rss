    <description>Ok this is a good Neopets flash game hacking guide!!!

U need:
Flash player 7 [url=http://forum.cheatengine.org/download.php?id=2649]http://forum.cheatengine.org/download.php?id=2649[/url]
Cheat Engine [url=http://www.tucows.com/preview/335689]http://www.tucows.com/preview/335689[/url]
Do the tutorial!!!


- individual games - (all scans in double)
1- Pet pet rescue
in this game you can freeze the timer
first scan for unknown initial value
wait for time to go down search for decreased value
do this until u have under 80 addreses
finally die and search for increased value
then just freeze the value that keeps oing down by one

2- Dubloon disaster
this one is actualy very easy
you can make it so no more mines appear
get a coin so theres one mine and search for 1
get another so theres two mines and search 2
you should have like two addreses
pick one that gos to 0 when both mines go boom
now this steps important xD change value to 20 dont freeze

woot another 1 ... e z and effective you can change the value of dubloons
look at the coin if its 2 search 2 if 5 5 and so on
pik it up and look at the coin that appears and search for its value
do this until you have 3 addresses and change all 3 to like 200 or w/e u want
now jus pik up the coin and voila hi score xD

3- Bumber Cars
in this one you can actualy edit score and not freeze &gt;_&lt;
finish 1 round and search for your score
finish another round and search again
change that value to a reasonable amount
remember no hi score or ban ^^

4- Meerca chase
this is a lot of hassle to hack but easy if your fast
start game (hard and medium is almost impossible)
get one negg so you have 1 thing following you
search for 1
get another 1 and search 2
now you should have a cople addreses if not get 1 more and search 3
finally change the value to zero and freeze
no more white thing will follow you

5- Sophie&#39;s Stew
you can do &quot;god mode&quot; on this one lol
search for 5 as soon as you start
loose a life and search for four (3 if you loose 2, etc.)
now freeze the value at 3 4 or 5 and you have infinite lives

6- Petpet cannonball
you can do an easy infinite try hack for this one
you stat of with 10 tries but dont scan yet, use a try
search for 9 and loose another try
search for 8 and look through the addreses and find the 8
ignore the 8.00001, 8.1111, etc.
now dont freeze it but change it to 99 or 50 or w/e u want xD

7- evil fuzzles from beyond the stars
wow so many crap you can do for this one so lets start with infinite credits
first of complete a round and at the buy screen search for how many credits you have
compleate another round and search again
then change that value to like 1000 or w/e
(its better not to freeze cause that messes the game up sometimes

ok now we can do an even easier hack ... infinte amo, mines, etc
pick an item u want a lot of for example smart bombs
buy three and search three
buy like two more and search 5
now you should have 2 addresses make them both a high number
remember its better not to freeze

finally infite armor/health
search for the amount of armor you have
now playa round and loose some and search for that value
now do this until you only have several addresses
lastly just freeze the results and yay for god mode

8- chemistry for begginers
you can do 2 useful things with this game
first of you can have unlimited tries
look at how many tries you have and search for that #
then use 1 and search for that value
do this until you have 1 address and freeze

you can also make the element which is next anything you want (for example red, blue, etc.)
ok when the next elements is green search for one
now keep using elements until the one your about to use is blue and scan for 2
now narrow the address list down to 4-1 by scaning 1 for green and 2 for blue, or 3 for red
finally just change that value to what you want
1 will give you green element
2 will give you blue element
3 will give you red element
(if you dont know what i mean by element just play the game you&#39;ll see)


- General Game Hacking -

1- score editing
since there are many games i wont waste my time trying all of them but rather teach you how to do it
here is how you can edit the score for games
ok this can only be done on a few games
all you have to do is scan for your score and then wait until it changes and scan again
now if you get 1 address you cant change the score
but if you get 2 - 3 addresses then you probobly can just change all of the values to the score you want
but most games freeze when you do this, you jut have to find the right ones

2- freeze timer
this can be useful for many games
the only problem is that this often takes a while, but if you have the time go for it
scan first with unknown initial value
wait for the timer to go down 3-4 seconds and scan for decreased value
continue doing this until you have a visible list of addresses
finally freeze the one thats obviously your time (it will keep going down by one and be the same # as your timer)

Also post any problems or games that u hacked (include how u done it the the name of the game).
