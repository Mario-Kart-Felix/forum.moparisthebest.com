    <description>Avatar (2009) - James Cameron.

I&#39;m not good with reviews, especially with a movie so brilliant and visually captivating as Avatar where I get entirely caught up in the moment of every second.
What I can say, is definitely go see this movie.. It is absolutely outstanding.
I felt myself contributing a complete empathetic standpoint and a continuance of overwhelming emotions towards the feature.
The movie was everything I expected, and much more. Definitely a new generation and level of filming that dominates well above the rest in aspects of 3D, landscaping and an out-of-world experience.

&quot;Whatever way you choose to look at it, Avatar&#39;s shock and awe demand to be seen. You&#39;ve never experienced anything like it, and neither has anyone else.&quot;

&quot;Avatar, essentially, is a film we’ve seen before, boldly made to look like nothing we’ve seen before. It is truly the Star Wars of our age.&quot;

&quot;James Cameron, in his first feature film since &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1997, has the right to reclaim the title of King of the (Cinematic) World with this monumental epic.&quot;

[b]Facts[/b]

# The movie is 40% live action and 60% photo-realistic CGI.
# As of December 2009, with an alleged budget of US $230,000,000 (estimated), this is the most expensive movie ever made.
# James Cameron&#39;s first feature film since Titanic (1997).

              <p>I saw it in 3d a few nights ago. I found it to be very good, but the plot was predictable and reminiscent of District 9 (neither of these is necessarily a bad thing, but they’re not necessarily a good thing, either). Like Lothy said, I was very happy to see the strong anti-capitalist messages portrayed in the film. Ironic, but still awesome <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Just got back from watching the late session. Despite what many have said above, I think it’ll remain one of the best movies I’ve seen in a long time, for a long time.</p>
<p>The art was truly beautiful. Never before has an alien world in film been captured with such authenticity.<br>
It’s not even close to comparable to the various planets in Star Wars that found their way into the Star Wars film franchise, such as Coruscant and Naboo. Star Wars planets were human-like to the core; at best, they were human worlds of tomorrow. And that includes the worlds that weren’t populated by humans.<br>
Pandora, the moon in the film, was the opposite of any human world. It wasn’t developed, it was lush, and very much alive; it showed no signs of being populated by almost parasitic equilibrium-avoiding humans.<br>
And in that way, it was beautiful.</p>
<p>I believe that Elijah made a comment about the movie being incomplete, and not deep enough.<br>
I disagree with this. Highlight the following text to read, but beware: POTENTIAL SPOILER.<br>
The reasoning for the lack of coexistence was extremely obvious from the moment the word ‘mining’ was uttered. This doesn’t need a back story, or explaining of any sort, if you’re a forward thinking person. How would you react if someone came in to your house and, essentially, told you to fuck off – perhaps because there was oil under your land. Well that’s what happened in this movie.</p>
<p>Elijah also mentioned that a couple of ‘important issues’ were missed. I’m curious as to what these issues are.<br>
Once again, potential SPOILER ALERT. Highlight the following text if you’ve seen the movie or have no qualms with potentially ruining parts of it for yourself.<br>
The central idea conveyed by the movie is that humans are arrogant enough to think that they know what’s best for everyone, ignorant enough to write anyone else that is ‘different’ off as brutes or savages, and then arrogant enough to try to force their opinions and lifestyles on to others through any means necessary.<br>
The second idea conveyed, in my opinion, is the danger and far-reaching consequences of capitalism.<br>
I’m not sure if it’s an intentional message (it seems very un-American), but it’s certainly there for those who aren’t blind enough to miss it.<br>
The movie suggests, probably correctly, that humans will stop at nothing to line their pockets; even if it means the destruction of a people.<br>
The concept has been explored in other movies. The film ‘Shooter’ comes to mind, seeing as I watched it again a few days ago.</p>
<p>The story line is there and the depth is there, with regards to both characters and environment.<br>
It sounds like people were too distracted by the visuals to take it all in. But don’t get me wrong, the visuals alone are worth nothing less than your full attention.<br>
However instead of writing the movie off as ‘incomplete’ or, ‘visually stunning but that’s all it has going for it…’, consider this: The director MAY just respect you enough to assume that you have the brains to ‘cotton on’ to what’s happening.<br>
It’s no secret that most movies and television shows have been dumbed down for the plebs.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Elijah, post:16, topic:320626”]I just saw it for the first time in 3D, and it really was way too much to take in at one time. Not only trying to adjust to seeing things in 3D but trying to pay attention to all that was going on. There was never enough time to appreciate each little detail, the nuances, symbols, allusions, metaphors, all the things that make a movie a cult classic.</p>
<p>I can’t wholeheartedly say this now, but the movie felt incomplete. I mean don’t get me wrong the movie definitely looked amazing. But it felt like that was all it had going for it. The plot lacked real depth, and I felt like the movie really missed some important issues. I understand that not a lot could be accomplished in only 162 minutes, which really ruined what the movie had going for it.</p>
<p>I want there to be a sequel, but the sequels are never really as good as the first. There’s so much of this world James Cameron has created, that is still left to be explored. They didn’t spend enough time developing the characters, and telling their background, which was a real disappointment. It felt like they threw everyone in together and never really let us understand why they didn’t coexist, or why they felt a certain way about something.</p>
<p>If anything I would have rather seen this movie take 5 hours to play through, and then leave it feeling like the movie was complete, rather than a bunch of explored ideas left well, mostly unexplored. I’m definitely going to go see it again, probably in 2D though.[/quote]<br>
I agree with you for the most part. It would be hard though to fit everything in to that time frame, some reviews complained the movie was even too long. An extended/uncut copy would have been nice, maybe for the DVD.</p>
<p>3D was amazing, like I expected. Just that it takes some time to adjust, so much is going on and 3D forces you to focus on what they want you too. When your eyes oblige you get strain.</p>
<p>Loved it just as much the second way through, though. I want to see it at the IMAX theater.</p>
