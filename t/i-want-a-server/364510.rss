    <title>I want a Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-want-a-server/364510</link>
    <description>Hi ive been looking for a bit now but I cant seem to find a good server to start out with so if someone could post a link to one on here that would be great and a link to a tutorial of how I can make it mine like what files to change and how I can make a friend play it and all that because I have 0 java coding experience so any help would be greately appreciated. Oh and I like 317 servers but if its a newer version that would be good too as long as its easy to find all the files and I dont have to search for hours to change all the last owners names to mine :P tyvm.</description>

lolz ok I was looking for blank but not nothing XD I would never be able to make it. Got any others that are bare but still work in all the original stuff like pvp and fighting and drop all on death on skull and stuff like that not blank XP</p>

[/quote]</p>
<p>more specific…<br>
a server with an economy?<br>
a plain-old pking server?<br>
skilling only?<br>
what are you looking for?[/quote]<br>
hmmm whats an economy server? I sorta want a skills added server but who doesnt like abit of killing ever once in a while <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> so yea a bit of everything and if theres minigames in it and customs ill take it becasue I want them there and it will save me alot of time figuring out how to put them in oh and dclaws with full spec is required. More specific hmmm ook ummm i want me to be owner and not some hidden code smwhere making the original owner of the server the owner and me a coowner I want a home, working teles that I can change if I want to and commands lke item spawn and no clip and I like the godmode command like on some servers its fun to fly around and the rest of the commands that all the servers have and yell for the mods admins and owner not for normal members but it can be changed maybe a vip area and a bunch of working bosses like kbd and godwars maybe not full god wars but like the bosses that will drop the hilts and blades if any of this can be done by me when I have the server plz link a how to tutorial but if it has as many things on it as possible so like close to complete but i can still add npcs and change stuff on it I would really appreciate it if u do find one like this. Oh and if it does have commands i want to be able to type in ::commands and see them all for every rank you are. Hope that was specific enough if not I can add or expand on some of these ideas <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> ty  again.</p>

              <p>my advice is to start just look and find one that you can skill and pk on. even if it looks bare and plain you can add items for skilling add customs and build it up. plus building it up will also get you better at coding. and sorry i cand link you to a server cause i honestly dont feel like looking for one, but just get one that you think is alright and build it up:) i will look for one in a bit that i think will be good:)</p>

<p>Hi ive been looking for a bit now but I cant seem to find a good server to start out with so if someone could post a link to one on here that would be great and a link to a tutorial of how I can make it mine like what files to change and how I can make a friend play it and all that because I have 0 java coding experience so any help would be greately appreciated. Oh and I like 317 servers but if its a newer version that would be good too as long as its easy to find all the files and I dont have to search for hours to change all the last owners names to mine <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> tyvm.</p>
