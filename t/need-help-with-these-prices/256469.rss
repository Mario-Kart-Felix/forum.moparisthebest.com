    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-these-prices/256469</link>
    <description>Well yeah, i recently added some custom items, but when i try adding them to item.cfg it errors, i have everything correct, models etc, they are on my server but are 1gp. Can someone help me with this, changing the price of them, obviously i can&#39;t use item.cfg because they aren&#39;t in there.

I am using delta base.</description>
