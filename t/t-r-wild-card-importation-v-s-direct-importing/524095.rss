    <description>[size=24pt][i][color=red]Wild-Card Importation V.S. Direct Importing[/i][/size]




Hello, and thank you very much for reading this Thread. 

As a lot of you may know, I left MoparScape for a brief period of time, but now I have returned. As an apology for my absence, I took the liberty of releasing a 110K.B. Think Tank design for R.S.P.S, which you can find [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,642630.0.html][u]here.[/u][/url]
 
I hope that someone finds that useful, and now, without further ado, I will give my take on &#39;Wild-Card Importation V.S. Direct Importing&#39;. I would like to say that I&#39;m not &#39;dissing&#39; one or the other, as they&#39;re both functional, and they both perform their jobs well. I&#39;m simply listing Pros and Cons without bias. Let&#39;s take a moment to peak at some lines of code, shall we?


[code=Java]
package com.world;

import com.repack.NPC.*;
import com.pack.core.Client;
import com.pack.player.Player;
[/code]


Now, you may look at this and say, &quot;Jack, I don&#39;t see anything wrong&quot;, or, &quot;These lines of code don&#39;t need to be re-written or improved upon&quot;. 

Let&#39;s take a closer look, except we won&#39;t need to look at the package directory, so we&#39;ll leave that out:


[code=Java]
import com.repack.NPC.*;
import com.pack.core.Client;
import com.pack.player.Player;
[/code]


As you can see, one of the Imports is using an asterisk syntax. The use of a Wild-Card Import (the asterisk syntax) denotes that ALL files inside of the corresponding directory shall be Imported. The other two Imports shown, are specific Direct Imports. I&#39;m sure there are users who will argue that there is no difference between the two, but I can assure you, that is just simply not the case. I&#39;m now going to list both the Pros and the Cons of each of the two:




[size=24pt]Pros:[/size]


1. Organization: When you&#39;re using Direct Imports - you know EXACTLY which file you&#39;re incorporating. This also makes it easier for human eyes to scan, enables you to instantly recognize which file you&#39;re Importing, and you aren&#39;t including 5 unnecessary files to access one file.

2. Clutter: It&#39;s no secret that R.S.P.S. are notoriously messy and unorganized. This is taking a step in the right direction, however, there is another side to this &#39;plus&#39; as well -- which will be covered very shortly.

3. Familiarity: When using Direct Imports, you will become more familiar with your Source, Classes, Methods, Conditions, and lines of code. The more knowledge you have of what you&#39;re working with, the more capable you can become.

4. I.D.E. Knows That Feel, Bro: I&#39;ve found that some people dislike this function. When using a modern I.D.E, it can and will convert Wild-Card Import statements into Direct Imports. EDIT : ADDED BY HcoJustin  : This is IDE dependent. IntelliJ IDEA will prefer direct imports until you reach a certain threshold (Default: 50), or you are in a specified package (Default: javax.swing). It is certainly possible to turn it off, and I&#39;m sure Eclipse and Netbeans have similar features that are easily configured. 

6. Build-Time: Although this will most likely cause a large argument, converting Wild-Card Imports to Direct Imports CAN reduce your Build (Compile) time.



[size=24pt]Cons:[/size]

1. Clutter: Previously, when writing up the &#39;Pros&#39; for utilizing Direct Imports, I mentioned that using them is a step in the right direction - towards organization. However, like I said, there is another ugly side to this. When listing multiple imports, you will start to accumulate a long list of Direct Imports. In this case, a Wild-Card Import would be more practical than a long list of Direct Imports.

2. Absent Class: When using a Direct Import, the specific file you&#39;re attempting to Import MUST exist. If you&#39;re using a Wild-Card Import, then this is simply not the case.

3. When using Wild-Card Imports, you could run into a Naming Conflict. This usually occurs when two files in the same directory have the same name. 




In closing, I would like to reiterate once more... I&#39;m not saying that one of these is better than the other (although I most certainly have my preferences). I would just like to point out that both of these functions have their uses, and both should be utilized according to situations.

<p>No, there aren’t really any MAJOR reasons. You shouldn’t just take my point of view though. There are a load of people who are biased towards one side or the other. I believe it should be situational because that’s how it was designed to be.</p>

<p>Are there any other MAJOR reasons as to why you should use direct imports besides compiling speed?</p>
<p>As I did point out to you though in a class like my player/client/server class I will almost always use wild cards just for the simple fact that it would get messy if I literally placed every single file into it.</p>
<p>Good tutorial though!</p>

</aside>
<p>I’m not arguing with you, and I agree that It’s a confined topic, however. I believe this is a better and more dumbed down explanation than those explained in documents. A lot of our newbie users don’t know where to go to find information like this, so they just browse MoparScape looking for Tutorials and such. If I can help one person learn about this, then I’ve accomplished the goal of the Tutorial. There are also many Bases which are covered up in Wild-Card Imports – often times importing 5+ files just to nab one. Although their projects might be small, and the difference might not be noteworthy, it probably is still having a small impact on Build-time. I agree with you, like I said, but I found a lot of reasons to write this Tutorial, and hardly any convincing me otherwise. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Knows That Feel, Bro: I’ve found that some people dislike this function. When using a modern I.D.E, it can and will convert Wild-Card Import statements into Direct Imports.<br>

This is IDE dependant. IntelliJ IDEA will prefer direct imports until you reach a certain threshold (Default: 50), or you are in a specified package (Default: javax.swing). It is certainly possible to turn it off, and I’m sure Eclipse and Netbeans have similar features that are easily configured.</p>
<p>There are no conventions directly related to this topic, so it is all a matter of personal preference.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ll be sure to include this. Thank you for your contribution.</p>
