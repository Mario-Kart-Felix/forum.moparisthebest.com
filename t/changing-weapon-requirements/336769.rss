    <title>Changing weapon requirements</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-weapon-requirements/336769</link>
    <description>Hey, ok well I want too change the requirements for a weapon. It is a weapon meant for admins only and to make sure no one else can use, I want to set the attack lvl required to 100, because when you become an admin you&#39;re attack is set to 100, no one else can get this. So only admins can wear it. 

How do I edit the weapon&#39;s requirements?</description>
