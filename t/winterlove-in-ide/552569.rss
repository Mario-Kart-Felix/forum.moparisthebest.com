    <title>WinterLove In IDE</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/winterlove-in-ide/552569</link>
    <description>Hi, so this weird WinterLove client I found is quite strange. I&#39;m using BlueJ because my computer sucks and I needed a starter IDE. The client is split into two main sections src and bin folders, but BlueJ can only read a project if both java files and class files are in one folder and not separate. So I made a new folder and copied each of the class and java files into it into one massive folder so that blueJ could properly read it. When I opened up the project, I tried finding a way to run the client and obviously the first thing I went to was the class/file named &quot;client&quot; the only problem though is that when I run it it&#39;s just displaying a console window and it says it&#39;s an applet. I know that the client can run and everything can work someway I just don&#39;t know how because the client came with a .bat run file and .bat compile file, the compile bat didn&#39;t work but the run file to get the client up and going did. So what am I missing here or what did I mess up on? Is it possible I just ran the wrong file? If so what file should I run to get the client running in an IDE? Thanks - EJ</description>

<p>No, clearly I haven’t. And if it’s making you do that, it’s probably not a very good IDE in general, and you should consider switching…</p>

<p>I’m actually really confused how your IDE requires the class files to be in the same directory as the java source files… Because that is <span class="bbcode-b">not</span> how projects should be set up.<br>
The source should be in src (or a folder of similar meaning) and the compiled binaries should be in the bin folder (or similar).</p>
<p>When you opened the project in the IDE, did you make sure to select the folder containing the src and bin folders?</p>
