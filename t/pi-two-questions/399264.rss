              <p>thanks so much for the tip i got the if u have 70 in all skills working now i just need maxhit one</p>
<p>btw, i mean to only add 1 int i want to know when they hit that number just once when in game cause if they had a 20 one time they get an easy achievement done</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I think the max hit one is just about right but instead of = you would want to put &gt;= so it make it so if it hits 20 or any number above it, it would add the int. Also for the int thing you would want to put += instead of = cause that would keep it at 1 unless that how you want it. I don’t know/think thats the right method though… You might have to make a new one.</p>
<p>The second one you would need to make it so everytime you level, it would add one. same thing with above for where it adds the number, += instead of =.</p>
<p>Hope I could help some, not going to spoon feed <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
