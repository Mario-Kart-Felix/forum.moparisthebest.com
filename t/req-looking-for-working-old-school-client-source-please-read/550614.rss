    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-looking-for-working-old-school-client-source-please-read/550614</link>
    <description>Hey guys!!..

I&#39;m looking to start my own rsps with VPS domain etcetc, however I have browsed the forum and can&#39;t really seem to find a working client and source as they seem to all have errors or things missing, would really love it if someone could link me to a working one?, preferably with commands already added?.

Also: anyone know if there is still any clients out there from rsps from like 6 years ago where you could just hit dummies and level?, loved them!.

Also Also: If anyone wants to be part of my rsps as in help create, add things etccc, feel free too message me please

THANKYOU</description>
