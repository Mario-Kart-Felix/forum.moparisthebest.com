    <description>when i register a server it gives me this


New server  succesfully entered, however it will not show up on the list until it has been verified and approved.
Your server will now be checked by logging into it with the following credentials: 


to make sure it is online, and if successful, it will be posted. 
You must register this username and password for me on your server and allow it to be logged into from the IP
The server will be deleted from the queue if not verified and logged into within 24 hours of posting.


what does it mean &quot;register this username and password for me on your server and allow it to be logged into from ip &quot; (i took off username and pass for some reasons)
Tell me how to register it.</description>
