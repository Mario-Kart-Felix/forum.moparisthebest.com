    <description>Hi,
Im having a problem with my server that is running on a vps well first of all it was running fine the day before and I haven&#39;t changed anything since then and today I cant get on the server and so cant any of my players... I have my server running and everything in my vps and all that but the weird part is when you click log in it goes to a black screen only showing the chat box and your inventory but right after you get kicked... In my runserver CMD it says,&quot;REGISTERED ----&quot; but then like 3 seconds after it kicks you and say, &quot;DEREGISTERED ----&quot;.. So it was working before as I said and I haven&#39;t changed anything so I dont know what going on.. Please help!!?

Thanks ALOT!@</description>

              <p>I have restarted the server many times, check the ports, check my ip, everything but I think it might on been a player that did something… I copied and deleted all the character files so there where no accounts on my server but it still didn’t work… How to f*** do I fix this!? Lol</p>

<p>Have you restarted the server?<br>
Sometimes, assuming you have active players, someone could have accidentally caused a run time error in the server that didn’t directly glitch it right away. But it did eventually. Then you lost sight of it because people kept playing and it went off the cmd’s screen.<br>
That’s the only thing I could think of without any prior information.</p>
