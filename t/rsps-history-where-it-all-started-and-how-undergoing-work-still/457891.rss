    <title>RSPS History! Where it all started, and how. (undergoing work still)</title>

    <description>Okay!
I found a load of information. Here&#39;s what I got. Credits to the people who made this stuff below.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credit to BlakeMan8192 for the below paragraphs:
&quot;
The history is very hazy, as Kaitnieks and the other important places in the history of RSPS are now gone.

As far as we know, this is the first RS2 private server ever made: http://www.moparisthebest.com/origrs2/

It was developed by wL, and it&#39;s known commonly as the &quot;winterlove&quot; server base.

After that release, Daiki took it and through lots of research/development, made a multiplayer server called BlakeScape.

BlakeScape is the grandfather of RuneScape private servers.

At that moment, things start to get blurry as dozens of programmers took the original BlakeScape and developed their bases off of it. The main release that emerged from the original BlakeScape was called MythScape. 
Wolf then took MythScape and built several versions of WhtieScape, which Xerozcheez then used to make Cheezscape. Cheezscape was the dominating server base in the 2007 era, the last version being Cheezscape 80.
After this line of servers up to Cheezscape, they were split into three highly popular bases: Project 16, Testscape, and Dodian. Dodian didn&#39;t emerge until later, and originally it was just Project 16 and Testscape for a long time.

From Dodian came Devolution, and then DeltaScape (which is currently the most popular server base). From Testscape emerged Pimpscape, which has now died out for the most part.

If you&#39;re wondering about how well I know this stuff, I&#39;m responsible for the RuneFusion, RuneFusion Final Build, and Enkrona servers on that chart. Enkrona had several versions (2.5, 2.6, and 3.2 I believe were all released to the mainstream) that aren&#39;t mentioned on this chart. Not to toot my own horn, but I&#39;ve also been around RSPS for quite a while now.

Many people have made attempts to re-create the original server base (some examples in chronological order: Google by me and Graham, rs2d by Varek, rs2hd by Graham, Hyperion by Graham, 317serv by Yz85Racer, Casey, and rs377d by me, Apollo by Graham which is not yet released, and I&#39;ve developed several unreleased servers from scratch, including Osiris) with something more stable and efficient than BlakeScape, but most of them have either failed or their server bases have failed to gain mainstream attention. My theory is that their server bases are too complicated for a majority of programmers to use, and hopefully I&#39;ll be solving this problem soon with an open-source server I&#39;ve been working on in my spare time known as RuneSource. It&#39;s meant to resemble the original BlakeScape, but be far more stable, scalable, and efficient.

Hopefully that answers some of your questions! I&#39;m glad to see genuine interest in our history. 

Flow chart credit to Graham (I added in project Insanity, obviously.):

Timeline credit to me:

Some history of significant server releases (in chronological order):
Winterlove (first release)
Blakescape (multiplayer)
Mythscape (some early content)
Cheezscape (combat, npcs, etc)
Whitescape (improved content)
p16 (even more improved content)
rs2dv (entire new release)
Hyperion (first commercial scale performance release)


That&#39;s all I have at the moment, feel free to add.</description>

              <h2>Okay!<br>
I found a load of information. Here’s what I got. Credits to the people who made this stuff below.</h2>
<p>Credit to BlakeMan8192 for the below paragraphs:<br>
"<br>
The history is very hazy, as Kaitnieks and the other important places in the history of RSPS are now gone.</p>
<p>As far as we know, this is the first RS2 private server ever made: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/origrs2/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/origrs2/</a></p>
<p>It was developed by wL, and it’s known commonly as the “winterlove” server base.</p>
<p>After that release, Daiki took it and through lots of research/development, made a multiplayer server called BlakeScape.</p>
<p>BlakeScape is the grandfather of RuneScape private servers.</p>
<p>At that moment, things start to get blurry as dozens of programmers took the original BlakeScape and developed their bases off of it. The main release that emerged from the original BlakeScape was called MythScape.<br>
Wolf then took MythScape and built several versions of WhtieScape, which Xerozcheez then used to make Cheezscape. Cheezscape was the dominating server base in the 2007 era, the last version being Cheezscape 80.<br>
After this line of servers up to Cheezscape, they were split into three highly popular bases: Project 16, Testscape, and Dodian. Dodian didn’t emerge until later, and originally it was just Project 16 and Testscape for a long time.</p>
<p>From Dodian came Devolution, and then DeltaScape (which is currently the most popular server base). From Testscape emerged Pimpscape, which has now died out for the most part.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering about how well I know this stuff, I’m responsible for the RuneFusion, RuneFusion Final Build, and Enkrona servers on that chart. Enkrona had several versions (2.5, 2.6, and 3.2 I believe were all released to the mainstream) that aren’t mentioned on this chart. Not to toot my own horn, but I’ve also been around RSPS for quite a while now.</p>
<p>Many people have made attempts to re-create the original server base (some examples in chronological order: Google by me and Graham, rs2d by Varek, rs2hd by Graham, Hyperion by Graham, 317serv by Yz85Racer, Casey, and rs377d by me, Apollo by Graham which is not yet released, and I’ve developed several unreleased servers from scratch, including Osiris) with something more stable and efficient than BlakeScape, but most of them have either failed or their server bases have failed to gain mainstream attention. My theory is that their server bases are too complicated for a majority of programmers to use, and hopefully I’ll be solving this problem soon with an open-source server I’ve been working on in my spare time known as RuneSource. It’s meant to resemble the original BlakeScape, but be far more stable, scalable, and efficient.</p>
<p>Hopefully that answers some of your questions! I’m glad to see genuine interest in our history.</p>

<p>Some history of significant server releases (in chronological order):<br>
Winterlove (first release)<br>
Blakescape (multiplayer)<br>
Mythscape (some early content)<br>
Cheezscape (combat, npcs, etc)<br>
Whitescape (improved content)<br>
p16 (even more improved content)<br>
rs2dv (entire new release)<br>
Hyperion (first commercial scale performance release)</p>
<p>That’s all I have at the moment, feel free to add.</p>
