    <title>The cache doesnt unzip for me</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-cache-doesnt-unzip-for-me/435243</link>
    <description>okay so it loads if i manually put the cache in the user drive, however if i try to get it from the link it doesn&#39;t go past 0% though it went to 1% but now it won&#39;t load past 0% again, does any1 have any idea, and do you need me to post anything here such as signlink or cachedownloader?</description>
