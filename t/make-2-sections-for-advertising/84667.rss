    <title>Make 2 sections for advertising?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/make-2-sections-for-advertising/84667</link>
    <description>Well, pretty much every single thread i look at , its a server leeched from someone else.

I think you shud make 2 sub forums, 

One for so called &quot;Leeched&quot; servers, and another for servers that you have made completely yourself, or close enough...

Cause seriously i just been going through them the last 5 minutes, an a shit load of them have the name &quot;isle&quot; in it, from that satan&#39;s isle source , or w/e it is.

Can no one make there own servers these days?
Wat do u all think ?</description>

              <p>That wont happen, every server is leeched from a source lol.<br>
Do you know how hard it is to code a server from scratch lol ?<br>
But there is too many satan isle’s in there, just being a source.</p>
