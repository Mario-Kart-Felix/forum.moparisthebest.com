    <title>Domain without address?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/domain-without-address/133290</link>
    <description>Are their any websites to create a .com website that doesnt need your address? I go to godaddy.com and they need your address to buy a domain.. are their any websites that don&#39;t need your address? Because I don&#39;t feel comfortable giving them that personal of information.</description>

<p>I know this is a trusted site and all, but they scammed me mainly because of their lack of customer support. I had put something like 20 dollars into my account for domains. Then I bought one(was going to buy some more later). At the time I was sharing a paypal account with someone and he reversed the payment and tried to steal my money since I quit working on a project that we were making. Anyways so namecheap banned me and said to reverse the reversed charge to get unbanned(lol, sounds confusing). So I did, I sent them back the 20-something dollars and they never unbanned me and they won’t return emails. Paypal wouldn’t let me reverse the payment again. So I lost 20 bucks =/ Shit I went way off topic lol.[/quote]That is confusing lolo , I’m just sticking with <a href="http://godaddy.com" rel="nofollow noopener">godaddy.com</a></p>

<p>Don’t worry, if you’re paying then they shouldn’t give out your details to anyone. The most that will happen is you will get some spam via snail mail, but I doubt it because the majority of spam now days is electronic. and you’re welcome.</p>
