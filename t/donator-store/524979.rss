There is already “donator credits:” how do I hook up a store with that? If I use any donator tutorial will it deduct points off the quest tab donator credits to? could somebody help me. Thanks…<br>

<p>First off, if the points are spent the quest tabs showing of the amount of points will automatically update because it reads from their amount of points saved in their player file, and that gets reduced upon spending. I hope that sentence made sense, I’m in a rush. On making the shop you need to first link an npc with the shop.</p>
<p>Go into ActionHandler.java and if you want the player to have to click “Trade” on the npc or whatever, go to the method named “secondClickNpc”. But if you want it to just be “Talk to” and it opens the shop, do this part in firstClickNpc.</p>
<p>add this in whichever method you chose anywhere under the switch method:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case ####: //npc id
c.getShops().openShop(##); //shop id
break;</code></pre>
<p>That will make clicking the npc open the shop.</p>
<p>Now I’ve spoonfed you enough so I’m gonna be less specific in this next part.</p>
<p>Go to ShopAssistant and copy the code from any other shop and just switch the numbers accordingly. Also go to getSpecialItemValue and for every item in the shop you need to add a new case, and make it cost x amount of points. So here’s an example:</p>
<p><code>
case ###: //item id
return ##; //amount of points</code>[/quote]<br>
Okay I did that, but it does not go off quest tab… I can buy all i want from donor store with 100 credits… 50credits a piece… it says it cost 50credits, but in fact it uses cash… Why!</p>
