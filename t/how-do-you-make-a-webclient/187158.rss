    <title>How do you make a webclient?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-you-make-a-webclient/187158</link>
    <description>Yes, I know you are all thinking, &quot;GTFO and dont be lazy. Search it.&quot;. Well I did do that, on google and the forums and most of it was junk. Its probably deep in the files, but that would take forever to find. So if you know how to make a webclient or have one, please tell me the process. I have a website and a client for my server, just dont know how to put it all together. Thanks.</description>
