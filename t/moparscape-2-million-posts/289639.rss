<p>The only time I ever talked to you was on the IRC, and since you never come on there anymore it is hard to talk to you. I guess I talked to you on MSN sometimes, but I rarely use MSN anymore.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@jc</span>, I have no problem with you either, the reason I don’t talk to you guys as much anymore is because I work 8 hours a day, then come home and can only be on the computer a few hours before I pass out.<br>

You have no problem with me; why would you? It is I who has a problem with your change in character.[/quote]</p>
<p>I haven’t changed one bit, if you care to remember, I flamed you from time to time long before a become a moderator. I never really had/have a problem with you, or anyone for that matter, and I honestly think that I haven’t changed since I became a moderator. I guess everyone else can be the judge of that however.</p>

Newty knew that you are P_1_M_P_3_D_Tut. How else would he have guessed you on the first try? He’s pretending he didn’t know so you wouldn’t be offended. Newty has been all cocky ever since he got promoted, although I don’t respect him anymore.</p>

Why would I be jealous of Mod status. These forums don’t need mods. They barely do anything. The only mod that does anything around here is Taharok. The other mods just flame and say “HAY FKU NIGGER ASS SHIT” but you can’t argue back because of a thing called “Rank”. Why the fuck would I want to be mod? On to your ‘G.E’. I don’t think you’ve seen my 525 Grand exchange. Almost perfect. You probably fucking leached yours from rune(LOLWUTCENSOR)server.<br>

<p>For the last time, I don’t go prancing around declaring my post count.  And I only type one to two sentences max, because when you post more when <span class="bbcode-b">helping someone</span>, they lose your point and your help becomes pointless.  Sorry for being smart.  And don’t freak on `Lewk_ because he knows what he’s doing.</p>
