    <description>[b][i]So here we are my fellow runescapers, Im here to happily tell you that i will be launching a RSC private server, my focuses will be pking and skilling and i will also support many other events, there is a large list of features already in place and they are constantly being updated daily.[/i][/b]

I am excited to announce that we will have a subscription system. Im even happier to announce that i do not want your money for subscriptions. i will be implementing a Item Drop Like subscription Certificates, at a set amount you will get to sub.

[b][i]If your worried about a server that might not be around in a few years stop there.
I have been playing runescape for many many years and have stayed true to Rsc. Find your home here with protected character logs so you will never lose your accounts and items.
[/i][/b]
What are you waiting for Jump on and sign in and check out some of the cool features already added!
[i][b]Sign up on the forum and start playing![/b][/i] www.rscdedication.com/forum
Server Rates are 8x-16x Original Rsc XP
Double Xp Events on weekends right now
Fresh economy. Not many rune items yet.
The only way to get dragon and rune is KBD and Red Dragon&#39;s Untill someone is 99 smithing.
I will be hosting a few events for rares to put them in the economy and im working on replicating the original holiday drops.

*Slayer skill*
*Castle Wars*
Batched Skills!
