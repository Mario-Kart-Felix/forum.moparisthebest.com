    <title>How do I use different clients for the same source?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-use-different-clients-for-the-same-source/543439</link>
    <description>it&#39;s a PI pretty sure 317-525 based, Vistex v7 to be specific. I have the client that goes with the source and it works, but the i have a customized client that was from the same source a while ago(i customized), and id like to use it now. But when I log in, everything around seems nulled and when i click it freezes. Now, I downloaded Galkon&#39;s client 
http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/downloads/204191-galkons-refactored-base-474-look-like.html
and i get this error when i try to log in and it just instantly logs me out
&quot;Error: T2 - 126,-1,-1 - 25,0,0 - 64,108,114,101,64,80,108,97,121,101,114,115,32,
79,110,108,105,110,101,58,32,49,10,113,105,&quot;

Basically, I have a client that is normally based off this source, and can&#39;t use it anymore. Is there something in the server&#39;s coding that&#39;s only accepting that one client? please help. If it&#39;s cache based, i&#39;m alright with working with that.</description>
