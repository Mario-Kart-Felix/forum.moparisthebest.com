    <title>Java.exe eating all my cpu all of a sudden?! -.-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-exe-eating-all-my-cpu-all-of-a-sudden/220628</link>
    <description>Okay, so i just added some item spawn points, compiled, and ran.  Right after i ran, my client lagged like HELL.  I closed runserver, and it stopped lagging.  Before i added those 2 item spawns, when i ran it didnt lag at all.  If i open taskmanager and then runserver, java.exe is using 96 - 99% of my CPU. -.-

-.-

I dont know why that was cause java to lag like a bitch.  :confused:</description>
