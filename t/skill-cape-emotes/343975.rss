    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skill-cape-emotes/343975</link>
    <description>so im trying to get skill cape emotes and i followed this tutorial and everything was fine.
except i code the compile error. &quot;Code too large&quot; Well that was finally fixed. But now when i do the emotes they are totally wrong. Like the attack cape its just a cannon at my feet. -.-
There where &quot;anims&quot; that was on the tutorial that i downloaded however it didnt say to do anything with them! Do i have to apply them some way? Please Help!</description>
