    <title>+~+~ guild fisher! +!~+~ will pay well!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/guild-fisher-will-pay-well/9620</link>
    <description>I am willing to pay well for a flawless guild fisher.

It must be able to fish lobsters, swordfish, and sharks. That&#39;s all I need.
I suggest making it with the include SRL, since in my opinion it&#39;s the best.
It must have all the anti randoms possible in SCAR.
I need it to be very undetectable, the most undetetable you can get. :)
I would love it if it is completely user friendly.(very easy to set up)

IT MUST BE FLAWLESS! Be able to run over night kind of script.

I can&#39;t think of anything else right now, but If it meets all my requirements I&#39;ll pay up to 2M, maybe higher depending on how flawless it really is.
