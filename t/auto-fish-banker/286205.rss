    <title>Auto Fish/Banker</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/auto-fish-banker/286205</link>
    <description>I use to make Scripts from scratch but I stopped. Now that I am starting again I am going to be working on an amazing Script. I just need a Fish/Banker to run while I&#39;m sleeping. Preferably one that uses feathers and is in a non-member area. It&#39;s a lot to ask for with no reward so I understand if you don&#39;t want to help me.</description>
