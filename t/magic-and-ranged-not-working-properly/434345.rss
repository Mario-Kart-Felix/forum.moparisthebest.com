    <description>Ranged problems:
-Against monsters it isnt ranged
-Hits low on monsters (like 120 max with c c&#39;bow) and a bit higher on pvp (250 was my max hit) but still not enough (THE BONUSES ARE THERE) I think the problem is that it loads the melee bonuses, like loading Slash Stab and Crush isntead of loading Ranged bonuses

Magic problems:
-Against monsters it isnt ranged
-I am not sure of this but I think it also hits low, if you can fix ranged problem try this also :)

My combat is not really good, if you can add a decent combat with good ranged magic and melee I would be apreaciated</description>
