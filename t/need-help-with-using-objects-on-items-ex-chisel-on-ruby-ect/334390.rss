    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-using-objects-on-items-ex-chisel-on-ruby-ect/334390</link>
    <description>Ok its been a while since i was last coding my server then i deleted it. But anyways in my old server i had alot of using chisels on different gems and stuff, simple things like that. Say you&#39;d use a chisel on a sapphire it would cut the sapphire have the animation and make it into (replaceitem) with a ammulet of magic. Same goes for using a tinderbox on logs and it would make a fire. I totally forgot how to do this so can anyone please help me and make a code? Any help would be appreciated thanks!</description>
