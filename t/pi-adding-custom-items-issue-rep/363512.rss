    <title>[PI] Adding custom items issue [Rep++]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-adding-custom-items-issue-rep/363512</link>
    <description>1) Anyone know why a custom item would become invis when added? I added the spirit shield set, for some reason, all of them seemed to work except the Elysian Spirit Shield, which I do not understand why and i checked it over a few times. 

2) Some like body armor looked weird when you wear them. Like the whole body isn&#39;t covered.</description>
