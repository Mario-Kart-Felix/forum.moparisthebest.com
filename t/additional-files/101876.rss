    <description>Okay, I am trying to add a few things to my Server but I would like to use .txt files to help me. So, I need these questions answered please:
• How to make a command write something into a .txt file
• How to make the Server check to see if there is something already written in the .txt file
• How to make it so that if the Server finds something in the .txt file already, it activates something

Thanks!</description>
