    <title>I have had it with my network card!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-have-had-it-with-my-network-card/4288</link>
    <description>OK, I got this wireless card, the WG311v3 from netgear, this thing has given me constant trouble, it freezes up all the time in windows, and i cannot get it to work at all in linux. Netgear makes such bad products that this: 

[img]http://img47.imageshack.us/img47/2069/netgear8ao.png[/img] has happened to thier forums. I was wondering if anyone else had had this problem and knew how to fix it, i tryed getting the updated drivers from netgear, but all this did was make it so that after the card froze up windows i had to press the restart button on my computer instead of the regular restart, and it made it so that i couldn&#39;t have my welcome screen, and i had to type in username and password.

[sup]If anyone can help me, please do!!![/sup]
