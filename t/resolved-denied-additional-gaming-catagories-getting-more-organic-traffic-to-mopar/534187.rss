    <title>[RESOLVED - DENIED][Additional Gaming Catagories]Getting more Organic Traffic to Mopar</title>

    <description>[size=10pt]Howdy Moparian Staff,

I noticed that in the past year the was a huge decline of traffic to the moparscape community.
Back in 2007-2010 this community was way more live and if you had a question you were answered withing minutes by various members.
Today it is not like that, sadly.[/size]

[b]
My suggestions:[/b]

Making MoparScape  &quot;The Mother of Games&quot; or &quot;The Mother of Private Servers&quot;

I know that the original idea of MoparScape is RS Private Servers as written in the above banner,  but you guys walked a bit to the side and added MineCraft.
I think now it is the time to make MoparScape a Gaming Portal where you can be directed to different sections, each section will be different game. (The games can be chosen by searching for what people search the most in Google).

This will make the user base way more - since this community has a lot of registered users, new people that get here will register right away because they will trust that this community is for real and will succeed and will give the members what they are looking for.

I am sure many of the Mopar community are currently also playing other games or other private servers that are not RuneScape.

This is up to you.

Peace,

Sean</description>

<p>Why would they want to come to moparscape to discuss league, maple story, wow, etc when there are better alternatives?

<p>So try to name some new games that you think might blow up in the next year or so. The only one that comes to mind (I’m not an avid gamer) is DayZ mod.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks Newty,</p>
<p>I will be doing some researches of what could be the big new thing gaming wise and will post and it and you guys will tell me what you think about it…</p>
<p>Edit:    In the past hour I managed to get a source file for RoTMG, I ran it and it works well - I would like to know if there are people that would like to join in trying to make this server succeed</p>

              <p>[size=10pt]Howdy Moparian Staff,</p>
<p>I noticed that in the past year the was a huge decline of traffic to the moparscape community.<br>
Back in 2007-2010 this community was way more live and if you had a question you were answered withing minutes by various members.<br>
Today it is not like that, sadly.[/size]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
My suggestions:</span></p>
<p>Making MoparScape  “The Mother of Games” or “The Mother of Private Servers”</p>
<p>I know that the original idea of MoparScape is RS Private Servers as written in the above banner,  but you guys walked a bit to the side and added MineCraft.<br>
I think now it is the time to make MoparScape a Gaming Portal where you can be directed to different sections, each section will be different game. (The games can be chosen by searching for what people search the most in Google).</p>
<p>This will make the user base way more - since this community has a lot of registered users, new people that get here will register right away because they will trust that this community is for real and will succeed and will give the members what they are looking for.</p>
<p>I am sure many of the Mopar community are currently also playing other games or other private servers that are not RuneScape.</p>
<p>This is up to you.</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>Sean</p>
