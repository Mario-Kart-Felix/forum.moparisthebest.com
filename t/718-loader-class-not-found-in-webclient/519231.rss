    <title>[718] Loader.class not found in webclient</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-loader-class-not-found-in-webclient/519231</link>
    <description>Alright, I found out how to add my webclient to my website. (My server is 718)  Now I get this error:

[CODE]Java Plug-in 10.21.2.11
Using JRE version 1.7.0_21-b11 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
User home directory = C:\Users\Tony
----------------------------------------------------
c:   clear console window
f:   finalize objects on finalization queue
g:   garbage collect
h:   display this help message
l:   dump classloader list
m:   print memory usage
o:   trigger logging
q:   hide console
r:   reload policy configuration
s:   dump system and deployment properties
t:   dump thread list
v:   dump thread stack
x:   clear classloader cache
0-5: set trace level to &lt;n&gt;
----------------------------------------------------
[/CODE]

Anyone know how to fix this? I set my manifest to Loader because it was the only one that worked.</description>

              <p>I have never jarred a higher revision however I assume the loader class is equivalent to the client class on a 317? If so you need to make sure you put it as “loader” and not “Loader” in the manifest (sounds stupid I know…) but I had this issue before. I would put “Client” and it would give me that error.</p>

Doesn’t really warrant an infraction since there hasn’t been any warning beforehand, not that I can infract anyway, sectional problems :(.</p>
<p>OT: don’t rely on moderators to move your post, if you continue to post in the wrong board (what seems deliberately) you will be infracted then.</p>
