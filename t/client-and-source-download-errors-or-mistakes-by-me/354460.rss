    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-and-source-download-errors-or-mistakes-by-me/354460</link>
    <description>so, here i am.  
this is my problem:
     I downloaded winRAR, java JDK, etc.  I did this on my other laptop, i started a server 100% fine.  I switched laptops.  i did the SAME EXACT thing that i did on my other laptop to start a server, and there is one problem: after i download using google chrome, i click on the source and client i downloaded at the bottom of the page, and it opens in a &#39;microsoft office word document&#39;?  isn&#39;t it supposed to like...save into a RAR file that i then need to extract and then edit?  i honestly have no idea if i skipped a step in making a rsps or something, if so, just tell me what i need to do. idc if you flame this topic as long as i get an answer.  pleaseeeee help meeee.
(the reason i cant use my other laptop is because well, i basically dont own it anymore. lol)

PLEASE HELP.  :)</description>

              <p>ok some things are a bit unclear but ill try to help!</p>
<ol>
<li>are u sure the client and server you uploaded on laptop <span class="hashtag">#1</span> was the correct server and client?</li>
</ol>
<p>2.what site did u upload to?</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>on laptop <span class="hashtag">#2</span> once downloaded did the .zip or .rar file look like books or did it have a “W” logo?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>if the .zip or .rar file had a “w” or opened word when u clicked the archive then you need to right click the .zip or .rar and click “open with” choose “Other” And choose a program u want most likely “winRar”</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>were u sure that the download was 100% finished because when a download is not 100% done the extension will look like this “client.zip.part” and when u open it it will open with some weird programs. also do not think if u delete the .part it will fix the problem. it wont.</li>
</ol>
<p>if your still having problems i can connect via teamviewer just pm me the problem your having (short) and your id and pass. (Make sure u set the settings to full access) and i wll fix the problem for you.</p>
