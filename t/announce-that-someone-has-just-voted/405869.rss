    <description>I followed this tut on adding Vote4Cash: 
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,476829.msg3487607.html#msg3487607

&amp;&amp; I was wondering how I could make it where when they receive theyre award that it will shout or yell to the server that &quot;PlayerName&quot; Has Just Voted and Received 50m! Vote for you can receive your Award&quot; Something like that.. If you can help me out please do.</description>

Shit… Well, all i did was get the code from xxDestructionxx and rip half of it and just added it to that… didn’t notice it was non efficient.  And i barely even know anything about programming i just know the basic codes of PI and some other stuff.  People like you are how i learned, like this command that i just learned :D.  Also tutorials and snippets i learned alot from that, i’ve watched some Java Tutorials, but got lazy and stopped.</p>
