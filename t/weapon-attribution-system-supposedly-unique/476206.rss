    <title>Weapon Attribution System - Supposedly &#39;unique&#39;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weapon-attribution-system-supposedly-unique/476206</link>
    <description>Here&#39;s a &#39;unique&#39; system I call &#39;Weapon Attribution&#39;. Some weapons have &#39;attributes&#39;. The attributes are as followed:

[ul][li]Poison Attribute[/li]
[li]Paralyze Attribute[/li]
[li]Stun Attribute[/li][/ul]


All I could think of :P...

Let me explain them to you guys.

[hr]

[center][u][b]Poison Attribute[/b][/u][/center]

There will be certain items that will have the poison attribute. I&#39;m thinking of making the godswords one of those items. What is the poison attribute? Well, here&#39;s the concept code of it:

[code=java]
package server.content.attribution;

public class Poison {

	Client c;

	public Poison (Client c) {
		this.c = c;
	}

	private int criticalPoison = Misc.random(6);
	private int criticalPoisonNumber = 2;
	private int mainCriticalPoisonHit = 10;
	private int poison = Misc.random(4);
	private int poisonNumber = 1;

	public void appendPoisonAttribute() {
		int poisonType = Misc.random(5);
		if (poisonType == criticalPoisonNumber)
			c.doDamage(mainCriticalPoisonHit - criticalPoison);
		else if (poisonType == poisonNumber)
			c.doDamage(poison);
	}
}	
[/code]

Code doesn&#39;t make sense, I know.

So, for those who want the explanation. Well, think of this poison attribute as like regular poison. However, this poison hurts 3 times faster than the fastest weapon in rs. So the opponent gets hurt 3 times before you hit. There is critical poison damage and poison damage. Poison damage a random number from 1 - 4. The critical poison damage is a random number from 4 - 10.

[hr]

[center][u][b]Paralyze Attribute[/b][/u][/center]

The player will also sometimes become paralyzed. So, in the method that appends the players attack, there will be a call to the Paralyze class to see if the player is paralyzed, and if they are, can they attack this turn or not. During the attack, there is also a check to make them paralyzed.

[code=java]
// Code in combat thing
Paralyze.isParalyzed();
[/code]
[code=java]
// Code in during combat thing
Paralyze.doParalyzed();
[/code]
[code=java]
package server.content.attribution;

public class Paralyze {

	Client c;

	public Paralyze(Client c) {
		this.c = c;
	}

	public int paralyzed = 1;

	public boolean isParalyzed() {
		int could = Misc.random(3);
		if (c.paralyzeStatus == 1 &amp;&amp; could == paralyzed) {
			appendParalyze();
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}

	private void appendParalyze() {
		c.stopMovement();
		// Do gfx for paralyzation
		c.sendMessage(&quot;You are paralyzed and cannot attack due to that!&quot;);
	}

	public boolean doParalyzed() {
		int could = Misc.random(3);
		if (could = paralyzed) {
			makeParalyzed();
			return true;
		}
		if (paralyzedStatus == 1)
			return false;
		return false;
	}

	private void makeParalyzed() {
		c.paralyzedStatus == 1;
		c.sendMessage(&quot;You have been paralyzed! You might not be able to attack!&quot;);
	}

}[/code]

Paralyze gfx is the korasi special gfx.

[hr]

[center][u][b]Stun Attribute[/b][/u][/center]

The player will be stunned sometimes. Think of stunning a miniature paralyzation. However, stun has a 100% status to affect if you become stunned. Stun happens only for one turn.

[code=java]
// Code in combat thing
Stun.isStunned();
[/code]
[code=java]
// Code in during combat thing
Stun.doStun();
[/code]
[code=java]
package server.content.attribution;

public class Stun {

	Client c;

	public Stun(Client c) {
		this.c = c;
	}

	private int stun = 1;

	public boolean isStunned() {
		if (c.stunStatus == 1) {
			appendStunStatus();
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}

	private void appendStunStatus() {
		c.stopMovement();
		// Do gfx for stun
		c.sendMessage(&quot;You are stunned are unable to move this turn!&quot;);
		clear();
	}

	private void clear() {
		c.stunStatus = 0;
		c.sendMessage(&quot;You cure from your stunned status.&quot;);
	}

	public boolean doStun() {
		int could = Misc.random(3);
		if (could == stun) {
			makeStunned();
			return true;
		}
		if (c.stunStatus == 1 &amp;&amp; could == stun)
			return false;
		return false;
	}

	private void makeStunned() {
		c.stunStatus = 1;
		c.sendMessage(&quot;You have been stunned and will be unable to make a move next turn.&quot;);
	}
}
[/code]

Post any other attributes I could add and thoughts.</description>

That’s a little too extreme.</p>

              <p>yes, it’s obviously a unique idea, i like it. however, i don’t like the way you’ve done the concept (via code, obviously). has lots of deep holes that needs fixing. i’d happily help if you grant assistant.</p>
<p>anyway, for another ‘Weapon Attribute’, you could have a <span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">Level Attribute</span></span>.<br>
idea:<br>
deal damage to opposite player, drain some of the player(s) skill(s): hitpoints, strength whatever, then add it to yours (like leech). but not only that, make it decrease some of your levels as well, so not only does it work in your favour but also slightly the opposing player(s) favour as well.</p>
