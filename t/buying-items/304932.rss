    <title>Buying Items</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/buying-items/304932</link>
    <description>How do you change how many items you get while buying things from shops? Also with withdrawing.
Example: You click &quot;Buy 10&quot; but it actually buys 50.
Example: You click &quot;Withdraw 5&quot; but it actually withdraws 25.
Withdraw 1 actually works. 
Thanks!</description>
