    <title>Programming: How You Became What You Are Today</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/programming-how-you-became-what-you-are-today/404721</link>
    <description>Hi everyone. A simple discussion really. I&#39;m just about to start an Open University course, &quot;Object-oriented programming with Java (Level 2)&quot; in October. 

I believe this will give me the fundamental foundations needed to really excel in programming, as it&#39;ll be my first official qualification. 

I&#39;ve messed about with private servers for about 4 years now, so I know some basics, but only what&#39;s associated with RuneScape private servers. I find it harder to put Java in to pratice outside of the RSPS environment because it&#39;s what I&#39;m used to.

So, have you taken any college or university courses in programming? Are you self-taught? How did you find it learning and when did you really begin to accelerate in programming?

Thanks for reading.</description>

Self-taught, started off with GW-BASIC and Commodore-BASIC, then onto VB6, then i had C lessons (when i was 12), learnt Java from RSPS, started off just like all of you, copypasting tuts and shit, then i started reading better code to learn (ShardRevo) and i have a natural talent for recognizing patterns so thats why i understand the client so good, and ill get programming and CS at school next year (thats in 1.5month) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

<p>I read that book in my signature, and I loved it so much I typed it out for everyone to read. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Seriously though, I’ve been here for a year and a half approx. and I didn’t know anything about Java until about 2 months ago. I’ve just been lurking in the models section.</p>
