    <title>Well god armors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/well-god-armors/171920</link>
    <description>wow i have had to use this section a lot more then i expected but eh what can i say i=noob and its my first time working on a p server

anyways i was wondering why are the god armors i make not going into the right item slots as in they all go into the wep slot for some reason

now im going to go ahead and let you know dont bother telling me that i need to put the item ID into the right place in my item.java i already did that they keep going into the wep slot

i am using the project czar source if that makes any difference as it seems the maker changed a lot of item codes but i have made sure which item codes spawn which pieces of armor so i do know that i put them all in the right places is there anything more i can do

any help would be greatly appreciated thank you</description>

              <p>if you mean in game yes i have</p>
<p>however if you mean in item.java or another file im afraid i cant find where any of the weapons are i cant even find the whip in my item.java and i use it all the time it just leads me to assume that anything not in item.java just goes straight to the wep slot but i dont know</p>
<p>but if that was the case should my god armor not move after i put it in the right place in item.java?</p>
