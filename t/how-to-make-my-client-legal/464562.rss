              <p>You said you were adding the 639 models. Those Jagex still owns. They can still get you on copyright for re-creating their game if you re-do all the models, and re-write all the code.</p>

              <p>Considering that Jagex owns all the models/code from the client. Making it legal is impossible. They own all the rights to it.</p>
