        <p>I will say building the engine would be beyond actually picking what language you’d like to use, even if it’s Java.  just make sure you understand your problem correctly, and the language you choose for your engine won’t even matter.</p>

        <p>To be honest, the ‘engine’ as you’ve described it is ultimately a mapping of actions to outcomes. That is, you might map an action (i.e., prospecting a rock, or more generally object option 2) to a script, and that script runs subject to some predicate being true.</p>
<p>For example: You map the using a bank booth to a handling method that sends a message to the user. The predicate might only return true if the user is within a certain location (i.e., within a bank that, in your server, is abandoned). So whenever a player clicks a bank booth object while standing in an abandoned bank, they get the message (which might be something like “This bank is not operating.”).<br>
To complicate it a little further, you might want to chain handlers so that one action maps to zero to many handlers. You might also want to introduce the notion of priority, and finally the notion of either firing the action down the chain or aborting the action partway through the chain when appropriate.</p>
<p>For example, you might have the following actions for mining iron ore:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Priority 1</span>: Mining iron ore in a particular location during a quest - when this handler’s predicate is true, the handler fires and the quest progress is updated. This is a special case, so it doesn’t fire the event further down the chain.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Priority 2</span>: Regular iron ore mining. This is the default, and should always run if reached. You would likely place the regular action as the lowest priority so that special priority handlers have the chance to run when appropriate.</p>
<p>Importantly, a real game would have hundreds or thousands of handlers. So you need to use efficient data structures (typically structures that run in logarithmic time in the worst case – basically your tree structures). Otherwise the solution doesn’t scale up to those hundreds/thousands of handlers very well.</p>
<p>11pm brain dump. Don’t judge me too harshly.</p>

<p>I see, well thanks for the explanation but I’m trying to get something simple working right now and just handle a couple of things through scripts.</p>
<blockquote>For example: You map the using a bank booth to a handling method that sends a message to the user. The predicate might only return true if the user is within a certain location (i.e., within a bank that, in your server, is abandoned).

<p>These handlers, are they to execute the right script for the action?</p>
<p>Like if it was object clicking, it would be executing the script objectClick.py or have I got the wrong idea. Kinda confused on some of the terms used.</p>

        <p>It’s not as bad as you might think, but it isn’t quick either. I haven’t done it personally but Kane handles game development for our RSPS and showed me articles that he followed that literally list all the protocol you’ll need for the entire server engine. I’m sure it’d be tedious, but worth it. Being able to fully understand the entirety of your server structure would be really nice, especially considering a lot of these clients and server sources that people just edit pieces of code from we’re written in like 2001, and are just disgusting looking. You’ve probably seen the bukkshit where they have methods called “method557” or classes called “Class5_Sub1_Sub3_Sub1_Sub2” or something like that. So to avoid that whole mess by creating your own system is definitely worth it.</p>
<p>Plus, if Kane can figure it out a lot of people can, lolz.</p>
<p>Edit: But yeah I know nothing about Ruby or Python, just Java. So I have no idea how powerful those languages are in comparison to Java, or if it’s the right way about programming an RSPS. I feel as if it’d be the same concept except I don’t even know if Ruby/Python are object-oriented languages lol, could make a big difference. Unless you’re just up for a challenge though, what’s the point really? The community behind Java is just insanely huge so help is readily available, and everyone’s pretty much guaranteed to have it installed.</p>
<p>Anyways, good luck if you give a try, you should cause there’s no harm in that.</p>

It’s not as bad as you might think, but it isn’t quick either. I haven’t done it personally but Kane handles game development for our RSPS and showed me articles that he followed that literally list all the protocol you’ll need for the entire server engine. I’m sure it’d be tedious, but worth it. Being able to fully understand the entirety of your server structure would be really nice, especially considering a lot of these clients and server sources that people just edit pieces of code from we’re written in like 2001, and are just disgusting looking. You’ve probably seen the bukkshit where they have methods called “method557” or classes called “Class5_Sub1_Sub3_Sub1_Sub2” or something like that. So to avoid that whole mess by creating your own system is definitely worth it.</p>
<p>Plus, if Kane can figure it out a lot of people can, lolz.</p>
<p>Edit: But yeah I know nothing about Ruby or Python, just Java. So I have no idea how powerful those languages are in comparison to Java, or if it’s the right way about programming an RSPS. I feel as if it’d be the same concept except I don’t even know if Ruby/Python are object-oriented languages lol, could make a big difference.

Yeah I guess that makes sense. It’s kind of a little late for me to change clients though. And I got 2001 from the comments at the beginning of the class files.</p>

<p>That’s what I’m going for essentially, like a plugin system but I thought using another language will give me experience in something other than Java but just trying to set it up to work with game content at the moment.</p>
