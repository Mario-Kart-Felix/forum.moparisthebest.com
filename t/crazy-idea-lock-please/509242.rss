    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crazy-idea-lock-please/509242</link>
    <description>I just had this crazy idea, what if [b]Moparscape[/b] had it&#39;s own RSPS? That would be awesome..
And we use the Mopar client to play. I know it sounds crazy, but imagine that  :eek:

and I’m not being mean to them, but it’s going to require a lot more people to get anything done, especially if they aren’t doing it for their own benefit. If they were they might dedicate more time to it but nah</p>

Been thought of by many before you. Never gets started, always to disorganized. You can’t create such a server without some degree of corruption running about, as it would be so large scale.

It averages around 2000$ per month by the looks of things on the bidding page in recent months. Then he has Adsense on top of that from 5 sites. Money isn’t the object here though, money has never been a part of moparscape before and this aspect wouldn’t and shouldn’t matter either.</p>

<p>3 people is not near enough. Ruby wont be needed because you’re on an existing website right now. And I’m sure those other two aren’t capable of creating <span class="bbcode-b">from scratch</span>, a working and stable server. I also doubt you’ll find anyone who has the experience and is willing to help out.</p>

              <p>It has been mentioned many times, and it has been considered in previous times. There just aren’t too many reasons for having an official one, mostly due to many private servers dying or being shut down. Even if an official server was to come along, what revision would it be based upon? I’m sure it would take much longer than a few days, maybe even months.</p>

<p>Exactly this, its requires a good, dedicated team to even make something great. My chatroom is at a deadhault until I can get some people to help me with my tasks, as its getting to be to much to handle. The problem is there are a select few that I would even allow to touch my chatroom because not many people even know how to build efficient code, rather than just build something that ‘works’ but is a hog on the cycles.</p>
<p>I’ve seen it before when I was on a RSPS dev team. I had to re-write the entire smithing and minning class someone made because it was so inificient that it actually slowed the server about 30%. There are just not enough people with enough time and skills to do something like this. Especially with no financial gain. Its hard to keep doing something that you get nothing for, as real life and bills can easily get in the way.</p>
