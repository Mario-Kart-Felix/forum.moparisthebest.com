    <title>Slayer Tasks stuck at 0</title>

    <description>Greetings.

Some of my players are experiencing issues with the slayer system. It seems (on certain tasks) when they complete them and try to get a new one, Kuradal says &quot;You must complete your current slayer task to request a new one&quot; and when they check how many are left to kill, it says &quot;0&quot;. This seems to be an annoying glitch players are experiencing (it happens randomly) and I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to fix it.

Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>We have dealt with this before and to no avail I believe? Add a check to see if the task is 0 at the start of the dialogue block, if so trigger the method to give the player a new one.</p>
