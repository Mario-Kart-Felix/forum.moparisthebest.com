    <title>NPC hits zero when they shouldn&#39;t?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-hits-zero-when-they-shouldnt/309421</link>
    <description>I was just testing some NPC&#39;s that I added to make sure that X and Y cords are right, and drops, etc. But I ran into this odd (*might be*) glitch. All NPC&#39;s hit zero&#39;s . (so far I only have found that Tztok-Jad hits anything). I have 99 in every skill, with no armor and a whip, and I fought the Chaos ele, Daggonth kings, etc without being hit a single time. I created a lvl3 noob and fought a lvl 21 guard and he kept on hitting zero.

Did I forget to add something? O_O I really would like to find out if this the result of something missing, or just plain weird luck...
