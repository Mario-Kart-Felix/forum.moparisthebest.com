              <p>K, so here’s my story.</p>
<p>I was in Varrock when this noob comes up and tells me he’s willing to share his main with me (lvl92 acording to him) I was (70 bank then). So I add him. He tells me he needs my user and pass so if I jack his acount he’ll have something to back him up. I give him my lvl7 acount, thinking, why not make the noob happy?. When the noob logs on he says:“Thx for the acount man!” and starts laughing at me. The acount had NOTHING and was 9 days old with a bank PIN…imagine his face when he finally got rid of the PIN…I just can’t help laughing at all theese pittyful attempts of noobs to scam ppl of their acounts…it’s so…HAPPY!(sry, I just can’t stop laughing at the noob)</p>
<p>I HATE scamers thogh. Why? My main-hacked 5 times and scamed of full guthix at lvl63(Pay attention to the second trade screen ppl!!!)</p>
