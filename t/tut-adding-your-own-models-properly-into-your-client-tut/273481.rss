    <description>Sorry if I have already posted this but my internet was stuffing up before:

Lately,
I&#39;ve been hearing people say
Stuff like this,
[quote=&quot;senorlemon, post:5, topic:270651&quot;]yes i finally got it to work and i have it so all of the ints are right EXCEPT my guy uses it as a sword. how do i fix that?[/quote]
[quote=&quot;586, post:1, topic:266954&quot;]Nice how do i add it ?:S[/quote]
Or Things Like How do I add it into my client? or There&#39;s no INT&#39;s!
So I am making this tutorial to show you how to add them into your client,
then into your server.
1. Getting your models from right here!
Find a name you like,
Make sure it&#39;s beeing realsed and then download it, Most of them will have Ints, FOr those who don&#39;t
Here&#39;s an INT Code for the class8.java file, Credits to Silent CJ,
[code]
if(i == #####) // Your desired item id (the one you use after ::pickup ##### #)
{
class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;; // String name, this can be changed to wield, or attach, or whatever you want
class8.anInt174 = #####; // Drop/Inv Model
class8.anInt165 = #####; // Male Wield Model
class8.anInt200 = #####; // Female Wield
class8.anInt188 = #####; // Male arms/sleeves (Leave as -1 if not used)
class8.anInt164 = #####; // Female arms/sleeves (Leave as -1 if not used)
class8.anInt181 = 800; // Zoom - Increase to make inv model smaller
class8.anInt190 = 498; // Rotate up/down -  Increase to rotate upwards
class8.anInt198 = 1300; // Rotate right/left - Increase to rotate right
class8.anInt169 = -1; // Position in inv, increase to move right
class8.anInt194 = -1; // Position in inv, increase to move up						
class8.aString170 = &quot;@@@@@@@@@@@&quot;; // Item Name
class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;@@@@@@@@@@&quot;.getBytes(); // Item Examine
}
[/code]
GOt it? Kool.
So for this one I&#39;m going to be showing you a model without the Int&#39;s
I&#39;ll take a Model called &quot;Dragon Platebody&quot; By GalkonsPride,

First for starters download it,
then after that extract it to your desktop,
then open up your client folder,
Which should have a folder named &quot;Models&quot;
Open up that folder,
And put the G-Zipped Model into that FOlder, remember G-Zipp IS LIKE WIN RAR DO NOT EXTRACT IT!!!
After that You&#39;ll say AWW! No INTS!
How do I get that IN!!!!!, I REALLY LIKED THAT MODEL BUT NO INTS!!!
That&#39;s when Silent CJ&#39;s Ints come in handy, So your model is inside the Model&#39;s Folder,
The Model ID Was &quot;14105&quot; Right?
So that&#39;s where you put the models part in the ints!
Open up your Class8.java file and scroll down and you&#39;ll see some codes like this
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/2rmb39j.jpg[/img]
Under that add this...
[IMG]http://i42.tinypic.com/311q2s7.jpg[/img]
I changed mine to this,
[IMG]http://i39.tinypic.com/xcr690.jpg[/img]
Kool huh?
So Thats the Client Part!!!! All DOne in the Client!
2. The Server,
So I added the item into my client and i&#39;m wearing it in my server, but why is it a weapon?
It&#39;s a weapon because that is the default place for a new model...
to change it go into your item.java ( for devolution only item.java ) for allstar bases both item.java and item4.java  [NOTE] For Weapons there is no proper place don&#39;t worry about the item.java part [/NOTE]
then it&#39;ll come up with stuff like this?
( For both Item.java and item4.java )
[NOTE] Look what to do in the picture below [/NOTE]
[IMG]http://i41.tinypic.com/xbl9wo.jpg[/img]

Offtopic Tut: [Optional]
Adding the model with bonuses,
First for devolution users go into a file named &quot;Config&quot; and then open &quot;item.cfg&quot;
or allstar users you&#39;ll find a file called &quot;item.cfg&quot; randomly anywhere, Lol.
anyway open it up and look for a method to copy, For this type of item I would do
&quot;Crtl+F&quot; and Search for &quot;Platebody&quot; and copy a method to use and simply edit it so, I decided to use the &quot;Rune Platebody&quot; Method, which is
this,
[code]item = 1127	Rune_platebody	It&#39;s_a_Rune_platebody	40777.6030268936	40777.6030268936	53022.3636702846	0	0	0	-30	-10	82	80	72	-6	80	0	0[/code]
Just change the item ID, the Name Rune Platebody and the Examination and then copy your new method and make sure you didn&#39;t delete the Rune Platebody Method and go down to the bottom of your page and Paste it. (CRTL+V)
Alright, that&#39;s all,
Thanks for reading, took me an hour approximately to write this all up.
Please Comment on this TUT As it is one of the only ones I actually spent time on. &lt;&lt; Lol.
Well Actually it is pretty much my first Tutorial.</description>
