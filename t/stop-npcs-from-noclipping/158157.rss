    <title>Stop npcs from noclipping?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-npcs-from-noclipping/158157</link>
    <description>as many of you guys know... npcs are always in &quot;noclip&quot; mode.... meaning, you attack them from afar, and they walk through every building and object in their path to get to you.... also if you teleport or something while they are following you, they will just walk over the ocean and again, every building and object in their path until they reach you. i was wondering if there was a way to stop this, it would probably be in the boolean attackplayer, but im not even sure how you would do something like this because from what i believe, the concept of not being able to walk through walls is client side? and since npcs don&#39;t use a client (durr) i don&#39;t really see how this is possible.

if you have an idea... please post :)</description>
