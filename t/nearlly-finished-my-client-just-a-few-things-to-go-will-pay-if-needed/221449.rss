    <title>Nearlly finished My client just a few things to go (will pay if needed)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/nearlly-finished-my-client-just-a-few-things-to-go-will-pay-if-needed/221449</link>
    <description>Right, I am using devine pk source 5.0v, i have done my router and i have done my no-ip forum, done everything basicly to make it work and stuff, but i just want to change the name of the client to my name of choice and add a few things to the client, ive added loads of items and objects but there are different things i will need help with, not really alot to be fair,

Another thing is i send my client to them, but they hav to change the &#39;setting.ini&#39; to my ip all the time for them to log on,
i am willing to pay through paypal if alot of work is needed, think i need a src in the client folder to edit the name of the client and the picture when going to log in.


my msn adress is : tha_bold_one@hotmail.co.uk feel free to add me if you know what i am going on about and are willing to help :D


thanks alot
