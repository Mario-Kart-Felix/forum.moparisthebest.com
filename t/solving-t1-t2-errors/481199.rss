    <title>Solving T1, T2 Errors?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solving-t1-t2-errors/481199</link>
    <description>Normally, when I get a T1 or a T2 error. I google it, and well, of course I get some random irrelevent results due to all the numbers in the search query.
How do I go about solving them? Does anyone have a method for it?
Or should I just post them and hope for someone to know the issue ;)</description>

That’d be extremely helpful. I haven’t seen a performance downfall because of them, but I’d rather not take the chance <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

That’s good information to know, but how do I track it?<br>
Oh, what about T1’s?</p>
<p>-Sorry for late reply, it never showed someone replied to the topic.</p>
