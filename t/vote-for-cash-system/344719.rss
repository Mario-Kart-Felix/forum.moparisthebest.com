    <description>I was wondering if someone could either give me a code and tell me in &quot;very simple&quot; langauage how to do it because i am only a begginer.

I want people to be able to VOTE for battlescape2000 with this URL http://www.mmorpgtoplist.com/in.php?site=30297

so i want users to be able to click that URL, and somehow whenever they click it, they recieve 10k.

Is that possible?

NB - Im looking for a 24/7 hoster.. so please reply bellow as well.</description>

              <p>If you want it so that it’s automatically given to them if they click it, your going to have to set up MYSQL databases and intergrating it into your site. That will take a lot of work so no one is probably just going to give that to you. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>Now if you want it to where it gives them a command to enter in-game or it puts there name in a chatlog, then you can do that in as simple of a language as html… The only problem with that is if someone gives the command out.</p>
