    <title>Probably an easy question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/probably-an-easy-question/224923</link>
    <description>I know aboslutely nothing about java, but i wanna try to learn.

So i downloaded RSCD source, and i wanna try to code and make some of my own stuff

I open it up, and realize idk how to even start..

So my question is, what program do i use, or how do i actually start editing the source and adding my own things?

Thanks  :)[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 10, 2008, 10:56:27 pm[/size][hr]Sorry for double post, but i figured out how to edit it.  You just change the text in RSCD notepad file.

But the problem is, when i press compile or click on the executable java file it doesn&#39;t work.

Anyone know anything about this?</description>
