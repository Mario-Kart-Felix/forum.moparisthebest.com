Hi Moparscape, I am starting a new project called Mobascape. It is a Moba game based off of...yea you guess it....RUNESCAPE!

I have a long ways to go but I will be doing weekly and hopefully daily updates on this thread, so make sure to check back often to see what improvements and updates are added.
If you are liking the idea please feel free to message me if you would want to be a beta tester. Trying to get names before hand because we all know we cannot play a moba very efficiently with only 3 players online.

-The game playing experience will be different from most other MOBAS (Lol,Dota,Smite). The goal is to try to get as much Runescape feeling out of it as we can while still keeping this MOBA themed so here are some similarities and differences; 

-You will choose a character (some of the most famous npc&#39;s in Runescape. For example: Wise old man, KBD, Corp beast,Monk e.t.c)  

-You will sub master 2 non combat skills (each skill will give help to your team in some sort of advantage)
Example: Agility would be great for junglers so you can take shortcuts through the jungles to hop into lanes quicker

-Leveling will be very fast. In 15-20 minutes it will be common to get stats in the 80&#39;s-90&#39;s

-Higher the level you are the more advanced items you can purchase (Dclaws, whip, AGS, Armors)

-And at the end of each game if you win or lose you get credits. You can purchase more characters and skins with your credits.
