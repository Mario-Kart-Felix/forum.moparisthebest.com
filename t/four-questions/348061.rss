    <description>I have four questions.

1. How much is the chance Jagex will find my server out of the others?
2. If Jagex finds my server, will they immediately fine me or will they tell me to close the server?
3. How will they contact me?
4. Is it true that 317 aren&#39;t copyrighted anymore, so i just can use it freely without any problems?</description>

              <p><span class="hashtag">#1</span>. Dont worry about jagex. If you have a small server 0 - 100 players thats nothing, even if they found out its 5% they would do somthing about it. 2speced has 1k players and its not shut down yet.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#2</span>. They wont do neither, unless your server is very populated like dodian used to be. Dodian got warnings from jagex, after the 3rd warning they shut the server down. Im perty sure jagex doesnt even fine you. Only reason i could think of would be if your making $$ off the server.</p>
<p><span class="hashtag">#3</span>. I dont know im trying to find that out myself. Lawsuits are because of the copyrighted runescape source code, Jagex still owns that code so idk.</p>
<p>OVERALL YOUR SAFE <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>I wouldn’t worry all that much. I’m relatively sure that Jagex would be looking at private servers, not for the purpose of “busting” people, but to get ideas. That’s what I’d be doing if I released an MMORPG; just like what Bethesda has done with Oblivion and Fallout 3, the modding communities have made the PC versions great games.</p>

              <p>Oh, wait. They have to agree to the terms of service if they come on moparscape right? And one of them says u can’t be a Jagex employee or something of Jagex. So if they come to the server status of moparscape and if they see my server, they are breaking the law themselves, so im not guilty? But i still ask my self out how they will contact me…</p>
