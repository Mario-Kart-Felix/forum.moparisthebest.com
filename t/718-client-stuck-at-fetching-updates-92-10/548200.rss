    <description>hey everyone, 

ive been messing around with foxtrot 718 source and ive been customizing it, and coding it for a few months now. i did something and now the client gets stuck at 92%. i do not receive any errors or crash messages. and have left opened over night to see it it would load.
does it have to do with the cache? any help would be appreciative</description>
