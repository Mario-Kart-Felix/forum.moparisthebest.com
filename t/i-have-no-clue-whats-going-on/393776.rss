    <description>Okay i will admit I am an idiot when it comes to computers.
All I&#39;m here to do is play some fun hacked rs and everytime I try to run a server that has an online time of &quot;100%&quot; it always gives me errors like exceptions, &quot;Error connecting to server&quot;, &quot;loginserver is down, please try again in 1 minuete&quot;,ect.
Can anyone here tell me what i have to do?
I downloaded moparscape 3.2 w/ Aryan already.</description>

              <p>the moparscape cannot support newer servers, go to the serverstatus page and click a server either use a webclient if it has one, or download the desktop client. For the desktop client you would have to use winrar to extract it. Just google winrar and dl it its a free safe software</p>
