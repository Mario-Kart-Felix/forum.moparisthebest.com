    <description>[center][b]Zezi&#39;s thread to getting what you need to start a server and making a server[/b][/center]

[b] Rule&#39;s of this topic:
-No flamming
-No spamming
-Ask any questions you want![/b]

  [b]Section 1: Getting What You Need[/b]

 [b]Chapter 1: Getting Java[/b]

 Firstly go to http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp and scroll down the page until you see this
[IMG]http://i19.tinypic.com/65zthdl.jpg[/img]
Click &quot;Download&quot; and Security Information pop up should pop up providing options. Click &quot;Yes&quot; and continue. You should see a page that looks like this.
[IMG]http://i13.tinypic.com/4os9y77.jpg[/img]
Accept the license agreement that it at the top of the page and click &quot;Yes&quot; again to the pop up that comes. Click &quot;Windows Offline Installation, Multi-Language&quot; as shown below.
[IMG]http://i18.tinypic.com/66u8nq8.jpg[/img]
Click &quot;Save&quot; to the pop up that comes and save it to where ever you want it to be saved. Then it will start downloading.
[IMG]http://i8.tinypic.com/61npcux.jpg[/img]
After it is finished download, go to where ever you saved java 6u1 (May look like this &quot;jdk-6u1-windows-i586-p.exe&quot;) and double click it and follow the steps. Now you have java 6u1.

  [b]Chapter 2: Getting WinRAR[/b]

 First off go to http://www.rarlab.com/ and you should see a page full of information etc. Go to the very bottom and you should see a list of languages. Select any language you want and click &quot;Save&quot; save it to your desktop and wait for the computer to download winRAR. After it is finished downloading, go to your desktop and double click winRAR and install it. Now you have winRAR!

  [b]Section 2: Making A Server[/b]

 [b]Chapter 1: Getting Your Source[/b]

 If you want to make an entire server from scratch stop reading. If you want to get a source follow this link
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,122377.0.html
A source is a pre-made server that you can get and edit. First make a new folder on your desktop and name it what ever you want then select a source by following the link provided at the beggning of this chapter and save it to the folder you just made. After it is finished downloading, go to the folder you just made and right click the source you downloaded and click &quot;Extract to...&quot; and extract it to your desktop.

 [b]Chapter 2: Getting A No-Ip[/b]

 If you want to make a no-ip server keep reading. I suggest you do make one if you want more people online. First go to www.no-ip.com and sign-up.
[IMG]http://i13.tinypic.com/4mcegqh.jpg[/img]
Once you have finsihed making an account, logg in.
[IMG]http://i8.tinypic.com/6akozeu.jpg[/img]
Now on the left side you should see a list of options. Under Hosts/Redirects click &quot;Add&quot;
[IMG]http://i15.tinypic.com/5zbywzc.jpg[/img]
It should take you to a page. Under &quot;Hostname Information&quot; you should see &quot;Hostname&quot; type the hostname you want and in the scroll box click rest of the subdomain. Then scroll down and click &quot;Create Host&quot;. Now go to www.portforward.com and in the second paragraph you should see a option in orange saying &quot;Routers&quot; click it. Now wait for the page to load for a little. May take 5-10 seconds.
[IMG]http://i11.tinypic.com/543orqu.jpg[/img]
Now select the router your are using. After you are done selecting the router you are using, you should see a page with a list of games. Select &quot;1st SMTP Server&quot;
[IMG]http://i9.tinypic.com/5z27kw6.jpg[/img]
And follow the steps. Now you have a no-ip!

 Chapter 3: Compiling and Running Your Server

 Now go to your folder with your source that is on your desktop and you should see .java files and .class files. Find client.java and open it with notepad. This your main folder for editing stuff e.g. Changing max level. Don&#39;t mess with the other folders untill you know more about java. There it tuts on the tut section of the fourms and tells you how. But you still need a lil bit of knowledge. Now go into your client.java and use ctrl + f and in the little box that shows up, type the name of the server you downloaded and click find. Now it will have the name of your server highlighted. Change it to whate ever you want. E.g. servernamescape. But only change what&#39;s in the quotes! Or when you compile, it won&#39;t work.
[IMG]http://i15.tinypic.com/4paff6b.jpg[/img]
After you edit each and final one in the quotes, go to &quot;File&quot; and &quot;Save&quot;.  Now go into your server folder and find &quot;Compile.bat&quot; this is what a no error compilier looks like.
[IMG]http://i8.tinypic.com/5z58ndk.jpg[/img]
If there&#39;s errors or it cannot find a specified path, use Mod Taharoks perfect compiler. Here&#39;s the link. http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,49747.0.html
If it says it cannot find java 5.0 or 6.0 re-download java. The steps to download is at beggning of this thread. If it compiled without errors, open up mooparscape, put in the port of your server and type in a username and password and for the IP type in &quot;local host&quot;. If it compiled with errors or specified path or cannot find java 5.0 or 6.0 do what i said then compile and open up moparscape and type in port of your server then put a username and password and for the IP type in &quot;localhost&quot;.
