    <description>Ok i tried to add my server to the server status page but it said my server was already posted...then i waited 10 minutes..then it said your server is offline...wtf? I portforwarded, added the port to the exeptions tab thingy, and have a no-ip. Also I typed in my ip in the  &quot;SERVER&quot; spot on silabs client and it logged me in my server does this mean it can let other people in? Someone post please :]</description>
