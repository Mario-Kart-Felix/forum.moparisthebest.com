<blockquote>I started playing Runescape in December of 2004, I started cheating on Runescape around January of 05 when i found a site with SCAR scripts on it from google, www.rstools.prv.pl, I downloaded chrizs ironminerbanker from there and I was off cheating. Reading that script is how I learned to write scripts. Then in April my mostly legit main got banned because I messed up one line on my second script ever, an autofletcher. I then took a break from runescape, only to come back a few months later in July to find my first cheating community, sythe.org, after posting there a while, I came across a link to kaitnieks.com. I knew the name kaitnieks as the creator of SCAR, so I figured I would check it out, all of the people there including kaitnieks himself were so nice and friendly I just stayed. Since then I have learned many many things, posted a few SCAR scripts people still use and spammed the forums quite well. When winterlove released his private server publicly I wrote a client for it as basically my first attempt at client modifing, well it stuck and everyone started using it. After that I worked on another project, MoparScape Revolution, a pking/SCARable client that was autoupdating and incorporated all of the features I liked to give us cheaters an unfair advantage against legit players in the game. Over the years I have written various small tools, games, and frameworks. One of the ones that I like the best, is a project called Cherokee, which can be found with the full source on sourceforge.net by checking it out with SVN. Though it is not a full fledged bot, it does not lack much from being one, and can be a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in runescape cheating. Since then most of my time has been taken up with college, and courting Ashton up to our recent marriage. I have had time to release a few more private server versions of MoparScape, and soon another will be forthcoming.</blockquote>
