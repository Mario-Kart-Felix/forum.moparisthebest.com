Go into your source folder and open character folder and find the character you want to make mod. Open the characters file and you should see <span class="bbcode-b">character-rights = 0</span> somewhere down. Change the “0” to (1 = player mod, 2 = admin, 3 = owner) whatever you want him to be. Save, close then open up your client.java file and search (CTRL + f) for <code>playerRights = 3</code>. Now you should see somewhere there <span class="bbcode-b">“admin”</span>. Change the admin to the name you made Mod in the characters folder. And if you scroll down there are more options for mods. Save + close client.java and compile, runserve and you should be mod.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Cheezscape</span><br>
Cheezscape is much easier just open the the characters folder and open the characters file you wish to make mod and change the <span class="bbcode-b">“0”</span> to whatever you wanna make him. (1 = Player mod, 2 = Admin, 3 = Owner).</p>
