    <description>Well the user selects the option from a combo box the thing is that i dont no how many items will be in the list as it reads all files from a directory and load them into a text field so my question is how can i select a item on the list and perform a action for that item for example open a file with that name.</description>

              <p>For the amount, use ComboBox.Items.Length (-1 for a certain index thing), and if I were you, I would make a custom control extending it to give it a filename property. Then again, if you’re just going to store as text, use the SelectedText property (Or is that the ListBox?) If so, just use ComboBox.Text.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to extend it, just make an array containing what you want (Again, if you don’t show the filename). This is twice the work though, as you’ll have to modify it as you modify the combobox’s items.</p>
<p>Oh, and as a final edit, check the SelectedIndexChanged event (Or something along those lines).</p>
