    <title>The IP changing mystery (MUST READ!)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-ip-changing-mystery-must-read/327024</link>
    <description>ok lol, so i posted on mopar like 6 months ago that i had a little problem. it was that almost every time i turned on my comp i had to reconfigure my fucking no-ip to a new ip address and this sometimes happened even when i was on my computer at the time because all of a sudden the server dced everyone and halted all connections &lt;.&lt;
so anyway, i posted that on here and people were saying things like don&#39;t worry it&#39;s only your dynamic ip address and it will occasionally change your ip.
however i did some research into it and i find:
1. my ip address was infact a static one
2. generally your computer must be inactive to close to Ethernet gateway so your dynamic ip settings can reconfigure themselves.

so of course i was like WTF!? and nobody could solve my problem.
but just recently it hit me, i have always used a program called [b]RSBOT[/b] which allows you to bot on runescape and i discovered that every time you start up rsbot, it changes your ip automatically (could be very handy) so after finding this out i knew straight away that is what the problem had been because i have used it for quite a while and was using it at the time that i originally had that problem.
so if you have ever had or are currently experiencing that problem then take note that it&#39;s probably rsbot that is doing this to you :P
thanks for reading,

</aside>
<p>because jagex logs you in with information of your ip address and if you have the same ip it says to many connections from this <span class="bbcode-b">address(!)</span> but whilst using rsbot if you log in an account and then open up another rsbot it will change your ip but the account you logged in beforehand will stay logged in on the previous ip address until you log out then you will have to restart another rsbot to be able to multilog again. get me? and yes gunz it contains the same signed properties of a runescape client however it has many gui’s and settings built in.</p>

it does infact change your ip address and also the fact you can multiple log on the same computer (same world) with rsbot… try that hmm? also look on <a href="http://rsbot.org" rel="nofollow noopener">rsbot.org</a></p>

<p>A question since i don’t use rsbot, i use rsbots. Is it a unsigned client? If so, thats why you may be able login same world, same computer.</p>
