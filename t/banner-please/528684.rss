If someone could make my Squad a banner I will highly appreciate it and give you full credits, as I believe in honesty. 

I would like the banner to have the same [b]Text, Text Fonts, Text Color[/b]. I would like the L to be bigger than ebrican, and little below and above it. For the background I want it transparent. I also want a little mascot. For the mascot I want it to be a red bird(preferably a cardinal).

Thanks in advanced.</description>
