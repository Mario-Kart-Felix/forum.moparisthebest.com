    <title>Requesting written guide or a movie on client programming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-written-guide-or-a-movie-on-client-programming/545593</link>
    <description>Hello!

I&#39;m not 100% sure if this is the right section for this topic,
however I need help with development of a Runescape 2 client.

I find the program code for a 317 client where names as &quot;anIntxx&quot;
or &quot;aBooleanxx&quot; are used, cryptic, obfuscated and hard to understand.
Therefor, I wonder if somebody knows a well-written guide or a
movie where the code for such a client is reviewed.
Alternatively, if you got other tips for me and can point me in the right direction?

I have searched for guides on how to read obfuscated Java code, how to program RSPS Clients
and ofcourse, general Java programming.

If I explained my problem in a confusing way, feel free to ask.

Have a nice day.  :cool:</description>
