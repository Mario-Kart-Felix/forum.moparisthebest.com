    <title>Need Source (Probably wrong section, no where else to put it)</title>

    <description>I know this is probably the wrong section to post this, but there is really no other place to put it.

I need a 317 source that doesn&#39;t have the teleports where the emotes should be. I want the emotes to be there, and working. I also want it to have all of the basic commands such as ::ban, ::unban, ::mute, ::unmute, ::ipmute, ::unipmute, ::ipban, ::unipban, ::jail, ::unjail, ::xteletome, ::xteleto, ::tele. I also need it to be a source that isn&#39;t PvP everywhere. If anyone could PM me the link to one I would appreciate it, and maybe Rep++.

Thanks, and sorry for placing in the wrong section.</description>
