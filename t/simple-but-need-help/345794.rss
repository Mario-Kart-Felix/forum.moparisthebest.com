              <p>ok, your englis ain’t dat gewd, so ill try  to understand what you said,</p>
<p>TO MOVE A SHOP I THINK YOUR TALKING ABOUT MOVING A NPC(NON PLAYER CHARACTER)<br>
FIRST YOU NEED TO FIND THE NPC’S ID, THEN YOU MUST OPEN UP AUTOSPAWN.CFG, CTRL-F AND FIND THAT NPC’S SPAWN THINGY, THEN JUST CHANGE THE COORDINATES.</p>
<p>as for your other one, haven’t got a clue</p>
