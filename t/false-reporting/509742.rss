    <description>Might sound pretty lame, but here it is:

So there&#39;s this some random idiot in my school who decided to make a Twitter and Facebook account just to harass people anonymously. I was able to get his IP just to track him down and know who he is. But, I couldn&#39;t find his name. Egypt is a pretty bad place that contains no e-Rules. If I was to false report this person for DDoSing me to his ISP, could I get into any consequences? 

Reply if you need more clarification. :)</description>
