    <description>Its been a while since I last scripted for SCAR and theres a few things I&#39;d like to know before I start scripting again.

#1) What is the most updated/most used include for SCAR at the moment? Which one handles random events the best?

#2) What are the new randoms? If i understand correctly Jagx has added a whole heap of new random events in the past few months.

#3)What other methods do Jagx use for detecting scripts now, and what are the ways of getting around them?

I&#39;m planning to start Scripting again next week :P</description>

<p>i use less space between report(move slower) and i curve it as if it was a human doing it plus i include random mouse movement during the boring part to make it look like a human is doing it all, also i do misclicks(dont click the right place) with corrections.</p>

<p>You may not be banned off the bat(seeing as Aryan too forces commands), but it makes it even MORE detectable.</p>

LMFAO, actually, do you know how aryan runs on a client?  We took Jagex’s source for the RS client, decompiles, deobfuscated, and renamed it so it is semi-legible.</p>
<p>In order to run a bot similar to aryan you will need to heavilly edit the client’s code.  Seeing as you can’t DO THIS TO EVERY CLIENT (meaning, you can’t just open up <a href="http://runescape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.com</a> and bot on it.).</p>

<em>Sighs</em>  Aryan is NOT a third party client.  You’re not allowed to edit the client in any way, which is against the law, by the way.  Also, SCAR has an assload of commands.  Just sees how much you know about anything.</p>

<p>Jagex CAN and WILL record every one of your mouse movements.  It’s not illegal, nothing.  It doesn’t have to be in thier tos, either.  It’s not hard to Jagex to see you forcing actions like hell (which aryan does).  Scar, on the other hand is also VERY detectable.  The mouse methods aren’t decent at all at the moment.</p>
<p>Also, SDcit, there has been some changes in Jagex’s detection methods.  Actually, they no longer use a togglable boolean.  They fixed that because <span class="bbcode-b">Aryan ruined all RS cheating. </span> Anyways, Aryan has also left MASSIVE amounts of traps in.  According to Pplsuqbawlz &lt;3, the only reasonable way to get passed the client’s hundreds of traps is to not edit the client at all.  And what does Aryan have to do, rename and edit most of the client.</p>
<p>Now, why don’t you go learn something and then come back and tell us Aryan is undetectable.</p>

              <p>i never said that ayran is undetectable but… ayran is a third party client(wich is allows) and bots wich run on aryan are not so who gives a fuck about aryan were talking bots, scar is detecable becasue of crappy coding and not enough commands, u can do so much better using bots(u can use java bots on any client) so im saying that java bots kicks scars ass… duh</p>
<p>and if i know nothing about java then how come im autoing with it???</p>
<p>yea i geuss that 110k rune ess in  2 weeks is done by a person, who they hell spends that much time playing rs?(jagex thinks people do though)</p>

<p>1)yes ive used it(aryan is much better(no friggin colors))<br>
2)if u log out on the first one every time u get it dont u think that noticable???<br>
3)thats why u have fake focus… so the mouse movement are recorded from each position to the next(with curves to make it human like) it all depends on who writes your script.<br>
4)not really, scar cant do the strange box, loggin out is very suspicous if u do it alot</p>
<p>also ive used ayran for a month, no ban!!!(i write my own scripts) and since my scripts record the mouse movement with curves and random movement(like a bored person) no one will even notice. and the toggleable bolean will just tell then the mouse movements so it isnt very effective if your script is recording the mouse movement like it should. now with most scripts it just clicks at the spot so they are detectable, mine moves a fake mouse to there and jagex has no way of noing its not real… there is only so much you can go using java, and if ur smart ur safe, same with scar(but u got colors and shit like that+random that fuck it up) so its not a very effective script… besides right now if writing scar scripts to see how undetecable it can get…</p>

<p>Do you understand that if Jagex installs the latest JDE (sp?), Java bots go down the drain.</p>
<p>Have you used SCAR? Please, we have things we like  to call AntiRandoms. They, for your info, SOLVE randoms. THe new box? How do we get 400 boxes if it logs out on the<br>
first one?</p>
<p>You do know that Runescape can record your mouse movements hm?</p>
<p>Lets make this clearer. RS has a something, i forgot what it was. But it is a toggable boolean. RS can simply switch this on and woops, they can see you. What is there next action?</p>
<p>Has an account that has been banned with Aryan ever been released? As far as i remember…1! only 1, was locked for a long time. hm…  Using Scar, i have only noticed 1-2 “Im banned threads” in a MONTH.</p>
<p>Im not saying SCAR is undetectable OK. Every bot you can imagine is detectable. Its just that Java Bots stand out like a sore thumb. DO NOT, i repeat. DO NOT, try and think you know what power Jagex has to detect you</p>

              <p>tell me something</p>
<p>how does  a java bot that clicks your mouse for u be detectable?</p>
<p>runescape cant scan ur pc or check where ur mouse is(not in there tos) so if u get banned when ur using aryan then u should sew their asses off… also they cant update their tos now because ur already playing and they dont have in their tos that they can update their tos at anytime so inevitably if they ban u then u get money…</p>
<p>also if i was a jagex member and someone had 400+ strange boxes and was just standing their trying to mine or something… i would hit BAN so fast…</p>
<p>so basically even if scar is less detecable it is better becasue it wont get fucked up by the randoms(wich gets u banned)</p>
<p>so all in all, if aryan is detectable(wich looking at the source i would say they only way is it rs was doing illegal operations and checking what keys u hit/where ur mouse is) tand scar is detecable, jagex wins.[br][size=1]Posted at: April 11, 2006, 12:15:55 pm[/size][hr][quote=“sdcit, post:12, topic:967”]Ahaha.</p>
<p>Take it this way, if Aryan is not very detectable, SCAR is a  real guy whos going to play the game for you.</p>
<p>I see ,irule, that you weren’t a com mem at kaitnieks?. someone, Sempaphore i think, (ya it was him) posted a giant thing about how ALL java bots could be detected insanley easily. This includes, angle, a boolean, etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>okay all java bots now have a nice script(ill post it) that makes it think u have ur mouse clicking(even though u dont)and also how long ago was kaitneiks up? besides his site was about scar wouldnt u think they would try and get u to use it not aryan? its all a battle for users here… but IF runescape was allowed to illegaly acces ur computer then scar would be better, but THEY CANT…</p>
