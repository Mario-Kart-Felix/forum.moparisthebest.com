<p>We almost done replicating the whole game. We have a solid team. Only problem in the RSC business is the funds as people ddos hard but so far so good with the funds. Your support is always welcome as this project will be the closest replica you will have played.</p>
<p>We are opening the servers very soon so stay tuned.</p>

<p>That’s only the dedicated server, for the ddos protection you must pay around 5-8 times that on top of it. And DDoS protection is a must have for popular servers, otherwise the script kiddies in this community will ddos u down.</p>

If you think is maxing in weeks are bad, come to 317+. They have like 800x exp rates where you can max the first day…</p>

We all know that you need quite a few bucks to keep a server running. I will bring an example from totally different field but in my opinion it makes sense.</p>
<p>I am sure that most of you are familiar with women having free entrance to the clubs. Seems like clubs need more women to the clubs.<br>
NO. These women are not the usual customers for clubs. They usually don’t buy drinks, instead they find someone to buy for them (ofc. there are exceptions). So what the clubs do is grant free entrance for women who attract people who bring money in.</p>
<p>1x exp server is for those who can spend all their time on gaming. Those who have jobs have basically no possibilities to compete with the others. However these people who can spend all day on gaming will probably play higher exp rate servers too.</p>
