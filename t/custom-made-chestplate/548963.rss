    <title>Custom Made Chestplate</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/custom-made-chestplate/548963</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i made a chestplate that i worked on when i felt like modelling, probably spent about 3+ hours all up, this was made from scratch no pre-drawn picture to trace or anything (besides using a male model for shape). it can still be coloured but idk what colours to use. anyway tell me what you think:
P.S fairly new to modelling, only modelled a few swords in the past

<p>Yea, the poly count isn’t too nice, about 1500, but if i were to ever put it in game for actual use, im sure i could clean it up to about 1000 (with a few detail sacrifices).

</aside>
<p>That is a harsh amount for sure, by the looks of it the clean up wouldn’t be too bad and you wouldn’t have to change the detail too much. I understand, i’m the same way but the end result is something to look forward to.</p>
<blockquote>i had one idea in mind for it being frost dragon armour</blockquote>
<p>That would be most suitable, i reckon give the palette a try because it’d probably suit it the best.</p>

<p>TBH just putting it in game alone will cause you to sacrifice some details. So you lowering the poly’s won’t be too bad, in terms of it rendering in game.</p>

thanks heaps, the feedback really motivates me. yea i’ve only moddelled a few swords and edited existing models (extending on them).<br>
i can show you some of them if you would like</p>

Add some color and that thing is ready to go.
You could make it a god colored body.
<p>Zammy colors always looked cool (black/red or) imo</p>
</blockquote><br>
i might consider doing that.<br>
actually early on, when i hadn’t finished making it, i made it a light icy blue. It looked quiet nice and because the thorns and everything i had one idea in mind for it being frost dragon armour
<blockquote>If you use meta change the obj smoothing to 120, it makes it look a little nicer. 
<p>The only issue i have is the poly, can you upload the wireframe? Try figure out a name for the item and then select the palette from there, it helps if you’ve a basis for the model. Have you also considered making a set for this? Furthering the idea could promising. Great work, keep it up.</p>
