    <description> :confused:[size=36pt]WEBCLIENT PROBLEM[/size] :confused:

[size=18pt]Problems:[/size]
-Webclient is on website, yet both the client on computer, and webclient won&#39;t work
-webclient says = &quot;Sorry, an error has occurred whilst loading Runescape:
                          -try reloading browser
                         - try using different java
                           - try a different world
                           - etc...

client on computer says : 
 connection error - retrying in [] seconds


and keeps going on from there.



[size=24pt]WHAT I DID DO:[/size]
-Put the cache with sprites, raw, and data folders and all the other files, (not the cache folder itself, but all the files in it) 
up for download at fileden.
-took the link from fileden and put it in cachedownloader.java
-put name of cache in class36.java
-put name of cache in modeldecompressor.java
-put name of cache in sprite.java
----pictures on bottom for those ------


I also looked up several tutorials and looked for help but couldn&#39;t find it!

I have tried several methods but none work!

also, i forgot to mention:
[size=36pt]I AM A NOVICE PROGRAMMER, IF ANYTHING, so please be detailed with your responses![/size]
