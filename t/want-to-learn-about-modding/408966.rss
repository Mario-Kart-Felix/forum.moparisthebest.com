    <title>Want to learn about modding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/want-to-learn-about-modding/408966</link>
    <description>Does anyone know where I can find some resources about modding? I want to make a few that make my job just a little bit easier (Kind of like Altoholic on WoW). Perhaps a map in the corner, etc. I can&#39;t seem to find any guides on the minecraft forums. So any resources you could post would be very hopeful.</description>

<p>The biggest rules you are going to need to know if you want to become a modder:<br>
[ul][li]Know how to recompile without needing anything but 1 java file[/li]<br>
[li]Know how to solve issues when you have conflicting voids because of an obfuscated class (or voids within class)[/li]<br>
[li]Be able to read and understand obfuscated code fairly well[/li]<br>
[li]Able to keep the code clean and neat, as this is running with the game.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>EDIT - This will help you when searching for a specific string or such. Its just the normal ‘z-filesearcher.jar’ with its case sensitive problem removed.<br>

<p>I know how to do all those things. I have a client updater (kind of like what RS Bots use), and was planning on using BCEL/ASM to hook events and such.</p>
<p>I was just under the impression that Notch had released an API for such things. Anyways, thanks for the help.</p>
