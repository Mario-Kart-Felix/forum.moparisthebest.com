              <p>Yeah, write some filler in your thread. Just click the modify button, and make it look better designed with more detail. But always keep your thread updated with posts like that, saying: “Hey, I’m going to be making this.” It notifies everyone that you’re currently working on something. You could also do it to where you have something on your thread in a certain color showing that it’s currently being worked on. Just make your thread look nice, and filled in, then people will start to take it more seriously. The more effort you put into your thread, the more people will start to support it, really. It shows dedication.</p>

              <p>Nobody ever thinks, “hey, who’s this new guy trying to make a project in a community that we support doing so?” You should provide more information about your server. Like your goals, update log, basic information about the server, just more stuff to fill up your thread. Your project would be taken more seriously this way, and you need a new layout. Not many pictures is fine, in the beginning, but you can’t forget to continuously update your pictures. Keep updated news and information in your replies, because not everyone re-reads the thread to check if you’ve made an update. Just some tips, constructive criticism - whatever.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@OP</span>:<br>
I like the titlebox, it could use some work - but overall, I like it. Hope to see this moving along. I’ve noticed that there’s been no replies to this, so I wanted to get it started.</p>
