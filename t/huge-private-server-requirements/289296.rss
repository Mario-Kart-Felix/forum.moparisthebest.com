    <title>Huge Private Server Requirements</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/huge-private-server-requirements/289296</link>
    <description>I want to have a private server that can hold 300+ users. I have a VPS host that offers for a price 1280 MB of RAM, 15 GB Disk Space, and 400 GB bandwith. This is for a 1 month plan which costs $44.00 USD per month. I am contacting them to find out if this is even possible to run on a VPS. For the main questions i have i am wondering if the batch file that recognizes connections is enough to process so many connections. Especially HD clients. What do you think? Are there any other server specs i should get that may be a major factor before hosting with this company?</description>

</aside>
<p>Thats not a contradiction… its a correction. I meant 200 hard drives, which is what I said during the CORRECTION. Contradictions are when you say something, then say something exactly the opposite. Such as: “This room has been painted completly blue. This room is orange.” or “Jagex has 200 computers to run servers. Jagex has 150 computers to run servers.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you think? Are there any other server specs i should get that may be a major factor before hosting with this company?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The bandwidth/disk space/RAM you have is suitable to handle 300 clients. You have more than enough disk space, and you likely won’t be getting anywhere near that amount of bandwidth usage in a month. More RAM would help, but since it’s a dedicated server and you won’t be running any of your own apps, it should be fine. The only thing you need to check out is how many connections you can have open.</p>
<p>Also, in regard to hosting from home vs. hosting on a dedicated server, hosting on a dedicated server is preferrable since internet failures / power outages happen much more often locally. You also get the ability to turn your computer off without disrupting your server, saving you a significant amount of money for power usage.</p>
