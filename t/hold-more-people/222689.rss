    <title>Hold More People?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hold-more-people/222689</link>
    <description>Well I have a server that a lot of people like... But i have one problem... When i get about 12 people on my server I get this Java Heap Space Message or something in the Compiler... And then no more people can join... So i restart the server only to get the people who werent able to get on before complaining about not being able to get on and stuff... How can i be able to get more people on my server instead of it only being 12? I also heard of something called like worlds or something? Can someone explain that to me aswell?

Please help me... I want to make my server really good and this is just holding me back... I have seen some servers that have like 30 to 40 people online... How is that?!?!??</description>

              <p>I wouldn’t do that with the worlds, because if the person got to the max lvl on say world 6000 then decided to go to 43594 its really a whole diff server so they lose their lvls… ain’t gonna work like that</p>

              <p>for worlds you need to make a few copies of ur server and go to server.java and search for 43594 “its the port” and change it to like 6000 then u have to add it like you had to add 43594 and boom there u have worlds</p>
