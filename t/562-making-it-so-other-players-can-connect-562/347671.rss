    <title>[562]Making it so other players can connect[562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-making-it-so-other-players-can-connect-562/347671</link>
    <description>Currently I am making a 562 server and have a router/box that Time Warner Cable has given me to get internet.  The problem is the tutorials on how to connect players to your server are mostly about Linksys Routers.  I have no clue if you can host players on a Router/Box that has came from Time Warner Cable.  Also, I have tried to connect players to my server but it never works.  So if you can answer this question please post it.  Thanks!</description>
