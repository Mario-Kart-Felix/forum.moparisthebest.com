    <title>What would you spend the $8,500 on?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-would-you-spend-the-8-500-on/528073</link>
    <description>Recently i won third prize in an art competition on ocean acidification, and won $8,500 for the school. Today, the principal approached me and said he wanted to talk to me about what school project i&#39;d like to spend the money on. Personally, i have no clue what i could possibly put this to except for art supplies or maybe new computers in the art room. Any thoughts on what i could suggest to him?</description>

As a person who studied educational administration. Let me explain something to you about “projects”</p>
<p>Just like in the government products cost more for the schools than it does for a regular person going to a store. You need to realize that something like furniture or a computer normally might cost us 100-200$ USD well in a school setting you can easily be looking at 450-500$ USD.</p>
<p>Have you considered making a “student fund” project. Where parents, students, and teachers alike can donate money to this fund. The fund would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take funds out for death in family (where like flowers or something would be bought in honor of that student/teachers death)</li>
<li>Take funds out for a minor percentage to go towards cost of student trophies(you would be surprised how much they cost the schooL!)</li>
<li>Like monthly drives could be ran to help try to increase the coffers of the fund.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will need a very responsible person to help set up and manage ( be the treasurer) of the funds so as to not go to low or too high.</p>
<p>I would also suggest talking with the principal about this in the depth as well cause there may or may not already be a similar system set forth. If there is you could always suggest to just donate to that project.<br>
[/quote]You’re such a retard. Just stop posting.</p>
<p>Put it towards extra-curricular activities or your gym.[/quote]how is a student fund “retarded” Most business have a similar system set up for employees I don’t see why it can’t be done in a school. As a matter of fact, I know it is done in some schools.</p>
<p>So by your logic you’re the retard have a good day. :palm:</p>
<p>Edit: and the next time you call somebody a retard justify your reasoning.</p>

<p>Things I can think of:</p>
<ul>
<li>host lessons to get your driver’s license at school (for those who have the approperiate age)</li>
<li>add extra lessons (probably temporary, considering the budget) such as maybe a 3D class or somthing</li>
<li>recreational purposes (playground extension, a green field, trees, a garden would be such an awesome thing to have in a school)</li>
<li>(already suggested this I’ll say it again) a student’s room</li>
<li>more lockers incase you don’t have enough (or don’t have any)</li>
<li>school trip for your class to a destination of choice</li>

              <p>We don’t have a photoshop class, we only have the basic subject like maths, art, english etc. The school is too poor to put it into a scholarship, also i don’t plan on doing further studies so it would be pointless. My principal usually doesn’t favour the older students, as i go to a p-12 college. Getting a them to dedicate the money to me would be extremely rare and improbable.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestions though, i’d suggest them if i went to a normal school.</p>

              <p>As a person who studied educational administration. Let me explain something to you about “projects”</p>
<p>Just like in the government products cost more for the schools than it does for a regular person going to a store. You need to realize that something like furniture or a computer normally might cost us 100-200$ USD well in a school setting you can easily be looking at 450-500$ USD.</p>
<p>Have you considered making a “student fund” project. Where parents, students, and teachers alike can donate money to this fund. The fund would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take funds out for death in family (where like flowers or something would be bought in honor of that student/teachers death)</li>
<li>Take funds out for a minor percentage to go towards cost of student trophies(you would be surprised how much they cost the schooL!)</li>
<li>Like monthly drives could be ran to help try to increase the coffers of the fund.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will need a very responsible person to help set up and manage ( be the treasurer) of the funds so as to not go to low or too high.</p>
<p>I would also suggest talking with the principal about this in the depth as well cause there may or may not already be a similar system set forth. If there is you could always suggest to just donate to that project.</p>

              <p>Recently i won third prize in an art competition on ocean acidification, and won $8,500 for the school. Today, the principal approached me and said he wanted to talk to me about what school project i’d like to spend the money on. Personally, i have no clue what i could possibly put this to except for art supplies or maybe new computers in the art room. Any thoughts on what i could suggest to him?</p>
