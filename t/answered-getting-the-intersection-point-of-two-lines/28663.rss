    <title>[ANSWERED] Getting the Intersection Point of Two Lines</title>

    <description>EDIT: masquerader helped me over at Villu.

Hey, I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out for a while, but I can&#39;t get it.

I have the starting coords of the first line, and the ending coords of the second line, the staring coords of the second line, and the ending coords of the second line. I need to find the point of intersection of the two lines.

Here&#39;s a little picture for a better explanation:

The red line is the first line, and the black line is the second line. I need to find the intersection coordinates, (5, 5) using a formula or something. In this situation, it wouldn&#39;t be hard considering the red line is (y = 5) and the black line is (x = 5) so you&#39;d just put the x and y together to get the intersection point of 5, 5. But, the lines I&#39;ll be dealing with are more like this:

I know there&#39;s some way to do it, I just can&#39;t get it. 

Thanks in advance,

<p>It calculates 2 lines and then tells you what point they intersect at and how they figured it out.<br>
