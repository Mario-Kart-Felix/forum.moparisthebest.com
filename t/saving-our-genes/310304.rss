    <title>Saving our genes?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/saving-our-genes/310304</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve come across this worrying feeling that many people believe they should somehow apply evolution to a human society.
For instance, dont warn people about the dangers of drugs because it will help remove their undesirable genes from the gene pool.


A society where darwinian principles were applied would be a very unpleasant society to live in.

Evolution tells us how we got here, it should not be a basis for our morals.

Evolution is a part of science, and science is a descriptive force, not a prescriptive one. Using evolution as an argument not to help people is like using gravity as an argument not to pick things off the floor.



Where humans evolved, sugar was a rare foodstuff and hence human ancestors evolved to love the taste of sugar in fresh fruit. At that time, loving sugar helped you live longer and pass on your genes more.
But now, our technology is such that we can easily produce sugar. If we followed this instinct of eating a lot of sugar, we would become obese, and actually live shorter and unhappier lives.

All animals have an instinct to have sex to reproduce. But humans with our technology have invented contraception so can have sex whenever we want with much less consequences. If we followed this instinct we would probably end up very unhappy.


Only humans have enough intelligence to realise that we can serve our own intrests, instead of the intrests of our genes.


&lt;blockquote&gt;We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Also, I&#39;m going to play Godwin&#39;s law and point out that Hitler murdered or force-steralised many disabled or undesirable people. Do you want to be like Hitler?</description>

<p>Not sure I agree fully with that, plenty of animals show hedonism, plenty of animals play, etc.</p>

I remember reading this was true; can’t remember exactly where – it might have to do with the fact that the average substance abuser has a weak sense of control/etc.</p>
