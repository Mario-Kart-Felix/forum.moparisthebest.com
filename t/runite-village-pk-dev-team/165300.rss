[size=20pt]Accepting Again - We can not accept forums dev.     [/size]

          Welcome to my Runite - Village PK Development Topic. In this Topic I will explain the following:


    [b] We Now Have Forums That will Be Sent Through Pm[/b]

    [b]
[ul][li] My Ideas and Thoughts [/li][/ul]

    [b]
[ul][li] Things I have already taken into consideration[/li][/ul]

    [b]
[ul][li] The Client Work[/li][/ul]

    [b]
[ul][li] The Server side work[/li][/ul]

    [b]
[ul][li] My Ideas and Thoughts[/li][/ul]


I am thinking about making the server into a big pking server reasoning behind this is because RuneScapes Pking is gone and people have cravings to kill other players but still have a large community. Thats why I want a stable source or a very trusted Host that can prove they can hold 80+ Players. If we don&#39;t have anyone then I am hoping we can get a great base server that can alone hold 60 - 120 players. My internet is strong but when the limit has been met I lose all connection to the internet. Thats where my Community thought ends.

I want to make it based on a Runescape classic armour everyone always enjoyed which of course was Rune armour for soo long. We will still have barrows and all but there will be the set that stands out the most... Rune Whip, Rune Defender, Rune Boots, Rune P hat, Rune Plate, Rune Plate Legs, just think of that set. I got those items covered.

My most enormous Ideas are where I am taking place now. I want to make a defense system.. One Like RuneScape that actually takes awhile to die when your hit in Dharok or Bandos. Dueling could fall into place there with tank stakers. The last piece to this ideal is a one versus one pking spot.

    [b]
[ul][li] Things I have taken into Consideration[/li][/ul]


I have taken into consideration of only having one kind of party hat available.
Party hat type: Runite
It will have: 13+ Strength Bonus, 20+ Defense bonus in everything else but magic. It will have -20 Magic Defense and Attack.
I have also thought about 7 Dark Bow that is dropped from Dark Beast (Bad at editing NPCS I need help here) Dark Bows Max can be Special like 35/35 and regular about 20/20.. We&#39;ll see.
I have not though much into armours and newer weapons yet but I know I&#39;m adding full Bandos, we will add a special and all.
We will have Vengence in the server. At least working good enough to impress a Pker.
There we are in Considering Ideals.

    
[ul][li] 100% Happening Client Work[/li][/ul]


In our client work section, We will be using a client that has some things in it already so we can get to the server sooner. Our client base could be anything atm I&#39;m not sure which is best.. Our Goal will be to add Vengence, All Combat Capes fully colored correctly and 3 + Bonus in the skill that has a 99.
We want at least 4 new NPCS to become better than bad.
We will have items added by me such as runeite whip, Phat
Custom Items and ect.

    [b]
[ul][li] 100% Happening Server Side Work[/li][/ul]


    [b]
[ul][li] On the top of the list I really wanna add vengence but I don&#39;t exactly know how yet.
    [b][list][li] Spiecal for GodSword[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] Dueling(harder but I hope we get it.)[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] Bonuses Similar to RuneScape[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] NPCs working Attack, Defend, Dieing Emotes[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] Full Dharok Effect[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] Full Pest Control[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] Full Prayer (If Possible)[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] Full Barrows[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] Full Fishing[/li][/list]
    [b][list][li] Basic RuneCrafting (2 Runes per click would be fast enough I think..)[/li][/list]

<p>1- Every personal kill you do, gives you a certain type of currency (rocks, special coins, gems whatever) and once you get a certain amount you can <span class="bbcode-b">buy</span> the special barrows gear. This will cause players to be on continually farming for the currency they need for their good gear.</p>
<p>2- Don’t force the player to lose items on death. That made me want to quit runescape at the THOUGHT of being able to lose items from dying.[/quote]<br>
