    <title>[PI] PvP Facing and Tele Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-pvp-facing-and-tele-problem/445998</link>
    <description>If this is client sided, sorry for the wrong section. I am pretty sure its belongs in this section but I could be wrong.

Problem 1: In my 317 PI when people begin fighting, one of the pkers will be facing one way while the other is facing the correct way. He doesn&#39;t move the wrong way, he just doesn&#39;t move to the right side at all. Can someone help me with this please? Would hate if this bug lasts any longer.

Problem 2: In my spellbook, the gwd teleport won&#39;t work for whatever reason. I tried everything that I could think of but it would not teleport the player.</description>

in your attackplayer.java, find the “Attack” instance where the player actually attacks another player, add somewhere in that method “c.facePlayer”… i think that’s the code. Not entirely sure.</p>
<p>Problem 2: When you click on the teleport button, in your client CMD it should pop up “actionbutton: #####”, where those numbers are, add in clickingbuttons.java (src.server.models.players.packets)…</p>

c.getPA().movePlayer(XXXX, YYYY, H);

<p>fill in the #'s with the actionbutton number you get from your cmd, and with your XXXX and YYYY and H, fill in the coordinates (X coord, Y coord, and Height).<br>
Hope I helped![/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you I will try your suggestions, however, on the first one. I did put c.facePlayer (which i believe is the right code) but still nothing happened.</p>
