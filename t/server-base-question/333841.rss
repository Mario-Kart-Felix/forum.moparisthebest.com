    <title>Server Base question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-base-question/333841</link>
    <description>Well I was looking at the PS Base sticky in the download section, and I had a couple questions.

1) Do the bases have all the items/npcs/emotes in them, I just need to spawn them and set drops, etc.?

2) Will they use the same format as the code you&#39;d edit for regular source code? (EG: When you add in an NPC spawn it&#39;s like 1615    x coord y coord etc...)

That will be all. Thank you.</description>

              <p>Coding requires much more work</p>
<p>When they say “Server Bases” they are bases that have very little coded in them, they usually just have some of the essentials.</p>
<p>Such as, login, walking, talking and if your lucky, trading and private chat.</p>
<p>Also, this doesn’t belong here…</p>
