    <title>About warnings</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/about-warnings/234055</link>
    <description>A lot of people have been messaging me complaining about their warning not being expired when it should of - this is a universal problem, everyone at moparscape/moparisthebest has this problem, the moderators actually have to manually expire the warning. If your removal is delayed, please do not hesitate to drop myself or another member of the staff a line.

Do not make posts about it, if you do the warning will be permanent, and you may even be banned.

Regards,
