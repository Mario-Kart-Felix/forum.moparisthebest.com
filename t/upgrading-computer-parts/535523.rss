    <title>Upgrading Computer Parts</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/upgrading-computer-parts/535523</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to help my grandfather update his computer parts, because it&#39;s about 5 years old and he wants a faster, more efficient computer. But, I&#39;m not that great with making a computer. For now, he just wants a better processor. Right now, he has an [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819115037]Intel Core 2 Duo E8400[/url] processor and a [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128364]GIGABYTE GA-EP45C-UD3R[/url] motherboard.

My question is, will this [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116504]Intel Core i5-3570K[/url] processor work with this [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131819]ASUS P8Z77-V PRO[/url] motherboard?</description>

<p>this is my area of expertise where yours is programming  you could ghost the main hard drive but ud need 2 product keys of course but what id do is make the secondary a recovery backup soo if one harddrive fails ull be able to recover your data by using the secondary…i hope this helps.also its pretty much what muroth said just  alot more detailed i suppose</p>

<p>Just make backups to the extra HDD, it’d be fine. If you’re worried just make recovery discs.</p>
