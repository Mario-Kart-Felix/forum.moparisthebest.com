I just can’t take his shit. Not with all the pressure on top from school. My mom called me the other day and just because i’m closer to my mom than my dad doesn’t make me a momma’s boy he says that all the fucking time and i’m tired of that too, but anyway my mom called me and wanted me to stay with her so i guess thats what i’m doing at least she isn’t a bitch</p>

He’s just changed, he doesn’t talk to anyone in our family anymore or anything.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to say really, I’m at the point where I hate my dad and I’m no longer willing to talk to him even if he apologizes.<br>
All I can recommend is that you try to keep him in your life as much as you can before you call it quits.</p>

You should choose to live your life the best way that works for you.<br>
Whatever will cause you the least stress and will allow you to focus most on your life goals is the best living situation for you.</p>

It’s wrong for your dad to choose a girl over you, but you need to realize that your parents will move on and find new partners in life. It’s important, for your mother’s sake, that you be understanding when she meets a guy and/or gets a boyfriend. She’s probably going through a lonely time in her life (if your parents recently split up) and she is a person too. Try not to make her (and her new boyfriend’s) life hell if she finds another guy to be with.</p>
