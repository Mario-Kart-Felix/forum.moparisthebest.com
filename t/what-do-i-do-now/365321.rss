    <title>What do i do now?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-i-do-now/365321</link>
    <description>Well it is going to be a rough week for me, because of the face that my dad finally chose his girlfriend over me. He has numerously called me &quot;dumb ass&quot; and &quot;idiot&quot;. He told me a lot of stuff just because i told him to calm down. I&#39;m pretty depressed and i&#39;m not sure what to do. It&#39;s kinda lookin like i will be living with my mother (which makes me pretty happy). Before i leave for my mothers should i tell my dad how i feel? or should i do it now?</description>

<p>It’s wrong for your dad to choose a girl over you, but you need to realize that your parents will move on and find new partners in life. It’s important, for your mother’s sake, that you be understanding when she meets a guy and/or gets a boyfriend. She’s probably going through a lonely time in her life (if your parents recently split up) and she is a person too. Try not to make her (and her new boyfriend’s) life hell if she finds another guy to be with.[/quote]<br>

I just can’t take his shit. Not with all the pressure on top from school. My mom called me the other day and just because i’m closer to my mom than my dad doesn’t make me a momma’s boy he says that all the fucking time and i’m tired of that too, but anyway my mom called me and wanted me to stay with her so i guess thats what i’m doing at least she isn’t a bitch</p>

              <p>Well it is going to be a rough week for me, because of the face that my dad finally chose his girlfriend over me. He has numerously called me “dumb ass” and “idiot”. He told me a lot of stuff just because i told him to calm down. I’m pretty depressed and i’m not sure what to do. It’s kinda lookin like i will be living with my mother (which makes me pretty happy). Before i leave for my mothers should i tell my dad how i feel? or should i do it now?</p>
