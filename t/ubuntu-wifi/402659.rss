    <description>Ubuntu Wifi
Most possibly the most weird error you will read about in a while...
So yeah, I have Ubuntu (10.10) on my Netbook. I have finally gotten around to setting up wifi in the house and I have been getting a dodgy connection when using Ubuntu on the netbook. 

The netbook is an emachines em350.

Wireless device is AR9285

What is happening is that I am getting a good connection signal, and it is working but pages load like shit half the time, and quite often they don&#39;t open at all which is annoying me.

What I have noticed though is that when I disconnect the power cable the connection becomes even worse and pretty much no pages load up at all. However, as soon as the cable is reconnected the connection becomes somewhat stable again.

Does anyone know what could be causing this?</description>

              <p>Well I’ve done some research and it seems to be pointing to something to do with PCI express power saving when power is disconnected… Gonna keep looking.</p>
<p>FIXED:</p>
<p>Just went and edited my ‘/usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/wireless’ file so that wifi keeps power when battery in use.</p>
