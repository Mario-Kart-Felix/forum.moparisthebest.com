              <p>make usre u added the wanneshop in client, to link the npc and the shop, and i think what you did wrong is when you add the npc to the autospawn list, you have to add shopkeepers with other shop keepers, if you put a shop keeper in with the mosnters in autospawn it will do that. so just move the code in autospawn so its imbetween 2 other shop keepers…</p>
