    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m pretty good with Java, so I&#39;m normally not the one asking questions but nonetheless I have been stumped by what is probably a simple problem.

I am adding some nice new shops onto a 317 server (Not delta). Everything works fine if you left click on them, but the second you right click -&gt; Trade, you are disconnected. I looked for the case which controls right clicks, and added the same code into that area as I had for the left click (first click).

This made no difference and I keep disconnecting. It&#39;s very frustrating and I&#39;m hoping I am just being blind here.

If someone helps me out well then I guess I will rep++.

Thanks, Eddy.</description>
