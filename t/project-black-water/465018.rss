    <description>[center]Project Black Water


All right so I am looking for a few of the following:
Web Developers
Temp Host
Gave Developers
Staff


Okay so Project Black Water is a RSPS server/community that is owned, programmed and ran by people who do all the work they do is cause they enjoy it.

I am stuck between Militus(317) or, Demethium/TorvaPK637(639) as the base. Both have so much capability to be great. My personal choice is the 317 but after messing around with the 637/639 I do enjoy it.

This will be a serious (kinda) project. If you want to be a part of it, you can&#39;t just bullshit around cause it&#39;s for free. Course, eventually we will get donations and when that time comes I will give 60% to host, and the other 40% to rest of dev team cause I am doing this for the love and learning experience of it all.
