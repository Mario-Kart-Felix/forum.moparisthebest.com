<p>Back ontopic, get the VIN number and run it through one of those online checkers to see if it is actually an original 396SS.  Also, the odometer on that car only goes up to 99,999.

<p>Also, on all old cars like this, check inside the trunk (you should be able to see the inside of the quarter panels) and feel inside of all the wheel wells and such for bondo.  If everything he says is true (actually 22k miles, original 396SS, perfect body with no bondo/fiberglass etc) then it is worth every penny of $8500, otherwise it might not be.</p>

<p>on the title it says the odometer reads at 22,751</p>
<p>I verified the Vin so it is a Real 396SS (done through <a href="http://www.decodethis.com/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.decodethis.com/Home/tabid/36/Default.aspx</a>) may try some other sites aswell</p>
<p>Think the D.M.V could tell me info on the car If I provide the VIN to them?[/quote]<br>
They should be able to as long as the car has been registered in the system with the new title that he is using. They will tell you about how many previous owners it had, if they have wrecked, if it was ever used in illegal actions, also they are able to tell you if the odometer is reading right. Because every time the title is changed, the odometer number changes… Such as one of the owners could have it reading at 80k then he buys it and it reads at 22k… Which means like Moparisthebest said that he is at about 122k miles… But just make sure you take some cash to the D.M.V just incase they charge you, depending on where u live.</p>
