    <title>[PHP] Fun Awesome Code of Goodness</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/php-fun-awesome-code-of-goodness/339720</link>
    <description>(Woot, first post (on these forums))

Basically, I&#39;m looking for some pointers for a project I&#39;m working on in my spare time (which amounts to very little time).
I&#39;ve got... the base layed out for this project, or rather part of the base, and I was wondering if there were any flaws, improvements, or anythign else people would care to alert me to.
Now I know that I&#39;m not the best at PHP, I&#39;m reminded often enough, but I still want to get better, so literally ANYTHING you see that could be improved upon, just let me know.
Also, the reason I&#39;ve put it in Github, at least a part of it, is so that if other people are interested, they can contribute too, so feel free to contribute anywhere with anything, or just let me know which parts suck.
As you might see when looking at the source, I wasn&#39;t kidding when I said base.
http://github.com/ss23/ECommerce is the project URL, and if you don&#39;t have Git (or don&#39;t know what it is, or have a client installed) you can download via the &quot;Download Source&quot; button on the left (I don&#39;t want to link here because it gives you options of formats, and I&#39;m not sure if Github will change it, they change things rather often).

I look forward to hearing anyone&#39;s advice, improvements, or anything else! (And remember, don&#39;t be mean to the PHP noob)</description>

<p>Oh yeah first thing that comes to mind: I saw you doing alot of fwrites(), perhaps it’d be easier to implement a simple logger so you can just do $logger-&gt;log(“OHNOEZHAX”); or use a lambda function like so:<br>
[php]<br>
$write = function($msg) use($h) { // $h being the filehandler<br>
fwrite($h, $msg);<br>
};</p>
<p>// then call it like so:<br>
$write(“foo”);<br>
[/php]</p>
<p>That only works on php5.3 and above, so pick yer poison</p>

<p>Indeed. I figure if I’m going to be using passwords and there’s a chance I’ll release them to public (whether it be me not committing properly or otherwise), I’ll just generate a random one and not worry about it. Still, I wonder how many people bothered trying to log into this account with it :P.<br>
And as you could tell by the paths in that same config file, it’s not even accessible over the internet (at least I would sure hope that someone running wamp/xampp would never make their site visible to the internet…)</p>
<p>Anyone have anything else to add perhaps, more relevance would be appreciated? I figure with my skill, SOMEONE must have something in there I can improve on. Perhaps someone can check the error stuff for me and figure out some logic in there where I might go wrong?</p>
