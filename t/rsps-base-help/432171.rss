    <description>I orignially had a InsidiaX base but it corrupted so i&#39;m gonna start over.

I want a 314 but with 602+ Game frame and Graphics, all skills, xp counter, 666 items, easy coding, donating area. 

Could use help finding a base like that ^ ^ ^

I don&#39;t know how to start a server from scratch so That&#39;s why i need a base. 

Only reason i might need to start over is cause my server says can&#39;t find/locate map.config/file. 
If you could help me fix it ill think of a way to thank you.</description>
