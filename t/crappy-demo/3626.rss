    <title>Crappy demo</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crappy-demo/3626</link>
    <description>Here is a demo of my current build. Working on it right now.  
SRL is a cpu destroyer.  Every random is called every loop. Geno is going to have to optimze it.  This interface will be used by both scar and our up coming r-bot for color-clicking.

 I am still working on it. Expect a closed beta.

It needs a better scar front-end and still has issue with keystroke with multi-applets.  In the process of writing focus managers.

upload to toher places and post links plz

              <p>Looks pretty good right now.  Could probably use major improvements, but how should I know?  I couldn’t see it so clearly on the demo and I know nothing about programming.  So I’ll say great work, and happy cheating!</p>
