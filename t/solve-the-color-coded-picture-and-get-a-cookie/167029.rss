Hello, I can&#39;t get my server to work, I have searched around and corrected various things according to guides and tutorials here on the website, but I still can&#39;t get it to work. Please help. Below is a picture! I&#39;ve tried many things, different compilers, etc.

You might see the picture best if you download the picture I attached.

Heres what the colors mean starting with number 1 (the light green one) of the color coded boxes at the bottom:

1. Runserver.bat
2. System Properties - Environment Variables
3. Java Folder
4. Linksys ROUTER
5. Me talking to my friend trying to join server
6. Router IP Address
7. My Modem Information
8. Ipconfig
9. No-IP
