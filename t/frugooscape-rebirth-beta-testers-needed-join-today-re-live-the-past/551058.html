No you may not. Don’t put your leeched unedited garbage Project Insanity base on here calling it Frugooscape. Frugooscape is a classic for anyone old to Private Servers. One of the most respected osrs servers out there. This is NOT frugooscape, and if you need someone to double check your portforwarding job, you’re definitely new to making servers and you shouldn’t be stealing titles of other people’s work. I’m all for learning to code and everyone starts somewhere so i’m not intentionally flaming. I just think it’s a garbage thing to do to manipulate someone else’s title in a sad ploy to attract players. You are not FrugooScape.<br>
By the way thank you for logging into my server without the use of a proxy client.</p>

<p>It’s not getting crusty, it’s disrespectful to take someone else’s server name and label it onto a crappy Project Insanity. You can’t just say “It’s a rebirth!” every time. A rebirth would be getting the original source and putting it online for people to enjoy again. This server shares 0 similarities to the original Frugooscape, you do not have permission from Frugooscape, and you are just manipulating the name to bring a player count.</p>

This is nearly 100% different. You can actually get into contact with the person that made the source, with a little digging around.<br>
The happy birthday song was invented before the internet existed… There was no where near as many advancements then as there are now.</p>
<p>Unless this person dropped all contact with the internet completely, I don’t see how you can’t find them. You just haven’t tried.</p>

<p>You’re on a forum that’s dedicated to <span class="bbcode-u">runescape private servers</span>. We’re talking about a <span class="bbcode-u">runescape private server</span>. Hence, why we’re “Spazzing out” over it. Because generally, the idea of being on a forum about a specific topic is to talk about that specific topic.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, this isn’t anything compared to how people were responding to one of my old project’s name. There was like 3 pages of discussion on the name and I hadn’t even taken part of it.</p>

Lol sure it’s kind of dumb to take someone else’s runescape private servers name. But at the same time it is just a runescape private server. Why the fudge are you all spazzing out lol? This is so minuscule and the server will never get more then 10 players. Calm y’alls tits.<br>

Lol. I’m not “offended”. However, if I found my server’s name was being used without my permission (Especially if it had a reputation to it, and Frugoscape did), then I would be upset. Therefore, I expressed my opinion on the topic at hand. Which is that he shouldn’t be using the name without permission.</p>

There are not ways to get into contact from people from 100 years ago.<br>
I’m also not talking about the original creator of the source. As that would be probably Insanity (from project insanity), or winterLove (from winterlove…). Unless the makers of Frugoscape actually made there own source… Which I’m unsure of. Again, we are digging into parts that are unrelated to the topic at hand: The name of the server.</p>

You want a historical icon? Hitler. There’s thousands of people named Adolf because Adolf Hitler was such an inspiration. He still is. Granted his actions were wrong. That doesn’t really change how he came to power or how inspiring he was to the people.[/quote]</p>
<p>I quoted you so that you knew I was personally talking to you and replying to you. Not because you are spazzing, And I am not trying to make it so that I was directly insulting you. So i’m sorry if you took it that way just getting your attention is all.</p>
<p>And we are not directly/specifically talking about trademarking and registering but it still applies to this conversation because you are wanting him to “ask for permission” To use a name that no one really owns and they have no trademarks or anything else (not that I know of atleast, But that is why I said “if they own the name then I can see how that is a problem”). So they really do not need to ask for permission.</p>
<p>And the birthday song and Jesus are both analogies. Which makes it relevant because I am putting 2 different topics side by side and putting the same circumstances in both scenarios.</p>
<ol>
<li>A guy named his server frugooscape. So That Means He must ask someone else for permission who named there server frugooscape first? even though they do not own that name to begin with?</li>
</ol>
<p>Now I am using an analogy to help further my case I am not using this example literally. It’s just a scenario for the purpose of explaining and clarifying my case. which is kind of ridiculous for him to ask someone for permission even though the person he has to ask for permission has no authority to even give permission of a name they do not own to begin with.</p>
<p>Analogy: we won’t use the birthday song or jesus anymore this can fit in with anything… If you do something first then someone wants to do the same thing right after you does he really have to ask you for permission? (remember you did not put any copy right or whatever legal stuff to make it so only you can do it) So does he really need to ask for permission? Answer is No. If you buy a Gatorade then I want a Gatorade I do not need to ask you permission to get a Gatorade. ( And I know we aren’t talking literally about Gatorades it is just an analogy just making that clear againl.) No Need to get into the history of creators of the birthday song or Jesus. Just analogies.</p>
<p>But you were talking about the source</p>
<p>You To Him:</p>
<p>"This is nearly 100% different. <span class="bbcode-b">You can actually get into contact with the person that made the source</span> &lt;----<br>
with a little digging around.</p>
<p>The happy birthday song was invented before the internet existed… There was no where near as many advancements then as there are now. &lt;-----just an analogy we are not literally talking about when the birthday song was invented.</p>
<p>Unless this person dropped all contact with the internet completely, I don’t see how you can’t find them. You just haven’t tried."</p>
<p>And I said (if you believe in Jesus).<br>
I know kinda low bringing <a href="http://dictionary.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">dictionary.com</a> into this but just making my point.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">History: “the branch of knowledge dealing with past events.”</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">If you believe that jesus is real</span> and that he made the whole damn earth and created life then I find that history.</p>
<p>But if you do not believe in him then yes he would just be a religious icon.</p>
<p>But that is why I put in parenthesis (if you believe in Jesus)</p>
<p>But yet <span class="bbcode-b">again</span> It is just an <span class="bbcode-b">Analogy</span>.</p>
<p>He does not need to ask for permission to name “his” server frugooscape.</p>
<p>But all of this is meaningless because all I said first was that everyone should calm down a bit. It is just a name.</p>
<p>And before sk8r you said “Imagine if you made one of the most popular servers out there, and then released it, only to find out 3 years later that some random person is using the name “because they liked it”. They’re making money, off your name. And off the reputation you built with your server.<br>
Would that not piss you off even the slightest? Because that would irritate me.”</p>
<ol>
<li>do you really think he is going to get a player base and make money off of it? (your server you are creating is 100X better then his I follow your skarred lands project looks legit but you might not make a single dollar off it or even get a player base and yours is way better! There is no way his will go any farther then yours ever will.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I made a beast server years ago and someone tried to resurrect it, I would NOT care because there is a reason it is offline. either I got sued by jagex so I am staying on the down low (and this guy will get sued to because if jagex did sue frugooscape then I am sure they are still keeping an eye out to see if he puts it back online. So they will see this server and just instantly shut it down again so it is not going to be popular or have any money made off it.)  OR I stopped because I don’t care about private servers anymore so I don’t care about some noob putting a failed version of it online. Because they do not deal with rsps’s anymore.</p>
