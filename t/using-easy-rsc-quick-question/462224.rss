              <p>Yes, you have to make sure that the everything is setup right in next files,</p>
<p>serversided:</p>
<ul>
<li>itemwieldable.xml.gz</li>
<li>itemdef.xml.gz</li>
</ul>
<p>clientsided:</p>
<ul>
<li>items.rscd</li>
<li>animations.rscd</li>
</ul>
<p>[quote=“TannerRSC, post:7, topic:461482”]If you want to use new sprites, the easiest way to find the amount of animation sprites in animations.rscd, is by extracting and opening with notepad. Then you go to the end of the file and click in the last line, then type ctrl+g to see the amount of lines. After you’ve done this open calculator and do: ((amount of lines) - 2) / 8.</p>
<p>Why -2?<br>
The first and the last line aren’t part of a sprite.</p>
<p>Why / 8?<br>
Because every sprite uses 8 lines.</p>
<p>If there aren’t added any new sprites yet, you should have 238 of them.</p>
<p>Now how to find a sprite that fits with your item?</p>
<p>E.g. You want to add a dragon kiteshield.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open itemwieldable.xml</li>
<li>Search for the id of a rune kiteshield</li>
<li>When you have found the rune kiteshield, you should see XXX&lt;…</li>
<li>Take XXX and multiplie by 8, then you know what line you have to be on.</li>
<li>Open animations.xml and type ctrl + g, go to the line you got from last step. You should end-up at the end of the sprite you need. In this case, you should  &gt;squareshield&lt; 6 lines above your textmarker.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to use this sprite?</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy the whole sprite from the kiteshield and paste it after the last sprite in your animations.xml</li>
<li>Change XXX&lt; to the color your item needs.</li>
<li>Save and compress the file to Animations.rscd</li>
</ol>
<p>in itemwieldable, copy the rune kiteshield lines to the end and change XXX&lt; to the sprite you need. Also make sure you change XXX&lt; to the needed itemid. If there arent any items added yet, the new id should be 1290. Here you can also edit the stats of the shield. Now compress the file to Itemwieldable.xml.gz again.</p>
<p>Now edit itemdef.xml, copy the rune kiteshield stuff and paste it at the end of the file, don’t paste it in the middle, since the items are ordered by their id. Change the itzm name and you’re ready.</p>
<p>Now compress the file twice, once as Itemdef.xml.gz and once as Items.rscd</p>
<p>This should be it, if this doesn’t work, feel free to contact me.[/quote]</p>

              <p>it’s probably crashing because you have to update the animations(.rscd). I think, I haven’t made a custom item in a while.</p>
