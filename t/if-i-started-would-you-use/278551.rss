    <title>If I started... Would you use?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/if-i-started-would-you-use/278551</link>
    <description>Alright, I have 2, 3 gigabyte RAM systems, and each have a 350GIG HDD. and i&#39;m building another one. and a 100mbp/s internet connection.

If I started a website, and started hosting servers and such. How many people would actually use this service? because I don&#39;t want to make the site and get everything set up, and no one uses the service.

So how about it? Any ideas? Any suggestions?</description>

              <p>Alright, two machines will be for paid members, and the other machine will be for free members.<br>
On the free members machine, all the free members server will be shoved into there. (It’s going to have a little bit of lag, but it’s free. don’t complain) the paid members will get what they pay for. Even if it means buying more RAM. The servers will be ran with No-IP. But instead of having everyone on the default port (impossible), there will be different ports as in one of the servers may be 98694 and another 98695.</p>
<p>Any more questions?</p>

              <p>Lol. Exactly. Most companies charge like 40 dollars for a 2gig RAM server. You don’t really need that for a RSPS. Unless your server has like 400 people. But, that’s unlikely. I am currently putting the design in HTML.<br>
This project is going to be established. If anyone has any ideas, suggestions, or want to help out you are welcome to help. Although I can not pay you right now.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to go ahead and open the project. Like I said, I have to do the website. MoparScape will be the first place I post when I release. I’ll probably put it in here.<br>
I’ve already figured out the plans and stuff. Which i’ll post right now.</p>
<p>Free - 256MB of RAM, 2GB HD, FTP Access, WebHosting(This uses your 2GB HD), Web hosting is optional.</p>
<p>1.99/MO 512MB of RAM, 4GB HD, FTP Access, WebHosting(This uses your 4GB HD), Web hosting is optional.</p>
<p>2.99/MO 1GB of RAM, 8GB HD, FTP Access, 1GB Web Hosting.</p>
<p>When it gets more and more popular, I will start upgrading the systems. Although the free servers are limited, they are free. I am not sure what the URL will be, but I will post that soon.</p>

              <p>That’s kind of what i’m saying.<br>
When I use to have a server, I didn’t want to pay and I didn’t expect a whole lot when I got it free. Then I realized the PC’s I have. So I decided to come back to MoparScape, learn a little more. Then run servers for other people. I know that I didn’t like paying when I ran a private server. But I didn’t expect a whole lot. But some people want to pay, and get more out of it. I know that 256MB isn’t a lot of RAM. But you are getting it free.<br>
I think I will be releasing it. I am going to sketch out the site, draw it on photoshop, then put it in HTML and then code it in PHP. I am not sure how long this will take, maybe a couple days. I’ll post the URL in this thread.</p>

              <p>Alright, I have 2, 3 gigabyte RAM systems, and each have a 350GIG HDD. and i’m building another one. and a 100mbp/s internet connection.</p>
<p>If I started a website, and started hosting servers and such. How many people would actually use this service? because I don’t want to make the site and get everything set up, and no one uses the service.</p>
<p>So how about it? Any ideas? Any suggestions?</p>
