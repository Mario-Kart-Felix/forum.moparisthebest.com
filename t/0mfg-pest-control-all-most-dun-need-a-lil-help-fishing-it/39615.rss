<p>You guys have nearly no knowledge whatsoever (with exceptions to fedexer and littlesoul.) Endar is nothing special. It is just a smaller upgrade to the new game engine then you guys think. Belive it or not, it is running on the 377 cache, not the 428. It is actually the only client that is running on the 377, MoparScape and BlakeScape both run on the 317s as well as our servers do. You will need to find all the new frames and interfaces that are included with the 377 before you can think about all new Pest Control and things like that. Remember, it us RS2 Private Server cheaters over a year just to get what we have today on the 317. When someone finishes the 428, we will have to all start from scratch again. This is a good idea, but it will take a lot of work. I am sorry that I can’t help. My sincere apologies.</p>

</aside>
<p>It has not taken us over a year to get 317 up to standards, maybe server side. If someone was smart enough before xero to go in and decode all the frames we’d be way ahead, and so would Jagex. You can use any cache with any client, with the exception of the new ones. Using a new deob just means you have to change the frames, the packets, and anything else really that requires it. We have no reason to go up to a higher deob, and those who are experimenting with 428 have no server to do anything on. And whats the point of that if we did? Jagex will just make another update, which I think is their plan as soon as we get our roots planted again. And have us start all over for the third time.</p>
