    <description>I have posted this before, but i lost the post... so yeah.

[quote=&quot;lothy, post:83, topic:70563&quot;][quote author=server dude link=topic=103651.msg1050028#msg1050028 date=1174846129]
these forums are for people to have fun, posta few tuts and basically learn stuff from other people ( well maybe for the 733t c0d3z0rs!!) if they restart this board, theres going to be hardly anyong willing to post there tuts [u]again[/u]
[/quote]
Considering what most of the tutorials are about, that wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing.[/quote]

I agree whole-heartedly with this quote. These forums are a complete mess, and many of our good-tutorial-creators have perished, and dont make anymore tutorials. We need to bring this community up, just like Silab says. I believe that silab is the best server-coder out here at the moment, so i say this to her:
HELP US!!!!!
This community definately needs some cleanup, and some more enforced rules. When the rules began to be enforced,  i dislilked it greatly. But now that i am more mature, i realize, that this commmunity needs... The devil&#39;s grip... to keep it together.
[b] [font=arial][u]We need strictly enforced rules, and im tired of people just &#39;locking&#39; topics. There should be a trash bin, where you move and lock them. So that they aren&#39;t hogging up a part of the forum that should be only used for giving stuff to people[/u][/font][/b](like tutorials).

We need to BEAT the people who keep making this forum bad. And alot of the threads, are very similar, but not similar enough to get locked. All of these spell tutorials and other tuts like that are making this section noob-like, because there are too many tuts that have the same base. Also, i believe that we should just have sub-forums for each category of tutorial, which will keep alot of this mess organised.

This is the big reason that i am making all of these text-based tutorials. We NEED something different. When everything is alike, it is not fun anymore.

I remember when i was a ignorant server noob, looking through the tutorials, adding what i wanted. Even then, i had enough respect to post on nearly every thread i looked at. Now, i am ashamed of looking through these, because i usually cant think of a positive reply. 

If somebody replies to your thread about it being &quot;unique&quot;, that should be the best compliment. Because, nothing here seems to be unique. Everything is the same. All of these &#39;nooby&#39; tuts, are just a waste of everybody&#39;s time. The only people who add these tuts, are selfish people who want every single feature in their server, and cant code by themselves

[hr][hr][hr]

Moparscape is ran by a coder who coded well, and had a vision that people who joined would have(or achieve) some sort of coding ability.

But what alot of people do, is just copy+paste voids, so they dont have to forget any &quot; ) ; s and stuff like that. Less than half of the people who post tutorials in moparscape have any ability to code.

Now, to the advertisement section. The advertisement section is just a mess, 1/120 people who post threads there have nearly no ability to code, and everything confuses them. Its not their fault. Now, about 30/120 of the people who advertise their server on the advertisement section steal people&#39;s accounts.

The Development Help section. . . is not as bad as it is thought to be. People learn alot by posting their problems. The problem in there, is when people post stuff that cant be fixed without prior knowledge on what he/she added and his/her source. Like . . .

&quot;HELP!&quot;
&quot;I get liek 1OO errors! Can anybody help me?&quot;

About 70/100 posts there are hopeless.


Client hacking, wonderful. Not many posts there, and everything is independent. I feel thats one of the better sections. Still, 1/15 threads there suck.


RSC server development, so-so. Everything that gets noticed there is great, but there are alot of people who dont know java trying it.


Aryan PS - DEAD.


Downloads section- shit. Half of the downloads are the same on the inside, but different on the outside, where actually, what you want, is more stuff on the inside.</description>
