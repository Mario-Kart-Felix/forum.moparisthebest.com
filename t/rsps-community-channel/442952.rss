Hello everyone, I am new to MoparScape under my new name, but that&#39;s a bit off the point here...
I had the idea of a RuneScape Private Server YouTube community channel where everyone can send in videos advertising their servers, PK videos, anything really! 
So earlier I made my channel, RSPvtServer and hope to get some involvement in it. 
Interested? Here&#39;s all you need to know.
The clips must be from a RSPS.
You must have created the clip or have permission from the person who made the clip to submit it.
No copyrighted music. Commentary preferrable, but anything really.
And that&#39;s it! 

So basically, send me a private message on RSPvtServer with the title &quot;submission&quot; and the link to the video. You must include &quot;I give RSPvtServer rights to use my clip on his own channel.&quot; in the message.
I will review it and probably upload it within the hour I see the message.
... Yeah. That&#39;s it.</description>

<p>Props for attempting to do something creative, but you’ll need to be careful with Jagex if they’re as strict as they used to be. I’ve had numerous RSPS videos removed. I’ve also had a few remain there for months and they still are available. I don’t know how long an entire channel could last though.</p>

<p>I know what disclaimers to add and what not, but yeah, good point.</p>
