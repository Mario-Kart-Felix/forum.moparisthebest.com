    <description>Hello peeps

I&#39;ve tried for hours to make a house , but it wont work. if i place objects , all walls have like a bookcase or something on it. i need a normal wall , a normal door and a normal roof. 
thats pretty easy in my eyes , so i would like it if anyone could tell me. It doesnt matter what kind of wall you got , but it has to fit for a house.

A stone wall or a Wood wall.

Stone as in
