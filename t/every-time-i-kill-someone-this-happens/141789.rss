              <p>What you’re seeing there is called a stack trace.</p>
<p>Stack trace: A stack trace provides information on the execution history of the current thread and lists the names of the classes and methods that were called at the point when the exception occurred. A stack trace is a useful debugging tool that you’ll normally take advantage of when an exception has been thrown.</p>
<p>As it said it shows you what was being called when the exception occurred. So to find out what’s wrong you would go to the first line of that stack trace.</p>
<blockquote>at client.Attack(client.java:19744)</blockquote>
<p>That’s saying the exception occurred in the attack method in client.java on line 19744.</p>
<p>So you would go into your client.java and find line 19744 and fix the error.</p>
