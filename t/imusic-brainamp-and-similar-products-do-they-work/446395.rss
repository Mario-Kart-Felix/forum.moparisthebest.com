    <title>iMusic Brainamp and similar products, do they work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/imusic-brainamp-and-similar-products-do-they-work/446395</link>
    <description>We&#39;ve had a discussin about iDoser a year or so ago, and it seemed to work for some people. If you don&#39;t remember, iDoser was a program which could make you high using sounds. 

Today I found a forumpost somewhere about something similar. Using sound to increase brain activity, and making you smarter. Sure, this sounds great, but I&#39;m quite sceptical. The claims they make sound absurd, such as an IQ increase of 33 points. I&#39;ve listened to a sample, but didn&#39;t notice any difference. To me, it&#39;s just music with a flange effect.

So once again I turn to you guys. Anyone has experience with &#39;brain entrainment&#39;, or can link to a scientific article?</description>

Binaural auditory beats affect vigilance performance and mood.

Abstract
When two tones of slightly different frequency are presented separately to the left and right ears the listener perceives a single tone that varies in amplitude at a frequency equal to the frequency difference between the two tones, a perceptual phenomenon known as the binaural auditory beat. Anecdotal reports suggest that binaural auditory beats within the electroencephalograph frequency range can entrain EEG activity and may affect states of consciousness, although few scientific studies have been published. This study compared the effects of binaural auditory beats in the EEG beta and EEG theta/delta frequency ranges on mood and on performance of a vigilance task to investigate their effects on subjective and objective measures of arousal. Participants (n = 29) performed a 30-min visual vigilance task on three different days while listening to pink noise containing simple tones or binaural beats either in the beta range (16 and 24 Hz) or the theta/delta range (1.5 and 4 Hz). However, participants were kept blind to the presence of binaural beats to control expectation effects. Presentation of beta-frequency binaural beats yielded more correct target detections and fewer false alarms than presentation of theta/delta frequency binaural beats. In addition, the beta-frequency beats were associated with less negative mood. Results suggest that the presentation of binaural auditory beats can affect psychomotor performance and mood. This technology may have applications for the control of attention and arousal and the enhancement of human performance.</blockquote>

<p>Like I said, the result they claim are obvious bullshit. But there is scientific research backing the general idea that something like this could work. Besides, some of you claimed iDoser worked, so that was either the placebo effect or sound can actually influence your brain.</p>
<p>I haven’t read this file completely, but at least on the second page it states that there were some effects (recovering repressed memories, that is :D) <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/brainwaves/2006/theclinicalguidetosoundandlight.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.stanford.edu/group/brainwaves/2006/theclinicalguidetosoundandlight.pdf</a></p>
<p>I’m not saying I believe this, and I’m definately not going to buy it (I can probably find a download somewhere, if I want to test it).</p>
