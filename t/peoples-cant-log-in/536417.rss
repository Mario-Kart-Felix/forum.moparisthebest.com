    <description>Hello moparscape members, i need help with my PI server, im using Cleaned Pi.

Peoples cant log in to my server, i changed all IPS at client.
&quot;error connecting to server&quot;

I can log in, but another person cant.

On another server all can log in and play. This problem is only with this clen pi, maybe its port problems?</description>
