    <title>Can someone really help me with this error plleaaase?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-really-help-me-with-this-error-plleaaase/270086</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve had this error for as long as i can remember and that&#39;s what stopped me from continuing making runescape private servers, but now i want to get back into the servers and i still have this error. When i run my server it says &quot;Error: Unable to startup listener on 5555 - port already in use?&quot;. I know i have to open it or something but i just don&#39;t know much about this, so if anyone can help me it would be much appreciated.</description>

              <p>Open up a Command Prompt, type “netstat -b -a”</p>
<p>Look through the results, looking for ‘5555’. Go into task manager and kill the process of the program using port 5555.</p>
