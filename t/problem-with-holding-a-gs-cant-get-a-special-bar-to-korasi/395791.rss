I changed to my full screen client so I had to convert a lot of stuff. I&#39;ve tried everything to get this problem gone. I was able to fix claws and all that other shit but the godswords are giving me problems. 

Please let me know how to fix

- Also I cannot get the special bar for korasi to appear. Please help
