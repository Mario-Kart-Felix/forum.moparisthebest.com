    <title>I need some help with ids... not lists</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-some-help-with-ids-not-lists/231089</link>
    <description>well i know alot of you will bag me out, but please help. if you dont have anything constructive to add dont bother.

I have an older source with old silabsoft item id&#39;s i.e 11000 istead of 14000. Items dont show as items just junk well they are items not what i want them to be :)
i think thats right, i&#39;m not really 100% sure how to fix this but i know doing it would be very slow.
i was hoping that somebody could upload an item.java and item.cfg with asll of the updated &quot;silabsoft&quot; client ids. or find a source that has all of them as i can not find one.

Thanks,
~Mike</description>
