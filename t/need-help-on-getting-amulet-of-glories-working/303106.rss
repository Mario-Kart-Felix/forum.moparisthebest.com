    <description>Hello everyone i was possibly wondering if someone could tell me how to get the amulet of glories working or how to get a portal to tele u from like lvl 46 wilderness without giving u the sM(&quot;you cannot teleport from 20wilderness and above&quot;); The reason im asking is because on the server im created a clanwars.. well its already created but i dont wanna let anyone know yet bc there isnt really anyway to get out. without walking to magebanks or going to 20- wildy and teleporting. i would want the glories to give u 3 different teleports the first one to edgeville
the second one to magebanks and the 3rd one to home which i would wanna add that at least. i would appreciate the help guys bye.</description>
