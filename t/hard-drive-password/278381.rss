    <title>Hard Drive password?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hard-drive-password/278381</link>
    <description>Well at my 6th form in the IT tech office today we had a laptop brought to us and some idiot has set a password on the hard drive, so basically it cant be booted into at all, the BIOS asks for the password and 3 incorrect attempts moves on to the next booting device on the list. Anyone got a way to fix this? otherwise we&#39;ve got to spend £89 on a new laptop hard drive for the school and that budget is needed elsewhere really</description>

<p>The password is probably stored on a flash chip instead of the actual disk platter, so a magnet wouldn’t do anything.</p>

Sadly you can only flash the hard drive when it’s unlocked in the first place. As you need to get too a boot stage. Only BIOS (I think) can be flashed before devices are initialised.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I emailed my boss the idea this is what he replied[/quote]</p>
<p>Well if you can an OS booted from a CD use <a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/</a> and use the ATA Password Tool which claims to remove a HD password from any *ATA hardisk (However the websites only makes a refernece to an IDE disk).</p>
<p>If your just plain stupid and daring I read somewhere that there is a specific EEPROM chip that only contains the password and if you manage to open it, (Dont ask how) exposing it to UV light for 10 minutes will flash it.</p>
<p>While discovering ultimate boot CD I also discovered <a href="http://www.rockbox.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Rockbox</a> which is a free open source mp3/mp4 player firmware for devices like those Archos’ and even Ipods. (It relates to the password thing because when replacing the firmware on some hard drives the password can get locked.)</p>
<p><img src="http://themes.rockbox.org/themes/320x240/boofers/wps-Boofers2.png" alt width="320" height="240"><br>
Thats just an example on an Ipod Video.</p>

<p>Call the hardware manufacturer, there has to be a way around this.  Maybe a default password or a password reset jumper.</p>

I know what he’s talking about… I modded my Xbox a while ago, and had to find the HDD pass out the hard way. I had to get to one of the chips on the mobo, and hook up some wires to the legs, and send the data through the serial port, and find it out that way… Not sure if the process is the same for a laptop. This might be beneficial for your company though. It brute forces the pass of a hard drive.</p>

Zyle, you know you can just hotswap an Xbox with your pc and unlock it that way.</p>

formatting it wont work the password is in the hard drives firmware that wont reset with a format</p>

              <p>Well at my 6th form in the IT tech office today we had a laptop brought to us and some idiot has set a password on the hard drive, so basically it cant be booted into at all, the BIOS asks for the password and 3 incorrect attempts moves on to the next booting device on the list. Anyone got a way to fix this? otherwise we’ve got to spend £89 on a new laptop hard drive for the school and that budget is needed elsewhere really</p>
