[b][size=18pt][u]WELCOME MOPAR DEVOS WEB DESIGNERS AND WIKI CONTRIBUTERS[/u][/size][/b]

I am currently working a server (no its not a OSRS based) but it contains majority amount of OSRS models including toxic blow pipe rod of ivandis , etc etc etc etc!! Has Zulrah, Kraken, Castillo, and much more. I started this from scratch cleaned up bugs and dupes added a working 100% boss pets system and fixed up some more stuff. I am looking for a web developer and a good java devoloper. I am a working man so I don&#39;t have the amount of time like I used to to code. Im trying to make this server unique but have an OSRS implicate to it with plenty of OSRS stuff. Currently no name for the server but as of now its called beta. Leave skype name or add me on [b]skype[/b]. Im always replying to serious individuals. Please also message me your age I am trying to deal with [b]mature[/b] individuals.

Looking forward to meet yall also thank you moparscape contributers for keeping this website alive!!
