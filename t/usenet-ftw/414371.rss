    <title>USENET ftw</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/usenet-ftw/414371</link>
    <description>Normally I wouldn&#39;t start a topic about something I found that is fucking amazing (even though most of you already know about/use usenet) but in this case I had to. Basically ive been using bittorrent for a long time about 5 or 6 years and the first time I got a DCMA violation letter I started using a service called BTGuard which is a SOCKS5 proxy for bit-torrent clients. It cut my speed to about half but I was okay with this seeing that I wouldn&#39;t get another letter. Well I moved about a year ago and stopped using the service since I was with a new ISP but about a week ago I got another DCMA email and I was pretty mad (even though it really didnt mean shit). So I looked at BTGuard again and choose their VPN plan this time. Well it was shit and it cost 3 dollars more a month ($10) so I was looking at alternatives. Then I came across Usenet on a lifehacker guide and it led me to how to get started with usenet. So I bought a $10 a month plan from UseNetServer because it was highly rated and included SSL encryption. Then I bought a VIP membership to NZB matrix and started downloading.

All I can say is wow...ive known about usenet for a long time, about two years, and was really just too lazy to research into it, but it is maxing out my DL speed from my provider on every download I have completed. At first it was decently fast until I figured my ip was throttling it so I changed to the HTTPS port 443 and enabled SSL and it was blazing fast.

All the content I can find on bittorrent is on NZB matrix so im not missing bittorrent at all.

Anyways whats your guys view on usenet and how long have you been using it?</description>

<p>Also another plus of USENET for me…my University blocks torrent traffic…I have no idea how to get around it I tried allowing only encrpyted connections and using port 80 or 443 which cant be blocked since thats http and https traffic but I still cant get a connection on any torrents…</p>
<p>But when I use a secure ssl connection with usenet and use port 443 I can download with full speeds over the university wireless, this is great! My university also doesn’t require verification to the wireless so I just use mac address cloning so they cant block my computer based on my bandwith usage associated with a certain mac address.</p>

How does your search engine compare to this free one?<br>

<p>Also, what client do you use?  I’ve found sabnzbd+ to be quite excellent, I still just use this free usenet server over IPv6:<br>

<p>Also you would probably never have torrent problems if you only accepted or made encrypted connections.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Hmm, looked at that site and I couldn’t fine what I was looking for. I think you would like NZBMatrix alot better you just type your search query, select a category and its basically right there. Best part is, is that it interfaces with sabnzbd+. If you wanna take a peek at it I can let you use my login information to try it out.</p>
<p>sabnzbd+ is what I use and I find it to work great and I love the interface. My ISP doesnt provide IPv6 so I cant use that but im pretty happy with that I have now even thought I have to pay for it.[/quote]</p>
<p>My ISP doesn’t provide IPv6 either, but Hurricane Electric does:<br>

<p>If I was only downloading 50 dollars or so worth of content a month it probably wouldn’t be worth it. But when im downloading 2-3 movies a day and a new game every week I think its a small price to pay compared to what I would be paying if I had to buy all that stuff legitimately.</p>

              <p>Normally I wouldn’t start a topic about something I found that is fucking amazing (even though most of you already know about/use usenet) but in this case I had to. Basically ive been using bittorrent for a long time about 5 or 6 years and the first time I got a DCMA violation letter I started using a service called BTGuard which is a SOCKS5 proxy for bit-torrent clients. It cut my speed to about half but I was okay with this seeing that I wouldn’t get another letter. Well I moved about a year ago and stopped using the service since I was with a new ISP but about a week ago I got another DCMA email and I was pretty mad (even though it really didnt mean shit). So I looked at BTGuard again and choose their VPN plan this time. Well it was shit and it cost 3 dollars more a month ($10) so I was looking at alternatives. Then I came across Usenet on a lifehacker guide and it led me to how to get started with usenet. So I bought a $10 a month plan from UseNetServer because it was highly rated and included SSL encryption. Then I bought a VIP membership to NZB matrix and started downloading.</p>
<p>All I can say is wow…ive known about usenet for a long time, about two years, and was really just too lazy to research into it, but it is maxing out my DL speed from my provider on every download I have completed. At first it was decently fast until I figured my ip was throttling it so I changed to the HTTPS port 443 and enabled SSL and it was blazing fast.</p>
<p>All the content I can find on bittorrent is on NZB matrix so im not missing bittorrent at all.</p>
<p>Anyways whats your guys view on usenet and how long have you been using it?</p>
