No it was just designed to be aerodynamically efficient but the guy didn’t actually understand aerodynamics. And looks for a car are something that aren’t necessarily aerodynamic related, they could’ve made the charger look like whatever they wanted but they chose that shape, F1 cars are designed for aerodynamics sure but they still have a style about them. You can compare the looks of any two similar things. You could compare the looks of a plane and a car or a boat and a jetski, sure they are designed for different purposes but styling is whatever the designer wants with whatever restrictions that mode of transport offers. Thats like saying you couldnt compare an abstract painting to a figure painting, but in fact you can because you can say that you prefer this one to that one.</p>

<p>The Dodge Charger SRT8 (along with pretty much all other high performance and/or luxury American cars) comes with a high quality leather interior that looks great.  Roll bars? What are you talking about?</p>
<p>With the second line, you seem to be referring to the 1970 Plymouth Superbird, which was an all out racing car.  By nascar regulations chrysler had to make one car for every dealership they owned to enter it in a nascar race.  At the time they had 200 dealerships, and so they made 200 cars.  That car beat both ford and chevy by a longshot and so regulations the next year pretty much banned it.  You can’t really take an all out racecar and compare it with a luxury car, that would be like me comparing an F1 car to the Charger and saying the F1 is uglier.</p>
<p>Define ‘good engine’ then?  I guess I would define it as a very reliable engine, that is easy to work on, that produces massive amounts of power.  Not just at high RPMs either, but throughout the entire range.  It also does all of this at a reasonable cost.  Many American engines fit that description, and I’m not aware of any foreign ones that do.</p>

</aside>
<p>Again, where did you get this list and what did they use to define ‘top engine’.  Refer to my note above about what I see as a ‘good engine’.</p>
<p>I have had a lot of experience with many different American cars and trucks, and I have found the quality and reliability to be excellent.  For example my 1989 Chevrolet S10 Baja came with a nice 4.3L V6 engine, and the engine finally blew two years ago with 314,000 some-odd miles on it.  When the odometer read 310,000 miles I felt confident enough in it’s reliability to take it on a 4042 mile road trip to the Grand Canyon and back, I doubt many Germans could say that about their cars, is Germany even that far across? Seems pretty high-quality to me.  I have since put in a 5.7L 350ci V8 with relative ease and expect another 300,000+ miles from it.  Can you do that with foreign cars?</p>
<p>Big block engines are very easy to maintain, much easier than german engines that are 100% computer controlled.  A new air filter every 6 or 8 thousand miles, new oil and filter every 3 or 6 thousand miles (depending on conventional or synthetic) and new spark plugs and wires every 36 or so thousand miles and they will run for a very long time.  My 7.4L 454 has 120,000 miles on it, and my dad’s has 150,000 miles, both still run great.[/quote]</p>
<p>A classic muscle car that doesn’t have all of those electronics controlling it’s engine is more consistent in bracket racing anyways. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>A good engine is a good engine. Both my dad’s and my cutlass have lasted over 15 years of racing. Those massive power plants come cheap. It’s a lot cheaper to make a Chevrolet engine powerful more than a four cylinder. You have to supercharge the four cylinder in some way to make up for the displacement it’s lacking. My cutlass does deep 12s in the quarter mile, that was around a $1,500 job with non-performance parts. As for a four cylinder, that’s about a $20,000 job. You may save gas, but really? You spent almost $19,000 less, I think you’re not out any money.</p>

<p>BMW has been known for electrical problems. Just might throw that out there for ya. The reliability comes with a good maintained car. Most Americans don’t get oil changes and tune ups regularly and just let their engine rot. As for the Japanese engines, that’s all you saw in the shop getting fixed.</p>

<p>Japan makes good motorcycles, ATVs, TVs, radios, computer parts etc.  But they have never, ever, made a decent car.</p>
<p>As far as Germans, they make good guns, and maybe their cars are decent, but compared to American cars they are insanely overpriced.  For example, you can get a BMW, but for the same price you can have at least 2, maybe 3 or 4 American cars that are just as fast or faster, easier and cheaper to work on, and just as nice.  So why would anyone with half a brain ever buy a German car?</p>

<p>American cars have all 4 of those qualities, at a fraction of the price too, so again, why?[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t count a plastic interior or rollcages as luxury.<br>
Nor do I think mopar cars look nice with a 3ft spoiler on the back, or their body lines that don’t flow but instead peak off every single panel.<br>
While I’m on the subject, a good engine doesn’t mean a massive powerplant as you americans think.</p>
<p>Next bullshit statement from you is welcomed.</p>

<p>Yeah I must admit I hadn’t seen the car since I was heading off for an exam I just WIKI’ed it.</p>
<p>The Viper was slightly modified in all honesty though! Nevertheless I can’t deny it a good time. I’d like to see some other production cars give it a shot though.</p>

<p>Doesn’t look like a production car to me.  They got away with it by calling it the fastest ‘street legal’ car on the track, you can stick turn signals on an F1 car and make it street legal, but that wouldn’t be fair either would it? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I was mainly pointing out that if BMW can do better with one of their production cars, why haven’t they?[/quote]<br>
everyone in the UK drives those around didn’t you know!?</p>
