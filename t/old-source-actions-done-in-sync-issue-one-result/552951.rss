    <title>(Old source) Actions done in sync issue - one result</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-source-actions-done-in-sync-issue-one-result/552951</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a very old project (Allstar-based to be specific) and have run into a problem. If your solution to this problem is anything to do with dropping this source, please leave the thread without commenting now.

It&#39;s not often I post a help topic regarding RSPS but I have searched high and low for this issue&#39;s fix or any hint to the issue. I&#39;ve only found one thread on R-S which had no valuable information or solution.

Anyway, here&#39;s my problem:

Actions that occur in sync are causing a variety of issues, but there are mainly two:
A) Some interactions cause the client to freeze, involves interaction with an NPC for all cases I&#39;ve seen.
B) Some interactions cause only one result to be performed, but do not cause the client to freeze. Basically, combat.

A: Click an object at the exact time you&#39;d be hit by an npc, attack an npc at the exact time it would have overhead text (fixed this one with a dirty check, would prefer to kill the bug, not avoid it) are some examples where the client would freeze. I believe this produces an error in the console. I can check and post a picture tonight if it does. I believe these errors are caused by packet issues in this situation. I&#39;m not sure if this one is client-sided or not.

B: This one is pretty limited to combat as far as I can tell. I&#39;m assuming it has something to do with sending the hitUpdate.

[ul][li]If two players attack an NPC at the exact same time (by same time I mean the exact same time, where in a correct server, it would just sent 2 hitsplats on top of each other, similar to a dds spec. In fact, this problem might be the reason the dds spec in these servers have a delay between hits), only one hitsplat appears. If two NPCs attack a player at the same time, only one hitsplat appears. In both of these situations, only one player&#39;s/npc&#39;s damage is applied (the one on the hitsplat).[/li]
[li] If a player eats a piece of food at the same time a hitsplat would occur from an NPC, the healing is ignored and the damage from the NPC happens with your current HP (this might be a different issue.)[/li][/ul]


This has obviously been fixed in later relases (Project Insanity, and literally everything else) and maybe even closer dated projects to Allstar. Tonight, I will post the client freezing error and compare some updating in my source to another source with this fixed, but I post the question ahead of time to brainstorm any ideas, and possibly even a solution.

If you&#39;ve got experience with this or questions, I hope you&#39;ll take the time to post. This has been a headache for quite some time, and hopefully isn&#39;t as bad is it&#39;s seeming to be.</description>

<p>Can you elaborate?</p>
<p>I’m not sure where to look from here. I’ll check out other sources and see if they have this problem, and if not see how they’re doing their updates. I’m assuming it’s server-sided but I’m not sure on the extent. All I know is that the hitsplats seem to be causing a crash or freeze if another interaction is setting some type of update to be true. And it <span class="bbcode-u">only</span> happens if the object is clicked right as the hitsplat would be loaded. I’ll make sure that if the hitsplat is loaded and an object is clicked, then it won’t freeze, but I’m pretty sure it won’t. It <span class="bbcode-u">only</span> happens if the NPC is going to send overhead text at the same time the hitsplat is loaded. In short, updateRequired screws up hitUpdateRequired, or vice versa somewhere for this situation.</p>
<p>If anyone has any other ideas, please let me know.</p>

              <p>Turns out that PI does not have that hitsplat functionality for NPCs. It has it for players, but only for the second hitsplat occuring at the exact same time, more than 2 will just reset to the first one. It utilizes a hitUpdateRequired2 function for weapons such as the dark bow and dds on NPCs. At least for the original source. I might just have to use the cheapfix for the time being for B, the damage now applies correctly at least. I can look into it later and incorporate a second hitUpdate to fix the delays. Annoying, but it’ll work for now until I can find a workaround.</p>
<p>For the food problem, it should be as simple as rewriting food (I’ve never seen something written worse in my life) so that the update can apply healing as it occurs if the player is in combat. Other sources have this set up and I was planning to rewrite my food anyway, so I’ll see how they manage their current hp.</p>
<p>Anyway, most of the problems from A are happening when updateRequired is true and another update such as textUpdateRequired (in the case of a talking npc) is triggered, it causes a T2 error. This was cheapfixed by just adding an if-check to check if updateRequired is false or not, and if it is, then the NPC can use the overhead text.</p>
<p>For the NPC attacking you as you click an object, this is an array out of bounds exception causes at client.method34, or client.updateEntities in renamed clients. It is the line that draws the hitsplat image. It again has something to do with updateRequired, because it was “fixed” by setting updateRequired = false every time I click an object.</p>
<p>I’m going to have to really dig my heels into fixing my updating it looks like.</p>
<p>Any ideas on these that I can sleep on?</p>

              <p>The issue with the hitsplats is my top priority right now. I’m going to have to dig into other sources around this age and see if they have the same issue, and compare future releases.</p>
<p>There’s obviously a lack of functionality to update the NPC with 2 hitsplats at the same time. The dragon dagger and dragon claws have a delay between hitsplats, most likely for this reason. Even without having the code in front of me, each attack is going to be pushed to the next cycle in this source.</p>
<p>I messaged another member and they said this, which basically just repeats what I said (the server only knows to ever send one single update at a time, it can’t show 2 hitsplats at the same time, so one is ignored).</p>
<blockquote>I think when a player attacks an NPC it sets the update inside the NPC that a player has hit them. But it loops through every player in the process(), so only the last player interaction would be the one to be written (the last player is the most recent process() call)
<p>The server as is does not keep track of all attackers, it just defines an attacker.<br>
This makes sense to me because when two attacks happen in the same tick (one loop through the process() for everything) it will send the hit update once. but it is still possible to get a second hit marker if they happen in seperate ticks.</p>

<p>This all isn’t very technical, but there’s obviously a fix somewhere to be able to read the extra hits and thus fix this problem, as well as the dragon dagger/claws special attack delay.</p>

              <p>You say sync issue – I think concurrency, however it doesn’t seem from your explanation that’s the case.</p>
<p>Sounds more like a decoding problem to be honest, most modern bases fix this by queuing up received messages and processing them every cycle (typically maximum of 10 or 25 the rest are dropped)</p>
<p>Apollo makes this process go in parallel by splitting frame representations from the handlers where as in PI and other bases they are done together.</p>

              <p>I’m using a very old project (Allstar-based to be specific) and have run into a problem. If your solution to this problem is anything to do with dropping this source, please leave the thread without commenting now.</p>
<p>It’s not often I post a help topic regarding RSPS but I have searched high and low for this issue’s fix or any hint to the issue. I’ve only found one thread on R-S which had no valuable information or solution.</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s my problem:</p>
<p>Actions that occur in sync are causing a variety of issues, but there are mainly two:<br>
A) Some interactions cause the client to freeze, involves interaction with an NPC for all cases I’ve seen.<br>
B) Some interactions cause only one result to be performed, but do not cause the client to freeze. Basically, combat.</p>
<p>A: Click an object at the exact time you’d be hit by an npc, attack an npc at the exact time it would have overhead text (fixed this one with a dirty check, would prefer to kill the bug, not avoid it) are some examples where the client would freeze. I believe this produces an error in the console. I can check and post a picture tonight if it does. I believe these errors are caused by packet issues in this situation. I’m not sure if this one is client-sided or not.</p>
<p>B: This one is pretty limited to combat as far as I can tell. I’m assuming it has something to do with sending the hitUpdate.</p>
<p>[ul][li]If two players attack an NPC at the exact same time (by same time I mean the exact same time, where in a correct server, it would just sent 2 hitsplats on top of each other, similar to a dds spec. In fact, this problem might be the reason the dds spec in these servers have a delay between hits), only one hitsplat appears. If two NPCs attack a player at the same time, only one hitsplat appears. In both of these situations, only one player’s/npc’s damage is applied (the one on the hitsplat).[/li]<br>
[li] If a player eats a piece of food at the same time a hitsplat would occur from an NPC, the healing is ignored and the damage from the NPC happens with your current HP (this might be a different issue.)[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>This has obviously been fixed in later relases (Project Insanity, and literally everything else) and maybe even closer dated projects to Allstar. Tonight, I will post the client freezing error and compare some updating in my source to another source with this fixed, but I post the question ahead of time to brainstorm any ideas, and possibly even a solution.</p>
<p>If you’ve got experience with this or questions, I hope you’ll take the time to post. This has been a headache for quite some time, and hopefully isn’t as bad is it’s seeming to be.</p>
