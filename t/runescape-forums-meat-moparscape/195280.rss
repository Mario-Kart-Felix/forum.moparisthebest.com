    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-forums-meat-moparscape/195280</link>
    <description>I was reading through some of the older runescape topics and found that a user named lib or something posted about the person on urnescape forums posted a topic about how his 5 year old brother played moparscape without him knowing (5 years? WHAT THE FUCK , THEY SHOULD BAN HISS AS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE 13 TO PLAY!) Well anyways xxlegitxx posted I believe saying he was from moparscape (not mentionting mitb just saying moparscape) And about how we were not as stupid and virus infested as they thought we were and that we weren&#39;t  Doing all this shit..


I thought It was pretty funny and I was thinking I would make a topic on the runescape forums about I playe moparscape is it a virus!@!!! .. Just to get some laughs.. I may do this I may not depending on how I feel.

I was wondering if anybody has and suggestions on what to post or if I should , or if jagex has now enforced a forum rule on not to post such topic&#39;s.This was really funny last time as it would this time. Just wondering if this place would want some non-violent non-flaming fun?</description>
