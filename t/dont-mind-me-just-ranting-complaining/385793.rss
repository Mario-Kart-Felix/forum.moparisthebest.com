    <description>Feel free to join in though.

Rant 1: I really hate how certain people (that I know in real life) use memes and post really old shit that really isn&#39;t funny anymore, and everyone else joins in with them and then infest facebook with all sorts of newfaggotry. Everyone will comment saying &quot;OMG that&#39;s so funny!&quot;, etc., and the poster&#39;s popularity level jumps. I don&#39;t know why but it just really pisses me off to see people using memes on facebook and in real life. On other websites, I&#39;d be fine.

Rant 2: I opened my eyes a little wider and looked around and saw how much bullying is going on in my school. Seriously, the amount is amazing. I saw three people getting put in headlocks and getting called names when I was walking down the hall to my class. Shits fucked up. I myself get bullied by a few people. It was way worse in middle school. I almost got my neck broken because one kid was forcing my head onto my desk and my neck was bending to the right and it was sore for the next week or so. I also remember how people would pull out my hair because I&#39;ve got long hair. Although I guess it&#39;s probably worse in high school now: One bully takes my papers and just crumples them up and slobbers all over them right in front of the teacher (sits in the front row, she sees it all the time, never does shit about it), he also throws any writing utensils I have away, and punches me, slaps me, knees me, etc. Other times with other bullies I just get put into headlocks to the point where I swear I&#39;m going to die this time, or I get punched and slapped.

Rant 3: One of my closest friends has become an extreme dick over the past few weeks. He plays DnD and always just sits around eating food, playing computer games, etc., and yet he tells me that because I&#39;m a programmer, I&#39;m going to be forever alone, will never get laid (even though he too is a virgin), the book I&#39;m reading (Visual C++ 2010 for Beginners) is my &quot;virgin manual&quot;, yet all he talks about is fucking dungeons and dragons. I have pretty much lost all my friends, now they&#39;re all acquaintances because we don&#39;t have much in common any more.

Just thought I&#39;d let out what all has been going on in my mind.</description>

Although I guess it’s probably worse in high school now: One bully takes my papers and just crumples them up and slobbers all over them right in front of the teacher (sits in the front row, she sees it all the time, never does shit about it), he also throws any writing utensils I have away, and punches me, slaps me, knees me, etc. Other times with other bullies I just get put into headlocks to the point where I swear I’m going to die this time, or I get punched and slapped.</p>
<p>Rant 3: One of my closest friends has become an extreme dick over the past few weeks. He plays DnD and always just sits around eating food, playing computer games, etc., and yet he tells me that because I’m a programmer, I’m going to be forever alone, will never get laid (even though he too is a virgin), the book I’m reading (Visual C++ 2010 for Beginners) is my “virgin manual”, yet all he talks about is fucking dungeons and dragons. I have pretty much lost all my friends, now they’re all acquaintances because we don’t have much in common any more.</p>
<p>Just thought I’d let out what all has been going on in my mind.[/quote]<br>

Anyway…</p>

              <p>Memes recently started blowing up on facebook for me too. At first, me and 5 friends were doing a joke by making our profile the “me gusta” face, and commenting that on literally everyone’s status, and then I see other people doing “y u no” and “forever alone”. Shit pisses me off.</p>

<p>Rant 2: I can agree with and we don’t have that much in our school mostly because we have three-four Administrators. Thus we being like a strict school, and about 99.9% of the students listen and follow the Rules. Ever since we had a merge, our school has been a little down therefore now being 99.9%. So, we don’t deal with that much at our school.</p>

              <p>Feel free to join in though.</p>
<p>Rant 1: I really hate how certain people (that I know in real life) use memes and post really old shit that really isn’t funny anymore, and everyone else joins in with them and then infest facebook with all sorts of newfaggotry. Everyone will comment saying “OMG that’s so funny!”, etc., and the poster’s popularity level jumps. I don’t know why but it just really pisses me off to see people using memes on facebook and in real life. On other websites, I’d be fine.</p>
<p>Rant 2: I opened my eyes a little wider and looked around and saw how much bullying is going on in my school. Seriously, the amount is amazing. I saw three people getting put in headlocks and getting called names when I was walking down the hall to my class. Shits fucked up. I myself get bullied by a few people. It was way worse in middle school. I almost got my neck broken because one kid was forcing my head onto my desk and my neck was bending to the right and it was sore for the next week or so. I also remember how people would pull out my hair because I’ve got long hair. Although I guess it’s probably worse in high school now: One bully takes my papers and just crumples them up and slobbers all over them right in front of the teacher (sits in the front row, she sees it all the time, never does shit about it), he also throws any writing utensils I have away, and punches me, slaps me, knees me, etc. Other times with other bullies I just get put into headlocks to the point where I swear I’m going to die this time, or I get punched and slapped.</p>
<p>Rant 3: One of my closest friends has become an extreme dick over the past few weeks. He plays DnD and always just sits around eating food, playing computer games, etc., and yet he tells me that because I’m a programmer, I’m going to be forever alone, will never get laid (even though he too is a virgin), the book I’m reading (Visual C++ 2010 for Beginners) is my “virgin manual”, yet all he talks about is fucking dungeons and dragons. I have pretty much lost all my friends, now they’re all acquaintances because we don’t have much in common any more.</p>
<p>Just thought I’d let out what all has been going on in my mind.</p>
