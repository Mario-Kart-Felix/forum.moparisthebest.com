    <title>Community &quot;RsDemon&quot; Investigation (Client Included and Pictures)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/community-rsdemon-investigation-client-included-and-pictures/153381</link>
    <description>I have currently started glancing through Chinese articles and/or forums for more information leading to who is developing and supporting the Chinese-based bot. Further findings will be updated within this topic, as well as further community findings leading to interesting subjects or conclusions.


[ul][*]Do not bring external arguments that do not have to do with the discussion of the Chinese Bot &quot;RSdemon&quot; into this thread. Off-topic argumentative discussions are a waste of precious investigative time, and will not be tolerated.
[*]Do not disregard detrimental findings.

              <p>[quote=“frank_, post:8, topic:153381”]is this shit still around?[/quote] 50% of Runescape f2p’s population at daytime and 70-80% of nighttime f2p’s servers are filled with bots. I would happily assist you in a shocking tour through Draynor/Lumbridge/Port Sarim and all you will see around you are bots, 1000’s of them, on all f2p-world. The scope of this bot is amazing. It is far worse then back in the aryan days.  And yes there have been many investigations in the past. It might be usefull as part of your investigation Crack Miners, to provide with a survey of previous findings of the “clientless” bot.</p>

<p>Its just the chinese language is hard to translate, or maybe the websites that are build around this thing allow chinese “internets” only? Sounds interesting though. I don’t understand why its called RSdemon, but the rest is in chinese. It should be like RSnihao?</p>
