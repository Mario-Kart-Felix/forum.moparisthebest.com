    <description>Hey,

Im having problems putting my server online.

I have got my source and client and i have changed the ip number of times to 127.0.0.0 and 0.0.0.1.

i have no-ip duc downloaded with all three ticks which means everything is ok.

I have my no-ip ip which i made,

i have portforward my server and it works ok.

So i went to rsps and made a webclient the status says its online but when i try and others try to connect is says

no response from the server try using a different world.

http://prntscr.com/2sj4z

btw i have check and there are no banned accounts no bans no ip bans and no host bans.

i have tried the ip 127.0.0.0 and 0.0.0.1 and it still says the same thing. 

Please help will rep ++ on other account.

              <p>127.0.0.1 and 0.0.0.0 are to connect to your own computer. Meaning that if you are hosting your server on your computer, then you must set the ip at that ip. If your friends try to connect tthen set the <em>.no-ip.</em> and it should work.</p>
