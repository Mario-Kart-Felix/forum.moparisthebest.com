    <title>Control Panel</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/control-panel/371943</link>
    <description>Welcome to my Server Development thread, in here I will be developing a new control panel with a decent amount of needed features for a server owner, Ive come up with a few ideas already, but I will need some more from you guys. This will be developed to work on a WinterLove 317 based server (I will most likely make more versions for other revisions and bases).

Key Ideas:


[ul][li]Support for a player list.[/li]
[li]Ban, Mute, Kick, etc, etc...[/li]
[li]Support for use out side of the local computer, meaning you can control your server from a computer across town, or out of the state, or out of the country and what not.[/li]
[li]No non needed features that over size it, like NPC and Item lists, or buttons to spawn shit, because that stuff is just un-needed.[/li]
[li]Buttons for things like restarting the server, restarting NPC&#39;s or Updating the server.[/li]
[li]a Command Prompt, to use instead of having to have 2 open for things like debugging messages, or other messages you want sent to the CMD.[/li][/ul]


Not all the things I listed will get in, but I am hoping to create a new control panel as I don&#39;t really like the one Roger released, It&#39;s to heavy in terns of un-needed shit, and plus I would like to learn more on creating GUI&#39;s and how to use those packages.</description>

<p>I’ll try to have a picture or two this week maybe Friday… I am still figuring the package out and how to use it… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>[quote=“I Vain I”]I suggest adding multiple panes, for things such as debugging, players, npcs, etc.</p>
<p>Debugging for switching an integer in the server, so you can enable / disable commands, drops, shops, trading, talking, action buttons, etc.</p>
<p>Players for handling all the player information, such as change passwords, kick, ban, demote, promote, jail, perform actions such as force chat, gfx, emote, teleports, etc.</p>
<p>NPCs to handle the npcs, such as drops, (if you take the time to allow drops to be configured through the control panel), text, actions, (making the npc talk/teleport), and other stuff.</p>
<p>Also, I would suggest using a ‘variable/constant’ class to hold all the variables, so it will be easy to configure through out bases.</p>
<p>Such as, when coding in action events, you can make the event load from CONSTANT_CLASS.EVENT_NAME_TO_LOAD. etc.</p>
<p>Then, have the class be configured to locate that method.</p>
<p>Such as PI’s bank method would be c.getPA().openUpBank(); but it could be triggered by, let’s say Config, Confg.bank();</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public void bank() {
    dir = "c.getPA().openUpBank();";
}</code></pre>
<p>I probably had multiple errors, but that’s a general idea.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks or the ideas, but as I already said this won’t be created with the intention of helping further a persons server development, it will be made strictly for watching over the server.</p>

<p>Thanks for the idea. But I will most likely not add support for things like that, this will be made for, keeping the server clean, rebooting the server, updating the server (restarts blah blah blah, etc, etc, etc…</p>

Why is it pointless?  Are you satisfied yet?  You’re looking like a complete, arrogant little pick, while also seeming like one of the most clueless trolls on the internet.  It’s obviously not just a simple JFrame created with Netbeans.  It also would be a useful tool to use.  Hypothetically speaking, if this were created, I would want to put a non-playable character somewhere in the server, and then updating, and if I had happened to obtain this tool, all I’d have to do is maximize my server control panel, type in the ID of the NPC, the X and Y coordinates, and press “Update”.

<p>Yeah, I will add a tab or section for the CMD to be placed, instead of having to have both open at the same time.</p>

              <p>This sounds really nice, so the ‘Command Prompt,’ as you said, when you run the server, it will automatically open up the control panel [of course] but the server prompt, that looks like the cmd, will be in a separate tab?<br>
Was that what you meant; if so, that’s very nice.</p>

              <p>Welcome to my Server Development thread, in here I will be developing a new control panel with a decent amount of needed features for a server owner, Ive come up with a few ideas already, but I will need some more from you guys. This will be developed to work on a WinterLove 317 based server (I will most likely make more versions for other revisions and bases).</p>
<p>Key Ideas:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Support for a player list.[/li]<br>
[li]Ban, Mute, Kick, etc, etc…[/li]<br>
[li]Support for use out side of the local computer, meaning you can control your server from a computer across town, or out of the state, or out of the country and what not.[/li]<br>
[li]No non needed features that over size it, like NPC and Item lists, or buttons to spawn shit, because that stuff is just un-needed.[/li]<br>
[li]Buttons for things like restarting the server, restarting NPC’s or Updating the server.[/li]<br>
[li]a Command Prompt, to use instead of having to have 2 open for things like debugging messages, or other messages you want sent to the CMD.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Not all the things I listed will get in, but I am hoping to create a new control panel as I don’t really like the one Roger released, It’s to heavy in terns of un-needed shit, and plus I would like to learn more on creating GUI’s and how to use those packages.</p>
