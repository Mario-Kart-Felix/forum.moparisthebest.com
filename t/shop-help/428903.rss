    <description>Okay, I am trying to modify my slayer point store, i realize how to edit/change the items, but what i don&#39;t understand is how to edit the shop so you can modify the amount of slayer points it costs to buy an item. Any one who could help, it would be much, much appreciated. Thanks ! :)

Note: I have just begun to code, so please bare with me, I&#39;m trying to learn as fast as possible.</description>
