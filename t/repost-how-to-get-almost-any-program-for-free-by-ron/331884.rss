    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/repost-how-to-get-almost-any-program-for-free-by-ron/331884</link>
    <description>This thread was deleted sometime ago for reasons I do not know. I found it to be extremely helpful, and wished to repost it. I found it quoted in a thread and was elated, so I&#39;ve reposted it down here for your enjoyment. I did edit it though to be more current. All credits go to Ron, the original creator.

[center][b][size=20pt]How to get almost any program for FREE![/size][/b]
by Ron[/center]

[b]-&gt; Just the Basics[/b]
I&#39;m sure a lot of you know this, but even more of you don&#39;t know about it. It&#39;s called torrents. Torrents are files that let you download an exact match of the file you&#39;re looking for from other people. Just like on KaZaA or something, but only EXACT ones will appear, so if anyone embedded any viruses, then you wouldn&#39;t see that seeder. A seeder is someone who has the file and one you can download from.

[url=http://www.utorrent.com/]Download uTorrent[/url]. Install it, and get your butt back here. Also, I know there are different programs for downloading torrents, but uTorrent is so easy and very small in size, that it&#39;s perfect. It is simply the best torrent client for Windows

You got the program, now you need torrents. Where do you get torrents? Well there are many websites out there that carry them, but you only want to go to one, because 90% of the other websites that have torrents are infested with spyware and other junk, but feel free to try them by searching on google for torrents or whatever.

The website you want to get torrents from is called [url=http://www.isohunt.com]ISOHunt[/url] or you could check out [url=http://www.thepiratebay.org/]ThePirateBay.org[/url] and also [url=http://www.demonoid.com]Demonoid.com[/url] is very good. Just search for whatever you like such as photoshop, flash, etcetera. You will find it. When you download the torrent, make sure it has a lot of seeders so you can actually download it. BitTorrent is just like a P2P app, except torrents are much cleaner than individual files that you would get from KaZaA or Limewire.

[b]-&gt; Set up BitTorrent 4.20.4[/b]

[ul][*] Open up BitTorrent and go to View &gt; Settings
[*] On the General Tab, I checked the first two and the fifth checkboxes. 
[*] On the Saving Tab, for the &quot;Move Completed Downloads to&quot; browse to a spot where you can store your torrents. Mine is C:\Ron\Torrents. If you&#39;re paranoid that your parents may find out, then make sure to hide where you keep your torrents by making a folder like... C:\Windows\Important Documents. And for the &quot;Store Unfinished Downloads In&quot;, just leave it the way it is.
[*] On the Network Tab, it should be set to &quot;Autodetect available bandwidth&quot; and for the &quot;Look for an available port&quot; just pick a random number from 1024-65535 and leave &quot;Enable automatic port mapping (UPnP)&quot; checked.
[*] On the Appearance Tab, it&#39;s confusing for me to see the bits and pieces instead of an Ordinary Progress Bar. On the Toolbar Style, I checked &quot;Show Text&quot; and chose Small for the Icon Size.
[*] On the Language Tab, just pick whatever language you&#39;re most comfortable with. :)[/ul]


[b]EDIT: See http://www.utorrent.com/documentation/connection-setup for configuring uTorrent[/b]

WARNING! The torrents are [u]not always[/u] clean and/or spyware free. Just be careful, and try to read people&#39;s reviews, and see what they say. Normally the first poster will say if it worked or if its clean or not. Check what the others said to be absolutely sure.

WAIT! IF YOU HAVE/KNOW ANY GOOD PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE A KEY OR SOME KIND OF HACK. PLEASE UPLOAD THEM AND THEN POST IT HERE. I&#39;LL CREDIT YOU AND ADD THE PROGRAM. WE ONLY HAVE 20 SOMETHING PROGRAMS!! WE NEED MORE!!!! Greed...  :rolleyes:

[b]-&gt; Programs Predownloaded just for you :) Update 3/6/2010: Not all links work anymore[/b]
Some files are from torrents from [url=http://www.torrentspy.com]TorrentSpy.com[/url] and some are serials from [url=http://www.serials.ws]Serials.ws[/url] (which is spyware infected and it&#39;s recommended that you [u]do not[/u] go there). For each program, just follow the instructions to install it properly. Most of the time, the install information is in the below files.

If you just want a simple CD/DVD burner/ripper then just use Windows Media Player. Simple is so much better than the latest and newest thing. But hey, if you need the extra features Nero supplies, then download it and have fun. :)

Wicked cute too. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Anyway, the reason my original thread was locked or removed was because this forum decided not to link to anything illegal including warez and hacks. So I had to abandon it.</p>
<p>If you want to expand on this thread, before it gets locked, just teach people how to torrent by writing a tutorial for the current version of the clients. uTorrent, Transmission, Deluge, Yet ABC (Another BitTorrent Client)</p>
<p>My personal favorite would be Transmission. I used to use uTorrent but decided I needed something a little bit more free/open so I went with Transmission.</p>

              <p>This thread was deleted sometime ago for reasons I do not know. I found it to be extremely helpful, and wished to repost it. I found it quoted in a thread and was elated, so I’ve reposted it down here for your enjoyment. I did edit it though to be more current. All credits go to Ron, the original creator.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">[size=20pt]How to get almost any program for FREE![/size]</span><br>
by Ron[/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Just the Basics</span><br>
I’m sure a lot of you know this, but even more of you don’t know about it. It’s called torrents. Torrents are files that let you download an exact match of the file you’re looking for from other people. Just like on KaZaA or something, but only EXACT ones will appear, so if anyone embedded any viruses, then you wouldn’t see that seeder. A seeder is someone who has the file and one you can download from.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Download uTorrent</a>. Install it, and get your butt back here. Also, I know there are different programs for downloading torrents, but uTorrent is so easy and very small in size, that it’s perfect. It is simply the best torrent client for Windows</p>
<p>You got the program, now you need torrents. Where do you get torrents? Well there are many websites out there that carry them, but you only want to go to one, because 90% of the other websites that have torrents are infested with spyware and other junk, but feel free to try them by searching on google for torrents or whatever.</p>
<p>The website you want to get torrents from is called <a href="http://www.isohunt.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ISOHunt</a> or you could check out <a href="http://www.thepiratebay.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">ThePirateBay.org</a> and also <a href="http://www.demonoid.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Demonoid.com</a> is very good. Just search for whatever you like such as photoshop, flash, etcetera. You will find it. When you download the torrent, make sure it has a lot of seeders so you can actually download it. BitTorrent is just like a P2P app, except torrents are much cleaner than individual files that you would get from KaZaA or Limewire.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">-&gt; Set up BitTorrent 4.20.4</span></p>
<p>[ul][<em>] Open up BitTorrent and go to View &gt; Settings<br>
[</em>] On the General Tab, I checked the first two and the fifth checkboxes.<br>
[<em>] On the Saving Tab, for the “Move Completed Downloads to” browse to a spot where you can store your torrents. Mine is C:\Ron\Torrents. If you’re paranoid that your parents may find out, then make sure to hide where you keep your torrents by making a folder like… C:\Windows\Important Documents. And for the “Store Unfinished Downloads In”, just leave it the way it is.<br>
[</em>] On the Network Tab, it should be set to “Autodetect available bandwidth” and for the “Look for an available port” just pick a random number from 1024-65535 and leave “Enable automatic port mapping (UPnP)” checked.<br>
[<em>] On the Appearance Tab, it’s confusing for me to see the bits and pieces instead of an Ordinary Progress Bar. On the Toolbar Style, I checked “Show Text” and chose Small for the Icon Size.<br>
[</em>] On the Language Tab, just pick whatever language you’re most comfortable with. :)[/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EDIT: See <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/documentation/connection-setup" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.utorrent.com/documentation/connection-setup</a> for configuring uTorrent</span></p>
<p>WARNING! The torrents are <span class="bbcode-u">not always</span> clean and/or spyware free. Just be careful, and try to read people’s reviews, and see what they say. Normally the first poster will say if it worked or if its clean or not. Check what the others said to be absolutely sure.</p>
<p>WAIT! IF YOU HAVE/KNOW ANY GOOD PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE A KEY OR SOME KIND OF HACK. PLEASE UPLOAD THEM AND THEN POST IT HERE. I’LL CREDIT YOU AND ADD THE PROGRAM. WE ONLY HAVE 20 SOMETHING PROGRAMS!! WE NEED MORE!!! Greed…  :rolleyes:</p>

<li>Download the try out version from <a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/software/cdr_software/cdr_applications/nero.cfm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li>Download this crack from <a href="http://www.uploading.com/?get=EVFVRII9" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</li>
<li>This is a good program, but it installs a lot of junk on your computer. Not bad stuff or anything, just Nero went too far and went too beyond you know? If you just want a simple CD/DVD burner/ripper then just use Windows Media Player. Simple is so much better than the latest and newest thing. But hey, if you need the extra features Nero supplies, then download it and have fun. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
