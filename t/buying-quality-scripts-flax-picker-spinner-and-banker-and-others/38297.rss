    <description>I&#39;ve come to the realization that I just can&#39;t get the hang of Scripting, So for now, I&#39;m going to leave it up to the many other talented individuals here...I have a few ideas I would like to work on someone with, but here is some basic ones that I am looking for right now, that I&#39;m pretty sure are out there....these will be for my own private use and not for resale, Please either post here with prices or email me at RAM_RUNE@hotmail.com, Also, if it is a very reliable and original script, I may be interested in giving portions of the materials I gather.....Thanks [b]RAM[/b]
