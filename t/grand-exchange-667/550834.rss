    <description>I have it where u can buy items in the ge but it automatically sells it regaurdless if anyone has made an offer.  I would much rather take that interface and make it into player owned shops, but I&#39;m not sure how, or perhaps even fix the problem as to why it wont let me sell anything, but allows me to buy everything.</description>

              <p>So basically, if you don’t know what the problem is don’t post here.  Gotcha, makes sense except for the part about this being a help section.  So if you know what the problem is why would you need help.  Obviously, I don’t know where the problem is or I wouldn’t be asking for help.  Help is requested not demanded remember that.  Also, if you have nothing nice to say don’t say anything at all.  I guess what your saying is unless you know the exact line or lines of code that are giving you the problem then don’t ask for help.</p>

              <p>So. What do you want us to do here?</p>
<p>You didn’t really supply… anything.</p>
<p>Take a look at the section rules again. Specifically, rules 2 and 3.</p>
