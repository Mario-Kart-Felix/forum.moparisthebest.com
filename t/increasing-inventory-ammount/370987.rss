    <title>Increasing Inventory ammount</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/increasing-inventory-ammount/370987</link>
    <description>I know its possible to do, because a good friend of mine (Java professional) helped me do it.

hes long gone havent talked to him in years  :(


anyways, it had something to do with looking in Class30_Sub2_Sub1 or something like that, and finding a thing that said something like

inventory=( 7     x     4     =     28
and chaning those numbers, and then doing somethign server sided.

I know a decent ammount about java and am looking for some help. thanks</description>
