    <title>A letter of assignment, to Mod Ice!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-letter-of-assignment-to-mod-ice/41839</link>
    <description>Hi, it&#39;s me Jump On Java, i&#39;m only back for about 5 minutes, and i will be leaving. During the last month or so, Me, Mod Ice and BillySmither was working on Player Owned Houses. BillySmither left. We had an agreement that if the group split up it would go to the person who wasn&#39;t leaving. It was Mod Ice. I&#39;m leaving MoparScape because i have exams coming up and i&#39;ve got an assignment to work at Java. I&#39;m really pleased for all the other MoparScape coders out there. I hope you get to work at Java.

I promote Mod Ice with the rights to Player Owned Houses.

Farewell !

All my wishes to you.

-Jump On Java  :|  :)

P.S Oops, oh yes and Player Owned Houses will be started again from version 1.</description>
