    <title>How to remove lumby castle doors?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-remove-lumby-castle-doors/452730</link>
    <description>I made new bank booths and items inside the Lumby Castle on my 317 cammy pvp source.
There were no doors there before when i made the objects, after making the objects all the doors reappeared and i cant go through them.
Can someone help me remove the doors so i can move out of the area I am in, and i need them removed for my server so people can walk in and out. I just need detail to do it, thanks!

Thanks :)</description>
