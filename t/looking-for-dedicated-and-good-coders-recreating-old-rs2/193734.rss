Hey guys. I need very dedicated and good coders to do this. I need you guys to help me to recreate old RS2 (Like last summer?) 100% or close to that :D
Like, all npcs (almost), all items (almost) 100% wilderness (100%!), all the ladders etc working, prayer recharing at altars, prayers working and etc...
Like I said this is not going to be a little project, it is goign to be very hard, time consuming and boring project. But it is very rewarding, if we get it working good. 
If you want to apply, please fill this:
