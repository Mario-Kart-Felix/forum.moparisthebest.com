Now, before I start I want to state that yes; I am the first to oppose change. If something works, don&amp;#39;t change it. If it isn&amp;#39;t broken, why fix it? I know, I know. However, I believe it&amp;#39;s time MoparScape had &amp;hellip;">

<p>Its like there are 20/50 <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Users</span></span> and the rest are guest…<br>
I remember the General Disccusion used to realy realy bisy, same with the server downloads page those threads were bumped all the time.<br>
Now i’ve the feeling there is almost no new threads, or any changes in threads, its like nothing is realy active anymore.</p>

        <p>First of all I’d like to say thanks to jme for stating that, and I agree heavily with him. If 1 person stands up and unites enough people who are knowledgeable and work hard then I know for a fact we can restore ourselves to our former glory and become even better than we used to be. It only takes one person to change the minds of thousands. Not saying that that’s what’s going to happen, just saying that it could.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/kidpaparoach-2.html">@Kidpaparoach</a>, I know that major changes must occur for a big reaction to take place but that’s not going to happen right now. Major changes aren’t always good. I’m not looking for a big reaction, I’m looking for something over time. If what I’m doing even brings in ten new members then it’s a success, it still fulfilled its duty. <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparisthebest.com/moparisthebest.com</a> and <a href="http://moparcraft.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparcraft.net</a> all have remained payment free so far and we’ve built this much of a user-base. IF we were to enable  payments I think it would see a rise in scams and the like. If people were to be branded as verified sellers it could instigate some form of Elitism which would be terrible considering the staffs current efforts to reduce it. If you have anything besides the money idea I’d be glad to hear it!</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/supah.html">@Supah</a> Fly:<br>
I don’t think a board remodel is needed, we just restored the forums to their former state and people will just get annoyed if we go changing them at this time. I also like the current layout and don’t think it needs changing. However, I’d love to see your concepts on the databases and how you’d lay them out and create the converter and what not. PM me, add me on skype, contact me on the IRC or whatever, just get in contact :P.</p>

        <p>I’m not saying a big change will be good, I’m saying it can be good depending on what the big change is. I think what you want is the best course of action however I don’t think it’d work personally but I hope I’m proved wrong.<br>
I think I may have portrayed what the sales could be in the wrong way, for example it would be nothing like Rune-Server.<br>
For example, a system similar to Playerauctions system for buying selling gp but with programming ‘shizz’ and the only sellers of these services would be verified people for example David has programming knowledge and does seem trustworthy so he could be one of those people. This would make sure only people that can provide a high quality service make a profit as-well as moparscape itself makes a profit. This would also incentivise people to get good at programming don’t you think if their was a cash insentive? Of course this idea is flawed but its a rough idea I just came up with right now although it could work (with more precise detailing of course).<br>
Their would always be the normal free normal services we have at the moment, the paid would just be a bonus if you have the cash.<br>
We already have a crazy amount of elitism, but maybe we think of elitism in different ways. I do have other ideas but I doubt they’d get very far due to a differ in opinions between me and people in power.</p>

        <p>There’s no-one in power here making decisions, I’m not in any form of power, I’m not to say what’s to go ahead, this is a community decision and if more people than not think it beneficial I’d happily propose it. If it’s a good idea we could convince the administrators that it’s useful :). Just share everything that comes to your mind!</p>
<p>I don’t think the payments idea is good though, as I said, it goes against everything that we were founded on and just doesn’t agree with me to be honest. That’s just me though, there are other people here!</p>

I don’t think a board remodel is needed, we just restored the forums to their former state and people will just get annoyed if we go changing them at this time. I also like the current layout and don’t think it needs changing. However, I’d love to see your concepts on the databases and how you’d lay them out and create the converter and what not. PM me, add me on skype, contact me on the IRC or whatever, just get in contact :P.[/quote]</p>
<p>while i understand that people dislike change, it’s not about removing anything. it’s about just more clearly defining where content goes and adding boards that need to be added (like the concepts, theories, information, etc. board). like i said, fragmentation makes it just a mess for people that actually want to learn to find information since it’s not all centralized. if you’re afraid of people reacting negatively to positive changes then you’re always going to remain stagnant. i think that changes need to stick for a few months and then if people really don’t like it then you should change it back. it’s important to get people’s feedback and ask them to try and look at it objectively and see if they think that it’s either an improvement or not. then you refine it and make it to what it should be.</p>
<p>i used to admin/own a pretty old/large rs cheating site back in the day and i know how people react to change and how to go about making changes in a way that isn’t disruptive. i get it. i think the layout needs changing, it doesn’t really need to be fixed as much as it does need to be refined. dead projects, etc. need to be moved to an archive. in the download section, things need to be moved to an archive if they’re dead. it’s so frustrating to not know if links are dead or not. the help section could be improved by having resolved, open, etc. tags. there’s so many small tweaks you could make to make the forums a much better experience. as humans, we should always be looking to improve ourselves and our environments. the same should go for mopar. it’s alright the way it is now but don’t you want to make it better? where’s the fun in being stagnant? it doesn’t have to change all at once, just one little tweak here and another there over a considerable amount of time so people can warm up to the ideas and be more open to the change because they have more control of what the end result will be.</p>

        <p>I agree completely to what you’re saying, I understand that change must take place and that if the change is beneficial then people must adapt. I totally agree that this is true but I don’t see the use of archive boards for downloads and the like, sometimes those dead threads could be revived and people often do that. I like the tag ideas though, those could be put into place. That’d involve hard-coding them to our forum though and our forum is already incredibly highly modified which could cause real problems for something like that.</p>
<p>It’s the same as the entire site, it’s not as if it needs to be changed, just refined to nothing less than perfection.</p>

<p>I’m not sure, but it should be something that can involve the whole community without the need for trust issues. Everyone pitching in to work on an open-source game would be good. We have enough web designers, graphic designers, 3D modellers and programmers to ensure that the team would work. We could have it governed by a small group of people who approve/deny/assign suggestions and also manage a GitHub repo. The game would be open-source so leaking wouldn’t be a problem, content would be decided on by a select few so that wouldn’t cause any issues and the submitted code would be reviewed to prevent any maliciousness.</p>
<h1>Also, to avoid anyone being tied down, the “assignment” part of suggestions should be more like:<br>
governor: “here’s the plan: hdsfjheuhfiee, who wants to do this?”<br>
person 1: “I’ll do it”</h1>
<h1>person 1: “Here’s what I’ve done so far, I’m stuck/have other commitments/can’t be bothered”<br>
governor: “okay thanks”</h1>
<p>"governor: “here’s the plan: iehjiufheuhrfe, here is person 1’s work, who wants to do this?”<br>
person 2: “I’ll do it”</p>
<p>That would prevent any issues</p>

No just that, I can’t see it bringing any benefits to the forums as a whole. It would just cause problems I think.[/quote]</p>
<p>Pretty much this ^.</p>
<p>Although I do enjoy doing rsps services, because it’s fun and easy money for ME. It causes so many problems over at R-S. The only benefit would be people on R-S that do these services would become more active over here.</p>
<p>The cost out ways the benefits on this one.</p>

<p>I think that getting told your work is “rubbish” is beneficial. There’s a line and whilst some members cross it, the majority stick to it. Getting told your work is “rubbish” doesn’t mean that what you’ve done is terrible etc, it’s just a strong way of ensuring that you don’t carry on doing what you’re doing, and move on to another way.</p>
