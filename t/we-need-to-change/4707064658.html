Now, before I start I want to state that yes; I am the first to oppose change. If something works, don&amp;#39;t change it. If it isn&amp;#39;t broken, why fix it? I know, I know. However, I believe it&amp;#39;s time MoparScape had &amp;hellip;">

        <p>I agree.</p>
<p>Tom has been asking for a server status page for minecraft for a long time, it’s just the fact the nobody with the skills has the time and people with the time don’t have the skills. I dont think our theme needs changing but I do think we need more content, like ID databases etc. MITB is the only person with the access rights to add things like that though, at least that’s what I’ve been led to believe.</p>

Yeah I was just speaking to Tom there and he explained a lot of it to me. MoparCraft really needs some attention from the administration since the launch of MineLocus.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Rix_, post:1, topic:470766”]Just to set things off, Moparisthebest hates social networking. I won’t expect any feature related to social networking to be introduced here, that includes something as trivial as “likes”. Anyway, I think the forums have had a fair share of changes, all of which wouldn’t have been possible without Taharok’s promotion. Unless you’re not recognising Taharok’s efforts to raise forum activity as ‘change’, then I have nothing to say. I have to admit that some of his efforts were short-sighted though.</p>
<p>The website can be revamped but that’s not going to attract anyone. What can MoparScape offer that other communities may already have? You’ve suggested many ideas to beautify the website so why not work on a prototype? Push for its implementation when you have completed it, that will make things faster. You have the web developer award, couldn’t you do it? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I feel that the only time MoparScape can grow is when another major community dies. Only then will it open up the golden opportunity for MoparScape to re-centralise RS2 emulation. That has been the community’s primary objective but it’s too bad most of the members (including me) who stay on no longer do that. Then again, what does MoparScape offer? A bunch of high horse-riders who shit on the newbies who accidentally post in the wrong section? A set of changes unrelated to RS2 emulation to be rolled out just to (dis)please the members? MoparScape no longer offers anything. The client is a thing of the past while the official server… what’s going on with it?</p>
<p>I probably made little sense thus far so I’ll end it here. Things won’t change, it’ll take more than a miracle.[/quote]<br>
No, I am recognising Taharoks efforts and him doing work, that’s why I said I wasn’t getting at anyone in particular. This wasn’t originally aimed towards staff, I had aimed this towards a community team. Rune-Locus have a community team and it’s working wonders for them, if they can do it, we can do it.</p>
<p>I actually was going to start working on a site and promoting it through and through, I just wanted to see if anyone else was willing to work beside me and share my views on it or more or less a community team. I’ll start work on the site today and it should be finished before tomorrow, depending on if I start on this dissertation or not.</p>
<p>I know that our primary function is to instruct others on RS2 Emulation but we’re losing the new players that are coming towards communities primarily for that. They’re joining the other two and a lot of the time they base their first opinions on the visual aspect. If it isn’t visually appealing they’ll head elsewhere.</p>
<p>As I said, I’ll focus on a site and push for it to be put to use.</p>

        <p>Hey kids. Dey see me lurkin’</p>
<p>Where do we start? First of all, noting on this site is ever updated. If you notice, R-S and RL constantly have updates rolling. They keep their community informed and motivated. One of the main things on RS is it’s easy to spot members that are well respected. Round here it seems they give awards to any hillbilly.</p>
<p>The general theme of the forum is poor. Grey seems depressing. Unwilling to change. Unmotivating. As soon as i came back here, i felt the pit of dispair grow inside of me. Realistically, what’s changed since 2010? Nothing.<br>
There are no servers. What ever happened to MSCP’s/MITB’s CSS server? Gaming servers kept the community motivated. It gave us something to do. Someone to chat to. Someone who we can relate to in game and create a minor bond with<br>
Mods be shit. Seriously, you’re all so tight on some things, such as trolling, but then some kids posts in the wrong section like 10 times and no action is taken. Also, when was the last time an actual mod was appointed? Seems everyone is the same. Are there even section mods?<br>
The sections aren’t broken down enough in fine detail. You get shit posts and tutorials because people don’t know where to post or what to post. Why don’t you do the approve post thing again but have a bigger team instead of 2 people laughing like bloody Aladdin in the corner playing god and deciding what to let through.</p>
<p>Also. Get rid of this swear filter.</p>
<p>Eh. Life.</p>

        <p>Towards the badge comment there’s only been a very, very small amount of badges handed out on MSCP and even smaller amount of those were programming related. I don’t believe the forums theme is an issue, what is the main colour in R-S’s theme selection? Black.</p>
<p>Towards the staff comment, there are 2 sectional moderators and a team of around 15 (i think) moderators working throughout all the boards. There was a promotion last month and then two months before that there was another few promotions. It isn’t the moderators that are effecting the growth of the community. However, I do agree on the point that we haven’t changed in a while.</p>
<p>The boards being on a wider topic actually should benefit posting and not restrict it as you’re saying.</p>

<p>Exactly my point, their forum theme main color is Black. It’s also a colour that won’t initiate any kind of motivation. Shoutboxes are just a complete pain, we have an IRC channel for that if people want it. If you want to get in contact with members then post etc.</p>
<p>Chassy resigned if I remember correctly. However, I don’t agree that inactivity should be a criteria for demotion. There are times in peoples lives where they must grow inactive for a while. The mods we currently have are fully supportive, for the most part active and more than likely nice. Just because the posts are made in a board with a wider variety of allowed topics doesn’t mean that there’s more locks or anything along those lines, it is what it is. I don’t think that means there’s more locks, a high amount of locked topics is normal on an online forum.</p>

No it isn’t bullshit. I’ve never seen you in there once so it doesn’t seem like you’ve got the rights to call bullshit on something you know nothing about. As I said before, there’s been a lot of hard-coded modification done to these forums to make them work in the way they do so it’s a lot of work to get an installed theme to work. The only way we could be sure that another theme would work would be to build on top of current themes which administrators don’t have time to do and I doubt they’d be willing to give me the permission to do it.</p>

        <p>I’ll do what I do to all of these threads and give a few bulletpoints to respond to most of what I see here…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Forum theme. Moparisthebest supports the addition of new forum themes. However, he wants to wait until we upgrade forum software to work on it. The best people can do right now is look for new themes and keep them in mind for when it happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ID Lists. I think this is actually a good idea. I like the idea of MoparScape being less of a ‘forum and client and SSP’ and more of an overall development place, so people don’t have to go looking around to find what they need. We use boards to redirect to a lot of our content, which doesn’t make sense to me. There should be another button line (apart from the forum one with PM, search, etc on it) that has buttons for all of our different things like the wiki, chat, and SSP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chat. We’ve talked about this before. I think the consensus was a client MAY go on the index, but be hidden by default. If not, there would be an easy to find link for it. (IRC Chat is confusing for a lot of people)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staff. Unfortunantly cows has NO idea what he’s talking about. Just because people can’t always see actions that get taken doesn’t mean they don’t get handled, especially with moving threads. As for change, none of us are against change. Us being against change and the changes actually taking place are two completely different things.

<p>[quote=“the elve age, post:2, topic:470706”]Every single change, tiny or large has to be approved basically with the entire staff team and the staff section isn’t very active so ideas get stalled and thrown under the carpet.[/quote]Them being stalled isn’t about it not being active, it’s because of <span class="hashtag">#4</span></p>

<li>Forum theme. Moparisthebest supports the addition of new forum themes. However, he wants to wait until we upgrade forum software to work on it. The best people can do right now is look for new themes and keep them in mind for when it happens.[/quote]</li>

<p>2. ID Lists. I think this is actually a good idea. I like the idea of MoparScape being less of a ‘forum and client and SSP’ and more of an overall development place, so people don’t have to go looking around to find what they need. We use boards to redirect to a lot of our content, which doesn’t make sense to me. There should be another button line (apart from the forum one with PM, search, etc on it) that has buttons for all of our different things like the wiki, chat, and SSP.</p>

<p>4. Staff. Unfortunantly cows has NO idea what he’s talking about. Just because people can’t always see actions that get taken doesn’t mean they don’t get handled, especially with moving threads. As for change, none of us are against change. Us being against change and the changes actually taking place are two completely different things.

<p>For god sake David. I remember the days when you were a normal member like me and all the time you were bloody piping up about how crap thread handling was and how mods weren’t making the best choices and how there weren’t enough of you. I’m not saying people don’t have lives, i’m saying if nobody ever does anything, more people are required for the job.</p>

        <p>Why don’t people focus on their programming, skills, servers… Instead of whining about a message board. It’s really not that injust here.</p>
<p>We are a simple and clean message board and a good alternative to the other messy forums. Shout boxes and new themes won’t bring the members that we want, as developers could care less about a shout box or fancy images all over. Feel free to suggest themes for later, given enough popularity they will be added. We used to have several themes.</p>
<p>There are a lot of active staff, we definitely don’t need more right now, but we add them when we have good candidates. We probably have the most level-headed “staff” in the rsps scene. Cows brought up chassy, he was one of the most active mods until he became inactive and resigned. But even if he was so inactive, it doesn’t matter. We don’t have limited spots. He wasn’t taking a spot from someone else potentially more active.</p>
<p>In the rs-cheating scene, no one ever whined about this stuff. Forget shout boxes and themes. They wanted cheats and better programming skills. The members made the community and made it great. The simple theme allowed members to focus on development instead of avatars and flashy bells/whistles. We took the same ideals when building this community, unfortunately it never worked as good. Thats why this same topic gets posted every week.</p>
<p>edit: ^thats not to down-talk anyone who wants improvements here.</p>

        <p><a class="mention" href="../../u/jme.html">@jme</a>, that’s the thing, we aren’t the RS cheating scene. I know that RS cheating pulled some younger members but not as many as the RSPS scene pulls. If a new member joins they usually see <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com</a> first, which is an incredibly unattractive page. They like something to draw them in, not something to just look at and expand their programming knowledge. Times have changed since then and I wish it was still that simple, too bad it isn’t and there’s not much we can do but change with the times if we wish to keep a strong userbase.</p>
