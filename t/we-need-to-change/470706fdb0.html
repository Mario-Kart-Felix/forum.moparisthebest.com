<p>I’m also looking for some experienced java programmers to write some tutorials for beginners looking to enter into RSPS. I’ve already asked Davidi2 and he more or less said no. I’ll ask sinisoul since he’s experienced inside the RSPS development scene and see if he can write something. I don’t know, that could be a hairy situation since he’s heavily involved in the Rune/Locus revamp.<br>
[/quote]I didn’t say no, I said if I was to write a tutorial it would have to be worth the effort. IE - something that would actually be fun/interesting for me to write, or something I know a lot of people would use (or something new). Writing tutorials for new people to get into these already bad bases doesn’t appeal to me at all.[/quote]<br>
We need o get some tutorials in featured tutorials</p>

<p>I’m also looking for some experienced java programmers to write some tutorials for beginners looking to enter into RSPS. I’ve already asked Davidi2 and he more or less said no. I’ll ask sinisoul since he’s experienced inside the RSPS development scene and see if he can write something. I don’t know, that could be a hairy situation since he’s heavily involved in the Rune/Locus revamp.<br>
[/quote]I didn’t say no, I said if I was to write a tutorial it would have to be worth the effort. IE - something that would actually be fun/interesting for me to write, or something I know a lot of people would use (or something new). Writing tutorials for new people to get into these already bad bases doesn’t appeal to me at all, sorry.</p>
<p>It appears sppt also feels like he got a short straw here! Make sure you know what we mean before you put it into a public thread :|[/quote]<br>
The way you were talking was like you had no time and said there’s no point in writing tutorials unless it’s ready to copy and paste into a server. That isn’t the case at all, we’re trying to insinuate people programming, not adding tutorial elements into an already terrible base. I would eventually want a wide library of tutorials that we can refer people to through the server help board and what not. The whole point in them being there is being used. I think that even if one person notices a difference and uses it or even just refers to it then it’s time well spent. The tutorial isn’t on something content wise in an RSPS, it’s aimed at RSPS users and developers but teaches more programming than anything else.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/sinisoul.html">@sinisoul</a>: More or less just trying to re-vamp MoparScape since the administrators are really busy and can’t do it themselves at this moment in time. I was looking for people to write tutorials for a library on the new site, was wondering if you’d be up for writing a few? Would be a great help if you were.</p>

I agree but to an extent.<br>
I personally think moparscape needs to be semi-commercialised, this would provide funding, remove a lot of the factors which affect possible negative desicion making, can provide advertisements and so on.<br>
Of course there are negative aspects of being commercial i.e. morals wont matter as much and so on but that is why I said semi.<br>
So quite simply all it needs is some people paying for a service where profits are used to upgrade the forums/incentivise staff and or members.<br>
Also, an rsps sponsor isn’t the best idea… It can give a negative image of the forum etc… It may seem like the RSPS own the site/effect desicion making as if you sponsor something you expect to gain something in return.<br>
But meh thats just my 2 cents as americans would say.<br>
[/quote]<br>
That would be going against moparscapes morals, help is free, no-one receives benefits for paying money other than the sponsored server spaces. I wouldn’t like to see that changing anyway. It’s good to have ideas though.[/quote]<br>
I’m not saying don’t help for free &gt;.&gt;. I said a service i.e. hosting files, but of course selling help from certain individuals would have a positive impact. I.e. if I want to buy help, I’ll go to rune-server and probably get some half shitty piece of code, if mopar was like your good enough to sell help you can make a thread and people paid them the work bought would be of a higher quality etc…<br>
If you don’t get something you want from here, your going to go to a different website.</p>

I understand what you’re saying but I know for a fact mitb will never sell anything on the site, whether it be archiving something or giving people a different status it won’t happen. I know that people may leave because of it but there’s not really much we can do about that. We were created on our morals and there’s no point in throwing them away now :).</p>

        <p>alright, i’m definitely not reading every post in this thread. i’ll just throw some words onto the internet and hope they resonate. please note that i’m not perfect and my ideas could probably be improved, so if you want to improve upon my idea go ahead.</p>
<p>mopar, as a rs development forum, suffers from too much fragmentation and inconsistency. i think the “rswiki” on mitb is <span class="bbcode-i">absolute</span> shit (besides the cache format, coordinate system information, ondemand, jaggrab documentation, etc.). not only that but nobody knows about it existing, which is probably because it’s not good enough to really advertise, which in turn makes it stagnant. it would benefit the site if we had a forum where people can post and have their information actually be seen for things like the protocol, formats, whatever. basically the informative threads section on rune-server but executed in a way that separates facts, concepts/theories, etc. using thread tags or something. the reason the wiki just doesn’t work is because wikis are generally just hard to maintain and write content for, especially if the userbase is used to using bbcode. learning how to use the new markup in a creative and efficient way is just too much work. if people want to have their information added or if they have a correction to the information in the main post of the thread, they can post a response and either the op or mod can make the appropriate changes. i imagine forum threads to be more accessible and enjoyable to read than wiki articles. it’s all part of the experience that way, and that’s what would actually ADD to the value of mopar. having all these separate sites and shit only takes away from the main site and fragments the experience and only makes it hard to find information that could potentially make mopar members more intelligent by allowing them (by giving them easy access) to actually learn more than tutorials and downloads so that they can write their own shit and gain a better understanding of the client and server design.</p>
<p>object/item/npc databases is a good idea but we need to do it better than the other sites, which is entirely do-able. hell, i’d love to be a part of making that a reality. i guarantee that if i were to help create the databases i could improve on the basic ideas they’ve already implemented on other sites. i’d rather contribute to mopar than make my own site. ruby, if you want to do something, i’d like to help you.</p>
<p>it seems like there’s a couple changes going on and that’s actually a good thing, it shows that the site isn’t being totally neglected.</p>
<p>also i think mopar’s server section layout sucks. changing it would probably be beneficial. i can’t see how keeping it the same would really benefit the quality of the forum in the long-run, which is why i think it should change. anything, as long as it changes. doesn’t have to be even remotely close to my idea but as long as it’s an improvement.</p>

<p>just something to benefit the section and make it easier to navigate and categorize information instead of having a clusterlove of old, dead servers and downloads with dead links. we also would need a rating system so that people can actually give ratings to servers. maybe we can have a system where we can rate specific aspects of servers and categorize them. when i knew nothing about servers and wanted to get into working on them i was just like “well what server is the best? how do i know without spending hours and hours of time that i don’t have trying to figure out what server is the best? what’s the difference between servers?” etc.</p>
<p>as for an “rsps sponsor” love no, that makes the whole site biased and partial to one server. that’s just a bad idea. funding isn’t the problem.</p>
<p>that’s all i got, sorry for the poor grammar and lack of capitalization. just kind of got a stream of consciousness thing happening in this post.</p>

<p>insulting is never constructive. you need to specify reasons for why it’s “bad” or wrong. give examples of what you would do differently and explain why. doing it this way is far more beneficial than just saying “oh your code is rubbish” and leaving it at that.</p>

I agree.</p>
<p>Tom has been asking for a server status page for minecraft for a long time, it’s just the fact the nobody with the skills has the time and people with the time don’t have the skills. I dont think our theme needs changing but I do think we need more content, like ID databases etc. MITB is the only person with the access rights to add things like that though, at least that’s what I’ve been led to believe.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/jamie.html">@Jamie</a>, I made a topic on MC about the server status page and I got a reply that it was being <span class="bbcode-i">worked on</span>(I don’t even know how loosely he used that statement)? Was that just a complete lie from Viz? lol, kinda proves the community just know jackshit that’s going on with anything</p>

Building on the moparcraft forums is a good idea and potentially lucrative. I definitely support a server status page for mc and it should be easy to make. We need to focus on moparscape too though.</p>

<p>Something should definitely be done about that. A different captcha for registering probably. I noticed about a month ago all the new members had random characters for a name (but not at the moment it seems).</p>

<p>I agree but to an extent.<br>
I personally think moparscape needs to be semi-commercialised, this would provide funding, remove a lot of the factors which affect possible negative desicion making, can provide advertisements and so on.<br>
Of course there are negative aspects of being commercial i.e. morals wont matter as much and so on but that is why I said semi.<br>
So quite simply all it needs is some people paying for a service where profits are used to upgrade the forums/incentivise staff and or members.<br>
Also, an rsps sponsor isn’t the best idea… It can give a negative image of the forum etc… It may seem like the RSPS own the site/effect desicion making as if you sponsor something you expect to gain something in return.<br>
But meh thats just my 2 cents as americans would say.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>That would be going against moparscapes morals, help is free, no-one receives benefits for paying money other than the sponsored server spaces. I wouldn’t like to see that changing anyway. It’s good to have ideas though.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I’m not saying don’t help for free &gt;.&gt;. I said a service i.e. hosting files, but of course selling help from certain individuals would have a positive impact. I.e. if I want to buy help, I’ll go to rune-server and probably get some half shitty piece of code, if mopar was like your good enough to sell help you can make a thread and people paid them the work bought would be of a higher quality etc…<br>
If you don’t get something you want from here, your going to go to a different website.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I understand what you’re saying but I know for a fact mitb will never sell anything on the site, whether it be archiving something or giving people a different status it won’t happen. I know that people may leave because of it but there’s not really much we can do about that. We were created on our morals and there’s no point in throwing them away now :).[/quote]</p>
<p>This is right, we will never allow members to sell anything here. That is how we’ve remained a scam free community since our existance. The scammer crowd has no reason to come here.</p>
<p>Anyways good luck to anyone looking to improve this place with useful tools and information. Thats all this place needs is for someone to step up. You know this site deserves better. We’re a big community with a huge history and there is a lot of potential for good here. Hard work won’t go unnoticed. And as far as I’m concerned moparscape should be the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> site for rsps, and it’s not far from reality.</p>
