    <title>Can someone give me a rundown on the history of RSPS?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-someone-give-me-a-rundown-on-the-history-of-rsps/345939</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve always been interested on the past of the development of different clients. Also can someone tell me the different Client versions and what&#39;s special about each one of them? Saw a list but I think it was incomplete.

And finally, has someone developed a fully functional 317 or &lt;508 yet? I would enjoy playing in an environment where it wasn&#39;t full of customs / fake mechanics. Basically a 317 with real physics. I know they have good working RSC PS but I&#39;ve yet to see one for RS2.

Also is there anything earlier than 317 / can I play it?
And are there any old RSC PS?

Lots of questions I know but it&#39;s a Saturday and I feel like researching / having a nostalgia moment.</description>
