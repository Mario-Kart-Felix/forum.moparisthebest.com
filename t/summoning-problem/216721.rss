    <description>ok if there is an experienced coder out there please help me. I have added everything from the tut section that it said to add for the summoning skill &quot;the rip off version&quot; but its still a good version. is there anyway some1 would let me pm or email them my client.java so you can fix it (and if your are a super uber duper nice guy you can show me how to change max skill levels, max exp, and max cb level) automatic co-owner position on server (closed beta atm but when its open beta you&#39;re first on list.) thanks so much.</description>
