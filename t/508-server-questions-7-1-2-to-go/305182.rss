    <title>508 Server Questions [7 1/2 to go!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-server-questions-7-1-2-to-go/305182</link>
    <description>Hey all,
Today a friend and I managed to set up a 508 using tokkulscape&#39;s base, after many hours of trial and error, I am quite pleased with the result.

However, There are a few questions that have came up, and I would appreciate any positive input into solving my problems.

I plan to use this to help other people new to 508&#39;s, to help them, aswell as me.

My first question, I assume is going to be a biggie, and quite difficult to solve however here goes.

[b]1. In my current server, there is PvP Drops instead of classic pking drops, is there any way I can change this from one to the other?

2. When a player dies, they keep all of their items (even when skulled), can I change this to just keep three?

3. Dharoks and Guthans armour don&#39;t seem to have the desired special features (e.g. Dharoks hitting high when on low HP), is there any way I can add this? It also seems void has no bonus&#39; too.

4. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a shown level in the wilderness, is there any way to solve this?

5. [s]When you die, you spawn as a ghost[/s] on some weird place, [s]and have to &quot;revive&quot; to turn back into your avatar and play the game[/s]. How can I remove this feature all together, and just have the dead players arrive in lumbridge?[/b]
Seemed to have solved half of the problem, just cant get the rest.

[s][b]6. Each NPC seems horribly underpowered compared to the players in the game, for example soloing Bandos is an easy job, and can be done up to four times before banking. Is this normal? and if not - how would i go about changing it?[/b][/s]

[b]7. All crossbows, and bows in general don&#39;t seem to use arrows, however still require arrows to be equipped. They also don&#39;t show the correct animations(or no animations at all) when using the weapons, and Ava&#39;s Accumilator doesn&#39;t seem to be equipable. Any help on these problems?[/b]
[i](Quite a big question, but covers all range problems, so kept it as one)[/i]
I did a bit more investegation, and the DBow is treated like a normal bow. It only fires one shot, and the spec doesn&#39;t work. Is there a fix to this? As I think Dark Bows will be quite a useful pking weapon.

[s][b]8. It seems that the combat styles (attack, strength, defence/agressive, controlled ect) are mixed up, I&#39;m sure this is an easy fix, where would I find the code to change them?[/b][/s]

[b]9. Moving shops has become difficult. Tried to turn a seed shop into a range shop, and it just became untradable. Can anyone advise help on how to change this so that it works? and what files I need to change.

10. NPC movement needs to be fixed. At the moment, things like saradomin boss stays in one spot upon contact, however moves when not in combat. We would like her, and other monsters to move while in combat too. How would we go about doing this?[/b]

11. &quot;Buy-X&quot; option doesn&#39;t seem to exist, can i add this? Or add a &quot;Buy 10&quot; instead?

I&#39;m sure there will be more questions in the future, but any help on the current ones is much appreciated, thanks.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: September 29, 2009, 08:10:08 pm[/size][hr]Bump :) Please help</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>1 - Disable the set drops when they die. No idea about this on 508.<br>
5 - Find the applyDead() method or whatever it is called in 508 and change the location and the rest of what it is. That should fix it hopefully.<br>
7 - when the player is in combat every time they hit, get the player slot of the arrows and -1. No idea for 508.<br>
11 - “Buy x” when you click this it will send the option to the user to write how many they want to buy. use the buy 10 method and change it to buy the number entered into the interface or whatever.</p>
<p>Sorry if this was a load of crap for answers, but I was only trying to help and I’m not very familiar with 508 :S</p>
