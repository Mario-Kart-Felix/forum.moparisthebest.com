    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/augmenting-classes/415368</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been thinking about a way to increase the flexibility of my programs, and I wanted to know of this is possible.

BCEL Augmentation

This idea came to me when thinking about plugins. The idea behind BCEL Augmentation is to, well, augment classes at runtime, to enhance or add new features.

The way I thought about implementing this is for it to be initially an ASM type code; defining the constants for the constant pool, and using the JVM instructions. So perhaps something like

:CONSTANTS
Utf8_string, &quot;Title&quot;

:getTitle
ldc 0
areturn

Or something to that effect.

However, this whole process seems very extraneous, and I think that in the deep recesses of my mind I know of a better way to accomplish this.</description>

              <p>I came up with a solution to this problem between 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>Read object’s post, he lays down the ground work for you to build on. Content should be implemented over a domain model that is easy to use and completely decoupled from low-level network logic. The way I did this was by decoding packets into things that could be handled at a higher-level and more easily. Incoming raw packets were first aligned by their frame boundaries, and then decoded into game events which could be dispatched to listeners. One could simply swap revisions of the client by supplying new specifications of frame structures.</p>
<p>So, for example…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">(codec
 (codec-rule
  (frame 22
   ((frame-attribute string username)
    (frame-attribute string password)))
  (event
   dargd.game.event.LoginEvent
   (username
    password))
   :incoming))
...
)</code></pre>
<p>(not for RS, but still valid)</p>
<p>In your case specifically, though, extending behavior would be accomplished by handling the event logic in scripts. For newer revisions of RS, you’d simply load the appropriate scripts to handle the newer items.</p>
<p>Following up on my prior example, you’d implement a listener (in Scala) like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">bind(classOf[LoginEvent]) {
    event =&gt; {
        val service = Services.locate(classOf[EntityService])
        val account = service.lookup(classOf[Account], event.username)
        if (account != null &amp;&amp; account.password == event.password) {
            ... log 'em in ...
        } else {
            ... reject ...
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Note I’ve probably made some dumb mistakes, given I wrote all this in the reply box, but you ought to get the idea.<br>

I had a system like that on a server I was working on a while ago.  Basically, I dynamically loaded all the class files from a certain folder, and then had something like “ProtocolFile” that could be subclassed for different protocols, and the packet files could bind to their needed protocol.

Nothing with timers involved with that, and I actually had the system fully working with the exception of interaction between everything.  But the protocols and packets were loaded perfectly.</p>

              <p>zyle1992: I don’t think that’s the way to go. Separation of Concerns (SoC) is your friend.</p>
<p>First of all, create a Domain Model which represents your game logic. That is, logic that is the same for all versions. It’s pretty much only the communication between server and client that differ. Not the actual game logic. Well, sure, some versions of the game do have more features than others. But in that case, provide the logic in your Domain Model, but no way to perform said logic client- or server-wize in earlier versions. This Domain Model could be put in its own Jar file for Separation of Concerns (read up on DDD (Domain Driven Design) for better understanding of the Domain Model etc.).</p>
<p>Then you could use a Server Request Handler or a Message Broker to read the input data and dispatch to some Services in the Domain Model (a Service is a stateless class that performs some task in the Domain Model - usually if said task involves more than one Entity or Value Object (also for Separation of Concerns)). Of course the Server Request Handler or Message Broker could have some Protocol Strategy or contain some other means for registering protocol-specific information, so they can read the input data in a correct way and dispatch accordingly.</p>
<p>You could use an IoC-container (Spring Framework comes to mind) for changing this protocol-specific information and adding any Repository implementations you might need (Repository is used a lot within DDD). Instead of Spring Framework you could use a more light-weight solution, the java.util.ServiceLoader class. Although, it can only do a subset of what Spring Framework can do.</p>
<p>If you use Spring Framework, you’ll find another nice feature in there. Aspects (as mentioned earlier, by veer). They can be used for logging or transaction management etc. They’re good for cross-cutting concerns. Logging really isn’t the main responsibility for most classes (and you should keep the responsibility to a minimum), but it’s usually needed. So that’s a good place to start using Aspects.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>EDIT: After a drive home, I realize that augmenting the behavior is essentially <span class="bbcode-b">extending</span> the behavior, and I can simple <span class="bbcode-b">extend</span> the base or core class. This was quite an odd brainfart, and this thread can now be locked.</p>
<p>EDIT: Not exactly. Now I’m curious as to if it’s possible to apply this same behavior to a PacketHandler. I think it is, but not without some sort of jimmy-rigging.</p>
<p>Let’s say you have the default PacketHandler for Item-on-Item packets.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class ItemOnItemPacketHandler implements PacketHandler {
    @Override
    public void handle(final Client client, final Packet packet) {
        // handle default 317/377 items here
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>But then you decide to switch the server revision from 377 to 508. You would need to change the PacketHandler to incorporate the new items.</p>
<p>(Note: the class names are purely for completeness, and do not reflect actual class names)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public class HandlerFor508Items extends ItemOnItemPacketHandler {
    @Override
    public void handle(final Client client, final Packet packet) {
        // NOTE: It may be beneficial to have this return a boolean, as to whether
        // or not the packet was successfully handled
        if (!super.handle(client, packet)) {// Meaning that if the superclass couldn't handle the packet correctly
            // attempt to handle packet, now that more items have been added
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>How could I tell the server that the new “default” packet handler is the HandlerFor508Items, and not ItemOnItemPacketHandler? The only way I could think of would be to use a HashMap&lt;Integer, PacketHandler&gt; of sorts, and then just re-register the handler when the plugin is loaded.</p>
