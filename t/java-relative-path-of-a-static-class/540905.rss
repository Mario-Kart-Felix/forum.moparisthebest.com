    <title>Java relative path of a static class</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-relative-path-of-a-static-class/540905</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

For my &#39;tanks&#39; game which I am developing in Java I need to read a text file in which the map&#39;s data is stored.
I made a new class for this called &#39;MapReader&#39;.
However, I would like to be able to use the &#39;read&#39; function of the class without instantiating a new MapReader object.
That&#39;s why I made it a static class.

Now my problem is that I can&#39;t seem to find a way to get the relative path which is needed to load the file.
If it weren&#39;t static I would just be able to use new File(getClass().getResource(&quot;/maps/map.txt&quot;));</description>

And the class wasn’t just to load the text of a file, it had lots of other functions. And what if I did create it just to read the text of a file? What would be superfluous about it? It was a rather big project so I didn’t want to write code to read from a text file in a class which has not much to do with that. Just using it in a static context like <span class="bbcode-i">Map = IO.getMap();</span> is a great way to keep a nice overview on your code.[/quote]<br>
I see it as superfluous because I assumed you only needed to do it one time. The interface is nice like you said to be able to reference it like that but if you’re only trying to read a map file one time it just seems like a waste of code to me. I like programs written as simple as possible so if needed to distribute for others to see, they won’t be asking why the hell a whole new class was made or the design is just over the top, that’s all. But hey, we all choose to do things differently.</p>
<p>But yeah, if you’re using it for other functions as well then yeah I guess it makes sense.</p>

Thanks for your reply, but I don’t really understand how a singleton pattern would help?<br>
And due to it being rather imperative programming I’m not going to use it as our course is called ‘Object Oriented Programming’… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
[/quote]Just make the function static, not the entire class.[/quote]</p>
<p>This.</p>
<p>You don’t need to instantiate a class to access it’s static methods (assuming they are not private); they are accessed via the class name as opposed to an object reference.</p>
<p>ClassFoo.staticmethod(derp);</p>
<p>Hell you could even do:</p>
<p>import static SomeClass;</p>
<p>and access all of that classes static(class) methods/fields as if they were in the class you’re working on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit -<br>
Unless of course you are referencing a static <span class="bbcode-b">inner</span> class. Static inner classes can be instantiated without an instance of the containing class.</li>
</ul>

Thanks for your reply, but I don’t really understand how a singleton pattern would help?<br>
And due to it being rather imperative programming I’m not going to use it as our course is called ‘Object Oriented Programming’… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
[/quote]Just make the function static, not the entire class.[/quote]</p>
<p>The reason I made the function / class static was that I wouldn’t have to create a new object to use the function. If I would make only the function static, I would still have this problem since I’m not instantiating the class <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Thanks anyhow!</p>
<p>But I’ve found the solution.<br>
I just had to replace getClass() by class().</p>
<p>I’ve already tried that and thought it was wrong.<br>
Now I realise I was looking at it the wrong way and that it actually works… (:</p>
<p>But the reason it wouldn’t work earlier was that I had a space character in the path!</p>
<p>If I printed out the path it would replace the space character by a ‘%20’ (hex for 32, which is it’s ASCII code!)</p>
<p>I solved the problem by simply removing the space character.<br>
But… if I really wanted to keep the space for some reason, would the best solution be finding the path this way and then converting the %20 to a space character?</p>

              <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>For my ‘tanks’ game which I am developing in Java I need to read a text file in which the map’s data is stored.<br>
I made a new class for this called ‘MapReader’.<br>
However, I would like to be able to use the ‘read’ function of the class without instantiating a new MapReader object.<br>
That’s why I made it a static class.</p>
<p>Now my problem is that I can’t seem to find a way to get the relative path which is needed to load the file.<br>
If it weren’t static I would just be able to use new File(getClass().getResource("/maps/map.txt"));</p>
