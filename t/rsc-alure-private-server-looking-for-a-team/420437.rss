    <title>RSC Alure Private Server - Looking for a team!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsc-alure-private-server-looking-for-a-team/420437</link>
    <description>Hello fellow community members,

I would like all of you to know that RSC Alure is still under development, and now I am looking for a team!

You are able to apply in this topic for one of the following jobs:


[b]- Lead website developper and designer:[/b]
Knowledge of html and php required. Also likes to play with adobe products.

[b]- Forum moderator:[/b]
[b]- Forum moderator:[/b]

[b]- Lead Administrator:[/b] King Beer
[b]- Co-Administrator:[/b]

[b]- In-game Moderator:[/b] xTreme
[b]- In-game Moderator:[/b]
[b]- In-game Moderator:[/b]
[b]- In-game Moderator:[/b]
[b]- In-game Moderator:[/b]

Please note, that the Co-Administrator will not be chosen directly, abuse of powers is strongly forbidden and everything is being logged.

If you feel you can and want to contribute in any other way, just let me know!

RSC Alure has been online once, running the RSC Angel Source with many bugs, because of these bugs and of course also thanks to other reasons the inactivity on the server slowly ended up to only a few to none being online at the same time.

Since hardly anyone was online, I&#39;ve shut it down and I had downloaded the DarkQuest source, I&#39;ve been trying to get all bugs out of the source, so it would be a stable server. Only recently I&#39;ve managed to remove the stat panel from that source, thanks to Cleako&#39;s suggestion about downloading revision 69 instead of the HEAD revision, instead I have removed and added all previous code in the source I was working on.

The reason I also chose DarkQuest is because all items/objects/shops, etc are being loaded from the SQL Database, thanks to some commands in-game it is very easy to add new objects, and of course I want to build a new world within the recent one.

The server will be up within one to two weeks from now on, only for development and testing. If anyone would like to join this project, either post in here or PM me.

All staff members will have their title in-game, please note I am looking for a mature team, English language should be mastered.

I hope there&#39;s still some interest in RSC Servers, if anyone would like to see the update progress, check www.rscalure.net register and visit the forums.

Please note that this is a temporary website, credits to sw0o0sh for releasing it, also I would like to thank everyone that contributed to the RSC Scene, xEnt, Peeter, Kryptix, Cleako, and all others, I&#39;d like to thank all.

I know many of you like to flame, but I don&#39;t and I will ignore those posts, I hope a moparscape moderator or admin would be dedicated in removing any spam from this topic.

Yours sincerely,

King Beer.</description>

              <p>Kudos, most people just host a slightly edited source, I like to see people actually develop.</p>
<p>I really hope your not hiring everyone who posts here, or the mod team would destroy all your work. Your best bet is to only hire the actually good people… then Nolife ingame to hear all suggestions/search for a staff team.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>
