Jeez, instead of basing an entire update on GUI. Why don’t they clean up or change how the operating system works. Then all the viruses from Win7, XP, and Vista won’t carry over.<br>
[/quote]You mean like rewrite the kernel? Lol? That is not something that happes in 1 2 3 you know. They re-use their kernel for a reason.<br>
[/quote]Yes, exactly. Microsoft is so huge, that doing so couldn’t be easier. (Not implying that it’s a piece of cake, but… You know what I mean.) It’s not cool that they name it Windows 8 and all they did was update the GUI and made tiny tweaks. The least they could do is clean the kernel up and make it operate smoother.</p>
<p>[/quote]There’s where we collide, the kernel of Windows is as smooth as it gets. I installed Windows 7 Ultimate on my first pc ever to test the OS. I was 9 when I got my first pc. It’s a Pentium 4 so it’s not THAT old but it’s old. The OS ran really smooth on it and I’ve put the pc downstaird with 7 Ultimate as a family pc because it actully works really good on it. So why change the kernel if it is working like a charm? I mean, if you have a perfect kernel there’s no reason in changing them. I know people are going to start and bitch about viruses and crashes. But that is not due to the shitness of the OS. It’s due poorly coded programs. We get crashes and viruses because Windows gave us freedom to code what we want unlike Apple. And I like it that way. So at the moment I’d say to Windows, make a new UI, make some tweaks and you’re good to go.[/quote]</p>
<p>No… people get viruses because they don’t know how to browse the internet properly.</p>

Jeez, instead of basing an entire update on GUI. Why don’t they clean up or change how the operating system works. Then all the viruses from Win7, XP, and Vista won’t carry over.<br>
[/quote]You mean like rewrite the kernel? Lol? That is not something that happes in 1 2 3 you know. They re-use their kernel for a reason.<br>
[/quote]Yes, exactly. Microsoft is so huge, that doing so couldn’t be easier. (Not implying that it’s a piece of cake, but… You know what I mean.) It’s not cool that they name it Windows 8 and all they did was update the GUI and made tiny tweaks. The least they could do is clean the kernel up and make it operate smoother.</p>
<p>[/quote]There’s where we collide, the kernel of Windows is as smooth as it gets. I installed Windows 7 Ultimate on my first pc ever to test the OS. I was 9 when I got my first pc. It’s a Pentium 4 so it’s not THAT old but it’s old. The OS ran really smooth on it and I’ve put the pc downstaird with 7 Ultimate as a family pc because it actully works really good on it. So why change the kernel if it is working like a charm? I mean, if you have a perfect kernel there’s no reason in changing them. I know people are going to start and bitch about viruses and crashes. But that is not due to the shitness of the OS. It’s due poorly coded programs. We get crashes and viruses because Windows gave us freedom to code what we want unlike Apple. And I like it that way. So at the moment I’d say to Windows, make a new UI, make some tweaks and you’re good to go.<br>
[/quote]If you consider my Win7 laptop’s Microsoft Word a poorly programmed program then i suppose you’re correct. But by smoother I meant, faster and more efficient, for some reason Win7 needs 1GB RAM to run, which I had for 2 days on my laptop, then after enduring what felt like hours worth of waiting when opening and closing programs, I freaked out and got the max 4GBs of RAM and a refreshing distribution of Linux.<br>
[/quote]Got nothing to say against that, but yeah if they could make it run smoother on low end devices, that would be better. I don’t have any lack of smoothness problems on this copy that’s already running 1.5 years on my laptop. And it’s not the greatest laptop out there.<br>
[/quote]Hmm, that’s weird, because my laptop came to my doorstep slow as shit. Haha.[/quote]You should watch the new video I posted (on the first page), see the smoothness of it on that tablet. I mean, look at the new features, look at how he swithes back and forth from the new UI to our old UI. It’s just amazing. At least that’s my opinion. I’ve always looked for something that refreshing.</p>

[/quote]Brother, how much ram do you think those tablets have?<br>
[/quote]The Ipad comes with 512 MB. So I’m guessing the windows tablets will have around 2GB for the same price.[/quote]I’d give it maximum 1GB. I don’t see why low ram is a problem these days. First of all, ram is extremely cheap. Like really, CHEAP. Second of all, I don’t see how someone has a PC running lower than 1.5 gigs ram. Also, performance is not based on RAM, I’m not saying it hasn’t got anything to do with it. But most of the work is done by a processor. Lagg, shitty smoothness is 95% of the time caused by shitty processors or overheating processors.</p>
