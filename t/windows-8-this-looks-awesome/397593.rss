^^Official Microsoft Video^^


Honestly, THIS LOOKS AMAZING.


I mean, it will be easy to use on ANY device.


The new UI looks so smooth and beautiful. And while it being new, the old UI is still there wich makes it even more awesome. I can&#39;t wait for Windows 8 to come out or for some early builds that are actully stable.


Check it out!!!


What do [b]YOU[/b] think about Windows 8?</description>

First of all, ram is extremely cheap. Like really, CHEAP. Second of all, I don’t see how someone has a PC running lower than 1.5 gigs ram. Also, performance is not based on RAM, I’m not saying it hasn’t got anything to do with it. But most of the work is done by a processor. Lagg, shitty smoothness is 95% of the time caused by shitty processors or overheating processors.</p>

Jeez, instead of basing an entire update on GUI. Why don’t they clean up or change how the operating system works. Then all the viruses from Win7, XP, and Vista won’t carry over.<br>
[/quote]You mean like rewrite the kernel? Lol? That is not something that happes in 1 2 3 you know. They re-use their kernel for a reason.<br>
[/quote]Yes, exactly. Microsoft is so huge, that doing so couldn’t be easier. (Not implying that it’s a piece of cake, but… You know what I mean.) It’s not cool that they name it Windows 8 and all they did was update the GUI and made tiny tweaks. The least they could do is clean the kernel up and make it operate smoother.</p>
<p>[/quote]There’s where we collide, the kernel of Windows is as smooth as it gets. I installed Windows 7 Ultimate on my first pc ever to test the OS. I was 9 when I got my first pc. It’s a Pentium 4 so it’s not THAT old but it’s old. The OS ran really smooth on it and I’ve put the pc downstaird with 7 Ultimate as a family pc because it actully works really good on it. So why change the kernel if it is working like a charm? I mean, if you have a perfect kernel there’s no reason in changing them. I know people are going to start and bitch about viruses and crashes. But that is not due to the shitness of the OS. It’s due poorly coded programs. We get crashes and viruses because Windows gave us freedom to code what we want unlike Apple. And I like it that way. So at the moment I’d say to Windows, make a new UI, make some tweaks and you’re good to go.<br>
[/quote]If you consider my Win7 laptop’s Microsoft Word a poorly programmed program then i suppose you’re correct. But by smoother I meant, faster and more efficient, for some reason Win7 needs 1GB RAM to run, which I had for 2 days on my laptop, then after enduring what felt like hours worth of waiting when opening and closing programs, I freaked out and got the max 4GBs of RAM and a refreshing distribution of Linux.<br>
[/quote]Got nothing to say against that, but yeah if they could make it run smoother on low end devices, that would be better. I don’t have any lack of smoothness problems on this copy that’s already running 1.5 years on my laptop. And it’s not the greatest laptop out there.<br>
[/quote]Hmm, that’s weird, because my laptop came to my doorstep slow as shit. Haha.<br>
[/quote]You should watch the new video I posted (on the first page), see the smoothness of it on that tablet. I mean, look at the new features, look at how he swithes back and forth from the new UI to our old UI. It’s just amazing. At least that’s my opinion. I’ve always looked for something that refreshing.[/quote]Yea, I saw it. It’ll probably kinda hard to get used to, don’t you think?</p>

Jeez, instead of basing an entire update on GUI. Why don’t they clean up or change how the operating system works. Then all the viruses from Win7, XP, and Vista won’t carry over.<br>
[/quote]You mean like rewrite the kernel? Lol? That is not something that happes in 1 2 3 you know. They re-use their kernel for a reason.<br>
[/quote]Yes, exactly. Microsoft is so huge, that doing so couldn’t be easier. (Not implying that it’s a piece of cake, but… You know what I mean.) It’s not cool that they name it Windows 8 and all they did was update the GUI and made tiny tweaks. The least they could do is clean the kernel up and make it operate smoother.</p>
<p>[/quote]There’s where we collide, the kernel of Windows is as smooth as it gets. I installed Windows 7 Ultimate on my first pc ever to test the OS. I was 9 when I got my first pc. It’s a Pentium 4 so it’s not THAT old but it’s old. The OS ran really smooth on it and I’ve put the pc downstaird with 7 Ultimate as a family pc because it actully works really good on it. So why change the kernel if it is working like a charm? I mean, if you have a perfect kernel there’s no reason in changing them. I know people are going to start and bitch about viruses and crashes. But that is not due to the shitness of the OS. It’s due poorly coded programs. We get crashes and viruses because Windows gave us freedom to code what we want unlike Apple. And I like it that way. So at the moment I’d say to Windows, make a new UI, make some tweaks and you’re good to go.<br>
[/quote]If you consider my Win7 laptop’s Microsoft Word a poorly programmed program then i suppose you’re correct. But by smoother I meant, faster and more efficient, for some reason Win7 needs 1GB RAM to run, which I had for 2 days on my laptop, then after enduring what felt like hours worth of waiting when opening and closing programs, I freaked out and got the max 4GBs of RAM and a refreshing distribution of Linux. [/quote]Got nothing to say against that, but yeah if they could make it run smoother on low end devices, that would be better. I don’t have any lack of smoothness problems on this copy that’s already running 1.5 years on my laptop. And it’s not the greatest laptop out there.</p>

Ubuntu is the most populair distribution of Linux. There are MANY distros of Linux because of the fact that it is open source. I hope this helped.</p>
<p>My favorites are Mint and Backtrack, got them both on dual boot.</p>

I keep saying to myself I’m going to get windows 7, and I never do. I think I’ll just stick with Linux/Vista dual boot <em>sigh</em><br>
[/quote]<br>
Don’t worry, windows 7 isn’t that great, I mean its like going from an iPhone to an HTC, theres a few differences in apps and stuff buts its same old same old. I have windows 7 on a disk somewhere around here and I’m still using xp.[/quote]You’re kidding me, right? I owned a Droid for 2 years and have owned an iPhone for 1, and I FUCKING hate it. There’s so much of a difference. (At least, to anybody that cares about having control over their phone.) I will never get another iPhone; or any other apple product.</p>
