    <title>Password Flash Addon</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/password-flash-addon/96113</link>
    <description>Sorry, not sure how to post a .swf file on mopar as an image. I made it for any type of flash program that i&#39;ll make in the future that I think will need a password. The password for the one I posted on deviantart is &quot;theblackfortress&quot;. I can&#39;t find any sites that host .fla&#39;s, so just IM me on aim, yahoo, or msn and i&#39;ll give it to you through there. Please rate.

this isn’t worth telling a community that you just figured out how to check dynamic text.</p>
<p>I am not intensionally flaming(If I am) I am just saying that if you want people to want to think you are good, you need to do much better, only the clue-less ones will think it is cool (no offense goatee,   <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> )and slightly useful(easily cracked).<br>
Rating: 0.0000000000000001 out of 10.(normally the float of that would be rounded down to 0)</p>
<p>I would suggest you incorporate this into php using a sessions and defining the php, using POST, so say load the variables from “bleh.php” using post to define the name of it. get the current time in explosion, ask a different php file providing that time, the php file will have a tolerance to the amount of time difference, such as 2 seconds, then if accepted, include the php file that either uses a MySQL database or  physically holds the passwords, then verify that in flash using an MD5 encryption of the password(use another php file &amp; POST to get that) If both MD5’s are true(on both php &amp; flash) it will go to the next content. Security can go quite extreme when it comes to php and flash ;D Trust me, I do know.[/quote]</p>
<p>Honestly, I agree with everything you say and take it as constructive critiscism. But seeing as this is supposed to protect from computer illiterate people that don’t even know how to extract the source code of an .swf, I don’t think i need to do much security.</p>

              <p>Why not put it into a RAR file and upload it here or megaupload.</p>
<p>Also i don’t see how this would be efficient because you could just get other people to tell you the password.<br>
Anywho cool thingy.</p>
