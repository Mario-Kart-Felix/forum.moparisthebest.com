    <title>I got a bit of a problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-got-a-bit-of-a-problem/176189</link>
    <description>ok so i added the ::nick command to my server and its becomming a problem becuz when i used it on my co-owner (::nick x cheese x) i wound up taking her account, like  her pass changed to mine and i don&#39;t want that happening in case one of my admins decide to nick a normal player then they will lose their account and when i recofver it for them it&#39;ll have the admins rights, bank, equpment, etc...  does any one have a different nick command?

here is mine
[code]
            	} else if (command.startsWith(&quot;nick&quot;)
                    	&amp;&amp; playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Glabay&quot;)) {
                	try {
                   	playerName = command.substring(5);
                    	updateRequired = true;
                    	appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
                	} catch (Exception e) {
                    	sendMessage(&quot;Wrong Syntax! Use as ::nick [NEWNAME]&quot;);
                	}
[/code]</description>
