    <description>[center][b]Your Second Script-PowerCutter[/b][/center]

	What we are going to cover. Anti-Randoms and a mediocre cutting procedure. Well I hope you learn something so lets start. Copy and Paste everything in code to your SCAR window, because I have written some notes in the script.

[center][b]Starting Your Script[/b][/center]	
Start off with the basic setup, call SRL and put it in your Main Loop.
[code]
Program SPC;
{.include SRL/SRL.Scar}//This calls SRL and allows access to SRL functions
{.include SRL/SRL/Skill/WoodCutting.Scar}//Woodcutting SRL

Begin
  SetupSRL;//Sets up SRL, Without this   ^ That is useless so declare this.
End.
[/code]
[center][b]Variables and Consts[/b][/center]
	Our next step is setting up the const and variables. You  tell SCAR it’s a variable or a const by putting almost anywhere. There are many types of variables such as, 
String-This holds a piece of text. Integer-This is just a number. Boolean- A Boolean is a true or false answer, or result, used in functions.
[center][b]Example[/b][/center]
[code]
Var                  // A Variable is something that can be changed while script is running
       A  :  Integer;
       

Const             // Preset values set before script is run and used for Script Setup and colors
       B = 1 ; //A const can be any type of variable  Integer
       B = True; Boolean
       B = ‘Hi’; String
[/code]
[center][b]What to Add[/b][/center]
[code]
Program SPC;
{.include SRL/SRL.Scar}//This calls SRL and allows access to SRL functions
{.include SRL/SRL/Skill/WoodCutting.Scar}//Woodcutting SRL

Var
      x, y, color : Integer;

Const
      Color = 3232622; // Color, you can leave alone for now
      TTC = 20000; // Time it takes to cut tree down (MilliSeconds) Just add three 0’s

Begin
  SetupSRL;//Sets up SRL
End.
[/code]
[center][b]Anti-Randoms[/b][/center]

	Well anti-randoms solve randoms if they appear, as anti-randoms mess up your script. Here is my basic anti-randoms which use and I like it. Note: Some randoms are unable to be solved as SRL has not mad one for it.
Example
[code]
Procedure FindThoseRandoms;
begin
  if(FindFight)then //Finds if you are in a fight (Returns result as a Boolean)
  begin
    RunAwayDirection(&#39;N&#39;);  //Runs away north
    Wait(9500+Random(5500)); // My wait times You may change them. Random(5500) means that it will add anything in between 5500 and 0 to the 9500
    RunBack; // Runs back to other position
  end;
  if(FindDead)then //Finds if you are dead or not if so the Result is Yes.
  begin
    Writeln(&#39;You are Dead!&#39;);  //Writes that you are dead in debug box
   TerminateScript; //Stops script
    begin
  FindMod; //Solves randoms and solves if possible
  DwarfItem;
  SolveFrog;
  FindCerter;
  FindDemon;
  DwarfItem;
  FindQuiz;
  SolveBox;
  SolvePinball;
  SolveNonTalkingRandoms;
  SolveSandWich;
  FindNormalRandoms;
  FindFastRandoms;
  FindLamp(&#39;woodcutting&#39;); //If it finds a lamp it presses woodcutting 
    end;
  end;
  end;
end;
[/code]
[center][b]So Far Now[/b][/center][code] Program SPC;
{.include SRL/SRL.Scar}//This calls SRL and allows access to SRL functions
{.include SRL/SRL/Skill/WoodCutting.Scar}//Woodcutting SRL

Var
      x, y, color : Integer;

Const
      Color = 3232622; // Color, you can leave alone for now
      TTC = 20000; // Time it takes to cut tree down (MilliSeconds) Just add three 0’s

Procedure FindThoseRandoms;
begin
  if(FindFight)then //Finds if you are in a fight (Returns result as a Boolean)
  begin
    RunAwayDirection(&#39;N&#39;);  //Runs away north
    Wait(9500+Random(5500)); // My wait times You may change them. Random(5500) means that it will add anything {in between 5500 and 0 to the 9500}
    RunBack; // Runs back to other position
  end;
  if(FindDead)then //Finds if you are dead or not if so the Result is Yes.
  begin
    Writeln(&#39;You are Dead!&#39;);  //Writes that you are dead in debug box
   TerminateScript; //Stops script
    begin
  FindMod; //Solves randoms and solves if possible
  DwarfItem;
  SolveFrog;
  FindCerter;
  FindDemon;
  DwarfItem;
  FindQuiz;
  SolveBox;
  SolvePinball;
  SolveNonTalkingRandoms;
  SolveSandWich;
  FindNormalRandoms;
  FindFastRandoms;
  FindLamp(&#39;woodcutting&#39;); //If it finds a lamp it presses woodcutting 
    end;
  end;
  end;
end;


Begin
  SetupSRL;//Sets up SRL
End.
[/code]
[center][b]Chopping[/b][/center]
	Well this is one of the main parts of a script so it is critical to really think about it and spend quite a bit of time on it. Of course this one won’t but I hope it will inspire you to make a good one.
[center][b]Example[/b][/center]
[code]
procedure ChopTree;
begin
repeat //Repeats the following until something happens down below
  if not Loggedin then Exit; //If not logged in the exit, this is a failsafe and is need for good scripts
   begin
    FindEnt(x,y, True); //A function in SRL. X and Y are the coordinates that can be change don’t, The True means if found solve it. If changed to false don’t solve
    if FindObjCustom(x, y, [&#39;Willow&#39;,’illo’], [Color], 10) then // If it finds an object then… x and y once again the coords {found at. The second option is what your looking for you can put more than one as I have shown. Color, this can be more than one color but this will be the color it searches for. Finally 10, this is the tolerance. 10 is a good place to keep it at.}
    begin
      Mouse(x, y, 0, 0, False);// This just moves the mouse then clicks, False means Right click and True means Left {click.}
      FindThoseRandoms;// Finds the randoms, we made this procedure earlier
      if ChooseOption(&#39;hop&#39;) then // okay so you are right clicked and you have the menu popped up so this finds to {see if the text there}
       begin
         wait(TTC);// This is the time to cut tree
       end else
       begin
        if not FindObjCustom(x, y, [&#39;Willow&#39;], [Color2], 10) then // same thing as above just                                    {used a different color}
         begin
       WriteLn(&#39; Cannot find Tree’); //Well this just says it can’t find the tree
       Exit;
         end;
       end;
    end;
  end;
  Until(InvFull)// This is were it all comes together, the repeat stops if this is done
end;
[/code]
[center][b]It’s all wrapped together[/b][/center]
