    <title>[PI] How do I fix my shops? They won&#39;t work after being added!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-how-do-i-fix-my-shops-they-wont-work-after-being-added/373553</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve created some different shops. Here&#39;s the process I used to create the shop.

Opened actionhanderl.java and added:

[code]		case 523:
			c.getShops().openShop(30);
			break;[/code]

After that I opened shops.cfg and added:

[code]shop = 30	Amulet Store	2	2	1731	10	1727	10	1725	10	1729	10	1712	10[/code]

Finally, I opened spawn-config.cfg and added:

[code]spawn = 523	3231	3203	0	0	0	0	0	Amulet Store[/code]

After restarting the server and visiting the location I added the shop, I can clearly see the NPC is there and after clicking &quot;Talk to *blank*&quot;, the shop opens up, though I cannot purchase any items from the shop. This doesn&#39;t make any sense to me because I&#39;ve added other shops the exact same way before and they worked fine. Someone previously mentioned it had to do with something in shopAssistant.java, but he didn&#39;t tell me what to change or how to change it. I really need help because I need these new shops on my server. I&#39;d really appreciate any help possible.</description>

<p>Yes, I’ve already received this response multiple times, I’m looking for the method of adding those “properties”.</p>
<p>I’ve literally searched the entire Moparscape and Rune-Server websites and have found nothing.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to help though.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I’ve created some different shops. Here’s the process I used to create the shop.</p>
<p>Opened actionhanderl.java and added:</p>
<p><code>		case 523:
			c.getShops().openShop(30);
			break;</code></p>
<p>After that I opened shops.cfg and added:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">shop = 30	Amulet Store	2	2	1731	10	1727	10	1725	10	1729	10	1712	10</code></pre>
<p>Finally, I opened spawn-config.cfg and added:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 523	3231	3203	0	0	0	0	0	Amulet Store</code></pre>
<p>After restarting the server and visiting the location I added the shop, I can clearly see the NPC is there and after clicking “Talk to <em>blank</em>”, the shop opens up, though I cannot purchase any items from the shop. This doesn’t make any sense to me because I’ve added other shops the exact same way before and they worked fine. Someone previously mentioned it had to do with something in shopAssistant.java, but he didn’t tell me what to change or how to change it. I really need help because I need these new shops on my server. I’d really appreciate any help possible.</p>
