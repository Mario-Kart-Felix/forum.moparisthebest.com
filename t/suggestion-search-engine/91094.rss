    <title>[Suggestion]Search Engine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-search-engine/91094</link>
    <description>Ok, what if we were to put a Search engine after the TOS, before you enter the forums, and when using the search engine, you have a text entry field, 3 buttons, and a basic blue background. 

1st button says, submit question. 2nd says Visit MoparScape.org. and the 3rd says, Visit moparisthebest.com. That way, it keeps all of the Moparscapers where they should be, and us, where we need to be.</description>
