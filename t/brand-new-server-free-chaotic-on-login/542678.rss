              <p>Okay. I’m no advertising expert (no where NEAR it) but some tips:<br>
Pictures speak louder than words (I didn’t read more than 5 lines…)<br>
Why would it be against the rules to advertise in the <span class="bbcode-u">advertisement</span> section?<br>
Don’t list common features. Your server (reading back on what you typed) seems generic. It seems like any other server.<br>
Tell us what sets you different; what makes your server worth playing…<br>
Where’s your website? Your… anything? Websites (nowadays) are simple to set up and you can easily find a free one to suit your needs. Why isn’t it listed?<br>
I understand you may be new. But take a look around in this section. See all those servers? That’s your competition.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to be mean, but in all honesty, your server seems like any other server out there.</p>
