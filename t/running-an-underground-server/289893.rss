    <title>Running an underground server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-an-underground-server/289893</link>
    <description>i need to run a server literally under the ground (only like 50cm down). however ive done nothing like this before and i dont know how the server will cope so im not going to jump in and just do it.

the first issue is cooling,
does it even need a fan system? because the ground is like a massive heatsync maintained at a fairly constant temperature. i imagine the air inside would need to be circulated though.. does anyone have any specific suggestions on what exactly do to?

second issue is air quality and waterproofing,
obviously it will need to be in some sort of waterproof canister but will the air also need to be damp free? if i did this, i would probably have to deal with pressure differences too?

can someone enlighten me on any other issues i&#39;d have to take into consideration and how to solve them?</description>

<p>You will need ventilation, two pipes each with a fan (spinning opposite directions) would work. You will also have to worry about rain and debris getting into the pipes though. There will be moisture and stuff like worms/roots so a Plexiglas box with caulking around the edges will be required. Make sure you have enough space around the case for air to move (5-10cm).<br>
How do you plan on getting power and ethernet down there? Also, how will you reboot it if the power goes out?</p>
