[b]Runepact is a project that will hopefully become a great server. As in many other projects, many goals are highly dreamed of; this will lead us to our dedication of putting nothing but hard work into the server. We hope that this development thread will not only help keep our dedication strong due to the support, but also inspire others that dreams are achievable.[/b][/center]

I’d be glad to invite you to the team as the web developer. I have a great environment you can work in, so hopefully you will enjoy that. Also, do you have any other means of communication besides Moparscape?</p>
<p>Also, I meant to post this in server development, so I’m just going to move the bit about the skills to the developer section. Sorry  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
