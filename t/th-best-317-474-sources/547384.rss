    <title>Th best 317-474 sources</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/th-best-317-474-sources/547384</link>
    <description>I am switching my current server to a new source/base, however, I cannot find a decent enough source. What do you guys think? My server is completely ECO based. Skilling &amp; PKing are the way to  make money. I am looking at a few, but I would like to get a feel for what you guys think is the best source I should use.

This is the only revision I want along with old school gameframe, if that helps any,

Thanks!</description>
