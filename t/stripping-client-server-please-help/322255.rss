    <description>Alright, i&#39;m creating a modified version of runescape. it&#39;s going to be VERY modified where you can barely tell it&#39;s runescape.

Alright, first.
How to do i remove to XP stuff? Such as Attack XP, Magic XP, Construction XP, and stuff like that.
To where it&#39;s just a blank box with nothing at all inside of it?

I&#39;ve looked everyone in the client, and in the server. going through file by file searching. I can NOT find it. anyone who can help, that would be awesome.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 27, 2009, 12:48:33 pm[/size][hr]bumpbump, i still have this problem!</description>
