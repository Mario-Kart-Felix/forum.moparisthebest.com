              <p>[quote=“Ollie, post:4, topic:380831”]Greeny, it happened on Granville Rd, near the Total Garage, slightly further down the road from Sainsburys/McDonalds.</p>
<p>I was fairly drunk as well, I didn’t bother to fight back as there was 3 of them and 1 of me, rather just get a few punches then a full on kick in.</p>
<p>my phone was hidden yes, they didn’t even get anything of value really, wallet worth £10, bank card (which is now cancelled), and my drivers licence, along with £8 in change, I think they thought I had more on me.</p>
<p>Its bad because I now cant even go to the bank and get any money out as I have no ID, so I’m pretty much skinted until my card arrives, however its arriving at my home and not at Manchester. Bit of a shit situation, looks like I will be playing alot more runescape in the next couple of weeks.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sucks man, was walking home with a friend once and two guys tried to get fussy with us.

What causes people to mug others? I say it’s because of all the rappers and films that portray a glorious thug-life and hide the scum of it. So shouldn’t some of that be censored from the public?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say that that’s the cause of it. It’s more of a result. The cause is a lack of a decent future for a lot of (black) kids. They can’t, and in many cases are not allowed, to properly integrate into the normal society. We have this problem with immigrants from Muslim countries. Most of the kids are second generation, they were born here. But their parents mainly get the jobs that we don’t want to do anymore, like cleaning offices. They don’t integrate properly, they stick together and that way they create their own small communities. It’s very hard for their kids to imagine a better future for themselves, so they give up trying to achieve something.</p>
<p>I don’t know a solution for this problem. I do know that dickhead populist politicians make it worse for everyone.[/quote]<br>
I see how uneducated immigrants can put muggers on the street, but I have to disagree with the integration part. I myself find it difficult to integrate into society as I have moved countries frequently, but I don’t resort to mugging, rap music and the like.</p>
<p>Also, if it wasn’t for the way that thug-life is portrayed in music and films, don’t you think these particular immigrants would resort to other cultures to satisfy their ego?</p>

If you’re a minority and you graduated high-school with a pretty good GPA and no records you can easily get a loan, go to college, meet a normal woman there, have a planned baby, treat it right and discipline it right.</p>

<p>I agree with this sentiment. Not going to say that people are completely blameless as individuals, but it would be hard for them.<br>
There’s a film, Freedom Writers, that sorta gives insight into the lives of people who come from that downtrodden demographic. I wrote an essay on the film back in high school.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say that that’s the cause of it. It’s more of a result. The cause is a lack of a decent future for a lot of (black) kids. They can’t, and in many cases are not allowed, to properly integrate into the normal society. We have this problem with immigrants from Muslim countries. Most of the kids are second generation, they were born here. But their parents mainly get the jobs that we don’t want to do anymore, like cleaning offices. They don’t integrate properly, they stick together and that way they create their own small communities. It’s very hard for their kids to imagine a better future for themselves, so they give up trying to achieve something.</p>
<p>I don’t know a solution for this problem. I do know that dickhead populist politicians make it worse for everyone.</p>

I knew that guy from the area, he is known for robbing, and getting beat up for it, but he never learns. I know a guy from my school was followed by three niggers from the mall to the library and they decided to rob and stab him in the library. One of my friends, a year ago…was mugged by a nigger and some white-guy, he gave them his stuff and when they were both turned to walk away, he low blowed them and made a citizen’s arrest.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Only read the first page of this thread at the time of writing. I have some mugging stories.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in this area for about 10 years, it’s quite a bad area in the inner city with much deprivation. When I was around 14 and walking home from school wearing school uniform is when muggings happened. Here are some of my memories.</p>
<p>The first time it happened I was in a nice-looking street which was next to a rough estate. A was walking along and a guy says ‘hey’. I turn around and see a black guy in a hood wearing a balaclava. He tells me to keep walking, to ‘be cool’ (which I believe is a command to keep calm) and to ‘stop making it hot’. He taps my pockets and demands my mobile phone. I didn’t have one then. He notices my watch (a crappy plastic one) and requests it. I stall a little, pretend I didn’t hear, have slow movements. At that point he notices a woman pushing a child in a buggy and walks away quickly.</p>
<p>Once I got mugged the same day twice.<br>
The first time was at the entrance of a park I was about to walk through. Two guys approach and one of them asks if I have money. When I say no he complains that kids these days don’t have any money and leaves.<br>
Further along that journey, a short guy approaches and orders my pockets turned out. Upon learning I have nothing of value (I never carried anything then partly due to muggings) he threatens to stab me. We were standing close to some houses and at that point a tall built man opens his front door and demands to know what’s going on. The mugger leaves.</p>
<p>A few days later, the guy who mugged me at the entrance of the park approached me again. I recognised him but he didn’t remember me.</p>
<p>I’ve never had any property lost to muggers. It was mostly due to them that I didn’t buy a mobile phone until I was 16 (and didn’t wear school uniform anymore). I reckon muggers see people in school uniform as good targets.<br>
So here’s some thoughts I’ve had due to my experiences.</p>
<p>Its irrational to be afraid of dark places if you think they’ll make muggings more likely. Thieves will go for people in broad daylight. A policeman once told me most reports they get happen right after schools finish, not night time. I reckon muggers are afraid more of witnesses than light.</p>
<p>If you think someone is following you, don’t speed up your walk. It seems people are more likely to go for you if they think you’re scared. Instead slow down. Especially if you’re in a situation where you’ve just turned off a main road into a side street. If you speed up by the time they catch you you’ll be far away from the main road thus witnesses. Also if you walk slowly and maybe even stop for a few seconds you might appear confident and awesome.</p>
<p>If walking late at night and worried. Walk right in the center of the road. You should be right in the glare of streetlights and have empty space all around you. If someone approaches you can have at least a few seconds warning. Cars are rare at night and you can just move out their way.</p>
<p>I haven’t been mugged ever since I stopped wearing school uniform. In fact once or twice I’ve walked down the street with over a thousand pounds in my (inside) coat pocket. Okay the first time I ever did that I stuffed the envelope under my belt and tucked my shirt over it.</p>
