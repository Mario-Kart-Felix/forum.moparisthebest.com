    <title>Please help me im really confused</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-help-me-im-really-confused/478576</link>
    <description>everytime iv put 677 loading 700+ online before the source comes with the cache so when you change the clients ip it gets the cache from your source but iv just updated to a new source and client and for some reason when i put it online to test it for some reason it just sticks on 1% checking for updates.

i havnt really made any changes to the source as im not putting it online for the public just me and a few friends to train at nex.
just thought i would add that.

EDIT
also the cache works perfectly using 127.0.0.1 but once i change the ips in client.java and loader.java it just doesnt load the cache anymore...</description>
