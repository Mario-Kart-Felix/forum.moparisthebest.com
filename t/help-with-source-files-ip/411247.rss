    <title>Help with source files ip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-source-files-ip/411247</link>
    <description>Okay, so i made a rsps and i have been trying to put it on the internet for my friends to play. I know your supposed to make the ip in the client that you use to be set to 127.0.0.1, and the one u give out to your no-ip.org ip. but what ip do i make the source to be?

okay. well I tried reseraching what was goin on cause i my self or others couldn&#39;t connect to my server. so i looked on moparscape. and some body said to make the ip of the client you use to be 127.0.0.1 and the one you put up for others to download to be your no-ip. so i did all that. and know i need to know what i should make the ip for the source files. i have the client files ip what it said. just not the source. i still get a &quot;error connecting to server&quot; message. the ip i put in the source files was my actual ip. any ideas? do i make the ip in the source files my no-ip address? or my real ip? or 127.0.0.1?

-Thanks

              <p>what about the no-ip address?</p>
<p>btw. this is all i found when i searched server in the client.java that had anything to do with ip addresses.</p>
<p>Gui.server = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "New Server IP: ", “New Server IP”, 1);</p>
<p>should i chang “new server ip” to my actual ip?</p>
