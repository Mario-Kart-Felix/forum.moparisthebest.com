    <title>Reseting runescape account data</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/reseting-runescape-account-data/431918</link>
    <description>So I recently got 2 accounts as donations on my server and I want to reset the accounts information.

It sounds weird on what I&#39;m asking because I don&#39;t know how but I know it&#39;s possible because someone did it to my account when they stole it.

But there is a way to request jagex to remove all old information on the account.

Does anyone know how to do this?</description>

I see that in quite a few private servers still, surprisingly enough.  They don’t really care about keeping an actual sucsessful server, they just want to know what power feels like.</p>
