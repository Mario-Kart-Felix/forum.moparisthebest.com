    <title>Webclient - Jarred file fail [Will Rep+]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-jarred-file-fail-will-rep/416152</link>
    <description>I am currently working on a webclient. When I go to the not-jarred file and open the run.bat file it works perfect and doesn&#39;t give any errors. When I jar it and open it then it&#39;s downloading the cache, unpacking the cache, sets the background but then it says (after &quot;Connecting to update server&quot;):

[code]loaderror Connection to update server 60[/code]

After that message popped up the screen where the cache loads says:

[code]
Sorry, an error has occured whilst loading RuneScape

To fix this try the following (in order):

1: Remove any recently added media files from the client
2: Re-Extract your clients source and use it to connect
3: Make sure you have and are using Java V1_0_5 or better
4: Try rebooting your computer
5: Send an Email to Tornsouls@ymail.com for assistance
[/code]

Does anyone know how to fix this? [Will Rep+]</description>
