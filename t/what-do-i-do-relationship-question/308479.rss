    <title>What do I do? [Relationship question]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-i-do-relationship-question/308479</link>
    <description>So I REALLY like this girl that goes to my school, we like the same music and talk often to each other, but I&#39;m afraid she doesn&#39;t like me. I&#39;ve been rejected many times, the only thing I see wrong with me is the acne but it&#39;s not severe but it&#39;s sort of out of hand. We&#39;re friends right now, and I asked one of her good friends how the girl felt about me, and she said that she doesn&#39;t like anyone right now so hopefully I&#39;ll have a chance with her. She used to think I was crazy/weird, but I think that now that she&#39;s getting to know me, her thoughts of me are beginning to change. Should I wait a while longer (Couple weeks/months) to tell her how I feel about her? Or do I tell her now?</description>

How do you actually know she thought you were crazy?</p>
<p>Anyways, Just go for it. Don’t wait around cause I bet someone else will ask her out, then you will be unhappy, It’s best to tell her how you feel. You never know she might secretly like you.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What happened to me when I didn’t tell a girl how I feel:</span><br>
I liked a girl for a long time, we we’re good friends, she classed me as her “best friend”. I didn’t want to ask her out cause I thought it would ruin our friendship. Next thing I know, she goes out with my other best friend (He knew I liked her).</p>
<p>Anyways, they broke up and me and her got closer. School ends for the year and we hang out over the holidays. Durring the holidays she text me saying that she loves me and shit, I was beginning to think this was actually going somewhere. Everything was cool over the holidays, We go back to school, (the previous year she was in my class) this year, different classes, we remain friends. Then after two semesters she approaches me in tears saying shes moving away… I was shocked… I wished I asked her out/spent more time with her over the two semesters (I was with other people at school). Two weeks later she moves away. I never saw her again. I hardly even text her anymore either (She has really bad reception cause it’s like right up north of new zealand.)</p>
<p>So anyways, You don’t want to end up like me. Lol. (This all happened earlier this year.)<br>
