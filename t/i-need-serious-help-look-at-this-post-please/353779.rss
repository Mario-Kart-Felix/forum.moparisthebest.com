    <description>Well, I&#39;m new to all this, and I had a few questions.

I can&#39;t find the client.java in my server folder. I used the testscape source and I want to change what it says, and add commands and stuff. Also I want to know how to make accounts admins and mods. Can I get any help please?</description>
