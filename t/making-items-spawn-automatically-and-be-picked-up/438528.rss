    <description>I have spent the last hour or so pouring over the forum looking at, what seems to be HUGE delta issue. Seems no one&#39;s globaldrop.cfg pages are not recognized, thus the item spawning does not happen. I myself am having a similar issue, and was wondering if there was any way of fixing this? I know there is only one other page that handles the globaldrop.cfg, and that is itemhandler.java. In there I discovered this code (The only place globaldrop is found in the entire server (With a check))

[code]

	public ItemHandler() {
		for (int i = 0; i &lt;= 5000; i++) {
			globalItemController[i] = 0;
			globalItemID[i] = 0;
			globalItemX[i] = 0;
			globalItemY[i] = 0;
			globalItemAmount[i] = 0;
			globalItemTicks[i] = 0;
			globalItemStatic[i] = false;
		}
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; MaxDropItems; i++) {
			ResetItem(i);
		}
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; MaxListedItems; i++) {
			ItemList[i] = null;
		}
		loadItemList(&quot;item.cfg&quot;);
		loadDrops(&quot;globaldrops.cfg&quot;);
	}[/code]

Kind of lost on why it does not make them spawn where they should. Unlike a lot of the people in the same confusion, I get no error in the page loading. All my cfg&#39;s seemingly load just fine. Is there something in client that would make it work?

For the Delta peeps, who are experiencing the same issue. There is a temp fix that can help you out, but should only be reserved for absolute must drop items (Quest related etc) as it takes client space:

Am going to give and example for the Light Orb required in the Underground Passage. 
First open client.java, and search for process()

Under it code this:
[code]

			if (absX &gt;= 2417 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2418) {
			if (absY &gt;= 9682 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9682) {
			if (q7 == 1) {
			createGroundItem(1481, 2416, 9696, 1);
			}
		}
	}[/code]
What this will tell it to do is as you pass this particular coord set
[code]if (absX &gt;= 2417 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 2418) {
			if (absY &gt;= 9682 &amp;&amp; absY &lt;= 9682) {[/code]
The item will spawn at said location decided by
[code]createGroundItem(1481, 2416, 9696, 1);[/code]

Now do a search for
[code]case 236: //pickup item[/code]
Under it somewhere code this:
[code]

			if (itemID == 1481 &amp;&amp; itemX == 2416 &amp;&amp; itemY == 9696 &amp;&amp; !playerHasItem(1481, 1)) {
			addItem(1481, 1);
			ItemHandler.removeItemAll(1481, 2416, 9696);
			}[/code]
What this first part does, is allows the item you spawn earlier to provide YOU with the item when clicked, providing you do not already have it
[code]if (itemID == 1481 &amp;&amp; itemX == 2416 &amp;&amp; itemY == 9696 &amp;&amp; !playerHasItem(1481, 1)) {
			addItem(1481, 1);[/code]

The final part removes the item from the game when you take it. 
[code]ItemHandler.removeItemAll(1481, 2416, 9696);
			}[/code]
As I said before though....this is only a temporary fix to the globaldrop issue. I am working on figuring out why globaldrops do not occur as they should. As soon as I can get it triggered, I will post out a tutorial for all other deltas. Anyone else want to try and contribute to making item spawning work?</description>

<p>we all know there is a autospawn.cfg. And for everyone I know of it works.<br>
A theory for making the item dropping work is this:</p>
<p>For autospawn in Client.java I have this:</p>
<p>[code]<br>
public void appendToAutoSpawn(int npcid, int absx, int absy) {<br>
BufferedWriter bw = null;</p>
<pre><code>	try {
		bw = new BufferedWriter(
				new FileWriter("config//autospawncodes.txt", true));
		bw.write("spawn = "+npcid+"	"+absx+"	"+absy+"	0	0	0	0	0	1");
		bw.newLine();
		bw.flush();
	} catch (IOException ioe) {
		ioe.printStackTrace();
	} finally {
		if (bw != null) {
			try {
				bw.close();
			} catch (IOException ioe2) {
				sM("Error autospawning!");
			}
		}
	}

}
public void appendToAutoSpawn2(int npcid, int absx, int absy, int absx2, int absy2, int absx3, int absy3) {
	BufferedWriter bw = null;

	try {
		bw = new BufferedWriter(
				new FileWriter("config//autospawncodes.txt", true));
		bw.write("spawn = "+npcid+"	"+absx+"	"+absy+"	0	"+absx2+"	"+absy2+"	"+absx3+"	"+absy3+"	1");
		bw.newLine();
		bw.flush();
	} catch (IOException ioe) {
		ioe.printStackTrace();
	} finally {
		if (bw != null) {
			try {
				bw.close();
			} catch (IOException ioe2) {
				sM("Error autospawning!");
			}
		}
	}

}[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>I am safely assuming this is what makes them pop up where they are supposed to via the cfg page. My theory is to copy simply add this code, changing everything “autospawn” to “globaldrops” and editing the parts of the string that need to be edited. If not this, then perhaps copying the code, and the autospawn.cfg. Change the name to something like itemspawn.cfg, and change the “npc” in the code above to “item”.</p>
<p>Side note. The temp thing can also be done via clicking objects, using items on objects, dialogues, etc. I believe this is a means of making “Global Drops” happen in “quest only” scenarios…just a theory <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
