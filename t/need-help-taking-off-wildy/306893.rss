    <title>Need Help Taking Off Wildy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-taking-off-wildy/306893</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using an allstar based server, and I know what 75% of you will say (&quot;this source sucks&quot;, &quot;YOU ARE RETARD3D!!&quot;) But I&#39;m here for help so if you are going to get off-topic like that and waste your time you clearly have no life. Anyways, back to my problem, as you may know allstar has most of the unused chunks of runescape as wildy, well, I found a nice place to make a new home with and I&#39;d like to know how to take the wildy off of this location. This may be very basic but I am pretty ignorant with coding as I have started about a few days ago, so some help would be nice.  ;D</description>
