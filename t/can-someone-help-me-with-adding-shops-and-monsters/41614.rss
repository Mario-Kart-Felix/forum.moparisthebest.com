          <blockquote>
              <p>adding monsters is quite simple, open autospawn.cgf and at the bottom you will see [end of spawn list] right before that write:</p>
<p>spawn = (NPC ID) XCoord YCoord Height (if its just on the ground put 0, if it like on the second floor of a house put 1 etc.) Range1X Range1Y Range2X Range2Y Rage= how far they may walk or move) There walk type ( just put 2 for people, 1 for Monsters) and a discribtion ;D</p>
<p>Hope that helped ;D</p>
