    <title>Client Trouble - New Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-trouble-new-client/32874</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve spent the last month or so working on a custom client for my server which no one knows about or has been on because I’m keeping it under wraps until it&#39;s finished...

Though I have had no problems with it since now.

On starting the client, all runs fine.

Start server, all runes fine

Log into server. client crashes and gives me this excuse.

[size=10pt][tt]Loading Can’tTellYouTheNameScape...
i3: -1
Exception in thread &quot;Thread-3&quot; java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space[/tt][/size]

I have tried many ways to sort it but it is still wrapped up in my head and I cannot cure it. can any of the more &quot;professional&quot; people that have been working on clients longer then me (roughly 5 months) help me out here?

Like, explain what could possibly be causing this error when I log on and how to cure it so I can continue to test my server.</description>
