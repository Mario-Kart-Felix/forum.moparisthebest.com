    <description>I am in need for a great Photoshop user, not someone who is pro at GFX but someone who is pro at editing IRL pictures, here is the problem, We took a picture with a famous country singer Justin Moore, we as me and my GF, well the picture was taken in the moment of her either blinking or un-blinking so her eyes are squinched, i need someone to edit that for me so it looks normal. Hope someone here can help me!</description>

<p>Are you serious… Its probably the easiest and most efficient way of doing it. Obviously you’re going to need to blend the new eyes with the face but it can be done in 30 seconds. I’ve been using photoshop for years now and I’ve been in a photography class for a year now so when I suggest it can be done this way then it can be done this way.</p>

<p>I get what you were saying now, i thought u ment just crop a face out and place it over it.  The thing is her eyes arent closed, but there not open. there in the process of blinking so its in between, TALK ABOUT BAD LUCK! we got it fixed though</p>
