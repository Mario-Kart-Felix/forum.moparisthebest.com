    <title>I almost died 50 different times today</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-almost-died-50-different-times-today/331628</link>
    <description>Well apparently half my fucking city is retarded. Heres what happened.

Today I went to get my sisters from school at about 4pm or 16:00. Im leaving the school and it comes up to a road. You can ethier go left or right and there is a stop light. The traffic was pretty congested and apparently people here don&#39;t look at stop lights to figure out wether to stop or not, they look at the person in front of them and see if they are continuing through the light or not. Im at the turn where you can ethier go left or right and im going left and waiting at the stop light. The light turns green but guess what traffic is still going on through from left to right. I was in fucking awe as I see the cars keep going through. At first I thought the stop light was broken and all lights were green but guess what, IT WASN&#39;T! I look to the right and the light is red but still fucking mentally handicapped twats continue to go through the light. So I wait and wait. My light turns red and im stuck. This contiunes on for about 4 more red green cycles until some fucking brillant mother fucker figures out that the light is red and he stops. Finally I can fucking go after about 10 minutes of waiting. I dont think ive ever seen anything so fucking stupid in my life. I could babysit 1000 retards and it wouldn&#39;t amount to the stupidness I witnessed today. If I would have went when my light was green I would be fucking dead. Yes currently im raging. One good think is that I figured out how fast my vehicle can go from 0 to 80mph. Becuase when they stopped fucking driving. I put that fucking pedal to the ground and took off (road rage). Thoughts? Yes this in America.</description>

<p>Ahem, I lived in southern states and I drive just fine. Actually, better than most driving instructors where I currently live.

weird, is that for a general license? you’d only have to do that here if it was a specialized license, for truck drivers etc…</p>

<p>Adding the fact that they are already riding bumper to bumper in heavy traffic in a 45 mile speed limit zone already going 5 over me pulling out in front would be like trying to get in front of the side of a train. Causing a mass chain reaction of accidents.</p>
