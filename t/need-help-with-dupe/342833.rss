              <p>Well,<br>
if you really can’t fix the duping, I would recommend using the ISP Ban method, he can only get online with other internet provider then. (Also if he is using friends computer etc)</p>
<p>Just ban his main acc (Not ip ban, just ban) + ISP Ban him if he is making another account.<br>
Makes him banned on his main for ever (On other computers too) &amp; ISP Banned for his whole house.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>If he is using the trade dupe the go into your command logs (if you have them) and find the command that he is using to disconnect himself. For example if he was using a command called ::dupe and that command did not exist in your client.java file then you could add it. In this example the command previously used to dupe items would now empty the players inventory and tele them into high level wilderness agility course (Where they cant escape from without dieing or clipping out).</p>
<p>if (command.startsWith(“dupe”)) {<br>
removeAllItems();<br>
triggerTele(3003, 3934, 0);<br>
}</p>
<p>If you wanted you could spice things up a bit by adding an aggressive NPC to the place where the duper is teleported  to make sure the job was finished.</p>
<p>If you cannot access a commands log then you can either stay on-line watching your server cmd screen to see what commands he uses or much more effectively try adding a timer to the trade screen. If you add a timer to the trade screen when the duper disconnects they will still appear on-line for a while allowing the system to cancel the trade.</p>
<p>If none of this helps then I cant really suggest anything other than disabling duelling. Hope this helped <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>one major dupe that works on almost all servers is noted runes, 7555 are noted fire runes, and can be spawned freely, but then when banked and taken back out, they are the actual fire rune, my advice would be to make sure every noted item has a price that is the same as the un-noted version.  I hope this helps  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
