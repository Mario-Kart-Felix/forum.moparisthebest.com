    <description>Blast From The Past

This movie was very enjoyable and comic. It was about this family&#39;s house which, in the 1960s, was destroyed by a plane crash. The father (Christopher Walken), who made a bomb shelter with litterally everything in it to last for 35 years for 3 people to avoid a nuclear explosion, immediately took his pregnant wife and ran into the bunker. As soon as he closed the doors, the timer set itself to 35 years and that&#39;s when it would unlock itself. It was impossible to unlock until that time period.

After about two weeks while living in the bunker, the mother gave birth to Adam (Brendan Fraser). He was taught by his father about life, dancing, boxing, games, literature, history, arts, different languages, and many more things. When the years passed by and after a total of 35 years, the bunker finally let them out. The father, being the strong one in the family, checked it out and apparently went out into the streets at night where he saw wackos and prostitutes. He assumed they were mutants as a side effect from the radiation and declared it unsafe to go there.

They had run out of food, and asked their son to go up and find some food and other useful supplies. The son, at now the age of 35, said alright and promised he would be back soon. He went up there and I don&#39;t want to ruin it for you, but it&#39;s hilarious. This is only the beginning and there is much more of it. 

If you have never heard of Brendan Fraser, he is an actor who starred in many films such as Bedazzled, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, and on numerous episodes of King of the Hill.
