    <description>hey, it may seem like a stupid question but people learn by doing no? if i were to play around with codes and look up how to do different thing on a 307 or 508 could i learn how to code a server? I can code html5 and css3 pretry well, no pro but getting there, could i do it? thanks.

              <p><span class="mention">@op</span>: i’m not sure why you want to learn java by programming rsps’s :P. but to answer your question, yes you can. however, you must learn the code and what its function is in order to be successful. i’d suggest downloading some ‘how-to’ docs. i believe there’s a post on here somewhere, cba to find it, called learn java in X days. you should try looking for it.</p>

<p>Okay, I see you have no programming knowledge.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a client sided scripting language for <span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">websites</span></span>.<br>
Java is a programming language used to develop applications.</p>
<p>They are both two different languages. You might be wonder why JavaScript has Java in the same, that is because JavaScript was built using Java.</p>
<p>I’d recommend you look up the bare basics of the language, this will help you a lot. There are many books, videos etc., teaching you Java online.</p>
