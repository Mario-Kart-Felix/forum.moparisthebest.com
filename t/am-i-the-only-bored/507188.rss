    <title>Am I the only bored?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/am-i-the-only-bored/507188</link>
    <description>Below is a explanation of

The game isn&#39;t the same. Starting my memberships I knew it wouldn&#39;t be the same game and it will never be. The player base is smarter, there are still more unused areas than ever, bots are coming back strong, and [b]there aren&#39;t any rare items[/b]. There&#39;s a lot of new content in the game that I just hate, and I remembered it being way better in 2006. The first week of release, all I could think about was RuneScape and how much fun I was going to have, but now two weeks have gone by and I&#39;m very bored.


Rare items were a HUGE part of the game for me during the prime of RS. It gave you something to work for, if you had a partyhat you [i]were[/i] better than the player who didn&#39;t. Yeah, whips and barrows are rare but eventually those will become more common.


There&#39;s content in the game that does not belong with this &quot;old school&quot; era. What people don&#39;t understand about the newer content is the graphic style, the models made in 2007-2008 were foreshadowing the HD update and keeping them in the game now only throws off &#39;the graphical balance&#39; of the game. (I don&#39;t like the new Varrock and I can&#39;t stand the current GameFrame).


Which all some how tie together with me being bored. I am hopeful for the weekly content polls Jagex will be giving us which is all I can hope for really. As my nostalgia dies, so does the game.</description>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, thats one thing I have noticed with this time of revision<br>
its like semi old school, or a hybrid between hd and oldschool, because of some updated npc models, and new places like varrock etc<br>
Honestly it just doesnt look good with it, there isnt that many models they’d need to change to take it back completely, other than varrock that may take a bit of time I don’t see a problem with stuff like changing dragons, wolfs, demons, varrock guards, varrock in general (including the fountain :o), giants, so on so forth</p>
<p>But other than that really its pretty fun to me at least</p>

<p>Anyhow, I played a lot when it first came out but I simply do not have the interest to play. I tried to play legit and not for gold but that lasted about two days before I started selling, and since the price is mud now I’m not even bothering. However, I do plan on playing a fair bit over summer. I would really like to max my stats and hopefully I’ll have more interest.</p>

<p>If 1/10 of the population has a magic seed… then that’s a lot of magic seeds in the game. If inflation was natural they would be cheap right now but everyone already knows the value of that item.

              <p>[quote=“Rodgerwilco, post:6, topic:507188”]It’s frustrating because new people are in charge on the game now (the people who have whips, mills, etc etc). The problem is everyone already knows how to ‘tackle’ the game. Which is why I decided to create that clan to shift rolls and make things more efficient (which the top guys did with no lives). Everyone knows a magic seed is going to be 100k (although us farmers don’t really care for them) people still are stuck on the old prices.</p>
<p>Back in the day it wasn’t really this greedy. I use to give out free law runes to people in need, answer questions, and sometimes let the person I am about to kill get away. Since people already know what to expect they become greedy bastards.</p>
<p>The thrill of the game (to me) is pking. Always has been, always will be. In rs2, pking does suck because again… everyone knows what to expect. It sucks because I predict peoples moves so easily that I hardly die, which becomes boring. Oh here he goes with the dspec, if he hits good he will try again after I eat my shark. Everyone knows how to create a pure which really defeats the purpose. I remember back in rsc I had no clue what a monk pure was. I really wish those monk pures were still around. They are awesome.[/quote]I’ve told you why Magic Seeds are “high priced”, that’s the HARDEST seed to get in the game aside Spirit Tree. Of course people are going to sell them for higher prices, growing your own magic tree when magic logs are 1.5kea? And I highly disagree with the predictable pking and how <span class="bbcode-b">you</span> never die. I mean yeah you never die if you eat above half health and eat when they spec.</p>

              <p>I tend to agree also. I have no problem with the EoC and had no real plans to leave it but I did make a new account to test out the 2007 servers and see how it goes. After the first couple of days I lost a great deal of interest due to not a lot being in the game. Sure pking will be fun and all but like what was already said it gets predictable when you’ve been doing it for years prior. Not saying I knew this was going to happen but when  a lot of people started planning out “strategies” on how to play the new servers it all sounded like a bad idea.</p>

I’ll usually be found cutting maples, and then periodically wander off and start chatting with either friends or people in banks.<br>
Though, I really don’t feel worthy of complaining, considering Jagex had actually managed to give us what we had wanted all along; an ‘oldschool’ era of the game.<br>
Now, seeing that you miss rares being incorporated into the game, I can’t say that I can agree completely. They always gave a very public air of cockiness which I didn’t always appreciate. Yet, for them to be back into the game would give me something to work for.</p>
