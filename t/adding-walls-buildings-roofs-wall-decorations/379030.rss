    <title>Adding walls, buildings, roofs, wall decorations?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-walls-buildings-roofs-wall-decorations/379030</link>
    <description>in my source, it says the object types are this:
[code]ObjectType:
0-3 wall objects
4-8 wall decoration
9: diag.walls
10-11 world objects
12-21: roofs
22: floor decoration[/code]

but i made a range of objects using each object type, and only those with 10 and 11 showed up.
Does the object have to be designed for the specific type or something?
all help would be appreciated.</description>
