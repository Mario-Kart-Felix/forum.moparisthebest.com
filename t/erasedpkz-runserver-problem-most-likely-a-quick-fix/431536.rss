    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/erasedpkz-runserver-problem-most-likely-a-quick-fix/431536</link>
    <description>Well, i&#39;ve edited an erasedpkz source as much as i could think of, and now when i run it in the morning before school, it looks fine. When i get home, it looks like this http://prntscr.com/5ta1y . but it&#39;s still online...it doesnt cause anything, just wanting to know if i can stop the cmd from doing that?</description>
