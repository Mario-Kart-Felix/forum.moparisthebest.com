              <p>[quote=“runescape sucks, post:2, topic:544666”]First Name, Last Name: I’ll tell you later<br>
Age: 16<br>
Sex: Male<br>
Country: U.S. (Central Time)<br>
How long have you been on the field, you’re signing up for: Since 2006-2007 probably.<br>
Why should you be part of the team?(Write at-least 4 sentences): What is this an essay? I’m only doing this because I think i would be fun to do, really. Why are you even asking me for this reason for joining? Will it really help your evaluation of how good I am for this team? If you want a full answer, then I will say that I want to be apart of this ‘team’ because it is open for positions.<br>
Contact(Email only): I’ll tell you later.<br>
Any previous work?(Images, or proof of some sort): What do you want me to show you a picture of? A server? A picture of the code? If you want to see some of my work, challenge me with something to program, don’t ask for my previous work because the only things I can show you that are online are terrible.</p>
<p>Umm. A remake? I’m assuming it’s 2006 because that’s what everyone else is trying to do. Anyways, what’s with the personal details for your application.</p>
<p>Name, sex, and country are kind of a bit too much to ask. It’s just not useful information really, country maybe, but timezone would be better. Name and sex have nothing to do with it, I could literally enter anything into these fields and it won’t matter because we won’t meet in person or anything like that.</p>
<p>Oh, and also you are not even asking what they’re trying to sign up for. And this is a serious application, not a troll.[/quote]</p>
<p>Sorry about the late response, was very busy.</p>
