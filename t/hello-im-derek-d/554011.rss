    <title>Hello, I&#39;m Derek :D</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-im-derek-d/554011</link>
    <description>Hello Moparians.

I&#39;m Derek. Figured my first post should be an introduction since I&#39;m going to be posting a lot and you&#39;re going to be wishing I never even registered after lurking for years

I&#39;m 24 years old, from West Virginia, United States - And I&#39;ve come here because I recently decided I want to learn to code RSPS since I dabble in java script. I came in in search for a server to download so I can begin the learning process, as I am self-taught with everything I know (playing guitar was easy to learn, and so was building and maintaining computers. Coding is turning out to be a bit more complicated and sometimes I wish I had a tutor lol). So I decided to go ahead and register so I can ask questions and hopefully answer a few myself. I am a complete beginner though. I&#39;ve picked up a few things since I started this journey 2 days ago but none the less, there is tons I dont know. 
On a scale of 1-10 - 10 being a person who can fix just about any problem and can build a server, framework and all, from the ground up, and with 0 being someone who has never heard of Eclipse/NetBeans, a .bat file or a compiler - I&#39;d say I&#39;m somewhere around a 2.9 at the moment.

I have no desire to host a server. I have no desire to let other people play on a server made my someone else and edited by me - I have no desire to make money off of an underground sub-culture of a British RPG that I&#39;ve played for over 11 year (rs obvlsly) - I have no desires other than to learn how to code and troubleshoot - how to code and troubleshoot well so I can be of help to the developer of the server I am currently playing or any server I may play in the future. If I learn enough and get good enough to build my own server from scratch without the help or code from anyone else, then yes - I might host. But that will probably never happen and if it does, it will be years from now because I dont believe in hosting a server that you didn&#39;t make yourself. I am a musician, so you can imagine where mindset comes from with bands stealing lyrics or guitar riffs from other bands and making money from doing it.

I was going to post a picture of myself but I&#39;m not sure if this site uses BBCode, Html or what... Maybe i&#39;ll get to that later.
Anyway, just wanted to do this the right way. Now, on to the rs2 client downloads section so I can ask for help hahaha.</description>
