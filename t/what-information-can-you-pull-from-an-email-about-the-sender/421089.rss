    <title>What information can you pull from an email about the sender?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-information-can-you-pull-from-an-email-about-the-sender/421089</link>
    <description>I have a client that needs to know if the person that is sending him an email is really who this person says he or she is.

Ive been able to get an IP and a computer username from the email but,

My client claims that this person is forwarding him back an email that he claims this other person is saying he sent them.

Is there anyway to verify that my client did or did not send this other person an email without looking at this other mans emails, which isn&#39;t possible.

Also before you start flaming me for taking on a job I wasn&#39;t very experienced with, before looking into this I told my client I probably wasn&#39;t going to be able to get much information from an email, and I wasn&#39;t very experienced with this but he still wanted me to look into it.</description>

              <p>If you receive an email, there is only 1 way to make sure it is from who it says it is from, and that is to reply to it (make sure a different reply-to email is NOT set, reply to the address you want to verify) and if they reply back quoting your reply, they have access to that email.</p>

<p>Email forwarding generically refers to the operation of re-sending an email message delivered to one email address to a possibly different email address(es). The term forwarding has no specific technical meaning, but it implies that the email has been moved "forward" to a new destination. Email forwarding can also redirect mail going to a certain address and send it to one or more other addresses. Vice versa, email items going to several different addresses can converge via forwarding to end up i...</p>
