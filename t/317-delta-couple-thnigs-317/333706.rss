              <ol>
<li>Try searching for tutorials for creating ranks, add a rank named “usedPure”<br>
then add this to your command:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(command.startsWith("pure") {
if(pure == 0){
[i]the exp giving part here[/i]
} else {
sM("You can only use this command once!");
}
}</code></pre>
<p>Please use both brackets at the end, else you will get 100 errors,</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>This is probably just your items in client, just spawn unnoted items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the PKP shop, there are plenty of Tut’s around, use Google</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, add a rank named “testKillcount”, you can change the name put you will need to change it everywhere in the next code too…<br>
Then go to your if(ObjectID == …){ code and make it like this:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(ObjectID == @@@@){ //replace @@@@ with object ID
if(testKillcount &gt;= 20){ //this will check if you have killed 20 or more monsters
[i]what you want your object to do if there is a 20 Killcount[/i]
} else { //else..
sM("You need 20 killcount before doing this!"); //tells player he needs 20 Kc
sM("You currently have " + testKillcount + " Killcount!"); //tells player current KC..
}
}</code></pre>
<p>Now for the killcount to work go to your NPCHandler class and search for “if(npcs[i].npcType ==”<br>
and right above that add this:</p>
<p><code>
if(npcs[i].npcType == ####){ //Replace #### with NPC ID
if(temp.gwdkc == 20) { //Checks if killcount is already 20
temp.sM("Your Killcount is already 20!"); //Tells player his killcount is already 20..
} else { //else..
temp.gwdkc += 1; //Adds his killcount +1 if the player has killed the NPC
temp.sM("Your Killcount is now: "+temp.testKillcount+"."); //this tells the player his current killcount
}
}</code></p>
<p>Note: Don’t remove the “temp.” this makes it so it happens after the NPC is killed</p>
<p>Also if you can’t work this out, I would say you need to learn some more Java first and retry later on… This is just really C+P</p>
