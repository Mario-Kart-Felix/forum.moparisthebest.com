<p>Obviously, though i’m not suggesting that. If someone is consistently contributing positive material to the community then give them a badge, if you feel they deserve a badge, PM a staff member with your recommendation and why.</p>
<p>I don’t have a clue where you got that i was suggesting giving an award for each and every post.</p>

              <p>[quote=“Thug-life, post:86, topic:288236”]Can’t you just remove rep?</p>
<p>I know it has been asked many times before, but i don’t see any positive impact on the community from it. If people deserve something like rep, then give them specific awards for what they have been doing in and around the community.</p>
<p>Example: Help and contribute enough to the linux section over a certain amount of time and you <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> me awarded a linux badge for it based on either, private recommendations (through pm) to staff or recommendations by staff. The only problem i can see with that, is that everyone already has 20 badges each on this forum now, but everyone has loads of rep so i suppose it isn’t really any different.</p>
<p>I don’t think rep-- is the solution, you’ll just see the so called “elitists” smiting everyone they’ve had a slight disagreement with, things go around on IRC and before you know it, that user has 0 rep.[/quote]</p>
<p>If we do the badge thing, then I suggest no member can have more than 3 awards at one time (staff badges not included). Honestly, some of the members here are very bright, but none of the people with 4-5 badges actually spend most of their programming/design time doing all of those fields at one time. People should only get awarded for things they publicly show they know. If someone spends their time making Java applications and releasing them here, they shouldn’t become a C Guru just because they know C. They should only become a C Guru if they spend equal or more time releasing C programs as Java programs.</p>
<p>Oh and, no awards should be given out to non-contributers, how else are we supposed to really know whether someone’s good at something? And maybe we could set up the system so that people can apply for badges. SMF 2.0 supports this, and globals would be able to approve/deny such requests. That system really opens up a lot of windows for future suggestions.</p>

Can’t you just remove rep?</p>
<p>I know it has been asked many times before, but i don’t see any positive impact on the community from it. If people deserve something like rep, then give them specific awards for what they have been doing in and around the community.</p>
<p>Example: Help and contribute enough to the linux section over a certain amount of time and you <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> me awarded a linux badge for it based on either, private recommendations (through pm) to staff or recommendations by staff. The only problem i can see with that, is that everyone already has 20 badges each on this forum now, but everyone has loads of rep so i suppose it isn’t really any different.</p>
<p>I don’t think rep-- is the solution, you’ll just see the so called “elitists” smiting everyone they’ve had a slight disagreement with, things go around on IRC and before you know it, that user has 0 rep.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree.  If we were to introduce rep–, there would need to be a limit on 1 rep-- per post, not per person, to attempt to avoid it.  However, rep-- would easily be abused if a user does not like another, therefore creating yet another corrupted system.[/quote]<a href="http://thebanhammer.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">B&amp;</a><br>

what about if you had certain awards that were only displayed within the profile? that way they arent cluttering up people’s posts</p>
