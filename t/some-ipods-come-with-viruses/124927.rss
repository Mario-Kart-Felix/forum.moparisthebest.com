    <title>Some iPods Come with Viruses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/some-ipods-come-with-viruses/124927</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Apple lovers rush to respond to the often asked question &quot;Why a Mac not a PC?&quot;, with a tilt to their head, a smile and the ever-loving response &quot;Because my Mac can&#39;t get a virus!&quot; This makes them feel feel all warm and fuzzy inside.

Well Mac lovers, say it ain&#39;t so, but the cross-pollination used by Apple to make the iPod available to the PC world has left some people with more than a warm and fuzzy feeling. That&#39;s right, they&#39;ve got themselves a virus.

According to Apple less than 1% of video iPods sold after September 12 were shipped with the RavMonE virus. Although not harmful for you Apple users....please gloat here....you PC users might find a nasty little thing growing inside of your desktop that opens the door to even worse baddies.

Now, this is not the end of the world, but the finger pointing has begun between Apple and Microsoft as who should be to blame. Apple says it is the fault of the Windows based computer they used to manufacture the iPods and Microsoft says it is Apple&#39;s fault for not protecting the computer in the first place.

Either way, the virus can be removed if you have anything resembling an anti-virus program....much easier than trying to beat the clap, right?

Plus, PC users can finally gloat that they aren&#39;t the only one with a virus....wait, that came out wrong...or did it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
