    <description>Alright I am still working on this. This is the beginning of it. There are 3 different images and right now the light is not right and I still need to do alot of blending. Anyways here is what I have now. The image also looks fake so I need to redo it a little more. This is not complete. btw I need more tutorials and stuff on how to get more realistic lighting/blending. Also anything that will help me will be good :). I still suck horribly but yea. For some odd reason it looks a lot better on photoshop then here.

              <p>If you are doing HDR, like STH said, it’s a start. But if you aren’t try a pink/lavender grad set to about 39% opacity, and that should blend the color. And make it look more like a real photograph of a landscape at sunrise.</p>

              <p>Looks a bit like my HDR Photography, but I’m guessing that’s because it kinda is what you’re doing, with three different images.</p>
