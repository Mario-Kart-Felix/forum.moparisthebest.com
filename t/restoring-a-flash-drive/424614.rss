    <title>Restoring a flash drive</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/restoring-a-flash-drive/424614</link>
    <description>I just plugged my flash drive into my windows computer to place my server backup on it when everything on it was erased. I have photos on there that are from 1999 - 2003. Those pictures were on an older computer that I was thinking about resetting and selling but thank God I didn&#39;t. All that saved was 1 .zip file and its empty. The flash drive says there&#39;s only 600MB of space out of 4GB left, which is how it was before anything was deleted. Norton (don&#39;t comment about norton, it came with my computer as a free 60 day full trial thing, I don&#39;t see why not) wanted to scan the folder so I say okay whatever and it says it found a virus, which was the server restarter of course, and asked to remove it. I clicked yes, it&#39;s just an auto-restarter who cares if I lose it. It resets everything.. I plug the flash drive into my Ubuntu computer and it finds a folder with over 8,000 files in it that I can&#39;t see on Windows. So yeah, is there any way to restore a flash drive? Thanks.</description>

<p>The whole thing is fucked up.<br>
Is there any way to completely reset the flash drive? I deleted everything on it and it still says only 600MB of free space out of 4GB.</p>
