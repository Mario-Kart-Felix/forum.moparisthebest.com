    <title>Sprite Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sprite-question/299264</link>
    <description>Hey guys, i figured out how to add inventory sprites, however i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me with the moving part of it. For example, a new armor with different looks, designed in every camera angel. How could i add this in there? Thanks again everyone.</description>

<p>I appreciate that rocky, i understood what you ment. I did what you told me and found some information. However i’m not sure how to apply it. I saw how the x-shift and y-shift along with the width and height were all set. However, when i try and set them, it doesn’t work. i’ll save the .png image as a spr file with me changing the settings, then i’ll load that sprite to see if the settings were what i changed them to. And they are back to default. Then i go Load sprite&gt; adjust settings&gt; save sprite&gt; refresh&gt; clear&gt; load again to see if settings took, and still nothing. If you have msn that would be awesome for some further help. thanks again.</p>

<p>Refresh before saving as spr will save your shifts and such…</p>

              <p>Not a problem at all.</p>
<p>What exactly do you want them to do? Is it not displaying correctly, how did you pack the sprites? Sorry if I don’t understand, I’m not quite sure how you want it to work. Perhaps in the Sprite Editor, you set the size, shift values, or id wrong? Also, be sure that when you change a sprite, click on ‘Refresh’ to make sure it saves the edits you made to the sprite. I’d suggest looking at other sprites to get an idea on how to set the shift values and size.</p>
<p>If you need me to explain more thoroughly, I’ll be glad to do so.</p>

<p>-On topic, i edited all the sprites, but i need to know how to make them all work. When i pack them and everything and i wield the item, it doesnt do what i want it to do. So is there more that i have to code? or is there a certain way i have to pack it? Thanks again</p>

              <p>Its the same way you would do it with the inventory sprites, only there are more sprites to edit.</p>
<p>Btw, this topic should be posted in the Server and Client Help section, so in future, ask your questions there.</p>
