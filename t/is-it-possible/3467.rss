    <title>Is it possible</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible/3467</link>
    <description>My account got hacked and stolen(after my brother downloaded a keylogger), the pass was changed and I couldn&#39;t get it through recovery questions because when I made them the answers to them were just other passwords and stuff and I don&#39;t remember it. So, is it possible to hack my account back, by using a brute force thingy program I have to get my password back (or something like that) or does that not work for the java thing. I dont know much so is there anyway I can get my account back at all, its a high level and I can&#39;t just remake this account. :confused: remember I&#39;m stupid at computers.</description>

              <p>On top of that, we don’t support any type of password cracking as we don’t know if it is being used the way you say it will be used. I’m not sure if this has explained here, but thats the way it used to go at kaitnieks.</p>

              <p>Yes, you could bruteforce a runescape account. First you would need to disable the login attempt limit, then if you weren’t detected you could use a cracker to try as many passwords as possible. By the time you got into your account you could have created one just as good.</p>
