    <title>Is it possible?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible/384577</link>
    <description>Do you think like, i dont know how to explain this, lets say members have a higher priority of selling things than F2P

example:

One person puts 100 air runes to buy in the ge (f2p) at 10 gp each

Another person puts the same amount in for the same price to buy, but is P2P

The F2P person put in the offer an hour before the P2P player, but when someone sold 100 air runes at 10gp, the P2P player got it.

Do you think this is what jagex does? Like P2P players have a higher chance of buying or selling things than a f2p player?

<p>yeah, but they may not be telling us, i havent tested this or anything yet, nor do i know any item or price i can do this on, but you never know… Plus i would actually expect this from jagex, because they “LUVZ DER MONEH”.<br>

<p>I wouldn’t understand why they would have that feature without telling people. If they had this, wouldn’t you want to mention it to F2P players to try and persuade them even further to buy membership?[/quote]<br>
