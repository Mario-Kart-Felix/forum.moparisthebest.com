    <title>Is it possible?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible/39136</link>
    <description>is it possible to make a script to run laws from draynor to entrana? i have an idea on how to find the people who craft the laws.  here it is: first u have to run the laws manually once and find out the names of the people who craft the laws. then get the color of the zammy robes and have the script search for color then name if result is true then procede with trade. does this sound plausable? cuz i think everyone would really enjoy this!(at least members would =p)</description>

              <p>Yess all those things are possible with SRL, But the long walk walk make the script buggy and annoying to make.</p>
<p>finding the people to trade with and accepting the trades would be a doddle.</p>
