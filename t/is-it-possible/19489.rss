    <title>Is it possible?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible/19489</link>
    <description>Ok we all know there is a ::npc command to spawn a npc. What i think is that if there was a save command to save everything even stuff thats in gameplay then since there was npcs spawned normally the server wouldnt know what to do with them so it would delete them but if u could make a command to tell the server to save  their walktype and coords in a certain file (autospawn.cfg) this would speed up the process of adding npcs.

anybody else think so ?

anybody wanna help build?</description>
