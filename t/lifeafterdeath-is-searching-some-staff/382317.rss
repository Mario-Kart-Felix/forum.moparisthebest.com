    <title>LifeAfterDeath is searching some Staff!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lifeafterdeath-is-searching-some-staff/382317</link>
    <description>Hey!

I am creating a new server called LifeAfterDeath. Unforunately, I cannot host. Therefore, I would want to find someone who possibly has a VPS and that could host this server. Props of the job:

- You&#39;re given the rank of owner
- You participate and have a veto right in all server activities
- 100% of donations (my estimations are 50$ after 1st month and 150$ per month after) go to you. I do not ask any at all.

If you want to be hoster, please fill in the following:

Age:
Country:
VPS capacity:


Server will be based either off Devolution or maybe Delta. Anyways, it will be completely different to any server, since I intend to make a lot of changes.


Also, I need a coder. I am a pretty good coder myself, but I would want another coder, who is good with clients, to support me in case I have a problem. If you want to be a part of the team, please fill in the following:

Age:
Country:
Experience:
Past accomplishments(optionnal):



Mods will be chosen based on activity on server and respect of others and of the rules.


Thanks,

Vrac</description>
