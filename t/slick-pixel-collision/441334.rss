    <title>Slick - Pixel Collision</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/slick-pixel-collision/441334</link>
    <description>I&#39;m making a game using the Slick API and I&#39;m having trouble detecting if an image is touching another image. The problem is that the sprites have transparent parts which the code should not trigger collision. There was this RGB thing I was reading about but I don&#39;t understand computer colors. Not sure what transparency was. \

How can I do this?

Also is there a FAST way to make PNG files transparent without Photoshop / online software?

Thanks,
Whac</description>

<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/DbK677qW%5B/quote%5Draw" rel="nofollow noopener">http://pastebin.com/DbK677qW[/quote]raw</a> pixel overlap comparison is a poor way of doing this, especially when you consider the performance problems you’ll encounter if you want lots of collisions (it should suffice for smaller numbers of colliding entities however). what i would suggest reading about is collision bitmasks and representing the collision boundaries as a logical matrix for much faster collision detection through bitwise operations.</p>
<p>OP you may actually find yourself learning something if you attempt to learn how colours are represented by the computer, rather than dismissing them on the grounds that you don’t understand them (it’s called initiative, i suggest you take it).</p>

<p>The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue. The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography.

<p>In the field of optics, transparency (also called pellucidity or diaphaneity) is the physical property of allowing light to pass through the material without being scattered. On a macroscopic scale (one where the dimensions investigated are much, much larger than the wavelength of the photons in question), the photons can be said to follow Snell's Law. Translucency (also called translucence or translucidity) is a superset of transparency: it allows light to pass through, but does not necessarily ...</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_%28graphic%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Transparency (graphic)</a></h3>

<p>Transparency is possible in a number of graphics file formats. The term transparency is used in various ways by different people, but at its simplest there is "full transparency" i.e. something that is completely invisible. Only part of a graphic should be fully transparent, or there would be nothing to see. More complex is "partial transparency" or "translucency" where the effect is achieved that a graphic is partially transparent in the same way as colored glass. Since ultimately a printed page...</p>

<p>also look up transparency masks (runtime conversion of an image’s instances of a certain colour to transparency). a good simple program that allows you to work with transparency in images is <a href="http://Paint.NET" rel="nofollow noopener">Paint.NET</a></p>
