    <title>My New Mysticism Skill - The Level Won&#39;t Refresh</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-new-mysticism-skill-the-level-wont-refresh/45293</link>
    <description>Aye well I&#39;m working on a new skill for OpenRune, Mysticism - but I&#39;ve encountered a problem:

[b]The xp is given fine[/b]
[b]I level up fine[/b]
[b]The levels are saved fine[/b]

But...

On the stat screen, where it says my Mysticism Level, it doesn&#39;t update it unless I log out and in.. (F.y.i the mysticism level on my server has been placed where your quest points were normally shown)

Any ideas what I might have done wrong? Sorry about not posting all the code I&#39;ve got for level-ups etc, but the source is on my other computer which does not currently have an active connection to the internet.

Thanks guys.

Edit: It would probably be better if you could PM me a solution/possible solution as I might forget to re-visit my post (as I often have done in the past)
