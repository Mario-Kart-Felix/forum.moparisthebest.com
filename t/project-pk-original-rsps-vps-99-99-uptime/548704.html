        <p>[CENTER]Hello rune-server community. I am once again attempting to host a server. This time its different. One of my m8s hosts a hosting company and hooked me up with a free vps account. I am trusting him as he is also my owner.</p>
<p>Project-Pk will be an eco based server with a twist of pk. What i mean by this is that we have the basic eco Goals, and than we have Pk goals. Eco goals are usually to obtain all the great items through hard work. The Pk goals are getting the items through pking but i have added other ways you can obtain these items without going through so much killing… The better weapons such as chaotic, statius, vesta etc. are obtained through the shop. The decent items you can go and do Skull Boss’s. To attempt to fight a skull boss you must unlock the required skull. We only have 1 type of SPAWN, and that is at 10 player kills you are able to get verac,torag,karil,and ahrims sets. Just so that it doesnt get boring out there in the wild. We do NOT provide any player with quick easy levels such as ::master or ::setlevel. You do however get to choose a level difficulty at the start of your game-play.</p>
