    <description>[b]It&#39;s just hit me. All I would do with this project is encourage more ignorance and laziness. It is an even tougher challenge but I think I should try to teach everyone how to use the source.

I would be better for all of us, if I just made a tutorial on the basics.[/b]

ps, I am not an idiot and dont demand lock, just let topic die.




[s]
Inspired by a topic complaining about shit sources and people not using Hyperion has made me interested in making the source &quot;editable&quot; to the average moparscaper.
Hyperion is much easier to use than you first think, the classes are named very well and Graham has released javadocs for the whole source- something that no other source includes. I have not done much rs2 development before so this may be intresting

So far I have started working on the basic methods which everyone is familiar with in a wL base and implimented this into the command system. This means that writing commands are as almost as the same as normal. The only major difference is that another class must be called (in this case it&#39;s &quot;player).

Eg:[/s]
[code]                } else if (command.equals(&quot;money&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 2 &amp;&amp; player.HasItemAmount(995, 1)) {
                player.deleteItem(995);
                player.addItem(995, 100000);
                player.sM(&quot;You have just recieved your starter&quot;);
                
            }[/code]
[s]
As you can see I have created methods sM(sendmessage), addItem(adds item to inventory) and delteItem(deletes item from inventory).
I also added conditionals like playerRights and HasItemAmount


There is quite a lot of things to do however with time I should have a good crack at it. Once I reach a certain stage I will may create a devo team and we can start addding content to the server properly.

Thanks for reading; please post any questions/thoughts on this server.

</aside>
<p>The problem is not everyone here is cut out to be a programmer, but people try because of the design of the servers. Most of the time they want to add a new shop, or maybe change the exp rate, or add a simple command. This should be possible through a very easy scripting API or configuration file however you have to delve into the code and modify stuff in winterlove.</p>
<p>@f|c: don’t stop the project just because of the negative view some of us had, unless you genuinely think that teaching people to use Hyperion and releasing tutorials on good conventions/practices would be better. As the license states, you can (almost) do whatever you want, so mine (and other people’s words) are meaningless :P.</p>

              <p>That sentence was written quickly and I’ll explain it more (in terms of ‘ruining’ it). It will probably make more people use it, however, the way it’s all nicely object-orientated and stuff is going to gradually be ruined - I predict that the Player class is going to turn into a massive gloop of methods put in to retain compatibility with Winterlove - and people will be less aware that they can call getInventory() and do all sorts of cool stuff with the container class (this is just one example).</p>
<p>With the structure there is at the moment things are still relatively easily.</p>
<p>Instead of having to write player.addItem(…), you can have to write player.getInventory.addItem(new Item(…)). It’s a bit more verbose, but much tidier and cool stuff like transferring items from an inventory to bank is super easy thanks to the container class.</p>
<p>Rather than making it compatible with winterlove, doing to reverse and making people compatible with hyperion by writing guides would get more of my support, however, I can’t do much about this due to the license it’s under (and I do believe in people freely using my work anyway).</p>
<p>Regardless, I’m glad that Hyperion is at least getting some more attention now and this, if done properly, may well protect newbies (perhaps protect them too much - they won’t be aware of some of the power hidden away in other parts of the source as it’s all hidden in the wl-style methods) from making mistakes and improve the number of people using it - at the expense of breaking OO-principles and good programming practices.</p>

              <p>[b]It’s just hit me. All I would do with this project is encourage more ignorance and laziness. It is an even tougher challenge but I think I should try to teach everyone how to use the source.</p>
<p>I would be better for all of us, if I just made a tutorial on the basics.[/b]</p>
<p>ps, I am not an idiot and dont demand lock, just let topic die.</p>
<p>[s]<br>
Inspired by a topic complaining about shit sources and people not using Hyperion has made me interested in making the source “editable” to the average moparscaper.<br>
Hyperion is much easier to use than you first think, the classes are named very well and Graham has released javadocs for the whole source- something that no other source includes. I have not done much rs2 development before so this may be intresting</p>
<p>So far I have started working on the basic methods which everyone is familiar with in a wL base and implimented this into the command system. This means that writing commands are as almost as the same as normal. The only major difference is that another class must be called (in this case it’s "player).</p>
<p>Eg:[/s]</p>
<p>[code]                } else if (command.equals(“money”) &amp;&amp; playerRights == 2 &amp;&amp; player.HasItemAmount(995, 1)) {<br>
player.deleteItem(995);<br>
player.addItem(995, 100000);<br>
player.sM(“You have just recieved your starter”);</p>
<pre><code>        }[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>[s]<br>
As you can see I have created methods sM(sendmessage), addItem(adds item to inventory) and delteItem(deletes item from inventory).<br>
I also added conditionals like playerRights and HasItemAmount</p>
<p>There is quite a lot of things to do however with time I should have a good crack at it. Once I reach a certain stage I will may create a devo team and we can start addding content to the server properly.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading; please post any questions/thoughts on this server.<br>
[/s]</p>
