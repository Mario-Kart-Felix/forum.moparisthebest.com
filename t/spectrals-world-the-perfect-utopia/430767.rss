    <title>Spectral&#39;s World - The Perfect Utopia</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/spectrals-world-the-perfect-utopia/430767</link>
    <description>[center][size=50pt][font=comic sans ms]Spectral&#39;s World[/font][/size][/center]

-Project has been put on hold till next week due to me not having access to the computer that contains them. 

[center]Spectral&#39;s World originated from a much less impressive and very inexperienced PI source that I developed back in early 2011, I later went on to develop it again later that year but dropped the project as I became increasingly bored with the source (Base being Project Insanity aswell) and never actually opened a development thread for it, so I like to think of this as Spectral&#39;s World 2.0 when in reality it should be 3.0. As for the Deob of this one, it&#39;s a 634 with a few 646 Implemented items.[/center]

[center]My honest and true intentions for this server are to create a lag free and fun Pking and Economic environment that has a stable economy and player base. Not only that but I&#39;d like to implement custom quests into the game to keep a rather more unique feeling to the game that also keeps the players busy with meeting requirements for a weapon other then clicking on an npc waiting 10 seconds and then moving on to the next one gaining level after level, I also feel that by doing this and making certain weapons and armors gained only through quests instead of player trade it will keep the economy balanced on other things rather then being focused just on pking and keep items such as the abbysal whip&#39;s prices from crashing.[/center]

[Center]This is not a Runescape Remake of any revision in any way..[/center]

[u][b][size=10pt]Media[/size][/b][/u]
[img]http://i.imgur.com/XYbqj.jpg[/img]

With media will come criticism, from the photos you obviously can&#39;t see what I&#39;ve posted about so far but I more so wanted you to see the combat side of the server. (Why did you include photos of things you didn&#39;t even code?) Well, as you can see from the picture of Nex, I added Magic/Range/Melee attacks to him aswell as animations teleporting affects, &quot;*cough* *cough*&quot; forced text and his followers which attack you the whole time while standing completely in place.

[u][b]Ancient Curses picture[/b][/u]? Instead of simply typing in a command such as &quot;::curses true/false&quot; I&#39;m developing a mini quest called Nomads Adventure (which I won&#39;t go into detail about now) and added an altar to which you must pray at to activate your curses. Without completing the quest you won&#39;t be able to pray at the altar or even reach the location of it.

[u][b]Korasi Picture[/b][/u]? In the source I downloaded the Korasi&#39;s special took away 60% or so of the special bar in which case I lowered it down to 55% and added the Ring of Vigour&#39;s effect so if you&#39;re skilled enough you&#39;ll easily be able to double special you filthy rushers. =) 

[u][b]Bandos Picture[/b][/u]? Previously you could enter the Bandos Chamber without any Bandos kills or hammer to pound on the frozen door. I quickly added orks, goblins, ogres, and cyclops (along with all other npc&#39;s for other GWD bosses). You also now require a hammer to be used on the frozen door to enter the minions room.

[u][b]Dark Bow Picture[/b][/u]? Just thought it&#39;d look bad ass.

[u][b]Obelisk Teleporting Picture[/b][/u]? You can barely see it but I&#39;m standing in the middle of a wilderness obelisk in which case I&#39;ve added now when you click it, it will randomly teleport you to any other obelisk inside of the wilderness (even above level 50) unfortunately I have to use the lunar teleport animation as I&#39;m to lazy to find the right one at the moment.

[u][b]Corporeal Beast Picture[/b][/u]? Previously you&#39;d be teleported into the actual room containing the Corporeal Beast where he&#39;d begin to smack you while your loading. I&#39;ve now changed it to where you teleport to the room outside of him and you can view his room by right clicking on the overpass and clicking &quot;spectate&quot;. Not only that but I&#39;ve added the Dark Core which will fly out directly in front of the corporeal beast (I&#39;ve not yet added to where it fly towards you, but assuming your meleeing it&#39;ll fly towards you then) and it&#39;s also on a looped timer so it&#39;s not random yet either.

[b][u]Group Veng Picture[/u][/b]? I&#39;ve added the Group Vengeance spell (haaaaaard coooooooooooded) it&#39;s icon to click is also located at the bottom of the Lunar&#39;s Spell book at the moment and will not light up when you have the required runes for it.
It also gives you vengeance and anyone within 3 Squares away from you, the veng for you will turn red and the veng for others will be white and it will force the veng animation on you and send a forced text saying, &quot;Group vengeance!&quot; if you&#39;re the caster of the spell. 

-I&#39;d also like some opinions on turning this into a Development Team project? I feel with a bigger team other then just myself we&#39;d truly be able to accomplish this task.</description>

Thanks for the luck! I have a VPS ready for when and if it does.<br>
Might I also add the player handling is excellent!<br>
[/quote]I’ll keep my eye on this thread for when you open it to the public[/quote]<br>
Sure thing, I’ll probably release a Beta Testing client for people to play around on and find bugs which I’ll host on my computer/internet. If there aren’t a dreadful amount then I’ll put it on my VPS and update it majorly every 3 hours or so.</p>

              <p>[center][size=50pt][font=comic sans ms]Spectral’s World[/font][/size][/center]</p>
<p>-Project has been put on hold till next week due to me not having access to the computer that contains them.</p>
<p>[center]Spectral’s World originated from a much less impressive and very inexperienced PI source that I developed back in early 2011, I later went on to develop it again later that year but dropped the project as I became increasingly bored with the source (Base being Project Insanity aswell) and never actually opened a development thread for it, so I like to think of this as Spectral’s World 2.0 when in reality it should be 3.0. As for the Deob of this one, it’s a 634 with a few 646 Implemented items.[/center]</p>
<p>[center]My honest and true intentions for this server are to create a lag free and fun Pking and Economic environment that has a stable economy and player base. Not only that but I’d like to implement custom quests into the game to keep a rather more unique feeling to the game that also keeps the players busy with meeting requirements for a weapon other then clicking on an npc waiting 10 seconds and then moving on to the next one gaining level after level, I also feel that by doing this and making certain weapons and armors gained only through quests instead of player trade it will keep the economy balanced on other things rather then being focused just on pking and keep items such as the abbysal whip’s prices from crashing.[/center]</p>
<p>[Center]This is not a Runescape Remake of any revision in any way…[/center]</p>
<p>[size=10pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Day-By-Day Update Diary</span></span>[/size]</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">[size=10pt]Media[/size]</span></span><br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i.imgur.com/XYbqj.jpg" title="XYbqj.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XYbqj.jpg" alt width="562" height="500"><div class="meta">

<p>With media will come criticism, from the photos you obviously can’t see what I’ve posted about so far but I more so wanted you to see the combat side of the server. (Why did you include photos of things you didn’t even code?) Well, as you can see from the picture of Nex, I added Magic/Range/Melee attacks to him aswell as animations teleporting affects, “<em>cough</em> <em>cough</em>” forced text and his followers which attack you the whole time while standing completely in place.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Ancient Curses picture</span></span>? Instead of simply typing in a command such as “::curses true/false” I’m developing a mini quest called Nomads Adventure (which I won’t go into detail about now) and added an altar to which you must pray at to activate your curses. Without completing the quest you won’t be able to pray at the altar or even reach the location of it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Korasi Picture</span></span>? In the source I downloaded the Korasi’s special took away 60% or so of the special bar in which case I lowered it down to 55% and added the Ring of Vigour’s effect so if you’re skilled enough you’ll easily be able to double special you filthy rushers. =)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Bandos Picture</span></span>? Previously you could enter the Bandos Chamber without any Bandos kills or hammer to pound on the frozen door. I quickly added orks, goblins, ogres, and cyclops (along with all other npc’s for other GWD bosses). You also now require a hammer to be used on the frozen door to enter the minions room.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Dark Bow Picture</span></span>? Just thought it’d look bad ass.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Obelisk Teleporting Picture</span></span>? You can barely see it but I’m standing in the middle of a wilderness obelisk in which case I’ve added now when you click it, it will randomly teleport you to any other obelisk inside of the wilderness (even above level 50) unfortunately I have to use the lunar teleport animation as I’m to lazy to find the right one at the moment.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Corporeal Beast Picture</span></span>? Previously you’d be teleported into the actual room containing the Corporeal Beast where he’d begin to smack you while your loading. I’ve now changed it to where you teleport to the room outside of him and you can view his room by right clicking on the overpass and clicking “spectate”. Not only that but I’ve added the Dark Core which will fly out directly in front of the corporeal beast (I’ve not yet added to where it fly towards you, but assuming your meleeing it’ll fly towards you then) and it’s also on a looped timer so it’s not random yet either.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">Group Veng Picture</span></span>? I’ve added the Group Vengeance spell (haaaaaard coooooooooooded) it’s icon to click is also located at the bottom of the Lunar’s Spell book at the moment and will not light up when you have the required runes for it.<br>
It also gives you vengeance and anyone within 3 Squares away from you, the veng for you will turn red and the veng for others will be white and it will force the veng animation on you and send a forced text saying, “Group vengeance!” if you’re the caster of the spell.</p>
<p>-I’d also like some opinions on turning this into a Development Team project? I feel with a bigger team other then just myself we’d truly be able to accomplish this task.</p>
