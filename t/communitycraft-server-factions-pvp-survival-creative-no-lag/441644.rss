Welcome
Welcome to one of the best Minecraft servers out there. Community-Craft is a server that aims to supply a flawless gameplay while retaining an enjoyable atmosphere. We&#39;re all about pleasing every type of player, whether it be a &quot;Hardcore PvP-er&quot; or an &quot;Expert Survivalist&quot;. With many worlds that await you, there&#39;s not much more you can ask for! But we always accept new ideas, so if you&#39;d like to, head over to our forums and drop a post!
Live Support
We know that many players will have inquiries and statements to be made, so if you can&#39;t contact us in-game, here are some alternatives.
TeamSpeak
This alternative is the best way to go, as many are often on, especially the admins. Our IP is play.community-craft.com, and there is no password. If you don&#39;t know what this form of communication is, check out the TeamSpeak website for more information.
Steam
This alternative is also an acceptable form, as we will get friend/message notifications instantly. Please excuse us, however, if we do not respond immediately. Account: Superbomb17; Account: MrGreenJellyBean.
Server Rules
There are a few rules that players will have to follow. Please read the following.

    Do not use/affiliate yourself with 3rd-Party clients/mods that allow you to have an advantage over others.
    Do not spam the chat or &quot;hack&quot; in any way, shape, or form.
    Respect the staff members. These are the people putting their time and money to give you this server.
    Respect all fellow Community-Craft members, as they would like to have an enjoyable time as well.
    Do not create factions without first asking an admin. 
    All faction bases must be located in the PvP World. If they are not, all land in your faction will be unclaimed.
    Do not advertise other websites/servers without the permission from an admin.
    Do not disrupt the gameplay of another player. This includes being an annoyance to them(trolling, stalking, being in their way, etc.)
    Do not grief/steal unless you are in the PvP world.
    Do not talk back to staff members. They always have the last word.
    Do not private chests in PvP.
    Do not ask for promotions.

    Rei&#39;s Minimap - ReiFNSK
