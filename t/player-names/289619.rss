    <title>Player names</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/player-names/289619</link>
    <description>Hey, in my client no players are allowed to have characters such as &quot;-&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, or pretty much any character that isn&#39;t a letter or number. I think this is so people don&#39;t crash the server. But, is it possible to change it so you can have &quot;-&quot; in your name? 

Thanks.

              <p>Yes, it is possible.</p>
<p>I don’t remember exactly how but there is something in your files that specifically points out those characters so they can not be used.</p>
<p>It can easily be removed once you find it.<br>
Careful what you let your players name themselves though, some can mess up your server!</p>
