    <description>[center][size=24pt][b]Project RandQm[/b][/size]
[size=14pt][i][b]~ Because a more unoriginal name wasn&#39;t possible ~[/b][/i][/size][/center]




[size=14pt][b]Intro[/b][/size]
Project RandQm has been created of the absolute framework of LightRune by klept0.
The original LightRune release already had some content which I removed to not create the feeling
of 2 programming styles in one server.
The absolute framework like networking, packetbuilding and a part of player updating has been kept.
All the rest you will find in this server has been programmed by me from scratch,
sometimes referenced to lightrune closer to the core code.

This is being created not only for personal learning purposes but as well in hopes of
getting to move people from Delta and PI to this. I know many servers with this goal have
passed by and only a few actually reach the goal. But if I only see one release based on this
I already will be happy. And else I at least learned a lot from it.

Servers like Hyperion and Apollo are definitely a lot better than this project.
One reason for that is that I simply do not have the skills of a Graham.
2nd I don&#39;t want to create a server that looks like Chinese for unexperienced programmers.
With Project RandQm I aim to create a server with quality but at the same time staying user friendly.
Somebody coming from PI should find the way in this server as much as somebody coming from Hyperion.

Of course this is not a ready-made server aimed to a particular group of programmers, e.g. PI-programmers,
and inspecting code will still be required in able to work with this server.


[size=14pt][b]Latest stress-test results:[/b][/size]
Today (30th of July) I performed the first stress test on Project RandQm
I used the runerebels stresstester for this.
NOTE: Due the lack of added packages, no actions were performed by the robots, therefore these are not accurate numbers.
NOTE2: The reached amount of connections is the actual maximum connections allowed I had set for the server.
           Once I have my packets done I will do a new stress-test without connection limits and with performing actions.
The CPU load was at the peak: 10% (i7 26300M 2.0GHZ)
The RAM load was at the peak: 2.6GB
The amount of active connections reached: 2998
2997 bots + myself as player

[s][size=14pt][b]Stuff that isn&#39;t planned to be done on release.[/b][/size]
Combat wont be added yet in this release, though hitupdates etc... are working.
so it&#39;s just a combat system for both players and npc&#39;s that should be added.
Maybe I will release a version with combat, but at this point I do not have the time
to do this. So feel free to rerealease this base with combat, once it has been released.[/s]




[size=13pt][b]End-Note:[/b][/size]
I know all my last projects went ended in nothing, and that&#39;s the reason why I didn&#39;t post this development earlier,
though I&#39;ve been working on it for some time. The biggest part of my goals is already finished at this point and I don&#39;t doubt
that I will finish this.

              <p>[center][size=24pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Project RandQm</span>[/size]<br>
[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">~ Because a more unoriginal name wasn’t possible ~</span></span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Intro</span>[/size]<br>
Project RandQm has been created of the absolute framework of LightRune by klept0.<br>
The original LightRune release already had some content which I removed to not create the feeling<br>
of 2 programming styles in one server.<br>
The absolute framework like networking, packetbuilding and a part of player updating has been kept.<br>
All the rest you will find in this server has been programmed by me from scratch,<br>
sometimes referenced to lightrune closer to the core code.</p>
<p>This is being created not only for personal learning purposes but as well in hopes of<br>
getting to move people from Delta and PI to this. I know many servers with this goal have<br>
passed by and only a few actually reach the goal. But if I only see one release based on this<br>
I already will be happy. And else I at least learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>Servers like Hyperion and Apollo are definitely a lot better than this project.<br>
One reason for that is that I simply do not have the skills of a Graham.<br>
2nd I don’t want to create a server that looks like Chinese for unexperienced programmers.<br>
With Project RandQm I aim to create a server with quality but at the same time staying user friendly.<br>
Somebody coming from PI should find the way in this server as much as somebody coming from Hyperion.</p>
<p>Of course this is not a ready-made server aimed to a particular group of programmers, e.g. PI-programmers,<br>
and inspecting code will still be required in able to work with this server.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Latest stress-test results:</span>[/size]<br>
Today (30th of July) I performed the first stress test on Project RandQm<br>
I used the runerebels stresstester for this.<br>
NOTE: Due the lack of added packages, no actions were performed by the robots, therefore these are not accurate numbers.<br>
NOTE2: The reached amount of connections is the actual maximum connections allowed I had set for the server.<br>
Once I have my packets done I will do a new stress-test without connection limits and with performing actions.<br>
The CPU load was at the peak: 10% (i7 26300M 2.0GHZ)<br>
The RAM load was at the peak: 2.6GB<br>
The amount of active connections reached: 2998<br>
2997 bots + myself as player</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-s">[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Stuff that isn’t planned to be done on release.</span>[/size]<br>
Combat wont be added yet in this release, though hitupdates etc… are working.<br>
so it’s just a combat system for both players and npc’s that should be added.<br>
Maybe I will release a version with combat, but at this point I do not have the time<br>
to do this. So feel free to rerealease this base with combat, once it has been released.</span></p>
<p>[size=13pt]<span class="bbcode-b">End-Note:</span>[/size]<br>
I know all my last projects went ended in nothing, and that’s the reason why I didn’t post this development earlier,<br>
though I’ve been working on it for some time. The biggest part of my goals is already finished at this point and I don’t doubt<br>
that I will finish this.</p>
