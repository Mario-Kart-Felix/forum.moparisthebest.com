    <title>Error, i don&#39;t know what this is!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-i-dont-know-what-this-is/152498</link>
    <description>[code]			characterfile.write(&quot;character-height = &quot;, 0, 19);
			characterfile.write(Integer.toString(heightLevel), 0, Integer.toString(heightLevel).length());
			characterfile.newLine();[/code]
I know what that is and what it does, but i am trying to make a new line above that.  This is what i have...
[code]			characterfile.write(&quot;character-team = &quot;, 0, 11);
			characterfile.write(playerTeam, 0, playerTeam.length());
			characterfile.newLine();[/code]
Do you see the 19 at the end of the line for character-height, i need to know what that means, because i don&#39;t know what number goes at the end of character-team.  Every number i try putting there is wrong, because when the game goes to save the characters, it has some error with whatever number is there, and shuts down.
All i need to know is what that number at the end of the line means, so i know what to put at the end of mine.</description>

Do you see the 19 at the end of the line for character-height, i need to know what that means, because i don’t know what number goes at the end of character-team.  Every number i try putting there is wrong, because when the game goes to save the characters, it has some error with whatever number is there, and shuts down.<br>
