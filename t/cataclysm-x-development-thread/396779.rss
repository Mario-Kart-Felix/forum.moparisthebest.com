Note: The server is already running.

[b][u]Introduction:[/u][/b]
Cataclysm-X is a Private Server unlike any other. We have an uptime of 99.99% and the downtimes are due to necessary frequent server updates. Our objective is to create an enjoyable yet addictive experience for all members old and new.


[u][b]Economy:[/b][/u]
Cataclysm-X has a unique style of economy which is based around items and ultimately: PK. 

Item prices vary depending on the rarity and usefullness of the item. Our economy does not set extremely high prices on the items making it fairer for everyone to obtain whether the person has donater status or F2P.
Our economy is split into two currencies:

[u]Gold Coins:[/u] Easy to obtain due to the variety of ’quick-cash’ methods Cataclysm-X offers to members. Gold coins make up the basic economy to the RSPS and this is the currency beginner members should use to climb to the top.

[u]Cataclysm-X Points:[/u] Trickier to obtain as it really depends on the skill of the person in the PK combat zones.These CXPoints are the currency used to purchase other exclusive valuable items. There are two methods to acquire these points for both donators and F2P members:
-PK (each player killed earns you 10 points)
-Skilling (each combat level earns you 10 points, and each non-combat level earns you 20 points)

Unlike most server, they all start at edgeville and you know the routine.<br>
This source, You have Points to get items, you can either skill or you can pk and you be rewarded 10 points and then you can go to the Point shop and spend it. There is a different mood unlike all the other servers you find nowadays.<br>

I’m pretty sure you find that on 1 out of 2 servers, and homes switch between edgeville, miscellania, etc.[/quote]<br>
