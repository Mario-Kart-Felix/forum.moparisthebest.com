    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/old-world-e300-this-time-its-serious/529577</link>
    <description>[b]I will make a update thread later, while I uploaded I had to study for my Geo Hon Quiz.[/b]

[center]No Picture, yet.[/center]



[center][i]It begins as a dream, a promise, something unbelieavbely unachieveable.[/i][/center] : [b]Server Motto[/b]

[center][i]&quot;Justice doesn&#39;t discriminated. Comes as cold and bracing. Leaving you with a chill you can&#39;t shake.&quot;[/i][/center] : [b]Game Motto[/b]





[center][size=14pt][b]Fundamentals of I[/b][/size][/center]

[size=8pt]Before I go to any brief information and knowledge about my server I want to dedicate this section of me. As some([one]) of you might know(I will not reveal who, who shall reveal himself if he&#39;d/she&#39;d like.) me, I am the legendary Driman Rune. I am deeply sadden to state the obvious why I made a new account and if it shall affect any(or someone). The reason of my some of you may state daily new account is that I have come in love with this name, and Driman is getting pretty bit old. My perspective on Gaius-Julius Caesar might have a deep impact on the community as the way they view me, or might not. I view Julius Caesar as a great man. So on to the point of this own section, I made this account because I just wanted to get away from the drama. This implies with everyone(some) just cyber-bullying(name calling[&quot;Dremen&quot;, &quot;DriMAN&quot;, &quot;DRYMEN&quot;, &quot;DRYMAN&quot;]), I will admit I did use some sort of form of cyber-bullying. I have spoken with a player moderator(he shall reveal himself, if he&#39;d like.), and he has accepted my reasons being. He totally understood and accepted me making a new account part being since he already saw my IP address, so their is really no reason to try and state the obvious that I&#39;m not who I am. From now on I will enforce this upon me that I shall not lie to me or to others. So that is all I wanted to say, I promise you this isn&#39;t a troll thread or a troll DRIMAN. I had to force myself to pressurize my studying and homework and adding more time to my runescape private server(which I have reasoned and stated that It&#39;s my passion, everyday that goes by without me coding, I feel pain.). Some of you may say, why keep on making threads after your thread has been locked before? Will the reason being is that moderators have(had) a meeting going on whilst I was writing this. I don&#39;t want my previous threads to be unlocked because I seriously made a fool out of my own self.[/size]



[center][size=14pt][b]The Base[/b][/size][/center]

[size=8pt]As I have stated before, I will be using E300, and E300 only. I am on the verge of releasing and finishing. Since people have pressured me to finishing and start on posting, I had to force myself to. I added many things I can&#39;t state because well, the list goes on.[/size]

Please note this isn&#39;t from Sanity or any other reasons being.

[i]Credits:[/i]
[size=7pt]Me[/size]70% &lt;- YES, oh yes.
[size=7pt]Sanity[/size]15% &lt;- trying to reduce this state of obvious reasons.
[size=7pt]Others(Jagex Ltd.)[/size]15% &lt;- trying to reduce this state of being.

Me: I have been on this project for a couple of months now, and I have added things on my own since I am capable. Not to mention that, only 2-5% of my content is converted from Hyperion and RuneSource.

Sanity: I have added fast content the past days in order to appetite my supporters and viewers. 70-75% of the content that is added from Sanity&#39;s (PI) is converted to fit my server.

Others: The only others is Jagex Ltd, and Eclipse. The rs2 package inside my src is purely what I think Runescape&#39;s. The package involves the rs2login protocol. Eclipse for helping me figure out the mistakes I make via Java Errors.

I will always use E300, for all my releases(this will be my final runescape private server and only runescape private server project). FACE IT, this will also last years possibly until death.



[center][size=14pt][b]What is this?[/b][/size][/center]

[size=8pt]Old World(E300 Base) is a free, fun MMORPG(runescape private server based) exclusively on the History of the unknown world of Gielinor. My main goal is to achieve and complete a goal that has never been done. I will be using OldTek(cache) and upgrading it every so often so you the players can get a better view. You the players will be able to play unwritten 1st Age of my perspective on what Runescape should be. Also to where players can interact within atmosphere. What I am trying to state is that everything in my(runescape) cache will have a purpose or use.[/size]



[center][size=14pt][b]My inspirations[/b][/size][/center]

[size=8pt]Docent: I&#39;ve known him for a short while, but this person has a brain. He&#39;s always thinking up ideas like the PRO he is. His ideas are far better than my. But with knights comes all history.

Arham 4: I&#39;ve known him pretty much when I first joined Runescape private servers (back in Nov 2012). Arham 4 isn&#39;t the best but he is a guy you would consider as a friend as he is always trying to help you. I like his World 901, it has a lot of ideas and love (and deserves attention). But with all world 901 their comes World 2. I consider him a role model, and I tried to become a tutorial helper mainly because of him.

Luna-scape: I completely forgot all the fun we had together since we met a long time ago. She or he was nice and kind, I will never forget you. You always inspired me to continue on continuing my project.

enzo42: I basically consider you as the creator of Delta, mainly because I always have loved your releases. Your new H project(sorry I forgot what it&#39;s called.) is a good project.

RandQm: I always loved your Delta releases also. Not to say I was inspired by your Utopia work.

Haters: All the hate made me do better.[/size]



[center][size=14pt][b]Timeline of the 1st Age[/b][/size][/center]

[size=8pt]This is my project and I state how the history goes, BUT the player writes the history right?[/size]


[ul][li][i]Player logins in and a dialogue appears.[/i][/li]
[li][i]At login player chooses any type of class. ( Knight, House of Romanatic, Priest ).[/i][/li]
[li][i]Whilst player chooses one of those 3 classes, the packet starts sending the information of what that particular class has.[/i][/li]
[li][i]Deep dialogue occurs and tells the player what is happening and what happened.[/i][/li]
[li][i]The player will have the option to either change the class or keep the class.[/i][/li]
[li][i]The player will end up in Lumbridge and a packet will send all the configurations between wether players can enter cities and or towns.[/i][/li]
[li][i]The player will have 10-20 achievements to complete in order to leave Lumbridge(more of a tutorial) and go off.[/i][/li]
[li][i]Once the player is done completing the achievements a packet will call and open all gates outside of Lumbridge.[/i][/li]
[li][i]The player will have the option to go to near opened city. (Draynor Village) or explore other cities.[/i][/li]
[li][i]All cities have their own king or queen and God to worship some might be monotheistic.[/i][/li][/ul]

To be continued…

Knight: Fight as a knight and seek wins by battling.
House of Romanatic: Learn and grow up to be a king or leader. You start as a Knight and learn to be a priest then you end up as a King or Queen.
Priest: Learn the romantic religion of Gielinor.


[center][size=14pt][b]Development Team[/b][/size][/center]

I have decided to create the Union JASPRO ([b]Ja[/b]va [b]S[/b]olo [b]Pro[/b]graming [b]Pro[/b]ject.) The union consists of Me and me only.


[center][size=14pt][b]Random Media:[/b][/size][/center]
[size=8pt]Sorry, all I have promise I will update this later on this day.[/size]

Yes, I will change the titlebox.dat and the tutlebutton.dat, I just realized it doesn&#39;t fit as a old-school. Possibly might change the background.

[size=8pt]Sorry, all I have promise I will update this later on this day.[/size]</p>
<p>Yes, I will change the titlebox.dat and the tutlebutton.dat, I just realized it doesn’t fit as a old-school. Possibly might change the background.</p>

Took minutes making the titlebutton and titlebox.<br>
Took careful procedures whilst editing the rs2 login protocol.<br>
Fixed a client dupe dealing with player would successfully getting a player’s password by some special command.<br>
Worked on editing the interfaces, making them more of a 474 type.<br>
Finally finished upgrading the cache from a 317 to a 457, took long but finally did.<br>
Fixed a null point dealing with a couple of while loops.<br>
Added owner loop that is hard to find and remove.[/size]<br>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">I will make a update thread later, while I uploaded I had to study for my Geo Hon Quiz.</span></p>
<p>[center]No Picture, yet.[/center]</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-i">It begins as a dream, a promise, something unbelieavbely unachieveable.</span>[/center] : <span class="bbcode-b">Server Motto</span></p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-i">“Justice doesn’t discriminated. Comes as cold and bracing. Leaving you with a chill you can’t shake.”</span>[/center] : <span class="bbcode-b">Game Motto</span></p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Fundamentals of I</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[size=8pt]Before I go to any brief information and knowledge about my server I want to dedicate this section of me. As some([one]) of you might know(I will not reveal who, who shall reveal himself if he’d/she’d like.) me, I am the legendary Driman Rune. I am deeply sadden to state the obvious why I made a new account and if it shall affect any(or someone). The reason of my some of you may state daily new account is that I have come in love with this name, and Driman is getting pretty bit old. My perspective on Gaius-Julius Caesar might have a deep impact on the community as the way they view me, or might not. I view Julius Caesar as a great man. So on to the point of this own section, I made this account because I just wanted to get away from the drama. This implies with everyone(some) just cyber-bullying(name calling[“Dremen”, “DriMAN”, “DRYMEN”, “DRYMAN”]), I will admit I did use some sort of form of cyber-bullying. I have spoken with a player moderator(he shall reveal himself, if he’d like.), and he has accepted my reasons being. He totally understood and accepted me making a new account part being since he already saw my IP address, so their is really no reason to try and state the obvious that I’m not who I am. From now on I will enforce this upon me that I shall not lie to me or to others. So that is all I wanted to say, I promise you this isn’t a troll thread or a troll DRIMAN. I had to force myself to pressurize my studying and homework and adding more time to my runescape private server(which I have reasoned and stated that It’s my passion, everyday that goes by without me coding, I feel pain.). Some of you may say, why keep on making threads after your thread has been locked before? Will the reason being is that moderators have(had) a meeting going on whilst I was writing this. I don’t want my previous threads to be unlocked because I seriously made a fool out of my own self.[/size]</p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">The Base</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[size=8pt]As I have stated before, I will be using E300, and E300 only. I am on the verge of releasing and finishing. Since people have pressured me to finishing and start on posting, I had to force myself to. I added many things I can’t state because well, the list goes on.[/size]</p>
<p>Please note this isn’t from Sanity or any other reasons being.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Credits:</span><br>
[size=7pt]Me[/size]70% &lt;- YES, oh yes.<br>
[size=7pt]Sanity[/size]15% &lt;- trying to reduce this state of obvious reasons.<br>
[size=7pt]Others(Jagex Ltd.)[/size]15% &lt;- trying to reduce this state of being.</p>
<p>Me: I have been on this project for a couple of months now, and I have added things on my own since I am capable. Not to mention that, only 2-5% of my content is converted from Hyperion and RuneSource.</p>
<p>Sanity: I have added fast content the past days in order to appetite my supporters and viewers. 70-75% of the content that is added from Sanity’s (PI) is converted to fit my server.</p>
<p>Others: The only others is Jagex Ltd, and Eclipse. The rs2 package inside my src is purely what I think Runescape’s. The package involves the rs2login protocol. Eclipse for helping me figure out the mistakes I make via Java Errors.</p>
<p>I will always use E300, for all my releases(this will be my final runescape private server and only runescape private server project). FACE IT, this will also last years possibly until death.</p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">What is this?</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[size=8pt]Old World(E300 Base) is a free, fun MMORPG(runescape private server based) exclusively on the History of the unknown world of Gielinor. My main goal is to achieve and complete a goal that has never been done. I will be using OldTek(cache) and upgrading it every so often so you the players can get a better view. You the players will be able to play unwritten 1st Age of my perspective on what Runescape should be. Also to where players can interact within atmosphere. What I am trying to state is that everything in my(runescape) cache will have a purpose or use.[/size]</p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">My inspirations</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[size=8pt]Docent: I’ve known him for a short while, but this person has a brain. He’s always thinking up ideas like the PRO he is. His ideas are far better than my. But with knights comes all history.</p>
<p>Arham 4: I’ve known him pretty much when I first joined Runescape private servers (back in Nov 2012). Arham 4 isn’t the best but he is a guy you would consider as a friend as he is always trying to help you. I like his World 901, it has a lot of ideas and love (and deserves attention). But with all world 901 their comes World 2. I consider him a role model, and I tried to become a tutorial helper mainly because of him.</p>
<p>Luna-scape: I completely forgot all the fun we had together since we met a long time ago. She or he was nice and kind, I will never forget you. You always inspired me to continue on continuing my project.</p>
<p>enzo42: I basically consider you as the creator of Delta, mainly because I always have loved your releases. Your new H project(sorry I forgot what it’s called.) is a good project.</p>
<p>RandQm: I always loved your Delta releases also. Not to say I was inspired by your Utopia work.</p>
<p>Haters: All the hate made me do better.[/size]</p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Timeline of the 1st Age</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>[size=8pt]This is my project and I state how the history goes, BUT the player writes the history right?[/size]</p>
<p>[ul][li]<span class="bbcode-i">Player logins in and a dialogue appears.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">At login player chooses any type of class. ( Knight, House of Romanatic, Priest ).</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">Whilst player chooses one of those 3 classes, the packet starts sending the information of what that particular class has.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">Deep dialogue occurs and tells the player what is happening and what happened.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">The player will have the option to either change the class or keep the class.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">The player will end up in Lumbridge and a packet will send all the configurations between wether players can enter cities and or towns.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">The player will have 10-20 achievements to complete in order to leave Lumbridge(more of a tutorial) and go off.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">Once the player is done completing the achievements a packet will call and open all gates outside of Lumbridge.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">The player will have the option to go to near opened city. (Draynor Village) or explore other cities.</span>[/li]<br>
[li]<span class="bbcode-i">All cities have their own king or queen and God to worship some might be monotheistic.</span>[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>To be continued…</p>
<p>Knight: Fight as a knight and seek wins by battling.<br>
House of Romanatic: Learn and grow up to be a king or leader. You start as a Knight and learn to be a priest then you end up as a King or Queen.<br>
Priest: Learn the romantic religion of Gielinor.</p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Development Team</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p>I have decided to create the Union JASPRO (<span class="bbcode-b">Ja</span>va <span class="bbcode-b">S</span>olo <span class="bbcode-b">Pro</span>graming <span class="bbcode-b">Pro</span>ject.) The union consists of Me and me only.</p>
<p>[center][size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Random Media:</span>[/size][/center]<br>
[size=8pt]Sorry, all I have promise I will update this later on this day.[/size]</p>
<p>Yes, I will change the titlebox.dat and the tutlebutton.dat, I just realized it doesn’t fit as a old-school. Possibly might change the background.</p>
