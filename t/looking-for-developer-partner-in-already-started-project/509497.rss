    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-developer-partner-in-already-started-project/509497</link>
    <description>Hi! I have been developing a server called Hulsifscape, Ive added new home, shops, and other things but on a level of 1-10 im about a 5-6 for rsps coding.

 I have forums, working client(obviously), There are some things I just cant get to work and need help with! 

If your interested in helping out just reply, I can get the server out there when its done with the help of youtube and 17k subs! 

Thanks!
