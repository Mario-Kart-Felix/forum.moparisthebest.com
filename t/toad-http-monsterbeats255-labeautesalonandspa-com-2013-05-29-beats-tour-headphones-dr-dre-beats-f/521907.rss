And it&#39;s the first class-action suit by simply smokers to reach tryout. Attorneys for the injured parties say manufacturers connected young people and controlled nicotine levels to help keep smokers addicted. However, the cigarette designers say everyone knows medical risks of smoking.A question this trial seeks to answer is whether cigarettes companies should be held liable for making hundreds of thousands of Florida people who smoke sick.Professor David LoganCBS News Correspondent Jules Chen spoke to Get up Forest University Regulation Professor David Logan , a professional in tobacco litigation.He said this demo could set the tone for other litigation down the road.&quot;For plaintiff lawyers, it is an efficient method to try the cases, and possess all the proof for the group of people handled at one time,&quot; Logan explained. &quot;The levels are so much higher because if you win at the 1st phase, there is tremendous pressure put on defendants to settle at that point as well as to cut their cutbacks to avoid actually going into a jury.&quot;And Logan said the impact could be enormous.&quot;A comprehensive plaintiff&#39;s victory, through which they get all of the dollars they request and the award becomes upheld on appeal, might clearly, by itself, cripple the smaller U.Azines. tobacco companies that get relatively small marketplace shares.&quot; he said.If the Miami court finds Big Tobacco liable, the same jurors will return to decide problems in the next phase from the trial.
