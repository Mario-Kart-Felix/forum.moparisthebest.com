    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/problems-with-loading-the-game/289860</link>
    <description>whenever it goes to load the game, it always gets stuck on Maps.
if I&#39;m on a 317, it gets stuck at 23%
if I&#39;m on a 508 it gets stuck at 84%
I&#39;ve downloaded the client and it still gets stuck there too.

is there anything i can do (anything else)
that could help me load the game?</description>
