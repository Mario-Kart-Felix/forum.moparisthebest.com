doing lots updates for my new project wonder what you guys think of these there all possible and started on basically completed and are in beta atm.

I just wanna hear what you guys think depending on what the public thinks I would like to continue or leave this.

The solomons store we just started you basically get your normal skin sets here and you can customize items as you please here.

Im starting a new feature it will take a long time but I have made a lot progress it&#39;s where the player will be able to make their own items 2h or one handed anycolor any size ofc there are limits. It&#39;s a bit sketchy still, but im working on it so far I have the part where you select the options for your weapon</description>

<p>which is why we have set up a timer when entering wilderness you have a set time that you have to wait. about 120 seconds have to pass before the dart can be in use then your arm with the dart in it will light up indicating your ready to shoot it also gets other players to notice it.</p>
<p>There is a way to defend from it and thats the dodging death if player is in wilderness with the dodging death they will not be effected by the dart both will cancel eachother although the person with the dodge death will be dealt considerable damage.</p>
<p>Seeing how its a powerful accessory to have its priced very high and we have done it through pk points now so only the most skilled of players will have a chance to even get close to the priced amount. As you can see at the bottom left corner it says tokens it will determine the number of pk points you have, and when you click an item it will show the price.<br>

You have to realize that adding more barriers doesn’t disregard the fact that there is still a dart that is able to one hit kill a person. You would be better off adding a feature that gives each player a chance of randomly hitting the other player’s HP remaining.[/quote]</p>
<p>everyone does have a chance depending on how well you pk the more tokens you get and if you reach the amount you get the dart.</p>
<p>The feature im trying to do atm is that if you lose a battle in pk you lose tokens</p>

<p>I would suggest incorporating maybe donor points, where if they vote they get 10k solomon points or something and can pay to have items reskinned, kind of like Loyalty.</p>

</aside>
<p>yep we have a little something like that we basically put in loyalty points for everything so atm 24 hours of gameplay gets you 2400 loyalty points depending on your rank extra points for donators.</p>
<p>were still thinking of other ways of payment in game for solomons stores something based on pk to get more players interacting with eachother.</p>

<p>doing lots updates for my new project wonder what you guys think of these there all possible and started on basically completed and are in beta atm.</p>
<p>I just wanna hear what you guys think depending on what the public thinks I would like to continue or leave this.</p>
<p>The solomons store we just started you basically get your normal skin sets here and you can customize items as you please here.</p>
<p>Im starting a new feature it will take a long time but I have made a lot progress it’s where the player will be able to make their own items 2h or one handed anycolor any size ofc there are limits. It’s a bit sketchy still, but im working on it so far I have the part where you select the options for your weapon</p>
