    <title>Mute does not work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mute-does-not-work/307977</link>
    <description>Well, if I try muting someone, it says &quot;Namehere&quot; was muted. And their name goes in my mutes folder. But they don&#39;t get muted in-game. If anybody could help me fix I&#39;d really appreciate it.</description>

<p>Coding error. It’s that, or you’re simply missing the code that makes people “muted”.<br>
Not sure what to put in, though. :s</p>
