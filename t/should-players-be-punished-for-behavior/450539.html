<p>Should players be punished for things like this?[/quote]</p>
<p>Assholes are all over the internet, so why should an abundance of them come as a surprise to you? You can see Runescape’s official rules <a href="http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Inappropriate_language_or_behaviour" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>; they have worked extremely well for them. As far as I can tell, most forms of disrespect aren’t included on there. As suggested by Jagex, the ignore list works well.</p>

I understand their rules and what they mean, and I’m not trying to be a nazi or anything, I’m just saying that I don’t want players who can actually help and contribute towards the community being driven away by letting players just harass whoever they want.</p>
<p>The ignore list works fine for verbal assaults, however doing anything else is unavoidable.  Going back to my example, people wold literally follow me around, attack me when I went in, farcast me, that sort of thing.  It’s also happened multiple times, on multiple servers, from multiple people, so it’s not me having one bad day.</p>
<p>My point though is that one should never be allowed to drive others away from the community just so they can feel all tall.  The same reason why this site has rules against flaming, I could make a thread about how retarded I think Tree is when it comes to women, however it would be locked, and myself muted.  I just don’t want my playerbase to be made of this kind of person, like allot are anymore because they really don’t give a fuck.</p>
<p>Also, this is mostly centered on pking servers, that’s where I see allot of different things happening like this.</p>

        <p>I never really liked the idea of a server where the staff team is breathing down peoples necks, a lot of the time a player runs up and goes “Tom! Tom! Person A said this to me!” or something that usually involves a player is pointing the finger at another player, so naturally, you go to the supposed offender and then they tell you a completely different story. It just isn’t an effective way of going about report handling.</p>
<p>I believe that for a start the community should be given some ability to deal with their own issues, for example (as mentioned above as well) a fully functioning ignore list. If somebody is being a massive asshole then they’re just going to get ignored by everyone until they get bored and give up. Though I will add that the ignore list should be easy to use and players should be made aware of its functionality (Perhaps an option under the players name or something?).</p>
<p>Secondly, my rule of thumb is this: Don’t enforce what you can fix with code. PVP servers are naturally competitive. I remember a friend of mine played a server where he would kill people and they would come back with just a weapon and cheap shot him, this caused him to get pretty pissy about it. You can avoid problems here by checking what items people have on before they enter the wilderness.</p>
<p>[ol][li]You avoid an annoyed player when they loose their stuff to somebody who just has a weapon. This player will go to the staff, the guy will most probably have no proof, nothing will be done, one more upset member of the community who is now mad at the management (That’s just how their brains work, I don’t know why).[/li]<br>
[li]You avoid revenege by the player using the same dirty tactics, simply because they can’t do it. Period.[/li]<br>
[li]The relationship between the two players is kept positive, the last thing you want is a community where everyone is fighting over something.[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>I also think that it is important you maintain the relationship between management -&gt; community. I don’t believe that moderators should log ingame, teleport to the player who’s been reported, and personally ban him. I think there should be a formal report form and a formal appeal form where the moderators can handle/read reports/ and punish anonymously. The idea of players collecting their own report information is one I don’t like either, most of the time they conveniently miss the part where they provoke the guy they’re reporting.</p>
<p>The issue with a lot of servers (especially PVP) is that when a moderator specifically punishes a member they assume its because they’ve killed them in PVP, or something like that. Just handle it like Jagex does.If a player has an issue, they can appeal and include the issue, it would be up to the administrators to chose the correct staff and ensure the correct process is being followed when it comes to handling them.</p>

</aside>
<p>What you have to remember is that this isn’t in real life, I remember where jail would prevent you logging out, they can just click X on the client, or end the process completely. If your server isn’t worth it to them, or they feel its unreasonable then they don’t have to stay, they just go elsewhere.</p>
<p>You can avoid ever needing to jail them at all just by changing how you, as a management interact with your community.</p>

        <p>[quote=“JavaTC, post:1, topic:450539”]Would servers be better if more action was taken towards those who act immaturely towards other players?  The reason I’m wondering is because when I start my server, I want to make sure as many as possible can enjoy it.  The worst part of a server for me was the fact that 50% of the players were assholes.</p>
<p>Example:  When I joined a pking server to relax after school, I would do a fight or two every now and then, but mostly watch fights and hang out on here or some other forums.  The problem was that, if someone would loose a fight (one of the immature kids), they would demand a rematch, but would not get off me whenever I would go into the wild.</p>
<p>I know it’s the wilderness, but should one person really be aloud to ruin other players’ days for their own ego gratification?</p>
<p>The main problem I see with this is the amount of moderation it would take.</p>
<p>Should players be punished for things like this?[/quote]</p>
<p>There’s assholes all over the interw3bz.<br>
It’s just something you’re going to have to deal with.<br>
However as Soulcist said, I don’t think THAT in particular is a reason to have a player punished.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the replies, wanted to see what people would even think if players were punished for this.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/tom-2.html">@Tom</a><br>
Fair enough, however I never intended for the whole “staff breathing down the players’ neck” type effect on this, it’s just for the occasion when a moderator catches someone being hostile or deliberately annoying, then they would have the right to take action.  I did consider the fact that allot of players would be the immature ‘tattle-tale’ type person though.</p>
