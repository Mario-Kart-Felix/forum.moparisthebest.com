    <title>Runescape Security Keys</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-security-keys/288033</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;While Jagex is a clear industry leader in making our games and infrastructure secure, some of our players’ personal computers have proved vulnerable to account hijacking in the form of viruses, key loggers, phishing websites or players simply revealing their Jagex password. Given these challenges, we are determined that your account remains secure at all times, even if your personal computer has been compromised or somebody else knows your password. We think we have found a solution to these problems: the Jagex security key.

This key looks like a bit like a USB dongle, which you will be able to put on your key ring or store in a secure location. The key will reveal a six to eight-digit code that changes every few seconds and is completely unique to you. Type this code into a Jagex login page and you will be able to guarantee that you are secure from any hijacking attempt.

For the techies out there, the key is an ‘Enterprise two-factor authentication solution’. We’re really enthusiastic about its potential to stop hijackers and phishing sites in their tracks, but since this will require significant investment and resources, we aren’t going to make any final decisions without talking to you first. We would like you to head over to the poll system, on the left-hand side of the RuneScape front page, and answer two questions: would you be interested in buying one of these security keys, and what is the most you would be willing to pay?

With the Jagex security key, we would be so confident that your account is secure that we could consider adding expanded bank space to those accounts that are protected by the Jagex security key.

NOTES – it would not be compulsory to buy the security key. It would be an optional means for you to keep your account genuinely secure. The Jagex security key would be available to all countries for a single one-off price. The security key would be available to both free players and members.

While we are enthusiastic about the Jagex security key, there are still a number of variables that could determine whether we can roll this out, ranging from technical challenges and, naturally, players&#39; interest in the device.

Please give us your feedback :)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not sure if this belongs in news section, I just thought it was different than the normal runescape stuff. Pretty interesting actually, but at the same time, they&#39;re marketing it as 100% secure. I think not :)

They change every 1-2mins. I have one for work atm, and it changes every 2 mins.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeh I did read an article along those lines, also a few pages on the wow forums which led me subject to beleive that there was some major flaw in blizzard system, in-which i stand corrected. Mopman is infact right in saying that there is no reported case’s of these devices failing.</p>
<p>I still keep by my previouse statement that they are a money making sceme, anyone dumb enough to get a keylogger or something along those lines is probly dumb enough to waste their money on one of these… but hey if you keep getting raped by keyloggers I guess this is a solution.</p>

              <p>warcraft allready has one of these, called the blizzard authenticator. I assure you it’s nothing more than a money making sceme -</p>
<p><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2008/06/blizzard_authenticator.jpg" alt width="" height=""></p>
<blockquote>===How the authenticator works===
<p>The Blizzard Authenticator is a token that you can put for example on your keychain. It has a little display that, once your press the button will generate a 6-digit number that changes every minute.</p>
<p>This number is used as a 1-time password. This means the password is only valid once. When you use it to log in, the code becomes invalid and any hacker trying to access your account later with the same number won’t be able to log in.</p>
<p>A hacker wanting to access your account will now, in addition to keylogging your username and password, have to physically break into your house and steal the authenticator to see what number it displays. But hackers are clever people. Isn’t there any way for them to know which number the authenticator is going to display? The answer is no, and here’s why.</p>
<p>Every authenticator has a little built-in clock. This clock keeps track of the number of seconds since, for example the WoW release date, Tigole’s birthday or whenever. Each authenticator also has a unique key, which it uses to encrypt this number of seconds into what looks like a completely random number. There is no way, without knowing the encryption key, to guess what number is going to be displayed at any point in time. Even if the hacker has all the numbers you entered before, he can’t extrapolate that into what number will be showing next.</p>
<p>The hacker also can’t hack into the device itself to find out it’s key, because it doesn’t connect to the computer in any way. Even if the hacker were the mailman who delivered the authenticator to your house, he would have to open it up and extract the hardware that contained the key. These devices are generally tamper-resistant and will purge themselves when opened.</p>
<p>So, if the hacker can’t know your 1-time password, how is Blizzard going to know? The difference is, Blizzard has the key for every authenticator they made. When you log in, blizzard looks up which authenticator is associated with your account, and finds the matching key. They then use this key to decrypt the number you entered into the number of seconds the authenticator has been counting. They then verify that this number matches the current time.</p>
<p>Even if the time on your authenticator doesn’t exactly match the time on blizzard’s server, they still allow you to log in within a minute or so of the defined time, just in case the clock in your authenticator is running a little slower or faster than normal. This still does not allow hackers to use the number from a minute ago, because when you log in successfully, that number is then disabled and prevented from being used again.</p>
<p>If you still think someone may eventually find a way around it, this security measure is used by businesses and government agencies around the world to provide security, and they have a lot more sensitive information to guard than the login information to a WoW account.</p>
