    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/haha-i-had-fun-with-this-one/199031</link>
    <description>Opened up gimp last night with a vision :). This is all paths tooling, coloring, paterens and the focal is a render. Took me ages to make it. C&amp;c , comment, w/e. The clock was path tooling and pattern filled, the trash can was path tooling and partern filled even the outlet and the paper on the wall where made from scratch.
