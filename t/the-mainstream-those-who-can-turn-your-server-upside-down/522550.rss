    <title>The Mainstream - Those who can turn your server upside-down</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-mainstream-those-who-can-turn-your-server-upside-down/522550</link>
    <description>The mainstream. They are the people who can make your server the best or the worst. If you don&#39;t plan your server according to their rules, your server can be blacked out in one second (Not literally, I am speaking in-terms of popularity). I have made this post to help you out with appealing the mainstream. After reading this, please take time to answer the poll at the top to help fellow members who wish to also appeal the mainstream. because, in a sense, YOU are also the mainstream! If I am looking at this topic and filled the poll, then the next person who reads this topic could read the statistics of the poll and count me in as one of the mainstream. [b]We all are mainstream! Well, in another owner&#39;s eyes.[/b]

[u]The mainstream? Go more in-depth![/u]
Take the mainstream like this:
[img]http://puu.sh/3m77r.png[/img]
There are 3 possibilities in this situation.

[ul][li]The shot - When the police shoots the person.[/li]
[li]Take in the car - When the police takes the guy in the car to go to jail.[/li]
[li]Spare - When the police just let you go.[/li][/ul]


You can think of these 3 possibilities just like the mainstream:

[ul][li]The shot - When the mainstream kills your server and leaves your server with only 1 or 2 people (and even those are just friends!).[/li]
[li]Take in the car - When the mainstream has some things to suffice them but not everything to suffice them to the extent where they join your server.[/li]
[li]Spare - When the mainstream is pleased with your server and start to reside there.[/li][/ul]


Generally speaking, the servers can be divided by hours of quality.

[ul][li]The shot - A server which only has 1 - 2 hours of stuff worth playing.[/li]
[li]Take in the car - A server which has 2 - 5 hours of stuff worth playing.[/li]
[li]Spare - A server which has 6+ hours of stuff worth playing.[/li][/ul]


Its all based on your will. Quality can defeat quantity. A good balance is perfect! the mainstream looks for a server with a bit more quality than quantity. Who would like to play a server with 300+ features but those things just take 1 minute to do? Nobody!

[u]Pleasing that mainstream![/u]
Here is where your vote in the poll counts. You see, in time, hopefully, that poll right up there may be filled with votes from the mainstream. You could finally please the mainstream like that!

However... that poll only states if they like oldschool or newschool servers.
For a more specific topic: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,553289.msg4053788.html#msg4053788]Which revision is more preferred over all (range 317 - 667)[/url]
For specifications on what to add feature-by-feature (Applies for newschoolers): Read on!
For specifications on what to add feature-by-feature (Applies for oldschoolers): Read on!

[u]Specifications[/u]
&quot;Okay, so can you tell me some specific, feature-by-feature, things to add to my server?&quot; 
- You

Sure! I am going to divide this into two (Oh boy, we really need a [spoiler] tag. If you wish so too, please support the movement for it: [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,639149.0.html]Adding [Spoiler] tag?[/url]).
[hr]
[u]New-schoolers (Revision 475+)[/u]
Ah, so you chose the new-school side? Meh, it requires a lot of work on your side, but if you can go through the barrier of hard work, success can surely come this route.

New-school servers should at least consist the following (not all, just some):
[code]
~ Run Orb/Rest
~ Holiday Events
~ Tool belt
~ advanced Dungeoneering system
~ Summoning Like RuneScape
~ Adding more charms to drop ratios
~ World Map icon
~ Perfected Combat System
~ MiniGames + Custom MiniGames
~ Some mapdata fixing {As an example -&gt; [url]http://i.imgur.com/zaGE5.png[/url]
~ New Interfaces {You can rip some off of cache&#39;s}
~ In-Game music + Audio options interface
~ Better armor interface {current one -&gt; [url]http://i.imgur.com/RHBh8.png[/url]
~ Emotes tab fixed
~ new Magic tab interfaces {Teleporting}
~ Closable chatbox and menu like RuneScape has
~ Custom skill
~ Armadyl Battlestaff
~ Polypore Staff {srry if spelt wrong, but you can sound it out}
~ New Magic attack anims/gfx
~ Help icon {redirecting you to the forum Guides -&gt; http://i.imgur.com/u8rvt.png
~ New Home? {Nezniot Island}
~ Fix sky from changing colors -&gt; http://i.imgur.com/tbUS6.png
~ Donator benifits {mini-games, quests, packages when purchasing: ags = $3) (if you have donator)
~ 99 call outs {ex: Frost Dagger just got 99 agility }
~ NPC kill-count command {tells you how many NPC&#39;s you&#39;ve killed }
~ Quests 
~ BRAND NEW armor looks {d&#39;hide,etc..| came out on Tuesday, march 6/2012}
~ All magic spells working {Modern, Ancients, Lunars}
~ Veteran, Complistment cape emotes like RuneScape available to players 
{Vetern = 5 months, complistment = all skills 99}
~ More Agility courses
~ New Skillcape emotes {like RuneScape}
~ Face North compass click
~ Ancient artifacts drop from killing someone in wilderness
~ Items kept on death {wealth carried}
~ Godwars requirements to enter dungeon {rope to enter dungeon itself, for for example Bandos -&gt; Hammer}
~ Inferno adze {when Woodcutting you get Firemaking exp as well}
~ Dragon Pickaxe for Mining
~ Ape atoll castle + NPC&#39;s {monkey&#39;s heal themselves too}
~ Advanced agility courses {ex: advanced gnome agility course}
~ Korasi multi hit
~ Thieving interfaces {To stop auto-clickers}
~ ALL Godswords + effects
~ Void + effects
~ Hand cannon with special hack 
~ Donators can have Titles (if you have donator)
~ More bosses {Avatar of destruction, Penace Queen,etc..}
~ Donator island (if you have donator)
~ New training zones
~ Slayer tasks {Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite}
~ Reduce lag
~ Nex with all features
~ Never before seen home/areas
~ Always update-to-date with RuneScape
[/code]
[size=7pt](Credits: [url=http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/389678-what-makes-rsps-best.html]What Makes A RSPS Best?[/url])[/size]
It&#39;s surely a long list, and a hard one, but as I said, success can be made from hard work.

Quality: [b]9/10[/b]
Quantity: [b]10/10[/b]
Difficulty: [b]10/10[/b]
Approximately how many programmers probably needed for this: [b]3 - 10 (Just due to the fact that it always needs to be up-to-date with RuneScape)[/b]
[hr]
[u]Old-Schoolers (194 - 474)[/u]
The old-school route is easier compared to the new-school route. You will also get quite a good, bulky player base with this as this involves going back in time instead of following the present.

[b]NOTE: The con about old-school is that, in-time, the old-school player base will weaken just due to the fact that people may forget and such. If you are thinking a HUGE, VERY LONG TERM server, don&#39;t consider old-school as your main goal.[/b]

Old-school servers should try to have the following:
[code]
~ Clan Chat
~ All working skills (be glad you don&#39;t have to do Dungeoneering)
~ A nice combat system
~ That oldschool feeling (I just cannot describe this!)
~ Music and sounds (be sure to make it adjustable)
~ Stay with your revision!
~ Either make the dialogues unique or like RS, we don&#39;t want random jibber.
~ Cutscenes
~ Nice add-ons (Like the easter ring turning you to an egg)
~ Make sure the NPCs are meaningful where-ever they are. I absolutely hate when I go on a server and see some NPC walking around, and when I talk to them, it does nothing!
~ Fix your examine texts! Really, its in the cache or can be handles client-sided. I hate when I examine an object, it says, &quot;Its an Tree.&quot;
~ All, if not most, minigames.
~ Quests (That can really make an oldschool feel)
~ A nice home (Such as Lumbridge, and if you are using 474, Neitiznot)
~ Shops where you cant get anything you want just from there
~ Special loyalty to long-term members
[/code]
That&#39;s all I can think of as of right now.

Quality: [b]8-10/10[/b]
Quantity: [b]6/10 (&quot;~ That oldschool feeling (I just cannot describe this!)&quot; should increase the quantity. A lot of you know more than me)[/b]
Difficulty: [b]8/10[/b]
Approximately how many programmers probably needed for this: [b]2 - 5[/b]
[hr]
[u]Finished?[/u]
Thank you for reading this thread and please put it into consideration. Now why not do me, and somebody else a favor and vote on the poll. That way, you may probably get that good luck charm for success. ;)

[u]Just a key note[/u]
There are 5 attributes to make a server have success:

[ul][li]You need something unique
[/li][li]You can&#39;t be greedy for money, or have any intentions of making a RSPS just for making money[/li]
[li]You need to make sure everything is consistent, in terms of Quality, in your RSPS.[/li]
[li]You need to maintain a Clean look - So no spelling mistakes, etc.[/li]
[li]You have to actually plan what type of RSPS you want, and the reasons why. Remember; you can&#39;t go back.[/li][/ul]

Keep these and mind and you&#39;ll be rollin&#39; all the time!

[b]Quick conclusion tip: Take a good look at NPC lists, coordinate lists, and emote lists. It can be very helpful![/b]</description>

              <p>I’m not entirely sure what to make of this. This seems to just be an opinionated “informative” thread. There’s no real discussion, and no input from others besides the fact you have a poll. Anyone can make an oldschool server with much more content than a “newschool” server does. So, your lists are inaccurate. I will agree, on the other hand, that if you wish to have a successful server, you do need to make content that adds hours of gameplay to it.</p>

              <p>The mainstream. They are the people who can make your server the best or the worst. If you don’t plan your server according to their rules, your server can be blacked out in one second (Not literally, I am speaking in-terms of popularity). I have made this post to help you out with appealing the mainstream. After reading this, please take time to answer the poll at the top to help fellow members who wish to also appeal the mainstream. because, in a sense, YOU are also the mainstream! If I am looking at this topic and filled the poll, then the next person who reads this topic could read the statistics of the poll and count me in as one of the mainstream. <span class="bbcode-b">We all are mainstream! Well, in another owner’s eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">The mainstream? Go more in-depth!</span><br>
Take the mainstream like this:<br>
<img src="http://puu.sh/3m77r.png" alt width="550" height="385"><br>
There are 3 possibilities in this situation.</p>
<p>[ul][li]The shot - When the police shoots the person.[/li]<br>
[li]Take in the car - When the police takes the guy in the car to go to jail.[/li]<br>
[li]Spare - When the police just let you go.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>You can think of these 3 possibilities just like the mainstream:</p>
<p>[ul][li]The shot - When the mainstream kills your server and leaves your server with only 1 or 2 people (and even those are just friends!).[/li]<br>
[li]Take in the car - When the mainstream has some things to suffice them but not everything to suffice them to the extent where they join your server.[/li]<br>
[li]Spare - When the mainstream is pleased with your server and start to reside there.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the servers can be divided by hours of quality.</p>
<p>[ul][li]The shot - A server which only has 1 - 2 hours of stuff worth playing.[/li]<br>
[li]Take in the car - A server which has 2 - 5 hours of stuff worth playing.[/li]<br>
[li]Spare - A server which has 6+ hours of stuff worth playing.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Its all based on your will. Quality can defeat quantity. A good balance is perfect! the mainstream looks for a server with a bit more quality than quantity. Who would like to play a server with 300+ features but those things just take 1 minute to do? Nobody!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Pleasing that mainstream!</span><br>
Here is where your vote in the poll counts. You see, in time, hopefully, that poll right up there may be filled with votes from the mainstream. You could finally please the mainstream like that!</p>
<p>However… that poll only states if they like oldschool or newschool servers.<br>
For a more specific topic: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,553289.msg4053788.html#msg4053788" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Which revision is more preferred over all (range 317 - 667)</a><br>
For specifications on what to add feature-by-feature (Applies for newschoolers): Read on!<br>
For specifications on what to add feature-by-feature (Applies for oldschoolers): Read on!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Specifications</span><br>
“Okay, so can you tell me some specific, feature-by-feature, things to add to my server?”</p>
<ul>
<li>You</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure! I am going to divide this into two (Oh boy, we really need a [spoiler] tag. If you wish so too, please support the movement for it: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,639149.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Adding [Spoiler] tag?</a>).<br>

<span class="bbcode-u">New-schoolers (Revision 475+)</span><br>
Ah, so you chose the new-school side? Meh, it requires a lot of work on your side, but if you can go through the barrier of hard work, success can surely come this route.</p>
<p>New-school servers should at least consist the following (not all, just some):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">~ Run Orb/Rest
~ Holiday Events
~ Tool belt
~ advanced Dungeoneering system
~ Summoning Like RuneScape
~ Adding more charms to drop ratios
~ World Map icon
~ Perfected Combat System
~ MiniGames + Custom MiniGames
~ Some mapdata fixing {As an example -&gt; [url]http://i.imgur.com/zaGE5.png[/url]
~ New Interfaces {You can rip some off of cache's}
~ In-Game music + Audio options interface
~ Better armor interface {current one -&gt; [url]http://i.imgur.com/RHBh8.png[/url]
~ Emotes tab fixed
~ new Magic tab interfaces {Teleporting}
~ Closable chatbox and menu like RuneScape has
~ Custom skill
~ Armadyl Battlestaff
~ Polypore Staff {srry if spelt wrong, but you can sound it out}
~ New Magic attack anims/gfx
~ Help icon {redirecting you to the forum Guides -&gt; http://i.imgur.com/u8rvt.png
~ New Home? {Nezniot Island}
~ Fix sky from changing colors -&gt; http://i.imgur.com/tbUS6.png
~ Donator benifits {mini-games, quests, packages when purchasing: ags = $3) (if you have donator)
~ 99 call outs {ex: Frost Dagger just got 99 agility }
~ NPC kill-count command {tells you how many NPC's you've killed }
~ Quests 
~ BRAND NEW armor looks {d'hide,etc..| came out on Tuesday, march 6/2012}
~ All magic spells working {Modern, Ancients, Lunars}
~ Veteran, Complistment cape emotes like RuneScape available to players 
{Vetern = 5 months, complistment = all skills 99}
~ More Agility courses
~ New Skillcape emotes {like RuneScape}
~ Face North compass click
~ Ancient artifacts drop from killing someone in wilderness
~ Items kept on death {wealth carried}
~ Godwars requirements to enter dungeon {rope to enter dungeon itself, for for example Bandos -&gt; Hammer}
~ Inferno adze {when Woodcutting you get Firemaking exp as well}
~ Dragon Pickaxe for Mining
~ Ape atoll castle + NPC's {monkey's heal themselves too}
~ Advanced agility courses {ex: advanced gnome agility course}
~ Korasi multi hit
~ Thieving interfaces {To stop auto-clickers}
~ ALL Godswords + effects
~ Void + effects
~ Hand cannon with special hack 
~ Donators can have Titles (if you have donator)
~ More bosses {Avatar of destruction, Penace Queen,etc..}
~ Donator island (if you have donator)
~ New training zones
~ Slayer tasks {Easy, Medium, Hard, Elite}
~ Reduce lag
~ Nex with all features
~ Never before seen home/areas
~ Always update-to-date with RuneScape</code></pre>
<p>[size=7pt](Credits: <a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/389678-what-makes-rsps-best.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">What Makes A RSPS Best?</a>)[/size]<br>
It’s surely a long list, and a hard one, but as I said, success can be made from hard work.</p>
<p>Quality: <span class="bbcode-b">9/10</span><br>
Quantity: <span class="bbcode-b">10/10</span><br>
Difficulty: <span class="bbcode-b">10/10</span><br>
Approximately how many programmers probably needed for this: <span class="bbcode-b">3 - 10 (Just due to the fact that it always needs to be up-to-date with RuneScape)</span><br>
[hr]<br>
<span class="bbcode-u">Old-Schoolers (194 - 474)</span><br>
The old-school route is easier compared to the new-school route. You will also get quite a good, bulky player base with this as this involves going back in time instead of following the present.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">NOTE: The con about old-school is that, in-time, the old-school player base will weaken just due to the fact that people may forget and such. If you are thinking a HUGE, VERY LONG TERM server, don’t consider old-school as your main goal.</span></p>
<p>Old-school servers should try to have the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">~ Clan Chat
~ All working skills (be glad you don't have to do Dungeoneering)
~ A nice combat system
~ That oldschool feeling (I just cannot describe this!)
~ Music and sounds (be sure to make it adjustable)
~ Stay with your revision!
~ Either make the dialogues unique or like RS, we don't want random jibber.
~ Cutscenes
~ Nice add-ons (Like the easter ring turning you to an egg)
~ Make sure the NPCs are meaningful where-ever they are. I absolutely hate when I go on a server and see some NPC walking around, and when I talk to them, it does nothing!
~ Fix your examine texts! Really, its in the cache or can be handles client-sided. I hate when I examine an object, it says, "Its an Tree."
~ All, if not most, minigames.
~ Quests (That can really make an oldschool feel)
~ A nice home (Such as Lumbridge, and if you are using 474, Neitiznot)
~ Shops where you cant get anything you want just from there
~ Special loyalty to long-term members</code></pre>
<p>That’s all I can think of as of right now.</p>
<p>Quality: <span class="bbcode-b">8-10/10</span><br>
Quantity: <span class="bbcode-b">6/10 ("~ That oldschool feeling (I just cannot describe this!)" should increase the quantity. A lot of you know more than me)</span><br>
Difficulty: <span class="bbcode-b">8/10</span><br>
Approximately how many programmers probably needed for this: <span class="bbcode-b">2 - 5</span><br>

<span class="bbcode-u">Finished?</span><br>
Thank you for reading this thread and please put it into consideration. Now why not do me, and somebody else a favor and vote on the poll. That way, you may probably get that good luck charm for success. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Just a key note</span><br>
There are 5 attributes to make a server have success:</p>
<p>[ul][li]You need something unique<br>
[/li][li]You can’t be greedy for money, or have any intentions of making a RSPS just for making money[/li]<br>
[li]You need to make sure everything is consistent, in terms of Quality, in your RSPS.[/li]<br>
[li]You need to maintain a Clean look - So no spelling mistakes, etc.[/li]<br>
[li]You have to actually plan what type of RSPS you want, and the reasons why. Remember; you can’t go back.[/li][/ul]</p>

Keep these and mind and you’ll be rollin’ all the time!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Quick conclusion tip: Take a good look at NPC lists, coordinate lists, and emote lists. It can be very helpful!</span></p>
