    <title>What are you addicted to Moparscape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-are-you-addicted-to-moparscape/542323</link>
    <description>This is always a fun topic, you can post one thing, two things, five, ten, doesn&#39;t matter. Extra cookie points for stating why/how it all started. Don&#39;t be worried if you&#39;re addicted to meth or something, hopefully people are more mature on here to not be judgmental, addictions can be hard. My addictions:

[b]First (not-so-bad) Addiction: Alcohol[/b]
- Though this isn&#39;t my worse addiction, I do like drinking on occasions. However, it has gotten to the point of being pointless. It takes a lot of alcohol to get &quot;buzzed&quot;. This is partly because I have a high tolerance built up by now, and my build/weight. For those of you who enjoy drinking, some of my favorite drinks:
- Hartley Brandy (very cheap brandy, easier to get buzzed off)
- Circoc (usually only drink this when I have a ton of money)
- New Amsterdam (Vodka - The berry/coconut are my favorite, but just straight NA Vodka isn&#39;t so bad)
- Fleischmann&#39;s Vodka (this stuff really fucks you up)

I&#39;m not really sure how this started, but it has been going on for just under three years. Consequences: 1 under-age drinking ticket (friend was giving me a ride home at 3a, was barely buzzed, he pulled an extremely legal U-turn, got pulled over, cops smelled alcohol, yada dada.), probably some damage to my liver too. 

[b]Second (moderate addiction) Smoking [i]Cigars[/i]:[/b]
- Most people are addicted to smoking cigarettes, but, I recently found myself addicted to cigars. This started about a year ago after being at a school of people who constantly smoke cigarettes. My girlfriend smokes, my older brother, and both of my parents used to. I figured why not try it? I started off with buying cigarillos and smoking those, my favorite being black n&#39; mild wine. I smoked cigarillos for maybe 5-6 months. When I didn&#39;t find them strong enough, I found these &quot;little cigars&quot; they&#39;re no better or worse than cigarettes (not sure really) but they&#39;re pretty damn strong. They&#39;re menthol (if you want) or flavored (vanilla, cherry, blueberry, cinnamon, anything), they come in packs of twenty looking like cigarettes. I smoke half a pack to 3/4 a pack in a day. The best part about these little menthol flavored cigars is that, they&#39;re cheap! While a pack of cigarettes (newports) is about $8.00USD (Wisconsin), these little cigars are sold in gas stations for $2.50-$3.00. I usually buy mine online ($12.50 a carton comes out to $1.25/pack). Anyways, I know this is somewhat an addiction. But lately it has been fading away, I don&#39;t feel the need to smoke anymore and instead of smoking a full cigar, I usually only smoke half in one sitting. I have smoked cigarettes and I&#39;ll sometimes hit my girlfriends cigarette if I don&#39;t have cigars, to this day, I hate the taste. 

[b]Third (this is by far my worst addiction) Energy Drinks:[/b]
- This started six or seven years ago.. I pretty much live off energy drinks. I don&#39;t get much sleep at night (I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m an insomniac, but I don&#39;t really care.) So when I wake up I&#39;ll have an energy drink. At least one per day, in the past year there has probably only been a week where I haven&#39;t had an energy drink to wake up to. It was the worst in middleschool, drinking up to seven throughout the day. I found that they kept me wired and focused the whole day. But also made my anger act up (which I countered with smoking). I&#39;ve narrowed it down to a 24oz. Monster every morning. The main energy drink I drink is Monster Energy, however, I built up a &quot;tolerance&quot; after a while and I started to get light-headed and throw up from the smell of one, I switch to Amp for a few months, and went back to monsters. What truly makes this an addiction is the fact that I cannot stop. I have tried on my own, I have been mostly forced to by an order from a doctor (I would wake up in the middle of the night, and throw up) doctor thought it was caffeine, I stopped all caffeine for a few weeks, it still happened. Thought it was a lactose intolerant, stopped lactose/dairy intake for a few weeks, didn&#39;t help. The throwing up randomly had eventually went away, not sure what it was. Anyways, this addiction has probably made a big impact on my health, I get occasional pains in my chest (near my heart) which probably isn&#39;t good. 

[b]Fourth Addiction (I don&#39;t find this a problem) spending time with my girlfriend:[/b]
- This started.. Well, a year and half ago when we started dating. I could never find anything that makes me happy, I finally found something, and that&#39;s spending time with someone that I care about. Whether we&#39;re sitting there watching movies, gardening, painting her room (that was a cluster fuck) taking walks to the beaches, going out to lunch, etc. I&#39;m always stress free when I&#39;m around her. And I do realize that it&#39;s partially an addiction. It sucks not being around her, and the past year we have spent almost every day together. 
Pros:

[ul][li]Relieves my stress.[/li]
[li]I lost all anger problems, I don&#39;t really get angry anymore.[/li]
[li]Keeps my calm and relaxed.[/li]
[li]It&#39;s fun taking walks, going to the beach, etc.[/li]
[li]Makes me feel a little more grown up.[/li][/ul]

Cons:

[ul][li]My parents don&#39;t like it. They like her, but they don&#39;t like the fact that I spend almost every night at her house, and not at mine. This is partially because my parents are usually arguing and I don&#39;t want to be around that. My girlfriend&#39;s mom is usually at work, and her dad is in jail over stuff that happened 20 years ago. So it&#39;s usually just me and her at her house, it starts to feel like we live together on our own. My parents always bring up the fact that I&#39;m only 16 (17 in two months) and I shouldn&#39;t have this much freedom, but oh well. Some people mature quicker than others. For reference: my girlfriend is turning 19 in a few months (July)[/li]
[li]She is obsessed with animals, which isn&#39;t a problem. But she doesn&#39;t like computers, and when I work (work from home) she usually doesn&#39;t like sitting there by herself as I&#39;m working. But, I&#39;m teaching her more and more about computers/website development.[/li][/ul]

Anyways, the pros completely out-weigh the cons.


[u][b]tl;dr - Alcohol, Smoking Cigars, Energy Drinks, and hanging out with my girlfriend.[/b][/u]</description>

              <p>@ op - i knew someone else that was addicted to energy drinks and was forced to stop, and their liver was so fucked up their doctor said only water and very light drinks for the rest of their life</p>
<p>you really need to try and find a way to fix that before it gets to that point for you</p>
<p>Anyways my addiction would just be the computer/internet in general. I am pretty well rounded when it comes to what I do on the computer, but I spend wayyyy too much time on it.</p>
