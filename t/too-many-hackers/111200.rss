    <description>
These days just arent as good as they used too be, hackers are around the corner on every site..I&#39;ve recently been checking my Firewall security risks, 33 people since 1st of june have ( is when i made my server) have been trying too get into my network/computer..its UNBELIEVEABLE, im forcing my self too QUIT my server and delete it, but im not that mean, i wont delete but i will take it away for good, its horrible what people these days are doing, no wonder over 20,000 people in a month on RS get banned let alone what about Mopar? hmm..its pathetic.

This topic is leading too the advice that needs too be given, when you make you&#39;re server, be carfull of what you&#39;re dealing with, it could be you&#39;re bankaccount or ur RS pass that may be in RISK, TAKE note of what you&#39;re doing, let alone the portforwarding, where can i start? its a hackers paradise when someone does it.

BE VERY WARY OF WHAT YOU&#39;RE DOING PEOPLE, THIS ISNT A JOKE.
