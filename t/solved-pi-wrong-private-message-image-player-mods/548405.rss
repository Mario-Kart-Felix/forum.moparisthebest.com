    <title>[Solved] [PI] Wrong Private Message Image (Player Mods)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/solved-pi-wrong-private-message-image-player-mods/548405</link>
    <description>Hey, I have another seriously annoying problem.

When a player mod private messages anyone, they appear to have a donator icon rather than the silver crown next to their name:

How do I fix this?</description>

              <p>This isn’t server sided…</p>
<p>In client.java in your client, look for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"></code></pre>
<p>In that method, you’ll find something similar to:</p>
<p><code>				if (s != null &amp;&amp; s.startsWith("@cr1@")) {
					s = s.substring(5);
					byte1 = 1;
				}</code><br>
There’s gonna be a few of them. <a class="mention" href="/u/cr1">@cr1</a>@ is the text used to determine the player rights of the player sending you a message. byte1 the player rights, this number will be used to determine what mod icon is showing.<br>
s is the the name of the player.<br>
A little bit lower, you’ll find:</p>
<p><code>
					if (byte1 == 1) {
						modIcons[0].drawSprite(k1, l - 12);
						k1 += 12;
					}</code><br>
As you can see, this is drawing modIcons[0] for playerRights of 1.<br>
modIcons[0] is typically a silver crown in the cache, unless you packed new sprites or are loading them externally, then it’s whatever you put at index 0…</p>
<p>So basically, all you have to do is make sure that data lines up.</p>
<p>If donators are rights 4, then make sure <span class="mention">@cr4</span>@ exists, and is drawing modIcons[3].</p>
<p>Chances are this is your issue: You’re loading sprites externally, from .PNGs.<br>
MODICONS 0.PNG is a red donator crown in your sprites.<br>
And you probably have this EXACT code in your client:</p>
<p><code>
					if (byte1 == 1) {
						modIcons[0].drawSprite(k1, l - 12);
						k1 += 12;
					}</code><br>
Your solution would be to change the [0 ] to [1] probably. As MODICONS 1.PNG is probably your moderator icon.</p>
