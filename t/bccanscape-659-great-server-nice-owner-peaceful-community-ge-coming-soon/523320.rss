    <description>This Server Just Got Put Up Yesterday, and I am looking for players to come and join me in BCCANSCAPE.

This server is a fairly decent server, and i am adding penguins in about a week or so... Idk if this is correct but i heard penguins are popular in rsps&#39;s. (Correct me if im wrong).
As far as staff... I am not hiring people right off the bat because i need players more than i need staff members.
Once i have a decent amount of players, i start choosing staff by who has been a big help to the server.

ATM i have to have a downloadable client due to website issues. My webclient should be up and running in about a week or 2. 
here is the link to my downloadable client https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/84236205/BCCANSCAPE.jar Thanx :D.
Sorry for the DL client, i just dont know any other way. :l
My website is [url=http://Bccantech.net]Bccantech.net[/url] but dont bother clicking on bccanscape, it does not work as i described above.
Webclient is here for now [url=http://www.bccanscape.webs.com]www.bccanscape.webs.com[/url]
Thank you all who decide to give my server a try.
