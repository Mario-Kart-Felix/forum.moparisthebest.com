    <description>alright.. I know this probably isn&#39;t in the right place.. but I CANNOT FIND A PLACE TO PUT THIS TOPIC!!!

ok. I have a good client and server.. they are supposed to go together.. but every time I go to get on it from the client.. it doesn&#39;t work.. it always says error connecting to server.. I have done everything in those tutorials on here... and it still doesn&#39;t work!


this is in the GUI.java in the client....

this is also in the GUI.java IN THE CLIENT..

and this is in the server crap.. [sup]there are 3 slots for this..[/sup][sub]well with the[/sub] [code]if (server.equals(&quot;***.*.*.*&quot;) || server.equals(&quot;localhost&quot;)) {[/code]
[IMG]http://i360.photobucket.com/albums/oo47/perez048/help-me-1.png[/img]
do I LEAVE THEM AS, AS? or do I change the ***.*.*.* to my server name... the ***.*.*.* is 127.0.0.1 so..

I can&#39;t find anything else that has to do with connecting to eachother.. I&#39;ve done port forwarding.. no-ip.. ect..

I need to know.. it does NOT work with others.. I can get on to see what it&#39;s like and everything.. but no body else has. I had gotten on my other pc, and sent the client over.. and it doesn&#39;t work.. but I can get on with no problem.. I want to know how to get it to work with OTHER computers.. WITHOUT the server data!</description>

              <p>Well, In you Server Files are the ip’s the same.<br>
If it is the base of another server go into client.java search No-Ip.<br>
THen change the old oone to yours.</p>
<p>If not that. then go into server.java sarch no-ip and change that as well.</p>
<p>IF not those then check your server configueration file and see if this is what  says.</p>
