    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcs-and-items-disappearing/16510</link>
    <description>i have a cheezscape v80 server that i have modified alot. has anyone had a problem where their NPCs and Items were disappearing? i already reinstalled moparscape and tried the web client, but did not effect the disappearence at all. i&#39;m currently looking into fixing this, but not sure if its server side or client side?

thanks
