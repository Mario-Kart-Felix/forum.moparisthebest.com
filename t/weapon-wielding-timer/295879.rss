    <title>Weapon Wielding Timer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/weapon-wielding-timer/295879</link>
    <description>Okay, so most of you know, in most private servers there&#39;s a dds glitch. It&#39;s when you dds spec, and have a secondary weapon, like an AGS, ready to switch to. Upon switching to it, instead of the spec finishing, it hits once, then once with the gs, tricking it to think the gs was the other part of the spec. Then it continues and hits immediately after, causing a K0. I&#39;d like to know, how I can make a timer, so that if they had just specced, they can&#39;t wield anything else for 5 seconds. Or a way so that it COMPLETELY finishes the spec, before allowing you to switch weapons. Thanks greatly appreciated =]</description>
