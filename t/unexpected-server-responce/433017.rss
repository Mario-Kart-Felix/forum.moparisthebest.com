    <title>Unexpected server responce?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/unexpected-server-responce/433017</link>
    <description>Alright, I thought i did everything right but, then it started saying this &quot;Unexpected server responce, please try a different level&quot;. I don&#39;t know what the hell that means. Iv&#39;e been told that means that you&#39;r server isn&#39;t online but, im pretty sure it is cause it&#39;s running the bottom

Every time i click the logon button on the webclient i made on Rswebclients it says connection recieved from and then my IP address... I downloaded No-Ip and made a host and stuff and i have it checked in the DUC whilst the server source is running in the bottom but, when i click to logon it says the unexpected server responce thing...can someone please help me?  I would prefer teamviewer but, any type of help would suffice. thanks for reading :) -Shea</description>

              <p>Unexpected server response is when your server sends a few bytes which the client isn’t configured to read them. Are you using the right source? Is UID checking enforced?</p>
