    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/video-advice/530438</link>
    <description>I am not entirely sure which board this fits in. In one sense it&#39;s graphics in another, it isn&#39;t so please move this if you see fit.

Long story short, Kieran and I are are making a gaming commentary/guide/general gaming youtube channel and I am not entirely sure exactly what I need to use/have no experience with video editing for the most part.

To make this the easiest on me I have made a mini layout you don&#39;t have to use it but well this is just how I am sort of layout minded I guess. 

1) What programs to record with? 

2) What programs can I use to record 1080p? (or at least 720p even though 1080 preferred)

3) What programs do I need to edit the videos? (these are going to be &quot;professional&quot; style edited videos so I know there will be practice involved in using the programs etc so please list the better ones don&#39;t just say windows movie maker if it can&#39;t help to do whatever I need it to do lol) 

4) Any good tutorials you can link me to? :) I am always willing to learn!

5) I assume one of the programs from #3 would be used but... how do I make a youtube intro? 


5) Any other advice you can supply?</description>

Hm? Are you making a website also?<br>

<p>We plan to livestream and make a website at a later date. We first want to get some variety in gaming videos completed. We are still in very early stages at the moment.</p>

Dreamweaver? photoshop would be better for small frame edits. premiere is abit less user friendly than sony vegas but in my opinion perhaps more efficient.<br>
I just use fraps or bandicam for recording. Camstasia is kinda useless to me<br>
[/quote]like I mentioned earlier I have no prior experience with editing/recording that’s why the point of this topic. I have fraps but I have been told you can’t record longer than 10 minutes so that may be an issue in specific games?</p>
<p>I have… acquired premiere as well but I am unsure of how to do use any of the programs. I really need some good tutorials/guides to get started.[/quote]<br>
what really?(i have used fraps on chrome, war3, star2,bf2,bf3, mirrors edge,rs2andrs3) I have 25 minute clips using fraps. thats about how long i game per session as i am not a hard core advocate of gaming.<br>
Frap files are although, pretty large…</p>
