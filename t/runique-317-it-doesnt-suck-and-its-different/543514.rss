    <title>Runique 317 - It doesn&#39;t suck and it&#39;s different</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runique-317-it-doesnt-suck-and-its-different/543514</link>
    <description>Note: I am in no way affiliated with the people at http://runique.org. Check them out, their server is great. It was my fault for not checking if the name was already taken.

Runique is my attempt at getting away from the standard Private Server and trying to form new ideas about how Private Servers can be played.

Runique is a spawn server, but not in the traditional sense. Items have to be unlocked in tiers, which is the main use of the game&#39;s point system.

Most skills are minigame based, due to the ability to spawn, which is nice alternative to simply grinding away, using items on one another or clicking an object over and over again. (All the skills function properly, I&#39;m not a dingus)

There are a few custom bosses to fight, such as this little bastard:

As well as quite a few custom items, which can be seen [url=http://runique.x10.bz/index.php?topic=6.0]here.[/url]

I would say one of the best features of Runique is the atmosphere. If you just want to play a fun, easy going server with a relaxed, fun loving staff, come join. We want to be as big of a part of a community as we can, so we try to be as friendly as possible. (Unless, of course, you are a dingus)

I don&#39;t know that stupid &quot;approved links only&quot; rule is still in place, but whatever. Go here: http://runique.x10.bz/index.php and come play. It&#39;ll be fun.</description>
