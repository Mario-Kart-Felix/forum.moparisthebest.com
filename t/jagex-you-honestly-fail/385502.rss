    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-you-honestly-fail/385502</link>
    <description>Well, i was going through my recent emails and found this email from jagex. I dont know if this has been posted yet, if it has then im sorry. But i&#39;m very curious about this. Did it happen to any of you? And why do you think it happened? Leave a comment below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Player,

We regret to inform you that your account has received an infraction due to a Macroing offense.
Please visit the appeal section under Account Management to view evidence of your infraction(s) and to appeal any infraction(s) that you feel were unjustified.

To view the evidence please click here: http://secure.runescape.com/m=weblogin/loginform.ws?mod=offence-appeal&amp;ssl=1&amp;expired=0&amp;dest=account_history.ws 

Please note: Due to a recent bug in our infraction system, some accounts may have received a void infraction. The majority of void infractions have been removed but we cannot ensure that all infractions have been removed. We urge you to visit the appeal section to appeal any unjustified infractions received due to system errors.the &#39;Safety and Security&#39; section of the website.

Many thanks,
Jagex Ltd.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>i got the same thing but it was real world trading, they said it was perm ban when i logged in onto runescape appeal thing it was scratched out… i went to the site as soon as i got the message while i was on msn</p>

<p>Mine too… A lot of people’s e-mails have been acquired <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"><br>
Actually, I noticed the e-mails starting being sent to me when I rejoined powerbot again.</p>

              <p>[quote=“asshole_rule, post:1, topic:385502”]Well, i was going through my recent emails and found this email from jagex. I dont know if this has been posted yet, if it has then im sorry. But i’m very curious about this. Did it happen to any of you? And why do you think it happened? Leave a comment below.</p>

Dear Player,</p>
<p>We regret to inform you that your account has received an infraction due to a Macroing offense.<br>
Please visit the appeal section under Account Management to view evidence of your infraction(s) and to appeal any infraction(s) that you feel were unjustified.</p>
<p>To view the evidence please click here: <a href="http://secure.runescape.com/m=weblogin/loginform.ws?mod=offence-appeal&amp;ssl=1&amp;expired=0&amp;dest=account_history.ws" rel="nofollow noopener">http://secure.runescape.com/m=weblogin/loginform.ws?mod=offence-appeal&amp;ssl=1&amp;expired=0&amp;dest=account_history.ws</a></p>
<p>Please note: Due to a recent bug in our infraction system, some accounts may have received a void infraction. The majority of void infractions have been removed but we cannot ensure that all infractions have been removed. We urge you to visit the appeal section to appeal any unjustified infractions received due to system errors.the ‘Safety and Security’ section of the website.</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br>
Jagex Ltd.[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>The link was masked. I can spot a few errors in the email, and it would be the same as me putting <a href="http://scamsite.org" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">runescape.com</a> (mouseover the link or quote me to see what the link really is).</p>
