    <title>[PI] Webclient works but white!?!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-webclient-works-but-white/433755</link>
    <description>Hello guys,
I worked today on my webclient PI. when i was finished everything worked only the Webclient when it was downloading till it extracted was white!
I hope someone got a code so the downloaded % shows in Client! 

Error 2:

If i run the Webclient only the .jar file it works loading.
On HTTP page i get the java error major minor error. 
I really ask me to fix this issue.


Best regards</description>
