    <title>Looking for hoster OR help hosting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-hoster-or-help-hosting/508275</link>
    <description>Not sure where to put this topic, so I just put it here. I am looking for a hoster or someone to help me with hosting. I&#39;ve worked on it for about 3 days now, got help from 2 people and it still doesn&#39;t work. They have said that I have all the files and portforwarding and everything done correctly and they don&#39;t know how to do it. If you can host, but you have no experience, that is completely okay! Just teamviewer with me or something and I&#39;ll be GLAD to do it all for you with the reward of co-owner! If you can help me with my hosting issue, you will be offered co-owner or admin (probably co-owner). Thanks for reading.</description>
