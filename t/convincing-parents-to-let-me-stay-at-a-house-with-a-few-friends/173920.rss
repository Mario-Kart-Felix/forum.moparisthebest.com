    <title>Convincing parents to let me stay at a house with a few friends?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/convincing-parents-to-let-me-stay-at-a-house-with-a-few-friends/173920</link>
    <description>My b&#39;day is coming up real soon, and I want to have a few mates at a &#39;spare&#39; house. (It&#39;s my Uncle&#39;s who has moved to America, yet he still pays for this house). Mum said the usual &#39;I&#39;ll think about it,&#39; so I&#39;m worried that&#39;s a way of holding me off for a no. The house is a 15 min drive away, and has 2 bedrooms. I want to stay there for a Friday and Saturday night, and come back home on the Sunday. This is for my birthday, but I don&#39;t think my mum or dad will let me. Any tips/suggestions/ideas on how to make them change their mind? I&#39;ll be 16 when it happens. 

No stupid replies please :)

Thanks :)</description>

              <p>I have found it useful to prove to my parents that I am mature enough to keep the responsibility. offer something like they can call you every hour and have you check in with them or tell them that they can stop by when ever they want. Thats all I can think of right now. So yea. good luck. OH! and Happy 16th Birthday!</p>

A is Good<br>
B is Still good just not as good as above (ofc).<br>
C is considered a pass<br>
D is considered a Minimal pass<br>

<p>I’ll try the whole trust thing. No girls are going that I want to shag, but their will be some alcohol and some pot. I can’t get into the spare house because I don’t have the keys or the alarm security code.</p>

              <p>Considering none of the members here know your mum or dad I don’t think we are in a position to tell you how to convince them. Everyones parents are different so you will have different methods.</p>
<p>Throw a tantrum, swear and cut yourself. Say you found a different place then on your birthday go to the spare house with your friends, then they would think “oh he found teh different place!”</p>
<p>Just say “trust me” or try to speak on their level. Put yourself in their shoes, would you as a parent let your 16 year old son just be alone for 3 days with friends and no supervision. They will probably be worried about sex and drugs. Especially sex because as you’re turning 16 they might think you want to lose your virginity quickly.</p>
<p>Just some thoughts, not many good ideas.</p>

              <p>My b’day is coming up real soon, and I want to have a few mates at a ‘spare’ house. (It’s my Uncle’s who has moved to America, yet he still pays for this house). Mum said the usual ‘I’ll think about it,’ so I’m worried that’s a way of holding me off for a no. The house is a 15 min drive away, and has 2 bedrooms. I want to stay there for a Friday and Saturday night, and come back home on the Sunday. This is for my birthday, but I don’t think my mum or dad will let me. Any tips/suggestions/ideas on how to make them change their mind? I’ll be 16 when it happens.</p>
