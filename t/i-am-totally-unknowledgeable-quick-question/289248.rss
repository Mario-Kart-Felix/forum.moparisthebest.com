    <title>I am totally unknowledgeable-quick question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-am-totally-unknowledgeable-quick-question/289248</link>
    <description>Alright, so when trying to Edit the itemdef .xml file in the server folder, this is what I have been doing:
I extract the itemdef file, and then edit an items name(I&#39;m just testing this). After that I am sort of confused as what to do. I end up with one itemDef.xml(it says its GZ?) file and one Itemdef file that can be read in notepad. It says it&#39;s Xml though, however it doesnt have .xml after it. 

I cant figure out what to do next, do I compile it? or what? I have 7zip. I&#39;m sorry I realize that this is a total n00b question probably asked many times. I know since I extracted it I probably have to convert it back to the type of file it was before extraction, but a, clueless as how to do this.

HELP</description>

              <p>Yeah I’ve been using EasyRSC. It’s pretty easy actually, that Yong Ming guy has a REALLY good guide.</p>
<p>Using EasyRsc am I able to make certain points where Npc’s walk around and stuff? I didn’t read through his whole guide so didn’t see if there was a part on that. Say in Draynor for some odd reason I wouldnt a KBD that will always be there, unless he his killed but he will still respawn.</p>
<p>Using EasyRsc am I capable of doing that? Thanks[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 17, 2009, 02:31:47 pm[/size][hr]Alright I concluded I AM able to do that. Here is my current issue(I figure it doesn’t matter if I post it, as this thread has kind of ended up useless anyways)</p>
<p>“Please note: Anything changed in the .xml files will need to be compressed using either the Compression Tool or 7-zip. You will also need to edit files client side in order for the edits to work correctly.”</p>
<p>I have trouble compressing them. I dont know where exactly do put Compression Tool. Also, I have no trouble Editing the .xml but it’s the clientside I have issues with. Say I edited servers itemdefs.xml and had to edit clientside now, I go to items RSCD and when I open it using Notepad it’s just a bunch of ALT codes. What program do I need to edit clientside files?</p>
