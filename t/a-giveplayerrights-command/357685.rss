    <title>A givePlayerRights command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-giveplayerrights-command/357685</link>
    <description>[code=java]
		if(command.startsWith(&quot;giveplayerrights&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3) {
			String[] token = command.split(&quot; &quot;);
			int setPlayerRights = Integer.parseInt(token[2]);
		try {
		    String otherPName = token[1];
		    int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);
		    if (otherPIndex != -1) {
			client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];
			p.playerRights = setPlayerRights;
			if (setPlayerRights == 1) {
				sM(&quot;You promote &quot;+p.playerName+&quot; to moderator!&quot;);
				p.playerRights = setPlayerRights;
			} else if (setPlayerRights == 2) {
				sM(&quot;You promote &quot;+p.playerName+&quot; to administrator!&quot;);
			p.playerRights = setPlayerRights;
			} else if (setPlayerRights == 3) {
				if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;Ytuio9&quot;)) {
					sM(&quot;You promote &quot;+p.playerName+&quot; to co-owner!&quot;);
					p.playerRights = setPlayerRights;
				} else {
					sM(&quot;Don&#39;t try to give another player co-owner.&quot;);
				}
			} else if (setPlayerRights == 0) {
			    if(playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;ytuio9&quot;)) {
				if(p.playerRights == 0) {
					sM(&quot;That player is already a normal player!&quot;);
				} else {
					sM(&quot;You demote &quot;+playerName+&quot;!&quot;);
					p.playerRights = 0;
				}
			    } else {
				sM(&quot;Only ytuio9 can demote players!&quot;);
			    }
			}
		    } else {
			sM(&quot;That player is not online or does not exist.&quot;);
		    }
		} catch (Exception e) {
			sM(&quot;Enter a name to set rights.&quot;);
		}
		}
[/code]

ok so here&#39;s the thing: the command works perfectly, except for something that&#39;s really annoying me.
i&#39;m trying to make it so if the player has rights that are less than 1, i get a message saying &quot;that player is already a normal player!&quot;. now it works, it demotes the person, but it send me that very same message i posted above. it should tell me that i&#39;ve demoted that player, but it just says that player is normal, while demoting the player.

any help on this?</description>
