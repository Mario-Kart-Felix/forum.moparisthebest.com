    <description>i got a huge problem...

i added slayer points, but now, everytime a player re-logs, EVERYTHING resets (except skills and items)

this was the tut i used:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Part One
First you will want to go into your NPCHandler class and search for:
Code:
[quote]public void appendSlayerExperience(int i) {[/quote]
You will see something along the lines of this:
Code:
[quote]c.slayerTask = -1;[/quote]
Below that you will want to add this code:
Code:
[quote]c.slayerPoints += ####;[/quote]
The #### is the amount of points you receive after completing a task.
__________________________________________________ _________________________________________________
Part Two
Now you will want to declare this integer in the Player class:
Code:
[quote]public int slayerPoints;[/quote]
__________________________________________________ _________________________________________________
Part Three
Search for this in the PlayerSave class
Code:
[quote]case 2:[/quote]
And below that you will want to add:
Code:
[quote]} else if (token.equals(&quot;slayerPoints&quot;)) {
						p.slayerPoints = Integer.parseInt(token2);[/quote]
Now search for:
Code:
[quote]/*CHARACTER*/[/quote]
And below it put this:
Code:
[quote]characterfile.newLine();
			characterfile.write(&quot;slayerPoints = &quot;, 0, A);
			characterfile.write(Integer.toString(p.slayerPoints), 0, Integer.toString(p.slayerPoints).length());[/quote]
A - This should be the length from &quot; to the other &quot; in the
Code:
[quote]characterfile.write(&quot;slayerPoints =&quot;, 0, A);[/quote]
In this case, there are 15 chracters(including spaces) between each of the parenthesis. If you copy and paste, and do not change anything, you will NOT have to worry about editing this, so it would look like:
Code:
[quote]characterfile.write(&quot;slayerPoints =&quot;, 0, 15);[/quote]
There you go! Now you have a slayer points system. I will post another tutorial later on how to create a slayer points shop, so please stay tuned!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

need any more info? please ask me</description>
