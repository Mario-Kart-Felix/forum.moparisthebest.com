    <title>Your Rights Online - Freedom of Speech?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-rights-online-freedom-of-speech/470888</link>
    <description>I have a quote here from someone that tried to argue that they couldn&#39;t be infracted because they have &#39;freedom of speech&#39;, and doing so would be unconstitutional. For the safety of that user (because its one of the most uneducated arguments I&#39;ve seen in a while), I will exclude their name from the quote.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Any action taken against my signature would be unconstitutional. Moparscape.org is hosted within the US. Which means the US Law and Constitution apply to this website. 

The US Constitution does not apply to the Internet, it applies to the Internet within the US. You&#39;re a US Citizen, I am a US Citizen, the forum Owner is a US Citizen. All US Laws apply to us and this forum. 

If someone in Britain broke a law that exists here, but not in Britain. The US could have that British citizen shipped oversea to stand trial for his actions. I know you&#39;re smart to realize that the information I am providing you with is valid and stands. So infract me. Would just make you look bad, not me for excersising my rights.

Infracting me for my beliefs is illegal. [snip information that may lead to identification of user]

With that said, it would be AGAINST THE LAW to make an infraction like that.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(I will note that the infraction wasn&#39;t actually about any beliefs, it was for flame)

Now, I will link this:
http://blaisegv.com/community-management/does-free-speech-apply-to-online-communities/

So because this is in the debates section, here&#39;s the debate:

[i]Do you think freedom of speech should apply to all private contexts as well? Should you be able to walk into a store and say whatever you want, even if the store deems it inappropriate? For example, in a toy store, should they be able to kick you out if you start to use a lot of profanity in front of children? Remember, in terms of punishment, it&#39;s only in relation to their premises. As in, they can&#39;t do anything to you besides kick you out from their store (or ban you from the premises). If you start being extremely offensive to people at school, should it be against the law for them to kick you out?[/i]</description>

<p>David, your last quote (in italics) in the OP would be harassment I believe? Harassment is against the law.</p>
<p>This are is a murky area, if you break a policy you can be kicked of the website which is 100% legal. Your not allowed to infringe on rights though, you can make someone leave if they don’t allow you to infringe on their rights if your policy states so but of course if it went to the courts you could get in trouble I believe? You could get them in trouble as they didn’t follow your policy (?) but they could get you in trouble for infringing on their rights (?). This could be all wrong though, its just the way I’ve always thought about it.</p>

Want to know why? Because that’s not longer private property. Your rights to free speech DO NOT APPLY on private property. You are completely missing the point. The store has nothing against you being on their property. They WANT you on their property to buy their goods. But if you violate their policies (ANY policy, including those about what you can/cant say), they can say you are no longer welcome on their property. The same policy applies online. If you make your own message board (or join one that doesn’t care about what you do), you can say whatever you want on it. But Moparisthebest owns this message board, and he made rules for people to follow if they want to stay on this message board.</p>

<p>Damn…<br>
Last I checked the us government doesn’t own moparscape for one, 2, it isn’t illegal because we have our own set of rules, what is against the rules is “illegal” in a way here, it honestly doesn’t have much to do with us laws, even if it was, i doubt the government would put someone on trial for doing their staff job and following the rules of the website by punishing the said victim for flaming, or ship them over here, i doubt they’d care to be honest</p>
