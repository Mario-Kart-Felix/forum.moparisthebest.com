              <p>Yeah, when I started playing there was hardly anyone there.  To most they were just a rumour.  I think the people that knew about the experiments tried to keep it under their hats for as long as possible…</p>
<p>If there’s someone there and you really wanna train, just keep stealing their NPCs and they’ll eventually hop.  I usually go to the same spot and it’s fine.</p>

              <p>If you can afford some Barrow’s items, then go ahead and get 70 Defence.  The best place you can train is at the experiments.  You need to have done a little part of the ‘Creature of Frankenstrain’ quest to enter the area.</p>
