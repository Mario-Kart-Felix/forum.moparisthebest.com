    <description>&quot;Get Programs for Free&quot; thread?  My dad deleted my Photoshop CS2 so now I need to figure out how to get it all over again.  Did it get deleted/old or what?  (Or am I thinking of a completely different site, haven&#39;t been on here since last summer)  Thanks</description>

All Windows users should leave now, if this is how they’re going to talk about open source software.<br>
