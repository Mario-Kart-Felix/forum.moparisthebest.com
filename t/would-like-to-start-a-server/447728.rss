    <title>Would Like to Start a Server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-like-to-start-a-server/447728</link>
    <description>Hi anyone who is reading this. My name is Austin and I just want to discuss a few things so please read through this and reply when it is finished.

[b][u]What I Would Like[/u][/b]

It has always been my goal to have a functioning 24/7 server that I am in charge of. Due to complications with my laptop though after working and working it is not possible. Now as you are reading I&#39;m sure you already know what I am asking for. I would like a partner to help me start a project for a great RSPS. I am an amateur coder which is one reason I am unable to get a server online by myself. I need someone who has a VPS and can host it 24/7. I will do a lot of the advertising for youtube and such. I will make a forum and i already have a No-IP. You would undoubtedly be the main owner and all I would like is to be the Co-Owner. 

[b][u]What My Goal Is[/u][/b]

My goal for the server is to achieve player happiness. I want it to be not only a server that will entertain your time but a place to meet new people and have chats with friends. As the Co-Owner i would do all I can to keep a stable economy and keep a great server going. 

[b][u]The Server Itself[/u][/b]

In my opinion i think it should be either classic 317 or go as new as we can. Because face it, people want the newest and most kick ass things. It would obviously need all the essentials such as godsword specs, claws specs, spirit shields, pvp armour, etc. I think it would be a good idea to make all rares(as listed above) rare drops from monsters. I do not like the idea of being able to buy items with pvp points. A donator shop would be the only place I could understand purchasing these rare items.

So as I said please someone help me out. I think with the right help this could be a great project. I am willing to be dedicated to the server and keep an eye on everything. Thank you for your time.</description>
