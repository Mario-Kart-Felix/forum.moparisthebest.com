    <title>Joint Operations</title>

    <description>Now, I just got the full version of this game yesterday from 1 of my dad&#39;s friends and I started playing it for the latter part of yesterday and some part of today. The game is called Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising and I have to say I really enjoyed it.

The game is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Set in the near future during a war between &quot;Joint Operations&quot; forces, which consist of elite special operations soldiers from the US, UK, Germany, France, Russia, Australia and Indonesia who fight against the Free Aceh Movement-like separatist &quot;Rebels&quot; on the islands of Indonesia.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As it says on Wiki, it is basically focused on the online multiplayer mode but there are a few other modes such as training and that&#39;s about it basically plus there are 4 different game types on the online mode.

So anyone else played this game? How are your experiences?</description>

Ooh, I love Battlefield Vietnam [as the NVA/Vietcong of course ;)], I might try this later.
