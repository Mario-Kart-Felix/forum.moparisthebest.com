              <p>If you have PI:</p>
<blockquote>What it does: If you have NPCS in your PI that don't respawn after you kill them such as Man (Level 1) this is what you do.
<p>Open NPCHandler.java and search:</p>
<p>Code:<br>
public int getRespawnTime(int i) {underneath you will see a lot of cases, these represent the npcs, and the return; at the end is the seconds until it respawns. So if you wish to make a Man - NPC id 1 use Case 1: and if you wish to make him spawn after a minute or so add<br>
return 100; at end like so</p>
<p>Code:<br>
case 1:<br>
return 100;Now save and compile and restart your server.</p>

Adding NPC’s:
<blockquote>Scale of hardness: 1/10
 Knowledge: Need to know how to copy&amp;paste 
Files to open: Autospawn.cgf, and your client you log in on. Npc.cfg
<p>Ok time to start.<br>
----Step one-----<br>
You need to know what the basics of putting a character in a specific area.<br>
So open up your Autospawn.cfg.<br>
Now you will see things like…<br>
//------NpcID—CoordX–CoordY–Height–RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption</p>
<p>So quick explanation NpcID= The character’s ID number.<br>
CoordX= The position that the npc lies on, in the x grid.<br>
Coordy= The position that the npc lies on, in the y part of the grid.<br>
Height= The floor that its on, meaning 0 for regular, 1 upstairs and 2 upstairs.<br>
RangeX1/2=The furthest point you want the NPC to go on the x grid.<br>
RangeY1/2=The furthest point you want the NPC to go on the y grid.<br>
Walktype= This means if you want your character to move or stay still. 1=stationary, 2=walk able<br>
Descriptioin= The character, i suggest you label the town and character name.<br>
—Step two----<br>
Here comes the part where if you have Moparscape, or you can type in ::mypos comes in handy.<br>
Lets start off with a basic character.For example we will use a varrock theif.<br>
Lets put him next to the varrock bank.<br>
—Step three—<br>
Now that your autospawn.cfg is open, go all the way to the bottom. Where you see [ENDOFSPAWNLIST]<br>
Press ENTER just BEFORE it. (you must make sure it is before it otherwise its useless to your server.)<br>
Simply copy this and paste it before it…</p>
<p>spawn = 8 3261 3428 0 0 0 0 0 1 Varrock Thief</p>
<p>----Step four----<br>
Note: you must make sure that you tab and space out the numbers so that they look identical to the ones in your spawn list.<br>
Note: This npc is stationary. he wont move and if you choose to attack him he will attack back. If you decide to use magic on him he will chase you until he is dead.</p>
<p>----Step five—<br>
adding health to the character. Open up your NPC.cfg. From here what you need to do if not dont allready.<br>
You should see a list of names and numbers, at the top you should see the following,<br>
//----NpcID-----NpcName-------------------------combat–health</p>
<p>From here before you do anything check to see if the NPC ID is already in it. If so skip to step six.<br>
Otherwise If the NPCID is not there add it between 7 and 9. It should look like this…</p>
<p>npc = 8 Thief 16 17</p>
<p>From here you need to save all your work!<br>
—step six—<br>
The fun part! Complie and run your server!<br>
Go to east bank in varrock and wahla ! you have your theif right where you put it good job!<br>
