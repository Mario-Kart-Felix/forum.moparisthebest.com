    <description>Hi, I&#39;m running MoparScape perfectly on OS 10.4.8, however, everytime i want to start it up after a reboot, i need to be connected for it to download a file. After downloading it though, i can disconnect the ethernet cable and still play even after opening and exiting. But when I turn off the computer and turn it on, I have to redownload the file. Is there anyway to save the file to my HD, so i don&#39;t have to download it every time? I think it has something to do with the cache files, but i don&#39;t know how to get them or where to put them.

Thanks</description>
