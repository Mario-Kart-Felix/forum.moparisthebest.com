    <title>Psu - atx12v?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/psu-atx12v/385222</link>
    <description>I&#39;m pretty sure I need to buy a new power supply for m computer that I built. Heres what happened. I got a brand new motherboard back from an RMA. I put it in but when it turned on only lights and fans turned on. None of the peripherals turned on and the monitor didn&#39;t either (the light stayed orange). I was talking to some people and they said it was probably my PSU that burnt out. I am using a quad core 3.2 GHz processor and a Saphire ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphics card. They told me I should have atleast had a 750w PSU where I only had a 500w. I went to go order a new PSU and I came across this one: [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182067]http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182067 [/url]. I got confused because for the type of mother board it says : ATX12V v2.2 &amp; EPS12V v2.91. I have an ATX so what is the 12V? Does it matter?</description>
