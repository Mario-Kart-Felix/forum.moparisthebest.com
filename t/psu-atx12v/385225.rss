    <title>Psu - atx12v?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/psu-atx12v/385225</link>
    <description>I&#39;m pretty sure I need to buy a new power supply for m computer that I built. Heres what happened. I got a brand new motherboard back from an RMA. I put it in but when it turned on only lights and fans turned on. None of the peripherals turned on and the monitor didn&#39;t either (the light stayed orange). I was talking to some people and they said it was probably my PSU that burnt out. I am using a quad core 3.2 GHz processor and a Saphire ATI Radeon HD 5770 graphics card. They told me I should have atleast had a 750w PSU where I only had a 500w. I went to go order a new PSU and I came across this one: [url=http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182067]http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182067 [/url]. I got confused because for the type of mother board it says : ATX12V v2.2 &amp; EPS12V v2.91. I have an ATX so what is the 12V? Does it matter?</description>

              <p>well for your current setup (which is very similar to mine) the psu should be fine, i run a 460W, so i think this is a CPU problem.</p>

              <p>It could also be my CPU right? All the lights (on graphics card, power button, ect.) light up. All of the fans turn on. The keyboard lights never go on, the laser for my mouse never goes on, and the light on the USB wireless network thing doesn’t turn on. The monitor light will stay orange, it never goes green or displays anything. I’ve tried 2 other monitors and neither worked. I aon’t think its my motherboard again seeing as how I just got it back from RMA, I’ve RMA’d almost every part of my computer, The RAM, the graphics card, and the motherboard. The only things I haven’t are my PSU, and my CPU (and my optical drive and hard drive if those count). I don’t know what else could be wrong. At first I couldn’t get windows installed or at=ything so I got new RAM because the set I got was faulty. I then coudn’t play games like Minecraft or MOHAA, (sometimes even visual studio 2010 express edition) which are not graphically intensive without blue screens and crashes. So I sent back my graphics card. It didn’t fix the issue so I RMA’d my motherboard, and this is where I am at now. The computer now just doesn’t work. I will try to get a new CPU even though that will run me another $170. But i’m just wondering if it could be my PSU. I probably should mention that I did get thermal paste on some pins, but cleaned it off as best I could, I also bent some but bent them back into place. That thermal paste and bent pins probably didn’t effect it though because I put my PC back together and it didn’t work. Then I took it apart and the bent pins and thermal paste stuff happened. But anyway, what does the ATX12V mean?</p>
