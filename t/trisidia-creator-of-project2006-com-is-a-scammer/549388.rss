              <p>We don’t take action for things done completely off-site unless there is just cause to believe it could negatively affect the forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, getting scammed is extremely common in this community because people are usually not adults and don’t take the proper measures to only use secure transaction methods. That’s why here on MoparScape we don’t allow people to advertise any sort monetary transactions for work or offer rewards for work.</p>
<p>Some tips for you (and anyone reading considering buying from another RSPS member)</p>
<p>[ul][li]You don’t ever pay for work before it’s complete. You create a contract and come to an agreement, which is usually payment AFTER the work is complete. If you’re buying goods (in this case it would be something like a plugin that is already complete), it may be acceptable to pay first, but that’s because you can expect instant delivery and more easily get a refund if they don’t deliver.[/li]<br>
[li]Don’t send money as a gift unless you mean to send it as a gift and expect nothing in return.[/li]<br>
[li]Smart people wont pay you with a gift in case you scam them. Log proof of delivery when selling anything in case you get a dispute.[/li]<br>
[li]Specifically for RSPS, make sure you go through your best effort to get help making something yourself before you spend money on it. 20 dollars for something people spend 5 minutes copying and pasting from someone elses work is just not worth it.[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Sorry you got scammed, but that can happen when you don’t take precautions and give people more credit than they deserve (Trisidia’s current project is just a rehost of another persons base).</p>
