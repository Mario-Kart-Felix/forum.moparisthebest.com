    <title>Help us crash runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-us-crash-runescape/416860</link>
    <description>Ok, soo as you have all heard of pinging a networking with bytes of data over a period of time will affect small networks greatly, but not major networks such as runescape. Unless....
What if everyone on moparscape, or at least a part of moparscape decided to come togather and reminded runescape what makes it great, the players and showed them what a massive amount of ping can do to there already laggy servers. Yes if at least 500 people ping the runescape website at once, im sure its going to have a major effect, just imagine that many packets of data coming into the website at once. It could do damage anywhere in between server and website lagg, to even complete database errors, and server crashes! we can do it moparscape. Please, reply or message me if you wish to take part in a day runescape will remember as the day a bunch of rsps peeps crashed there servers using ping!</description>

              <p>Lol, 500 people can’t crash runescape. It would take a little more, don’t you think?<br>
Anyway, hacking isn’t allowed on these forums. Attacking any website is included in that… So let me wish you luck with your ban. :L</p>
