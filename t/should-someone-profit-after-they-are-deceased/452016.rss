    <title>Should someone profit after they are deceased?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-someone-profit-after-they-are-deceased/452016</link>
    <description>Recently I purchased a book by an author who is deceased. The profits goes to the authors estate which happens to be a do nothing grand daughter.  So spawned the question, should the work of artist and musicians that are deceased generate a profit or become public domain?</description>

Well, to be honest. That author has probably signed a contract that after his death, the profit will go to the person/people he mentioned in the contract. So the author himself has chosen for it.<br>

That is just speculations from your side, and do not address the issue here.[/quote]</p>

              <p>t4: I don’t have enough knowledge about the subject of software licenses. As I see it GPL has its advantages. It protect the freedom of the original source code. It forces people who want to use GPL licensed code to share it on the same terms. BSD is good for the exact opposite reason.</p>
<p>As I see it BSD is preferable for Libraries, as it give developers the possibility of freedom over their own software.<br>
And GPL is better for Software, as it keep the software and any modification free, and doesn’t put any restrictions on modification.</p>
<p>I don’t know why you drag this in here, as there is clear differences between Software and Media (Books, movies etc.).</p>

<p>What?</p>
<p>[quote=“Niall, post:9, topic:452016”]Copyright should belong to the author for 10, 15 or 20 years max, allowing the author to profit from his work and then allow society to profit from the eventual public domain works.</p>
<p>It used to be similar to this of course, now an author will keep the copyright long after any natural lifespan.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree with this.</p>

</aside>
<p>It isn’t a need to profit from the works, but using it for what it is worth. Giving everyone a part of literature without charging them. Make them freely available on the internet, and sell printed versions for those who prefer paper.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t object to profiting from public domain works, as the availability only get higher as you give someone some incentive of distributing it.</p>
<p>The reason for my view here is based on why we have (should have) copyrights. We need something to inspire people to write and make good works. And why should we inspire people to write books and make movies? To entertain or inspire people. Therefore it should be available when the author has gained a some profit from it. It might even inspire more works to be created, as people can’t just lean back after a successful book and get money for something you did 12 years ago.</p>
<p>PS: I’m not speaking of protecting of characters and the world that the book is creating, as that is another subject.</p>

The copyright could be void, and everyone be allowed to distribute the product. And please don’t speak about “the government” as it was an evil beast eating money. Let us say it in a better way, it would be used to give poor people healthcare.</p>
