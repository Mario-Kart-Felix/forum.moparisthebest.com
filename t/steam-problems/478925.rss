    <title>Steam Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/steam-problems/478925</link>
    <description>When I closed my steam to do something else and tried to reopen it it threw errors and would not let my steam open, I even rebooted and the same problem happened... Sooo I uninstalled steam and reinstalled it and it deleted all of my games as well, which took me A LONG TIME to download. WTF? I guess I&#39;ll start using the backup game option that I just now noticed. Anyways feel free to discuss any issues you&#39;ve ever had with steam, this was just a rant topic lol.</description>
