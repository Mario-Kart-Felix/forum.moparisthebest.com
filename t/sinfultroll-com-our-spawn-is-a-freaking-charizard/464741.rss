    <title>SINFULTROLL.COM -- Our spawn is a freaking charizard</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sinfultroll-com-our-spawn-is-a-freaking-charizard/464741</link>
    <description>This server is BADASS. Its not like any other server you played on. EVER.

We&#39;re a mix of...

    Economy
    Anarchy
    PvP
    Survival

We&#39;ve got it all!

Our sever is so BADASS, that we have a freaking CHARIZARD as our spawn.

That&#39;s right people, every single time you die, you get the rare opportunity to plop into the belly of a GIANT FIRE-BREATHING LIZARD. That&#39;s BADASS!


We don&#39;t have many rules... BUT THEY&#39;RE ALL AWESOME!

    Practically be your own admin. This is ANARCHY, leave your crying at home, and deal with whatever the heck happens to you.
    Respect the map. RESPECT IT! This map is freaking beautiful, it was hand crafted and terraformed for weeks before it was released to the public. Keep it that way.
    Troll, don&#39;t grief. Don&#39;t straight up be an a-hole to someone. Atleast grief do it in a funny way, entertaining, non-destructive way.
    BE A BRO. Most important rule right there. Just be a bro.

The website is now up and running too!

The server is growing! We&#39;ve are getting larger, and planning on expanding and opening more slots soon!


PLUGINS WE USE:

    Precious Stones
    Physical Shop
    Simple Clans
    Essentials
    Simple Spleef
    Group Manager</description>
