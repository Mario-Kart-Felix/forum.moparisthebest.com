    <description>Ok so I have been trying for hours, and certainly failing for hours with certain things even though I have set my paths etc and something else has gone wrong.. 

[img]http://gyazo.com/f436b6a06e64bc4dc970f4de256555a5.png[/img]

I have a source I would like to compile and use, and everything else you shall need on my desktop!
I&#39;m just wondering if someone would please just team viewer (download it here http://www.teamviewer.com) me and get this started before you begin abusing me for setting up if I don&#39;t have a clue I do have a clue I think it&#39;s hard to grasp tutorials written out for sources such as 317 and try to get how to use them for 508+ like I said every things here waiting it will probably only take you a couple of minutes to compile it and to give me the owner status that is what I would like and a push forward on how to use a client and a webclient would be amazing.

Just pm if you want to help! 

Thanks</description>
