    <title>[637-639] Weapon Attack Animations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/637-639-weapon-attack-animations/547124</link>
    <description>Hey guys I have gotten some good help on these forums so I am deciding to post this here rather than the &quot;other sites&quot; so yeah..So I am using Dementhium 637-639 and some weapons such as: swords, battleaxes, hatchets, and a few other things are not attacking right. When I attack an NPC with them all I do is punch. I have checked the itemdefeditor.bat and also the equip ids. Does anyone know where else I can try to change the animations at?</description>
