    <title>Coaches Bro Dies?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/coaches-bro-dies/437836</link>
    <description>Well, back in the first day of school, our coach (Bangladeshy), named Coach Shahid, was the most WORST coach I ever met. I seriously wanted to be super mad at him. Then, at March 18[sup]th[/sup], 2012, my coach went, unkown where he was. Everyone in the school wondered and wondered, until March 20[sup]th[/sup], the news came that my coaches older brother had died. He went for 3 days to Houston (where his brother died) and came back. Our P.E. class was on March 24[sup]th[/sup] and when that day came, I didn&#39;t know what to do with him. To be honest, if I talked about his brother, he might be even more sad, but if I don&#39;t talk to him about his brother, then he&#39;ll think I don&#39;t care.

[i]What should I do?[/i]</description>

Well, back in the first day of school, our coach (Bangladeshy), named Coach Shahid, was the most WORST coach I ever met. I seriously wanted to be super mad at him. Then, at March 18[sup]th[/sup], 2012, my coach went, unkown where he was. Everyone in the school wondered and wondered, until March 20[sup]th[/sup], the news came that my coaches older brother had died. He went for 3 days to Houston (where his brother died) and came back. Our P.E. class was on March 24[sup]th[/sup] and when that day came, I didn’t know what to do with him. To be honest, if I talked about his brother, he might be even more sad, but if I don’t talk to him about his brother, then he’ll think I don’t care.</p>
