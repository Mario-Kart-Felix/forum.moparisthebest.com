    <description>[b][size=18pt]The Reason I&#39;m Creating This[/b]

Nostalgia. A yearning for the past. 
 
Reminiscence. The process of recalling those past experiences. The past is only the beginning.
 
I have limited bandwith, so I like to be careful on what caches I download, incase I login to find the server is a 508. Time and time again I would max out on servers and then quit within a day. 
 
Half-assed monsters poking through walls. Coins gained from Clothes stall. What is this?
 
It&#39;s a hunger for money. Don&#39;t you hate being pushed out of a community because you have to pay to use the ::yell command? Or frustrated because you&#39;re limited to a whip, a Fighter torso and Rune platelegs, that everyone else has aswell, because you don&#39;t feel like wasting your money on something as worthless as a private server, when it could go on food for a baby?
 
Project Reminiscence brings to you something new, something fun and something old school - something I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all be yearning for.
 
Don&#39;t expect to login and be the first to 99 Strength in a day, or a Godsword from killing a few Bandos&#39;. No. We believe in rates that let you see every level from 1 to 99, so if you feel like getting 20 attack and stopping, you can.
 
We may not buzz will hundreds of players who are only here for a quick buzz at getting what they can&#39;t in RuneScape, but we maintain and expect, great, genuine and respectful members who take pride in their accounts and relive the great times RuneScape once had, but with a bit of a twist.
 
Thousands upon thousands of items are obtainable here at PR, because everyone likes to look different. Don&#39;t they?
 
Moderator positions are not appliable, so please don&#39;t come here on any intentions of doing so. Just play as you do, be yourself and contribute a little bit. Then, if we are in need of moderators, we will consider possible candidates.
 
The best part about it all, is it&#39;s free. We will never ask for a penny from you to play this game and nothing will be restricted.

[b][size=18pt]Progress[/b]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[19th April 2011]
-Downloaded source &quot;Project Insanity&quot; (original)
-Added new home
-Added altars, relative NPCs, thieving stalls, and banks to home
-Added a Godwars tunnel just outside the home
-Added a Portal (Interdimensional rift) to a never before seen hall of portals
-Re-organised the entire Commands class
-Changed some relative settings to make it more personalised
-Added a random array of all the clothes in the game to the Clothes stall
-Added NPC spawn facing
-Added Yanille, East Ardougne and TzHaar portals at the rift
-Added an NPC spawn command
-Removed the NPC command
-Increased bank space to 500
-PKing arena; Level 49+ &quot;Wilderness&quot; is now completely safe. The outer ring of the Mage Arena is completely safe for spectators, but the Mage Arena itself is now a PKing Arena, stuck at level 10 wilderness for fair and square killing and a 10 second timer for if you or someone else tries to leave whilst in combat to stop safers. It is all one on one
-The free-to-play Wilderness still remains as it was (level 1 - 49)
-Completely re-done Godwars. You must kill Lesser demons for an enchanted key and then use the key on the burnt chest. You then get a random book to use on a corrosponding pedestal at the end of the dungeon to summon 1 of the 4 Godwars bosses.
-Added a new, working gfx method
-Added a Zamorak statue, that if you use a death rune on it, it spawns 18 Death spawn NPCs, a good source of Death runes
-Fixed a bug where it didn&#39;t recognise the equipment slots for certain item arrays
-Fixed NPC dialouge 1, 2 and 3
-Any robes that display glitches in the model or any hats or masks now display correctly on the player, arms, chest, hair, no hair and beard

[20th April 2011]
-You now get a bonus 10k experience for Slayer after every task
-For a starter, you now get a few words of wisdom and a basic wooden sword and shield
-Added a few more interactive NPCs around the Home area, complete with dialouge/drops

[21st April]
-Completed all portals in the Teleportation Rift and added all NPCs complete with drops
-Completely animated all God War bosses (including Zamorak, thanks to Love)
-Ancients can now be cast with any type of staff (except Slayer staff)
-Finally learnt how to use the EventManager as intended (thanks to iDavid2 and Oh-Noes)
-Implemented EventManager timers for doing task, climbing ladders, using items and other things
-Learnt how to use and implemented turnPlayerTo object, npc or anything else before executing the event -- so now your player will turn to what you click, do an animation and then execute the task
-Added a poorly stocked cooking and food supply shop in Yanille, forcing players to fish first before cooking
-Added a poorly stocked smithing shop, but when you have level 60+ Smithing, you have access to a higher stocked and better supplied Smithing shop; this is also in Yanille&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[b]Here&#39;s a minigame I created:[/b]

[b][size=12pt]God Wars[/size][/b]
Welcome to the first official guide for Project Reminiscence. Today, I bring you God Wars. A completely new and original minigame.

[b][color=red]This is a dangerous minigame. You will lose your items upon death (except 3 (unless skulled)) and during the testing of the minigame, we died many times.[/b]

[b][size=12pt]Recommended Levels[/size][/b]
I&#39;d recommend at least 60 attack, strength and defence. The God Wars bosses have real attack, defence and strength bonuses, so your attack and defence will have a profound effect on the outcome of the final battle.

If you would like to get through the minigame with some ease, 80 plus attack, strength and defence should suffice.

Level 70 hitpoints is a must. You could try with 60 hitpoints, but the God Wars bosses hit a maximum of 55 (except Saradomin, who only hits a maximum of 40), and they are known to hit over 50, twice in a row. 60 hitpoints will more than likely result in a KO.

[b][size=12pt]Equipment[/size][/b]

[URL=http://img218.imageshack.us/i/gwd0.png/][IMG]http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/3266/gwd0.png[/img][/URL]

I&#39;d recommend not wearing your Bandos armour that you just got from a previous God Wars trip, as if you die you may lose it. Wear something relatively good, but relatively easy to obtain.

Take a secondary weapon (range or mage) because if you are required to fight Armadyl, you [i]have[/i] to have an attack style other than melee, otherwise you will not be able to attack him. The spec is good on the Dark bow too, for quick damage.

[b][size=12pt]Rewards[/size][/b]
So far, the rewards are just the drops from the God Wars bosses themselves, as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;/*Zamorak Godwars boss*/
112,721 Coins, 182,993 Coins, 220,555 Coins, 316,770 Coins, 566,345 Coins, 1,000,000 Coins, 28 Dragon bones, Zamorak brew(1), Zamorak brew(2), Zamorak brew(3), Zamorak brew(4), Wine of Zamorak, Zamorak robe top, Zamorak robe bottom, Unpowered symbol, Unholy symbol, Zamorak cape, Zamorak staff, Damaged book, Unholy book, Zamorak banner, Hooded cloak, Zamorak mijolnir, Dragon arrows (30), Prayer potion(4) (5), Zamorak bracers, Zamorak d&#39;hide, Zamorak chaps, Zamorak coif, Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3, Zamorak hilt

/*Bandos Godwars boss*/
112,721 Coins, 182,993 Coins, 220,555 Coins, 316,770 Coins, 566,345 Coins, 1,000,000 Coins, 28 Dragon bones, Bandos chestplate, Bandos tassets, Bandos boots, 1,000,000 Coins, Steel bars (50), Mithril bars (40), Adamantite bars (30), Rune bars (20), Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3, Bandos hilt, Logs (150), Oak logs (120), willow logs (100), Yew logs (80), Magic logs (60)

/*Armadyl Godwars boss*/
112,721 Coins, 182,993 Coins, 220,555 Coins, 316,770 Coins, 566,345 Coins, 1,000,000 Coins, 28 Dragon bones, Staff of armadyl, Armadyl pendant, Armadyl helmet, Armadyl chestplate, Armadyl plateskirt, Rune essence (375), Rune essence (450), Rune essence (600), Grimy guam (80), Grimy marrentill (75), Grimy tarromin (70), Grimy harralander (65), Grimy ranarr (60), Grimy irit (55), Grimy avantoe (50), Grimy kwuarm (45), Grimy cadantine (40), Grimy dwarf weed (35), Grimy torstol (30), Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3, Armadyl hilt

/*Saradomin Godwars boss*/
112,721 Coins, 182,993 Coins, 220,555 Coins, 316,770 Coins, 566,345 Coins, 1,000,000 Coins, 28 Dragon bones, Unblessed symbol, Blessed symbol, Saradomin cape, Saradomin staff, Saradomin plate, Saradomin legs, Saradomin full, Saradomin kite, Saradomin skirt, Damaged book, Holy book, Saradomin banner, Hooded cloak, Castlewars hood, Saradomin brew(4), Saradomin brew(3), Saradomin brew(2), Saradomin brew(1), Saradomin mjolnir, Saradomin d&#39;hide, Saradomin chaps, Saradomin coif, Saradomin cloak, Saradomin robe top, Saradomin robe legs, Saradomin sword, Saradomin bracers, Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3, Saradomin hilt&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are plans to add an additional reward system for God Wars boss kills, so keep your eyes peeled.

[b][size=12pt]Starting Off[/b]
As of yet, there is no restriction on entering the God Wars dungeon - but in the future, a kill count will be implemented before being able to enter the Boss gate, to add risk (stops players from running back via getting killed).

Head on over the first rockslide (pile of rocks) directly out of the home area and then over the second. There is a tunnel entrance about half way through, you cannot miss it.

[URL=http://img851.imageshack.us/i/gw1.png/][IMG]http://img851.imageshack.us/img851/2577/gw1.png[/img][/URL]

You will arrive at the bottom next to a ladder. If you speak to Sigbert the adventurer, he will tell you a short story about how he wished he could follow in his father&#39;s footsteps on discovering the resting chamber of the God Lords.

[URL=http://img690.imageshack.us/i/gw2f.png/][IMG]http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9812/gw2f.png[/img][/URL]

Walk into the room with the Lesser demons and the Burnt chest in the middle, and proceed to kill the Lesser demons for a rare drop. It&#39;s not too rare, but has proven to sometimes take quite a while, so it depends on your luck. Eventually you should get an Enchanted key. The Enchanted key is the only drop by Lesser demons, apart from ashes, so I recommend using the clan chat&#39;s Lootshare feature, to help you identify when you get the drop, incase you miss it.

[URL=http://img13.imageshack.us/i/gwd4.png/][IMG]http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/4421/gwd4.png[/img][/URL]

When you&#39;ve obtained the Enchanted key, use it on the Burnt chest for 1 random book out of a possible 4. Each book summons it&#39;s own God Lord. In the following picture, I&#39;ve obtained a beaten book - which means I&#39;ll be fighting Saradomin.

[URL=http://img855.imageshack.us/i/gwd5.png/][IMG]http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/2620/gwd5.png[/img][/URL]

[b][size=12pt]Finishing Off[/b]
Once you&#39;ve obtained a book, navigate your way east through the dungeon maze until you come across a chamber with 8 pedestals residing inside.

Walk through the gate.

[URL=http://img853.imageshack.us/i/gwd6.png/][IMG]http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/3766/gwd6.png[/img][/URL]

Use the book on a pedestal. If it is the incorrect book used on the pedestal, then a message will notify you which book you need to summon the corrosponding God Lord. If it&#39;s the correct book, you will summon a God Lord and they will appear in the middle of the 8 pedestals and proceed to attack you. Only you can attack your summoned God Lord.

[URL=http://img801.imageshack.us/i/gwd65.png/][IMG]http://img801.imageshack.us/img801/290/gwd65.png[/img][/URL]

Use the relevant protective prayer, otherwise you will get hit a lot harder than if you was praying. Apart from Zamorak, every other God Lord has an alternative attack that they will use. So you will always get hit damage. So choose your protective prayer wisely.

              <p>[quote=“ITI Basak ITI, post:38, topic:392370”]I am unsure as to why this is happening. I have had many friends, Mendorphins, and Loveandpower try to help but nothing seems to ever work. I have set up a static ip just as a portforwarding tutorial instructed, I set up my router to portforward correctly. Everything seems to work out great. I download the pfportchecker, and even that says 43594 tcp and udp ports are open on my computer. But then I open up no-ip and use the canyouseeme port checker and it continues to tell me connection has timed out. I dont understand how 2 portcheckers can say 2 different things. I uppit a client to my friend to see if we can get him connected and nothing ever works. Im sure it has something to do with my porting. If anyone knowa the Windows 7 OS and would like to T.V. with me to help figure this mess out, it would be greatly appreciated <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> thanks</p>
<p>P.s. Your prolly wondering why I posted this so Ill explain. I posted this in server help no one could help with a damn thing. This is for this server and for mendorphins and I was hoping maybe some of you who may be quite experienced could help us out. He wants me to host his server as I have become quite a close friend to him during the creation of this server. We would both really appreciate it if you could help me solve my computers pain in the ass issues ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>It may be because the local program “thinks” that all ports are open. Although I’m not sure how it operates.</p>

I download the pfportchecker, and even that says 43594 tcp and udp ports are open on my computer. But then I open up no-ip and use the canyouseeme port checker and it continues to tell me connection has timed out. I dont understand how 2 portcheckers can say 2 different things. I uppit a client to my friend to see if we can get him connected and nothing ever works. Im sure it has something to do with my porting. If anyone knowa the Windows 7 OS and would like to T.V. with me to help figure this mess out, it would be greatly appreciated <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> thanks</p>
<p>P.s. Your prolly wondering why I posted this so Ill explain. I posted this in server help no one could help with a damn thing. This is for this server and for mendorphins and I was hoping maybe some of you who may be quite experienced could help us out. He wants me to host his server as I have become quite a close friend to him during the creation of this server. We would both really appreciate it if you could help me solve my computers pain in the ass issues <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>One thing I implemented in my server was just s hashed password. Server generates a random X-bit seed, then hashes the password with that seed, and stores the hashed pass and seed in the file. So if anyone somehow got access to the character files, they wouldn’t be able to get the passwords.</p>
