    <title>[Req]CShell</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/req-cshell/18826</link>
    <description>I read through the Ubuntu &#39;man&#39; in terminal, and it had loads of references to the CShell. It went on about CSh, CC, CCompiler, etc. The odd thing is that for some reason it wasn&#39;t found on my Ubuntu. I&#39;m thinking this might be an error during installation? Anyways, if someone could please provide me with one, I would be intensely grateful. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Yeah, it is a C shell. I read about the Bourne-Again Shell too, and it said it implements features from KornShell and CShell. The problem is that I’m trying to install wxWidget so that I could get an SVN App going, and I couldn’t get it to work. When I talked to my mom’s friend about it, he said I’ll need to use CShell to do this. We looked around for it for about an hour and couldn’t find it. = \</p>

              <p>Dont trust me on this, but I think it is a type of Shell that uses C style scripting, BASh can probably do this too</p>
