    <title>Can&#39;t login? Any Ideas?</title>

    <description>Hey sorry to bother everyone but im having trouble with my 525 server. It is CodeUsa and i can&#39;t get the client to load on my ip. If i set it to 127.0.0.1 it works fine but as soon as i set it to mine is Class68_sub20_sub15 it get the error error_game_js5connect. I have opened up the port through my router and set it to port 43594. I have went through all the stuff in no-ip this isn&#39;t my first server. But for some reason no matter what i do on a 525 i can&#39;t seem to get any of them to load. I always get the same error. I have followed a few tutorials and none work. Can anyone think of a quick reason why it isn&#39;t working? It is pretty frustrating because i have spent a lot of time on this server and the fact that i can&#39;t change my ip is pretty stupid.Thanks for your time=) :)
