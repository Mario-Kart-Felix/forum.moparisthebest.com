    <description>creds to me. took ages to put this together, enjoy :D

This is a short introduction to writing HTML. What is HTML? It is a special kind of text document that is used by Web browsers to present text and graphics. The text includes markup tags such as &lt;p&gt; to indicate the start of a paragraph, and &lt;/p&gt; to indicate the end of a paragraph. HTML documents are often refered to as &quot;Web pages&quot;. The browser retrieves Web pages from Web servers that thanks to the Internet, can be pretty much anywhere in World.

Many people still write HTML by hand using tools such as NotePad on Windows, or TextEdit on the Mac. This guide will get you up and running. Even if you don&#39;t intend to edit HTML directly and instead plan to use an HTML editor such as Netscape Composer, or W3C&#39;s Amaya, this guide will enable you to understand enough to make better use of such tools and how to make your HTML documents accessible on a wide range of browsers. Once you are comfortable with the basics of authoring HTML, you may want to learn how to add a touch of style using CSS, and to go on to try out features covered in my page on advanced HTML

p.s. a good way to learn is to look at how other people have coded their html pages. To do this, click on the &quot;View&quot; menu and then on &quot;Source&quot;. On some browsers, you instead need to click on the &quot;File&quot; menu and then on &quot;View Source&quot;. Try it with this page to see how I have applied the ideas I explain below. You will find yourself developing a critical eye as many pages look rather a mess under the hood</description>

<p>If you’re going to steal something from anywhere and want to get away with it, then don’t steal it from the organisation which set the web standards for us all. It is likely, especially people from this site, use <a href="http://w3.org" rel="nofollow noopener">w3.org</a> regularly.</p>
