    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-rocks/3009</link>
    <description>Okay, it may sound quite weird, but i think this is good for the cheating community. I have never really liked aryan, i have only made a few 100k&#39;s on it, but that was all. Now Aryan is dead the cheating community will be *more* active again, and all the noobs will be gone (No, i don&#39;t hate noobs, as long they don&#39;t post &quot;wtf aryan doesn&#39;t work! Someone update, NOW!&quot;) we can -finally- get back to SCAR (Kaitnieks can be happy too :P)

Don&#39;t you agree? Aryan was fun, for a while. It spoiled the game in many ways. I don&#39;t like RuneScape (i was totally addicted to it, until i found kaitnieks) anymore, and i&#39;m quite sure you too. For my part, Aryan may remain dead and moparscape has to work (Ofcourse we cheaters need an unfair advantage, dÃ»h) again. Deal?

And, if you really want to hack a game, go play Adventure Quest :D ;)

God, now i remember how fun SCAR was :)</description>

              <p>lol, you people.  Scar is the ONLY way to cheat.  THe SRL dev team worked their tails off and brought the easiest to use include EVER MADE!  (sry squig, SRL owns).  With the scripts now, i dont even worry about being banned!  The reason Aryan was decetable because it went into the java, couple of special packets from jagex, and boom, ur spotter.  Scar is human level.  its like so awesome!  its not even comparabol to aryan!</p>

<p>Yes, I did auto with aryan, yes I did make a profit with aryan, yes it was faster than scar. BUT, with SCAR, the scripts are more stable and you have ALOT LESS chance of getting banned.</p>

              <p>Okay, it may sound quite weird, but i think this is good for the cheating community. I have never really liked aryan, i have only made a few 100k’s on it, but that was all. Now Aryan is dead the cheating community will be <em>more</em> active again, and all the noobs will be gone (No, i don’t hate noobs, as long they don’t post “wtf aryan doesn’t work! Someone update, NOW!”) we can -finally- get back to SCAR (Kaitnieks can be happy too :P)</p>
<p>Don’t you agree? Aryan was fun, for a while. It spoiled the game in many ways. I don’t like RuneScape (i was totally addicted to it, until i found kaitnieks) anymore, and i’m quite sure you too. For my part, Aryan may remain dead and moparscape has to work (Ofcourse we cheaters need an unfair advantage, dÃ»h) again. Deal?</p>
<p>And, if you really want to hack a game, go play Adventure Quest <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
