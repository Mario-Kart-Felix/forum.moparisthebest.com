    <title>[Delta] Problem Special Attack D claw on Players</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-problem-special-attack-d-claw-on-players/385781</link>
    <description>Hi, Ive got this little problem with Dragon Claws in DeltaScape Scource.
I know this is pretty basics but I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s rong.

So when i special attack with the dragon claws on a player, it disconnects the player who specialed with the claws.
On monsters this does NOT happen.

Here is my Client.java dragon claw added files :
[code]
public int DCdown = 0;[/code]

and

[code]if(id == 8002) // claw
{
return 2068;
}[/code]

and

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 8002)
{
return 2068;
}[/code]

and

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 8002 &amp;&amp; specialAmount &gt; 49){
specialAtk(true, 50, 252, 2068);
DCdown = 4;
DCDamg = true;
getHit(8);
usingSpecial = true;
}[/code]

and

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == 8002 &amp;&amp; specialAmount &gt; 49){
specialAtkNPC(true, 50, 282, 2068);
DCdown = 4;
DCDamg = true;
npcDamage(8);
}
[/code]

Here is the things ive been added in special.java
[code]                case 8002:[/code]


and
[code]
                case 8002:[/code]

Ive really no idea what I did rong, maybe its in the client but idk... 
Please help me.
