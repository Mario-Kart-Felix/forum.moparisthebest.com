<p>the minimap variables are named fine.</p>
<p>getCompassAngle,<br>

<p>we are talking about the <span class="bbcode-b">cameraCurve X / Y</span> or what can be called <span class="bbcode-b">cameraAngle X / Y</span>.<br>
but yes, as i have previously stated, pitch and yaw are fine.</p>
<p>but really tbh, why does it matter if someones names differ, i could use zyxx as a method name and it not bother me,<br>
yes it would make more sence to name it something uniform and maybe abstract. but for personal bots, aslong as you understand it, it is fine.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Angle:</p>
<blockquote>In geometry and trigonometry, an angle (in full, plane angle) is the figure formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. The magnitude of the angle is the "amount of rotation" that separates the two rays, and can be measured by considering the length of circular arc swept out when one ray is rotated about the vertex to coincide with the other (see "Measuring angles", below). Where there is no possibility of confusion, the term "angle" is used interchangeably for both the geometric configuration itself and for its angular magnitude (which is simply a numerical quantity).</blockquote>
<p>Curve:</p>
<blockquote>In mathematics, the concept of a curve tries to capture the intuitive idea of a geometrical one-dimensional and continuous object. A simple example is the circle. In everyday use of the term "curve", a straight line is not curved, but in mathematical parlance curves include straight lines and line segments. A large number of other curves have been studied in geometry.</blockquote>

<p>Think before you write! They aren’t array’s, so they can’t be the precalculated sine/cosine array’s can they?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">            X -= Bot.getClient().getCamPosX();

<p>array =], therefore frank_ is actually right.[/quote]<br>
Thought of that first, but since no one posted an output with <span class="bbcode-b">curveArray’s</span>. I didn’t completly understand his sentence.</p>
<p>Could some one explain difference between an angle and a curve, cause I’m used to Dutch math, so I don’t understand the namings.</p>
<p>Edit: I only looked at his first log, not his second. I’m sorry for my mistake.<br>
I just noticed I hooked it myself aswell, but I don’t use it. I think it’s the sin/curve array, but as I hook the wrong things (same as speedster), I can’t be to sure.</p>

<p>the naming is terrible, primarily because they are not curves, they are angles. surely you guys do know the difference?</p>

I find it funny that you don’t know a shit about the internal architecture of the client. If you take a good old aryan deob, you can find nearly every method in it.<br>
The highest changes are the methodCounter, more static methods, their own string class, better obfuscation. They rebuild the way interfaces work.<br>
Also you can update Aryan to this new engine without much trouble, as long as you rebuild some structures and you don’t invoke methods directly.<br>
(Unless you want to keep track of the counters). Although this would get you banned, it would be the same as it was at the old engine.</p>
<p>(This is speaking of the client 490! So if it changed drasticly after that, then I’m wrong XD)</p>

<p>speedster239, you know what they are, change their names<br>
also, get rid of cameraCurveX/Y, where is the curve anyway? call them cameraPitch and cameraYaw</p>
<p>also, don’t use reflection to set fields, use bytecode and make a setter method,<br>
its like making a getter method, only not,<br>
okay play with reflection with fields for a bit, but my advice is move away from it as quickly as possible</p>

<pre><code>Client.getSkillExperiences() -&gt; gets static field "df.int[] m"
Client.getSkillExperiencesMax() -&gt; gets static field "th.int[] d"
Client.getSkillLevels() -&gt; gets static field "mi.int[] Kb"
Client.getSkillLevelsMax() -&gt; gets static field "mb.int[] nb"
</code></pre>
