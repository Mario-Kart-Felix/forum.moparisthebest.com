<blockquote>An essay on tits
<p>While many learned professors have abandoned hope of ever discovering the truth behind tits, I for one feel that it is still a worthy cause for examination. Advancments in tits can be linked to many areas. Though tits is a favourite topic of discussion amongst monarchs, presidents and dictators, several of todays most brilliant minds seem incapable of recognising its increasing relevance to understanding future generations. It is estimated that that tits is thought about eight times every day by the easily lead, who are likely to form a major stronghold in the inevitable battle for hearts and minds. Though I would rather be in bed I will now examine the primary causes of tits.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>While some scholars have claimed that there is no such thing as society, this is rubbish. When J H Darcy said ‘fevour will spread’ [1] she must have been referning to tits. A society without tits is like a society without knowledge, in that it demonstrates a coherent approach, something so lacking in our culture, that it is not recognised by all.</p>
<p>Primarily tits builds trust among the people. It is intrinsically linked to adolescent inner acclimatisation.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>The dictionary defines economics as ‘the social science concerned with the production, distribution, exchange, and consumption of goods and services’. We will primarily be focusing on the Maiden-Tuesday-Lending model, a classic economic system of analysis.<br>
Oil<br>
Prices</p>
<pre><code>	tits
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly the graphs demonstrates a strong correlation. Why is this? Clearly oil prices, ultimately decided by politicians, will always be heavily influenced by tits due to its consistently high profile in the portfolio of investors. Supply Side Economic Tax Cuts Tax deductions could turn out to be a risky tactic.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Politics was once a game featuring competitors from elite classes. Placing theory on the scales of justice and weighing it against practice can produce similar results to contrasting tits and ones own image of themselves.</p>
<p>One quote comes instantly to mind when examining this topic. I mean of course the words of a legend in their own life time, Xaviera Lionel Forbes Dickinson ‘Man’s greatest enemy is complacency with regards to personal and political hygiene.’ [2] One cannot help but agree when faced with tits, that this highlights an important issue. It would be wise to approach the subject with the thought that ‘if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all’. However this can lead to missing out important facts.<br>
One thing’s certain. The Human species liberally desires tits, and what’s more human than politics?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To reiterate, tits deserves all of the attention it gets. It brings peace, puts out ‘fires’, and is a joy to behold.</p>
<p>As a parting shot here are the words of super-star Elton Malkovitch: ‘It’s been nice educating you.’ [3]</p>

              <p>I shall now enrich your life by sharing with you about Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours. There are many factors which influenced the development of Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours. Remarkably Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours is heralded by shopkeepers and investment bankers alike, leading many to state that it is yet to receive proper recognition for laying the foundations of democracy. It still has the power to shock those most reliant on technology, whom I can say no more about due to legal restrictions. Complex though it is I shall now attempt to provide an exaustive report on Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours and its numerous ‘industries’.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society is a simple word with a very complex definition. Back when Vealinger reamarked �the power struggle will continue while the great tale of humanity remains untold� [1] he borrowed much from Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours. While the western world use a knife and fork, the Chinese use chopsticks. Of course Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours is crunchy on the outside but soft in the middle.</p>
<p>Some analysts have been tempted to disregard Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours. I haven�t. If society has a favourite child, it is Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of discussion in the world of economics, centred on the value of Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours. We shall examine the Spanish-Armada model of economics. Interest</p>
<p>Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours</p>
<p>The statistics make it clear that Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours is a major market factor. Even a child could work out that interest cannot sustain this instability for long. A sharp down turn in middle class investment may lead to changes in the market.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Politics - smolitics! Comparing international relations since the end of the century can be like observing night and day.</p>
<p>In the words of the famous political Noah Bootlegger ‘I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in democracy.’ [2] I argue that his insight into Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours provided the inspiration for these great words. To paraphrase, the quote is saying ‘Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours wins votes.’ Simple as that.</p>
<p>While Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours may be a giant amongst men, is it a dwarf amongst policy? I hope not.<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>In my opinion Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours is, to use the language of the streets ‘Super Cool.’ It questions, invades where necessary and statistically it’s great.</p>
<p>Let’s finish with a thought from star Nicole Pfeiffer: ‘Oooh yeah Ya Mum Has A Penis Bigger than yours shoo badaby dooo.’ [3]</p>
<p>hmmm f----------------</p>

              <blockquote>In this essay I will consider the social, economic and political factors of your mama. The constantly changing fashionable take on your mama demonstrates the depth of the subject. Given that its influence pervades our society, there are just not enough blues songs written about your mama. Often it is seen as both a help and a hinderence to those most reliant on technology, obviously. Keeping all of this in mind, in this essay I will examine the major issues. 
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society is a simple word with a very complex definition. The immortal and indispensable phrase �honesty is the best policy� [1] failed to understand that if one seriously intends to ‘not judge a book by its cover’, then one must read a lot of books. Both tyranny and democracy are tried and questioned. Yet your mama smells of success.</p>
<p>Our post-literate society, more than ever before, relies upon your mama. Just as a dog will return to its own sick, society will return to your mama, again and again.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of discussion in the world of economics, centred on the value of your mama. We will primarily be focusing on the Maiden-Tuesday-Lending model, which I hope will be familiar to most readers. Oil<br>
Prices</p>
<p>your mama</p>
<p>What a splendid graph. Recent studies indicate that oil prices plays in increasingly important role in the market economy. What it all comes down to is money. Capitalists love your mama.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Politics - smolitics! Politicians find it difficult to choose between what has become known in politics as - ‘The two ways’ - playing with a puppy and singing with a blackbird.</p>
<p>To quote the star of stage and screen Odysseus Shandy ‘You can lead a horse to water, big deal.’ [2] Considered by many to be one of the ‘Founding Fathers’ of your mama, his words cannot be over-looked. If I may be as bold as to paraphrase, he was saying that ‘political ideals are built on the solid cornerstone of your mama.’</p>
<p>Is your mama politically correct, in every sense? Each man, woman and to a lesser extent, child, must make up their own mind.<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion, your mama plays a large part in the lives of all. It collaborates successfully, puts out ‘fires’, and never hides.</p>
<p>The final say goes to the award winning Wyclef Beckham: ‘It’s been nice educating you.’ [3]</p>

              <p>An essay on Mopar<br>
‘Brilliant’, ‘Quite Good’, ‘What?’, these are just some of the comments made recently in the press regarding Mopar. At first glance Mopar may seem unenchanting, however its study is a necessity for any one wishing to intellectually advance beyond their childhood. Remarkably Mopar is heralded by shopkeepers and investment bankers alike, leading many to state that there are just not enough blues songs written about Mopar. Often it is seen as both a help and a hinderence to socialists, trapped by their infamous history. Complex though it is I shall now attempt to provide an exaustive report on Mopar and its numerous ‘industries’.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Interweaving social trends form a strong net in which we are all trapped. When Sir Bernard Chivilary said ‘hounds will feast on society’ [1] he was clearly refering to the impact of Mopar on today’s society. While the western world use a knife and fork, the Chinese use chopsticks. Of course Mopar cleary plays a significant role amongst the developing middle classes.</p>
<p>Primarily Mopar builds trust among the people. If society has a favourite child, it is Mopar.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Our world is driven by supply and demand. We shall examine the Inter-Spam model, a complex but ultimately rewarding system. Interest</p>
<p><img src="http://radioworldwide.gospelcom.net/essaygenerator/images/graph_up_2.gif" alt width="" height=""><br>
Mopar</p>
<p>What a splendid graph. Even a child could work out that interest, ultimately decided by politicians, will always be heavily influenced by Mopar due to its consistently high profile in the portfolio of investors. Supply Side Economic Tax Cuts Tax deductions could turn out to be a risky tactic.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Machiavellian politics is rife. Are our leaders justified in pursuing and maintaining political power? Comparing the electoral politics of most Western and Eastern European countries is like comparing Moparism and post-Moparism.</p>
<p>Let us consider the words of that silver tongued orator, a legend in their own life time, Bonaventure Lionel Forbes Dickinson ‘The success of any political system can only truly be assessed once the fat lady has sung.’ [2] This clearly illustrates the primary concern of those involved with Mopar. If our political system can be seen as a cake, then Mopar makes a good case for being the icing.</p>
<p>I hope, for our sake that Mopar will endure.<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>In my opinion Mopar may not be the best thing since sliced bread, but it’s still important. It brings peace, brought up a generation and always chips in.</p>
<p>One final thought from the talented Demi Kournikova: ‘I wouldn’t be where I am today without Mopar.’ [3]</p>

              <p>Damn, you guys are funny!<br>
here’s mine: (I cut out a couple lines about an STD fasion line…not funny)</p>
<blockquote>An essay on STDs
I shall now enrich your life by sharing with you about STDs. In depth analysis of STDs can be an enriching experience. [b]Though STDs is a favourite topic of discussion amongst monarchs, presidents and dictators, there are just not enough blues songs written about STDs.[/b] Crossing many cultural barriers it still draws remarks such as 'I wouldn't touch it with a barge pole' and 'i'd rather eat wasps' from the over 50, who just don't like that sort of thing. In the light of this I will break down the issues in order to give each of them the thought that they fully deserve 
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Interweaving social trends form a strong net in which we are all trapped. When Thucictholous said ‘people only know one thing’ [1] he borrowed much from STDs. <span class="bbcode-b">A childs approach to STDs provides standards by which we may judge our selves.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Our post-literate society, more than ever before, relies upon STDs. Just as a dog will return to its own sick, society will return to STDs, again and again.</span></p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of discussion in the world of economics, centred on the value of STDs.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons which may be attributed to this unquestionable correlation. Well the market value of gold is in financial terms <span class="bbcode-b">‘holding hands with STDs.’</span> Supply Side Economic Tax Cuts Tax deductions <span class="bbcode-b">could turn out to be a risky tactic.</span></p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Machiavellian politics is rife. Are our leaders justified in pursuing and maintaining political power? Politicians find it difficult to choose between what has become known in politics as - <span class="bbcode-b">‘The two ways’ - STDs and political feeling</span>.</p>
<p>Let us consider the words of that silver tongued orator, a legend in their own life time, Aaron T. Time ‘I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in STDs.’ [2] This quotation leads me to suspect that he was not unaccustomed to STDs. It speaks volumes. History tells us that STDs will always be a vote winner, whether we like it, or not.</p>
<p>One thing’s certain. <span class="bbcode-b">The Human species liberally desires STDs</span>, and what’s more human than politics?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">In my opinion STDs has a special place in the heart of mankind. It questions, ‘literally’ plants seeds for harvest, and figures show it’s a winning formular.</span></p>
<p>I shall give the final word to star Elton Astaire: ‘Oooh yeah STDs shoo badaby dooo.’ [3]</p>

<p>Shooting people:</p>
<p>An essay on Shooting people<br>
Man’s greatest achievement? Perhaps not, but can you afford not to read on when I am about to tell you about Shooting people? Underestimate Shooting people at your peril. While it has been acknowledged that it has an important part to play in the development of man, there are just not enough blues songs written about Shooting people. It still has the power to shock global commercial enterprises, who form the last great hope for our civilzation. Though I would rather be in bed I will now examine the primary causes of Shooting people</p>
<p>Primarily Shooting people builds trust among the people. It has been said that the one thing in society which could survive a nuclear attack is Shooting people. This is incorrect, actually cockroaches are the only thing which can survive a nuclear attack.</p>

<blockquote>An essay on humping
While many learned professors have abandoned hope of ever discovering the truth behind humping, I for one feel that it is still a worthy cause for examination. I really, really like humping. While it is becoming a hot topic for debate, humping is featuring more and more in the ideals of the young and upwardly mobile. Inevitably humping is often misunderstood by the upper echelons of progressive service sector organisations, who form the last great hope for our civilzation. Keeping all of this in mind, in this essay I will examine the major issues. 
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society is a simple word with a very complex definition. When Thucictholous said ‘people only know one thing’ [1] he created a monster which society has been attempting to tame ever since. A society without humping is like a society without knowledge, in that it smells of success.</p>
<p>Status, Security, Fame - humping, all revolve around this ‘golden fleece’. Just as a dog will return to its own sick, society will return to humping, again and again.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Economics has been defined as ‘I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine.’ To my learned ear that sounds like two people with itchy backs. We will study the JTB-Guide-Dog model. Taking special care to highlight the role of humping within the vast framework which this provides. Average<br>
Wage</p>
<p>humping</p>
<p>The results displayed in the graph are too clear to be ignored. My personal view is that the average wage sings a very different tune. The financial press seems unable to make up its mind on these issues which unsettles investors.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Posturing as concerned patriarchs, many politicians guide the electorate herd to the inevitable cattle shed of ‘equal opportunity.’ Placing theory on the scales of justice and weighing it against practice can produce similar results to contrasting chalk and cheese.</p>
<p>In the words of that most brilliant mind Maximilian Woodpecker ‘I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in democracy.’ [2] He was first introduced to humping by his mother. It is a well known ‘secret’ that what prompted many politicians to first strive for power was humping.</p>
<p>Since the Renaissance humping has become more and more prevalent. May it continue.<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>To conclude humping has, and will continue to be a major building block for the world in which we live. It sings a new song, applauds greatness and is always fashionably late.</p>
<p>Let’s finish with a thought from star Whoopi Clooney: ‘humping is the new rock and roll! And the new opera!’</p>

              <blockquote>An essay on cow sex
<p>Let us commence a journey into the much travelled topic of cow sex. At first glance cow sex may seem unenchanting, however its study is a necessity for any one wishing to intellectually advance beyond their childhood. Remarkably cow sex is heralded by shopkeepers and investment bankers alike, leading many to state that several of todays most brilliant minds seem incapable of recognising its increasing relevance to understanding future generations. Since it was first compared to antidisestablishmentarianism much has been said concerning cow sex by those most reliant on technology, who are likely to form a major stronghold in the inevitable battle for hearts and minds. Complex though it is I shall now attempt to provide an exaustive report on cow sex and its numerous ‘industries’.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Comparisons between Roman Society and Medieval Society give a clear picture of the importance of cow sex to developments in social conduct. I will not insult the readers inteligence by explaining this obvious comparison any further. The immortal and indispensable phrase �honesty is the best policy� [1], contrary to my learned colleague Sir George Allen�s recent publication �Into the eye of , could not have been referring to eighteenth century beliefs regarding society. No symbol is more potent than cow sex in society today. It is crunchy on the outside but soft in the middle.</p>
<p>Did I mention how lovely cow sex is? Just as a dog will return to its own sick, society will return to cow sex, again and again.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>The preceding section may have shed some light on society but to really understand man you must know how he spends his money. We shall examine the Inter-Spam model using the median instead of the mean, where possible.<br>
Oil<br>
Prices</p>
<pre><code>	cow sex
</code></pre>
<p>The statistics make it clear that cow sex is a major market factor. Well oil prices sings a very different tune. The financial press seems unable to make up its mind on these issues which unsettles investors.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Modern politics owes much to the animal kingdom. Comparing the electoral politics of most Western and Eastern European countries is like comparing the vote of the man in the street with that of one more accustomed to cow sex.</p>
<p>One quote comes instantly to mind when examining this topic. I mean of course the words of nobel prize winner Maximilian Bootlegger ‘You can lead a horse to water, big deal.’ [2] This quotation leads me to suspect that he was not unaccustomed to cow sex. It speaks volumes. Perhaps the word which sums up the importance of cow sex to politics is ‘participation’.<br>
One of the great ironies of this age is cow sex. Isn’t it ironic, don’t you think?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We can say with certainty cow sex has played a large part in the development of man in the 20th Century and its influence remains strong. It enlightens our daily lives, provides financial security, though cow sex brings with it obvious difficulties, it is truly cow sex.</p>
<p>The final say goes to the award winning Keanu Poppins: ‘Oooh yeah cow sex shoo badaby dooo.’ [3]</p>

              <p>An essay on porn<br>
In order to understand our selves, we must first understand porn. Advancments in porn can be linked to many areas. Until recently considered taboo amongst polite society, it is impossible to overestimate its impact on modern thought. It still has the power to shock the easily lead, who just don’t like that sort of thing. At the heart of the subject are a number of key factors. I plan to examine each of these factors in detail and and asses their importance.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>There is cultural and institutional interdependence between members of any community. When Thucictholous said ‘people only know one thing’ [1] he must have been referning to porn. No symbol is more potent than porn in society today. It raises the question ‘why?’</p>
<p>Our post-literate society, more than ever before, relies upon porn. It is intrinsically linked to adolescent inner acclimatisation.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Do we critique the markets, or do they in-fact critique us? We will primarily be focusing on the Inter-Spam model, which I hope will be familiar to most readers. Cost<br>
Of<br>
Living</p>
<p>porn</p>
<p>The statistics make it clear that porn is a major market factor. Well the cost of living will continue to follow porn for the foreseeable future. Perhaps to coin a phrase porneconomics will be the buzz word of the century</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Much of the writings of historians display the conquests of the most powerful nations over less powerful ones. Comparing the electoral politics of most Western and Eastern European countries is like comparing porn and ones own image of themselves.</p>
<p>In the words of that most brilliant mind Demetrius H. Amster ‘Political idealists must ideally deal, for I daily list my ideals politically.’ [2] This quotation leads me to suspect that he was not unaccustomed to porn. It speaks volumes. Both spectacular failure and unequaled political accomplishment may be accredited to porn.</p>
<p>The question which we must each ask ourselves is, will we allow porn to win our vote?<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>What can we conclude? Well, porn has a special place in the heart of mankind. It collaborates successfully, it stimulates and figures show it’s a winning formular.</p>
<p>One final thought from the talented Stevie Pfeiffer: ‘My Daddy loved porn and his Daddy loved porn.’ [3]</p>
