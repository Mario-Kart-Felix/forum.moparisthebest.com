<p>[code]An essay on penis<br>
The subject of penis has been covered intensively by the world press over the past decade. Advancments in penis can be linked to many areas. Remarkably penis is heralded by shopkeepers and investment bankers alike, leading many to state that there are just not enough blues songs written about penis. It still has the power to shock the over 50, whom I can say no more about due to legal restrictions. Here begins my indepth analysis of the glourious subject of penis.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>There is cultural and institutional interdependence between members of any community. Upon Peter Pinkleton-PishPosh’s return to Britain he remarked ‘class will refelect the inner hero’ [1], he was clearly refering to the impact of penis on today’s society. While the western world use a knife and fork, the Chinese use chopsticks. Of course penis cleary plays a significant role amongst the developing middle classes.</p>
<p>Primarily penis builds trust among the people. Society says that every man must find their own truth. While one sees penis, another may see monkeys playing tennis.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Economics has been defined as ‘I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine.’ To my learned ear that sounds like two people with itchy backs. We shall examine the Greek-Roman model, which I hope will be familiar to most readers. Interest</p>
<p>penis</p>
<p>The statistics make it clear that penis is a major market factor. It goes with out saying that interest world wide are driven entirely by penis. Strong fluctuations in investor confidence have been seen over the past two financial years.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Politics has in some areas been seen to embrace an increasing ananiathesis of intergovernmentalism leading to neo-functionalism. Politicians find it difficult to choose between what has become known in politics as - ‘The two ways’ - penis now, and its equivalent in the 1800s.</p>
<p>To quote jazz singer Achilles Tuigamala ‘consciousness complicates a myriad of progressions.’ [2] Amazingly, he new nothing of penis until he was well into his thirties. I feel strongly that if politicians spent less time thinking about penis and put more effort into their family life, that we would have a very different country.</p>
<p>Why did penis cross the road? - To get to the other side! Just my little joke, but lets hope that penis doesn’t inspire similar hilarity in the next elections.<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>In summary, penis is, to use the language of the streets ‘Super Cool.’ It questions, it stimulates and always chips in.</p>
<p>Let’s finish with a thought from star Wyclef Love Hewitt: ‘You win some, you loose some, but penis wins most often.’ [3]</p>

        <p>this is weird… we were asked to do a essay on any thing… i done… RUNESCAPE<br>
An essay on Runescape</p>
<p>Man’s greatest achievement? Perhaps not, but can you afford not to read on when I am about to tell you about Runescape? I really, really like Runescape. Indispensable to homosapians today, spasmodically it returns to create a new passion amongst those who study its history. It still has the power to shock so called ‘babies’, obviously. Keeping all of this in mind, in this essay I will examine the major issues.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society is our own everyday reality. When Lance Bandaner said ‘twelve times I’ve traversed the ocean of youthful ambition but society still collects my foot prints’ [1] he was clearly refering to the impact of Runescape on today’s society. Much has been said about the influence of the media on Runescape. Observers claim it irons out misconceptions from our consciousness.</p>
<p>Special care must be taken when analysing such a delicate subject. On the other hand anyone that disagrees with me is an idiot. It has been said that the one thing in society which could survive a nuclear attack is Runescape. This is incorrect, actually cockroaches are the only thing which can survive a nuclear attack.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Our world is driven by supply and demand. We will begin by looking at the Custard-Not-Mustard model, a classic economic system of analysis.<br>
Market<br>
Value<br>
Of<br>
Gold</p>
<pre><code>	Runescape
</code></pre>
<p>Indisputably there is a link. How can this be explained? Even a child could work out that the market value of gold cannot sustain this instability for long. Perhaps to coin a phrase Runescapeeconomics will be the buzz word of the century</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Politics was once a game featuring competitors from elite classes. Comparing the electoral politics of most Western and Eastern European countries is like comparing Runescape and ones own image of themselves.</p>
<p>One quote comes instantly to mind when examining this topic. I mean of course the words of style icon Aaron Rock ‘The success of any political system can only truly be assessed once the fat lady has sung.’ [2] What a fantastic quote. History tells us that Runescape will always be a vote winner, whether we like it, or not.<br>
Is Runescape politically correct, in every sense? Each man, woman and to a lesser extent, child, must make up their own mind.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To conclude, Runescape may not be the best thing since sliced bread, but it’s still important. It collaborates successfully, puts out ‘fires’, and most importantly it perseveres.</p>
<p>Let’s finish with a thought from star Clint Love Hewitt: 'I would say without a shadow of a doubt: Runescape ROCKS!!! [3]</p>

        <blockquote>An essay on Crap
<p>In this essay I will consider the social, economic and political factors of Crap. The constantly changing fashionable take on Crap demonstrates the depth of the subject. While it is becoming a hot topic for debate, several of todays most brilliant minds seem incapable of recognising its increasing relevance to understanding future generations. It still has the power to shock the aristocracy, obviously. With the primary aim of demonstrating my considerable intellect I will now demonstrate the complexity of the many faceted issue that is Crap.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>As Reflected in classical mythology society is complicated. When Lance Bandaner said ‘twelve times I’ve traversed the ocean of youthful ambition but society still collects my foot prints’ [1] he shed new light on Crap, allowing man to take it by the hand and understand its momentum. More a melody to societies dysfunctions than a parody of the self, Crap smells of success.</p>
<p>Of paramount importance to any study of Crap within its context, is understanding the ideals of society. Clearly it promotes higher individualism and obeyence of instinct. As soon as a child meets Crap they are changed.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Increasingly economic growth and innovation are being attributed to Crap. We will study the Inter-Spam model. For those of you unfamiliar with this model it is derived from the Three-Amigos model but with greater emphasis on the outlying gross national product.<br>
Interest</p>
<pre><code>	Crap
</code></pre>
<p>How do we explain these clear trends? Even a child could work out that interest sings a very different tune. What it all comes down to is money. Capitalists love Crap.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Politics was once a game featuring competitors from elite classes. Comparing the general view of politics held by the poor of the west with those of the east can be like comparing the two, equally popular approaches to Crap. If the reader is unaware of these, they need only to turn on the television, or pick up a newspaper or popular magazine.</p>
<p>Let us consider the words of that silver tongued orator, one of the great political analysts Augstin H. Amster ‘A man must have his cake and eat it in order to justify his actions.’ [2] This quotation leads me to suspect that he was not unaccustomed to Crap. It speaks volumes. If Crap be the food of politics, play on.<br>
I wait anxiously. What will the next few years bring for Crap?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To conclude, Crap deserves all of the attention it gets. It enriches, brought up a generation and always chips in.</p>
<p>One final thought from the talented Miles Cruise: ‘It’s been nice educating you.’ [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lol:</p>
<blockquote>To conclude, Crap deserves all of the attention it gets. It enriches, brought up a generation and always chips in.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Crap smells of success.</blockquote> What?!?!
<blockquote>Capitalists love Crap.</blockquote> More like dogs......
<p>[br][size=1]Posted at: November 22, 2006, 01:00:44 PM[/size][hr]</p><blockquote>An essay on America
<p>‘Brilliant’, ‘Quite Good’, ‘What?’, these are just some of the comments made recently in the press regarding America. I really, really like America. Indispensable to homosapians today, it is important to remember that �what goes up must come down.� It is estimated that that America is thought about eight times every day by those most reliant on technology, many of whom fail to comprehend the full scope of America. In the light of this I will break down the issues in order to give each of them the thought that they fully deserve</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society is our own everyday reality. Upon Peter Pinkleton-PishPosh’s return to Britain he remarked ‘class will refelect the inner hero’ [1], he failed to understand that if one seriously intends to ‘not judge a book by its cover’, then one must read a lot of books. A society without America is like a society without knowledge, in that it raises the question ‘why?’</p>
<p>Some analysts have been tempted to disregard America. I haven�t. Society is powered by peer pressure, one of the most powerful forces in the world. As long as peer pressure uses its power for good, America will have its place in society.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Is unemployment inherently bad for an economy? Yes. We will begin by looking at the Custard-Not-Mustard model, as is standard in this case.<br>
National<br>
Debt</p>
<pre><code>	America
</code></pre>
<p>There is no longer a need to argue the importance of America, it is clear to see that the results speak for themselves. The question which surfaces now is, how? Clearly the national debt, ultimately decided by politicians, will always be heavily influenced by America due to its consistently high profile in the portfolio of investors. Many analysts fear a subsequent depression.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Politics, we all agree, is a fact of life. Comparing the ideals of the young with the reality felt by their elders is like contrasting Americaism and post-Americaism.</p>
<p>To quote award winning journalist Vatusia T. Time ‘I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in democracy.’ [2] This quotation leads me to suspect that he was not unaccustomed to America. It speaks volumes. It would be wise to approach the subject with the thought that ‘if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all’. However this can lead to missing out important facts.<br>
I wait anxiously. What will the next few years bring for America?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To reiterate, America is, to use the language of the streets ‘Super Cool.’ It enlightens our daily lives, influences the influencers, and statistically it’s great.</p>
<p>Here with the final word is Hollywood’s Clint De Niro: ‘At first I was afraid I was petrified. Thinking I could never live without America by my side.’ [3]</p>

        <p>GREAT!! </p><blockquote>An essay on ifuckshit<br>
In order to understand our selves, we must first understand ifuckshit. Many an afternoon has been enjoyed by a family, bonding over the discussion of ifuckshit. While it is becoming a hot topic for debate, several of todays most brilliant minds seem incapable of recognising its increasing relevance to understanding future generations. Since it was first compared to antidisestablishmentarianism much has been said concerning ifuckshit by so called ‘babies’, who just don’t like that sort of thing. In the light of this I will break down the issues in order to give each of them the thought that they fully deserve
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society begins and ends with ifuckshit. When Lance Bandaner said ‘twelve times I’ve traversed the ocean of youthful ambition but society still collects my foot prints’ [1] he must have been referning to ifuckshit. Difference among people, race, culture and society is essential on the survival of our world, however ifuckshit smells of success.</p>
<p>Our post-literate society, more than ever before, relies upon ifuckshit. It has been said that the one thing in society which could survive a nuclear attack is ifuckshit. This is incorrect, actually cockroaches are the only thing which can survive a nuclear attack.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>The preceding section may have shed some light on society but to really understand man you must know how he spends his money. We will primarily be focusing on the JTB-Guide-Dog model, a complex but ultimately rewarding system. Transport<br>
Costs</p>
<p>ifuckshit</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons which may be attributed to this unquestionable correlation. Obviously transport costs has always depended upon ifuckshit to a certain extent, but now more that ever. In the light of this free trade must be examined.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Posturing as concerned patriarchs, many politicians guide the electorate herd to the inevitable cattle shed of ‘equal opportunity.’ Comparing the electoral politics of most Western and Eastern European countries is like comparing chalk and cheese.</p>
<p>We cannot talk of ifuckshit and politics without remembering the words of style icon Elijah Skank ‘consciousness complicates a myriad of progressions.’ [2] I couldn’t have put it better my self. When it comes to ifuckshit this is clearly true. If I may be as bold as to paraphrase, he was saying that ‘political ideals are built on the solid cornerstone of ifuckshit.’</p>
<p>I hope, for our sake that ifuckshit will endure.<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>How much responsibility lies with ifuckshit? We can say that ifuckshit is both a need and a want. It replenishes the self, ‘literally’ plants seeds for harvest, and figures show it’s a winning formular.</p>
<p>The final say goes to the award winning Leonardo Travolta: ‘ifuckshit is the new rock and roll! And the new opera!’ [3]</p>

        <blockquote>An essay on Moparscape
<p>In order to understand our selves, we must first understand Moparscape. At one stage or another, every man woman or child will be faced with the issue of Moparscape. Cited by many as the single most important influence on post modern micro eco compartmentalism, it is impossible to overestimate its impact on modern thought. It is an unfortunate consequence of our civilizations history that Moparscape is rarely given rational consideration by those most reliant on technology, who are likely to form a major stronghold in the inevitable battle for hearts and minds. Here begins my indepth analysis of the glourious subject of Moparscape.</p>

        <p>this helped with my RS essay</p>
<p>[</p><blockquote>An essay on runescape<br>
To delve deeply into runescape is an exciting adventure. Many an afternoon has been enjoyed by a family, bonding over the discussion of runescape. Cited by many as the single most important influence on post modern micro eco compartmentalism, spasmodically it returns to create a new passion amongst those who study its history. It still has the power to shock the aristocracy, many of whom blame the influence of television. Though I would rather be in bed I will now examine the primary causes of runescape.
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>There is cultural and institutional interdependence between members of any community. When blues legend ‘Bare Foot D’ remarked ‘awooooh eeee only my dawg understands me’ [1] he was clearly refering to the impact of runescape on today’s society. More a melody to societies dysfunctions than a parody of the self, runescape irons out misconceptions from our consciousness.</p>
<p>Some analysts have been tempted to disregard runescape. I haven?t. To put it simply, people like runescape.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Is unemployment inherently bad for an economy? Yes. Of course, runescape fits perfectly into the Custard-Not-Mustard model, a lovely model. Market<br>
Value<br>
Of<br>
Gold</p>
<p>runescape</p>
<p>When displayed this way it becomes very clear that runescape is of great importance. Recent studies indicate that the market value of gold looms over runescape this cannot be a coincidence. In the light of this free trade must be examined.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Much of the writings of historians display the conquests of the most powerful nations over less powerful ones. Comparing the ideals of the young with the reality felt by their elders is like contrasting runescape now, and its equivalent in the 1800s.</p>
<p>We cannot talk of runescape and politics without remembering the words of the uncompromising Odysseus Bootlegger ‘I don’t believe in ghosts, but I do believe in democracy.’ [2] I argue that his insight into runescape provided the inspiration for these great words. It would be wise to approach the subject with the thought that ‘if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all’. However this can lead to missing out important facts.</p>
<p>While runescape may be a giant amongst men, is it a dwarf amongst policy? I hope not.<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>What can we conclude? Well, runescape has played a large part in the development of man in the 20th Century and its influence remains strong. It brings peace, it stimulates and is a joy to behold.</p>
<p>One final thought from the talented Christina Poppins: ‘I wouldn’t be where I am today without runescape.’</p>

<p>And this helped me with my moparisthebest assesment!</p>
<aside class="quote no-group">
<blockquote>
<p>An essay on <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a><br>
In this essay I will consider the social, economic and political factors of <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>. I find my self constantly drawn back to the subject of <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>. Remarkably <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> is heralded by shopkeepers and investment bankers alike, leading many to state that it is impossible to overestimate its impact on modern thought. It is estimated that that <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> is thought about eight times every day by so called ‘babies’, who form the last great hope for our civilzation. Complex though it is I shall now attempt to provide an exaustive report on <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> and its numerous ‘industries’.</p>
<p>Social Factors</p>
<p>Society is a simple word with a very complex definition. The immortal and indispensable phrase ?honesty is the best policy? [1] shead new light on <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>, allowing man to take it by the hand and understand its momentum. Spanning divides such as class, race and uglyness, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> is crunchy on the outside but soft in the middle.</p>
<p>Our post-literate society, more than ever before, relies upon <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>. To put it simply, people like <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>.</p>
<p>Economic Factors</p>
<p>Economics has been defined as ‘I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine.’ To my learned ear that sounds like two people with itchy backs. Of course, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> fits perfectly into the Spanish-Armada model, a complex but ultimately rewarding system. Housing<br>
Prices</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a></p>
<p>There is no longer a need to argue the importance of <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>, it is clear to see that the results speak for themselves. The question which surfaces now is, how? Clearly housing prices plays in increasingly important role in the market economy. What it all comes down to is money. Capitalists love <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>.</p>
<p>Political Factors</p>
<p>Much of the writings of historians display the conquests of the most powerful nations over less powerful ones. Comparing the ideals of the young with the reality felt by their elders is like contrasting playing with a puppy and singing with a blackbird.</p>
<p>One quote comes instantly to mind when examining this topic. I mean of course the words of one of the great political analysts Augstin Skank ‘political change changes politics, but where does it go?’ [2] Considered by many to be one of the ‘Founding Fathers’ of <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>, his words cannot be over-looked. Perhaps the word which sums up the importance of <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> to politics is ‘participation’.</p>
<p>I wait anxiously. What will the next few years bring for <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a>?<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>To reiterate, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.moparisthebest.com</a> parades along man’s streets and man waves back. It brings peace, ensures financial stability and it is human.</p>
<p>I will leave the last word to the famous Elvis Jackson: ‘It’s been nice educating you.’</p>
