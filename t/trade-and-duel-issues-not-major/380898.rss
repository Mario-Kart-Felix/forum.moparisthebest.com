    <description>hi i have coded and currently host a pretty popular rsps and its now becoming a pain in the arse the fact that if someone sends a trade request if they click to accept it it sends a duel request and also if someone sends a duel request you click to accept and it sends a trade request it works fine if you recieve a request and just request back but we cant carry on like this as we are becoming more popular any help welcome..
if you dont have an answer simple dont post .....
thanks
