umad Luke? I just like to get a reaction out of you because it is funny. Also when i disappeared it is called a job. I cannot be bothered to explain to you what that is since your a lazy bumm. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

I’ve been employed since I was 15. I don’t see how having a job means that you need to suddenly disappear for months without a word to anyone (including your staff) leaving the server to rot only to come back a few months later and critise me for bad ‘adminship’… If by some miracle you really did have to leave for months without any computer access what-so-ever what was stopping you from passing ownership over to someone else whilst you were gone? I remember talking to Tim at the time and he said he had no idea where you had gone to or why it was down etc… Same with that other guy, Soustek or whatever his name was that you admin’d</p>
<p>[quote author=5 1 link=topic=460546.msg3369384#msg3369384 date=1287097838]Shadow had down time? Really? Our server NEVER had down time bro. But yeah, nice try there…</p>
<p>The 2 months our server was up, it was prob down a total of 3-4hrs. Which is GREAT for a new server with barely any subs. Our server was probably the most successful over any other server(But rsca\rsce) in the last 2years.<br>
[/quote]<br>
You’re not getting it… Where is the server now? It’s down. It got popular then started dying and Pomp just left it down. It doesn’t matter whether it’s down to a power outage, misconfiguration, DDoS, lack of care or what… Downtime is downtime. Claiming that it had 3-4 hours downtime in 2 months is utter bullshit, I remember reading post after post of users complaining with people replying saying they had to wait until Pomp gets up and so on. Of course I can’t prove it as the forum has been wiped and to be honest I don’t care about proving it either, it’s just ironic that someone like him criticises how I run my server. Sure other things are important but as a player the most important aspect of a server is knowing that it isn’t just gunna be closed or forgotton about, you want to know that your invested time will still be there tomorrow when you want to play and anyone who played Shadow before has unfortunately seen that first hand.</p>
<p>The thing that is even more funny is that no one except KO9 (IMO) knows what it’s like to run a server for a long time dealing with all the shit that is thrown at you, the larger the community is the harder it is to run and the harder it is to please people, it’s all good and well saying someone has bad adminship when you’re merely a spectator but when you’re in the driving seat it’s a completely different story and I would absolutely love to simulate someone like Pomp running it but unfortunately that’s not possible[/quote]<br>
What do you do now Luke? Hmm? Someone asks you a question and you say “/care” “care cup” “I dont give a fuck” “go talk to pyru”…</p>
<p>The only thing you should be worrying about, is your wilderness. Because when bassleader releases his bot, look to see your player count drop like flies(Like it has been). <a href="http://wartnet.org/index.php/topic,158513.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wartnet.org/index.php/topic,158513.0.html</a></p>

<p>If you call a server that has been running for 14-15 months bad adminship I have no idea what you would refer to your old server as, you had more drama and downtime in a few weeks than we’ve had in over a year before finally deciding to disappear for a few months with absolutely no word to your players. Maybe I should take a few tips off you…</p>
