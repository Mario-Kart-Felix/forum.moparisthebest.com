    <title>Why the hell is Win7 so fucking retarded?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-the-hell-is-win7-so-fucking-retarded/314495</link>
    <description>Alright, few problems here. I&#39;ve had win7 for a while now (3-4 months now) 

and I&#39;ve noticed a SHIT ton of problems with it.

1) When I&#39;m idle, my computer will lock (I didn&#39;t even set this fucking option.)
I have NO idea how to change this.

2) When my computer locks up, I come back, notice that my tower light is flashing (means its locked, or hibrinating or some shit) I login, and EVERYTIME I fucking login my soundcard will just not work, its just like it&#39;ll uninstall until I reboot. (inb4 &quot;REBOOT, DOIT FAGGOT.&quot; Go to #3)
The speakers Icon will just have a O and a line through it, just as if it were muted, but when I double click on it, it says &quot;Microsoft is trying to detect the problem&quot;. When it finally finishes, it says &quot;Your hardware is not responding.&quot;

3) Now I think this is just my hardware, but when I start up my computer, it&#39;ll fucking stay at the manufacturers logo, (compaq) which is the reason why I NEVER turn off my computer. And why this fucking soundcard thing pisses me off so much. Yeah, it&#39;ll stay there for about 20-30 minutes. I&#39;ve spoken to Lin about this, and he said it was my battery. I opened up my computer and checked it, it&#39;s fine.

Anyway, if you got a solution to any of these problems, please post.
And yes, I&#39;ve tried googling. Nothing came up.

P.s. Yes, I do use Linux, but barely ever boot into it (I play games a lot etc)</description>

<p>As for the real battery part, you said your computer froze on the manufacturer’s logo, although you NOW say it gets somewhere. By batteries, I meant these little battery-like things on your motherboard that slowly explode one-by-one, and eventually your computer will just get locked on that screen. It’s happened to me.</p>

Same. It just kept turning off after a few minutes of being on, got it fixed though.[/quote]<br>
Is that when the screen just turns off and after a few seconds, a quick blue screen will show up… (Not BSOD)<br>
Then just reboots?<br>
I got that a few times (3-4)</p>

              <p>Alright, few problems here. I’ve had win7 for a while now (3-4 months now)</p>
<p>and I’ve noticed a SHIT ton of problems with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When I’m idle, my computer will lock (I didn’t even set this fucking option.)<br>
I have NO idea how to change this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When my computer locks up, I come back, notice that my tower light is flashing (means its locked, or hibrinating or some shit) I login, and EVERYTIME I fucking login my soundcard will just not work, its just like it’ll uninstall until I reboot. (inb4 “REBOOT, DOIT FAGGOT.” Go to <span class="hashtag">#3</span>)<br>
The speakers Icon will just have a O and a line through it, just as if it were muted, but when I double click on it, it says “Microsoft is trying to detect the problem”. When it finally finishes, it says “Your hardware is not responding.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I think this is just my hardware, but when I start up my computer, it’ll fucking stay at the manufacturers logo, (compaq) which is the reason why I NEVER turn off my computer. And why this fucking soundcard thing pisses me off so much. Yeah, it’ll stay there for about 20-30 minutes. I’ve spoken to Lin about this, and he said it was my battery. I opened up my computer and checked it, it’s fine.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, if you got a solution to any of these problems, please post.<br>
And yes, I’ve tried googling. Nothing came up.</p>
<p>P.s. Yes, I do use Linux, but barely ever boot into it (I play games a lot etc)</p>
