    <description>Is anyone here also getting these messages from Jagex ?
&lt;blockquote&gt;January 27th, 2012.



To Whom It May Concern;



I hereby certify under penalty of perjury that I am the owner or am authorised to act on behalf of the copyright owner. The information in the notification is accurate. I have good faith to belief that the use of the material identified below has not been authorised by the owner, its agents or the law.



I represent Jagex Limited (“Jagex”), developer and publisher of massively multiplayer online games. Jagex has owned and operated RuneScape, the well-known online multiplayer adventure game, at the website www.runescape.com since 2001. 



We have reason to believe that (at the time of writing), a website hosted on your system is violating your Acceptable Use Policy by distributing pirated software and copyright infringing material.





Concerning *******.com (IP Address: ********) (“the Website”)



Under Sections 512(c)(3) and 512 (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) and 512(3)), we are hereby giving you notification that;



Jagex Limited (UK registered company number 03982706) is the exclusive owner of the copyrights to the RuneScape massively multiplayer online game, the associated www.runescape.com website and the text, artwork, logos and other material appearing therein, except where otherwise stated.


a) A full and representative list of the RuneScape material can be viewed at www.runescape.com. 

The Website, and therefore one of your customers, is violating your Acceptable Use Policy by distributing pirated software and copyright infringing content. The Website has reproduced, without consent or license, elements of RuneScape material, and is hosting, as well as knowingly providing links to, a pirated and modified RuneScape Game Client.


a) The Website is involved in unauthorized distribution of a modified RuneScape Game Client, also known as the “***** Game Client”. 
The pirated and illegitimately modified version of the RuneScape Game Client is provided for public access at the following addresses:



www.*********/webclient/



The ***** Game Client is a duplication of the official RuneScape Game Client materials (including copyrighted names and artwork) available for review at http://www.runescape.com/game.ws?aut...=true&amp;ab=1&amp;j=1, reproduced without consent or license. 



Reproduction and modification of the RuneScape Game Client is only possible by circumventing the protective systems enacted by Jagex Limited, thereby gaining access to, and distributing, part of the source code for the RuneScape game. 

This is a clear breach of copyright, involving copying of the source code as well as the appearance of the game in terms of overall impression, interfaces, text and images. 



Furthermore, in providing the client for play by others the Website is committing contributory and vicarious copyright infringement, as well as it is encouraging others to breach their contract with Jagex Limited, the terms of which clearly state: “You must not use a modified/customized version of the client software or attempt to sub-license it. You must not create or provide any other means by which any Jagex Product may be played by others (including, without limitation, replacement or modified client/server software, server emulators).”



In accordance with Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act you are bound by law to prevent the referring or linking of users to an online location containing infringing material by using information location tools, including a directory, index, reference, pointer or hypertext link, in order to claim a safe harbor from liability for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement.



Accordingly, Jagex Limited requires that you act expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the web page listed above. 





Should you have any concerns or questions, please contact copyright@jagex.com or phone us on 0844.588.6689. 



Yours faithfully,



/Harriet Lester/

As the poster above me has already stated, an offshore vps/dedicated may help with legal issues depending on risk the host is willing to take and whether they care or not about the Digital Millennium Copyright Act(DMCA). I’ve just purchased a dedicated server from Leaseweb in NL. I’m not sure whether they do care or not but I’ve read some good reviews about their service, I’ll keep everyone here posted on how it goes.</p>
