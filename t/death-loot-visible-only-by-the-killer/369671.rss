    <title>Death loot visible only by the killer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/death-loot-visible-only-by-the-killer/369671</link>
    <description>I&#39;m looking for help on this tricky problem, I&#39;m trying to figure out how to stop a third party from viewing the loot dropped by players.

I would like the loot from a players death to be only seen by his killer, stopping loot stealing/harvesting from a random player.


Thank you in advance, Rosejuice.</description>
