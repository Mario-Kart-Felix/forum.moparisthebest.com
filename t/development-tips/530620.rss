    <description>Hi all, I&#39;ve been browsing around these forums and checking out many different server bases, trying to learn a thing or two about Runescape Coding for a few weeks now. I&#39;ve come to the realisation that I am just not learning a great deal. I have tried to teach myself as much as possible and write my own skills/features only to find myself copy and pasting or just quitting overly frustrated. I now think I should take a step back and take the time to just really grab a strong understanding of how RSPS&#39;s are constructed an written, what are the main features of in the code of runescape servers.

I would like to ask the community for some advice, some material they have used to learn themselves really how to write great servers.

So please leave your thoughts, strategies, material and knowledge.</description>
