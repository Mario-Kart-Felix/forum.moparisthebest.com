    <description>Okay so most of you know me right? Okay good, none of you know me. I require your expertise in a very delicate domain, that is of course the Runescape Classic Sprites. How exactly does the character work in terms of wielding items and changing its look. Aside from that, I have done some research and I&#39;ve stumbled upon some pretty interesting information about this, firstly each body part of the character has a specific ID that represents it and that is rendered (I guess). I sort of need to know how this all functions for a 2D game of mine.</description>

<p>character-facing 4 would be SE. (North = 1, East = 3, South = 5, West = 7, etc). Then you can interpret this file. Say head has actually 8 files associated with it. So if your head is 1, and you’re facing SE which is 4, then read it as pulling head_14 sprite. And if your head is 2 and you’re facing north, head_21 sprite. If you have 10 different head options, 10 torso options, 10 leg options, there are going to be 240 sprites, and 8,000 possible combinations.</p>
<p>Not sure if that makes sense, but that’s the way I would do it. And I’m pretty sure RSC has a similar method.</p>

<p>Yes, I get it now. I was sort of aiming to that. This made it perfectly clear. I’m guessing the RS2 uses a different method of rendering. But this is a perfect explanation, thank you so much.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah no problem. I’m not sure if they do it with cardinal directions like that, but that’s the idea. Who even knows how RS2 does it. I’m pretty sure they just have 3D models of the heads, torso’s, legs, and gear. And they have some type of engine that compiles them. That’s my best guess, haha.[/quote]<br>
Considering they use OpenGL, my best guess is that is the engine they may use. Yet again, the principle is the same. Again, thank you for your help</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>RSC sprites have a specific order they have to go in depending on the angle of a character. Otherwise, you might get torsos overlapping chainmails, etc. Anyway, they work similar to how Limits described. There are about 1300 sprites in RSC, and a few hundred animations. An individule animation described each angle and the colour of a set of sprites to be used for NPCs, equipement or players. Each sprite has a width, height and offsets. The offsets determine where to place the sprite on a 2D plane.</p>

<p>And the concept is basic. Have a configuration file (or code it in java) that finds the equipment slot that the item should go in. Then have a certain pixel on the screen (for example, a chestpiece’s pixel would be in the center of the player sprite) render the corresponding image with that pixel as the center.[/quote]</p>
<p>That is actually so much less complicated than I thought, I will give it a try and for your question, yes.<br>
EDIT: What could also work is create a character composed of more than one sprite.</p>
