This was all set up in discussions between me, Mopman, and t4.</p>
<p>This is what‚Äôs going to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mopman‚Äôs and t4‚Äôs servers will be linked</li>
<li>t4 will run services</li>
<li>Paid operators are gone, and will never return</li>
<li>No one will ever link other servers without extensive community agreement</li>
<li>No one will add any oper without complete approval by the full oper group (currently t4, Mopman, Niall, Tom, tL, c`p, and eXemplar)</li>
<li>t4‚Äôs services/server will be backed up to my server approx weekly</li>
<li>
<a href="http://irc.moparisthebest.com/irc.moparisthebest.com" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.moparisthebest.com/irc.moparisthebest.com</a> will round-robin between both servers directly, I‚Äôll also supply ssl certs</li>
</ol>
<p>For now the DNS has been repointed to t4‚Äôs server (might take a bit to propagate), but because it‚Äôs super late certs and linking won‚Äôt happen until tommorow at the earliest, and ssl certs afterwards (for now you‚Äôll have to accept warnings, yuck).</p>
<p>I think that‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs nice to know we are actually all adults here, and though huge misunderstandings do happen we can overcome them. :)[/quote]<br>

Original post:<br>
I really hate having to do this.</p>
<p>Timeline:</p>
<ol>
<li>ddos</li>
</ol>
<p>The irc server was repeatedly ddosed over a period of a few days and the current host at the time, digitalocean, basically washed their hands of me.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Migration to ddos protected host</li>
</ol>
<p>So then I moved the irc and services to a new host, ovh in canada, to be on their ddos protected architecture. This was fine. Actually there stuff is quote good, for the price. I‚Äôd definitely recommend them if anyone was looking for a cheap host with decent ddos protection.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Linking to t4</li>
</ol>
<p>During this time, I decided to relax my restrictions on linking, as in the past evidence has clearly demonstrated that more links = more problems. However, when one server was ddosed, the links kept dropping. Both servers were protected under the same ddos architecture. So I decided t4 seemed like a fairly trustworthy and nice guy, and he offered to host the whole network. Since his server was a dedi which was more expensive than my vps, I decided to move the network over to t4‚Äôs. Now this was very spur of the moment and we didn‚Äôt really talk about roles and responsibilities which was definitely my fault.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>t4/mepholic/me</li>
</ol>
<p>Also during this time, t4, myself, mepholic and mopman (and c`p i think?) for a little bit, were in a channel discussing what was happening and what was being done. I wasn‚Äôt able to pay a lot of attention to this channel, especially given the time difference between america and australia. In this channel, t4 and mepholic discussed linking a server, and mepholic went ahead and apparently purchased a year of some expensive vps, without getting a yes from me. I specifically stated I did not trust mepholic to t4 and do not link with him, repeatedly. I didn‚Äôt really believe any of the things that people have said mepholic has done, and I defended him against personal attacks after I‚Äôd banned him, but I still had no reason to trust him and was doubly untrusting after his continued interest after the server had been ddosed repeatedly into the ground.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>mepholic/t4</li>
</ol>
<p>I‚Äôve been very busy with exams recently, however I noticed there was suddenly a new server on the network and mepholic was an operator. I thought it was strange t4 would take actions like this without talking to me, especially after me specifically my distrust of mepholic stating that in the past. Then however, I couldn‚Äôt get in via ssh and suddenly suspected the worst, so I banned both of them and killed mepholics server. I realised t4 may not be able to get back in to talk so I unbanned him. t4 had also threatened to go to mitb and request that he change the cname for <a href="http://irc.mitb.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">irc.mitb.com</a></p>
<p>At this point, I could have taken the irc back to my own server and keep hosting it as usual without more drama, but I wanted to talk to t4 and find out the who/what/why. You know, discuss it like adults.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>me/t4 discussion</li>
</ol>
<p>I come back after a couple of exams to abuse from mepholic which was a little sad, and veiled anger from t4, which was understandable. After expressing how grateful I was that t4 was hosting the server, and discussing with t4 about roles and responsibilities and distrust, and after a bit of back and forword i wrote up a couple of things I thought we needed to get written in the sand.</p>
<p><code>[14:38:07] &lt;eXemplar&gt; okso
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; basically, these are the conditions upon your continued hosting of the server, not of running the network,
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; 1) you (and no one else other than me) have no access to running services (ie no oper class in atheme.conf) - the services are setup in such a way that they should be self moderating (actually thats a good point, is an mta setup to forward ns registration/forgotten pw?). i'm trusting you with the db such as it is cuz i don't believe you're the kind of person who'd attempt to attack it
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; 2) you will be on an oper level below me, i don't care if it's above everyone else
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; 3) you will talk to me for confirmation before making any changes to network. i'm a pretty ammenable guy and i'm open to change. i don't care how much you've rebranded the config up to now, but in future, you come to me prior
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; my past experiences with this network have shown that services access is the most abusable part of irc, and thus i made a decision to have no one else having access to it, which has proven a very good decision even though it made people unhappy.
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; and as multiple people have also stated, experience shows that problems rise incrementally with linking servers. i thought as you did now, but with zachera. it was also an unpopular decision and i defended him as much as i could, but in the end it just led to problems so it's flat out not a good idea unless out of pure necessity. which it shouldn't considering this host can withstand attacks like that now
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; remember we are doing this for the people using the network, not for us, which means engendering trust and treating it seriously, even if it is not important
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; savvy ?
[14:44:13] &lt;t4&gt; it don't think it makes any sense to bar me from services if the flat files are sitting right on my disk...
[14:44:46] &lt;t4&gt; the oper level thing doesn't make any sense either
[14:45:06] &lt;t4&gt; there's no sense in right restricting me other than to inflate yourself
[14:45:13] &lt;t4&gt; if i want to abuse something i simply just will
[14:45:41] &lt;t4&gt; as far as asking about config changes, sure i guess? there's really nothing to change in the config...
[14:46:36] &lt;t4&gt; you're treating this as if you've got some kind of god complex
[14:54:55] &lt;t4&gt; well, eXemplar ?
[14:58:21] &lt;eXemplar&gt; like i said, it's my fault for not being more upfront and clear when we entered into this arrangement, and i'm sorry for that</code></p>
<p>Now I‚Äôd like to just explain this a bit. Services are the number one reason behind abuse in a network, especially as they contain potentially identifying information. And while this irc might not be important in the grand scheme of things, I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôve gained everyone‚Äôs trust through this period of hosting irc. It has always been my policy that no one has access to services and they be self-regulating as much as possible. No channel interference and things like that too. Also, when there hasn‚Äôt been a single op at the top, things have gone wrong in the past where bans can get very ugly and full of drama/issues.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Take over</li>
</ol>
<p>After this there was nothing, no response from t4, nothing, however a statement was made that he would be shutting down the irc in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>. Honestly this feels like a bit of a kick in the gut and I am definitely questioning trusting t4 with any of this in the first place, and then in basically a veiled tantrum he then proceeded to remove my oper and effectively take over the network. I tried to explain all of this in <span class="hashtag">#mopar</span>, however everyone was just super angry and there was a lot of vitriol spouted. I feel a little sad that I thought I could trust him to be reasonable about things, but I‚Äôm happy to let this be if everyone wants this to continue. I‚Äôd really like to think they weren‚Äôt the kind of people to do this, but I guess this always seems to happen with irc. If I was a suspicious person, I might think some of this was actually orchestrated, though I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why someone would bother with our small network.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Now</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, my policy has always to be as hands off in irc as possible. Apart from the occasional humorous /kill we‚Äôve had 0 problems for the past ‚Ä¶ 4? 5? years?. But after defending mepholic and not wanting to drag drama into this whole thing I think it‚Äôs important the community makes a decision. I‚Äôve also made this expressly clear to the ircops that they are there to protect the network, not partake in individual crusades or drama, and this has actually been quite successful too, even with the people disliking the new operators there has been no major issues and I think it‚Äôs good to have a wider selection of people around in case something happens in different time zones.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Next</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, just thought I‚Äôd get that out there, what should I do? I‚Äôm happy to just continue as is, I mean no skin off my nose (though I would suggest everyone change their passwords and be sure to use bnc‚Äôs and that people use OTR encryption when PMing others). Can hand the domain over or everyone just go back to using the .com, not sure about the ssl cert. Would also welcome some input from moparisthebest as he inquired what was happening but I never heard back.</p>

        <p>Personally I‚Äôd like to see the network put back in exemplar‚Äôs hands if he‚Äôs not totally put off by this whole ordeal. We‚Äôve had a more stable network with him than we‚Äôve had in years, and opers have, generally, been fairer in their actions than previous years.</p>
<p>Only about 3 names come to mind when I consider who could be trusted and considered experienced enough to run the network and by now it‚Äôs become very apparent that when we do add MOAR NODEZ it only creates further problems, not just from a technical standpoint but this silly, juvenile drama that erupts every time we do.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôve always been happy with eXemplar‚Äôs management of the network, he‚Äôs very experienced with it. While we‚Äôve disagreed about certain things such as the sale of power, he‚Äôs given me a reasonable enough argument to reassure me on the safety of it. As far as I‚Äôm concerned eXemplar should be the one running things, I have no issue with other people taking up roles, but only under the supervision of eXemplar. The situation does come across as childish, therefore I‚Äôll forward this to Moparisthebest for clarity.</p>
<p>I‚Äôd be hard pushed to recognise what‚Äôs going on as legitimate.</p>

        <p>Random thoughts from your ex benevolent dictator:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exemplar has done a pretty fantastic job managing the network (in his typical mostly hands-off manner) since I could no longer do it. We‚Äôve had our disagreements (selling oper lol) but nothing major and I have no complaints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish he‚Äôd brought up his lack of motivation to continue hosting it / money issues / whatever it is. I‚Äôd have been willing to pay for the network again to avoid all this dick waving. I only ever stopped paying for it because of personal situation which is no longer an issue, not because I hate you all now or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did bring up privately to exemplar that I felt a little apprehensive about the changes. Mainly because things were pretty good as they are, and big upheavals historically cause ALL OF DIS fudgeIN DRAMAZ. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> But also because issues with how it was being handled (we need to keep it small, we don‚Äôt need lots of unproven potential issue causing opers, etc.) First thing that happened after this DDOS is that people started wanting to link nodes left and right, and that has never gone well. (ted and his son, anyone?) Believe it or not, between Exemplar and myself we do have quite a few years of experience running this thing, now. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> We don‚Äôt refuse links/olines etc. just to be assholes‚Ä¶</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My private comments were supposed to remain so, and have probably contributed quite a bit to this drama since they they became public. I would have been nicer and a bit clearer had I known they were going to be told to every tom dick and harry, so sorry if anyone was offended. <em>shrug</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the drama is silly, can we go back to cat pictures now, whoever hosts the fudgeing thing?</p>

        <p>I just realised my O:Line has been revoked. In that case, I think we should drop t4/mepholics server from roundrobin and have someone else stand one up I‚Äôm afraid. No offense to t4, but dropping multiple O:Lines for no reason (I haven‚Äôt even been informed, let alone any discussion) is not really kosher. I didn‚Äôt really have anything against t4 running the server until I realised he‚Äôd done that.</p>
