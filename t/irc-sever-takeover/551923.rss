    <description>moparisthebest edit:
[quote=&quot;Moparisthebest&quot;]Alright!  Everyone has came back together as one big happy family again! :)  Both sides agreed to some concessions and we have a great plan.  This was all set up in discussions between me, Mopman, and t4.

This is what&#39;s going to happen:

1. Mopman&#39;s and t4&#39;s servers will be linked
2. t4 will run services
3. Paid operators are gone, and will never return
4. No one will ever link other servers without extensive community agreement
5. No one will add any oper without complete approval by the full oper group (currently t4, Mopman, Niall, Tom, tL, c`p, and eXemplar)
6. t4&#39;s services/server will be backed up to my server approx weekly
7. irc.moparisthebest.com/irc.moparisthebest.com will round-robin between both servers directly, I&#39;ll also supply ssl certs

For now the DNS has been repointed to t4&#39;s server (might take a bit to propagate), but because it&#39;s super late certs and linking won&#39;t happen until tommorow at the earliest, and ssl certs afterwards (for now you&#39;ll have to accept warnings, yuck).

I think that&#39;s it, it&#39;s nice to know we are actually all adults here, and though huge misunderstandings do happen we can overcome them. :)[/quote]
/moparisthebest edit
Original post:
I really hate having to do this.

Timeline:

1. ddos

The irc server was repeatedly ddosed over a period of a few days and the current host at the time, digitalocean, basically washed their hands of me.

2. Migration to ddos protected host

So then I moved the irc and services to a new host, ovh in canada, to be on their ddos protected architecture. This was fine. Actually there stuff is quote good, for the price. I&#39;d definitely recommend them if anyone was looking for a cheap host with decent ddos protection.

3. Linking to t4

During this time, I decided to relax my restrictions on linking, as in the past evidence has clearly demonstrated that more links = more problems. However, when one server was ddosed, the links kept dropping. Both servers were protected under the same ddos architecture. So I decided t4 seemed like a fairly trustworthy and nice guy, and he offered to host the whole network. Since his server was a dedi which was more expensive than my vps, I decided to move the network over to t4&#39;s. Now this was very spur of the moment and we didn&#39;t really talk about roles and responsibilities which was definitely my fault.

4. t4/mepholic/me

Also during this time, t4, myself, mepholic and mopman (and c`p i think?) for a little bit, were in a channel discussing what was happening and what was being done. I wasn&#39;t able to pay a lot of attention to this channel, especially given the time difference between america and australia. In this channel, t4 and mepholic discussed linking a server, and mepholic went ahead and apparently purchased a year of some expensive vps, without getting a yes from me. I specifically stated I did not trust mepholic to t4 and do not link with him, repeatedly. I didn&#39;t really believe any of the things that people have said mepholic has done, and I defended him against personal attacks after I&#39;d banned him, but I still had no reason to trust him and was doubly untrusting after his continued interest after the server had been ddosed repeatedly into the ground.

5. mepholic/t4

I&#39;ve been very busy with exams recently, however I noticed there was suddenly a new server on the network and mepholic was an operator. I thought it was strange t4 would take actions like this without talking to me, especially after me specifically my distrust of mepholic stating that in the past. Then however, I couldn&#39;t get in via ssh and suddenly suspected the worst, so I banned both of them and killed mepholics server. I realised t4 may not be able to get back in to talk so I unbanned him. t4 had also threatened to go to mitb and request that he change the cname for irc.mitb.com

At this point, I could have taken the irc back to my own server and keep hosting it as usual without more drama, but I wanted to talk to t4 and find out the who/what/why. You know, discuss it like adults.

6. me/t4 discussion

I come back after a couple of exams to abuse from mepholic which was a little sad, and veiled anger from t4, which was understandable. After expressing how grateful I was that t4 was hosting the server, and discussing with t4 about roles and responsibilities and distrust, and after a bit of back and forword i wrote up a couple of things I thought we needed to get written in the sand.

[code][14:38:07] &lt;eXemplar&gt; okso
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; basically, these are the conditions upon your continued hosting of the server, not of running the network,
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; 1) you (and no one else other than me) have no access to running services (ie no oper class in atheme.conf) - the services are setup in such a way that they should be self moderating (actually thats a good point, is an mta setup to forward ns registration/forgotten pw?). i&#39;m trusting you with the db such as it is cuz i don&#39;t believe you&#39;re the kind of person who&#39;d attempt to attack it
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; 2) you will be on an oper level below me, i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s above everyone else
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; 3) you will talk to me for confirmation before making any changes to network. i&#39;m a pretty ammenable guy and i&#39;m open to change. i don&#39;t care how much you&#39;ve rebranded the config up to now, but in future, you come to me prior
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; my past experiences with this network have shown that services access is the most abusable part of irc, and thus i made a decision to have no one else having access to it, which has proven a very good decision even though it made people unhappy.
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; and as multiple people have also stated, experience shows that problems rise incrementally with linking servers. i thought as you did now, but with zachera. it was also an unpopular decision and i defended him as much as i could, but in the end it just led to problems so it&#39;s flat out not a good idea unless out of pure necessity. which it shouldn&#39;t considering this host can withstand attacks like that now
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; remember we are doing this for the people using the network, not for us, which means engendering trust and treating it seriously, even if it is not important
[14:41:55] &lt;eXemplar&gt; savvy ?
[14:44:13] &lt;t4&gt; it don&#39;t think it makes any sense to bar me from services if the flat files are sitting right on my disk...
[14:44:46] &lt;t4&gt; the oper level thing doesn&#39;t make any sense either
[14:45:06] &lt;t4&gt; there&#39;s no sense in right restricting me other than to inflate yourself
[14:45:13] &lt;t4&gt; if i want to abuse something i simply just will
[14:45:41] &lt;t4&gt; as far as asking about config changes, sure i guess? there&#39;s really nothing to change in the config...
[14:46:36] &lt;t4&gt; you&#39;re treating this as if you&#39;ve got some kind of god complex
[14:54:55] &lt;t4&gt; well, eXemplar ?
[14:58:21] &lt;eXemplar&gt; like i said, it&#39;s my fault for not being more upfront and clear when we entered into this arrangement, and i&#39;m sorry for that[/code]

Now I&#39;d like to just explain this a bit. Services are the number one reason behind abuse in a network, especially as they contain potentially identifying information. And while this irc might not be important in the grand scheme of things, I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve gained everyone&#39;s trust through this period of hosting irc. It has always been my policy that no one has access to services and they be self-regulating as much as possible. No channel interference and things like that too. Also, when there hasn&#39;t been a single op at the top, things have gone wrong in the past where bans can get very ugly and full of drama/issues.

7. Take over

After this there was nothing, no response from t4, nothing, however a statement was made that he would be shutting down the irc in #mopar. Honestly this feels like a bit of a kick in the gut and I am definitely questioning trusting t4 with any of this in the first place, and then in basically a veiled tantrum he then proceeded to remove my oper and effectively take over the network. I tried to explain all of this in #mopar, however everyone was just super angry and there was a lot of vitriol spouted. I feel a little sad that I thought I could trust him to be reasonable about things, but I&#39;m happy to let this be if everyone wants this to continue. I&#39;d really like to think they weren&#39;t the kind of people to do this, but I guess this always seems to happen with irc. If I was a suspicious person, I might think some of this was actually orchestrated, though I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out why someone would bother with our small network.

8. Now

Now, my policy has always to be as hands off in irc as possible. Apart from the occasional humorous /kill we&#39;ve had 0 problems for the past ... 4? 5? years?. But after defending mepholic and not wanting to drag drama into this whole thing I think it&#39;s important the community makes a decision. I&#39;ve also made this expressly clear to the ircops that they are there to protect the network, not partake in individual crusades or drama, and this has actually been quite successful too, even with the people disliking the new operators there has been no major issues and I think it&#39;s good to have a wider selection of people around in case something happens in different time zones.

9. Next

Anyway, just thought I&#39;d get that out there, what should I do? I&#39;m happy to just continue as is, I mean no skin off my nose (though I would suggest everyone change their passwords and be sure to use bnc&#39;s and that people use OTR encryption when PMing others). Can hand the domain over or everyone just go back to using the .com, not sure about the ssl cert. Would also welcome some input from moparisthebest as he inquired what was happening but I never heard back.</description>

21:48:17           @t4 | baristatam: the fact of the matter is i have an operator who's willing to take it upon himself to take over

21:48:39    baristatam | soooo
21:48:41    baristatam | ok?
21:48:42        Mopman | t4: proved how?

                       | it
21:49:42        Mopman | lawl: and him giving away that ownership was unfoetunately a mistake
21:49:50           c`p | how did t4 take over the network exactly, eXemplar passed the task of running it over to him under some
                       | conditions.  linking with mepholic was a mistake but attempting to assert control over t4's property does not

                     currently holds an active O-line to make sure things stay in order (that can be removed if you wish). I
                      didn't want eXemplar shutting down or juping the server while this discussion was taking place through his
                     own O-line or another (the passwords carried over from his old config).

And this is why opers are disabled!

<p>I would have COMPLETELY understood that if he wasn’t being a fool about it, I would have agreed and given him a better reason. I honestly see that through these four pages that people want the exemplar person to run it, but my point was because of this power struggle and what not - why not let the administrators run it? Given that none of them have quoted my post or responded towards it, they don’t want to (for the admins that have visited the topics over-and-over and read the replies). It was a simple thing to say, there was no reason for him to do that.</p>

<p>There were serious hardware issues with the VPSs we originally purchased and I think eXemplar wanted to keep costs down (which isn’t a fault of his own). A dedicate server tends to more expensive, you get what you pay for.</p>

 yea the first thing t4/mepholic wanted me to do was remove the CNAME for xxx and change it to an A record for their server, removing exemplars control lol[/quote]<br>
Oh and eXemplar was supposed to be the power hungry one with a god complex… Riiigggghhhhhhhhhht.[/quote]<br>
the xxx was cute but renewing it for a year caused a bunch of drama with p2w opers (that’s how it was paid for). renewing it again is a waste of money and we shouldn’t do it, so the CNAME should go away anyway. I’m actually really confused why did a cname to xxx instead of the opposite (having xxx cname to .com)</p>
<p>and i agree with their request… why is does exemplar deserve control of it? is it some sorta privilege to run the server? its a hassle more than a privilege and I don’t see any other than loss of power</p>

You guys are right that eXemplar has been hosting it successfully for the last few years but the DDOS broke that streak and you can’t just ignore that.<br>

<p>eXemplar is the one who fixed the DDOS issues, too. t4 came after it was already fixed.[/quote]<br>

I haven’t gone through the four pages of this thread, only skimmed it. If he has chosen not to deal with the IRC anymore then why not allow MITB, Tom, or yourself to host it from now one? It’ll be a lot easier than letting a member deal with it since you know, an administrator dealing with it from then on. It’ll get rid of this drama for that matter.[/quote]<br>
I like how everyone who has posted for eXemplar to “run the IRCd” (or others, what the fudge?) are either PAY2WIN operators, Mopman et. al., and people that don’t even use the IRCd, lol.</p>

<p>Can you read? Please stop being the source of all this drama. We all know eXemplar doesn’t trust mepholic because he ascertained his opinion from Mopman and yourself, both of which have a problem with mepholic because baristatam (you) were an ex-girl friend of mepholic’s who <span class="bbcode-s">cheated on</span> left him for Mopman (or something to that effect). Point is: alterior motives - there is tension between the two parties.</p>

<p>On the O-lines: I changed the passwords and many of you were offline. I got back to tL about it, and c`p currently holds an active O-line to make sure things stay in order (that can be removed if you wish). I didn’t want eXemplar shutting down or juping the server while this discussion was taking place through his own O-line or another (the passwords carried over from his old config). Distrustful, sure, but my goal here is to resolve this and provide a stable ircd.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Let me reiterate:</p>
<aside class="quote" data-post="39" data-topic="551923">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
 t4:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>This can all be resolved if eXemplar agrees that his contract is a ridiculous ego-booster, I agree to never link another server, the PAY2WIN opers are removed, eXemplar and I have (and maybe the other opers) have an equal say, and the old opers are restored. I don’t see how the community loses with the aforementioned reconciliation.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The IRCd is up and no one really cares about the on going ‘power struggle’ if you want to call it that. To my knowledge, everyone’s chatting away about the typical subjects.</p>
