              <p>[quote="_s, post:2, topic:362936"]so you were making tea in intervals and you tried to put in an ip and a port? no wonder it’s not working!</p>
<p>what you need to do is first avoid putting the ip and port into the teapot, mainly because the ip is virtual and the port is probably way too big (how did you move it anyway?)</p>
<p>next, if you haven’t boiled the kettle already i suggest you do so. you then put teabags into the teapot and pour the hot water in and try to avoid burning yourself!</p>
<p>after you have done this, stir the tea gently and pour the tea into some cups. add milk or sugar or anything else you’d like in tea, and enjoy your nice cup of tea.<br>
