    <title>Been a week</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/been-a-week/426189</link>
    <description>Of posting thread after thread trying to find someone to help me fix my problem. Nobody can so far... kinda lame. I really wanted to be able to host my own private server, i feel like if i have the abilities to code one, i should be able to put it online to have everyone play, and improve it throughout time.

My problem; My problem is that i cannot get my server online. My internet allows portforwarding, i&#39;ve portforwarded, i&#39;ve used no-ip, tried hamachi (not to familiar with that), change the ip on my client (although some dumbass changed it to something weird yesterday, obviously having no idea what he was doing), looked through my firewall to allow port 43594, and EVERYTHING i feel like i can possibly do.

I really need some help here, Moparians, come on, lend a hand?

**PS. I NEED SOMEONE THAT ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING THIS TIME.</description>
