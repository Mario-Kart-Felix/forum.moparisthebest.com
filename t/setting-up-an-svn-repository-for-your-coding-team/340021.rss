    <description>[b][size=36pt]Setting up an SVN repository for your coding team[/size][/b]


[center][b]What is an SVN repository?[/b][/center]

An SVN repository is a...SVN repository! SVN means &quot;Subversion&quot;, and it&#39;s a method of sharing files between an entire team VERY easily. It&#39;s also a version control system--every single change is archived, so if you completely screw up your code irreparably, you can fall back on automated backups.


[center][b]Why do I need an SVN repository?[/b][/center]

If you have a multi-member development team, it&#39;s often very easy to get confused as to who has what version of what file. With an SVN repository, that is no longer a problem. Every file is stored on a central server. Coders are able to commit--or update--a file to the server, and then a new version will be created. Then, all the rest of the team has to do is right-click that file and choose to download the latest version.


[center][b]Don&#39;t I need a client for this?[/b][/center]

Yes, you do. Thankfully, there&#39;s a free and easy client to do just what we just described. It&#39;s called TortoiseSVN, and it can be downloaded [url=http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/]here[/url]. Just download and install!


[center][b]Ok, so now what about the main server? How do I get that?[/b][/center]

You&#39;re in luck! There are a few places to get free private SVN repositories. One such place is at [url=http://www.assembla.com/spaces/free-private-subversion-repository-only/prepare_copy?catalog=49]Assembla[/url]. That link will take you to a register page, with the free plan already picked out.


[center][b]Now, how do I get the FIRST revision up to the SVN server?[/b][/center]
There may be an easier method, but this is how I know to do it. First, log into your assembla account. Then, click &quot;start&quot; on the top bar. Choose your SVN repository from the &quot;spaces you collaborate with&quot; field. When you click it, you&#39;ll be brought to a page. There will be some big words that say &quot;SVN url:&quot; followed by a link. Copy that link, then go to your code. Copy the folder that ALL your code and players etc. reside in, then paste it somewhere else that&#39;s NOT IN THE SAME FOLDER. Then, right click it and choose &quot;TortoiseSVN&quot;, then click &quot;Import&quot;. When it asks, put the link you copied into the &quot;URL of repository&quot; section. If it asks for a password, enter your Assembla login details.

[center][b]But then how do I get the files when someone else uploads one?[/b][/center]
Ok, now go back to your ORIGINAL code folder. Right click it, and choose &quot;SVN checkout&quot;. It will again ask for the SVN url. Put it in, and ignore the rest of the options. If it asks for a login, you know what to put in. Then, whenever you want to receive an update, right click that folder again and choose &quot;SVN update&quot;. It will download any files that are different than what you have.

[center][b]Now how do I upload a file?[/b][/center]
Right click the file you want to upload, and choose &quot;SVN commit&quot;.

[center][b]How do I add other people to my SVN repository?[/b][/center]

You have two options. You could either give them your login details, so they don&#39;t need to register, but then you won&#39;t know who uploaded what. The other option is to have them register on assembla, then invite them via email into your repository. Then when they commit or checkout, they just put in THEIR credentials. To invite them, go to your SVN repository&#39;s page, then click &quot;Team&quot; on the top bar. Then just choose to invite people via username or email on the bar to the right.</description>

<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">What is an SVN repository?</span>[/center]</p>
<p>An SVN repository is a…SVN repository! SVN means “Subversion”, and it’s a method of sharing files between an entire team VERY easily. It’s also a version control system–every single change is archived, so if you completely screw up your code irreparably, you can fall back on automated backups.</p>

<p>If you have a multi-member development team, it’s often very easy to get confused as to who has what version of what file. With an SVN repository, that is no longer a problem. Every file is stored on a central server. Coders are able to commit–or update–a file to the server, and then a new version will be created. Then, all the rest of the team has to do is right-click that file and choose to download the latest version.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Don’t I need a client for this?</span>[/center]</p>
<p>Yes, you do. Thankfully, there’s a free and easy client to do just what we just described. It’s called TortoiseSVN, and it can be downloaded <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. Just download and install!</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Ok, so now what about the main server? How do I get that?</span>[/center]</p>
<p>You’re in luck! There are a few places to get free private SVN repositories. One such place is at <a href="http://www.assembla.com/spaces/free-private-subversion-repository-only/prepare_copy?catalog=49" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Assembla</a>. That link will take you to a register page, with the free plan already picked out.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Now, how do I get the FIRST revision up to the SVN server?</span>[/center]<br>
There may be an easier method, but this is how I know to do it. First, log into your assembla account. Then, click “start” on the top bar. Choose your SVN repository from the “spaces you collaborate with” field. When you click it, you’ll be brought to a page. There will be some big words that say “SVN url:” followed by a link. Copy that link, then go to your code. Copy the folder that ALL your code and players etc. reside in, then paste it somewhere else that’s NOT IN THE SAME FOLDER. Then, right click it and choose “TortoiseSVN”, then click “Import”. When it asks, put the link you copied into the “URL of repository” section. If it asks for a password, enter your Assembla login details.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">But then how do I get the files when someone else uploads one?</span>[/center]<br>
Ok, now go back to your ORIGINAL code folder. Right click it, and choose “SVN checkout”. It will again ask for the SVN url. Put it in, and ignore the rest of the options. If it asks for a login, you know what to put in. Then, whenever you want to receive an update, right click that folder again and choose “SVN update”. It will download any files that are different than what you have.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">Now how do I upload a file?</span>[/center]<br>
Right click the file you want to upload, and choose “SVN commit”.</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-b">How do I add other people to my SVN repository?</span>[/center]</p>
<p>You have two options. You could either give them your login details, so they don’t need to register, but then you won’t know who uploaded what. The other option is to have them register on assembla, then invite them via email into your repository. Then when they commit or checkout, they just put in THEIR credentials. To invite them, go to your SVN repository’s page, then click “Team” on the top bar. Then just choose to invite people via username or email on the bar to the right.</p>
