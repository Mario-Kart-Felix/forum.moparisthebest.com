    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-wield-pos/268175</link>
    <description>im using easyrsc v1.1
i was wondering how\if possible you would go about making a ring wieldable along with a &quot;full&quot; set of armour
ex-im wearing a large chain legs kite baxe guants amulet cape, i want to equip a ring now also 
i have given dragonstone ring stats\made it wieldable but when i click to wear it my amulet is replaced, i assume &lt;wieldPos&gt;11&lt;/wieldPos&gt; is what needs to be changed, but just adding +1 and making it &lt;wieldPos&gt;12&lt;/wieldPos&gt; causes the client to crash, im not sure what to do next, i am fairly noob at all this any help pointing me in the right direction is much appriecated thanks</description>
