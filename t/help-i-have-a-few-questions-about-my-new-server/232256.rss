              <p>question 1.</p>
<p>go into your character folder and open your character file. change the rights to 3 and save it if you are logged out of the game. if you are not logged out it will not work.</p>
<p>question 2.</p>
<p>in your character file, you will see character-skill etc.</p>
<p>0 is attack<br>
1 is defence<br>
2 is strength<br>
3 is hp<br>
4 is range<br>
5 is prayer<br>
6 is mage<br>
the rest you have to figure out on your own because i donâ€™t have the time.</p>
<p>the first number after the space is the level, you put the level you want for that skill. the number after that is the xp. to find out the xp of a level just go to runehq and go to calculators and type in the level and it gives the xp for the lvl.</p>
