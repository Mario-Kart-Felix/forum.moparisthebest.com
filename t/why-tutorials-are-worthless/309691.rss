    <title>Why tutorials are worthless</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/why-tutorials-are-worthless/309691</link>
    <description>So, here is a conversation I had with &#39;Rich on IRC.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;Ranger_Squad&gt; HEy
&lt;Ranger_Squad&gt; Anyone here that can verify my tut?
&lt;Jorsa&gt; no
&lt;@Rich&gt; yes but no
&lt;Ranger_Squad&gt; Why not, rich?
&lt;@Rich&gt; theres 4 pages of unapproved tutorials waiting
&lt;@Rich&gt; plus iirc we&#39;re just going to let them sit there until we upgrade to 2.0
&lt;Ranger_Squad&gt; Well, can you at least make a fucking effort?
&lt;Ranger_Squad&gt; Why should people spend time writing perfectly good tutorials, when there&#39;s no one going to see them
&lt;Ranger_Squad&gt; ?
&lt;@Rich&gt; cos 99.9% of the tutorials posted are shit
&lt;@Rich&gt; and id decline them all
&lt;@Rich&gt; but we&#39;re removing the filter once 2.0 is released
&lt;Ranger_Squad&gt; Well, can you read my tutorial?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So, if you&#39;re thinking of helping people, go somewhere else.</description>

That also.</p>
<p>I actually meant it in a different way, the key to a good mod is patience, you have to be patient with more ‘nooby’ members of the community to help them, etc etc.<br>
And, gotta be patient if you’re really going for mod, I mean, I never expected myself to become one, came as a complete surprise. But I never went around posting this. :rolleyes:</p>

sorry for the ignorant reply, but it seems i probably read the topic in more detail than you, consiering this topic has nothing worth discussing and if you think, discussing the moderators ability to moderate is discussion… and it’s hardly worth discussing the efficiency of the moderators, they don’t need people like you slowing them down, i think they have enough to deal with than a few crappy tutorails.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with that? You can just submit it when the upgrade is complete. Furthermore:</p>

<p>On the bottom line: Most moderators which are capable of approving tutorial are way too busy. Then whenever they do get the time to make some approvals they are faced with pages of shit which makes it harder to sift out the really good and educational tutorials.</p>

I would not say I was pro at programming however I still moderate. They are both completely different jobs, the opposite in fact. Programming is more orientated towards logic and absolutes while moderating involves assessing situations and making unique decisions.</p>

<p>I’m talking about allowing moderators to approve tutorials on a site based on (shit)programming, when they have little to no experience with a programming language.</p>

<p>Contrary to some people’s belief, it does not take a programmer to make a good moderator.  In fact, many times a good programmer is not a good moderator.  But in the strange case of moderators approving programming tutorials, they must have at least a working knowledge of programming in order to do so.  Therefore there is a limited number moderators that can actually approve the tutorials.</p>

<p>What’s the point of having a moderator who cannot contribute to a community based off of (shit)programming?</p>
