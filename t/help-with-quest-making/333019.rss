    <title>Help with quest making</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-quest-making/333019</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve set up some stuff to work ... however nothing seems to happen when I try to open up the quest help (I have added the code to the client.java)

Also when I set the npc dialogue to make the quest equal 1 (q12 = 1;) nothing happens either ... (quest doesn&#39;t go yellow) and you can&#39;t go onto the next part ...

Evidently I&#39;ve got to add some code somewhere else that saves the quest (yes there is a q12 in the character files)
But i&#39;m not sure what this code is or where it should go (I&#39;ll be able to work out what it is once I found out where it goes)</description>
