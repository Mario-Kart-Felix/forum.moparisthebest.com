    <title>[dev]Minor RSCD_V25 fix</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dev-minor-rscd-v25-fix/226609</link>
    <description>This is a minor fix for rscd_v25 source that i figured out since it was annoying me that my forums were saying that everyone that had gone online at anytime was online even if they were logged off

First:
Go to your unregisterPlayer method (can&#39;t remember the exact file right now)

Second:
at the top of it put [code]try{[/code]

Third:
Right above the [code]players.remove(user);[/code] part put [code]Server.db.updateQuery(&quot;UPDATE `rscd_players` SET loggedin=&#39;&quot; + 0 + &quot;&#39; WHERE user=&quot; + user);[/code]

Fourth:
At the very end put [code]    catch(Exception e) {
        Server.error(e);
      }[/code]

All done this fixes the showing of logged on players on forums even while they aren&#39;t, and also may fix some confusion in codes</description>
