    <title>I&#39;m Back!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-back/232257</link>
    <description>As you guys know, I&#39;m a skilled coder, I&#39;ve recently bought an iPhone and have started coding games, and I&#39;ve forgotten about RS2 Private Servers for a while, and have found out about the new 474 servers and the 508, I&#39;ve been helping momosherilly from Run3Srvr, and we&#39;ve found lots of packets from the 474, but we were just wasting time because of the map data, that&#39;s old now.

I&#39;ve started this thread to inform you guys of a rock solid new server I&#39;m solely creating, my other servers were ahead, but unfortunately they were not stable enough, they could only handle a maximum of 78 players, but I found out a better way to use threads, and I&#39;m working on my server, the client has been completed, it has a pre-built anti-cursing system, has no GameFrame the GameFrame is dumped(dumping is done by the XCDumper), dialogue head visibility and working head-icons.

The server&#39;s framework is divided into each state of instances:
[center]

[ul][li]character[/li]
[li]npc[/li]
[li]object[/li]
[li]graphic[/li]
[li]item[/li]
[li]server[/li]
[li]connection[/li]
[li]packets[/li]
[li]threads[/li][/ul]

[/center]

The utilities included are GUI interfaces created by Java Swing and its components included, I&#39;ve only created about two of these utilities for the server and the developer:

[b]Dialogue Creator: [/b]Creates one, two or three lined dialogues for either a npc or a character, face emotion can be changed too via the utility.

[b]Advanced ControlPanel: [/b]The utility includes multiple dialogues and windows of each button, it includes a command parser (handles commands via the server), all online player messaging, player handler (finds a player and several options are visible for the player either to disconnect, ban, send message, teleport, destroy player or mute), file handler (handles the configurations folder - npc lists, object lists, player lists, item lists and cde lists, can delete a specific item in the file, an in-built file editor and a wizard to complete hard tasks.

That is pretty much my September and November worklist, the server will be release soon.
The server is not completed yet, and might take some time, as I&#39;m creating it by myself..
