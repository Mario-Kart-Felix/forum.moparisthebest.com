    <description>[center]A battle between an old white man and a vicious black man!

*


This shit is real and just recently happened. The African American male showed above was under the influence of LSD. He was then running in public being nude, and attacked/chewed the face off of this old Caucasian male. The cops were called and found them laying on the ground and the black man stripped the old man. The cops demanded the man to get off of him, and he turned and looked at him, growled, and went back to chewing at the mans face. It took 6 gun shots to stop the man and he eventually died. The old man is currently and obviously in critical condition.

<p>EDIT - I see there’s already a thread for this, and as you can see the author put warnings and links in instead of just posting.</p>
