    <title>[Delta/PwnScape] Help with Old 317 Drop System [Non-Renamed]</title>

    <description>[u][b]Description of Problem[/b][/u]
I&#39;m using Pwnscape v1 from about 6 years ago. I have changed/edited almost everything. Slowly fixing everything that doesn&#39;t work. Right now I am attempting to fix the drop system.

[u][b]Server Information[/b][/u]
Server Type: 317 Delta
Version: Pwnscape v1

[u][b]Item Problem[/b][/u]
When a player on the server drops an item, lights a fire, or dies and loses their items. The drop disappears when they leave the area.
(i.e. When you die in wildy, spawn in edgeville, run back to wildy, the items are gone.)
(Example is just for pk, same thing happens when player dies anywhere, not just in wildy)

However, if someone is still in that region the drops are visible. When the player is killed, the player killer can see their items, even when the player returns.
(i.e. Someone kills you, you run up to wildy, you can&#39;t see your stuff, but they still can)
(Example is just for pk, same thing happens when player dies anywhere, not just in wildy)

[u][b]Object Problem[/b][/u]
As for the fire making part of it. When you make a fire, the fire never disappears until you leave the location. This is basically the same issue. When you light a fire, leave the area, and come back, the fire is gone. Users who stay in the area still see the fire, however users that leave and come back, cannot see the fire. (This is an object, not an item, so uses a different method)

[u][b]My Background[/b][/u]
I know how to program Java and Python. I&#39;m going to university for Computer Science with an emphasis on programming, this is my last year. I only have issues programming Runescape. If I knew where to actually look to fix this, I would be able to fix it. If anyone knows anything about this, please reply or contact me via Private Message. 

[u][b]What I need from members of this forum[/b][/u]
Please don&#39;t fix the code for me. I would like to know how to fix it on my own. I only need a description of what I need to do. I would not like any alterations of the code supplied below.

[u][b]Pwnscape Original Code[/b][/u]
createGroundItem() method in client.java
[code]
/* Original Pwnscape Code, (only changed variables to final, since they never change after sent in) */
public void createGroundItem(final int itemID, final int itemX,
			final int itemY, final int itemAmount) {
		// Phate: creates item at absolute X and Y
		outStream.createFrame(85); // Phate: Spawn ground item
		outStream.writeByteC((itemY - 8 * mapRegionY));
		outStream.writeByteC((itemX - 8 * mapRegionX));
		outStream.createFrame(44);
		outStream.writeWordBigEndianA(itemID);
		outStream.writeWord(itemAmount);
		outStream.writeByte(0); // x(4 MSB) y(LSB) coords
		// System.out.println(&quot;CreateGroundItem &quot;+itemID+&quot; &quot;+(itemX - 8 *
		// mapRegionX)+&quot;,&quot;+(itemY - 8 * mapRegionY)+&quot; &quot;+itemAmount);
	}
[/code]

Example of one firemaking aspect:
[code]
/* Original Pwnscape Code, no modifications */
else if ((itemUsed == 1515) &amp;&amp; (useWith == 590)) {
				if (playerLevel[11] &gt;= 60) {
					deleteItem(1515, getItemSlot(1515), 1);
					makeGlobalObject(absX, absY, 2732, 0, 10);
					addSkillXP(780, 11);
					sM(&quot;You attempt to light the logs.&quot;);
					sM(&quot;The fire catches and the logs begin to burn.&quot;);
					resetWC();
				} else {
					sM(&quot;You need a firemaking of 60 to burn yew logs.&quot;);
				}
[/code]
(Note: Did not post all, due to duplicate code and pointlessness);

makeGlobalObject() method in client.java
[code]
/* Original Pwnscape Code, (only changed variables to final, since they never change after sent in) */
public void makeGlobalObject(final int x, final int y, final int typeID,
			final int orientation, final int tileObjectType) { // Makes Global
		// objects
		for (final Player p : server.playerHandler.players) {
			if (p != null) {
				final client person = (client) p;
				if ((person.playerName != null || person.playerName != &quot;null&quot;)) {
					if (person.distanceToPoint(x, y) &lt;= 60) {
						person.createNewTileObject(x, y, typeID, orientation,
								tileObjectType);
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
[/code]

createNewTileObject() method in client.java
[code]
/* Original Pwnscape Code, (only changed variables to final, since they never change after sent in) */
	public void createNewTileObject(final int x, final int y, final int typeID) {
		final boolean a = true;
		if (a)
			return;
		outStream.createFrame(85);
		outStream.writeByteC(y - (mapRegionY * 8));
		outStream.writeByteC(x - (mapRegionX * 8));
		outStream.createFrame(151);
		// outStream.writeByteA(((x&amp;7) &lt;&lt; 4) + (y&amp;7));
		outStream.writeByteA(0);
		outStream.writeWordBigEndian(typeID);
	}
[/code]
