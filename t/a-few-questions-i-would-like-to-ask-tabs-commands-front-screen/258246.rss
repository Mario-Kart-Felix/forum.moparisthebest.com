    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-questions-i-would-like-to-ask-tabs-commands-front-screen/258246</link>
    <description>first, i would like to ask where do i make more tabs or delete some where the emotes are normally??

second, how do you get rid of that front screen on some sources when u login.?

third, i would like someone to reply to this or pm me about which i need to put:

[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;pickup&quot;)[/code]

[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;starter&quot;)) {[/code]

[code]|| playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;name&quot;))) {[/code]

i would like someone to explain to me what these mean, and which i need to put to make a command.</description>

              <p>so, if i wanted to delete the “home” tab, i would delete the whole of case 168 then compile?</p>
<p>if i wanted to make one would i need to make a command then add the command name into the command space?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 24, 2009, 04:09:09 pm[/size][hr]thank you chassy.</p>
<p>and i meant:</p>
<p><code>if (command.startsWith("eat")</code> - their are commands that start with this.</p>
<p><code>if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("pure")</code> - this.</p>
<p><code>else if (command.startsWith("makemem") &amp;&amp; (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("name")</code> - and this.</p>
<p>i meant that all commands start with one of these and i was wondering which one i would need to do to make the command i want to make.</p>
<p>anyone tell me, thanks.</p>
<p>kickingjamie, the first part helped me but if i was going to delete the case, would i need to delete all of it and compile??</p>
<p>the second part - i didnt actually mean what you put but thanks…<br>
i already had the commands but i was just wondering what the first part ments and which i need to put to start my command ^above.</p>

              <p>Second: Under your initialize method, you will have something that loads a method. Something like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">newWelc();</code></pre>
<p>Delete the method or change it, or just delete the calling of the method from your initialize method.</p>
<p>I am not sure what you mean by number 3, but if you want to know what this means:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">|| playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("name") </code></pre>
<p>then the ‘||’ is a logical operator. || means OR, so if you have something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(command.equals("master") &amp;&amp; playerRights == 3 || playerName.equalsIgnoreCase("namehere")) {</code></pre>
<p>That would mean that any players with the rights of 3 could do the master command, or if someone had the name ‘namehere’ then they could also do it.</p>
<p>Here is a great page to learn about Relational and Logical Operators, and much much more helpful information:</p>

              <p>i can help with the tabs it really simple heres how to change what they do…::</p>
<p>when you right click the emote tabs there are numbers these are cases… then find the one you want to change and search this in client.java   case 168:<br>
you should see somthing like this</p>
<p><code>            case 168:
                if (teleblock == true) { // Made by Mod Allstar
                    sendMessage("A magical force stops you from teleporting."); 
                } else {
                    customCommand("WHERE THE COMMAND TAKES YOU"); // made by Mod Allstar
                }
                break;</code></p>
<p>now change this part to the command you want it to do (“your command here”);  if you wanted to change the one next to this then you would find the case id of it and instead of searching for case 168: you would search for case (case number):[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 24, 2009, 11:42:38 am[/size][hr]the commands are also easy to use heres how…im going to help you with the pickup up command…</p>
<p>[code]        }</p>
<pre><code>    if (command.startsWith("pickup") &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 2)) {
        try {
            int newItemID = Integer.parseInt(command.substring(7, 12));
            int newItemAmount = Integer.parseInt(command.substring(13));

            if (newItemID &lt;= 30000 &amp;&amp; newItemID &gt;= 0) {
                addItem(newItemID, newItemAmount);
            } else {
                sendMessage("That Item Doesn't Exist");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            sendMessage("You suck at spawning. Do it again ! ");[/code]
</code></pre>
<p>that would complete your pickup command to make a teleporting command it would look somthing like this ::</p>
<p><code>            }
        } else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("command name")) {
            if (teleblock == true) {
                sendMessage("A magical force stops you from teleporting."); // made by Mod Allstar
            } else {
                teleportToX = change these to x coords of tele;
                teleportToY = change these to y coords of tele;
                sendMessage("message send after you do the command.");</code></p>
<p>also you can make commands give you items like so::</p>
<p><code>        if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("command name")) {
            addItem(item id, amount);
            sendMessage("message sent"); </code></p>
<p>i hope i helped you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
