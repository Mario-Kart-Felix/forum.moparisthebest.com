    <title>HDD Trouble</title>

    <description>Hi, there.

Last week, I was using my laptop downstairs, closed the lid, ran upstairs, opened it, click the mouse, the blue stop error screen flashed real quick, and the laptop was off. Upon rebooting, I found the &quot;No Operating System Found&quot; error. I then proceeded to pop in my Windows XP disc. After everything loaded, the setup told me it could find no hard drive on my system.

So, yesterday, I got an external case for my drive, plugged the puppy in, got some stuff off it onto my PC, reformatted it, ran the error-checking tool, which returned with no errors, put it back into the laptop and BIOS detected no hard drive. 

I then tried to use the external case to install Windows , which was successful, up until the part where setup rebooted, which gave me another blue stop error screen saying &quot;Check your computer for viruses, run CHKDSK /F to search for bad sectors&quot;. Did that, retried, same results.

So, I am guessing it is a either:

a.) Bad seating in laptop hard drive bay.
b.) Bad hard drive.
c.) God&#39;s wrath.
d.) Can&#39;t think of anything else.

I took it to the local computer repair shop, who said the OS just crashed and charged me $35 :rolleyes:

I&#39;ve tried various drive diagnostics tools, which haven&#39;t seemed to help. 

Any ideas, please?</description>
