    <title>Help is needed, :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-is-needed/5908</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just got done editing all my magics so that they actully look right (Took awhile :P)

Anyways, I was wondering how I can add the effect of the whip when you run with it, attk with it, walk with it, etc...I have the emote numbers and everything but I&#39;m not sure how. It would be greatly appreciated because I was also wondering how to do it to all weapons like Dharok&#39;s Axe, etc...

And also how I can make the flail, x-bow, staff/spears, stand right too. :P

And last but not least (Answer this last because it&#39;s not as important) how I can make my NPCs attack with their style like Guthan for instance. He attacks nothing like he should.

Thanks abunch.  :)</description>
