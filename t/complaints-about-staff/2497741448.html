        <p>Yeah… Most of the part during the day there’s no moderators on and the server help section gets slammed with retarded topics that requires common sense to solve. Other than the mods being a little inactive, they know exactly what they’re doing. Obviously, the moderators here weren’t just randomly picked. They had reasons on choosing them. To the people that hate the mods because they lock your topics for no reason you say, you guys just don’t understand what these forums are really about yet. I’ll admit, I’m a smartass sometimes to people but that’s only because 90% of the topics in the server help section are stupid and only require a brain with common sense to solve. The longer you’re here, the more you’ll understand this place. That’s how it was for me.</p>

<p>through out the day, lots of others are at school which means there shouldnt be as much common sence threads.<br>
im pritty sure, every1 here goes to collage or school and so they are not always on in the afternoons/mornings.</p>
<p>some threads are really common sence, thats why others dont bover posting on them, because they make themselfs look really stupid. lots of others are just pure lazy not reading tuts ect…</p>
<p>threads are locked in server help because people argue, they arn’t nice or its common sence and you would get an answer by reading through the sections/ searching.</p>
<p>some threads are in the middle. today someone asked “how can i connect with my no-ip like all the other players” or something and lots of people argue that you can or cant login with your no-ip only 0.0.0.0. but others say they can login with both (like me)… thats the topics where its in the middle and could get locked.</p>

<p>True, but at times there is also NO staff members on at all. A lot of threads don’t get locked and gravedigging is getting worse every day. Shouldn’t younger staff members be also selected? I realize there are some already, but qwerty does have a point. Some staff members are becoming less active.</p>

<p>The Staff team is designed to be on almost every point of the day. There is usually at least one moparscape moderator on. The globals pop in now and then, as do the administrators. There are very few points in the day that actually don’t have staff members online, and those are obviously the points at which someone would wish to attack the site. But I highly doubt there is any period in the day that there are no staff members on for longer than 30 minutes, which is not very long at all. Any events that could possibly happen can easily be cleaned up by a staff member who will be on shortly after the event has taken place.</p>
<p>As for suggestion future moderators, leave that to the staff team. If we feel we cannot cope with the amount of work Moparscape takes to manage it, then we will suggest future mods to our fellow staff members. If the globals and admins agree, then the person will be tried as a moderator. Your suggestions do nothing to influence the choosing of future moderators. We have our own ways of selecting moderators out of the several thousand members here and then monitoring them to decide whether they can handle the position.</p>
<p>And about the age thing, I personally disagree with letting someone younger than thirteen be a moderator here. In fact, I don’t like the idea of even a thirteen year old holding a position, but I started off at that age myself, so it would be hypocritical of me to disagree. There have been past experiences with younger moderators who we thought were mature enough for the position, yet ended up making a fool of themselves and of this community. The generally popular people of this community also happen to be younger, which makes it a very bad combination. The community will thrust suggestions of these popular people to become staff members, but they generally do not qualify due to their age (which is not a requirement, but moreover a convenience) or their impressions they leave upon us.</p>
<p>The one thing that will certainly break my own vote for a future staff member is whether they show they want the position. If a person wants a staff position and enjoys the attention the community is giving them for whatever they are being recognized for, then I believe they will become power hungry and end up abusing their position, which I do not want to see happen. However, on the opposite side of the spectrum, neither would I vote for someone who absolutely doesn’t want the position. The type of person who is ideal for moderator in my mind is the one who accepts the position, perhaps with minute want, but with no wanting prior to the offer and no lack of wanting after.</p>
<p>And finally, a devotion and positive attitude toward the community means everything. Also the adaption to other staff members and an open mind to suggestions and changes.</p>

<p>I can agree that some people under 13 can’t be trusted as much, but you really can’t know until a trial. Of course, I pretty much agree with everything you just wrote. There sometimes are points in the day where there isn’t a staff member online, but as you said it isn’t for more than 30 minutes that happens.</p>
<p>I also agree with the power-hungry thing. I would think that if you <span class="bbcode-b">want</span> moderator, you just want the power to lock a thread and moderate or warn people. If you don’t want it and are given it, I think you would basically remain just wanting to help out the community more than destroy it.</p>
<p>Once again, that was some helpful information. I hope to see a nice choice of new staff later on.</p>

<p>I guess this isn’t very relevant to what you’re talking about, but how come Global Moderators are called ‘Global’, as they only moderate Moparisthebest. You might as well have called them MITB Moderators. If they’re global moderators, then they should be moderating both forums, am I right?</p>

<p>The Staff team is designed to be on almost every point of the day. There is usually at least one moparscape moderator on. The globals pop in now and then, as do the administrators. There are very few points in the day that actually don’t have staff members online, and those are obviously the points at which someone would wish to attack the site. But I highly doubt there is any period in the day that there are no staff members on for longer than 30 minutes, which is not very long at all. Any events that could possibly happen can easily be cleaned up by a staff member who will be on shortly after the event has taken place.<br>

<p>I guess this isn’t very relevant to what you’re talking about, but how come Global Moderators are called ‘Global’, as they only moderate Moparisthebest. You might as well have called them MITB Moderators. If they’re global moderators, then they should be moderating both forums, am I right?[/quote]Soul as i seen most of the Global moderators pop in here and on MITB</p>

<p>I can agree that some people under 13 can’t be trusted as much, but you really can’t know until a trial. Of course, I pretty much agree with everything you just wrote. There sometimes are points in the day where there isn’t a staff member online, but as you said it isn’t for more than 30 minutes that happens.</p>
<p>I also agree with the power-hungry thing. I would think that if you <span class="bbcode-b">want</span> moderator, you just want the power to lock a thread and moderate or warn people. If you don’t want it and are given it, I think you would basically remain just wanting to help out the community more than destroy it.</p>
<p>Once again, that was some helpful information. I hope to see a nice choice of new staff later on.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not exactly a trust issue. An obvious requirement to any staff position in any job would certainly be trust. The problem with giving younger people power is that it usually gets to their head and they are generally not mature enough to handle certain events and criticism they receive. Negative criticism leads to low self-esteem and positive leads to arrogance. Its extreme in both cases which is why I am against younger staff members. Though some definitely prove more than mature enough to handle the position, despite their age.</p>

<p>I mean, I can understand not giving a say…10 year old a staff spot. But once you hit 12-13+, you mature a little bit. But you can’t really know if they are mature enough with a moderator status unless they get a trial, am I correct?</p>

<p>Not necessarily. How they deal in everyday situations here on the forum as a normal user reflects how they would act as a moderator. People change, nevertheless, but they still need to be mature before having the position instead of only after.</p>
