xxlukexx, you broke a rule more inclusively than the people who were not necessarily warned. The rules are interpreted and administered via the eyes of the moderator. I read the topic with the impression that you were the only one who was posting something entirely useless that could have been left better unsaid. Sure, chassy flamed him a little, but not nearly enough to land him a warning. You were the only one who broke a rule extensively enough to be punished for it, other than the topic creator of course.<br>

<p>lots of people comment/post onto rediculus threads that are not needed.<br>
just like the one i got a warning off. the topic owners make themselfs look really stupid. i mean, they cannot even post into the right section?? it should of been in the runescape section, not the server help or tut section.<br>
“how to make money” isnt really teaching us something or isnt related to a server. yeah, runescape is a kind of server but not in morpar ways. i just find people post pathetic threads and other people get blamed and get punished for no reason and the topic owner doesn’t.[/quote]</p>

the owner of the thread also was a spam.[/quote]<br>
No, it doesnt matter that the original post was spam or not: You broke a rule you get punished! Second of al it doesnt matter what its “related” to you still did something wrong and you think that you didnt deserve it.<br>
Worst of all you bumped a topic that shoud not have any posts in the first place. If there is a stupid thread you dont post on it because it draws more attention and makes the spammer happy. What you supposed to do is use the “Report to Moderator” link and report the post.<br>
Finally other stupid people are not warned simply because a member of staff either hasn’t seen the post. We are just lucky that a moderator did see your post and warned.</p>

<p>as i can tell you, taharok is a horrible mod. gives me moderated for saying “gtfo, we dont want you here” because they wanted a personal coder.</p>
<p>well taharok, go look around the section and see what you find up. i gurantee there will be plenty more others asking for coders and mods have said “no this isnt aloud here”.</p>
<p>nice abuse.</p>

<p>dude, im not actually complaining about m.dog. he actually is a nice mod who locks threads for reasons and warns other to stop or they are warned.</p>
<p>taharok, on the other hand, just abuses like someone duping on another server. they do wrong.<br>
the first things a new player should do, is read the rules befor posting…<br>
normally alot of these thread owners who make threads like that are not even new so what are you on about??<br>
he gave me moderated for a stupid reason and didnt give others?? how pathetic.</p>

<p>I’m getting sick of his attitude that if everything does not go his way then it’s shit. As far as I’m concerned, he can just get off this forum right now. No one wants him here as he is clearly not doing anything to benefit this community. If this topic is complaints about staff then it should surely be complains about users from the staff standpoint.</p>

Actually I moderated 2-3 people in that topic, muted one, and warned another xxlukexx, but obviously you did not realize that. I just recently banned someone for two weeks for having an attitude similar to yours. I really don’t care if you rant at me, but you are publicizing this and you are making yourself look like more of an idiot. If you continue, I will not hesitate to ban you temporarily for your disgusting attitude.</p>
<p>And on that note, did you really have to go from calling me a bad mod for warning you to an abusing mod for moderating you? What will you do if I mute you? Will you evade it and start flaming the sections like all the past whiny teenage pricks just like you? Honestly, grow some balls and stop whining. If you do not want to get punished then <span class="bbcode-b">don’t break the damn rules</span>.<br>

<p>I’m getting sick of his attitude that if everything does not go his way then it’s shit. As far as I’m concerned, he can just get off this forum right now. No one wants him here as he is clearly not doing anything to benefit this community. If this topic is complaints about staff then it should surely be complains about users from the staff standpoint.</p>

<p>thats right, no one wants me here, thats because no one knows me, like the rest of the others INCLUDING you.<br>

<p>You’re right, this is to help the staff to improve their current way of moderating. Throughout the thread there’s various examples on people that are simply acting upon their infractions or threads’ locked, though that isn’t the case and they seem like they’re just angry and have to single one moderator out for the cause; though the moderator is only doing their responsibility.</p>

<p>I can understand that, but shouldn’t it be important how active a moderator is? What is the point of having a staff member that is rarely active? Although, you can’t really stop people from having important events in their lives.</p>
