    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/complaints-about-staff/249774</link>
    <description>This topic has been made to replace the previous topic (which was removed because it was being misused).

The rules are simple: This topic is for complaints about staff conduct. In other words, if you think a staff member has unfairly warned you then post here.

This topic is not for complaining about moderator choices.

Reminder: This isn&#39;t for staff praise, either. Don&#39;t post things like &quot;Oh, I love [insert moderator here], he&#39;s so cool!&quot;. We&#39;re asking for complaints, and posting praise isn&#39;t going to help.

Second Reminder: This thread is [b]NOT[/b] for controversy with other members [b]OR[/b] personal issues with your account. This was stuck so that you would all stop making staff complain threads in sections they didn&#39;t belong. You&#39;re here to complain about the staff not cooperating, their lack of effort, abuse of power, bad judgment, etc. Please try to keep to the topic.</description>

<p>If you have any genuine complaints (ie, you make a post that’s actually intelligent and someone mutes you for the next decade) then message an administrator or global mod.<br>
Don’t message us about ridiculous things, especially if you were in the wrong, because we’ll either ignore it completely (if you’re lucky) or we’ll punish you further.</p>
