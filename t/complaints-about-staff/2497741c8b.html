<p>some threads are patheticly stupid and common sence, people post to say they are lazy and then they get a warning…<br>
its very stupid… even though the thread is stupid and the comments are stupid the people who post the comments get a fuckin warning… its out of order.</p>
<p>why should the posters get a warning for saying common sence or UMM or something when the thread is something about rs.</p>
<p>some mods just say right, ur on a warning for spamming, some actually give you a warning then you get a warning if it happens again. if all staff was like that then it would be a better comunity.</p>
<p>they mute, moderated, warn people every day for very stupid reasons.</p>

<p>You’re right but have you ever taken a step back and looked at it? Ok, this is just one example of a bad thread. When people ask about port forwarding. Now, how many times a day do you see that in the Server Help section? I think a countless number of times. Now, if you look around and see how many different resources people like this have you will realize how stupid the thread is, how it’s considered spam, and why they should get warned. Examples for resources would be: <a href="http://www.portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a> , Google (tutorials on Google.), and there’s even a sticky in the Server Tutorials section by The Soul. I mean, this wouldn’t be an example of needing to encourage them, this just shows extreme lazyness and really not wanting to do anything about their problem. Now I understand from their perspective that they just want to come in here, and get their problem out of the way, and by doing that they don’t read the rules. Well compare it to reality. If somebody gets murdered and they say they didn’t know the law are they still going to get punished? If we don’t stop, or punish, the murderer then he will just keep murdering. Stopping the murderer and letting him know why he’s being arrested will then still encourage him to not do it again. I mean, doesn’t this really make sense? Not only that but it will help clear up so much clutter and spam on the forums. Threads like that usually lead to people saying “Don’t be lazy, do it yourself.” which then leads to another person saying “He just needs help so shut up.” which will then lead into a fight and contribute EVEN MORE spam and flame to the forums. Eliminating the source will stop it from going. Put out the fire before it gets bigger.</p>

I’m not trying to put you on the spot or anything, because you’ve made pretty good points, but that’s far from the same concept. People actually tried to compare this to things similar to murder a number of times, and that’s when the conversation reaches it’s peak. Members that make ignorant posts without referring to the rules prior to their posts deserve punishment logically. But as Taharok said, we would be driving the members away. Brand new members that come to moparscape see the forum as a source of help and aid, and by nearly automatically slapping them with something they didn’t even realize would happen, it would disappoint them, forcing them to think low of this “oh-so helpful source of help”. As members proceed and become more connected to the community they’re bound to realize the effects they have on the community by posting garbage. It’s the mods roll to guide them into becoming “logical” members, rather than scolding them as soon as they arrive. There’s always more than one thing to take into account.</p>

<p>I think they’re not warning enough… I think anyone who asks stupid common sense questions, such as port forwarding help, asking stuff like “can someone make me a server”, “can someone make me a shop”, and other stupid topics like that that break the rules should get a warning. This is how it always plays out. Usually a Moderator would come in, say “We don’t help with port forwarding here.”, locks the topic, then that’s it. What’s the point in that? Don’t you realize they are breaking a rule that is clearly stated and explained in the section rules? And 90% of the those people are first time posters… Think about this. Someone who completely sucks at coding waltzes on in here, which by the way, they shouldn’t even be here if they don’t know a thing about coding, they post a rule-breaking topic because they are a first time poster and it never crossed their mind to read the rules, and they never get warned? That’s stupid, then they double post, make multiple threads, and keep making those same retarded, pointless threads in the future. I understand why spammers and flamers get warned. I 100% back that up and support it, but why not first time posters that come in here and could care less to read the rules? Where it shows the reason you got warned it should say “Read the rules.”, or whatever their offense is.</p>

<p>Though I half agree with you, you also need to look at it from the point of view of a newcomer. This site is for those who wish to start out creating private servers as much as it is for those who already know quite a bit about them. Handing out solid warnings to people who don’t follow this section’s rules down to the minute details will discourage and shun that person from this community. We really don’t want that. Our job is not just to police the people on here, but also to encourage them and act as civil, normal members.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re right but have you ever taken a step back and looked at it? Ok, this is just one example of a bad thread. When people ask about port forwarding. Now, how many times a day do you see that in the Server Help section? I think a countless number of times. Now, if you look around and see how many different resources people like this have you will realize how stupid the thread is, how it’s considered spam, and why they should get warned. Examples for resources would be: <a href="http://www.portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a> , Google (tutorials on Google.), and there’s even a sticky in the Server Tutorials section by The Soul. I mean, this wouldn’t be an example of needing to encourage them, this just shows extreme lazyness and really not wanting to do anything about their problem. Now I understand from their perspective that they just want to come in here, and get their problem out of the way, and by doing that they don’t read the rules. Well compare it to reality. If somebody gets murdered and they say they didn’t know the law are they still going to get punished? If we don’t stop, or punish, the murderer then he will just keep murdering. Stopping the murderer and letting him know why he’s being arrested will then still encourage him to not do it again. I mean, doesn’t this really make sense? Not only that but it will help clear up so much clutter and spam on the forums. Threads like that usually lead to people saying “Don’t be lazy, do it yourself.” which then leads to another person saying “He just needs help so shut up.” which will then lead into a fight and contribute EVEN MORE spam and flame to the forums. Eliminating the source will stop it from going. Put out the fire before it gets bigger.<br>
[/quote]I noticed you used the “murder” concept to contrast a RSPS forum. I’m not trying to put you on the spot or anything, because you’ve made pretty good points, but that’s far from the same concept. People actually tried to compare this to things similar to murder a number of times, and that’s when the conversation reaches it’s peak. Members that make ignorant posts without referring to the rules prior to their posts deserve punishment logically. But as Taharok said, we would be driving the members away. Brand new members that come to moparscape see the forum as a source of help and aid, and by nearly automatically slapping them with something they didn’t even realize would happen, it would disappoint them, forcing them to think low of this “oh-so helpful source of help”. As members proceed and become more connected to the community they’re bound to realize the effects they have on the community by posting garbage. It’s the mods roll to guide them into becoming “logical” members, rather than scolding them as soon as they arrive. There’s always more than one thing to take into account.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright, yeah, you guys are right. But it’s still ridiculous on the amount of threads there are that really don’t have a point on being there. Maybe not warning them the first time but I think something has to be done because there’s a fight on like every thread in the help section. I don’t know, I may have raised some good points I may not have but something needs to be done and maybe something can without punishing people.</p>

<p>How about global mods that have been around before this website was created? They didn’t take the job knowing they would have to moderate this forum.</p>
<p>You want to know why <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> was created? Because when the private server boards were at MITB, the forum turned into a complete <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> hole, just like this site. <a href="http://moparscape.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> was created to remove the <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> from MITB. So that’s all this community is, a big giant <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> hole. That’s why gmod’s are active at MITB but not here. We do however come by to do post reports and check up on things. We don’t want this stuff at our site because we are not a community of raging little kids.</p>
<p>I’m not part of this community, it makes it hard to moderate this place because I don’t know how things are supposed to go here. Unfortunately there’s very few people active at both mitb and moparscape who would be deserving of a global mod position. Actually, there’s pretty much no one imo other then some current mods.</p>

What you said was true Taharok, but weren’t all of those posts in the past? Now that they’re Global Moderators they spend most of their time dwelling at Moparisthebest.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>How about global mods that have been around before this website was created? They didn’t take the job knowing they would have to moderate this forum.</p>
<p>You want to know why <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> was created? Because when the private server boards were at MITB, the forum turned into a complete <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> hole, just like this site. <a href="http://moparscape.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> was created to remove the <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> from MITB. So that’s all this community is, a big giant <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> hole. That’s why gmod’s are active at MITB but not here. We do however come by to do post reports and check up on things. We don’t want this stuff at our site because we are not a community of raging little kids.</p>
<p>I’m not part of this community, it makes it hard to moderate this place because I don’t know how things are supposed to go here. Unfortunately there’s very few people active at both mitb and moparscape who would be deserving of a global mod position. Actually, there’s pretty much no one imo other then some current mods.</p>

<p>Though I half agree with you, you also need to look at it from the point of view of a newcomer. This site is for those who wish to start out creating private servers as much as it is for those who already know quite a bit about them. Handing out solid warnings to people who don’t follow this section’s rules down to the minute details will discourage and shun that person from this community. We really don’t want that. Our job is not just to police the people on here, but also to encourage them and act as civil, normal members.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re right but have you ever taken a step back and looked at it? Ok, this is just one example of a bad thread. When people ask about port forwarding. Now, how many times a day do you see that in the Server Help section? I think a countless number of times. Now, if you look around and see how many different resources people like this have you will realize how stupid the thread is, how it’s considered spam, and why they should get warned. Examples for resources would be: <a href="http://www.portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">www.portforward.com</a> , Google (tutorials on Google.), and there’s even a sticky in the Server Tutorials section by The Soul. I mean, this wouldn’t be an example of needing to encourage them, this just shows extreme lazyness and really not wanting to do anything about their problem. Now I understand from their perspective that they just want to come in here, and get their problem out of the way, and by doing that they don’t read the rules. Well compare it to reality. If somebody gets murdered and they say they didn’t know the law are they still going to get punished? If we don’t stop, or punish, the murderer then he will just keep murdering. Stopping the murderer and letting him know why he’s being arrested will then still encourage him to not do it again. I mean, doesn’t this really make sense? Not only that but it will help clear up so much clutter and spam on the forums. Threads like that usually lead to people saying “Don’t be lazy, do it yourself.” which then leads to another person saying “He just needs help so shut up.” which will then lead into a fight and contribute EVEN MORE spam and flame to the forums. Eliminating the source will stop it from going. Put out the fire before it gets bigger.[/quote]</p>
<p>Naturally, someone would compare this site to some real life instance or situation. This is not real life-- it is the internet. Serious business, sure, but it remains a small thing in our everyday lives. This site is no more than a discussion of RuneScape  Private Servers and a place where the majority of the memberbase wants some sort of fame.</p>
<p>But besides that, I am basing my opinions on the fact that I have been here for quite a long time. I have seen this community go from its early ‘glory’ days to its darkest, shitty days. I then saw it become revolutionary and then loose most of its members. I then saw it be reformed into what it is today.</p>
<p>This site is in a state where it needs to be rebuilt now that it has been stripped of the negative members. Do you really think it is a good idea to start rebuilding a website with the immediate actions of denying someone help? I personally do not. Most of my few friends that came from Moparscape are people who started off as total idiots, but learned as they grew. There are few of us who actually started off as independent workers and rarely asked questions. But for the others, doing what you said wold simply drive them away and destroy more of this reconstructed site. With this in mind, I refuse to punish someone who asks a question that breaks the rules, unless they have been an intentional nuisance.</p>

<p>Don’t drop the soap boys. I must ask why you make this topic, if someone complains about a moderator, the moderator just removes there post and mutes them? I have no complaints about staff.</p>

<p>They get warned because they don’t need to cuss and spam in every message they post about the staff.</p>

</aside>
<p>some threads are patheticly stupid and common sence, people post to say they are lazy and then they get a warning…<br>
its very stupid… even though the thread is stupid and the comments are stupid the people who post the comments get a fuckin warning… its out of order.</p>
<p>why should the posters get a warning for saying common sence or UMM or something when the thread is something about rs.</p>
<p>some mods just say right, ur on a warning for spamming, some actually give you a warning then you get a warning if it happens again. if all staff was like that then it would be a better comunity.</p>
<p>they mute, moderated, warn people every day for very stupid reasons.</p>

<p>Could you please give me some instances of us warning/moderating/muting people for very stupid reasons?[/quote]</p>
<p>ok, well this thread i got a warning off you.</p>

<p>personally, i think i did wrong/nothing wrong.<br>
yes i spammed a little but as i said, its nothing to do with morpar related just runescape.<br>
the owner of the thread also was a spam.</p>
<p>if you look at many of the other threads around the site, then you would see plenty of spam and they dont get a warning??</p>

What you said was true Taharok, but weren’t all of those posts in the past? Now that they’re Global Moderators they spend most of their time dwelling at Moparisthebest.</p>

</aside>
<p>How about global mods that have been around before this website was created? They didn’t take the job knowing they would have to moderate this forum.</p>
<p>You want to know why <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" rel="nofollow noopener">moparisthebest.com/smf</a> was created? Because when the private server boards were at MITB, the forum turned into a complete <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> hole, just like this site. <a href="http://moparscape.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Moparscape.org</a> was created to remove the <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> from MITB. So that’s all this community is, a big giant <span class="bbcode-b">shit</span> hole. That’s why gmod’s are active at MITB but not here. We do however come by to do post reports and check up on things. We don’t want this stuff at our site because we are not a community of raging little kids.</p>
<p>I’m not part of this community, it makes it hard to moderate this place because I don’t know how things are supposed to go here. Unfortunately there’s very few people active at both mitb and moparscape who would be deserving of a global mod position. Actually, there’s pretty much no one imo other then some current mods.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because you can complain about the staff, without screaming like a <span class="bbcode-b">child</span>. Calling someone a faggot is not a complaint, it’s an attack. If you can’t see why they were warned, you’re part of the problem.</p>
<p>My opinions don’t necessarily reflect the opinions of other staff members.[/quote]</p>
<p>some mods just lock without even giving a reason, even in the <span class="bbcode-b">server help</span> section and its server related.<br>
they also warn others for rediculus reasons when there are plenty of other threads that have spam on and havn’t been warned or something.<br>
it is quite unfair.</p>

        <p>xxlukexx, you broke a rule more inclusively than the people who were not necessarily warned. The rules are interpreted and administered via the eyes of the moderator. I read the topic with the impression that you were the only one who was posting something entirely useless that could have been left better unsaid. Sure, chassy flamed him a little, but not nearly enough to land him a warning. You were the only one who broke a rule extensively enough to be punished for it, other than the topic creator of course.</p>

        <p>lots of people comment/post onto rediculus threads that are not needed.<br>
just like the one i got a warning off. the topic owners make themselfs look really stupid. i mean, they cannot even post into the right section?? it should of been in the runescape section, not the server help or tut section.<br>
“how to make money” isnt really teaching us something or isnt related to a server. yeah, runescape is a kind of server but not in morpar ways. i just find people post pathetic threads and other people get blamed and get punished for no reason and the topic owner doesn’t.</p>
