Yes, such as them. To be honest, I don’t recall seeing any of the people you named actually do a moderation job. I have seen them online, but that is all. _Vengeance isn’t all that active moderating either, nor Benz. They may have things going on in real life that they can’t help, but they aren’t really playing the full role in their position. There is probably an understandable exception to that, but they shouldn’t have moderator in my opinion if they can’t be using the full force of it. I like the mods, but they are supposed to be here locking topics and keeping the forum spam-clean imo. I see Taharok, m.dog, and sometimes jme lock a topic everyday.</p>

<p>To be honest, I have thought this for awhile also. Even if you drop in from time to time, that really isn’t playing the full role in your position. Why be a moderator when you are rarely using the abilities of it? I don’t have anything against the moderators, but why should they deserve a role if they aren’t using it 85% of the time? That is like getting a part in a play, but not showing up for practices.[/quote]Overall: if you’ve been specifically chosen to do something, yet you’re not here to do it, what’s the point? It’s just disappointing to know that there are members with moderator abilities, and there are other moderators that are incredibly active and hold perhaps their position as well as the non active mod’s position in “quota” if you will.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking, and I’ve realized the ratio of active mods to inactive mods pertaining to MoparScape is fairly uneven. If you take a look at moderators on MITB, you’ll notice that there’s a fair lot of them active. If you compare that to staff pick over at MoparScape, it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. The only excuse I’ve heard in giving out new mod positions to active members on MoparScape is because they aren’t “mature” enough, they’ll take the power for granted, or they’ll somehow give mscp a bad name by doing something erratically unacceptale as a moderator. If you’re unsure, then i don’t see how much damage a new mod could do to moparscape with a week or so in the position. What I’m saying is, have you ever thought about giving the mod positions to members and seeing if they can hold the position to your expectations? You’d never know unless you gave it a shot; if you don’t approve of what they become after getting their position, it’s that easy to just demote them.</p>

<p>That’s true, just because they’re moderators why does that give them the right to be absent for months straight and come and go as they please? Now, I understand from their perspective that they probably have good reasons for being absent, most of them at least, but why does months being absent excuse them? They took responsibilities and they should tend to them consistently. If you take a job, or get promoted, and you don’t go to work for months, what happens to the person? They get fired. Now all I’m saying is if they’re absent for like 2-3 months then they should be demoted. Depending on how well of a moderator they were should affect their ways of being promoted again upon their return.</p>

        <p>It’s not like there’s a set number though on available staff positions.

<p>I do think we need more moparscape mods at the moment. Just because I’m the only mod online doesn’t mean I want to go through an hour of post reports and watch every thread like a hawk.</p>

<p>Well, the main reason I brought this up was referring to the server help section. I see rule-breaking topics slipping past the mods when “they aren’t looking”, you could say. I don’t know why this bugs me, but just the fact that someone could make a topic and another person could make a topic about the same problem and only one of those two people would get their topic locked. It’s not really fair to the person with the locked topic because the other person didn’t get their topic locked because a moderator didn’t see it, due to some inactivity. And it’s like, they would say to themself “Well, that guy didn’t get his thread locked so why did I?” Its like, time to time a moderator would come by, lock a couple of topics, and be on their way. And it’s like, well in about 5 more minutes there’s going to be even more rule-breaking topics. I understand that a moderator can’t just sit there all day and lock topics, but if like 4 moderators did a little bit at each time together then it would help the server help section consistently and not just for maybe 20 minutes and then there’s like 3 hour gaps where you don’t see a mod. Now don’t get me wrong, I respect each and every moderator and admin… But I guess what I’m trying to say is attempt to clean out the mod section (and I will say no names on who) OR possibly bring new moderators to this community.</p>

<p>To be honest, there is never a time in the day where NO moderator or admin is online for more than 30 minutes. A lot of them hang out on MITB, and not here.

<p>Don’t forget that the mods are around 300-500(?) reported topics behind. Taharok told me they are around that many, and no one wants to do them, so they just browse the recent topics for locking. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing unless gravedigging gets way out of hand(which is starting). I think the Mods are smart enough to decide new MoparScape Moderators when needed, although the community is getting worse in ways, I think the Mods will eventually get it under control. It will be hard to get it under control as there is an average of 324 new members per day.</p>

        <p>Well i’ll address a few of the problems that you have presented to us. Firstly, moderator’s are chosen through a suggestion system. If a staff member happens to see another member doing an excellent job then that staff member will suggest the individual to the rest of us. We then conduct a vote and monitor his activity and posts for around a week. If the candidate is suitable then we will make a decision as to what we will do with them. It’s rather common for us to wait a month or two to check for consistency. Hopefully that will answer that question.</p>
<p>Secondly, majority of us moderators know when our times has expired. If we get too busy or we notice our activity drop then we make the decision to quit most of the time. The more manpower the better. That’s the way we view it.</p>
<p>Last but not least, reports are not too far behind. We do miss a few but we find it more efficient if we just make strong examples of the worst cases. Hopefully people will learn by looking at them and seeing the actions that we do take.</p>
<p>That’s as much as i can say in regards to recruitment and all of that garbage.</p>

<p>That’s as much as i can say in regards to recruitment and all of that garbage.[/quote]All of this is totally true, and I agree 100%. But with situations going as they have been for the past few weeks, we could use a little bit more help over here. You have to admit, the quality of posts over here are not even close to those over at mitb, so why are there so many mods active over there rather than over here; if the quality of our threads are bad, we should see more mod activity. Of course there are more eligible members to be recommended for mod over at mitb, because they’re not compete idiots. So instead of waiting for someone from mscp to reach mitb expectations as a member so that you can appoint them mod, think of expectations from a mscp member. There are a few members over here that show qualities in holding up a community, but you’re not going to find mitb qualities. I’m just assuming you look for higher expectations, considering mitb mods &gt; mscp mods.</p>
<p>Now I’m not saying to lower your expectations just so that we get more man power over here, but I am saying that you’re putting this as if we don’t have members here that could possibly take on the roll as mod. By now, I know that choosing modding positions for mscp takes time and a well amount of thought due to previous screw ups, but we could really use the help. I sat with someone in a thread who was too lazy to use the search bar. He made multiple threads asking what to set his environmental variables to, and Chassy and I told him a number of times where to look, what tutorial to read, and told him step by step what he was doing wrong. jme later locked the thread and modderated him, but it still took nearly an hour or so before anything actually happened. Situations have happened like this before and sometimes even go unnoticed.</p>

<p>It’s not like there’s a set number though on available staff positions. I don’t have a problem with inactive mods remaining mods (assuming they were once active) because we trust that when they return, or pop in once in a while, they can still make the same descisions. However when a mod becomes inactive, it would be nice to have another mod in their place. Then we would have an active mod and a not so active mod, which is still better then only having an active mod (if we were to demote mods for inactivity that is…)</p>

<p>As for your last post, I hope to see they are good ones. The last ones did not work out so well, e.g Kihomaru and Hasumon. There were a few good ones though such as M.Dog and Taharok, and maybe with the promotions of the new mods you insinuated, you could bump some existing ones to senior mod because the lack of dots given out over here is sad.</p>
