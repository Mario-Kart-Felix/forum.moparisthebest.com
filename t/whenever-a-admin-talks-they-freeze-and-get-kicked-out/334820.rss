    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whenever-a-admin-talks-they-freeze-and-get-kicked-out/334820</link>
    <description>Whenever a Admin Says something, it will kick them out, well. Basically &quot;Freeze&quot;. Than the server says &quot;Username.. data transfered&quot; or something like that.
Is the admin icon not.. like good with the client?
Other people can talk.. non staff. 

Rights 1 doesn&#39;t even have a crown?

Something is wrong, pm me for the link for my server.. It&#39;s webclient/</description>
