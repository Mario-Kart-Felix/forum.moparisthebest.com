    <title>5-o Brutality?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/5-o-brutality/354963</link>
    <description>The other day I was talking to some cops getting my I.D back and the cop gave me a ticket for not wearing a seat belt even though we were parked in a driveway with the car off. When I grabbed the ticket from the cop I turned away and started walking, as i was walking I said FUCKING PIG, he said &quot;what did you say?&quot;, So i repeated what I said, &quot;I said FUCKING PIG&quot;, then he runs up from behind me and I didn&#39;t know this was about to happen, he jumps on my back taking me down to the ground, when he took me down, he pulled his fist up and hit me in the temple (extremely hard), and keep in mind that i never touched him at all. They put me under arrest for assault on an officer, even though i never touched him, he basically assaulted a minor for no reason, I have several witnesses (literally 7 witnesses) that seen this cop do what he did, they all said the cop was out of line and had no reason to do this, I wasn&#39;t even resisting arrest. I then heard the cops talking at the station saying &quot;Hey will you go along with my story, saying that you seen him hit me&quot;, the other cop said &quot;Yes I&#39;ll say that he hit you&quot;. And they never read me my Myranda rights until i was already at the station giving them my prints.

Keep in mind I&#39;m only 17, weighing only 128 pounds, this cop weighed about 230+


Anyone think this is right?</description>

<p>Actually, you can’t use profanity in public. You can get fined for that also. You also insulted the officer, you’re suppose to just take the ticket and be on your way. Deserved every bit of what he did.</p>
<p>Also Frell, just stop arguing with them. It’s a forum, just let them make fun. It shouldn’t do any harm to you seeing as they’re across the Atlantic ocean.</p>

<p>I talked all through the war with Radeon also, but you <em>somehow</em> forget it. Seeing as how the argument spans over almost 2 months. But it was different with him, i was actually arguing with someone who had reason and knew what they were talking about. You are just with the band of misinformed Europeans that think we think we’re always right and wont change you’re views even when you have facts thrown at you, no matter who it is.</p>

<p>Let’s put on our pj’s and read the article!</p>
<blockquote>The invasion of Iraq was undertaken to prevent more American blood from being shed in the name of perverted ideology. The war in Iraq is justified through Saddam Hussein’s link to Al Qaeda, human rights abuses, and the growing threat he posed to western democracy.</blockquote>
<p>Did you know that the Iraqi people are actually Americans? I didn’t, until reading this. Human rights abuses, American blood… Yes, Iraq is populated by Americans. And ‘the growing threat he posed to western democracy’, is this still about the ‘Weapons of mass-destruction’? Contrary to what numerous investigations have uncovered, there still are WMD’s in Iraq (at the time of writing the article).</p>
<blockquote>Opponents of the war in Iraq will admit the terrorist training camps existed inside the nation’s borders, but are quick to point out that the location of the camps were not under the control of Saddam Hussein. This is true but at least one member of Saddam Hussein’s regime was a key operative in the Zarqowi’s terrorist network.</blockquote>
<p>THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE TERRORIST MEMBER OF HUSSEIN’s REGIME! That’s a lot! Especially when you take in mind how few members Hussein’s regime had. Oh wait…</p>
<p>But at least the source of the information is reliable!</p>
<blockquote>“Baghdad has an agent in the most senior levels of the radical organization Ansar al-Islam that controls this corner of Iraq. In 2000, this agent offered al-Qaida safe haven in the region.” ([b]Collin L. Powell, 1[/b])”</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Collin L. Powell, the most reliable man! Everything he says is the truth, deal with it!</p>
<blockquote>The specific activities of this agent are unknown, but it would be naïve to believe this agent did not at least pass Iraqi intelligence over to Ansar al-Islam.</blockquote>
<p>That would be naive, wouldn’t it. We have no idea what the guy is doing, but he is passing Iraqi intelligence to the baddies.</p>
<blockquote>'This is true, intelligence shows Bin Laden met the invasion with disapproval, and may have even considered Iraq a target for future terrorist plots. Critics will also argue that Bin Laden, a religious extremist, was at odds with Saddam’s secular, non-religious government.' ..... 'Bin Laden .... hates America’s support of the “Infidel” nation of Israel.'</blockquote>
<p>Bin Laden hates the infidels in Israel, but he loves the infidel that rules Iraq. How obvious!</p>
<blockquote>What good is a treaty if the agreement cannot be backed with force? Most members of the U.N. seemed comfortable letting the countless human rights and treaty violations go unanswered.</blockquote>
<p>FUCK YEA!! We Americuns don’t like those who violate UN treaties. We will use force! Wait, Israel is violating treaties? Lets help them! Send more weapons!</p>
<blockquote>Perhaps Massachusetts junior Senator John Kerry said it best “No one can doubt or should doubt that we are safer -- and Iraq is better -- because Saddam Hussein is now behind bars." (Kerry,8)</blockquote>
<p>Yea, you got that right. Iraq is a great country to live in now. You can hang out in Baghdad all day, it’s safe as hell!</p>

<p>I talked all through the war with Radeon also, but you <em>somehow</em> forget it. Seeing as how the argument spans over almost 2 months. But it was different with him, i was actually arguing with someone who had reason and knew what they were talking about. You are just with the band of misinformed Europeans that think we think we’re always right and wont change you’re views even when you have facts thrown at you, no matter who it is.</p>

Do me a favor and tell me (from the farthest back you can remember) what you think went on before we finally went over to the middle east.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I was clearly referring to the USA arming Iraq with weaponry and intelligence and not the entire “middle east” (because shit, who needs specific countries and individuals when you have propaganda) situation.[/quote]<br>
Well if you knew the backstory then it wouldnt be us just “arming” iraq with weaponry. You act like we did it for the hell of it and ignorance like this is what pisses me off.</p>
<p>If it werent for us arming Saddam with weapons we would have gone to war with Iran. Iran kept attacking either Isreal, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, i cant remember of the top of my head. But Saddam was also either at war with Iran or something at the time, i havent had time to re-research it again yet but he was basically keeping Iran in check from messing with Isreal and Kuwait and Saudi (our allies). By allying with Iraq and sending them weaponry we could be sure to keep Iran away from Kuwait and Saudi which are the worlds most biggest oil suppliers. By allying with Iraq we knew Iran would be kept in check without us spending our own blood or money on the situation (What??!?! America avoided a straight on war?!?!? no way!!)</p>
<p>But IIRC when Saddam invaded Iran he went straight into Kuwait and demanded control of the worlds oil supply and kuwait asked us to help (Desert Storm) and when we drove Saddam out of kuwait he had his entire military set the oil wells in kuwait on fire. Yada yada yada more crimes against humanity and then 9/11 by Al-Qaeda was eventually linked to Saddam for wiring the attackers with money and hideouts in America and that was the last straw after 30 years of conflict and we went over.</p>
<p>Theres the war in a nutshell, countries and stuff might not be Precise but i gotta be somewhere.</p>
<p>This is probably what you guys heard on the news in Europe:<br>
US arms Saddam with missiles for no known reason, and shortly after attacks Iraq claiming to be going after missiles. What is the motive of this war? Specialists say Bush is trying to increase oil imports to the US by invading the countries overseas and providing the country with a discount on oil and gaining benefit over other countries purchasing oil from the same supplier.</p>
<p>We havent taken jack shit oil since the war started.</p>
<p>OH MY GOD THE WAR ISNT UNJUSTIFIED??? LEAVE US ALONE.</p>
