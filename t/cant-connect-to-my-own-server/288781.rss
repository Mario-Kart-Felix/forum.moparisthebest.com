    <title>Can&#39;t connect to my own server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-connect-to-my-own-server/288781</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been on here for a while, and recently got a new computer, so everything was lost. I&#39;m at the point where it says the server compiled fine, the server is online, and the client is running fine. But when I try to get on my server, it says random things like &quot;An unexpected error has occured&quot;. I tried a couple different usernames, passwords, ip&#39;s (localhost, 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1) and even a couple of different clients and sources. I checked my firewall and it&#39;s off. What else can be the problem?

Forgot to mention: I checked the port, it was the correct port for each source (43594)</description>
