    <description>Okay I have two questions. Does anyone know how to change the amout of exp given from cutting a tree? I want to be able to cut a regular tree and get like.....3k exp or something.
Can someone help me?
Also my other question was...When I compile my server, it doesn&#39;t load summonging....it says like config\objects.cfg: files not found.
And then it says &quot;Loaded 25 monsters from Summon.cfg&quot;
But....there&#39;s no summonging skill or anything.</description>
