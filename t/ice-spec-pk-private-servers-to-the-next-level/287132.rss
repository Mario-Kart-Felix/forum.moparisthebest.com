    <title>Ice Spec Pk --- Private Servers to the next level!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ice-spec-pk-private-servers-to-the-next-level/287132</link>
    <description>------------------------------------------------------

Would you play a 317 server that was setup like world of warcraft? I will make a server that will contain the following:

------------------------------------------------------

What make this server different from others:
+ 2 sides
+ Everywhere pk but can only pk the other team with restricted level range or wilderness level 10
+ There will be city raiding (all citys will have a chest that they can click on and will recieve money/item)
+ Home areas will be Varrock(team1) and Ardougne(team2)
+ Donar Items (little amount of donar stuff though) --- It will help to get Dedicated and Sponsore
+ Only teleports from you city to another location of your city.
+ NO CUSTOM ITEMS

------------------------------------------------------

Questions for you:
How many sides? 
What should the names of the teams be?
What do you think the wilderness level should be?
How many cities do you think should have the chests?
What do you think they should recieve from this chest?
Should there be ::pure?
Should the Skilling area for both teams be in the same area (a safe zone)?
Should there be donar items?
Should i put in commands in the quest menu?
Should i put quests in the server?
Should i make a quick pk area (an area that there will be quick fighting)?
Should there be unlimited run?

------------------------------------------------------

Last Question:
Shops - Rich Shops(good items in shops)?
           Good Shops(some good items in shops)?
           Poor Shops(not good items at all)?

------------------------------------------------------

[b]Problems [color=red]With[/color] [color=limegreen]Making[/color] [color=orange]This[/color] [color=purple]Server:[/color][/b]
+ Amount of time to build server
+ The amount of people! If we dont have a good amount of people we cant run this type of server very well

------------------------------------------------------

To truely be like WOW there would have to be many attributes put in. . . .<br>
1)WASD walking<br>
2)Different races(If you actually did this, this server could become really popular imo)<br>
3)Two sides, like you said<br>

              <p>okay, idk how many sides, there should be a chest in all cities, should be lamps, money, items (weapons), etc. from chests, no ::pure command unless you’re admin or owner, make skilling area for both teams, but it is spread out and they can still attack each other ( trees are spread out over a wide field, same with all other things), yeah, i think if you’re a donator you should get special items. NO COMMANDS IN QUEST AREA, PUT QUESTS THERE. Yes to quests, it should define what rank they are in there team, which alows them to get sertain items to represent their team, which gives better defence (and maybe offense) bonuses each rank. Also defines what you get from chest. and what cities you can raid. sure, you can make a quick pk area i guess. With the run, it should be determined by the rank you are. At start you will have only 100. Then next rank you get 115 or 125. then so one.</p>
<p>If this idea comes true then i will Definetly play more then i will my own lol. besides i want to make one sorta like this. Only instead it’s like runescape. But has npc vs npc, and there will be at least 4 teams. And a pvp place. and  you get certain armours and weapons depending on whcich team you’re in. But if you kill someone on another team, and they drop something for another team, you will HAVE to sell at your team shop. but at team shop it won’t show up.</p>

              <p>This is not really a hard thing to do, all you got to do is setup two bool methods, team1 = true, team2 = false. And in your combat methods, (to check if they’re in wilderness), just  add the two boolean. And in the start, just have them choose between two portals, etc.</p>

              <p>Lmfao, dude this sounds pretty damn awesome. I think there should be 4 sides, i think you should put a chest in every city, i think they should receive gold, weapons, and armor from the chest, no there shouldn’t be a pure command, i think there should be separate skilling areas for example a grassland one and a rocky one. What i mean by this is one should be in a grassy area and one should be in a rocky area. There should be donator items, just make typing commands, and yes there should be unlimited run.</p>
<p>Note - Hope i helped.</p>

              <hr>
<p>Would you play a 317 server that was setup like world of warcraft? I will make a server that will contain the following:</p>
<hr>
<p>What make this server different from others:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 sides</li>
<li>Everywhere pk but can only pk the other team with restricted level range or wilderness level 10</li>
<li>There will be city raiding (all citys will have a chest that they can click on and will recieve money/item)</li>
<li>Home areas will be Varrock(team1) and Ardougne(team2)</li>
<li>Donar Items (little amount of donar stuff though) — It will help to get Dedicated and Sponsore</li>
<li>Only teleports from you city to another location of your city.</li>
<li>NO CUSTOM ITEMS</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Questions for you:<br>
How many sides?<br>
What should the names of the teams be?<br>
What do you think the wilderness level should be?<br>
How many cities do you think should have the chests?<br>
What do you think they should recieve from this chest?<br>
Should there be ::pure?<br>
Should the Skilling area for both teams be in the same area (a safe zone)?<br>
Should there be donar items?<br>
Should i put in commands in the quest menu?<br>
Should i put quests in the server?<br>
Should i make a quick pk area (an area that there will be quick fighting)?<br>
Should there be unlimited run?</p>
<hr>
<p>Last Question:<br>
Shops - Rich Shops(good items in shops)?<br>
Good Shops(some good items in shops)?<br>
Poor Shops(not good items at all)?</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Problems [color=red]With[/color] [color=limegreen]Making[/color] [color=orange]This[/color] [color=purple]Server:[/color]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Amount of time to build server</li>
<li>The amount of people! If we dont have a good amount of people we cant run this type of server very well</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Please Dont Leach Ideas</p>
