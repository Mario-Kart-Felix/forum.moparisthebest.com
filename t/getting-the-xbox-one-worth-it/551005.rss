    <description>I really want to get the Master Chief Collection, but it&#39;s only for Xbox-One. Is it worth blowing all that money? What do you guys think?</description>

I actually can’t remember why I bought it.<br>
I think at the time it was just to get “the next big console”. And the Halo series. I’ve played it since Halo 1 on the original xbox. But I didn’t relate halo 3 to the 360. Nor do I think I even knew it was going to be made…</p>

You’d think that…</p>
<p>But my xbox 360, which I own like 50+ games (totally unsure on the count since i have a bunch downloaded and a bunch not downloaded that I own).<br>

1, maybe 2 a month.</p>
