You were trying to say that blowing yourself up, wounding/killing numerous civilians in order to cause a few casualties for foreign troops is justifiable. I cannot see how that is? I can however see that it has been done long before the Middle-East wars, and will probably not be stopped if we ever face insurgents again. The whole aim of it is to kill the nearby troops, and to wound the rest; who are then shipped home, provided they’re injured, and they live with the fact civilians were killed nearby them. It’s the old saying; kill the enemy from within. al-Qaeda does this the best, by infiltrating the United States Military (this doesn’t really apply to the British military because it doesn’t let any random idiot off the street join) and killing their own troops with friendly fire.</p>
<p>Was it really a childish point? In the Boer War you shot 3 of our best Light Horsemen because they carried out orders which were given by the British Army General, because they refused to continue following your orders. “Shoot straight ya’ bastards. Don’t make a mess of it”.<br>
Anyway, getting back to my point: if you honestly think suicide bombing is justifiable, you’re a faggot.</p>
<p>ps I’m not going to argue about the British military anymore, I still have a great deal of respect for it.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is that your answer, really? I don’t recall ever even implying i thought the british and US military never slipped up, i actually think quite the opposite. But you outright saying their method to war is “exterminate at all costs” which is far from true.</p>

I never said killing civilians was justified.

<blockquote>In the Boer War [b]you[/b] shot 3 of our best Light Horsemen</blockquote>
<p>Did I really shoot 3 horsemen? Me? Saying that because the army which belongs to the same place I live killed a few people wrongly does not mean I condone it. That’s like saying if a few black people have knifed people that means all black people do that. There is no need to bring up my nationality and what you said was therefore childish.</p>

Name one suicide bombing which hasn’t killed civilians? Also, you have a dig at me when I stereotype you because of your military activity from a century ago, yet British people constantly refer to Australians as criminals. That was 2 centuries ago, and you won’t let that go.</p>

<p>You were trying to say that blowing yourself up, wounding/killing numerous civilians in order to cause a few casualties for foreign troops is justifiable. I cannot see how that is? I can however see that it has been done long before the Middle-East wars, and will probably not be stopped if we ever face insurgents again. The whole aim of it is to kill the nearby troops, and to wound the rest; who are then shipped home, provided they’re injured, and they live with the fact civilians were killed nearby them. It’s the old saying; kill the enemy from within. al-Qaeda does this the best, by infiltrating the United States Military (this doesn’t really apply to the British military because it doesn’t let any random idiot off the street join) and killing their own troops with friendly fire.</p>
<p>Was it really a childish point? In the Boer War you shot 3 of our best Light Horsemen because they carried out orders which were given by the British Army General, because they refused to continue following your orders. “Shoot straight ya’ bastards. Don’t make a mess of it”.<br>
Anyway, getting back to my point: if you honestly think suicide bombing is justifiable, you’re a faggot.</p>
<p>ps I’m not going to argue about the British military anymore, I still have a great deal of respect for it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I never said killing civilians was justified. I meant exactly what I said when I said there isn’t a difference between throwing a grenade at someone and strapping a grenade to yourself and walking up to your enemy. ^^ If you agree with what I just said then there’s your proof that suicide bombing is justifiable.</p>

</aside>
<p>Did I really shoot 3 horsemen? Me? Saying that because the army which belongs to the same place I live killed a few people wrongly does not mean I condone it. That’s like saying if a few black people have knifed people that means all black people do that. There is no need to bring up my nationality and what you said was therefore childish.<br>

Yes… That’s exactly my point. War isn’t justifiable because it kills innocent civilians, nor is suicide bombing.</p>
