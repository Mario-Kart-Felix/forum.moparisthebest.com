<p>It seems you missed the point I was trying to make. If you’re an atheist, you don’t believe in an afterlife and therefore you’re not accountable for anything you do - as long as you don’t get caught of course. I don’t see how that would stop any atheist from blowing himself up along with innocent civilians, all it would take is for him to be fed up with his life. When in comparison to a religious person, you’d need to convince him to put aside a lot of factors which would ultimately stand against his very basic principles.</p>
<p>The religions of the world are countless and they all incorporate many different conflicting principles. So defending religion as a whole sounds pointless to me.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you think, not everybody is out to get you. You need to stop your victim mentality.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental principles of capitalism is that if everybody has the freedom to trade, everyone will be better off. In this example, if the west and the middle-east could trade freely they would settle on an equilibrium with the west getting the oil it wants and the middle-east getting money.<br>
I’ve already pointed out the example of good trade between the US and Saudi Arabia.[/quote]<br>
Where did you get the notion that religion is against free trade? This really depends on the specific religion you have in mind. But as far as I’m concerned, the three main religions (that being Christianity, Judaism and Islam) all practice free trade.</p>
<p>Look at the recession we’re faced with. Do you know what caused it?</p>

<p>You could build the nicest society in the world if you were to steal the world’s wealth and keep it to a small minority. Sure society would be nice if everyone in the world were to do good. But if you’re an atheist, then the only part of society that matters is that which is close to you. So it would be extremely beneficial to steal all the wealth from the rest of the world and bring it home. So if you do good just because you think it’ll make society nicer <span class="bbcode-b">to you</span>, you should stop doing good.</p>
<p>There are around one billion Muslims in the world, I think we can both agree that the majority of them aren’t ‘terrorists’. So obviously it’s not the religion that led a few of them to be corrupt. Otherwise we would have seen a considerably larger volume of ‘terrorist attacks’.</p>
<p>Back on topic:<br>
Where in history have atheists been subject to the same suffering which religious people (mainly Muslims) are faced with? Unless you can recall an example, I don’t think you can predict how atheists would react.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is a good question, and I think I know an answer.<br>
First, you assume that everyone who suffers believes in God, but actually religious belief declines after famines, disasters, tsunamis, etc. After all, what kind of God would senselessly kill people like that? This argument from evil can be very convincing to people who’ve lost their entire families.<br>
Furthermore, every living thing has evolved an instinct for self-preservation. That might come into it.<br>
Also, correct me if I’m wrong but your argument seems go, “Everybody wants to kill themselves. Religious people are accountable to God so they wont kill themselves. Atheists are not accountable so they will all kill themselves.” It is the first sentance of that which I dont quite accept.</p>

</aside>
<p>The worldly benefit is that there is less suffering in the world. Atheists are also human and they also feel simpathy and a sense of how would they like it if it happened to them.<br>
Its a myth that only religious people do charity. In fact, going on the Haiti example you brough up, the largest aid organisations are secular ones. The International Red Cross, Doctors without Borders, Oxfam, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Never did I say that religion is against free trade. Philosophies of free trade didnt really exist when most religions were started anyway.<br>
All I said was that religion could lead to terrorism, and I used the example of suicide bombing, and that would hinder free trade which happens to be helpful to everybody.</p>
<p>As a brief note, almost all American bankers are either Jewish or Christian, they were supported heavily by the American Republican party which has a very strong Christian presence. So I wont accept that atheists caused the recession.</p>

So if you do good just because you think it’ll make society nicer <span class="bbcode-b">to you</span>, you should stop doing good.[/quote]</p>
<p>That would not be a nice society because people have stolen to make it, and stealing isnt nice, so by definition it isnt a nice society…</p>
<p>[quote=“MujaheD, post:22, topic:326054”]There are around one billion Muslims in the world, I think we can both agree that the majority of them aren’t ‘terrorists’. So obviously it’s not the religion that led a few of them to be corrupt. Otherwise we would have seen a considerably larger volume of ‘terrorist attacks’.</p>
<p>Back on topic:<br>
Where in history have atheists been subject to the same suffering which religious people (mainly Muslims) are faced with? Unless you can recall an example, I don’t think you can predict how atheists would react.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thats impossible to say because atheists are not united, the word simply means a lack of religious belief.<br>
You could say that due to the dominance of religion in the last 2500 years, atheists have been oppressed all that time as all religions are against atheism. Its only in the last 200 years that atheism has gained ‘believers’ and that more governments have become democratic and secular.<br>
Also, as much as you like to pretend otherwise, muslims are not united either. There are Sunni and Shi’ite factions, and more middle-easterners have died due to Islamic terrorism in the last 10 years then westerners.</p>
<p>In summary, religious belief will lead to ‘terrorist’ acts and I used the example of suicide bombing.</p>

<p>Even if it was true that a lack of belief lead to crime, it doesnt refute the argument that religious belief leads to suicide bombings. It seems you’re trying to do a “you also” argument, where it goes “suicide bombings dont matter because atheism leads to crime”</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The only reason I likened atheism to crime is because you seemed to think that if the whole world was atheist, no one would commit crime (i.e suicide bombing). I think I clearly demonstrated that atheism won’t prevent criminals from committing crimes. Similarly, religious people aren’t immune from crime either but you can’t blame their religion as if it’s the cause of all of their actions.</p>
<p>To add to that, in the case of suicide bombings, ultimately it’s the circumstances which these people face that causes them to go down that road. Sure, sometimes religious leaders justify these actions but at times the oppression that their people face is so great that it actually is the best response.</p>
<p>Take this for example, a child watches his mother die after an Israeli warplane drops a bomb in their area.<br>
<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/61/210051023_ab3fa65015_o.jpg" alt width="550" height="367"><br>
Let me ask you, had this boy been an atheist, do you think he would be any less motivated to blow himself up around Israeli soldiers?</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:23, topic:326054”]Also, global warming is caused by a reduced number of pirates.<br>
Correlation does not imply causation.</p>
<p>furthermore, even if it was true that atheism lead to crime, it doesnt rebutt my arguments that religious belief justified the terrorist act of suicide bombing.[/quote]<br>
Suicide bombers have used their religion to justify their actions. At times they’ve bent rules to their liking in order to commit what would otherwise not be permissible. But you need to take into consideration what compelled them to do so. That being oppression at the hands of both religious and atheist parties.</p>
<p>So religion never compelled anyone to kill innocents, rather religious principles were distorted to justify what is clearly against religious ideology.</p>
<p>In the case of an atheist, there are no rules he’d need to break or bend. All it would take is for him to face the circumstances which religious people have been through.</p>

<p>I really dont see how it would be selfish, you would be helping your entire society not yourself. If anything, its much more selfless then doing good just because you expect to be rewarded in heaven.</p>

</aside>
<p>Doing something good because you expect to be rewarded in heaven isn’t selfish. Considering that doing good normally comes at the expense of your own well-being or pleasure, even if you expect to be rewarded for it later it still counts as being selfless.</p>
<p>Although I agree that doing good when you’re an atheist is quite selfless, especially when most of the time it doesn’t involve a benefit to yourself at all.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:23, topic:326054”]That is a good question, and I think I know an answer.<br>
First, you assume that everyone who suffers believes in God, but actually religious belief declines after famines, disasters, tsunamis, etc. After all, what kind of God would senselessly kill people like that? This argument from evil can be very convincing to people who’ve lost their entire families.<br>
Furthermore, every living thing has evolved an instinct for self-preservation. That might come into it.<br>
Also, correct me if I’m wrong but your argument seems go, “Everybody wants to kill themselves. Religious people are accountable to God so they wont kill themselves. Atheists are not accountable so they will all kill themselves.” It is the first sentance of that which I dont quite accept.[/quote]<br>
I think my assumption of poor people being mostly or even entirely from religious backgrounds is quite true. Take a look at Africa, South America etc. The Somalian people for example have kept tight with their religion despite being faced with poverty, war and famine. I think that negates your argument that when people suffer they lose hope in religion.</p>
<p>I didn’t mean to imply that everyone wants to kill themselves, in fact I don’t think I did. Rather, I was referring to people who live lives that put them through misery and suffering. Why don’t they all just rid themselves of their pain and kill themselves? Because they believe in religion.</p>
<p>I don’t really know of any atheist people who are faced with harsh life conditions, but since they don’t believe in religion, I’m assuming that they’d just kill themselves. But since i don’t know anyone that meets that criteria, I guess I really can’t say. What would you do if your life consisted only of suffering and misery?</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:23, topic:326054”]The worldly benefit is that there is less suffering in the world. Atheists are also human and they also feel simpathy and a sense of how would they like it if it happened to them.<br>
Its a myth that only religious people do charity. In fact, going on the Haiti example you brough up, the largest aid organisations are secular ones. The International Red Cross, Doctors without Borders, Oxfam, etc, etc.[/quote]<br>
Red <span class="bbcode-b">Cross</span> as in the cross that Christians believe Jesus was crucified on?</p>
<p>How is it any benefit to you that there’s less suffering in the world? If anything it would be a disadvantage because it could only ever cost you your wealth or effort etc.</p>
<p>How does sympathy have any place in atheist doctrine? Why would you feel sympathetic for anyone? You said it yourself, ‘This is the only life we’ve got and we want to make the most of it’. Make the most of it, don’t waste your wealth or effort on people who in no way can benefit you.</p>
<p>Of course you wouldn’t like it if it happened to you, but if it did, do you expect Haitians to have the resources to even help you? Besides it’s probably not likely that it would happen to you, unless of course you live in an earth quake zone which if that is the case then you probably might want to be on the good side of international aid organizations.</p>

<p>As a brief note, almost all American bankers are either Jewish or Christian, they were supported heavily by the American Republican party which has a very strong Christian presence. So I wont accept that atheists caused the recession.[/quote]<br>
Sure, religion can lead to terrorism. In fact, almost any ideology can lead to terrorism if you can persecute it’s people enough.</p>
<p>Maybe the recession wasn’t caused by atheists, but it’s the whole notion of ‘this is the only life we’ve got and we want to make the most of it’ which atheists profess that ultimately led to the recession. Had these businessmen actually believed that they would be accountable for what they’d done, then I don’t think they would have caused this big mess.</p>

Yes atheists aren’t to blame for the economic crisis, but it’s the atheist attitude of ‘This is the only life we’ve got and we want to make the most of it’ that drove those Jews to do what they did.

<p>Being accountable in this life only means being found out by authorities doesn’t it? In the example I gave, the recession, was anyone held accountable for the mischief they caused? Didn’t Barrack Obama bail out the banks that caused the whole mess?</p>

<p>An ideology will push someone to blow up himself and everyone around him. I won’t say that there won’t be any Atheists that will do so, but history shows that 98% (rough guesstimate) of the suicide bombings was done by someone with a radical religious background.

<p>Suicide bombings can also be an act of despair, but most of the bombers believe that they are doing a good thing, and will be rewarded for that in the afterlife. For Atheists, there is no afterlife, so only when such an act is reasonable, they’ll do so.</p>

<p>Well I’m not going to comment on the bible but when it comes to the Qur’an, it certainly doesn’t command killing Non-believers in general. If you want clarification about any particular verse, please pm me.</p>

<p>An ideology will push someone to blow up himself and everyone around him. I won’t say that there won’t be any Atheists that will do so, but history shows that 98% (rough guesstimate) of the suicide bombings was done by someone with a radical religious background. The media will jump to conclusions when a Muslim does so, but they’ll say it was done by a lunatic when they find evidence of Christian extremism.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the reason that most, if not all, suicide attacks are committed by people of religions is that pretty much all the conflicts of the world involve people of religions. The only role religion plays in this is that it tells people to defend themselves even at the expense of their own lives. Suicide bombing obviously wasn’t specifically mentioned in any religious texts, and so it’s justification must have been the result of someone distorting religious principles.</p>
<p>Of course in this case I’m talking about suicide bombing that intentionally results in the death of civilians.</p>

<p>Suicide bombings can also be an act of despair, but most of the bombers believe that they are doing a good thing, and will be rewarded for that in the afterlife. For Atheists, there is no afterlife, so only when such an act is reasonable, they’ll do so.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well as I mentioned in an earlier post, it’s pointless defending religion as a whole (due to the diversity of the religions of the world) but when it comes to the Muslims who justify the murder of innocent civilians, they do so after distorting religious texts according to their own whims. That being said, suicide bombings that involve the the deliberate targetting of civilians aren’t exactly very numerous.</p>

<p>That’s why I said, had they truly believed they would be accountable, they wouldn’t have put the world through this. It feels like they’d adopted an atheist attitude of no accountability and so let’s go for it.</p>
<p>Anyway I feel our discussion is going a bit too off course. I would rather not debate faith or atheism because there are many people on this forum that I respect who happen to be atheists. The topic is about the ‘war on terror’ so let’s try and discuss that.</p>

        <p>I’ll try to reduce the size of the post.</p>
<p>I agree that Palestinian youth seeing their mothers dying is a contributing factor to suicide bombing, but we must not forget that these young men are prohibited from contact with women, sex is forbidden until marriage and masturbation is condemned. Its not healthy to deny your own sexuality like this and I think its very plausible that these sexual deprived young adults find the promise of 72 virgins absolutely irresistible.<br>
I can’t see how a non-believer of sound mind would want to kill themselves, because for them death is the end. For theists, the word “suicide” is wrong, you don’t lose you life when the bomb explodes, you’re still alive in heaven.</p>
<p>We also must remember the actual reason there is conflict in the Holy Land. The Abrahamic religions ultimately caused the divisions that lead to the weapon of religion being used.</p>
<p>Atheism technically doesn’t have any doctrines, its simply a statement of lack of belief.<br>
Sympathy is a part of human nature, atheists and theists alike feel it because they are all human. Unless you’re a psychopath, you’ll find its hard to know of another person suffering without feeling pity. I don’t see why “making the most of life” means you have to not bother with charity.</p>
<p>According to the Red Cross <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=87855" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, the emblem is ultimately taken from the Christian cross, however they doesn’t see Christianity as important, this shows because they also use a Red Crescent and Red Crystal in areas where the people might not be friendly to Christians or Muslims. The site says clearly that “Neither emblem has any religious or political significance.” It shows that the Red Cross care more about saving lives then spreading <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=86767" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">religion</a>.</p>

        <p>@ RIP RSC<br>
Please read the Holy Qu’ran before you make any comments.<br>
The Qu’ran forbids any act of suicide and strongly condems it. In Islam, there is no place for a suicide bomber or anyone who has committed suicide. Islam also does not allow Muslims to involve its self in war. Muslims are only allowed to get involved in war if the war is in direct conflict of our beliefs, i.e we are allowed to defend ourselves. Islam is a peaceful religion but it’s been so hyped up with the war against terror that many around the world link terrorism to Islam. That is wrong.<br>
We also do not allow the killings of other humans and believers of other religions. The reason why the growth of Islam has been great is because Islam tends to attract believers and converts by the way of it’s living, it’s compassion and it’s love. It doesn’t influence war or acts of crime.</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) was inflicted with great pain and despair in his life, but he never prayed to Allah for the killing of the Jews and other people who did not believe in Islam. He told all the Muslims that they should be compassionate and follow the true ethics of the religion. Islam builds a society of trust and love.<br>
In fact, he would write to other leaders of different religions, have talks with them too.<br>
Islam is not a forceful religion, actually we’ve been told to mould our character in such a way that believers of other religions would recognize what kind of religion Islam is and convert to Islam is.</p>
<p>I can’t believe how you could base your ideas that Islam allows suicide bombings and of such.</p>

<p>This is an odd thing about religion. If you have a disagreement in science, you do an experiment to see who’s right. If you have a disagreement in government, you have a debate and vote to see what should be done.<br>

<p>It seems people just take the religion of their parents. They are Muslim because they were born in the middle-east, but they would probably be Christian if they were born in America.</p>

There’s where you get it wrong.<br>
Muslim scholars around the Middle-East justify the suicide attacks against the Americans (or any foreign force there for that matter) as it is an act of retaliation and that these Muslims do not have arms or means of defense possible to defend themselves. The only feasible option of defending themselves and their families is to kill themselves through suicide. These men are considered brave and are also known to be martyrs.</p>

Islam treats women with great respect in it’s society. Take the example of that women who was kidnapped by the Afghanistan Taliban. She said that they treated her with respect and harmony.

Women are treated how they should be, not as sex symbols so as in some Western societies.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is not allowed in Islam as Islam believes that a man and a woman are together, a wheel that run life. If one is absent, the wheel is incomplete and hence life is incomplete.

Homosexuals are not frowned upon in Islamic societies as no Islamic man is a homosexual (I cannot recall an incident of one).</p>

<p>First of all, <span class="bbcode-b">suicide bombing</span> cannot be justified as a means to protest (retaliate). This is using other people as a means to and end(using people) which is not morally right, no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>Secondly why should you <span class="bbcode-b">treat women differently</span>? You say that it is right to treat them as objects and control what they can and can’t wear/do, you justify this by saying you treat them better than you would a man. It isn’t morally right to judge someone on who they are rather than what they do or have done. Also you say in Islam women are treated how they should be and that American women are wrong? How can you possibly say that, there are no global rules for this sort of thing. Your culture believes one thing, western cultures believe a different thing. Leave us alone.</p>
<p>Thirdly <span class="bbcode-b">homosexuality</span> has nothing to do with reproducing. In ancient Greece a lot of the men had homosexual relations and still fathered children with women so you can’t justify that homosexuals are bad because it kills the human race.</p>
<p>Finally how the fuck can you justify trying to fuck up other cultures? Different cultures believe different things and you have no right to influence another cultures beliefs. You live by your culture, I live by mine. There is absolutely no point in suicide bombing to push your shitty religion onto me.</p>
<p>I think this is the first time I’ve raged this much.</p>

        <p>akl, you are very wrong, ignorant and mistaken. Here is why.</p>
<p>Firstly, you contradicts yourself. You say “The Qu’ran forbids any act of suicide and strongly condems it.”, but then in a later post you say that suicide is okay because its the only feasable option. I agree the suicide bombers are brave, their religion gives them almost superhuman courage. They dont need to fear death as its not the end, they only look forward to an eternaty in heaven and 72 virgins.<br>
Furthermore, you missed my point with that which was that you cant explain why your interpretation of Islam is better then anybody elses who says Muslims should be suicide bombers.</p>
<p>There are many many ex-muslims, its simply wrong to say that its impossible to leave Islam. See some of their websites.<br>
<a href="http://www.ex-muslim.org.uk/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ex-muslim.org.uk/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.apostatesofislam.com/apostates.htm" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.apostatesofislam.com/apostates.htm</a><br>
<a href="http://bibleprobe.com/islamapostates.htm" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://bibleprobe.com/islamapostates.htm</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, feeding women at proper times does not constitute treating them equally to men.<br>
The women have to be covered, why dont men cover themselves either? Men can have more the one wife but women cannot have more then one husband.</p>
<p>There is also justification from scripture.</p>
<blockquote>    * A woman is worth one-half a man. 2:282 ; and males are to inherit twice that of females. 4:11
    *Men are in charge of women, because Allah made men to be better than women. Refuse to have sex with women from whom you fear rebellion, and scourge them. 4:34
    * Lewd women are to be confined to their houses until death. 4:15
    * You can't have sex with married women, unless they are slaves obtained in war (with whom you may rape or do whatever you like). 4:24
    * Don't pray if you are drunk, dirty, or have touched a woman lately. 4:43
    * A husband can accuse his wife of adultery with only one witness. 24:6</blockquote>
<p>Islam’s views on homosexuality are bigoted and homophobic.<br>
Its wrong to say that there exist no homosexual muslims. Here is a link to one who tried to re-interpret the Quran.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Muslim+Edmonton+scholar+pariah+religious+community/2401734/story.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Muslim+Edmonton+scholar+pariah+religious+community/2401734/story.html</a></p>
<blockquote>EDMONTON — Junaid Bin Jahangir was such a devout Muslim that when he arrived in Canada he ate only yogurt for two days until he was sure which food followed halal dietary rules.
The university student prayed five times a day, and joined a local mosque.
Then one day, at age 27, he started to wonder why he had never been with a girl. "Why don't I like women that way?" he asked, and it led him to a counselling office, where he sat, sobbing, with the realization that he was gay — a pariah in his own community.
Mainstream Islamic leaders say gay men should be shunned and some around the world are killed each year.</blockquote>
<p>SO in conclusion, you’re wrong and ignorant of your own religion. And I would very much like if you could explain <span class="bbcode-i">why you believe that all other interpretations of Islam are wrong except for yours.</span></p>

        <p>[quote=“yakman, post:33, topic:326054”]akl, you are very wrong, ignorant and mistaken. Here is why.</p>
<p>Firstly, you contradicts yourself. You say “The Qu’ran forbids any act of suicide and strongly condems it.”, but then in a later post you say that suicide is okay because its the only feasable option. I agree the suicide bombers are brave, their religion gives them almost superhuman courage. They dont need to fear death as its not the end, they only look forward to an eternaty in heaven and 72 virgins.<br>
Furthermore, you missed my point with that which was that you cant explain why your interpretation of Islam is better then anybody elses who says Muslims should be suicide bombers.[/quote]<br>
You misinterpret what ever I said. In certain circumstances the only way out of it or to defend oneself is to kill yourself or in other words, sacrifice yourself in order to protect others.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:33, topic:326054”]There are many many ex-muslims, its simply wrong to say that its impossible to leave Islam. See some of their websites.<br>

I believe I used the word theoretically. I did not mention the possibility of it being impossible. Obviously you can leave Islam.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:33, topic:326054”]Furthermore, feeding women at proper times does not constitute treating them equally to men.<br>
The women have to be covered, why dont men cover themselves either? Men can have more the one wife but women cannot have more then one husband.[/quote]<br>
That part was directed at how women are treated in an Islamic society considering the fact that she was a <span class="bbcode-b">hostage</span>.<br>
I’ll look into why men don’t cover themselves and get back to you.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:33, topic:326054”]Islam’s views on homosexuality are bigoted and homophobic.<br>
Its wrong to say that there exist no homosexual muslims. Here is a link to one who tried to re-interpret the Quran.</p>

<p>[quote]EDMONTON — Junaid Bin Jahangir was such a devout Muslim that when he arrived in Canada he ate only yogurt for two days until he was sure which food followed halal dietary rules.<br>
The university student prayed five times a day, and joined a local mosque.<br>
Then one day, at age 27, he started to wonder why he had never been with a girl. “Why don’t I like women that way?” he asked, and it led him to a counselling office, where he sat, sobbing, with the realization that he was gay — a pariah in his own community.<br>
Mainstream Islamic leaders say gay men should be shunned and some around the world are killed each year.[/quote][/quote]<br>
Well, like I said, I never heard of a man being gay in Islam but I’ll have to read up on this and respond to it.</p>

<p>My interpretations can be wrong and so can the Islamic leaders as Islam is such a huge religion that people all around the world, Muslims or non-Muslims, twist the laws and beliefs of Islam to suit/justify their needs. The best you can do is sought resort to buying a translation of the Holy Qu’ran and read it. But I’m sure you wouldn’t do that, not that I mean it in an offending manner but just that it won’t do you any good.</p>

        <p>[quote=“yakman, post:28, topic:326054”]I’ll try to reduce the size of the post.</p>
<p>I agree that Palestinian youth seeing their mothers dying is a contributing factor to suicide bombing, but we must not forget that these young men are prohibited from contact with women, sex is forbidden until marriage and masturbation is condemned. Its not healthy to deny your own sexuality like this and I think its very plausible that these sexual deprived young adults find the promise of 72 virgins absolutely irresistible.<br>
I can’t see how a non-believer of sound mind would want to kill themselves, because for them death is the end. For theists, the word “suicide” is wrong, you don’t lose you life when the bomb explodes, you’re still alive in heaven.</p>
<p>We also must remember the actual reason there is conflict in the Holy Land. The Abrahamic religions ultimately caused the divisions that lead to the weapon of religion being used.</p>
<p>Atheism technically doesn’t have any doctrines, its simply a statement of lack of belief.<br>
Sympathy is a part of human nature, atheists and theists alike feel it because they are all human. Unless you’re a psychopath, you’ll find its hard to know of another person suffering without feeling pity. I don’t see why “making the most of life” means you have to not bother with charity.</p>
<p>According to the Red Cross <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=87855" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, the emblem is ultimately taken from the Christian cross, however they doesn’t see Christianity as important, this shows because they also use a Red Crescent and Red Crystal in areas where the people might not be friendly to Christians or Muslims. The site says clearly that “Neither emblem has any religious or political significance.” It shows that the Red Cross care more about saving lives then spreading <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=86767" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">religion</a>.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’ve wrongfully accused suicide bombers of doing what they do because they want to have sex. That’s outright ridiculous because they could have all the sex they want had they chosen to stay alive. All it would take is for them to be married and that isn’t really an obstacle. In fact, if it was their main motive to have sex then it would have been more practical for them to stay alive because they’d only have the reward of the 72 virgins after judgement day - which if they’d chosen to stay alive, they could have sex both in this life and the next.</p>
<p>Unlike atheists, theists are at peace with the fact that whether they like it or not, in the end they will die.</p>
<p>‘I can’t see how a non-believer of sound mind would want to kill themselves, because for them death is the end’<br>
In the example I mentioned earlier, where the boy watched his mother die in his own hands, had he been an atheist don’t you think he still would be motivated to do so? As far as I’m concerned, anyone with a sound mind would want to retaliate and cause the maximum damage possible.</p>
<p>You spoke of the conflict between the Abrahamic religions in the holly land as if they all intend to kill each other. You can’t blame all three religions for the actions of their people (because no one can represent a religion perfectly). Let’s take the crusades for example. The Christians massacred Muslims and destroyed their mosques. When Saladin took back Jerusalem, he didn’t kill a single Christian, he even allowed many to stay. So just because there’s conflict in the region, it doesn’t mean that all religion is false and all they bring is death.</p>
<p>It makes sense that theists would avoid murder because they know they’ll be accountable. But I don’t understand why atheists would condemn killing. Animals kill each other (not only in the case of predators and prey) and since we’re all just animals, what’s wrong with us killing each other?</p>
<p>Feelings of pity or sympathy should be unreasonable by atheist standards. Why should you help someone who’s suffering? You’re not going to be rewarded for it and you’re only ever going to waste wealth and effort on them. So if you’re only doing it for the self-satisfaction of your emotions (which is pretty selfish by the way) then you may as well believe in god to satisfy a bunch of other emotions.</p>

How is it not justifiable when you are at war? There is no difference between throwing a grenade at your enemy to kill them and strapping a bomb to yourself at walking over to your enemy.</p>

I think you have wrongfully likened that to the London bombings or other situations. The only situations where it is justified is when the targets are enemy combatants etc. The deliberate targeting of civilians is not permissible in Islam.</p>
<p>There have been situations like the London bombings where certain people have distorted Islamic principles to justify what is clearly against Islam. Islam does not allow the murder of innocent civilians period.</p>
<p>An example of a situation where suicide bombing maybe seen as justified is where the Iraqi resistance drove trucks filled with explosives into American bases. Again, in Iraq there were also cases where there were suicide bombings in markets which I assert you is completely against Islam.</p>

<p>Perhaps I misunderstood, I thought we were referring to Muslims suicide bombing innocent civilians. Of course suicide bombing an army base can be justified.</p>

<p>Suicide bombing isn’t justifiable by any means, but it is a tactic in guerrilla warfare, and it’s not going anywhere.<br>

How is it not justifiable when you are at war? There is no difference between throwing a grenade at your enemy to kill them and strapping a bomb to yourself at walking over to your enemy.</p>
<p>Also what do you mean it’s not going anywhere. WAT?[/quote]<br>
Nevermind, I forgot I was talking to someone from England. Your methods are exterminate at all cost, always have been always will be.</p>
