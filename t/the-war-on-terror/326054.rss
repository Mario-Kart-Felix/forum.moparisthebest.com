    <title>The war on terror?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-war-on-terror/326054</link>
    <description>Well, after the CIA topic in the news section; it raised a very interesting point, and it showed some potential. I&#39;m just curious as to how many people think it is a justified war, their views on the war, if America should of invaded, etc.

My personal opinion:
I don&#39;t agree with a lot of the war. I hate the fact that America is leading the war effort; they are a terrible country to lead when it comes to warfare. They make terrible decisions, such as invading Afghanistan. The Taliban had offered to prosecute Ladin, but America wanted democracy. However, I do agree with some aspects of the war. Something had to be done, but not by the Americans.

So, what is your views?</description>

Probably true. It’s not like they/we can really defeat the Taliban. We’re just fighting a war which is getting nowhere lool</p>

Name one suicide bombing which hasn’t killed civilians? Also, you have a dig at me when I stereotype you because of your military activity from a century ago, yet British people constantly refer to Australians as criminals. That was 2 centuries ago, and you won’t let that go.<br>

Yes… That’s exactly my point. War isn’t justifiable because it kills innocent civilians, nor is suicide bombing.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>[quote=“yakman, post:28, topic:326054”]I’ll try to reduce the size of the post.</p>
<p>I agree that Palestinian youth seeing their mothers dying is a contributing factor to suicide bombing, but we must not forget that these young men are prohibited from contact with women, sex is forbidden until marriage and masturbation is condemned. Its not healthy to deny your own sexuality like this and I think its very plausible that these sexual deprived young adults find the promise of 72 virgins absolutely irresistible.<br>
I can’t see how a non-believer of sound mind would want to kill themselves, because for them death is the end. For theists, the word “suicide” is wrong, you don’t lose you life when the bomb explodes, you’re still alive in heaven.</p>
<p>We also must remember the actual reason there is conflict in the Holy Land. The Abrahamic religions ultimately caused the divisions that lead to the weapon of religion being used.</p>
<p>Atheism technically doesn’t have any doctrines, its simply a statement of lack of belief.<br>
Sympathy is a part of human nature, atheists and theists alike feel it because they are all human. Unless you’re a psychopath, you’ll find its hard to know of another person suffering without feeling pity. I don’t see why “making the most of life” means you have to not bother with charity.</p>
<p>According to the Red Cross <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=87855" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, the emblem is ultimately taken from the Christian cross, however they doesn’t see Christianity as important, this shows because they also use a Red Crescent and Red Crystal in areas where the people might not be friendly to Christians or Muslims. The site says clearly that “Neither emblem has any religious or political significance.” It shows that the Red Cross care more about saving lives then spreading <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=86767" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">religion</a>.[/quote]</p>
<p>You’ve wrongfully accused suicide bombers of doing what they do because they want to have sex. That’s outright ridiculous because they could have all the sex they want had they chosen to stay alive. All it would take is for them to be married and that isn’t really an obstacle. In fact, if it was their main motive to have sex then it would have been more practical for them to stay alive because they’d only have the reward of the 72 virgins after judgement day - which if they’d chosen to stay alive, they could have sex both in this life and the next.</p>
<p>Unlike atheists, theists are at peace with the fact that whether they like it or not, in the end they will die.</p>
<p>‘I can’t see how a non-believer of sound mind would want to kill themselves, because for them death is the end’<br>
In the example I mentioned earlier, where the boy watched his mother die in his own hands, had he been an atheist don’t you think he still would be motivated to do so? As far as I’m concerned, anyone with a sound mind would want to retaliate and cause the maximum damage possible.</p>
<p>You spoke of the conflict between the Abrahamic religions in the holly land as if they all intend to kill each other. You can’t blame all three religions for the actions of their people (because no one can represent a religion perfectly). Let’s take the crusades for example. The Christians massacred Muslims and destroyed their mosques. When Saladin took back Jerusalem, he didn’t kill a single Christian, he even allowed many to stay. So just because there’s conflict in the region, it doesn’t mean that all religion is false and all they bring is death.</p>
<p>It makes sense that theists would avoid murder because they know they’ll be accountable. But I don’t understand why atheists would condemn killing. Animals kill each other (not only in the case of predators and prey) and since we’re all just animals, what’s wrong with us killing each other?</p>
<p>Feelings of pity or sympathy should be unreasonable by atheist standards. Why should you help someone who’s suffering? You’re not going to be rewarded for it and you’re only ever going to waste wealth and effort on them. So if you’re only doing it for the self-satisfaction of your emotions (which is pretty selfish by the way) then you may as well believe in god to satisfy a bunch of other emotions.</p>

              <p>[quote=“yakman, post:33, topic:326054”]akl, you are very wrong, ignorant and mistaken. Here is why.</p>
<p>Firstly, you contradicts yourself. You say “The Qu’ran forbids any act of suicide and strongly condems it.”, but then in a later post you say that suicide is okay because its the only feasable option. I agree the suicide bombers are brave, their religion gives them almost superhuman courage. They dont need to fear death as its not the end, they only look forward to an eternaty in heaven and 72 virgins.<br>
Furthermore, you missed my point with that which was that you cant explain why your interpretation of Islam is better then anybody elses who says Muslims should be suicide bombers.[/quote]<br>
You misinterpret what ever I said. In certain circumstances the only way out of it or to defend oneself is to kill yourself or in other words, sacrifice yourself in order to protect others.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:33, topic:326054”]There are many many ex-muslims, its simply wrong to say that its impossible to leave Islam. See some of their websites.<br>
<a href="http://www.ex-muslim.org.uk/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ex-muslim.org.uk/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.apostatesofislam.com/apostates.htm" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.apostatesofislam.com/apostates.htm</a><br>
<a href="http://bibleprobe.com/islamapostates.htm%5B/quote%5D" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://bibleprobe.com/islamapostates.htm[/quote]</a><br>
I believe I used the word theoretically. I did not mention the possibility of it being impossible. Obviously you can leave Islam.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:33, topic:326054”]Furthermore, feeding women at proper times does not constitute treating them equally to men.<br>
The women have to be covered, why dont men cover themselves either? Men can have more the one wife but women cannot have more then one husband.[/quote]<br>
That part was directed at how women are treated in an Islamic society considering the fact that she was a <span class="bbcode-b">hostage</span>.<br>
I’ll look into why men don’t cover themselves and get back to you.</p>
<p>[quote=“yakman, post:33, topic:326054”]Islam’s views on homosexuality are bigoted and homophobic.<br>
Its wrong to say that there exist no homosexual muslims. Here is a link to one who tried to re-interpret the Quran.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Muslim+Edmonton+scholar+pariah+religious+community/2401734/story.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Muslim+Edmonton+scholar+pariah+religious+community/2401734/story.html</a></p>
<p>[quote]EDMONTON — Junaid Bin Jahangir was such a devout Muslim that when he arrived in Canada he ate only yogurt for two days until he was sure which food followed halal dietary rules.<br>
The university student prayed five times a day, and joined a local mosque.<br>
Then one day, at age 27, he started to wonder why he had never been with a girl. “Why don’t I like women that way?” he asked, and it led him to a counselling office, where he sat, sobbing, with the realization that he was gay — a pariah in his own community.<br>
Mainstream Islamic leaders say gay men should be shunned and some around the world are killed each year.[/quote][/quote]<br>
Well, like I said, I never heard of a man being gay in Islam but I’ll have to read up on this and respond to it.</p>

</aside>
<p>My interpretations can be wrong and so can the Islamic leaders as Islam is such a huge religion that people all around the world, Muslims or non-Muslims, twist the laws and beliefs of Islam to suit/justify their needs. The best you can do is sought resort to buying a translation of the Holy Qu’ran and read it. But I’m sure you wouldn’t do that, not that I mean it in an offending manner but just that it won’t do you any good.</p>

              <p>akl, you are very wrong, ignorant and mistaken. Here is why.</p>
<p>Firstly, you contradicts yourself. You say “The Qu’ran forbids any act of suicide and strongly condems it.”, but then in a later post you say that suicide is okay because its the only feasable option. I agree the suicide bombers are brave, their religion gives them almost superhuman courage. They dont need to fear death as its not the end, they only look forward to an eternaty in heaven and 72 virgins.<br>
Furthermore, you missed my point with that which was that you cant explain why your interpretation of Islam is better then anybody elses who says Muslims should be suicide bombers.</p>
<p>There are many many ex-muslims, its simply wrong to say that its impossible to leave Islam. See some of their websites.<br>
<a href="http://www.ex-muslim.org.uk/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ex-muslim.org.uk/</a><br>
<a href="http://www.apostatesofislam.com/apostates.htm" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.apostatesofislam.com/apostates.htm</a><br>
<a href="http://bibleprobe.com/islamapostates.htm" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://bibleprobe.com/islamapostates.htm</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, feeding women at proper times does not constitute treating them equally to men.<br>
The women have to be covered, why dont men cover themselves either? Men can have more the one wife but women cannot have more then one husband.</p>
<p>There is also justification from scripture.</p>
<blockquote>    * A woman is worth one-half a man. 2:282 ; and males are to inherit twice that of females. 4:11
    *Men are in charge of women, because Allah made men to be better than women. Refuse to have sex with women from whom you fear rebellion, and scourge them. 4:34
    * Lewd women are to be confined to their houses until death. 4:15
    * You can't have sex with married women, unless they are slaves obtained in war (with whom you may rape or do whatever you like). 4:24
    * Don't pray if you are drunk, dirty, or have touched a woman lately. 4:43
    * A husband can accuse his wife of adultery with only one witness. 24:6</blockquote>
<p>Islam’s views on homosexuality are bigoted and homophobic.<br>
Its wrong to say that there exist no homosexual muslims. Here is a link to one who tried to re-interpret the Quran.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Muslim+Edmonton+scholar+pariah+religious+community/2401734/story.html" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Muslim+Edmonton+scholar+pariah+religious+community/2401734/story.html</a></p>
<blockquote>EDMONTON — Junaid Bin Jahangir was such a devout Muslim that when he arrived in Canada he ate only yogurt for two days until he was sure which food followed halal dietary rules.
The university student prayed five times a day, and joined a local mosque.
Then one day, at age 27, he started to wonder why he had never been with a girl. "Why don't I like women that way?" he asked, and it led him to a counselling office, where he sat, sobbing, with the realization that he was gay — a pariah in his own community.
Mainstream Islamic leaders say gay men should be shunned and some around the world are killed each year.</blockquote>
<p>SO in conclusion, you’re wrong and ignorant of your own religion. And I would very much like if you could explain <span class="bbcode-i">why you believe that all other interpretations of Islam are wrong except for yours.</span></p>
<p>Also, this thread has been mildly off topic for two pages now, dont try to claim that my post was off topic as an excuse for not answering any points.</p>

There’s where you get it wrong.<br>
Muslim scholars around the Middle-East justify the suicide attacks against the Americans (or any foreign force there for that matter) as it is an act of retaliation and that these Muslims do not have arms or means of defense possible to defend themselves. The only feasible option of defending themselves and their families is to kill themselves through suicide. These men are considered brave and are also known to be martyrs.</p>

</aside>
<p>Theoretically, once you accept Islam, you cannot leave it. You cannot.<br>
Islam treats women with great respect in it’s society. Take the example of that women who was kidnapped by the Afghanistan Taliban. She said that they treated her with respect and harmony. They first gave her a piece of cloth to cover herself (as it is part of Islam that women should not reveal themselves extensively in the presence of men). She was fed at proper times. The man who brought her food did not look at her when he brought the food.<br>
Women are treated how they should be, not as sex symbols so as in some Western societies.</p>
<p>Homosexuality is not allowed in Islam as Islam believes that a man and a woman are together, a wheel that run life. If one is absent, the wheel is incomplete and hence life is incomplete. Also, for the human race to exist, reproduction is necessary and hence heterosexuality is allowed in Islam.<br>
Homosexuals are not frowned upon in Islamic societies as no Islamic man is a homosexual (I cannot recall an incident of one).</p>
<p>P.S - I am a Muslim.[/quote]</p>
<p>First of all, <span class="bbcode-b">suicide bombing</span> cannot be justified as a means to protest (retaliate). This is using other people as a means to and end(using people) which is not morally right, no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>Secondly why should you <span class="bbcode-b">treat women differently</span>? You say that it is right to treat them as objects and control what they can and can’t wear/do, you justify this by saying you treat them better than you would a man. It isn’t morally right to judge someone on who they are rather than what they do or have done. Also you say in Islam women are treated how they should be and that American women are wrong? How can you possibly say that, there are no global rules for this sort of thing. Your culture believes one thing, western cultures believe a different thing. Leave us alone.</p>
<p>Thirdly <span class="bbcode-b">homosexuality</span> has nothing to do with reproducing. In ancient Greece a lot of the men had homosexual relations and still fathered children with women so you can’t justify that homosexuals are bad because it kills the human race.</p>
<p>Finally how the fuck can you justify trying to fuck up other cultures? Different cultures believe different things and you have no right to influence another cultures beliefs. You live by your culture, I live by mine. There is absolutely no point in suicide bombing to push your shitty religion onto me.</p>
<p>I think this is the first time I’ve raged this much.</p>

<p>This is an odd thing about religion. If you have a disagreement in science, you do an experiment to see who’s right. If you have a disagreement in government, you have a debate and vote to see what should be done.<br>
But if you have two rival interpretations of religion, what do you do? There seems to be no test, people who say “the other side has simply got it wrong” are very unconvincing.</p>
<p>It seems people just take the religion of their parents. They are Muslim because they were born in the middle-east, but they would probably be Christian if they were born in America.</p>

Please read the Holy Qu’ran before you make any comments.<br>
The Qu’ran forbids any act of suicide and strongly condems it. In Islam, there is no place for a suicide bomber or anyone who has committed suicide. Islam also does not allow Muslims to involve its self in war. Muslims are only allowed to get involved in war if the war is in direct conflict of our beliefs, i.e we are allowed to defend ourselves. Islam is a peaceful religion but it’s been so hyped up with the war against terror that many around the world link terrorism to Islam. That is wrong.<br>
We also do not allow the killings of other humans and believers of other religions. The reason why the growth of Islam has been great is because Islam tends to attract believers and converts by the way of it’s living, it’s compassion and it’s love. It doesn’t influence war or acts of crime.</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H) was inflicted with great pain and despair in his life, but he never prayed to Allah for the killing of the Jews and other people who did not believe in Islam. He told all the Muslims that they should be compassionate and follow the true ethics of the religion. Islam builds a society of trust and love.<br>
In fact, he would write to other leaders of different religions, have talks with them too.<br>
Islam is not a forceful religion, actually we’ve been told to mould our character in such a way that believers of other religions would recognize what kind of religion Islam is and convert to Islam is.</p>
<p>I can’t believe how you could base your ideas that Islam allows suicide bombings and of such.</p>

              <p>I’ll try to reduce the size of the post.</p>
<p>I agree that Palestinian youth seeing their mothers dying is a contributing factor to suicide bombing, but we must not forget that these young men are prohibited from contact with women, sex is forbidden until marriage and masturbation is condemned. Its not healthy to deny your own sexuality like this and I think its very plausible that these sexual deprived young adults find the promise of 72 virgins absolutely irresistible.<br>
I can’t see how a non-believer of sound mind would want to kill themselves, because for them death is the end. For theists, the word “suicide” is wrong, you don’t lose you life when the bomb explodes, you’re still alive in heaven.</p>
<p>We also must remember the actual reason there is conflict in the Holy Land. The Abrahamic religions ultimately caused the divisions that lead to the weapon of religion being used.</p>
<p>Atheism technically doesn’t have any doctrines, its simply a statement of lack of belief.<br>
Sympathy is a part of human nature, atheists and theists alike feel it because they are all human. Unless you’re a psychopath, you’ll find its hard to know of another person suffering without feeling pity. I don’t see why “making the most of life” means you have to not bother with charity.</p>
<p>According to the Red Cross <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=87855" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, the emblem is ultimately taken from the Christian cross, however they doesn’t see Christianity as important, this shows because they also use a Red Crescent and Red Crystal in areas where the people might not be friendly to Christians or Muslims. The site says clearly that “Neither emblem has any religious or political significance.” It shows that the Red Cross care more about saving lives then spreading <a href="http://www.redcross.org.uk/standard.asp?id=86767" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">religion</a>.</p>

<p>An ideology will push someone to blow up himself and everyone around him. I won’t say that there won’t be any Atheists that will do so, but history shows that 98% (rough guesstimate) of the suicide bombings was done by someone with a radical religious background. The media will jump to conclusions when a Muslim does so, but they’ll say it was done by a lunatic when they find evidence of Christian extremism.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think the reason that most, if not all, suicide attacks are committed by people of religions is that pretty much all the conflicts of the world involve people of religions. The only role religion plays in this is that it tells people to defend themselves even at the expense of their own lives. Suicide bombing obviously wasn’t specifically mentioned in any religious texts, and so it’s justification must have been the result of someone distorting religious principles.</p>
<p>Of course in this case I’m talking about suicide bombing that intentionally results in the death of civilians.</p>

<p>Suicide bombings can also be an act of despair, but most of the bombers believe that they are doing a good thing, and will be rewarded for that in the afterlife. For Atheists, there is no afterlife, so only when such an act is reasonable, they’ll do so.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Well as I mentioned in an earlier post, it’s pointless defending religion as a whole (due to the diversity of the religions of the world) but when it comes to the Muslims who justify the murder of innocent civilians, they do so after distorting religious texts according to their own whims. That being said, suicide bombings that involve the the deliberate targetting of civilians aren’t exactly very numerous.</p>

<p>That’s why I said, had they truly believed they would be accountable, they wouldn’t have put the world through this. It feels like they’d adopted an atheist attitude of no accountability and so let’s go for it.</p>
<p>Anyway I feel our discussion is going a bit too off course. I would rather not debate faith or atheism because there are many people on this forum that I respect who happen to be atheists. The topic is about the ‘war on terror’ so let’s try and discuss that.</p>
