<p>My personal opinion:<br>
I don’t agree with a lot of the war. I hate the fact that America is leading the war effort; they are a terrible country to lead when it comes to warfare. They make terrible decisions, such as invading Afghanistan. The Taliban had offered to prosecute Ladin, but America wanted democracy. However, I do agree with some aspects of the war. Something had to be done, but not by the Americans.</p>
<p>So, what is your views?</p>

<p>Coming to think of it, 9/11 was a reaction to decades of oppression at the hands of the USA (or so they claim). Irrespective of the perpetrators’ religion, I think the attacks were inevitable. Sure, a group of people twisted religious ideologies to justify the attacks but in the end they did it because they were oppressed. That is of course, assuming that it was who we’re told it was. Don’t blame religion, blame the USA.</p>

<p>The Taliban are misunderstood by America. I think the Taliban had a noble cause when it was formed, but resorted to tactics that were less than moral. They didn’t come to fight, they came to win against the invaders. So using tactics such as IEDs, Sleepers, Guerrilla warfare was all they really had to rely on. Sure there is some illegal activity taking place, the distribution and manufacture of opium, etc. But they have to fund the war somehow.</p>

Coming to think of it, 9/11 was a reaction to decades of oppression at the hands of the USA (or so they claim). Irrespective of the perpetrators’ religion, I think the attacks were inevitable. Sure, a group of people twisted religious ideologies to justify the attacks but in the end they did it because they were oppressed. That is of course, assuming that it was who we’re told it was. Don’t blame religion, blame the USA.[/quote]</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for religion, you couldn’t convince anybody to kill themselves like that. According to religious doctrine, you don’t really die!<br>
Religion is a weapon. Authorities can use it to control people. As long as you listen to your Iman, you will be rewarded. Outcomes like your own death, which would put off any rational person don’t matter to a devout religious person.</p>
<p>Also, the situation in Isreal and Palastine motivated the use of this terrible weapon in the first place. It takes somebody really irrational to fight over an area of desert the size of Wales.</p>
<p>The west is only interested in the middle-east because of oil. If it wasn’t for religion there could be peace built upon good relations with trading oil. Like there is now between the US and Saudi Arabia. But irrational religious people have to go fuck it up. (Both sides are guilty of this)</p>

<p>YOU ARE WAFFLING SHIT, you have to be severely disturbed to commit suicide whether you are religious or not. Being Atheist would not be a contributing factor to whether you are going to kill yourself or not. I don’t feel like there’s no point in living because I don’t think there is a god, thats stupid. It’s human nature to preserve ones life.</p>
<p>And btw, can we stop defending the Taliban in this thread? They are harsh to their people, oppressing women and refusing young girls education. I acknowledge that this is their culture and we shouldn’t intervene but they aren’t exactly the good guys in this war. No one is.</p>

Religion is a weapon. Authorities can use it to control people. As long as you listen to your Iman, you will be rewarded. Outcomes like your own death, which would put off any rational person don’t matter to a devout religious person.[/quote]<br>
With that logic, you can easily convince any atheist to kill themselves too. Let’s say around 60% of the world live in poverty, had they been atheists, they should all just kill themselves because they’re not going to be accountable for that anyway. In fact, anyone who doesn’t have a good life should just kill themselves.</p>
<p>So even if the 9/11 hijackers were atheists, if a country had oppressed their people to a great enough extent, being atheist isn’t going to stop them from killing many of that country’s people. Especially since their not going to be accountable for that anyway.</p>

<p>YOU ARE WAFFLING SHIT, you have to be severely disturbed to commit suicide whether you are religious or not. Being Atheist would not be a contributing factor to whether you are going to kill yourself or not. I don’t feel like there’s no point in living because I don’t think there is a god, thats stupid. It’s human nature to preserve ones life.</p>
<p>And btw, can we stop defending the Taliban in this thread? They are harsh to their people, oppressing women and refusing young girls education. I acknowledge that this is their culture and we shouldn’t intervene but they aren’t exactly the good guys in this war. No one is.[/quote]<br>
If you read the post correctly, MujaheD clearly pointed out that if yakman followed that logic, the athiests could also me convinced the same way. Read again.</p>

<p>You clearly didn’t understand my argument, I doubt if you even read it.</p>
<p>As religious people believe, without any evidence, in an afterlife. What happens in this life is nothing compared to the next one. So it doesn’t matter if you die in this life because you’ll wake up again, and many doctrines assert that you’ll actually be rewarded in the next life.</p>
<p>As atheists don’t believe in an afterlife, they are excluded from this irrationality. This is the only life we’ve got and we want to make the most of it, not commit suicide over some ideology.</p>
<p>There have been other countries that have been oppressed, and they liberated themselves not through religious violence, but through peaceful means and it was more successful.</p>
<p>Look at the example of India, its first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was an atheist. He and Gandhi freed their country through civil disobedience and talks with the British government.<br>
Despite the secular protest movement, there was still the rot and India was partitioned on religious grounds into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan, which resulted in half a million deaths.</p>

<p>Way to go. Make all the oil radioactive. Destroy the roads, airstrips and docks. Kill all the possible workers. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/expressionlessae52.png?v=5" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>
<p>Contrary to what you think, not everybody is out to get you. You need to stop your victim mentality.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental principles of capitalism is that if everybody has the freedom to trade, everyone will be better off. In this example, if the west and the middle-east could trade freely they would settle on an equilibrium with the west getting the oil it wants and the middle-east getting money.<br>
I’ve already pointed out the example of good trade between the US and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>You keep trying to say that religious people are somehow more moral then atheists because they feel they are accountable to God.<br>
To me, this is not morality if you only do good because you expect to be rewarded in heaven. Atheists do good for goodness sake, because society is a nicer place if everyone is good.</p>
<p>tl;dr if only more people were not religious, there would be less suffering in the world.</p>
