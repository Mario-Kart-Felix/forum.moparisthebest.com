    <title>Thoughts on the Dice Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/thoughts-on-the-dice-game/420827</link>
    <description>Recently became interested in this so I&#39;m going to throw out some theory and if there is anything wrong with my math/thinking let me know. Wish these forums had more support for mathematical symbols but bear with me.

Tools: I used wolframalpha because some bitch stole my TI89. A calculator with basic probability functions will do. A TI84 would do just fine. Otherwise, you can calculate it by hand but it&#39;d be a pain.

[u][b]Quick Background[/b][/u]
Runescape players wager a bet and throw a virtual 100 sided die. If the outcome is &gt;= 60, the player wins double their wager. Otherwise, the dice host keeps the wager.

[u][b]Foundation[/b][/u]

[b]Problem A[/b]
What can we expect the outcome of a single trial/throw of the die to be i.e. what is the average/mean?

[b]Solution[/b]
Let S = {1, 2, ..., 100} (The set of all possible outcomes of a trial i.e. the sample space)

Let Y be a random variable denoting the value of a single throw of the die. and let y represent a single value in Y.

Then the expectation of Y, E[Y] = summation(y*p(y)) where p(y) = probability mass function = 1/100 (we assume the die to be fair.)

[u]Therefore, on average, we expect a single throw of the die to produce a value of 50.5  Which is close to what intuition suggests.[/u]

[b]Problem B[/b]
What is the standard of deviation?

[b]Solution[/b]
The standard of deviation is nothing but the square root of the variance of Y, V[Y].
V[Y] = E[Y[sup]2[/sup]] - (E[Y])[sup]2[/sup]
E[Y[sup]2[/sup]] = summation(y[sup]2[/sup]p(y)) = 3383.5 (I don&#39;t have my calculator, but I&#39;ll edit this post later)
(E[Y])[sup]2[/sup] = 2500
V[Y] = sqrt(3383.5 - 2500) = 29.7237

[u]Therefore the standard of deviation is 29. By the empirical rule, we can expect 68% of the outcomes to lie within +-29 of the mean/average of Y, 95% to lie within 2*(+-29) of the mean, and most/all of them to lie within 3*(+-29) of the mean.[/u]


[u][b]The Dice Game as a Binomial Experiment[/b][/u]
We can view the dice game as an experiment consisting of n independent trials (the result of one trial does not affect a previous one) with only two outcomes: You either win or you lose.

Let Y be a random variable denoting the number of successes in n trials.

[b]Problem A[/b]
What is the probability of 1 success in 5 throws of the die?

[b]Solution[/b]
Since we assume binomial distribution
The probability of 1 success in 5 throws of the die = P(Y=r) = binompdf(n, p, r)
where n = the number of trials, p is the probability of success, and r is the number of successes we want to observe.

The probability of success is nothing but the outcome you want (the outcome of a throw to be &gt;= 60) divided by the total possible outcomes (the sample space). So p = 40/100 = .4 or 40%

Therefore P(Y=1) = binompdf(5, .4, 1) = .2592

[u]Therefore the probability that you will win exactly once in 5 throws of the die is 25.92%[/u]

[b]Problem B[/b]
What is the probability that you will win at least once in 5 throws of the die.

[b]Solution[/b]
This is a bit trickier.
The probability that you&#39;ll win at least once in 5 throws = P(Y &gt;= 1) = 1 - the probability that you won&#39;t win = 1 - P(Y = 0) = 1 - binompdf(5, .4, 0) = 1 - .07776 = .92224 = 92.224%

[u]Therefore the probability that you win at least one time in 5 throws of the die is approximately 92%[/u]

Feel free to tweak numbers. What is the probability that you&#39;ll win at least once in 10 throws of the die? 100?

[u][b]The Dice Game as a Poisson Experiment[/b][/u]
We&#39;ve looked at the dice game as a binomial experiment previously but one thing that might bug you is the high percentages we achieve e.g. a 92% chance you&#39;ll win at least once in 5 throws of the die. Shouldn&#39;t all the players be rich and all dice hosts go broke?

Well... yes and no.

Our math should be right (correct me if i&#39;m wrong) but the problem is that we need a distribution that more closely models the experiment. If we had more information, we could make better guesses. In fact, we can add one more piece of information... time!

[b]Conceptualizing the problem[/b]
Suppose we had a time interval of 1 hour and, during that hour, we could throw a die at any point in time. Now suppose that, on average, we&#39;d have 30 tosses in an hour of tossing the die.

Now take that interval of 1 hour and cut it in half. Suppose that we now have, on average, 10 tosses.

Now take that subinterval of 30min and cut it in half so on and so forth until you can only throw the die once for some arbitrarily small subinterval. That means during that subinterval, you only have one of two possibilities. Win or lose. Sound familiar?

If you guessed binomial, you&#39;re right!

[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]
I&#39;m currently looking at determining a good value for the lambda parameter to calculate probabilities using Poisson distribution.

I&#39;d solve this by writing a bot that constantly tosses the die and records wins/losses over time but, unfortunately, all bots are down and I&#39;m not doing it by hand. So the Poisson section will have to wait.

I wish I had been interested in this weeks ago. One thing that would be extremely useful would be to plot the wins/losses over time with a bot and graph it. Doing so would allow you to easily see if the distribution is indeed Binomial/Poisson. Theory is only useful up to a certain point.

Any thoughts/insights/corrections?
Can you confirm some of this theory, or do you think Jagex&#39;s &quot;die&quot; (PRNG) is biased?</description>

<p>Eh, I guess I could replace it with a geometric representation of the problem i.e. treat each trial as a Bernoulli trial and compute the probability that you’ll get a successful throw on the nth trial.</p>
