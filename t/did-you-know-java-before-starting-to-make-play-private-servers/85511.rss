    <title>Did you know JAVA before starting to make/play private servers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/did-you-know-java-before-starting-to-make-play-private-servers/85511</link>
    <description>I know this isn&#39;t the correct place, but there isn&#39;t any where else to post it while it still being about p&#39;servers.

So the question is, Did you know Java before starting to make private servers?

My self I am just now learning java in the last few weeks. Its currently my 2nd programming language (not including html, php, online coding etc.)


I am betting only a small percentage actually knew it before it.

TBH, most server owners don&#39;t know java i have realized. (I didn&#39;t know it when i was a server owner lmfao)</description>

              <p><em>Sighs</em>… Ya, I pretty much just new the basics. Just strings, classes, ints, voids, booleans, and most to the beginner’s knowledge.</p>
<p>I became more experienced at it by a lot of testing. But to do it, I always made a back-up of my <span class="bbcode-i">client.java</span>, and would just experiment anything I could possibly imagine. Most of my codes didn’t work, but I came around some of the times, and they soon just became accustomed to me. I don’t really spend all that time on my server anymore, but learning more of Java is something I can plan on doing in the future.</p>
