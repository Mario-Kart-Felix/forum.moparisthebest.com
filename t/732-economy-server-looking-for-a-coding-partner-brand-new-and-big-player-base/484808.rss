    <description>Hey guys, I am looking for a coding partner for my 718/732 server. It is about 3 weeks old, although I have been coding this project for months, and has a player base of about 10+ online all the time and reaching 30 on weekends. We have a .com domain, a sweet website, a nice forums, a high powered vps, and loyal players. The reason I am looking for a coding partner is that on weekdays I can barely make it on with school, sports, and homework. I need someone to help me provide daily updates for this server, which I can code a ton on the weekends, not to mention February break starts in a few days. I am looking for someone unique, I don&#39;t want someone who can only copy and paste tutorials and snippets. Our players can think of unique things to add on the server, most of which I can add, although since I don&#39;t have all the time in the world I am lookng for someone to help me with that. If you are interested in coding the server with me please add my skype: mabrox97
I don&#39;t want this server to be &quot;just another Matrix server&quot;, I want this to be unique. This will take hard work but I am motivated by my players to make this one of the best 732 ECONOMY, yes spawn servers are boring as fuck, out there. Hopefully I can find an experienced coder who is as motivated as me to grow a huge server.</description>
