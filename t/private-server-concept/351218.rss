    <title>Private server concept</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/private-server-concept/351218</link>
    <description>I read [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,447196]this[/url] thread and thought that it was a brilliant idea. If the server was actually completed, it would undoubtedly be an interesting one.

I came up with a few ideas, for myself, based on that server in development and the following is what I have come up with.

When a new account is made, the player is made a Lumbridge citizen. Lumbridge will be ranked as the lowest city in the game. He has two choices: be loyal or betray the city. If he remains loyal, he can earn city points (the higher one has, the higher prestige his rank [b]in the city[/b]). On the other hand, if he chooses to betray, he will have to go to another city/town, replace its citizenship by talking to an NPC and return to his original city, kill the NPCs there and wreak havoc (this earns your city points). You can only kill NPCs if you were once part of their city.

There can be more ideas for this, but this is just all at the moment. I was inspired by this thread, so have a look: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,447196</description>

<p>How is it hard? People won’t stay in a city because they can apply for citizenship of another city.</p>
