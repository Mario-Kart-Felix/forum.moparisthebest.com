    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-need-help-with-far-casting-and-far-ranging-few-other-things-562/356563</link>
    <description>[size=10pt]1.I am wanting to know where it is possible to Far cast magics and fire range from a distance instead of being restricted to 1 space and if it is possible would someone kindly tell how to do this for all magics and range equiptment.

2. If anyone has the full set of working spell for each spell book (Modern, Ancient and Lunar) and a tutorial on how to add the spells would be great.

3. If anyone has a tutorial on how to add items into the 562 server.

4.If anyone has the files and a tutorial on adding a working Grand Exchange that is only accessed from the g.e area.

5.If anybody has the new curse prayers with a tutorial on adding them.

If you have any of these items mentioned please leave a comment and link.
Your contributions will be greatly appretiated.
And Finally i Thank you in advance[/size] ;D</description>
