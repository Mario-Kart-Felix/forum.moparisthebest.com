    <title>[RESOLVED - ADDED] &quot;Skype Username&quot; to Profile</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-added-skype-username-to-profile/530655</link>
    <description>So there is AIM, YIM, and MSN fields to put in your email or username for them. I know this forum is outdated, but even the current SMF update doesn&#39;t have a skype field in there. There should be a spot to put your skype there for the people who wish to. MSN doesn&#39;t even exist anymore, except for Silab because she is in China and IDK if AIM or YIM even exists. Never used them.

Just think it would be a cool little addition.</description>

              <p>I’ve gone ahead and added this now. If you wish to add your Skype to your Moparscape profile simply navigate to your profile and hit “Forum profile” and you can change the contents of the Skype field. You can search for other members using their Skype names as well.</p>
