    <title>614 Client wont start?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/614-client-wont-start/398279</link>
    <description>Well first off this is where i got my base from:[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,452322.0.html]http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,452322.0.html[/url]

And I tried asking for help from the topic but no one responded. I have the server portforwarded and I have the ip set, and i have the cache set. But this is what happens. [IMG]http://i55.tinypic.com/2h30vb7.png[/img] It just does that and i don&#39;t know why. I have tried doing it on other 614/562 clients but nothing seems to work at all, i don&#39;t understand why this won&#39;t work. if you can help me i will give rep of course</description>

              <p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:3, topic:398279”]Their MAY be a anti-leach. If you can’t find it try searching(ctrl + f) ‘ip’ or ‘server’ untill you find like something that has a bracket which looks like it needs a value put in. Its a simple way of stopping people leaching a server people search no-ip etc.</p>
<p>If not try a different client with it, also check the ports on the server and client are the same i.e. i’ve changed mines to 5555 just search 43594 (most commonly used) is both the source and client.</p>
<p>Hope this helped :)[/quote]</p>
<p>Still didn’t work, it did help I really want to work with a 562+ but there just simply isn’t enough sources out there that work. I guess ill see what i can do.</p>
