    <description>I&#39;ve changed my life drastically religious-wise and mostly educational-wise. I have received a scholarship last for any college that has the field Science and Technology in it and I am really proud of what I have recieved because I&#39;m still in the 8th grade. When I usually play COD these days, I feel really sad and I have this feeling in my heart as if I&#39;m destroying my future. I have nothing to do really these days studying-wise. So, is there anything that I could do to occupy my time educationally other than wasting my time on my PS3? Or is there a solution for the feeling I have?

Thanks,
Seif</description>

<p>Most scholarships you have to be in highschool for, but some of them don’t have age restrictions.  (I have a book with TONS of scholarships).</p>

              <p>You can get a head start on your college education once you’re in highschool and 16. I’m doing it and it is very beneficial… I’m on a grant, and I don’t have to pay anything till I’m out of school. I’m aiming high in the medical field, and money is going to be an issue. Better to get 4 free years out of the way.</p>
<p>Talk to a councilor about DUEL, JOINT, and ACCEL enrollment. They will have papers for you. Depending on your school curriculum, you can take replacement classes instead of attending school at all. I can’t do that but I know several that do and its real sweet considering that they all schedule them all at night. If you do this, I’d look into going into a technical college first… way more relaxed.</p>
