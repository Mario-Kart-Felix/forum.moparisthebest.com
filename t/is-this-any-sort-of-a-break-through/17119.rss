    <title>Is this any sort of a break through?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-this-any-sort-of-a-break-through/17119</link>
    <description>This may be a step closer to duping if it isn&#39;t discovered yet. CE 5.0 is used to edit money for screenies and that is all so far. People claimed that only stackable items were able to be edited. They were wrong. I have 2000M stacked glories right now. Which isn&#39;t possible. They are not in note form, they are just stacked. This may be a step closer to duping because that proves that non-stackable items can be edited. If only someone could figure out a way to make the ammies appear one by one. Anyway, I figured out that every inventory slot has a different number also. Such as instead of having to edit objects one by one, you can just move another item into inventory slot one to get that number. If you don&#39;t understand listen. If you edited 1M cash to be 2000M cash and you did this while it was in the first inventory slot, if you moved another item into the first slot it would become 2000M and the item edited will return to its normal number. Well I just made this wondering if anyone has figured out this stuff yet. If they have, forgive me for the long post.</description>

              <p>I know exactly what it is, client side, what I am saying is that I made a nonstackable item more than 1. Sort of like client side duping but it stacked. Like it was a glory ammy but it said 2000M on the top like it was 2000M glories and it wasn’t in note form. I’m trying to say that there is probably a way to make items client side for temporary use. Like for instance, if you used a hex editor to make you have 2000M it isn’t really that much of course but it is actually there for you and can be examined etc. If there is a way to ‘spawn’ client side of course, even though it is client side it still may be able to be worn or used maybe.</p>
