              <p>At the moment, this topic is quite confusing. You wouldn’t really guess that it’s a development team until you read the last sentence. Could you please take a look at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,528465.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> topic and then edit your topic accordingly? I’ll have to lock this otherwise.</p>
