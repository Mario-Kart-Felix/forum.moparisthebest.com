    <title>Help with moving username</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-moving-username/227325</link>
    <description>I was wondering how to move the user name to the corner of the screen like the yellow box is, and bring the line down as well. :confused:

I was told to look into the client.java and look for something similar to,

&lt;blockquote&gt;you&#39;re looking for a method call, with a number, then an x coord, then a y coord 
so it&#39;d look like: method(12312, 500, 100  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
