[B]Introduction[/B]

VitalizePK is mainly a PKing server, although nearly all skills are working perfectly and all play their own part in the pking world. As this is mainly a pking server, there will be no need to train your combat skills, simply login and set your levels! Although, the server is a 317 loading 377 cache, there are custom items packed in, however we are not one of those servers that loads all the new animations and quite frankly, ugly hit splats. We still remain a mainly oldschool server with an oldschool feel, and the custom items that are in the game, are also hard to obtain.

VitalizePK is an oldschool based server. Any later RS content such as newer items such as the Dragon Defender is a challenge to obtain. We aim to keep a balance as such most people will be easily able to obtain basic oldschool pking items, barrows, non-spawnables (Fire Cape, Fighter  Torso, Rune defender) with ease and get pking, but the option is there for anyone whom puts the effort in to gain an advantage with more powerful items such as PVP armour. Those whom really show there dedication can access the ability to obtain the Tokhaar-Kal. 

Weapons like the Vesta&#39;s Longsword, Statius Warhammer and Dragon Claws are all fully functional within the server, we also have Dungeoneering items - &#39;Chaotics&#39; and Arcane Streams! Our client supports both &#39;new&#39; and &#39;old&#39; hits (X10) which can be toggled with the simple commands:- :: newhits or :: oldhits, depending on your style of play. If you enjoy hybridding, you&#39;ll enjoy VitalizePK. Item switching has been re-done and the combat system has been enhanced to account for the modern-day pker&#39;s needs.
