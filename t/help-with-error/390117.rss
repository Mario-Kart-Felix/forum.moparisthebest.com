    <title>Help with error</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-error/390117</link>
    <description>Ok so i have been for the past 3 days trying to find out how to fix the &quot;error_game_js5connect&quot; Error. So far i have been unsuccessful  :(. Anyhow so i am posting how do i fix it. People have told me some reasons it is doing it are: 

1.) Wrong IP address.
2.) Server is not online/Rune source first.
3.) Environmental Variables are not set

and i have made a host on no-ip.com and put that host name in the client.java file where it said &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; and i compiled, ran and it still didnt work. I dont know how to see if the server is online (i am new at this stuff) so idk what im doing there and i always make sure i run the Source first. I watched a vid on how to set EV so im pretty sure there good. BTW i have a 317 that is working just fine atm but this 562 keeps saying &quot;error_game_js5connect&quot;. The Client and stuff im using for the 562 is from &quot;Element-X&quot;. So does anyone have any suggestions whatsoever?!!?   (Also if needed i can teamview and i have msn)
THANKS, T A N K :cool:</description>
