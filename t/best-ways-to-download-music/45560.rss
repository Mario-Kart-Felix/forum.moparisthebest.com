    <title>Best Ways To Download Music</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-ways-to-download-music/45560</link>
    <description>hey,
most people already know some if these but for those that dont:

BITCOMET
[url=http://www.bitcomet.com/doc/download.htm]http://www.bitcomet.com/doc/download.htm[/url]
a good way to download whole albums in a fairly short time, the downloads start slow but as you connect to more people it gets faster.

MP3 SHITS
[url=http://www.mp3shits.com]www.mp3shits.com[/url]
i think its pronounced mp3&#39;s hits not mp3 shits. but ill call it mp3 shits anyway. get links to full albums or single songs which are uploaded on megaupload and other free filesharing websites.

LIMEWIRE PRO
[url=http://www.megaupload.com/?d=3DDWJEZQ]http://www.megaupload.com/?d=3DDWJEZQ[/url]
Probably good for downloading single songs not albums, to download an album with limewire you have to click every song and find out what the songs are etc. this is a pay version of limewire i just uploaded to megaupload.

APES
[url=http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net]http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net[/url]
the others are better for music but you can download some stuff with it, games which are on ares are usually compressed or whatever so the file ends up being less 1gig instead of 3 or 4 gig so the graphics arent as good as if you were to use bitcomet (for games)

if any of the links die just google it or tell me and ill upload it again.</description>

              <p>not single songs, it depends what torrent site you use for the file, some are really good and have a health bar.</p>
