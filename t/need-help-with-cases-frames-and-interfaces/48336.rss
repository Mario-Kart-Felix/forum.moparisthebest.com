    <title>Need Help With Cases, Frames, and Interfaces</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-cases-frames-and-interfaces/48336</link>
    <description>I&#39;m sort of new to MoparScape java programing but I have learned enough to start into harder things. I would like a small link to an explanation or a straight up forward explanation on these. Like, how to get a window to come up with possible smithing things on your level.

Can someone explain?

Thanks,
