Alright, as most of you know now, i am working on RSDW V3.
Due to my life apart from being a coder i don&#39;t find much time to code in general.

i hated how many bugs there were in my previous works, so i decided to throw it away and use the things i made that have proven usefull to a clean Drowning508 base, i will not edit the combat base anymore, just the game in general.
for those of you who still know my server, please send me some ideas for the new game and if you could a link to the long-lost 508 LD Fullscreen client.

note: a year ago now i got a new pc with a S-ATA  HDD and lost my old pc&#39;s HDD, recently i found it again and have backed up all files including my old base and servers which i tried, i will re-upload all of the ones i deem good enough to be revived.

if any of you know a 525 base and client that work properly please send me so i can make the server HD and LD within the same client, and ofcourse! More features^^

Anyway this has been demonwars i hope ti see some replies soon.
