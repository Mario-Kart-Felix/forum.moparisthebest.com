    <description>inb4 learn to code/stop programing

Okay here is the issue. I&#39;m trying to change the [PORT] of the server because i&#39;m already running a server on 43594.

I want to change the server port to 43595.

I have went into server.java and changed port to 43595.
Also, I have changed port in Loader.java Client sided to 43595.


I changed all ip address in loader.java, Client.java, and Gamestub.java to my server&#39;s port.


I even went into C:/Windows/System32/Drivers/etc/hosts.file to make 127.0.0.1 go with my no-ip.



I don&#39;t know why but it is staying at Checking for updates -1%.


I did put cache files in the data/cache/ folder, and when it didnt work, i used the one that game with the client and still no working option.



I think the server will work if i put it back to 43594, but I dont want to change the port on my main server.


can anyone help me solve this issue?</description>
