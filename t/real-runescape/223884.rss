    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/real-runescape/223884</link>
    <description>question one, does anyone have like the .i.p&#39;s for any of the REAL runescape worlds? 



question two, is it possible to obtain the current runescape client, in a java file like for example the same as the mopar client?
and if possible, can you change what .i.p it connects to?

if this is possible id like to exploit it as much as possible l0l..</description>
