    <title>My Errors connecting to servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-errors-connecting-to-servers/110211</link>
    <description>Hello, and thanks for reading. I am currently being disconnected from alot of servers, with the error message saying the server must be down. The thing is though, my friends are still on the servers, so I know it must be me. If anyone could help me with this, I would really appreciate it! ^_^</description>
