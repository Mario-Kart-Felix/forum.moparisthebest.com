              <p>[quote=“Fr33b1e, post:2, topic:65113”]1. Log in, log out, find your character file, then scroll down and look for skills, or just type ::master or ::pure when you become owner.<br>
2. Look at Melissa’s post and it should tell, or make some ways.<br>
3. Hamachi should eliminate some lag, but I think she said you need a strong computer to stop lag.<br>
4. Go to your character file, and change your rights to 3, and save, then exit, make sure you’re logged off.<br>
5. There is a command built in called ::givemod<em>playername</em>, ::giveadmin<em>playername</em>, and ::giveowner<em>playername</em>. Or, go into the character folder again, find the person you want, to make them Moderator, change rights to 1, to make admin, change rights to 2, to make Owner, change rights to 3, then save, and make sure they’re logged off.<br>
6. Search for the case numbers I.E the door is case 823, then change the exp rate, or go into your character file, find your name, go to the bottom nearly, and change your exp in the skills you want.<br>
7. Search for SvenScape3pk, and replace with whatever you want.<br>
8. Go to NPCHandler.java, and search for what dialogue you want to change, then just change it and save.</p>
<p>I hope I answered your questions to the fullest.[/quote]</p>
<p>yea he pretty much summed it up!</p>
<p>well besicly all youlle need to learn with changing stuff is look through your client. and if its not there look through the other stuff. then if its not there its built into the cache and theres nothing you can do about it unless its somthing in the client your looking to change.</p>
