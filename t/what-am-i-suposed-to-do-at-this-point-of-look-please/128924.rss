              <p>You need to let it through your firewall. None of the portforwarding tutorials tell you how.<br>
So do this!<br>
Clcik the start button. On the right side you should see control panel. Click that.<br>
Now once it’s open go over to the left and click classic mode/ view. I don’t remember what it says.<br>
Now go down to windows firewall and double-click it or right click it then open.<br>
Clcik the change settings button and then click the exceptions tab at the top in the middle. Go down near the bottom and click on add port.<br>
The port name needs to be Private Server or the same name of the name in the portforward box in your router. Set the port to 43594 and click TCP. Clcik OK and you’re done!!! Your server should work! If you have any questions feel free to ask!</p>
