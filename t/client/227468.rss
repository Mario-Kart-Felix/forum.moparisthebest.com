but wtf how do you get them to work

there are multiple .gz files for 1 item....... how do you install these so you see the item correctly.

Please help 

Ive had 1 file for 1 item but............ im pretty sure i put it in correctly but the item shows up wrong.......

So i need help getting models to work
