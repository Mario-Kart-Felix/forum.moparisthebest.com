    <description>I get flamed everytime I ask a question about aryan updating. Yes I know mopar has the double click updater. But I want to learn the way of old. The one where you have to know regex. Which brings me to my question. Where do I find it and how do I use it and learn it. And updating the defs and such. I got the UPDATER the oliver uses. I&#39;m learning java as fast as I can and am constantly getting better but I need someone that will teach me and not just flame me for my ignorance. I would appreciate it much. If you have paypal I would be happy to donate.</description>

              <p>well, you can still use my updater and update the defs yourself, comment out the first 2 wget lines in the .bat file that download the defs from my server and go about it on your own, you can learn regex from <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/extra/regex/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/extra/regex/index.html</a> and update the regex yourself <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
