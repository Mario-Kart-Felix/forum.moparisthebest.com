    <title>MySQL based PHP scripting engine</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/mysql-based-php-scripting-engine/291638</link>
    <description>Well, I got bored today so I figured I may use this sometime.. i&#39;ll probably release at some point, i dunno.. some other features to implement on it before that, though!

It&#39;s basically scripts that can be placed in mysql and then loaded with mod_rewrite (or the php file, which ultimately what mod_rewrite redirects to). If I wanted to, I could even suffix the script names with .php to make them look like real scripts, no? ahaha....

This seems like it would be quite useful for some things, maybe even libraries or whatever, since changes could in some ways be faster to implement, than having to ftp to the server, and then upload, etc etc. but hell, that could just be me.


Scripts are loaded via a class, which when you access a page it calls that class and loads the script, and will again, loop back on that class for any includes/requirements. So, it&#39;s quite trustable since if any bugs occur you just change the one class (or two, if you modify parsing templates).

Test drive:
http://hidendra.ath.cx/scripting/test

http://hidendra.ath.cx/scripting/helloworld will also work seeing as it&#39;s in the database.. some minor feature will probably be added sometime to restrict front end access to for example libraries.

CSS is added in the header where the #css# tag is found and &lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt; tags are added automagically.. so obviously CSS is not a requirement. I do not find a place to place it manually incase the user wants it somewhere special, PLUS Headers and Footers have the ability to be parsed as php ($mainSettings[&#39;EVAL_HEADER&#39;] and EVAL_FOOTER).. 
It will be in the database for each script if parsing the header and footer as php will be allowed (for security reasons) at some point.


Scripts can also be &quot;required&quot; (equivalent to PHP&#39;s require) by appending #require# before the include, ie:

script,someother,#require#hai,sup

if it cannot find the script [b]hai[/b] in the database, it will quit. If it cannot find any of the other ones, it will continue as if nothing ever happened :rolleyes: (unless it hits an error because of it, but even then it should be required if that&#39;s possible).


I find it quite neat myself, but that could just be me &gt;_&gt;</description>
