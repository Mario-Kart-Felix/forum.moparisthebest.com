    <description>Yes, well i have a server called zylafscape.no-ip.biz. and for those who play it, well its not on mopar. because when ever I try to advertise it onto here, it never works. it says your server is offline. to advertise your server it has to be online before you can upload it or summin like that. So im just wordering if someone could help me? Thanks :rolleyes: :rolleyes:</description>
