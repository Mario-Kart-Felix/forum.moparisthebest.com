    <description>Ok at barrows when you are fighting ahrim he fights back with melee, is there a way to make him attack with a spell?

Also I am having a few problems with a lot of spells (they just hit 0 and dont cast) I am using fr33sc4ap3 and was wondering if there was a simple way to fix this.

P.S. my server is called runes of war if you want to test the spells, (It is on hamanchi page)[br][size=1]Posted on: June 25, 2007, 08:48:04 AM[/size][hr]Any help?</description>
