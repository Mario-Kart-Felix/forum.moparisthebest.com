              <p>thomas, I really don’t think he gets what you are trying to say…</p>
<p>strucker, when working with incoming packets (dropping an item, wearing an item, using an item on an item, item on an object, walking, etc) YOU NEVER TRUST THE DATA BEING SENT</p>
<p><code>int objectId = in.readByte(...);
int itemUsedOnObject = in.readShort(...);
int slot = in.readInt(...);</code></p>
<p>you see the data above? DO NOT TRUST ANY OF IT</p>
<p>and do you know why? because people can use things like cheat engine and wpe to inject false packets. so say you didn’t have any sort of check and we had this code.</p>
<p>[code=java]// … code I showed above here</p>
<p>if(itemUsedOnObject == 4151 &amp;&amp; objectId == 1) {<br>
// double the players money or some cool shit<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>now if someone injects a fake packet… they can double their money. why? because there was no check to see if the player even had the item!!</p>
<p>adding this check is referred to as packet validation (I think), and it’s as simple as just checking if the player has the item before doing the action…</p>

<p>literally. nothing happens except you delete the log, and then schedule a task to walk one tile.<br>
you don’t even check to see if the player has the item, and it only works if the player uses the log on the tinderbox.</p>
<p>this is nowhere near finished, nowhere near decent, and nowhere near quality.<br>
[/quote]Go ahead and change it for me, i have no problem, and Why do you say that?<br>
Just because you’re an experienced programmer doesn’t mean you have to go and criticize bad about others; yet this is still better than alot.<br>
And well I’m supposed to finished it later and update the op;<br>
However if you wanna stay in that “Pro” attitude go ahead i dont mind, just i ask you to state what could be better instead of just bombing my thread.<br>
Thanks<br>
[/quote]what are you on about? i never once said i’m better than you, nor did i state this sucked. (even though it does)</p>
<p>you post a topic, titled ‘<span class="bbcode-b">quality</span> firemaking <span class="bbcode-b">base</span>’.<br>
however, this is neither of those.</p>
<p>this is nowhere near finished. it doesn’t: check for logs, check for tinderbox, alternate usage, start the fire, play the animation, play the sound, or add the experience.</p>
<p>you literally schedule and dispatch a task to walk one tile.</p>
<p>if you want this to be a ‘base’ then finish it.<br>
if you want this to be ‘quality’ learn to take criticism.<br>
[/quote]It’s a base for whoever that wants to not start from scratch, and im taking criticsm, thats why i asked you for an answer. thanks</p>
<p>But why would i check if the player has the log i mean, if he used the log its because he has it, doesn’t he?[/quote]no, not always. hence the term ‘spoofing’</p>

              <p>[quote=“Int Bauk, post:7, topic:535026”]you don’t need to document every single bit of code, just document where needed.[/quote]I think the level of documentation is perfect? Constructors and methods should always be documented, otherwise people have to read the code to work out what it does rather than just having a specification. I also found the non-method/constructor comments to be very useful as they explained things that were not immediately obvious by looking at the code.</p>
<p>For example, when I read this…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">                                Server.getTaskScheduler().schedule(new Task(2, true) {
                                        protected void execute() {</code></pre>
<p>I thought it was just dispatching a thread. But no, I read the comment and it’s scheduling a task that will be executed over 2 ticks.</p>
