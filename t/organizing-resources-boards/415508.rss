    <description>http://gamedev.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,512560.msg3758570.html#msg3758570

After that topic, I&#39;m interested in thoughts regarding reorganizing the Resources boards. Perhaps we should simply rename &quot;Effects and Sprites&quot; to 2D Artwork and Sprites, where it can encapsulate an entire forum of 2D artwork, ranging from help to requests, from 2D animated sprites to concept art.

Then I&#39;m questioning whether we need Banners and Backgrounds if we have a more broad 2D artwork section. I still vote for it, because it&#39;s nice having a separation of artwork shared between 2D and 3D games in a section not particular to 2D or 3D.

And this also made me think, does the 3D Resources board cover animations? We never explicitly mention them.</description>
