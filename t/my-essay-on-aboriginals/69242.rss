    <title>My essay on Aboriginals</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-essay-on-aboriginals/69242</link>
    <description>Well, it&#39;s due tomorrow, but say what you think anyway. I don&#39;t guarantee any level of accuracy.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Part A
The Aboriginal people have a very strong connection to the Dreaming, or ‘Dreamtime’. It outlines virtually everything important to the Aboriginal people – the way they should live, the way they should act around other members of their family and tribe, but most importantly about the land itself, and how they are a part of it.
The Dreaming also outlines how the Aboriginal people came to be, and their duties as people who use the land. The aboriginal people do not see any land as land that is owned – instead, they share a mutual respect, only taking what they need for the land, and in return they cherish it.

There are many stories that make up the dreaming. Many of these stories are children’s stories, used to teach Aboriginal children the ways of society. This includes: how to act around others, how to behave in general, how to hunt, and how to survive. 

However, they are also used to explain where they came from, and why things are the way they are.
One story aimed at teaching people the proper way to behave is the story titled ‘The Watji Bird’. This story is about a bird who suggests a flying competition. The bird that flies the highest will be the greatest bird of all. However, in the story the Watji bird cheats. He is then picked on by all of the other birds. The main message of this story is that cheating is wrong, and if you are caught cheating, you will get in trouble for it.

Although many stories are used to teach the basic rules and laws of Aboriginal society, some are used to basically ‘scare’ people out of doing things.
One story like this is called ‘Boolba Dreaming’. The story is about a young couple just married who, along with others, have gone on a ‘honeymoon’ to some caves. There is a storm that night, and the young couple is drowned in the cave they were in. From then on, their ghosts haunt the caves, and scare other people away.
This story basically aims to discourage Aboriginals using caves.

Aboriginal artwork is also linked to the dreaming. There are paintings to describe many things. For example, Aboriginal tribes have paintings which are used to describe who a person can marry. The painting outlines various skin groups for males and females, and lines on the painting link them together. There are four skin groups for both males and females. Males from one skin group must marry a female from a certain skin group, and can not marry people that aren’t in this group. If they have a child, that child becomes a member of a skin group different to both their mother and father.
Some artwork is also used to depict the spirits that created the universe and the land in the dreaming stories.

In conclusion, both dreaming stories and Aboriginal artwork play a significant role in the lives of Aboriginals. The dreaming stories provide reasoning for Aboriginals, and also teach them important life long lessons that help them live their daily lives.
The art’s role is especially significant, as it supports the stories and outlines how some things need to take place.
 
Part B
The most important thing to the Aboriginal people is the land that they live on. They have a very strong connection to the land; they cherish the land that they live on, and do whatever they can within their power to protect it.
The aboriginal people see the land as highly sacred because they believe that when the spirits made the universe, they went back into the land and stayed there. For this reason, they do not see themselves as people who own the land, but people who have a responsibility to look after the land.

The concept of land is the key to the way Aboriginal people live. Due to this, the raising of Aboriginal children is also centered around the land.
Aboriginal education is carried out by someone in the child’s extended family – if they’re a boy, their uncles will educate them. If they’re a girl, their aunties do it. 
It is worth noting that there is a lot of gender separation in Aboriginal culture – it is virtually illegal for girls to learn boy stuff, and for boys to learn about girls stuff. That is why relatives of the same sex are responsible for their education.

Once their education begins, it is based on three things – the physical world, the spiritual world, and the emotional world, which was learned on the day in the land presentation.
The physical world teaches them all about things around them that are also a part of the land. These things include animals, plantation, their language, the environment, and stuff about their country in general (the Aboriginal definition of country is very different to our own definition).
The spiritual part of their education focuses on things such as kinship, and the laws that govern their tribes.
The third section, the emotional world, covers things such as what can happen in life, and how to deal with them.
At the center of these three sections, or ‘worlds’, is the land.
As discussed on the day, all three of these education sections are required for the smooth upbringing of an Aboriginal child.

However, the Aboriginals have other connections with the land that go beyond living off it. Lots of Aboriginal artwork is actually on the sacred sites. One example, as discovered in Tammy’s presentation, is the artwork at Uluru. Uluru is a very sacred place for many Aboriginal people; some sections of the rock were restricted to female Aboriginals for things such as giving birth, and other parts were restricted to male Aboriginals in the tribes there. Celebrations occurred at these places, which involved music, dance, and also art.
Some sacred sites are cherished and seen as highly significant by Aboriginal communities because it is believed that the spirits re-entered the land at those particular locations in the Dreaming.

In conclusion, the land is the center of every single Aboriginal person’s life. Their education is based around it, their survival is based around it, and their stories of creation are based around it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Well, I’ve already handed it in (it’s 4:04pm here at the moment) earlier today. That’s a habit I’ve fallen into, although I’m sure they won’t worry about it that much.<br>

<p>Another thing, work on your ending paragraph for the second part, it is too short and sadly, cuts the essay off completely. Be more descriptive, for example, something along the lines of what I would write is:<br>
“In conclusion, from the points that I have raised in my essay, it is correct to say that the land has not only a physical, but also a spiritual connection with Australian Aboriginals. This is a tight bond, in which their education, survival, stories of creation and beliefs grow upon. The Australian Aboriginals are quite unique in this way; the way that they work independently to protect the land means a great deal of importance to themselves and all members of each seperate Aboriginal community.” blah blah blah, you get the message <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>Well, it’s due tomorrow, but say what you think anyway. I don’t guarantee any level of accuracy.</p>
<blockquote>Part A
The Aboriginal people have a very strong connection to the Dreaming, or ‘Dreamtime’. It outlines virtually everything important to the Aboriginal people – the way they should live, the way they should act around other members of their family and tribe, but most importantly about the land itself, and how they are a part of it.
The Dreaming also outlines how the Aboriginal people came to be, and their duties as people who use the land. The aboriginal people do not see any land as land that is owned – instead, they share a mutual respect, only taking what they need for the land, and in return they cherish it.
<p>There are many stories that make up the dreaming. Many of these stories are children’s stories, used to teach Aboriginal children the ways of society. This includes: how to act around others, how to behave in general, how to hunt, and how to survive.</p>
<p>However, they are also used to explain where they came from, and why things are the way they are.<br>
One story aimed at teaching people the proper way to behave is the story titled ‘The Watji Bird’. This story is about a bird who suggests a flying competition. The bird that flies the highest will be the greatest bird of all. However, in the story the Watji bird cheats. He is then picked on by all of the other birds. The main message of this story is that cheating is wrong, and if you are caught cheating, you will get in trouble for it.</p>
<p>Although many stories are used to teach the basic rules and laws of Aboriginal society, some are used to basically ‘scare’ people out of doing things.<br>
One story like this is called ‘Boolba Dreaming’. The story is about a young couple just married who, along with others, have gone on a ‘honeymoon’ to some caves. There is a storm that night, and the young couple is drowned in the cave they were in. From then on, their ghosts haunt the caves, and scare other people away.<br>
This story basically aims to discourage Aboriginals using caves.</p>
<p>Aboriginal artwork is also linked to the dreaming. There are paintings to describe many things. For example, Aboriginal tribes have paintings which are used to describe who a person can marry. The painting outlines various skin groups for males and females, and lines on the painting link them together. There are four skin groups for both males and females. Males from one skin group must marry a female from a certain skin group, and can not marry people that aren’t in this group. If they have a child, that child becomes a member of a skin group different to both their mother and father.<br>
Some artwork is also used to depict the spirits that created the universe and the land in the dreaming stories.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both dreaming stories and Aboriginal artwork play a significant role in the lives of Aboriginals. The dreaming stories provide reasoning for Aboriginals, and also teach them important life long lessons that help them live their daily lives.<br>
The art’s role is especially significant, as it supports the stories and outlines how some things need to take place.</p>
<p>Part B<br>
The most important thing to the Aboriginal people is the land that they live on. They have a very strong connection to the land; they cherish the land that they live on, and do whatever they can within their power to protect it.<br>
The aboriginal people see the land as highly sacred because they believe that when the spirits made the universe, they went back into the land and stayed there. For this reason, they do not see themselves as people who own the land, but people who have a responsibility to look after the land.</p>
<p>The concept of land is the key to the way Aboriginal people live. Due to this, the raising of Aboriginal children is also centered around the land.<br>
Aboriginal education is carried out by someone in the child’s extended family – if they’re a boy, their uncles will educate them. If they’re a girl, their aunties do it.<br>
It is worth noting that there is a lot of gender separation in Aboriginal culture – it is virtually illegal for girls to learn boy stuff, and for boys to learn about girls stuff. That is why relatives of the same sex are responsible for their education.</p>
<p>Once their education begins, it is based on three things – the physical world, the spiritual world, and the emotional world, which was learned on the day in the land presentation.<br>
The physical world teaches them all about things around them that are also a part of the land. These things include animals, plantation, their language, the environment, and stuff about their country in general (the Aboriginal definition of country is very different to our own definition).<br>
The spiritual part of their education focuses on things such as kinship, and the laws that govern their tribes.<br>
The third section, the emotional world, covers things such as what can happen in life, and how to deal with them.<br>
At the center of these three sections, or ‘worlds’, is the land.<br>
As discussed on the day, all three of these education sections are required for the smooth upbringing of an Aboriginal child.</p>
<p>However, the Aboriginals have other connections with the land that go beyond living off it. Lots of Aboriginal artwork is actually on the sacred sites. One example, as discovered in Tammy’s presentation, is the artwork at Uluru. Uluru is a very sacred place for many Aboriginal people; some sections of the rock were restricted to female Aboriginals for things such as giving birth, and other parts were restricted to male Aboriginals in the tribes there. Celebrations occurred at these places, which involved music, dance, and also art.<br>
Some sacred sites are cherished and seen as highly significant by Aboriginal communities because it is believed that the spirits re-entered the land at those particular locations in the Dreaming.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the land is the center of every single Aboriginal person’s life. Their education is based around it, their survival is based around it, and their stories of creation are based around it.</p>
