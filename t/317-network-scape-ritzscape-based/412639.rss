    <description>Hello people of Moparscape.
This is my FIRST EVER post...
I have decided to &quot;try to&quot; make a RSPS.
I am very bad at coding and I can&#39;t code one thing.
All I want to do is to add some stuff and maybe make a new home area and stuff.
I am trying to edit some of the items in game but there&#39;s just one problem...
There&#39;s LOADS of lagg and I have no idea of how to fix this.
I am not sure if this is in the right category as I have never posted before.
Also i&#39;m not sure if you can request help but can someone just help me through making this?
I really want to make a Private Server I just don&#39;t have the knowledge so I want to learn along side a pro...
I am really trying hard by looking at TuT&#39;s but all of them are like Project Insanity...
I have downloaded Project Insanity Source + Client and I wanted to know if I should use this as a base???
I am truely sorry if this is in the wrong category!</description>

Is it possible if someone gives me a link to a Client + Source?<br>
I just want decent Sources that are easy to work from, from some experienced coders!<br>
And thanks for all your suggestions and stuff <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">

<h2>I searched on Google for AllStar scape Source + Client and I downloaded it…<br>
Just gonna see what I can do and stuff <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">
</h2>
<p>I’m not sure if you can double-post so I will modify my previous posts…<br>
Anyway, is AllStar-Scape an old version so it like looks really old and cheap? Or can I run it so it looks nice like a 508 like RitzScape I think…<br>
I just need to learn a few more things before I start taking big steps <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

Well, this is in fact the right section. And good luck on your first project! Altough I suggest PI for beginners instead of Ritzscape.<br>
[/quote]PI for beginners? thats a little intense for first time coders. My opinion is start out with allstar see what you can do. Move to delta wich is like allstar but a bit different. Then move Pi then 508+ oh and add media :D[/quote]</p>
<p>Agreed, start with something easy, you will eventually get the hang of it</p>

              <p>Well I guess you can call it a base. Seeing as you are working off of someone else’s creation. Bases should be something entirely different than what it was originally based off of. Ritzscape is not very different from the original Delta.</p>
