    <description>Hey guys, so im fresh to the PC Minecraft community and I don&#39;t have the game on PC. I&#39;ve seen topics offering cracks, but they&#39;re all outdated or the files have been removed from the website. I was wondering if anybody had a Safe version for download...? or nowadays would it be better to just buy the game..?</description>
