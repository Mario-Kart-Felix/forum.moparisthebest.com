    <title>PI server side clipping in combat walk here</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-server-side-clipping-in-combat-walk-here/441101</link>
    <description>i did this tut and its clipping but i got few problems.
first if Player A is standing right next to a wall/object and if Player B attacks the Player A, and if Player A also attacks player B, then if Player B walks under Player A, then the Player A no clips and passes through that object/wall :\ 
another thing is that you can do melee/attack in diagonal way :S found a tut for this but cant use it... anyways another thing is that if thr is an object between Player A and Player B, and if both are using melee, then still they can attack through that object... for example 
 &quot; | &quot; that &#39; | &#39; line is an object, and player A and Player B are two melee people.. here
A|B as you can see that thr is an object between those 2 players, now they can still attack each other over that object, (no they dont walk on that object, thr melee just can attack the other side player) this also hapens from 2 tiles away also or more... any fix for this???
 this is my attackplayer.java  https://dl.dropbox.com/s/0ppjdqj8eiwwwrr/AttackPlayer.java?dl=1</description>
