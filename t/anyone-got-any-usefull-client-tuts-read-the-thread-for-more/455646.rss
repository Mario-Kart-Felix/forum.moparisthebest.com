    <description>Hey, I&#39;m working on a Spawn Server project with my friend and I was wondering if by any chance anyone has any client tutorials such as making new sprites, adding them in and adding custom buttons in..

Changing sprites is pretty easy, I want to be creative and add a few things of my own so if anyone could help me out please respond.

ask for my Skype if you wish to join the project or atleast teach me a few things personally :) 

Thanks.</description>
