    <description>i got perm banned for macroing, but i got it undone... here is how it works

first send in a real appeal saying that you dont macro, then the next day when they say your still perm banned, send in a fake appeal laughing at them and saying HA HA HA I GOT THIS GUY BANNED!!!! HE WAS LEGIT&lt; AND HES BANNED MUHAHAHAHA IM GOING TO DO THIS MUCH MORE OFTEN, and shit like that

they lock your acount becasue *someone* else knows your pass, recover your account, and vola your unbanned :D

hope this helps people</description>

Dear IAMABETTERPE,

Thank you for your ban appeal.

We regret to inform you that this account has been banned because of Macroing.

Please refer to article number 7 in the Rules of Conduct:

Rule 7: You must not attempt to use other programs (e.g. bots, macros or autominers) in conjunction with our games to give yourself an unfair advantage at the game. You also may not circumvent any of our mechanisms designed to log out inactive users automatically.

We do not discuss our detection process with anyone, to do such would give auto/macro users information to help them avoid detection. For all the details on our macro detection that we are willing to give out please read the Macro FAQ, which can be found by selecting the link titled 'Get the answer to a question' under the 'Information and Advice' section (left) on the main page of our website (www.runescape.com).

We are 100% confident in our macro detection systems, and in the highly trained staff who monitor and take action based on the results presented by these systems, and as such are 100% confident that you have been using such a program. This is a clear violation of the Rules of Conduct as and such your account has been placed on a permanent ban.

This decision is *final* and any further ban appeals will not be considered.

Sincerely,
RuneScape Customer Support

Dear IAMABETTERPE,

This is not the correct form for password support.

You must use the correct form so we can verify your identity before issuing you with a new password.

Please can you fill out an Account Recovery form through the appropriate procedure (as detailed below) so we can be sure we are returning this account to its rightful owner.

1. Go to http://www.runescape.com/

2. Under the 'Account Recovery' section (left) on the main page of our website, click on the link titled 'Recover a locked account'.

3. On the resulting pages read the instructions and fill out all fields in the forms.

4. Click the 'Submit Request' button and you will be issued with a Tracking ID. Please remember to write this down as you will need this to establish if your request has been successful or not. 

Sincerely,
Mod Far
RuneScape Customer Support

              <p>i got perm banned for macroing, but i got it undone… here is how it works</p>
<p>first send in a real appeal saying that you dont macro, then the next day when they say your still perm banned, send in a fake appeal laughing at them and saying HA HA HA I GOT THIS GUY BANNED!!! HE WAS LEGIT&lt; AND HES BANNED MUHAHAHAHA IM GOING TO DO THIS MUCH MORE OFTEN, and shit like that</p>
<p>they lock your acount becasue <em>someone</em> else knows your pass, recover your account, and vola your unbanned <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>hope this helps people</p>
