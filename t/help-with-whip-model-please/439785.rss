    <title>Help With Whip Model Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-whip-model-please/439785</link>
    <description>Ok, so im a NOOB at modeling. taught myself some minor things yesterday. i have recently been tryign to make a Lime Whip model because i cant figure out how to use my .editedModelColor = and .newModelColor = variables in ItemDef. i have created the model perfectly, and it looks great, the problem is, there is no animation. when you are wielding the whip, it doesnt sway like the normal whips. it is just a currled up ball. I am pretty sure i neeed to like add some animation, but im not sure. if someone could help me with this, then i could pay you $3 via paypal. If you would like to just remake me a lime whip over teamviewer, ill pay you $5. also, i have already added the whip in CombatAssistant.java to see if that would make it animate, but ti didn&#39;t. this is what i want the whip to look like when the player is standing.
