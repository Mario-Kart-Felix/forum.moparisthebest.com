(title) Karizma 317

(Intro)
Welcome to karizma 317
This RSPS is coded from the first released PI. The reason why- I dont want to take someone elses source and code a bit and release it i want a challenge and to be able to say yeah.. i coded that or yeah i ripped that(lol).  Anyways i want to code this and be proud of it, I want people to think and say good job i also want people to have fun while playing on it and encourage to make more and better this server is going to have everything i can possibley do everything that i have learned will be put into this.  This is Karizma and it is awsome.

(What we are about)
We arn&#39;t about the money nor anything like that me and my brother are only in this project to have fun and make a good server for everyone and while it is up people can have fun and have a little taste of Karizma.  We only will be putting it online for a month to have fun with people and hopefully get all the bugs and glitches out of the server.

(Our goals)
Our goals are to have a fair ammount of people on while it is on for that month and to make everyone happy.
our other goals are to complete the server and have a good pking system while we will have dungeoneering and summoning. 

(Pking/Economy)
The pking is going to be great not the best as it would almost be impossible for me to get it like that but it is going to be really good perfect switches sara brews ect. all working while we will have a good stable economy and have no dupes or money glitches what so ever.


(Skills)
All combats are 100%
working prayer with the curses (thank my brother for this i dont know how he added lol call me a nub for that)
Fishing 100%
woodcutting 100%
Fire making 100%
Fletching 98%
Rc 99%
Crafting 99%
Thieve 100%
Herb 100% ( not like real rs but it is still 100%  the way it works
Farming 100% wor

(Features)
Our current features are
All chaotics added in properly (i only added in c staff and c bow as the others were already in the PI source)
Dclaws
Korasi (100%) working
100% magics exept for The lunar book only the veng other and veng will work.
