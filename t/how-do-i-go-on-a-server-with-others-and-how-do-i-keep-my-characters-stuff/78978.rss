              <p>Hi…If you want to go onto another server go to this website. <a href="http://www.aahost.nozonenet.com/serverstatus" rel="nofollow noopener">www.aahost.nozonenet.com/serverstatus</a> and go to the THIRD link. Then pick any server and on ur Moparscape Webclient go to ‘file’, ‘new server’…then type something like…71.75.83.182, and now go to file again and then go to ‘new port’ and type in 43594. Now if it says something like It might be down…just go to the website i gave u and find the one you think looks cool and just go have fun!</p>
