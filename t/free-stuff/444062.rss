    <description>I no longer play the game, but my friend does.  I also check the news for updates every now and then too.  The thing is though, every time I see my friend log on, there&#39;s always some kind of advertisement for free crap for members, like &quot;Be a member for a month, and you get this necklace that gives 2x XP&quot; or something like that.  In fact, over the past month I&#39;ve noticed they give out loads of free Squeal spins (whatever they&#39;re called) and free xp, and free random junk.

I&#39;ve also actually stopped getting on their website because it seems like it take years to load due to the 565365536 million images on it.

Why is there so much &#39;product pushing&#39; when just trying to play the damn game?  They&#39;re just like allot of the generic MMOs now in the fact that they almost don&#39;t hide the fact that they&#39;re out for money.  I know that was their original intentions, but at least they weren&#39;t to desperate and obvious back then.</description>

<p>If your business is losing lots of money do you let it die or do you do your best to get money out of your customers to keep the company alive. I know what I would do and Jagex do the same. I agree it is annoying for us players but if it keeps the game alive I say let them do it.</p>
<p>I really don’t think Jagex are out of money though.[/quote]<br>
I never said they were.  I’m just saying, they were pulling loads in revenue beforehand.  I mean, I don’t mind benefits with becoming a member, just, I get sick of being told to do it every time I walk around.  Surely the average child could remember to bug their parents enough to buy it after being reminds a few times.</p>
<p>That and I’m also tired of all the fancy gfx shit on the homepage, takes a year to load and it’s so unnecessary.</p>

<p>I got the 10M cash on my pure without buying spins.<br>
Wasn’t really excited though because I’d lost 20M that day so…</p>
