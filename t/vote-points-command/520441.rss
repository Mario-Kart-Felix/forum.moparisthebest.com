    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vote-points-command/520441</link>
    <description>hello everyone i was needing help making a command that a owner could use to get vote points. Im using a 728 (zenithscape) so i am not able to give my player points through (playername.java). If you could come up with a command that would be awesome and much appreciated! Thanks!</description>
