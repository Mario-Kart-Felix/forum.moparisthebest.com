    <title>Shop Currency/Using different Currency. Pk Points</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/shop-currency-using-different-currency-pk-points/178283</link>
    <description>Well, i need a shop so you can buy stuff from there, But only with your PK points.

Iv&#39;e made a mini-game, it gives you pk points when you kill someone. But you dont loose your stuff. Takes you back to waiting room. And the winner gets 10 points + how many they kill, The rest get how many they kill.

Anyways i want it so that you can buy and sell stuff for PK points. Can anybody help?</description>
