    <description>[Req] Windmills of your Mind - Great song

Song on Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windmills_of_Your_Mind

This song was originally made for the movie The Thomas Crown Affair starring Steve McQueen, but I can&#39;t find the song on Google nor on www.dizzler.com. I&#39;m looking for the original one. Not the ones by the Allison Moyet or the Sting. The original was by &quot;Alan Bergman, Marilyn Bergman and Michel Legrand and performed by Noel Harrison.&quot;

Cookies for you if you can get it. :D Thank you!

PS: Don&#39;t upload it since Mopar doesn&#39;t want anything illegal on the forums, so if you can find it, just link to it. :)</description>
