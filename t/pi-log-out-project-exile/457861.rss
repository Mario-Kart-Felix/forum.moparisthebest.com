    <title>[PI] Log-out Project-Exile?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-log-out-project-exile/457861</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, I&#39;ve been editing my server for a while now, and now just finishing off the last few bits before going online..
However, I noticed one thing, when I click the logout button, it says 
&quot;When you have finished playing Project-Exile, always use the button below to log out safely&quot;
I have searched for ages looking where this is and am still un-able to find it, and I think it&#39;s hidden.
Is there a way to change it? Thanks in advance.</description>

              <p>I don’t know the whole deal on why its not found, i think its a picture and not text. But anyways to change the name, search for the word “Runescape” on your client and next to it should say Project-Exile, change that to your servers name. I hope that helps you</p>
