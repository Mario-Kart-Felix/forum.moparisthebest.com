    <title>Java is not recognized as an internal or external or batch file</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-or-batch-file/377924</link>
    <description>I need some help with this. Everytime i run my server I get a problem stating that java is not recognized as an internal or external command or batch file. The problem started happening after i updated my jdk to update 23. Ive read all kinds of tuts telling me that I needed to set my path but when i try it still doesnt work. I also restored my computer to an earlier point in time when it was working(didnt work). At the moment i Have jdk 21, If anyone could help me I&#39;d appreciate it thanks.

PS- IDk if i was setting my path right.</description>
