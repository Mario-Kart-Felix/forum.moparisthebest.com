    <title>Songs About Mutants</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/songs-about-mutants/340476</link>
    <description>So, in class we read this horrid book titled, The Chrysalids.

Our assignment now is to write a &quot;sound track&quot; for the book.  We need to pick 10 songs and explain how line(s) from this song relate to the book.

So, I need some songs related to mutants or mutations.

I need 10 in total, so as much help as i can get would be amazing.

Thanks guys!</description>

              <p>Death - Living Monstrosity</p>
<blockquote>Every day blows by in a world of corrupt addiction
With life comes pain withdrawals and deformation
Breaking the mould human appearance
Contorting bodies with chamical interference
<p>The guilty one, innocent she now cries<br>
A life of hell, better off to die<br>
Born without eyes, hands, and a half a brain<br>
Being born addicted to cocaine</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Living monstrosity<br>
A freak for life they’ll always be<br>
Never knowing love or hate<br>
Only pain the drug creates</span></p>
<p>Some say she’s naive, she’s a stupid bitch<br>
Some say to forgive, guilty she should die</p>
<p>The beginning of the end begins at birth<br>
Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh<br>
An example we should make out of theses creators of misfortune<br>
A serious crime that should not be forgiven</p>
<p>The guilty one, innocent she now cries<br>
A life of hell, better off to die<br>
Born without eyes, hands, and a half a brain<br>
Being born addicted to cocaine</p>

<p>Especially the highlighted lines could be useful i 'spose. The song’s about a mother giving birth to a baby while she’s addicated to cocaine. The baby’s the living monstrosity.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could throw in Death’s Leprosy as well, not too sure about that one though.</p>

<p>I just made up like 6 of them, the teacher isn’t going to be listening to the songs…we just need to provide a few lines from the lyrics.</p>
<p>So, solved I suppose?</p>
