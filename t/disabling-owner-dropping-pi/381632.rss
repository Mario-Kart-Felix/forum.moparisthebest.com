    <title>Disabling owner dropping? [pi]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disabling-owner-dropping-pi/381632</link>
    <description>Hi, I need help how to disabled owner dropping so when they die they keep all their stuff, and also my rank 4, which is hidden super admin.

Not sure how to go about doing this so all help very much appreciated.

Edit:

ok i currently have this which i think will work if i can fix the naming. 10 compile errors at the moment, worked down from 15 or so. i believe its just the labels are messed up, but im not sure how to find out the correct ones, as for the ones i did fix such as spec i found the name from commands in my clist. reset damage down to updatehp are ones giving errors atm :S

[code]public void applyDead() {	
		c.respawnTimer = 10;
		c.isDead = true;
		if (c.playerRights &gt;= 3) {
                resetDamage();
                deadTele();
                IsDead = false;
                killMyNPCs();
                resetDuel();
                resetEmotes();
                resetKeepItem();
                resetOtherAtk();
                setSkillLevel(i);
                updateHp(getLevelForXP(playerXP[3]), true);
               
                c.updateRequired = true;
                c.specAmount = 100;
                c.sendMessage(&quot;Since you&#39;re an administrator, you do not lose items&quot;);
                return;[/code]</description>
