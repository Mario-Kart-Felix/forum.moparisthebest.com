    <description>Well, You know how when you right click a player it says like follow, attack, etc. I was wondering if i could add like something that says &quot;duel&quot; and you click it... it sends the other player a request to duel and if they accept you can duel them any where in the whole server. Would that be possible to make? o.0. If so how?</description>
