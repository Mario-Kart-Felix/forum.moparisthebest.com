    <description>Can someone explain to me why in RSCD everything is like:

[code]private long clientUID;

public long getClientUID() {
	return clientUID;
}[/code]

It&#39;s then called by player.getClientUID()...

But why isn&#39;t the declaration just made public and then call it by player.clientUID?

I haven&#39;t been writing Java for very long but I can&#39;t think or see of any reason why this would be better. It may not sound like much but a serious lot of code could be saved by doing it the way I suggested. I&#39;m in the process of converting to the latter wherever possible but I want to know if there&#39;s any reason why I shouldn&#39;t be doing this.</description>

<p>There’s another big difference, though. (This is the case, only if the API is published and used by a lot of programmers (perhaps even around the world). No client wants their programs broken because of backwards-compatibility issues.) All “protected” members are part of the published API and may not be removed (the same as with “public”). However, “private” and “package-private” may be changed any way shape or form, as long as the contract of the API is followed.</p>

<p>In other news, the ‘protected’ keyword is an alternative to having everything private and providing getters/setters. This assumes that you have a package structure that makes some inkling of sense.</p>

</aside>
<p>That isn’t true at all.  ‘protected’ basically means it is public only to child classes (classes that extend that class) and private to all other classes.</p>

<p>Cool. You seem to be a fanboy of Class C high-level languages. By Class C I mean languages like Scala that in the real world are practically useless or don’t have a wide audience. Properties are just a syntactic sugar to express accessor methods. If you want to talk about simulation and if you look at how properties get compiled, then properties are actually a simulation of accessor methods - just in a more convenient way. If you want to talk about simulation even more then OO design is actually a simulation.</p>
<p>Also, Kryptix, I don’t think you understood what properties really are. I can’t talk about Scala, but in C# you can have auto-implemented properties - now this indeed saves some code.</p>
<p>It looks something like this, the actual field is generated automatically.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int X
{
            get;
            set;
}</code></pre>
<p>However at times you want the setter method to check for a given condition before assigning the new value, you need to create the actual field yourself.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public int Y
{
            get
            {
                return y;
            }

            set
            {
                if (value &lt; 100)
                {
                    y = value;
                }
            }
}

private int y;</code></pre>
<p>This basically means that even with properties you probably end up writing almost the same amount of code as with setters/getters. And to illustrate why you shouldn’t let others access a field of a class directly I created an example from the C++ world - you probably can’t get away with something like this in Java, but there are similar errors.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class TheClass
{
public:
	TheClass(void) : x(0) { };
	int x;
};

int main(void)
{
	TheClass tc;
	
	if (tc.x = 1)
	{
		std::cout &lt;&lt; "Oops, wanted to check if tc.x == 1." &lt;&lt; std::endl;
	}

	std::cin.sync();
	std::cin.get();
	return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case tc.x gets the value 1. C++ is backward compatible with C where every nonzero value is true, so this is allowed. Mistakes of this kind can be avoided by using encapsulation.[/quote]</p>
<p>For one, Scala doesn’t even have properties at the language level (but it’s extremely easy to simulate).  Not only that, but it’s a really new language and has gained a crapload of popularity in a short period of time, and most likely going to be the next Java.  Also, how is it any less useful than Java?</p>
<p>Properties aren’t really syntactical sugar, they should be built into the language to enforce the idea of encapsulation.  They’re just as much a part of encapsulation as access modifiers; as they go hand-in-hand.  As for what comes out of the compiler, that’s completely irreverent as there are tons of things that are clearly useful and assist in OOD yet get lost when compiled.</p>
<p>Also, lines of code completely depends on the class…  For example, the Player class would be much smaller with them.</p>
<p>A typo isn’t really a valid reason to encapsulate things…  In addition, you should always put the r-value on the left to avoid issues like that, seeing the compiler recognizes you can’t set 1 to tc.x.</p>

If you had getters I could still get the value of myField, but I couldn’t change it, and if you had setters, I could try to set the value of your field, but you could do checks to make sure I never set it to null, or if you decided to change the type of myField internally, then you could leave the setters and getters the same and my class would never have to know you changed, and would still work as expected.</p>
<p>Making variables declared final public is alright though, since the compiler assures that those values can never be changed for you.  Otherwise, you should make them private or protected.</p>

What does matter is that any other class can just go around changing your values on you, and if you need to change the structure of your class later, it will break all of those other classes, where as if you stick to encapsulation like this, you can change anything you like internally and keep the same API from the outside.</p>
<p>It’s basically the first thing you learn in your first class about Object Orientation, right after ‘Hello World!’.</p>

              <p>What Lothy said, so never change stuff like that, it isn’t good coding practice and it can cause nightmares when code needs changed or if that variable is suddenly changed on you.</p>
<p>As far as variables go, a good rule of thumb is for every variable to be private or protected unless it is public static and final.</p>

              <p>That practice is known as encapsulation, or data hiding.</p>
<p>With that approach, note that nothing outside of that class can modify the value. On the other hand, anything would be able to change the value of a public variable.</p>
<p>Even if you are going to have an equivalent ‘set’ method though for a variable, it’s still good practice to encapsulate with the set/get methods for access, rather than just public variables.</p>

              <p>Can someone explain to me why in RSCD everything is like:</p>
<p>[code]private long clientUID;</p>
<p>public long getClientUID() {<br>
return clientUID;<br>
}[/code]</p>
<p>It’s then called by player.getClientUID()…</p>
<p>But why isn’t the declaration just made public and then call it by player.clientUID?</p>
<p>I haven’t been writing Java for very long but I can’t think or see of any reason why this would be better. It may not sound like much but a serious lot of code could be saved by doing it the way I suggested. I’m in the process of converting to the latter wherever possible but I want to know if there’s any reason why I shouldn’t be doing this.</p>
