              <p>take the image thats in there, open it in paint or whatever program you use, and edit away. if you wanna make a good one with like banner making programs, then it has to be a certain size which i dont know off the top of my head. then cut it in half and reverse 1 side. theres a tutorial out there cuz i just read 1 a little bit ago.</p>
