    <title>Anyone interested in getting a RSC server going?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-interested-in-getting-a-rsc-server-going/433804</link>
    <description>Im not going to sit here and pretend like I know ANYTHING about coding or  programming, Im also not going to sit here and say I can help out building the server.  I am going to say I can fund the server, and hosting, while donations are still rolling about.  I am not looking for a teenager who wants to abuse my generosity.  If you wish to help get a new server in the RSC community BESIDES rsce, then message me here, leave your email or msn or send me a PM.

I am very eager to see a server that doesnt die in 2 days, that doesnt have a inactive staff base, that has resonable achievments and a *hopefully* commited player base to release them to.

I am not looking for a teacher or help to start a server, I have no desire to learn anything about coding. A little info about myself: I am 23 years old in the military and married with a kid on the way, I graduated from the University of North Carolina with a BS in Science. I started playing RSC in my early teens and havent stopped since.  RSC has some sort of draw on me, it has by far the shittiest graphics of any game Ive played, yet I cannot get away from it.  RSC is just fucking fun, low level pking, high level pking, training, staking, EVERYTHING. I have enjoyed multiple servers up to this point only to be dissapointed by shutdowns from ddosing or inactive or abusive staff with unreasonable compensations for friends and donators.  Now I&#39;m looking to change that.

If you are an experienced *coder?*, mature, and willing to commit to a project, contact me.  If you are an experienced coder and contact me, be prepared to provide proof of your expertise wether its refferals or whatever.  

Once again Im looking for a person/person who are active and willing to stay commited to a project for the long haul.  Thanks for your time and I hope to talk to some of you soon.</description>

              <p>I would be interested in funding to run a server also, that would obviously be populated enough to pay for itself after the first couple of months. I would be willing to listen to all ideas on what server/s be made. In particular I like CodeForFame’s ideas in the server that Ch3rry was proposing. I would only do this if I know that the developers were trustworthy, we could agree on what kind of server with stuff to be implemented.</p>
<p>My brother who has completed a few game design degrees would be willing to help code and run the server.</p>
<p>PM me if you would like to team up or if you are a developer that is interested also.</p>

              <p>EvolutionRsc will be the next one released most likely, talking in a week or so, Purchasing a server on the 29th of february, currently replicating as much as we can the rsc npcs locs defs, item locs defs, shops most of it done. Alot of it will be drops and rates. Been fixing stability issues all day today, removing the gui out of easy rsc itself adding a connectionthrottler for the health of server along with garbagecollecter created by xEnt i think it was to ease the memory. Done nothing MAJOR yet but we’re a work in progress. Anyways it will be in the RSC Advertisement page in a week or so.</p>
