I believe the saying is ‘treat others how you wish to be treated’, your wording suggests that you will be treated how you wish to be treated.<br>

Like I said, I’m here to help.</p>
<p>You people are so quick to judge.[/quote]<br>
Here to help my ass, if you were here to help you’d be doing something useful and productive rather than trying to get people to use your referral link. If you were doing this for no personal gain then you wouldn’t have put the ref link in there in the first place. If you truly are here to help, go to some of the help boards and help the people who need it. We aren’t so quick to judge, we just don’t take kindly to people who try to take advantage.</p>

<p>I was making fun of you, little one… <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> lmfao wow<br>
[/quote]<br>
Right, you didn’t do it very well. You might want to work on that, and your method of taking advantage of younger children.[/quote]</p>
<p>You said this:</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s make a topic about helping people and then degrade them! Logic.”</p>
<p>I was being logical. If you scroll up you will clearly see I was nice at first. I said it in an improper way on purpose to reflect your stupidity, So I believe I’m doing a pretty good job. You’re just too stupid to know when someones making fun of you. Was that too complicated for your minute brain to grasp? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Ruby, you’re retarded… The “spending money on games comment” that I made wasn’t even directed at you; I addressed you after I made that comment to someone else… Do you know how to read?</p>
<p>And using a referral link isn’t taking advantage, Do you lose any money? Anyways, that’s besides the point, I just said I didn’t care if the referral link was used.</p>
<p>Also, you didn’t get mad until you misinterpreted the comment I made about spending money on games as being directed towards you. Don’t you know when you get defensive, it shows your true colors? Now everybody knows you’re a nerd that spends paycheck money on video games lmao 50 points!</p>

        <p>Interesting, degrading other people by making snide remarks about their intelligence. Taking advantage of those with lesser knowledge of scams and false advertisement within the community isn’t taken well, and neither is your sense of superiority. You lack the ability to play well with others, and that isn’t a good trait, friend. You are going to receive nothing more then negative comments for your ‘help’ because no body respects people like yourself. Like ruby said, if you wanted to help you would do more then sit in one thread and assert yourself by degrading members in the community.</p>

<p>He was referring to the “(5-$75 per survey)” on my post. He was being a sarcastic smart ass(or you can get a job instead of scamming people is basically what he said. It’s a shame I had to spell that out for you.) If you can’t see that then you clearly have some form of social deficit…</p>
<p>You all jumped to conclusions and made false judgments from the start, when I was honestly trying to share a money method. If no one acted that way, I would not have reacted the way I did.</p>
<p>You’re just mad because you know that I am right, and you are wrong.</p>
