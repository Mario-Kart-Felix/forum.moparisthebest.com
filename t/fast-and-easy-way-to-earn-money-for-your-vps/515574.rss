<p>You contradict yourself alot lol…</p>
<p>I never said he made fun of me, can anyone here read? I said he was being sarcastic and jumping to conclusions. And it’s obvious that he was by his tone.</p>
<p>hmm I would have still spoke in my ‘superior tone’? So you’re all knowing now? You’re so pathetic haha. It’s funny how serious you get you hot headed narcissist lol this is all just a game for me yet you get so defensive over the internet. Normally I wouldn’t go back and forth for so long but you’re just so damn amusing XD<br>

<p>"Okay.</p>
<p>First off, there is a difference between ignorance, trolling and being an asshole.</p>
<p>Nobody here has done a single thing to upset you, mentally/physically harm you or anything else to that matter. I don’t see why you are acting like a child. Though since you are new you are giving yourself a good name so far. I’m sure some people appreciate you giving them a link to earn a little cash. Not everyone has heard of surveys and making money from it.<br>
I suggest you stop posting ignorant shit and learn to respect others here because that is the only way they will respect you."</p>
<p>Am I suppose to laugh? lol</p>

<p>This what’s his face? That wasn’t a smart arse remark, and you saying that he was trolling was incorrect. He stated a more successful way of earning money rather then your poor excuse for one. You were arrogant, still are, and most likely always will be. I don’t think anyone will disagree with me on that point, other then yourself, because you’re too headstrong to admit it to yourself.[/quote]</p>
<p>He was referring to the “(5-$75 per survey)” on my post. He was being a sarcastic smart ass(or you can get a job instead of scamming people is basically what he said. It’s a shame I had to spell that out for you.) If you can’t see that then you clearly have some form of social deficit…</p>
<p>You all jumped to conclusions and made false judgments from the start, when I was honestly trying to share a money method. If no one acted that way, I would not have reacted the way I did.</p>
<p>You’re just mad because you know that I am right, and you are wrong.</p>

<p>This what’s his face? That wasn’t a smart arse remark, and you saying that he was trolling was incorrect. He stated a more successful way of earning money rather then your poor excuse for one. You were arrogant, still are, and most likely always will be. I don’t think anyone will disagree with me on that point, other then yourself, because you’re too headstrong to admit it to yourself.</p>

<p>You said this:</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s make a topic about helping people and then degrade them! Logic.”</p>
<p>I was being logical. If you scroll up you will clearly see I was nice at first. I said it in an improper way on purpose to reflect your stupidity, So I believe I’m doing a pretty good job. You’re just too stupid to know when someones making fun of you. Was that too complicated for your minute brain to grasp? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Ruby, you’re retarded… The “spending money on games comment” that I made wasn’t even directed at you; I addressed you after I made that comment to someone else… Do you know how to read?</p>
<p>And using a referral link isn’t taking advantage, Do you lose any money? Anyways, that’s besides the point, I just said I didn’t care if the referral link was used.</p>
<p>Also, you didn’t get mad until you misinterpreted the comment I made about spending money on games as being directed towards you. Don’t you know when you get defensive, it shows your true colors? Now everybody knows you’re a nerd that spends paycheck money on video games lmao 50 points!</p>

Here to help my ass, if you were here to help you’d be doing something useful and productive rather than trying to get people to use your referral link. If you were doing this for no personal gain then you wouldn’t have put the ref link in there in the first place. If you truly are here to help, go to some of the help boards and help the people who need it. We aren’t so quick to judge, we just don’t take kindly to people who try to take advantage.</p>

<p>Or you can get a job.  I heard that can up to $2000 each week!</p>

<p>That amount of cash is a surgeons income if not lawyer, cant imagine any teenagers here receiving that amount in the bank per week.</p>
<p>OT: One glance at the website and I can already tell it is full of shit</p>

<p>I said <span class="bbcode-b">up to</span> $2000.  I realize alot of people here will never earn that much in their lives.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well, I said <span class="bbcode-b">extra money</span>, so there was no reason for your input anyways… Only a loser would spend their hard earned dollars on a game… I take it you do?</p>
<p>“This isn’t a place for you to make money, nice referral link you’ve got there.”</p>
<p>Both people benefit, smart one.</p>
<p>Besides, the referral link is there; might as well use it.</p>

</aside>
<p>I literally spend close to no money on games and gaming, my money goes towards alcohol and keeping my cars running. Not really a big fan of your stereotypes. This will be locked or removed soon anyway.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>My stereotypes? lol… You’re the one that came in here being an obnoxious fool and you have the nerve to say that? lol nice sense of humor btw XD[/quote]<br>
Yes, your stereotypes. What makes you think I spend money on games? Because I’m an active member of a gaming community? That’s stereotypical my friend. I’m not being an obnoxious fool, I’m stating the idiocy of someone like you. What makes you think a community forum which has a strict no goods exchanged policy would allow referral links for someone to make money of their users?</p>
