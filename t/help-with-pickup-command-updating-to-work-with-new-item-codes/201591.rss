    <title>Help with ::pickup command? [updating to work with new item codes]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-pickup-command-updating-to-work-with-new-item-codes/201591</link>
    <description>Well, i downloaded this new source, and i made some changes to it. Then i found out that the ::pickup command wouldnt accept codes higher than 10000, i tried fixing it, but had no luck..

Any suggestions?
