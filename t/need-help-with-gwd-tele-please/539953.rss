    <title>Need Help With GWD Tele PLEASE</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-gwd-tele-please/539953</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, I know teleports are one of the basic things to code, but I am very new to all of this. First off I am running TrisidiaX V3 cache/client/source and jdk 7.45. As most of you know, GWD is fucked. I cba to completely redo it so I have chosen a spot to relocate them for the time being. I want to change my tele so that it when I click Boss Teleports and then Godwars, a dialogue box will appear and ask me to choose from the 4 different bosses then tele me to the cords I chose. I have been all over youtube and google but everything is so outdated. Been trying for hours to get this to function properly haha. Help REALLY appreciated. Thanks -Dillon :D</description>

</aside>
<p>Just follow the earlier steps to get the clicking to work:</p>
<p>[quote=“sk8rdude461, post:2, topic:539953”]So ClickingButtons.java, make sure you have some debugging after the “public void processPacket” that looks kinda like:</p>
<p><code>
if(c.playerRights == 3) {
     System.out.println("Button Clicked: " + actionButtonId);
}</code><br>
Now the variable may not be the same since Trisidia handles his buttons stupid.</p>
<p>Next, sign into an account that has playerRights 3, and click the button for your godwars teleport. It should be like 915X.<br>
X meaning it may not be the same.<br>
After you get the ID, search it in your clickingbuttons.java</p>
<p>You’ll probably get something like:</p>
<p><code>
case 915X:
if(c.dialogueId == 123) {
    //Doshit
} else if (c.dialogueId == 666) {
    //Do other shit
}
break;</code><br>
And so on, to find out the dialogueId or dialogueAction it’d be in DialogueHandler.java, and search for the text on your dialogue.<br>
It’ll look similar to:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case 456:
     sendOption4( "option 1", "option 2", "option 2", "option 4);
     c.dialogueId = 456;
     break;</code></pre>
<p>You want the c.dialogueId variable, that’s how you know what one to change in ClickingButtons.java</p>
<p>Good luck.[/quote]</p>

but I searched that and couldn’t find anything anywhere. I didn’t find anything in my ActionHandler file. so I searched Godwars and found <code>case 50253:
