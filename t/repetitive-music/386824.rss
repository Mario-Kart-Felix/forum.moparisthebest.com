    <title>Repetitive music</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/repetitive-music/386824</link>
    <description>I got REALLY bored and saw some a video of the &quot;Ozzy Osbourne - Crazy Train&quot; intro done with redstone and music boxes, thought it was really neat so I decided to figure out how it works (making it play by itself, instead of using pressure plates), and well I came up with a rather neat &quot;song&quot; (like 4 seconds long atm, but it re-plays by itself :)). Anyways, without further adew, I bring you, My song. Please, if your not going to appreciate research I did (actually just the fucking around I did) and possibly learn from it, don&#39;t say anything at all. I guess that&#39;s just another way of saying what alot of people have been told, &quot;If you don&#39;t have anything nice to say, don&#39;t say anything at all&quot;.
