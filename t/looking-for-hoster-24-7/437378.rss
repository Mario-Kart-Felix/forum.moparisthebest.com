    <title>Looking for hoster [24/7]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-hoster-24-7/437378</link>
    <description>Hey, I am a co-owner of a Project Insanity Private Server and have been working on a this source with the owner and we have reached pretty far already. 

We are maxing at 11 players hoping to go upto 20 by 2moro night and have an average of 4 players on at all times. 

We have our website + webclient + voting + donations + etc setup and all we need is someone to host. Our previous hoster has to leave for military school and we will be left without someone to host. At the moment we can only afford a vps for one month and would be amazing if we could get a hoster to host for another 1-2 months so that we can build up our donations...
So far with donations we have only been able to accumulate 60$. 

Website: [url=http://paragonx.webege.com/]http://paragonx.webege.com/[/url]
Home: [url=http://paragonx.webege.com/forum/]http://paragonx.webege.com/forum/[/url]
Forums: [url=http://paragonx.webege.com/forum/index.php?/index]http://paragonx.webege.com/forum/index.php?/index[/url]
Webclient: [url=http://paragonx.webege.com/forum/webclient.html]http://paragonx.webege.com/forum/webclient.html[/url]

So now as a reward for being our hoster, you will recieve many things..

Admin Rank on server and Mod rank on Forums.. 
Admin Rank on our server includes 80% of owner commands.
As soon as we get a VPS your rank will not be taken from you unless it is necessary.
Excess donations are split among&#39;st Development Team (Coder + Founder + Hoster)

Our requirements for a Hoster are not that high:
Computer Specs:
RAM: 6GB+
Processor: 2.50Ghz +

Internet Specs:
Preferably Wired Connection
Bandwidth: Unlimited
Upload Speed: 5 mb+
Download Speed: 30mb+
Ping: Between 2 and 25

Willing to pay 7$/mo if Overall Specs surpass the requirements by a lot.
If you are ready to host, please comment your specs and your skype name with it. 

Thanks, Shame.</description>

The ping depends on the server its connecting to, and how the hell is it ‘1’?<br>
I dont think 2 computers in my my house could get a ping of ‘1’…</p>

Wha…? i can run linux on 500mb of space with 6 gb, and it will still be faster than windows ever will. Physical space (most of the time) has nothing to do with speed.</p>
