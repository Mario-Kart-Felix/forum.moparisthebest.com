Kind of. Basicly, you schedule what kind of match you want, and at what time. Say I want a match at 3:00 P.M. tomorrow, 4 vs. 4. I click the matchmaker, fill out the details, a clan will accept the match <em>If they are interested</em>, and the name of the clan will pop up on the match tab, with the leader’s in-game name. You add the leader in-game and talk to them and such to get it all organized. I need to implement it somehow so it would teleport both clans to a special area, 2-3 minutes after the scheduled match time. I’m not a good coder at all, still very basic. Anyway, you would fight, report the first match winner, fight again, report the second match winner. If the other team wins one match, and you win the other, then there is one more match to determine the winner <em>A default of 2/3 matches, or you can pick 5 matches, where the first team to win 3, wins the entire tourny with that clan</em>. The scores, and feedback from the other team is calculated. If they give bad feedback, not many will want to VS that team. If they give good feedback, many will VS them, as they understand that they don’t cause much trouble (Ex: Reporting false scores). If anything does happen like that, you request a live chat session with a referee, or admin, who can fix the problem, if there is valid proof ( A picture after each win or something like that ). If there is no proof, the match is canceled, as if they didn’t show up, and their feedback falls down.<br>
[/quote]There is a fatal flaw in your system. ‘Reporting scores’ is just retarded. Why rely on people to report their own scores and give proof? It completely nulls any functionality this might have. Use an external library and send the information directly to MySQL… But even if you did that, all of this could be done server sided, and it would still be much easier for people to do. Not only that, but server-sided you could verify that a player/clan even exists, and stop potential spam that might occur on the website.[/quote]</p>
<p>I was talking with a friend of integrating it server sided, atleast the wins/losses part. That’s a bit to hard but I’ll talk to him some more on it.</p>
