    <title>1st EVER RSPS With working ladder system!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/1st-ever-rsps-with-working-ladder-system/345970</link>
    <description> Hello. I think this is amazing. I am Sam, the owner of PvP Turf(PT). My brother, who codes forums, sites, and ladders for game/band websites, created a really cool ladder system with his friends. We put it up on our site, as we do own some copyright in it :). This ladder system, I believe, could be worth up to $500, even more. I&#39;m not sure at this time. I think this is a HUGE advancement in RSPS, and I will ask my brother&#39;s team if they want to sell it on my site to RSPS&#39;s and gain a hefty percentage from gains. This is truly AMAZING, In my opinion.

We will edit the logo&#39;s soon. We have started already. Don&#39;t try leeching. You&#39;ll never find all of the databases :D.

Creators: Mrtms, Brendon, &amp; Some other people, I don&#39;t know the rest :p.
Please post what you think below, and don&#39;t flame. Tell me if you think this is cool or not. I&#39;m going to try and make a system for the wars, and an area to conduct them. I gurantee runescape will copy RSPS once they see how advanced we are. Comment below! (Tbh, I don&#39;t know much about HTML/PHP coding, and such like that. I know basics, haha)

[b]I see quite a few of you are interested  :P. If you want the link, private message me.[/b]

This is a small portion of pictures from the ladder system. 

EDIT: A friend of mine, who does most of the coding for PvP Turf, donated an unused vBulletin license. I&#39;m planning on redoing some of the ladder design.</description>

Kind of. Basicly, you schedule what kind of match you want, and at what time. Say I want a match at 3:00 P.M. tomorrow, 4 vs. 4. I click the matchmaker, fill out the details, a clan will accept the match <em>If they are interested</em>, and the name of the clan will pop up on the match tab, with the leader’s in-game name. You add the leader in-game and talk to them and such to get it all organized. I need to implement it somehow so it would teleport both clans to a special area, 2-3 minutes after the scheduled match time. I’m not a good coder at all, still very basic. Anyway, you would fight, report the first match winner, fight again, report the second match winner. If the other team wins one match, and you win the other, then there is one more match to determine the winner <em>A default of 2/3 matches, or you can pick 5 matches, where the first team to win 3, wins the entire tourny with that clan</em>. The scores, and feedback from the other team is calculated. If they give bad feedback, not many will want to VS that team. If they give good feedback, many will VS them, as they understand that they don’t cause much trouble (Ex: Reporting false scores). If anything does happen like that, you request a live chat session with a referee, or admin, who can fix the problem, if there is valid proof ( A picture after each win or something like that ). If there is no proof, the match is canceled, as if they didn’t show up, and their feedback falls down.<br>
[/quote]There is a fatal flaw in your system. ‘Reporting scores’ is just retarded. Why rely on people to report their own scores and give proof? It completely nulls any functionality this might have. Use an external library and send the information directly to MySQL… But even if you did that, all of this could be done server sided, and it would still be much easier for people to do. Not only that, but server-sided you could verify that a player/clan even exists, and stop potential spam that might occur on the website.[/quote]</p>
<p>I was talking with a friend of integrating it server sided, atleast the wins/losses part. That’s a bit to hard but I’ll talk to him some more on it.</p>

<p>I think thats funny. Gamebattles isnt huge. Their staff team is volunteers. I was a volunteer on it. They give rewards to the admin who did the most tickets in a month. Please don’t comment saying I’m a liar? How would we know how to make these ladder systems if we’ve never been on/using one?</p>

<p>Whatever. I’m very argumentative. Anyways. Let’s say My clan name is PT Squad. I want to schedule a 1 v 1 match against another team. I go to the matchmaker and fill out the info/time. You can even fill a match for the next day. An example: Today is the 26th, I want to look for a match for tomorrow at 12:00 p.m. I fill out the info in the matchmaker. Meanwhile, another clan is looking for a fight. They go to the find a match tab and look for matches that need a versing team. They found my match for tomorrow at 12:00 p.m. they think they can take us down easy. They accept the match and it is dropped off the board. Then when the time hits, I will make it so you contact a staff member and they tele to an area by doing a certain command like ::cz1 - ::cz50. This way, we will have 50 areas where matches can take place. The matches I believe are best out of 2. If they both win one, there will be one last match. Whoever survives last wins. The teams will report the scores promptly, PT Squad with 2 wins and the other team with one win. After reporting it, they send feedback, telling other clans if this clan is a type of clan you should play, e.g. They swear a lot, 3/5 stars. Currently, we are working on a level and experience point system for clans. The higher level you are, the harder clans you play. Please tell me any suggestions  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> I need a lot more.</p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention. If no staff member supervised the match, and there is a problem, such as lying against scores, you can contact the support team via the livechat software we purchased. All problems are dealt with, especially if proof is provided. Lying teams will be locked. I need to purchase a vBulletin License for the forums to make this work nicer. I don’t want to use illegal vB, I’m totally against it. They deserve the money :p.</p>
