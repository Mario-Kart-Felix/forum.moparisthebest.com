    <description>I am currently trying to set up a server, i have a large friend base amongst the RSPS community yet none of them can code rsps&#39; or deisgn and maintain websites... My friends have turned to me to create a server and to do this i need help...
Alot of them are willing to donate to help me and who ever decides to help me would recieve a part of that money...

Im looking for an experienced coder and some one who is capable of building and maintaining the website, in return they will recieve 10% of all donations made to me, as owner... It would be a part time thing, basicly depending on how good your work is depends how much you get paid :)!

Please post bellow if you would be interested in being a part of my team...
