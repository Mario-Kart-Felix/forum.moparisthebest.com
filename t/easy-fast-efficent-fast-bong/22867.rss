    <description>These are my own instructions to making a fast bong,
Ok you will need:
1.	An empty plastic bottle, preferably Coke lol.
2.	A pin or something able to pierce the bottle.
3.	A skewer or something that is a bit thicker than the pin.
4.	Matches/lighter.
5.	A Joint, or a cigarette if you are doing tobacco.

Ok, now get the bottle, and the pin, and pierce a hole 4/5 of the way down the bottle almost at the bottom, then get the skewer or thin like object and make the hole a bit bigger. A small hole where a bit of water can shoot out, not too much or the water will go very quickly. You can use the lighter to soften the plastic before piercing it just incase you fuck up. Use the lighter to make a hole near the top of the bottle, about 3inches from the top, and the hole an inch in diameter, big enough to fit a cigarette and some oxygen in around it. Then fill the bottle a bit under halfway with water. It’s ok if some of the water comes out. Then light one of your cigarettes/joints. Put it in the hole, letting the water trickle out. This creates a small vacuum effect and does not let any smoke escape your cigarette hole. The area in the bottle will thicken up pretty quickly with smoke. When you are ready take the cap off and place your mouth over the top. Take a massive hit, and you will have so much come out.

I have never actually done it with weed before, but I just did it with a cigarette 5minutes ago, and it’s a billow of smoke.

Enjoy :P :P :P :P :P
