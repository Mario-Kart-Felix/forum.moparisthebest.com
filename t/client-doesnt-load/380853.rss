    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-doesnt-load/380853</link>
    <description>ok im making my server and i downloaded dannyscape client+ source yesterday...since then i edited a few things and it all was working great but then only a couple of minutes ago the client stopped loading. i press the .bat file to run it, but the only thing that happens is that a black box pops up and then exits, and instead of the client then popping up like normal, nothing happens. everything was working a couple minutes ago so idk whats up. also i tried editing the run.bat and making it pause instead of exit but the black box only says  press any key to continue, like nothing is wrong... Help please xD?


Please someone help &gt;.&gt; this is the biggest runescape forums and nobody replies...?</description>
