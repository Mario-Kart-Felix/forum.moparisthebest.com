<p>Islam has existed in some form in the UK for over 300 years. It has probably increased slightly recently (as in the last 50 years or so) but that’s because immigration has been a big thing in our country since WW2 - not just muslim immigration. We invited people here, remember, because our country was in fuckin’ ruins and foreign people had been very helpful. People like to forget that.</p>
<p>This is all again assuming that more muslims is anything to worry about. Study after study has shown that the majority of British Muslims actually identify very strongly with British values, much more strongly than other immigrants on the whole for sure and probably a bunch of the natives too.</p>
<p>Yes, disillusioned teens do (<em>sometimes!</em>) turn into angry adults. It is obviously good to try to dispell nasty beliefs in young people. But you don’t do that by getting all scared of some non existant threat.</p>
<p>Like I said if we can defuse totally valid tension over national identity, I think we can handle this small problem.</p>
<p>The sky isn’t falling folks, the nasty Islam monster does not want to eat you at night.</p>
<p>(Also British immigration is on the decline, and the largest majority of immigrants are actually Indian - but you wouldn’t know that, because your information comes from the scary foreign media who like to portray what a horrible place Britain is.)</p>

This. I know people who are muslim simply because they were brought up to be so, but they feel British and act British. Hit 18 leave home and sack off their religious beliefs for university, beer and women.

<p>That is basically the norm for people that age.  My later high school years throughout college most of my friends were ‘agnostic’, ‘athiest’, ‘buddhist’ or held any number of other beliefs, as they left their ‘rebellious’ stages though, now that we are in our mid twenties, almost all of them are Christian again, whether or not they regularly attend services.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/the.html">@The</a> topic.  In the USA we have amish and mennonites (both christian) who wear nonstandard clothing, and so do some Jewish people.  We would never think about legislating it away, and hopefully we never do that to muslims either.  It isn’t right to take away simple freedoms, regardless of the imagined threat they cause.</p>

<p>Oh of course, and I think it is a brilliant thing we’re moving in that direction. However, according to the census results, after each one - it shows a christian population overwhelming the rest. Now, I personally think that isn’t all that accurate either - many people vote Christian when they don’t actually mean it, they vote it because they feel like they live under Christian values (which isn’t a bad thing) and feel Christian culturally.</p>
<p>I know how misleading these census results can be, my mum simply ticked everyone in my house as “Christian” (I forced her to correct it for me and my sister (No religion)). I can imagine there are many millions in this country that also do that, and even my mum, she isn’t actually a believer as I’ve proved to her many times before but ticks Christian because “She isn’t sure if there isn’t a god”. Which is a stupid reason, but there is only so far I can take it.</p>
<p>My original comment was more about, looking at the best data we have and then saying, on the face of it we are living in a country with a christian majority, why is that any better than a muslim majority? Why aren’t we going through the same scenarios that Lothy envisioned when the muslims become the majority. The bible is full of the same sort of stuff the Quran is when it comes to how people should be treated and punished.</p>
<p>There is a reason that side of the bible was pushed out in the western world and across much of Christian Europe, and it would be the same reason that would stop such scenarios from happening in a Muslim Europe too. We’ve moved on and it is the culture we have that does that, I know many foreign students, most of which are muslims who have come from countries that take religion much more seriously than we do, and take their religious scriptures as literally.</p>
<p>Give them a year of so in this country, and many of them start to change, maybe they’ll keep their beliefs, but they realise that it isn’t in the culture here to enforce that, and they, most of the time, don’t want to.</p>

        <p>Haha, we have mothers with a similar thought process Thug-Life. Mine does the exact same thing with the census.</p>
<p>I totally agree on the Christian culture, but I avoid the phrase as much as possible, as I believe a well educated atheist/agnostic with good morals and ethical principles will be more helpful and useful to society. Christians are happy to help each other out, but a lot of the seem to take the bible and its teachings for granted, by this I mean “I am a Christian, I am a good Samaritan - I’m going to heaven”. Yet if they saw a muslim getting beaten in the street would they help them? I’d like to think they would but many, mormons for one look down on everyone else with that “I might be reasonably kind to you when I do speak to you, but secretly I hate you and know you’re going to hell”. Whereas I’d like to think I’d help anyone regardless of race/gender/religion. (I’m quite introvert, so I always relied on this good nature to make me friends at school)</p>
<p>Again stereotyping a little but I’m sure you/others have similar experiences.</p>
<p>MITB, I for one don’t see how people could uturn back to religion without something traumatic or upsetting pushing it upon them, and in those cases the only reason they probably remained Christian afterwards is because the false sense of hope gave them the confidence they need to get through something. Good on them but self motivation and a rational thought process can achieve the exact same thing. No divine interventions needed <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>Religion will always be a tool for love and a tool for destruction, while those who follow it half-heartedly do no harm it’s always going to be the ones who devote themselves to it that are a recipe for disaster. I do believe religion is a dying organisation though and I welcome that <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>There is a reason that side of the bible was pushed out in the western world and across much of Christian Europe, and it would be the same reason that would stop such scenarios from happening in a Muslim Europe too. We’ve moved on and it is the culture we have that does that, I know many foreign students, most of which are muslims who have come from countries that take religion much more seriously than we do, and take their religious scriptures as literally.[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree, the major religion in a country shouldn’t really matter, as long as no laws are passed trying to enforce that religion.  Which is why countries should, instead of trying to enforce religion, pass laws giving everyone the right to choose their own religion and separation of church and state laws, it’s worked out pretty good for the USA so far.</p>
<p>As far as punishments in the bible vs quran are concerned, I think you are a little wrong on this one.  Yes in the bible there are stories of people being stoned to death for adultery and similar, but they are in the old testament (before Jesus Christ).  Many things in the old testament are flat out changed by Jesus Christ, such as when he was in a town where the people were picking up stones to stone to death a woman caught in the act of adultery, and Jesus stopped them by saying something like “Let he who has never sinned throw the first stone.”, so things like that are a big reason why some things in the bible christians don’t want to enforce.  I may be wrong, but I don’t think the Quran has anything like that, does it?</p>
<p>But, bottom line, is that everyone should be free to choose their own religions, but not to enforce them on others.  Separate church and state and you will be fine!  Don’t legislate the clothing people can wear…</p>

        <p>Before I start responding…</p>
<p>Islam never stated females have to cover their faces, rather they only have to cover their legs, arms and hair. This is to do with being respectful regarding your clothing and things like that, I’m not going to go into too much detail. therefore, they can easily live with such a law, but they are convined it is haram not to cover your face, which makes them enraged. This brings me back to my point of uneducation in the middle east: they seem to be unaware of the fact they do not have to cover their whole face, due to a lack of religious education.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, stupid law is stupid.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:10, topic:390650”]Lol Guy Fawkes.</p>
<p>If muslims don’t like France’s stance on this then here’s an idea: They can exercise their French right to leave the country and live elsewhere.</p>
<p>Seriously, why should people go to another country to live and expect that country to cater to their every whim? Especially when their countries don’t cater to the whims of westerners (anyone remember the British woman jailed in Dubai a year or two ago for having sex out of marriage?).<br>
Some people just need to fit in or fuck off. There are actually people in the muslim communities who are advocating, quite aggressively I might add (with Britain having it the worst imo), for sharia law.[/quote]<br>
How about we pass a law stating that westerners have to cover their face here? If they don’t like it, then they don’t have to come. But don’t you think that’s kind of killing your rights?</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:13, topic:390650”]I’m not saying that France is catering to their every whim. This move by French legislators signals quite clearly that they have the balls to stop beating around the politically-correct bush and actually do something.</p>
<p>I don’t understand how you can be so laid back Mopman. As far as I can tell, Britain is the home of the most extremist, aggressive and obnoxious muslims in all of Europe – many of whom are partaking in the ‘struggle’ to liberate Britain by converting it to a muslim theocracy with sharia law to boot.</p>
<p>If you sat down and explained this to someone innocent and ignorant of the world, such as a child, I imagine their first question would be ‘If the muslims don’t like it in SomeCountry, why don’t they just live somewhere else?’.<br>
Of course, they’ll never go anywhere else because that isn’t an option for them. It’s their duty, as outlined in their book of worship, to spread their religion like a highly infectious disease.</p>
<p>My first instinct when faced with such aggression, as a legislator, would be to write self-protecting and virtually immutable documents (like America’s bill of rights or Australia’s constitution) which require a substantial effort to make even minor changes, and the complete participation of the citizenry.<br>
In fact, this was the mindset of the forefathers of America when they wrote their constitution, and the same goes for Australia’s constitution.</p>
<p>But would that be adequate enough to stop the introduction of theocracy and sharia law in 20 to 30 years time? Because anyone who doesn’t believe that the muslim population is only going to grow in the coming decades is a fool.<br>
They don’t need to be violent, they don’t need to revolt. In time, their numbers will increase such that they have the dominant vote. Would a peaceful practicing muslim vote in favour of an Islamic state? Absolutely.</p>
<p>That article states that the muslim population of France is around 6 million.<br>
There are between 22 and 23 million people living in Australia, so 6 million muslims living here would be half way to passing a referendum (which requires a majority of ‘yes’ votes in a majority of states) that could introduce, and enshrine, sharia law in the constitution of Australia. And if that happened, it’d probably be permanent.[/quote]<br>
So basically you’re just going against the majority, even if they’re Muslims.</p>
<p>Well you’re actually quite wrong there. Not all Muslims want to have the old laws back, mostly because they are now invalid and are not compatible with current times. Again, this brings me back to my point of education… The Middle East is so uneducated, people believe they still need to cut hands off for stealing. That isn’t logical at all; even Omar ibn el Khatab (a great guy in our Religions history) stopped that law when his domain faced starvation, which proves that nothing is set into stone, and that Islam is supposed to be an adaptable Religion which is completely misunderstood by those who claim the old sharia law is the solution to all our problems.</p>
<p>Right now, the situation in Egypt has evolved a bit. They wanted to change the laws a bit, and had a refendrum (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum#Egypt" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum#Egypt</a>) over it. I was personally not for keeping them at all (but what does a 15 year olds vote count for?), because the old laws were full of corruption and gave absolute power to whoever the presidency went to, and limited candidates to people who are pure Egyptian, which doesn’t make any sense - Mubarak was pure Egyptian, yet he stole and ruined the country!</p>
<p>However, the majority actually voted yes - and you see, the majority of Egypt is uneducated. They were lured by the Sheiks into believing that the Muslim Brotherhood is the ultimate solution and that it will bring Egypt to the heavens, just by hearing some propaganda about people who vote no are automatically heretics, etc. and even the voting was corrupt - the voters were marked by two colors, green and black. They claimed green was the color of heaven, and naturally almost everybody agreed to the vote.</p>
<p>My point is, this is the majorities opinion. I may not agree with it, but I will have to follow it because this is what democracy is about, isn’t it? You even put it quite well in your post -</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:20, topic:390650”]Because your culture is centered around a christian status quo and it has been that way for centuries. You are the status quo right now. Even if you are athiest or non-christian, your background is most likely white anglo-saxon or similar.</p>
<p>As archaic as some christians are, you should be grateful for the fact that they’re past cutting off hands and stoning people to death. Many christians are monsters, but that goes a long way towards redeeming themselves in my opinion.</p>
<p>Are you guys really so ashamed of your country’s history that you’re happy to have it tossed to the wayside at some point in the future by people who take advantage of your goodwill? Because that’s how some of you guys come across.[/quote]</p>
<p>inb4 someone quotes the Quran in English: those are intentionally mistranslated to bring the Quran to a harsher light.</p>

I don't agree with it at all, regardless of what you insert between educated and with.
<p>And you are wrong about christians too, one of the most basic beliefs of christianity is that you love EVERYONE as you love yourself, regardless of race/religion/ethnicity or any other property.

<p>“Better” than what they would say? It’s an opinion I’m entitled to, an individual with no religion with the same principles as a religious person would hold no bias at all. Whereas as much as you’ll preach you love everyone one and the same its absolute garbage and if you tell me differently then I’ll just point at any or all of the religious wars for you. You compare me to a radical extremist for saying that? I’ve never pushed my beliefs through violence onto anyone, so there’s a great start for me, I don’t even push my opinion onto people unless they ask or expect it (like this thread).</p>
<p>Neutral allegiance FTW, you were all created from the same cosmic explosion as I was. To me the fact we are all made from the remains of stars that died millions of years ago is more of a bond to my fellow man that a heavily edited book.</p>
<p>I think you passed over the world “education” as if it was given to everyone now-a-days too, that was a key word in that sentence because with a decent education (no religious views set on a child from birth, just scientific education and good principles) the world IMO could be a much better place. It’s just getting that education to the places it’s needed.</p>
<blockquote>And you are wrong about christians too, one of the most basic beliefs of christianity is that you love EVERYONE as you love yourself, regardless of race/religion/ethnicity or any other property.  There are always the few exceptions, as there are everywhere, but there is no need to get into that.  If you really would help anyone regardless of any of those things, then, like it or not, you are practicing christian values.</blockquote>
My point exactly, find me a Christian that follows the values like they should. I bet you know a few but not many. If you knew those few even better, you'd probably know even less. If you yourself believe you follow them perfectly, then I commend you but ask yourself honestly before you tell me you do. 
<blockquote>I think most just realized over the years, looking at all the wonders of life and this world, and all the complete miracles that seem to happen all the time, that there has to be a higher power at work here, it is unconscionable that it could all just be random chance or coincidence.</blockquote>
I honestly cannot answer bring myself to answer this, especially after what's happened in Japan. Not to mention all the people who said God brought it upon them. Great Christians. (Before you say that's a minority, I agree - but kind of goes hand in hand with the above point about people not really understanding their Christian values).
<blockquote>Those that devote their life to religion are a recipe for disaster?  Ridiculous, refer to my first paragraph here...</blockquote>
This was not aimed at Christians, more extreme muslims. It probably would happen in Christianity but as I've been trying to portray so few of you actually bother to follow your religion properly that none of you do devote your lives to it.
<p>I’m not totally against religion, I just see an alternative way of teaching the same morals and ethics minus the fairytales and hopefully the wars.</p>

        <p>The Netherlands is known for it’s freedom of religion. It brought us wealth and knowledge, when countries such as France and Spain prosecuted non-Catholic Christians. But today, this is changing. Last week, a Muslim girl attending a Catholic school (A small part of the north is still quite Catholic), was denied to wear a veil. Why? Because it didn’t fit into the Catholic grounds of the school. So apparently, freedom of religion is biased towards certain religions. I bet a nun would be allowed to wear a veil in that school, because the religion behind the cloth is the right one.</p>
<p>I’m not pro-Islam, I’m anti-religion. But this bullshit about having a Judeo-Christian culture is annoying. Populist politicians such as Geert Wilders blow things out of proportions, and get large amounts of votes. He sees a connection between being Muslim and being a criminal. Yes, there are Moroccan kids who cause problems, but it’s not because of their alleged religion (I doubt they are even practicing Muslims). People who’ve never seen a Muslim suddenly hate them. People who don’t know the difference between a veil and a Burqa want to ban the Burqa because they see it so often; a whopping 150 women wear one! Those people have never seen a Burqa. Ignorance leads to hate.</p>
<p>And all this japping about Muslims wanting to introduce Sharia law in Europe: What about Neo-Nazi’s? They want a National socialistic government, do we fear them too? What can they do? Look at European history: the ‘Rote Armee Fraktion’ was an extreme leftist, and terrorist group. They did horrible things to reach their goals, it lead to nothing.</p>

If somehow a Muslim girl managed to pass the “test” to get into my school, she wouldn’t be allowed to wear her veil. Not because were Christians, and hate Muslims, but because 99.9% of private Christian schools have a uniform, or a strict dress code. You agree that as a student of their school, you will wear what they deem as appropriate, or the uniform etc. If you can’t follow the rules, then you don’t come to school. Simple as that. Either way, no veil for her.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh and im pretty sure a nun’s “veil” isn’t exactly a veil. It doesn’t actually cover your face, but rather raps around behind your head. Where as a Muslim veil covers the face. Could be wrong tho.</p>
<p>I don’t have a problem with Muslims. I have a problem with the extremists tho. But, like with every religion or group, you’re going to have a few “bad apples” making the whole look bad.</p>

<p>I know how misleading these census results can be, my mum simply ticked everyone in my house as “Christian” (I forced her to correct it for me and my sister (No religion)). I can imagine there are many millions in this country that also do that, and even my mum, she isn’t actually a believer as I’ve proved to her many times before but ticks Christian because “She isn’t sure if there isn’t a god”. Which is a stupid reason, but there is only so far I can take it.</p>

<p>I’m in the exact same boat, after joking around asking us if we believed in the FSM or were Jedis I eventually said I was a non-believer, of course she put all of us down as christians and only told me afterwards</p>
<p>the problem seems to be that people have misconceptions about what an atheist is, if you do not believe in a god or gods(or are not sure a god exists but doesn’t believe in one) you are an atheist, it’s as simple as that</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="../../u/lothy.html">@lothy</a> in the 2001 census form, 3.1% stated muslim, 2.1% stated hindu, this isn’t a problem, you should be more concerned about the 0.7% who stated they were jedi</p>

        <p>I’m not too sure of my own views of this, I lean towards opposing the ban, but I see the consensus of the thread and I’ll be the loyal opposition.</p>
<p>You’re all bringing up freedom but you forget that not all freedoms are compatible and you have to choose which ones are more important.<br>
Many muslim women who wear the burka are actually forced to by their husbands. Islam is a religion that comes from olden times and hasn’t changed much. Women are seen are worth half that of a man. In an Islamic courtroom, it takes the word of three women to outweigh one man. In the West we’ve learned that women should be treated equally and I’m sure if it was a white European women being oppressed this way we would be up in arms.</p>
<p>Its a case of two freedoms clashing.<br>
100 years ago when feminists were fighting for the right to vote and work, then again we saw people using religion and holy books to say they shouldn’t work and their place was in the kitchen.<br>
Back then, and today, It was clear to many people that freedom of a women to be equal is more important than freedom of religion.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:20, topic:390650”]Because your culture is centered around a christian status quo and it has been that way for centuries. You are the status quo right now. Even if you are athiest or non-christian, your background is most likely white anglo-saxon or similar.</p>
<p>As archaic as some christians are, you should be grateful for the fact that they’re past cutting off hands and stoning people to death. Many christians are monsters, but that goes a long way towards redeeming themselves in my opinion.</p>
<p>Are you guys really so ashamed of your country’s history that you’re happy to have it tossed to the wayside at some point in the future by people who take advantage of your goodwill? Because that’s how some of you guys come across.[/quote]</p>
<p>There are things to be ashamed of but also many things to be proud of (not necessarily chrisitan though)</p>
<p>In Europe we had the enlightenment. We were lucky enough to be the place where science flourished for 400 years. When we list the achievements of science like tripling life expectancy, flying around the globe in days, going to the moon and discovering our origins we’re actually listing achievements mostly made by westerners.<br>
We also had democracy, a pretty good system that has allowed the march of progress to continue. With democracy we don’t need to kill anyone to change the system. It has brought literacy and education to almost everybody who lives under it. Science is all great but democracy is what brought it to the people.</p>

</aside>
<p>Absolutely true, and I do not particularly like what the veil represents or the reasons for which it is worn.</p>
<p>However, it is not for the legal system to force men to treat their wives with respect. Women (and indeed men) are oppressed in plenty of western friendly ways too. It’s just so outside the scope of what law should be doing.</p>
<p>The fight to undo wrongs commited in the name of religion is a good one to have, but it isn’t one that should be had in a courtroom or the houses of parliament.</p>
