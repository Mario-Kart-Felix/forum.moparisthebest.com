<p>Your stance on the Islamic religion is extremely radical.<br>
You’re ridiculously stupid about whatever you’ve heard about the Sharia. Instead of reading from sources on the internet, it’s better you refer to actually qualified Mufti’s who practice and instruct Muslims and Non-muslims on what Islam offers.<br>
Islam condemns killing or forcing people to accept Islam and join the Muslim Brotherhood. There are extremist Muslims, Christians, Jews and so on. Just that the extremist minority in the Muslim brotherhood get’s a lot more publicity and it’s actions blown out of literal proportions isn’t at all fair.</p>

<p>So basically, if you’re a muslim and you leave your religion, the penalty is death.</p>

<p>This isn’t news to me.<br>
Islam isn’t the only religion to do something like this. Christianity does so as well.</p>
<blockquote>[size=16px][font=Times New Roman]6[b][u] If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine[/u][/b][/font][/size] own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 7 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; 8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: 9 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 10 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath[b][u]sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God[/u][/b], which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 11 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.[size=10pt][font=Times New Roman][/size][size=12pt] [/size][size=10pt][/font][/size]
[size=16px][font=Times New Roman]12 If thou shalt[/font][/size] hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, 13 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying,[b] Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; 14 Then shalt thou inquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you; 15 [u]Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword[/u]. [/b]16 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again. 17 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers; 18 [b][u]When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.[/u][/b]</blockquote>
<p>Now I’m not saying that this makes such an act right though many people have different views on this.</p>
<p>Also, where you have quoted me saying that “Islam condemns killing or forcing people to accept Islam” is in relation to non-muslims accepting Islam. That is something completely different.</p>
<p>Furthermore, The Quran has no direct line indicating that an apostate must be killed. Many Muslim scholars differ to this and it is allowed in certain extreme conditions.</p>
<p>But all this has nothing to do with Lothy’s comments directly.</p>

        <p>Quite retarded if you ask me, you can’t cover your face in public? Oh god. What happened to human rights, freedom, etc. I believe if it’s their religion, why not let them wear those veil things.</p>

Your stance on the Islamic religion is extremely radical.<br>
You’re ridiculously stupid about whatever you’ve heard about the Sharia. Instead of reading from sources on the internet, it’s better you refer to actually qualified Mufti’s who practice and instruct Muslims and Non-muslims on what Islam offers.<br>
Islam condemns killing or forcing people to accept Islam and join the Muslim Brotherhood. There are extremist Muslims, Christians, Jews and so on. Just that the extremist minority in the Muslim brotherhood get’s a lot more publicity and it’s actions blown out of literal proportions isn’t at all fair.</p>
<p>I hope you have somewhat read shariah compliant articles to comment so harshly.[/quote]<br>
Then what does the Koran say about ‘infidels’, and how they should be dealt with? Also, are you disputing the harshness of sharia law, or my view that sharia law should never ever be welcomed in countries like Britain and Australia?</p>

<p>Narrated Ikrima: Ali burnt some people and this news reached Ibn 'Abbas, who said, "Had I been in his place I would not have burnt them, as the Prophet said, ‘Don’t punish (anybody) with Allah’s Punishment.’ No doubt, I would have killed them, for the Prophet said, ‘If somebody (a Muslim) discards his religion, kill him.’ "</p>

<p>So basically, if you’re a muslim and you leave your religion, the penalty is death.<br>

<p>This isn’t news to me.<br>
Islam isn’t the only religion to do something like this. Christianity does so as well.</p>

<p>Now I’m not saying that this makes such an act right though many people have different views on this.</p>
<p>Also, where you have quoted me saying that “Islam condemns killing or forcing people to accept Islam” is in relation to non-muslims accepting Islam. That is something completely different.</p>
<p>Furthermore, The Quran has no direct line indicating that an apostate must be killed. Many Muslim scholars differ to this and it is allowed in certain extreme conditions.</p>
<p>But all this has nothing to do with Lothy’s comments directly.[/quote]</p>
<p>“Haha, look at those Christians, they’re just as bad as us!”</p>
<p>Christianity is bollocks too.</p>
<p>I posted because you were trying to defend the indefensible. You accused Lothy of having an extremely radical view and I wanted to defend that view.<br>
We need to use <span class="bbcode-i">reason</span> to decide how to live our lives not superstition, mumbo-jumbo and religion.</p>

        <p>I’m not defending the indefensible.<br>
His views are ridiculous. His cheap satire of deforming names in a mere attempt to indirectly damage the image of a religion isn’t right. If Lothy was trying to have a rational and reasonable argument, it didn’t seem like that to me.</p>
<p>Well, Islam forces no one to accept the religion by force. Yes, there are a handful in this world who force people but that shouldn’t be used to draw the complete picture of the Muslims of the whole world or to use what the extremists of Islam do to paint the entire canvas of what Islam is.</p>
<p>You, quite truly, have a choice to choose.</p>

<p>Whether that’s a failing of the religion or not is another matter, but it’s quite obvious that most don’t.[/quote]<br>
And here comes a back flip on my part. The A3 (formerly athiest) society at my university, which I’m a member of, had a meeting to discuss a large mosque that is to be built in a town here called Elermore Vale.<br>
We spoke of the reasoning for and against the mosque, the main reasoning against being so-called traffic problems in the area. There was a belief that closet-racists were jumping on the ‘but it’ll cause 9999999 more traffic problems’ bandwagon.<br>
I would argue against labeling it as racism, and instead described it as a desire to maintain the christian anglo-saxon status quo. Islamic people aren’t a race, after all, so I wish everyone would stop bandying the word ‘racism’ around like it’s going out of fashion.</p>
<p>I was honest when I stated why I didn’t really support it at the meeting.<br>
My reasoning is that we make a lot of concessions for muslims when they come here, such as freedom of religion and access to places to worship.<br>
I pointed out that certain Islamic countries make no effort to reciprocate those concessions, which is true.<br>
I cited a story about a British woman who was arrested and jailed in Dubai (99% sure it was Dubai) for having sex outside of marriage.<br>
They couldn’t even just deport her; they took punitive action against her based on religious rules that, as a non-muslim and non-adherent, shouldn’t even apply to her.<br>
I also pointed out that non-muslim women are forced by law to wear muslim garments that cover the body and face in muslim-dominate countries, which I believe isn’t so different from forcing muslim women to not cover their face.</p>
<p>A day or two later I started talking about it with a friend. She’s from Bangladesh, and has an Islamic background. She’s not really an adherent anymore though, and tends towards secularism and atheism.<br>
I mentioned to her that someone at the A3 meeting said that the muslims that use the mosque in Wallsend (which is apparently a small shed) also use the two neighbouring churches to pray. This was a surprise to me because, as you’ve noticed in this topic, my understanding of muslim culture is that it is of relentless and unbending adherence.<br>
So to me, it didn’t make sense that a muslim would pray in the place of worship of another religion. She pointed out that the place of prayer wasn’t important to them.</p>
<p>We also spoke about the countries that enforce covering of the face, even for non-muslims. She said that this was due to deep-seated patriarchy, and not necessarily inherent in general practice of Islamic culture.</p>
<p>The reality is that I trust her, and so I guess my opinion on the building of the mosque mentioned above has moved from opposition to sitting on the fence. I wouldn’t rally for it or anything, but I wouldn’t move to stop it either.</p>
<p>Regarding this topic, I’m not so sure. We spoke of the fact that some women are forced by their male partners to wear it against their will while others do it by choice.<br>
I believe that any male that forces a woman to wear the muslim clothing in France should definitely receive the rather significant fine, and I’m pretty sure that she did too.</p>
<p>As for banning it though, I still think this stems back to 2001 at least a little bit. Especially in places like banks, airports, etc. It’s certainly a security issue in those places; facial coverings completely nullify the effectiveness of CCTV.<br>
Would a middle ground be better? Perhaps. Of course, you could argue that the middle ground (ie, removal of face-covering stuff) was in operation already until the outright ban.</p>
<p>At the end of the day France has as much sovereignty as any other nation, so if we aren’t going to critique certain Islamic countries for their enforced covering of the face then I don’t see why we should critique France for doing the opposite.</p>
<p>On another note: Absolutely everyone agreed that if the mosque is built then no government money should fund it. That probably isn’t surprising though when everyone at the meeting was either an athiest, an agnostic, or an anti-thiest (the group is now named A3, instead of ‘athiest society’).</p>
<p>EDIT: inb4 astonishment at the fact I have friends who aren’t backwater white people living in the 19th century.</p>

        <blockquote>Absolutely everyone agreed that if the mosque is built then no government money should fund it.</blockquote>
<p>I agree, although there should be one policy that applies to all religious institutions: No government funding. Old church buildings should be put in a special fund though, and the government should put money into that fund to maintain the buildings as they are monuments. If people want to follow a religion, let them pay for it. In a country like the Netherlands, where a growing majority isn’t religious, tax money still goes to religious buildings and schools.</p>
<p>It’s sad to see that although most of the Dutch citizens aren’t religious, a strict Christian party, the SGP (<span class="bbcode-b">they deny women passive suffrage!</span>) still has two seats in parliament (out of 150). Because of the tight majority of 1 seat that our government has, the SGP has a lot influence in exchange for their help.</p>

<p>I do not think it is fair that people should have to pay to believe in something when they already contribute to the country any how. I don’t see why they should have to pay more just to believe in a religion, why shouldn’t it come out of what they already pay?</p>
<p>Sure, people who don’t believe in religion pay for it also (as you said churches) but isn’t the point of all this money to go to making the country best for everyone, just because a segment of people don’t believe in what another part of the country does I still think they should show understanding. You also have to look at the issues of imposing this ‘religious fine’ this could spark aggression which will just cost a ton more money anyway. I’m sure everyone in a country funds something they don’t agree with. But I must say, if some people are willing to contribute to it (can afford it without putting them selves at risk) then hell, they can. In the current situation of the world imposing this would make it even more difficult on some people in a country.</p>
<p>Also, without enough funding (depending on how much is put into this new fund) charities, hospitals etc (Not sure if you where including these in the ‘religious scope’ but a ton of them are) will have to close leaving people even more vulnerable and people else where worse off. My view is people who support a religion can pay, or should make some efforts to gather money but the government should really pitch in for vital things, and basic religious services.</p>
<p>Does religion cost that much in comparison with other things which most people disagree with?</p>

<p>I’m sure it has been said on this thread before but I would only see it necessary if the person was in a place such as a bank. But even then it doesn’t rely on your face to catch you if you are going to steal from it, there is many other methods.</p>
<p>I think this is just another way to gain control and monitor over people.</p>

        <p>Freedom is something people think they have but simply do not.</p>
<p>Every religious person who thinks they’re religious because they chose to be are sadly mistaken. You were either taught to be at an early age, or you’re such a naive adult (probably had some kind of traumatic/depressing experience) you resorted to a religion to get through your problems.</p>
<p>Not a bad thing, don’t mean any of that to be insulting, just the truth.</p>

<p>My last question was “Does religion cost that much in comparison with other things which most people disagree with?” many countries have wars going on, which most people don’t agree with but they still pay money to fund the killing of innocent people. The government also lies to protect its own status in wars but people still pay money towards it, right? A prime example of this can be shows in wiki leaks.</p>

This is what the Bible tells you (Except for hiding child molesting), maybe you don’t agree with everything your church says, but you should at least agree with the basis of your faith (The Bible)</p>
<p>About hiding child molesting, I only meant the Vatican (Not members)<br>
Nice episode from Penn and Teller about it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcXBuDuEZTs" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcXBuDuEZTs</a><br>
I’m not saying every MEMBER of the catholic church hides child molesting, I’m saying the CHURCH is doing it.</p>
<p>You’re right, your money shouldn’t be used to kill innocent people either, everyone outside US knows that US isn’t the greatest country in the world when it comes to morality.</p>
<p>You’re argument seems to be that, since we give money to one bad thing, we can give money to another bad thing.</p>
