<p>Islam started in Saudi Arabia, the most holy place in Islam is Mecca which is in Saudi Arabia. Non-muslims aren’t even allowed to visit. So you’d expect the purest, most untainted form of Islam to be in Saudi Arabia.<br>
Yet when we go there, we see all women (even non muslims) are required by law to wear a burka and are treated as second-class citizens.</p>

<p>Just replace “man” and “woman” with “white” and “black” and you get to 1960s racially segregated America.</p>
<p>Also, its interesting you bring up Muhammad’s wives when one of them was just nine years old!</p>
<blockquote>For the Western mind, perhaps the most disturbing fact about Islam is that its founder had a sexual relationship with a nine-year-old girl. Because of this, it has become increasingly popular in some circles to refer to the Prophet of Islam as a "pedophile."</blockquote>

Many muslim women who wear the burka are actually forced to by their husbands.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Absolutely true, and I do not particularly like what the veil represents or the reasons for which it is worn.</p>
<p>However, it is not for the legal system to force men to treat their wives with respect. Women (and indeed men) are oppressed in plenty of western friendly ways too. It’s just so outside the scope of what law should be doing.</p>
<p>The fight to undo wrongs commited in the name of religion is a good one to have, but it isn’t one that should be had in a courtroom or the houses of parliament.[/quote]</p>
<p>Well it already happens even in the UK. It seems we’ve already decided that the law should help women (and black and gay people) achieve equality.<br>
Wife-beating is treated differently than just common assault and it carries a harsher penalty. An employer found to be anti-woman sexist can be taken to court.<br>
This french law makes wearing a burka on the street punishable by a €150 fine, but forcing a woman to wear a niqab or a burqa is punishable by a year in prison and a fine of no less than €15,000.</p>
<p>You might think it’s not the laws place to help with the struggle for equality, but that has been the legal consensus for nearly 30 years now.</p>

<p>Yea, you’re wrong. A veil only covers the hair, you’re talking about a Burqa which only leaves the eyes open, but hides the eyes behind a mesh.</p>

<p>She shouldn’t go to a catholic school then. I go to a Christian school in America (inb4 IgnorantChristfag.) If somehow a Muslim girl managed to pass the “test” to get into my school, she wouldn’t be allowed to wear her veil. Not because were Christians, and hate Muslims, but because 99.9% of private Christian schools have a uniform, or a strict dress code. You agree that as a student of their school, you will wear what they deem as appropriate, or the uniform etc. If you can’t follow the rules, then you don’t come to school. Simple as that. Either way, no veil for her.</p>

<p>Don’t you meant “any non-Christian schoos nearby”? Anyway, it is the same with me, I’m atheist on a Christian school, but are very open about my (dis)belief and my opinions on gay rights (To the point people are suspecting me to be gay).</p>
<p>This laws in France reminds me somewhat of the anti-gambling laws in Norway. Just because someone have problems no one should be able to gamble (The banks have been restricted to transfer money to anything related to gambling)</p>
<p>Making something illegal isn’t always the best way to do it…</p>

What if there aren’t any Christian schools nearby? Should the girl travel a lot daily to get something she has a right to? We have a right to education and we have freedom of religion.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Don’t you meant “any non-Christian schoos nearby”? Anyway, it is the same with me, I’m atheist on a Christian school, but are very open about my (dis)belief and my opinions on gay rights (To the point people are suspecting me to be gay).</p>
<p>This laws in France reminds me somewhat of the anti-gambling laws in Norway. Just because someone have problems no one should be able to gamble (The banks have been restricted to transfer money to anything related to gambling)</p>
<p>Making something illegal isn’t always the best way to do it…[/quote]</p>
<p>You’re right, thanks.</p>
<p>At least in the Netherlands, Christian schools aren’t that focused on Christianity anymore. Some teachers pray in the morning, but you don’t have to participate. And you get religious education, which doesn’t only cover Christianity but also Islam, Buddhism etc… Although the teachers usually are Christians, which means they are biased towards Christianity.</p>

<p>The case is somewhat different here, you have to be a Christian to work at this school, and every day we have a word for the day (mandatory of course, but praying is only optional). And the biology teacher doesn’t believe in evolution and teach against it. We also have rules that prevent schools to pretend to be a Christian school (Since it is strict rules for who are allowed to start private schools.)  The main reason I attend to this school is that my parents didn’t like the milieu/social set at the public school. <span class="bbcode-b">So it is many reason for people of another religion to attend to a Christian school, so to those who don’t like people of another religion on your school:  “Don’t be selfish.”</span></p>

<p>Not just a shame, its also illegal and unconstitutional.<br>
Yet with recent estimates most science teachers don’t teach it properly.</p>
<blockquote>Most U.S. high school biology teachers "fail to forthrightly explain evolutionary biology," finds an educator survey. And at least 13% "strongly support" teaching creationism.</blockquote>
http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/01/evolution-teaching-poor-/1
<p>Creationists have lost in the courts but they put pressure on teachers to peddle mythological fantasies into science classes where they don’t belong</p>
<p>But don’t worry, as religious people will constantly remind you science, evolution and religion are 100% compatible.</p>

        <p>I’m seriously going to put this argument on a notepad text file and copy/paste it every time… The Islamic world is currently uneducated, with a complete lack of knowledge about Islam and principles of Islam. Women are not meant to be treated as second rate citizens, and Islam always preaches equality between humans.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is the greatest example of how Islam has gone down through the times. In a place where murders, crimes, thefts and violations of natural laws occur daily, all hiding behind the mask of Islam, don’t expect to find the true side of Islam there. The Islamic world has a lot more to learn before it starts showing the true colors of Islam, and these colors are not the violent, racist colors you see and hear about everyday.</p>
<blockquote>Also, its interesting you bring up Muhammad's wives when one of them was just nine years old!</blockquote>
It's also interesting http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B4%D8%A9_%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%AA_%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%8A_%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%B1 (arabic wikipedia) mentions there are multiple sources and that it is an issue which cannot be resolved because dates were simply not documented at that time. I also read several others that stated the same thing.
<p>How would you judge something that happened nearly 1,500 years ago by the standards of today?</p>

<p>Not really, sharia law is not even supposed to be followed these days, simply because it is not compatible anymore. Theft is no longer a poor person attempting to steal a loaf of bread; it has evolved and become more sophisticated, and sharia laws can not be used. For example, in Egypt, they sent people who worked in the government to jail. The reason they were sent to jail was, when they had businesses they wanted to start, they would always pick companies they had “shares” in, leading to keeping all the profits to themselves and keeping that company the biggest in it’s branch of business.</p>

Actually I am of the idea evolution did happen, but God started it. Also, religion runs on a basis of faith, so you can’t tell a person to prove his god is there.</p>

I disagree to this very common religious argument against the need of evidence. "Faith" has to be proven to your God does it not? Through prayer, through worship and through study of holy scripture? You must perform these acts of faith in order to enter your "heaven" (forgive my generalisations, I use Christian words since most here are Christian). I would go as far to say that you prove your faith in God. So, there is evidence for your faith in God, in the things you do. Regardless and despite this - there is no evidence for God, and there is no evidence in God's faith in you and nothing you do can prove otherwise. So this seems a little unfair that you must prove your faith in God, but God doesn't even show you proof enough so that you can be sure he exists.

        <p>[quote=“ytuio9, post:53, topic:390650”]I’m seriously going to put this argument on a notepad text file and copy/paste it every time… The Islamic world is currently uneducated, with a complete lack of knowledge about Islam and principles of Islam. Women are not meant to be treated as second rate citizens, and Islam always preaches equality between humans.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is the greatest example of how Islam has gone down through the times. In a place where murders, crimes, thefts and violations of natural laws occur daily, all hiding behind the mask of Islam, don’t expect to find the true side of Islam there. The Islamic world has a lot more to learn before it starts showing the true colors of Islam, and these colors are not the violent, racist colors you see and hear about everyday.[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s not a coincidence that Islamic nations are uneducated. Whenever a people become educated they see the universe for what it is and throw away their outdated bronze age superstitions.</p>
<p>OK if you’re so sure, where would I find the true side of Islam?<br>
All the Muslims who aren’t homophobic and sexist I’ve read about are living in the west because they’ve been influenced by Enlightenment values of human rights, pluralism and liberty. Are you suggesting the west is the true face of Islam.</p>
<p>This sounds like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">no-true-Scotsman fallacy</a>.</p>

<p>It’s also interesting <a href="http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/عائشة_بنت_أبي_بكر" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/عائشة_بنت_أبي_بكر</a> (arabic wikipedia) mentions there are multiple sources and that it is an issue which cannot be resolved because dates were simply not documented at that time. I also read several others that stated the same thing.[/quote]</p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence that Aisha was prepubescent.</p>
<p>See this website for a thorough analysis <a href="http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha%27s_Age_of_Consummation" rel="nofollow noopener">http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Aisha's_Age_of_Consummation</a> I quote from it.</p>
<p>For example, only pre-pubescent girls were allowed to play with dolls. Not recording dates doesn’t matter when the girl herself says it happened when she was nine.</p>
<blockquote>“My mother came to me while I was being swung on a swing between two branches and got me down. My nurse took over and wiped my face with some water and started leading me. When I was at the door she stopped so I could catch my breath. I was brought in while Muhammad was sitting on a bed in our house. My mother made me sit on his lap. The other men and women got up and left. The Prophet consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old. Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>How would you judge something that happened nearly 1,500 years ago by the standards of today?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Moral relativism underlines this statement. This is the belief that what is seen as accepted morals change over time.<br>
However, Islam is utterly inconsistent with moral relativism.</p>
<p>Muslims are quick to point out immorality around the world, especially in the West. It seems, then, that they are suggesting a very inconsistent message. When confronted with an immoral practice in another culture, Muslims cry out in one accord, “We condemn these practices, for they are against the eternal, perfect, and unalterable Law of God!” Yet, whenever the moral character of Muhammad is being scrutinized, Muslims suddenly say, “Don’t judge Muhammad! You should remember that he was from a different culture! Marrying young girls was common in Arabia, and it still is, thanks to Muhammad’s precedent. Different people have different moral standards, so no one should worry about Muhammad’s sexual relationship with a nine-year-old girl.”</p>
<p>This convenient switch from moral absolutism to moral relativism is logically unacceptable. If it is wrong to judge the practices of another culture, then both Muhammad and the Qur’an were wrong for condemning immoral practices in Arabia. But if condemning immoral practices is acceptable, then Muslim apologists need a better response to criticisms of Muhammad’s relationship with Aisha.</p>
