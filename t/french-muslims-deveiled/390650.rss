          <blockquote>
              <blockquote>Two independent researches carried out recently at the Texas A &amp; M University and by Canada's Food Inspection Agency discovered that a method called Pneumatic Stunning (in which a metal bolt is fired into the cow's brain and followed by a pulverising burst of 150 pounds of air pressure) delivered a force so explosive that it scattered brain tissue throughout the animal's body. The findings are really disturbing since brain tissue and spinal cord are the most infectious parts of an animal with Mad Cow Disease which causes Swiss cheese like holes in the brain of the infected animal. It is all the more alarming because 30 to 40 per cent of the American cattle are stunned by pneumatic guns before the slaughter.
<p>As for the most modern method of electric stunning being practiced in many developed countries, the Meat Inspection Branch of the United States Department of Agriculture came to the following conclusion in 1953: “The use of electric stunning methods by plants which operate under federal meat inspection has not been permitted as a result of experiments which were conducted several years ago at the University of Chicago. These experiments indicated that electric stunning in hogs resulted in certain changes in the tissues which could not be differentiated by gross examination from similar changes produced by disease.”</p>
<p>In 1955 the Danish Ministry of Justice issued a circular, which said, “Stunning with electricity causes extravasations in meat, sanguinary intestines and fracture in the spinal column, pelvis and the shoulder blades through shock. The blood in the meat makes it more susceptible to putrefaction and has a detrimental effect upon its taste. The properties of the meat which would co-operate with the salt in extracting the blood traces are interfered within the animal undergoing shock convulsions prior to slaughter.”</p>
<p>In 1954 British regulations were amended and electric stunning was prohibited, “the reason being that stunning seriously affected the quality of British bacon.”</p>
<p>It was also observed: “Electric stunning hastens the onset of putrefaction in meat. The explanation of the phenomenon lies in the high lactic acid level following electric shocks prior to bleeding. High lactic acid alters the bacterial resistance of meat.”</p>
<p>If the head of the animal is severed by one sharp blow through guillotining or Bali at the sacrificial post, there will be sudden contraction of voluntary muscles, which will expel important nutrient fluids and, as in electric shock, some lactic acid will also form. What is more, since the heart will stop suddenly, there will not be sufficient bleeding which is needed for better and healthier meat.</p>
<p>It is evident from the above-mentioned studies that the Islamic slaughter of animals is a blessing to both the animal and the person who consumes it. It may, however, be mentioned in this connection that the Islamic method insists on several measures to make the slaughter lawful.</p>
<p>This is done to ensure maximum benefit to both the animal and the consumer.</p>
<p>The holy Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) emphatic declaration in this regard should be mentioned first. The holy Prophet (pbuh) said: “Allah calls for mercy in everything, so be merciful when you kill and when you slaughter: sharpen your blade to relieve its pain.”</p>
<p>According to a tradition transmitted by Muslim, the Apostle of Allah (pbuh) ordered a horned ram with black legs, a black belly and black round the eyes, and it was brought to him to be sacrificed. He told Bibi Ayesha Siddiqua (RA) to get the knife, and then told her to sharpen it with a stone. When she had done so he took it, then taking the ram he placed it on the ground and cut its throat.</p>
<p>The Islamic method indeed demands that the knife to be used for slaughtering animals must be sharp and used swiftly. The swift cut of vessels of the neck disconnects the flow of blood to the nerves in the brain responsible for pain. Thus the slaughtered animal feels no pain.</p>

              <blockquote>German Research Studies Pain
<p>It therefore may come as a surprise to those who have made such acclimations to learn of the results of a- study carried out by Professor Wilhelm-Schulze and his colleague Dr. Hazim at the School of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover University in Germany. The study: ‘Attempts to Objectify Pain and Consciousness in Conventional (captive bolt pistol stunning) and Ritual (Halal, knife) Methods of Slaughtering Sheep and Calves’ concludes that Islamic slaughtering is the most humane method of slaughter and that captive bolt stunning, practiced in the West, causes severe pain to the animal.</p>
<p>In the study, several electrodes were surgically implanted at various points of the skull of all animals, touching the surface of the brain. The animals were allowed to recover for several weeks. Some animals were then slaughtered by making a swift, deep incision with a sharp knife on the neck cutting the jugular veins and the carotid arteries as well as the trachea and esophagus (Islamic method). Other animals were stunned using a Captive Bolt Pistol (CBP). During the experiment, an electroencephalograph (EEG) and an electrocardiogram (ECG) recorded the condition of the brain and the heart of all animals during the course of slaughter and stunning.</p>
<p>The results were as follows:</p>
<p>I - Islamic Method</p>
<ol>
<li>The first three seconds from the time of Islamic slaughter as recorded on the EEG did not show any change from the graph before slaughter, thus indicating that the animal did not feel any pain during or immediately after the incision. 2. For the following 3 seconds, the EEG recorded a condition of deep sleep - unconsciousness. This is due to the large quantity of blood gushing out from the body. 3. After the above-mentioned 6 seconds, the EEG recorded zero level, showing no feeling of pain at all. 4. As the brain message (EEG) dropped to zero level, the heart was still pounding and the body convulsing vigorously (a reflex action of the spinal cord) driving a maximum amount of blood from the body thus resulting I in hygienic meat-for the consumer.</li>
</ol>
<p>II - Western method by C.B.P. Stunning</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The animals were apparently unconscious soon after stunning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EEG showed severe pain immediately after stunning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hearts of animals stunned by C.B.P. stopped beating earlier as compared to those of the animals slaughtered according to the Islamic method resulting in the retention of more blood in the meat. This in turn is unhygienic for the consumer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Western-Style Slaughtering and Mad Cow’s Disease</p>
<p>Not only is this method of stunning animals before the slaughter severely painful as shown by the previous experiment, but there is also a rising concern that this method may be a factor in the spread of mad cow’s disease from cattle to humans as it was discovered in recent research carried out at Texas A&amp;M University and by Canada’s Food Inspection Agency, that a method called pneumatic stunning (which is the firing of a metal bolt into the cow’s brain followed by a pulverizing burst of 150 pounds of air pressure) delivered a force so explosive that it scattered brain tissue throughout the animal. This news is disturbing since the brain tissue and spinal cord are the most infectious parts of an animal with mad cow disease, which causes fatal Swiss cheese like holes in the brain of the infected animal. It is more disturbing to find out that around 30 to 40 percent of American cattle are stunned by pneumatic guns. Islamic Regulations for the Slaughter</p>
<p>As one can see from the previous studies, Islamic slaughtering of animals is a blessing to both the animal and to humans alike. In order for the slaughtering to be lawful, several measures must be taken by the one performing the deed. This is to ensure the highest benefit to both the animal and the consumer. In this regard, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: “God calls for mercy in everything, so be merciful when you kill and when you slaughter: sharpen your blade to relieve its pain”.</p>
<p>The object used to slaughter the animal should be sharp and used swiftly. The swift cutting of vessels of the neck disconnects the flow of blood to the nerves in the brain responsible for pain. Thus the animal does not feel pain. The movements and withering that happen to the animal after the cut is made are not due to pain, but due to the contraction and relaxation of the muscles deficient in blood. The prophet (peace be upon him) also taught Muslims neither to sharpen the blade of the knife in front of the animal nor to slaughter an animal in front of others of its own kind.</p>
<p>The cut should involve the windpipe (trachea), gullet (esophagus), and the two jugular veins without cutting the spinal cord. This method results in the rapid gush of blood draining most of it from the animal’s body. If the spinal cord is cut, the nerve fibers to the heart might be damaged leading to cardiac arrest thus resulting in stagnation of blood in the blood vessels. The blood must be drained completely before the head is removed. This purifies the meat by removing most of the blood that acts as a medium for microorganisms; meat also remains fresh longer as compared to other methods of slaughtering.</p>
<p>Therefore accusations of animal cruelty should very rightly be focused on those who do not use the Islamic way of slaughtering but prefer to use those methods which cause pain and agony to the animal and could also very well cause harm to those consuming the meat.</p>
</blockquote><br>
Now I’m not saying that all other ways of killing animals are painful and cause suffering, but according to this the uslamic way of slaughtering isn’t that bad after all.

<p>Wrong, halal meat is cut with a sharp knife then left to bleed to death. Causing a swift painless death (by cutting the spinal cord perhaps) is discouraged.</p>

<p>The important point is that some scholars recommended that slaughtering performed from the back of the neck be avoided, because the results in cutting the spinal cord, and thereby killing the animal, before the actual slaughtering.</p>

<p>Secular slaughter methods use gases to suffocate the animals or kill them instantly with a metal shot to the head.</p>

<blockquote>In Britain, it is a crime to kill a conscious cow or sheep or chicken for meat by slashing its throat without numbing it first. The reasons are obvious. If you don’t numb an animal, it screams as you hack through its skin, muscle, trachea, oesophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins and major nerve trunks, and then it remains conscious as it slowly drowns in its own blood – a process that can take up to six minutes. So we insist that an animal is stunned before its throat is slashed, to ensure it is deeply unconscious. There isn’t much humanity in our factory farming system, but this is – at least – a tiny sliver of it, at the end.
<p>But there is a loophole in the law. You are allowed to skip all this and slash the throats of un-numbed, screaming animals if you say God told you to. If you are Muslim, you call it “halal”, and if you are Jewish you call it “kosher”. Back in the Bronze Age, or the deserts of sixth-century Arabia, it was sensible to act this way. You needed to know your meat was fresh and the animal was not sick, so you made sure it was alive and alert when you killed it. As Woody Allen once said, it wasn’t so much a commandment as “advice on how to eat out safely in Jerusalem”. But we have much better ways of making sure meat is fresh and healthy now. Yet for many religious people it has hardened into a dogma, to be followed simply because it was laid down in their “holy” texts long ago by “God”.</p>

Lothy you have no more right as to how Australia is governed than any other Australian citizen. Anglo-Saxon or not, the majority of Australians are immigrants and if one day the Muslims are a majority, democracy is how we run things here.

<p>Every country have its bloody past, that doesn’t mean that the modern citizens is responsible for the past (Thats Christianity). Lothy have a point here, non-western immigrant are overrepresented in crimes. When you come to another culture you should become a part of that culture and not become a criminal outcast.</p>
<p>From 2006-2008 was there 41 assault rape in Oslo (Our Capital), all committed by non-western immigrant. So good is the Islamic religious and cultural influence.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t have your hand cut off for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are under the age of puberty</li>
<li>Stealing is different from robbery. I can’t be assed researching but IIRC in sharia law you don’t lose your hand for petty theft. I was once told it is specifically when you break into a safe or a location that serves the same purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sharia can be harsh in some areas like robbery, murder, drugs and out of marriage sex when you are married. However in other cases, Sharia law can be laid back i.e out of marriage sex when you are not married.</p>

She asked the class whether or not evolution was a <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-u">theory</span></span>. Divided the class into yes or no groups. And tried to get them to argue their points. Half the class argument was simply “the bible” and the other was simply the disbelief in the bible. I was the only one who didn’t even bother to get up to participate. Remember they were arguing whether or not it was a theory. They didn’t seem to understand that. I felt bad for every student who fell for it. Dick move from the teacher funny as hell tho. Kinda makes me worry about humanity. These were 9th and 10th grade students. I sort of expected more. Needless to say everyone sure did look real dumb afterwards.</p>

This is what the Bible tells you (Except for hiding child molesting), maybe you don’t agree with everything your church says, but you should at least agree with the basis of your faith (The Bible)<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>In my experience of religious people (Catholic, Christian mainly etc) most of them don’t go to Church, only read the Bible when they have to. They mainly base what they do in life of the 10 commandments.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><a href="http://www.the-ten-commandments.org/the-ten-commandments.html%5B/quote%5D" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.the-ten-commandments.org/the-ten-commandments.html[/quote]</a></p>
<p>lets have a look at some of these so-called moral principles that Christians base their lives from.</p>
<blockquote>1 	“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have no other gods before Me.</blockquote>
<p>So number 1 tells you to believe in God.</p>
<blockquote>2 	“You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My Commandments.</blockquote>
<p>So God doesn’t want you to make an image of anything, if you do he’ll punish not only you but your children and your children’s children. Sounds moral.</p>
<blockquote>3 	“You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.</blockquote>
<p>Oh for God’s sake!</p>
<blockquote>4 	“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. [b]For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day.[/b] Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.</blockquote>
<p>Shame it’s not mentioned that universe was formed 9 billion years before the Earth formed. Pity it forgets to mention we were not made by God but evolved gradually through millions of years.</p>
<blockquote>5 	“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.</blockquote>
<p>No exceptions? Even if they mistreat you?<br>
Luckily modern society has rejected this, every christians accept that a government has a duty to take away children from obviously bad parents.</p>
<blockquote>6 	“You shall not murder.
7 	“You shall not commit adultery.
8 	“You shall not steal.
9 	“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.</blockquote>
<p>So now at number 6 we get to the really important ones. They arguably should’ve been number 1.<br>
They’re nothing special either, every single culture in the whole of human history has had these (except number 7 since some are polygamous)</p>
<blockquote>10 	“You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor's.”</blockquote>
<p>Don’t know if you knew but coveting is what capitalism is based on.<br>
Whoops, looks like consumer spending just dropped to zero!</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the things the 10 commandments miss out.</p>
<p>They don’t say that slavery is wrong, in fact countless passages in the bible suggest slavery is okay including words that Jesus apparently said.</p>
<p>They also don’t acknowledge the equality of women, the language that tells you to “not covet your neighbour’s wife” implicitly suggests that the reader is a man. The fact that it lumps a wife alongside other possessions such as a house, donkey and ox suggest that women are seen as mere property.</p>
<p>In summary, its simply wrong to suggest that anybody gets their morals from the ten commandments. You get them from the same place everybody else does.</p>

<p>Though it may not be directly related, I was just pointing out that it doesn’t really echo down the line to normal people.</p>
<blockquote>Tom_BETA: The Catholic teaching is based upon the authority of the Church, if you don't take it as your authority, why call yourselves a Catholic?</blockquote>
<p>People may listen to the authority, but that doesn’t mean they have to do everything as commanded (What the authority says). Find people who do that and fair enough but I’ve never encountered such things. It’s not like the Catholic authority has everyone in a trance.</p>
<p>Though this is my view point from what I’ve seen. I wouldn’t accept it. But again, many people don’t and still call them selves Catholic, I guess that’s how religion works now days?</p>

An old teacher of mine, who is catholic once said to me “I’ve never had an issue with my God, but I have had many things I don’t support from the Church”. I think that’s fine. Why should someone have to support everything a man says to believe in God?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Where do you think the bible came from? Your entire post is laughable because of the answer to this. Although you’re not the first Christian I’ve met to this fall into this pitfall.[/quote]</p>
<p>aha, didn’t see that one coming.</p>
<p>Why should someone have to support <span class="bbcode-b">everything</span> a man says to believe in God?</p>
<p>No one I’m aware of supports everything said in the Bible, people in modern day especially don’t.</p>
<blockquote>How did we get the Bible? Where did the Bible come from? The Bible itself claims to have come from the most High, from God Himself (2 Timothy 3:16)</blockquote>
<p>How can you prove/disprove it? Yeah, you could be right but at the same time you could be wrong. I guess it’s a leap of faith? There are also reportedly scriptures which back up this (I’ll try and find them later).</p>
<p>Religion is a leap of faith, you believe in a higher power (God) which created everything. If you don’t want to condone everything an authority says you can still be religion, it’s faith not fact as people would say. But I have to admit that’s a really good counter argument.</p>
<blockquote>Do you met many religious people? I have met people who thinks the rainbow has no natural explanation. So I think we two have seen religious people in different ways.</blockquote>
<p>I go to a catholic school, for the Catholic pupils which go there, you have a small minority (if any) who actually take it to far, then everyone else just accepts science is science. I accept what can be proven.</p>
<p>It’s just I also accept faith in things. I’m not an insane religious nutter, I never go to Church, I don’t care if someone doesn’t like what I support. Burn a Bible, what ever. If it can be proven wrong, then I accept that. But until it’s proven wrong I still have faith.</p>
<p>Science is fact, religion is faith. That’s just how I see it.</p>

<p>Not at all, I know many people who don’t condone what the pope says. Everyone has beliefes which are separate from their religion. It’s not like the pope says something and it is immediately accepted by everyone in that religion.</p>
