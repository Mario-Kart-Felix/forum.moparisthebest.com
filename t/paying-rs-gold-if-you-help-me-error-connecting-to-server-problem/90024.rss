    <title>Paying RS Gold if you help me! Error connecting to server problem!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-rs-gold-if-you-help-me-error-connecting-to-server-problem/90024</link>
    <description>Well the title IS true, I am paying rs gold but only 150k. (Better than nothing right?) Anyways, whenever I try to log in something it gives me that message of &quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down. Click start new server and log in again&quot; Well I did that and guess what, it didn&#39;t work. So I heard something about this hamachi thing, I&#39;m not sure exactly what it is but I don&#39;t really want to download it. If anyone were to help me out by posting I am willing to pay. I am willing to try anything but download more things. Thanks for all your help! Hassan

P.S. Also please do NOT email me for the answer. I would prefer posting but pm if you have to. Thanks again!</description>

              <p>If that happens i suggest that you do this download<br>
Hamachi at Hamachi.cc<br>
then download it and blah…<br>
the go to advertisments and find one using Hamachi …<br>
then go to join server and type in something ex . Ashley_PK<br>
pass - 123</p>
<p>then it tells you an ip in the advertisment ex. 5.139.158.32<br>
also it tells you a port - ex. 43594</p>

              <p>Ok herse my lecture:</p>
<p>Hamatchi is a program for joining networks, certain servers have hamatchi some dont example mine. The reason that doesnt work is as said before the 127.0.0.1 server has been down, its the main moparscape server thats started when you pull up moparscape. If your having this problem joining another server its because the server is down due to crashing, restarting, or just they had to turn server off.</p>
