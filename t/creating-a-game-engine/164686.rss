    <title>Creating a game engine?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/creating-a-game-engine/164686</link>
    <description>Hello, my friends and I have an idea for a game. I will be doing the work, they are there for mostly &quot;funding&quot; and &quot;support&quot; :P. Anyways, I am planning to create a new engine [I know it&#39;s a lot of work but I really want to], but having just started C++, I have nowhere to go/know not what to do. If anyone could help me out, it would be very much appreciated :)
Thanks
Justis
PS
No posts saying you can&#39;t do this you&#39;re gonna fail its not possible etc etc</description>

              <p>Yes, I understand that [now :P] and am using Irrlicht, unfortunately the people who were supposed to be artists are either: A) Finding Excuses to not do anything B) Trying to push Multiverse on me. I might just do this alone as originally planned…<br>
I’m learning C++, its seems pretty simple because I’m so used to java.<br>

              <p>You should probably start using an Open Source engine first, you can even make commercial games with most of them.<br>
As Avalanche said, Irrlicht is a good one, and relatively easy to use. If you want one with better graphics, you could also go for Ogre3d or CrystalSpace. But have in mind that, for making a 3D game, basic C++ knowledge is not enough. You need to actually know, at least, all the main features of C++, and know how to use them effectively, and some programming experience and maths knowledge is also important.</p>

your don’t need a game engine, instead you could just code the game…<br>
oh fk thats a game engine, isnt it? but srsly, if your good at cache editing, you could just take moparscape and transform it, prob take a year for 3d stuff and crap to work but you could get it to work…<br>

The math is simple: SDL + OpenGL + An Object Wrapper + Design Team + CrapLoad of Money == Game</p>
<p>For the general public, there’s modding. See id Software’s open sourced quake engine for linux/windows… A modified quake source could be goldsource which is valve’s original release of half life… Or for the most to date engine, look up the Source engine from valve, it’s completely free, with the only constituent that your game has to be free.</p>

<p>Errm, may I ask why? DX10 is the same as DX9, they’re all backwards compatible, just have different requirements. An API is still an API, regardless of how much it is updated. Perhaps you are saying that because you don’t have a DX10 compatible GFX card?</p>

Spark3d? I remember that from a while ago, I wanted to use it but I never got time… have the graphics gotten better? Last time I saw it they were moderately outdated, but still pretty good.<br>
