    <description>How would i go about GURANTEED pvp drops, for example, if a player was killed he would drop all of his items INCLUDING an extra 1M in coins even if he did/did not have it in his inventory?

And is there any way to change what is being dropped depending on the person who is dead&#39;s combat level?</description>
