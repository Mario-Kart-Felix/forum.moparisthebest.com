    <title>Looking for RSPS developer! Great opportunity</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-rsps-developer-great-opportunity/540841</link>
    <description>Hello guys I am Montana94 and I am currently in search of a RSPS 718+ developer that is willing to work with me on a long term project coding and running a Runescape Private Server. I already have a 4gb SSD windows VPS and I also have a website ready. 

Requirements:
Maturity
Creativity
Time management skills
Dedication and interest in the project
Communication skills

Additional Info:
	Creativity is a must for this position, as our goal will be to create a unique server. Dedication to the project is also required, as we are looking to establish a long term server in which the players can enjoy a fantastic gaming experience. Communication skills are important in any workplace, especially so when working in an online environment. As face to face communication may not be possible, regular communication through skype or other media will be required. This project will require a modest amount of time to begin, and daily work will be encouraged. 

	If you feel you are qualified please do not hesitate to contact me. If you can code and you have the passion and desire to make a successful and flourishing server then look no further . Not all applicants will be selected but ALL candidates will be very carefully considered. So please do not hesitate to apply, you have the opportunity to be a part of something GREAT. Application is optional, but highly recommended unless you want to talk on skype as an alternative. I look forward to hearing from potential candidates.
