<p>Sorry I couldn’t fix your problem man, but if you are having any more scripting problems be sure to post them here. Me, or someone else will help you…</p>
<p>The only possible Errors you could be getting now that I can think of are:<br>
-HowManyDrops is set to 0.<br>
-Your starting the script logged out.</p>
<p>But we already went through both of them, and it didn’t help…</p>
<p>Try Re-downloading the script?</p>
<p>P.S. You are not wasting my time. I enjoy helping people with SCAR. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Alright, I wil give you a detailed explanation of what the script does, and why you might be getting a problem.</p>
<p>The script starts off by setting all the counters to 0.<br>
It then disguises SCAR as ‘NotePad,’ and Sets up SRL.<br>
Next the script finds the axe colors (which it did for you.)</p>
<p>The script then starts a Procedure called the MainLoop; The first like in the Main loop is <span class="bbcode-b">if (Not (LoggedIn)) then break;</span> which will break out of the loop if you are not logged in, so you MUST start logged in.</p>
<p>Then the script starts a Procedure called <span class="bbcode-b">SetupPlayer;</span> The first line of <span class="bbcode-b">SetupPlayer;</span> is NextPlayer(true);.</p>
<p>Try replacing your <span class="bbcode-b">SetupPlayer;</span> procedure with this:</p>
<p><code>Procedure SetupPlayer;
begin
  AxeColors;
   Wait( 2122 + Random( 100 - 5 * 2 ));
    PerfectNorth;
     SetChat('hide', 1);
     SetChat('off', 2);
     SetChat('off', 3);
    SetRun (true);
  GameTab(4);
end;</code></p>
<p>All I did was remove NextPlayer(True); But the script will still work fine either way…</p>
<p>I think this will fix your problem. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>Alright, here is how I get the script working.</p>
<p>-I set it up, using the script you posted, and changed the TreeType to ‘Tree’;</p>
<p>-I set the crosshairs, and brought the runescape client into focus. I logged in my player, and positioned him by some ‘Trees.’</p>
<p>-I pressed Control+Alt+R to start the script.</p>
<p>-The player manager form popped up, and I set the player I am using to ‘Active.’ I also set up his password, and NickName. The Location (Mine), and Skill (Iron) do not matter for this script, those are old settings. Notice how the Username is tutmi… and the NickName is three letters of it, that are not capitalized (utm.)<br>
<img src="http://img388.imageshack.us/img388/6568/settingsfl4.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>-This appeared in the SCAR debug box, showing that the script had succesfully started:</p>
<blockquote>Loaded 7 users from chars.srl
Wrote 7 users to chars.srl
There is 1 active users
Getting Axe and Handle colors...
Axe colors: 595562  7631997  6119013
Handle color: 942465</blockquote>
<p>-The script rotated the screen to Perfect North,  and set my chats to Hide, Off, Off.</p>
<p>-The script then Set MY character to run, and started chopping down trees.</p>
<p>Here is my character:<br>

WaitTime     = 5000; // Waiting time between each Smash aka Chop<br>

HowManyDrops = 5;      // Will Tree-Smash and after dropped the ammount of loads, will change player</p>

<p>Try making a player called katyluice21 or something, and then make the NickName 3 letters (not the first letter, only lowercase ones.) See if that works. May take a while, but it might fix your error.</p>

              <p>First of all, Nicknames are not the whole name.</p>
<p>You have the whole name, subtract one letter. Nicknames cannot include spaces, try 120, or something. I have never tried numbers, so I am not sure if these accounts will even work for solving randoms. That may actually be the problem, because I once had an accounts called 0 r l y 0, and whenever I ran a script, the nickname would havs spaces in it, and he would log out.</p>
<p>I hope that helps solve your problem!</p>
