    <title>[667] TokHaar-Kal issues</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/667-tokhaar-kal-issues/447112</link>
    <description>Hey guys, basically I&#39;ve made the TokHaar-Kal able to equip but then later realised that it has no stats whatsoever. What I was wondering is, as I&#39;m rather new to coding RSPS&#39;s I don&#39;t know how to edit the stats of certain items.

If anyone could tell me how to edit the stats of the TokHaar-Kal I would appreciate it. Thanks (:
