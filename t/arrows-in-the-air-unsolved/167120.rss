    <title>Arrows in the air... (UNSOLVED)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/arrows-in-the-air-unsolved/167120</link>
    <description>Hi. I was wondering if anyone here knows how to make an arrow fly through the air.
I&#39;m trying to implement it into my attack method if the player is using range.
I&#39;ve seen on other servers, the arrow is loaded in the right direction, and it flys straight through the air at the enemy.

On my server, the arrow always loads facing south, no matter what direction you are facing, and instead of flying straight through the air, the graphic of the arrow loading loops, causing a weird bumpy shot.

If anyone knows ANYTHING about this, please post.
It would be... Greatly appreciated.... ++

Thanks,
Unborn</description>

              <p>Lol ok… I currently use createProjectile(casterY, casterX, offsetY, offsetX, 50, 95, 18, 43, 0, Lockon);<br>
Caster X/Y being coords of the shooter, offsetX/Y being the distance, 50 the angle, 95 the speed, 18 the iron arrow graphic, 43 start height, 0 as the end height, lockon as the target.<br>
But it still fires ‘wonky’, and draws back south…</p>
<p>Any ideas on how i could fix this?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 23, 2007, 06:22:39 AM[/size][hr]Also, if anyone knows of a server source with working arrows that i could study, please let me know…</p>

              <p>No, there are no others, apart from ogre arrows, you need to make a createprojectile(absX, absY, offsetX, offsetY, angle, speed, GfxId, startHeight, endHeight, lockon, slope); and call it through graphics handler, that createprojectile i just wrote in the quick reply box, so i doubt its right lol.</p>

Sounds like you’ve just got an animation number wrong.</p>
