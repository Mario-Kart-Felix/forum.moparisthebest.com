    <title>[Dementhium] Achievements Base for ALL Skills</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dementhium-achievements-base-for-all-skills/520784</link>
    <description>Well, got bored and needed something to motivate players some, so I made up this new Achievement system that allows an individual achievment for every skill (minus combat skills...meh). The idea behind this was to basically influence both skillers and pvm/pvp playersto get more involved through this system. So far, it seems very nice and it rewards the players fairly well. It can, of course, be adjusted to your needs or your likings, as i know my skills probably arent the best, best who honestly uses a boolean[] like i do 

Anyway, lets get started. First, we must create the main SkillGoals.java, in any package you like. Just make sure to change the packaging at the top once you have it placed where you need it.

[CODE]package org.evo.content.custom;


import java.util.List;
import org.evo.cache.Cache;
import org.evo.model.player.Player;
/**

public class SkillGoals {


    private final int[] goal = new int[SIZE];
    private final boolean[] complete = new boolean[SIZE];
    public static final int SIZE = 18;
    
    /**
     * Displays the Menu to show what&#39;s been completed.
     */
    public void openGoalMenu() {
        player.getAction().sendString(275, 2, &quot;Skill Accomplishments&quot;);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; SIZE; i++) {
            player.getAction().sendString(275, (i+16), &quot;&quot;+goalNames[i]+&quot; (Status: &quot;
                       +(player.getSkillGoals().isComplete(i) == false ? &quot;&quot;
                        +player.getSkillGoals().getStat(i)+&quot;/300&quot; : &quot;&lt;col=FF0000&gt;Completed&quot;)+&quot;)&quot;);
        }
        player.getAction().sendInterface(275);
    }
    
    /**
     * @param stat
     * @return number of items for that goal completed
     */
    public int getStat(int stat) {
        return goal[stat];
    }
    
    /**
     * @param stat
     * @return true if that goal is completed
     */
    public boolean isComplete(int stat) {
        return complete[stat];
    }
    
    /**
     * @param the stat id
     * @param true/false
     * Sets goal completion to true/fase
     */
    public void setComplete(int stat, boolean t) {
        complete[stat] = t;
    }
    
    /**
     * @param goalId
     * @param amount
     * Sets a certain goal to a specific amount
     */
    public void setGoal(int goalId, int amount) {
        checkRewards(goalId);
        goal[goalId] = amount;
    }
    
    /**
     * @param skill
     * If the goal is not marked as completed, and over 300, we flag complete as true
     * then give a reward to the player. Easy as that.
     */
    public void checkRewards(int goalId) {
        if (complete[goalId] == false &amp;&amp; goal[goalId] &gt;= 300) {
            complete[goalId] = true;
            player.sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=FF0000&gt;You have completed: &quot;+goalNames[goalId]+&quot;.&quot;);
            player.sendWorldMessage(&quot;[News] &quot;+player.getDisplayName()+&quot; has just completed: &lt;col=FF0000&gt;&quot;
                        +goalNames[goalId]+&quot;&lt;/col&gt;!&quot;);
            player.getSkills().addExperience(goal[goalId], 2000);
        }
    }
    
    /**
     * List of Goals, Purely Cosmetic for the Menu.
     * You can change these however you want, but the length
     * MUST remain the same.
     */
    public static final String[] goalNames = { 
        &quot;Cook 300 Fish&quot;, 
        &quot;Cut 300 Logs&quot;, 
        &quot;Fletch 300 Bows&quot;, 
        &quot;Catch 300 Fish&quot;, 
        &quot;Light 300 Logs&quot;, 
        &quot;Craft 300 Items&quot;,
        &quot;Smith 300 Items&quot;, 
        &quot;Mine 300 Ores&quot;, 
        &quot;Make 300 Potions&quot;, 
        &quot;Cross 300 Obstacles&quot;, 
        &quot;Thieve 300 Times&quot;, 
        &quot;Slay 300 NPCs&quot;,
        &quot;Farm 300 Times&quot;, 
        &quot;RuneCraft 300 Runes&quot;,
        &quot;Build 300 Structures&quot;, 
        &quot;Hunt 300 NPCs&quot;, 
        &quot;Make 300 Pouches&quot;, 
        &quot;Kill 300 Dungeon NPCs&quot;
    };
    
    private Player player;
    /**
     * @param player
     * Sets the above
     */
    public SkillGoals(Player player) {
        this.player = player;
    }
}


[/CODE]

Imports there may also need changed up alittle bit, because i&#39;ve repackage Dementhium alittle bit. Anywho, now we need to open Player.java and add this:

[CODE]private SkillGoals sgoals = new SkillGoals(this);

public SkillGoals getSkillGoals() {
        return sgoals;
}
[/CODE]

Now i know this doesn&#39;t seem like much, but i thought someone might be able to expand off this and make something incedibly great. Not really sure if this was a good way of doing it, but meh. I literally spent a few hours implementing ALL skills with this. So all those listed in goalNames, is what is done in my own server.

To get each goal to save, you first need to open Player.java, and look for this:

[CODE]public void save(ChannelBuffer buffer) {[/CODE]

Now, at the VERY bottom of this method, just above the }, we need to add this:

[CODE]for (int i = 0; i &lt; SkillGoals.SIZE; i++) {
    buffer.writeInt(getSkillGoals().getStat(i));
    buffer.writeInt(getSkillGoals().isComplete(i) == true ? 1 : 0);
}
[/CODE]

Epic use of a ternary right?  Anyway, this will save each int[] to your data. Reason this has to be at the end is to ensure that all the data is saved in certain order, then loaded in the same exact order, otherwise you will get very uncessary results.

Next, we need this stuff to load. So again, at the END of this method:

[CODE]public void load(ByteBuffer buffer)[/CODE]

We will need to add this. And the reason we do buffer &gt; 0 is because we dont need it to load on existing profiles without this data. Without the check the save wont load and god knows what else.

[CODE]if (buffer.remaining() &gt; 0) {
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; SkillGoals.SIZE; i++) {
        getSkillGoals().setGoal(i, buffer.getInt());
        getSkillGoals().setComplete(i, buffer.getInt() == 1 ? true : false);
    }
}
[/CODE]

Now then, you could probably do this a different way, but for each skil whenever you craft an item and get exp, or smith, etc, you will need to add this where the code is at when the action is sucesful:

[QUOTE]int statLevel = player.getSkillGoals().getStat([b]SKILL_ID[/b] - 7);
player.getSkillGoals().setGoal([b]SKILL_ID[/b] - 7, statLevel + 1);[/QUOTE]

Reason why we subtract 7 from the [b]SKILL_ID [/b]because we start at Cooking, which has the ID 7, and in the SkillGoals.java, it starts at 0, not 7, since its the first skill without combat. Then we do the statLevel+1 to increase the curent objective by 1. (just thought of a better way to do this...but meh....)

Anyway, im pretty sure that was it. Hope someone finds use for this &gt;_&gt;</description>
