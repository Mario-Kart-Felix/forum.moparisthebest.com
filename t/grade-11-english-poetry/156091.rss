-This is connected to the theme[/b]
I have typed it exactly how its in my book 

Title of poem: Where I Come From 
                    Poem By: Elizabeth Brewster

People are made of places. They carry with them 
hints of jungles or mountains, a tropic grace
or the cool eyes of sea-gazers. Atmosphere of cities
how dirfferent drops from them, like the smell of smog
or the almost-not-smell of tulips in the spring,
nature tidily plotted in little squares
with a fountain in the centre; museum smell,
art also tidily plotted with a guidebook;
or the smell of work, glue factories maybe,
chromium-platted offices; smell of subways
crowded at rush hours.

                                Where i come fromm people 
carry wood in theie minds, acres of pine woods;
blueberry patches in the burned-out bush;
wooden farmhouses, old, in need of paint,
with yards where hen and chickens circle about,
clucking aimlessly; battered schoolhouses
behind which violets grow. Spring and winter
are the mind&#39;s cheif seasons: ice and the breaking of ice

A door in the mind blows open, and there blows a frosty wind from fields of snow.

thx in advance</description>

              <p>I think this poem talks about people’s conformity and different ways of life, and about how they behave differently based on their environment. hope it helps  ;D</p>
