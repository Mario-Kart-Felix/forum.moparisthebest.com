    <title>MSFSX: Acceleration Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/msfsx-acceleration-help/190331</link>
    <description>Hello,
I installed MSFSX onto a portable hard drive a while ago.
I have recently gotten Acceleration, and would like to install it, but I cannot figure out how to change the path that it install to with. I tried changing the registry, but it did not work. I also tried copying the files to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X, but that did not work either. Can anyone help?
Thanks
Justis
EDIT
Fixed, for anyone that still needs help, use [url=http://www.flight1software.com/files/FS_Registry_Repair.exe]FSX Registry Repair[/url].</description>
