              <p>Sounds like multiple connections to a VPS that’s only meant to handle one connection caused your VPS to time out. It should be back to normal in a few hrs. Don’t try to connect via RDC for awhile though. Let it drop old connections.</p>
<p>Orrr, it could have just crashed. &gt;.&gt;</p>
