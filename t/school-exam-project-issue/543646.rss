    <title>School Exam Project Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/school-exam-project-issue/543646</link>
    <description>Hi dere,

This is written in PHP, Html and Css just so you know. It&#39;s a web exam.

So basically im having an issue with solving this problem basically, I have to create a exam for my school.

The problem is that the exam has 40-50 questions, if a user was to do the exam would I need 40 rows in the user database to store what they selected? How would I do it? &lt;3 Also, if a student was to dissconnect mid exam how would I be able to store the students answers so they can come back to where they left off.

Thanks - Frantix</description>

<p>user:<br>
user_id<br>
user_name</p>
<p>questions:<br>
question_id<br>
question_test</p>
<p>answers:<br>
answer_id<br>
answer_value<br>
user_id // this will be the associated id<br>
question_id // this will link up with the question asked</p>
<p>I’m pretty fucked right now, and skipped half the thread, but… that’d probably be my approach based on the initial post.</p>

              <p>This is how I (personally) would accomplish this issue. If the results are going to be read by you or school administrators, here’s one option…</p>
<p>After all the information has been inputted, on the process page you build a long paragraph containing all the answers.</p>
<p>An example of this would be a database structure like this…<br>
id - information<br>
1 - First Name: JohnLast Name: DoeQuestion 1: Yes</p>
<p>Etc. So when you’re later pulling the information, you can just select the one column as a whole and output it. This wouldn’t be ideal if you want to access the answers individually or pull the answers.</p>
<p>Another option would be building an array from the database, which isn’t really recommended. An example:<br>
id - results<br>
john, doe, yes […]</p>
<p>Then use PHP to separate values.</p>
<p>Without knowing whether or not the questions are just yes/no, involve multiple options, or include text, I wouldn’t be able to provide much support.</p>

<p>Mind fucked aha, the thing is is that it’s just a simple exam for students to sit and get there results at the end. I just need a way to store there answers in a database without having 50 lines in the database. Also I should have put above that it’s programmed in PHP. :S But thanks <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> that was really technical for something so simple.</p>

              <p>Hi dere,</p>
<p>This is written in PHP, Html and Css just so you know. It’s a web exam.</p>
<p>So basically im having an issue with solving this problem basically, I have to create a exam for my school.</p>
<p>The problem is that the exam has 40-50 questions, if a user was to do the exam would I need 40 rows in the user database to store what they selected? How would I do it? &lt;3 Also, if a student was to dissconnect mid exam how would I be able to store the students answers so they can come back to where they left off.</p>
<p>Thanks - Frantix</p>
