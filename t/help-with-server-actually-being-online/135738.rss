    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-server-actually-being-online/135738</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;ve made a server and everything, I portforwarded, and made a no-ip (ex. blahblah.no-ip.biz) and I have a server source file and everything. It&#39;s all set to compile... Well, let&#39;s just say everything is all set and ready to go. I am just confused on how to get it on the internet so people can connect to my server?

All I can do is &quot;localhost&quot; but when I go to another computer and type in the no-ip and server source port it says the server is down.

HELP PLEASE!

Thank-you!</description>

              <p>Again, when I compile the server is this what it’s supposed to look like?</p>
<p><img src="http://i73.photobucket.com/albums/i237/welcom2funkytown/Untitled-1-2.gif" alt width="666" height="336"></p>
<p>and could someone please give me a step to step walkthrough to making the server open to public?</p>
<p>I tried compiling and running the server and keeping it running, going to my router, portforwarding it by typing in the service name, port numbers 5555 and 5555 because that’s what the pimpscape server run says for the port. then typing in for the last IP I type in 192.168.0.1 and press apply or whatever.</p>
<p>Well, here are some screen shots instead. Please help me, I can’t get on my server when it’s running from another computer. Am I supposed to compile the server source to No-ip or something? I know something is being left out. Please help!</p>
