<p>Its not about keeping them in small tanks or to entertain people, its to keep them away from predators and save there species. That’s my opinion.</p>

<p>Why should sharks be kept in tanks? It is not as if removing a few sharks from the ocean will make them less dangerous, not to mention they are a crucial part of the food web.[/quote]<br>

<p>These animals belong in the wild. The idea that it saves it’s species by putting it in a tank is a great example of our fucked up society. Of course, I go to these kinds of parks. I love these animals. But I’d rather see them in their natural habitat. You can put these animals in a tank, or you can prevent assholes from killing them. Clean the ocean. Stop fishing with a net the size of my country. And stop with harpooning them for ‘research’.</p>
<p>But I must say that people like those of Sea Shepherd are annoying fucks that enjoy sniffing their own farts.</p>

<p>How do you justify that? How does keeping an animal in captivity save its species? In the Shamu whales’ (Shamu is the name of the show, several whales have been used) case, they don’t mate (at least, not ideally/how they would normally). I would consider leaving an animal in the wild rather than in captivity (regardless of them being able to reproduce) a <span class="bbcode-b">far</span> better way of ‘saving’ its species.</p>
<p>Why should sharks be kept in tanks? It is not as if removing a few sharks from the ocean will make them less dangerous, not to mention they are a crucial part of the food web.</p>
<p>Why should this whale be killed/let go? It is essentially torture to capture an animal, exploit it for your own monetary gain, and then blame it for killing its (potential) oppressors. What would happen to the whale if it was let go? Consider if it was born/raised entirely in captivity, what would it do? Either route is bad from this perspective, but it would not be a problem in the first place if people were not so fascinated by a ‘lesser’ species kept in a tank, and if the people with the tank weren’t so obsessed with hoarding cash.</p>
