    <title>Webclient Worries :(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-worries/292545</link>
    <description>1.) When i try log on with my webclient, it says error connecting to server, and my server is up i could log on to it with my normal one tho,
Is it because im running it off my Pc? like Localhost?

2.) Well i want to make a website to Publish the webclient onto it, like Moparisbest did, I know u can use Wamp, But how can i publish my Client.jar to that website which im currently making? without out the jar file my webclient says Could not find Class.Client.

Thanks x[)DDDD[)xD</description>
