    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The Chawner family describe the abuse they have had to contend with

They have been lambasted in the press and laughed at by neighbours. Here, the Chawner family, with a combined weight of 83 stones, describe their distress at unwanted attention and abuse.

Emma Chawner is responsible for one of the most famous (or infamous) renditions of Celine Dion&#39;s My Heart Will Go On.

The 19-year-old from Blackburn first came to the nation&#39;s attention two years ago when she first applied for The X Factor.

In a memorable audition, she was roundly condemned for both her dress sense and singing abilities by Simon Cowell.

He described the dress she was wearing as &quot;like a wedding dress, and then you sang the song out of tune and a bit like a baby&quot;.

But Emma and her family say the criticism dished out by the judges is nothing compared to the abuse they have suffered since.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Etc etc, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7970491.stm

What I find funny though, is, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I hope people are going to listen to this. As I say, we do not scoff ourselves with chocolate or any fattening foods, we just eat what we enjoy and we only have one big meal a day.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lancashire Police confirmed that they had received a complaint from the Chawner family about abuse directed at them on the Facebook site.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you&#39;re just eating what you &quot;like&quot;, and having one big meal a day, of course your not going to lose weight. Also, what&#39;s up with being on facebook? If £22k isn&#39;t enough to live on, they shouldn&#39;t be spending it on luxuries.</description>

              <blockquote>The Chawner family describe the abuse they have had to contend with
<p>They have been lambasted in the press and laughed at by neighbours. Here, the Chawner family, with a combined weight of 83 stones, describe their distress at unwanted attention and abuse.</p>
<p>Emma Chawner is responsible for one of the most famous (or infamous) renditions of Celine Dion’s My Heart Will Go On.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old from Blackburn first came to the nation’s attention two years ago when she first applied for The X Factor.</p>
<p>In a memorable audition, she was roundly condemned for both her dress sense and singing abilities by Simon Cowell.</p>
<p>He described the dress she was wearing as “like a wedding dress, and then you sang the song out of tune and a bit like a baby”.</p>
<p>But Emma and her family say the criticism dished out by the judges is nothing compared to the abuse they have suffered since.</p>

<p>Etc etc, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7970491.stm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7970491.stm</a></p>
<p>What I find funny though, is,</p>
<blockquote>"I hope people are going to listen to this. As I say, we do not scoff ourselves with chocolate or any fattening foods, we just eat what we enjoy and we only have one big meal a day."</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>Lancashire Police confirmed that they had received a complaint from the Chawner family about abuse directed at them on the Facebook site.</blockquote>
<p>If you’re just eating what you “like”, and having one big meal a day, of course your not going to lose weight. Also, what’s up with being on facebook? If £22k isn’t enough to live on, they shouldn’t be spending it on luxuries.</p>
