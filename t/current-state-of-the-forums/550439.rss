    <title>Current State Of The Forums</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/current-state-of-the-forums/550439</link>
    <description>Alright, so over time this community has deteriorated a tremendous amount, and all that&#39;s left are the elitist types who have personality disorders and can&#39;t leave or they will develop murderous tendencies, Sk8r and I (for whatever unknown reason), and then beginner/wanna-be server owners and/or developers (sad how I have to include &quot;or&quot;) in a market that is dying slowing as the game it&#39;s based off of is fading away. What has to be done to try to revive the community? Despite how much I&#39;ve said I&#39;ve hated this place or the people in the past four years or so, it&#39;s been a big part of my life, and it&#39;s gotten me to a point in my life where I have alot more options than I would have had without ever being exposed to this community. If the forums never pick back up, and they keep slowly fading away, all I can say is that I&#39;m thankful for everyone who&#39;s ever helped me with my problems all the way from the ignorant &quot;pi coder&quot;, to where I am today.</description>

</aside>
<p>I think this is a side effect of a dying game. If the core game is dying, people are less likely to play forked copies of the game. Image WoW; if Blizzard said “all right guys, we’re done, no more content”, then for a while, a jump in forked servers would occur, and people would flock to those (to try and get their “fix”). But eventually, that too would fade out of existence, because there’s simply no more creativity. All servers would end up more-or-less the same, with the few that would try to innovate, but lack the tools needed. An example would be, if we took the Vanilla WoW, and made servers off of that, because we didn’t have map editors, or the ones we did have, we not fully implemented and prone to breaking.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying that those new servers would never innovate; I’m sure that there are some that would reach the plateau, but then push past it. It may not be Blizzard-quality content, but it would be something. This is what’s happened. People are just taking what Jagex has implemented, and tried to implement it themselves without the right tools (Here’s some wood, and some nails, now build a house with this pebble).</p>
