    <title>Port fowarding+compile errors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/port-fowarding-compile-errors/161634</link>
    <description>I&#39;m new to this community, and only have a little basic knoledge on java files and how to work with them.

Hey, I&#39;ve been searching around in port fowarding posts for quite a while now, and when i go to type in my default gateway into my browser, it redirects me to a google search and has no results, my ip adress and default gateway are the same, i was just wondeirng if i had to edit one of them to get it to work, ive been trying to figure this out for 3 weeks now, it&#39;s probobly something simple and me just being stupid, but I&#39;m new here and have just started to learn the basics about .java files and editing servers. help to this problem would be highly apreciated  

I also can&#39;t get it to compile, i have tried my enviroment variables with a ;.; at the end of each and without, doesn&#39;t work either way, i have jdk 6.3 and everything and don&#39;t know what the problem is.

Thanks</description>
