    <title>Looking to be a 728 Coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-to-be-a-728-coder/469515</link>
    <description>Hello guys, this is probarably the wrong section? Yes but i&#39;m not good with forums and stuff.
 I&#39;m basicly bored, i have alot of free time and i&#39;m looking for a server that is 718-728 and is in need of a coder.
I am [u]NOT[/u] a &#39;Java Programmer&#39; and i am [u]NOT[/u] a brilliant coder. 

I have around 4 years of RSPS experience and 3 years of it based about coding. 
I am 16 years old, yes i started coding when i was around 12- Early 13. 

Please, like seriously, don&#39;t flame or hate - I simply can&#39;t be arsed having arguments with people i don&#39;t know.
Don&#39;t judge? I&#39;m not saying i&#39;m a brilliant coder, but i can make a server worth playing.

Timezone: Whatever a UK timezone is called.

Much love.</description>
