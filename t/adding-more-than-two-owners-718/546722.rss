    <title>Adding More than Two Owners? -- 718 --</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/adding-more-than-two-owners-718/546722</link>
    <description>I&#39;m having an issue adding Two Owners.

I&#39;m not sure how to work this out, But here&#39;s the code:

[code]public static final String[] OWNERS = { &quot;detail&quot; };
[/code]

Now, yes, There is &quot;One&quot; Owner, That&#39;s me.
I want to add my friend to an owner rank, but if I added something like:

[code]public static final String[] OWNERS = { &quot;detail &amp;&amp; scripted&quot; };
[/code]

It wouldn&#39;t work, how would I add two owners, so it would say Detail And Scripted as owners?

I made this sound very weird, I know. But I just don&#39;t understand how.</description>

              <p>You can also make a method return a string to get the “list” of owners…</p>
<p><code>
	public static String getOwners() {
     String ownerList = "";
     for(int i = 0; i &lt; OWNERS.length; i++) {
          ownerList += (i != OWNERS.length - 1 ? OWNERS[i] + ", " : OWNERS[i]);
     }
     return ownerList;
}</code><br>
What that does is it loops through all the Strings in the OWNERS array and adds each String to the ownerList. If the loop its the end of the array (length of array - 1) it only adds the string, if it isn’t, it adds the string with a comma.</p>
