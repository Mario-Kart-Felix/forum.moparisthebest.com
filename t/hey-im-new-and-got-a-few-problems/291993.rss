    <title>Hey, I&#39;m new and got a few problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hey-im-new-and-got-a-few-problems/291993</link>
    <description>I want to make agility to work as perfectly as possible in my server, so I was woundering, there is always a certain percent of failure of agility task, so how would the code look like? And also the code, if you fail, for example fall off from log, and get damage, how would the code look like? Looking forward to your answers :P

Yours,
Kiluf

Edit: Forgot about the problem of Al-Kharids gate, I want to make it work so, that the guards take cash when passing by, for example 500gp? It&#39;s just, that it works only from 1 side lol... Could anyone tell me how to make it work from both sides of the gate, or could you just leave a code or something here? :P</description>
