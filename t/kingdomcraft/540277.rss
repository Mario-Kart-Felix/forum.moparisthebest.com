Looking for a great PVP server? Kingdom Craft is the right place for you! Come on in and join or start your own faction and start your PVP or raiding adventure. We also have a separate world made for mini games. 

Community
Kingdom Craft has a very nice and friendly community. We strive for direct player reflection, this means that players should be the ones to help each other out. Of course, your enemies won&#39;t help you out, but all allies and neutral factions are willing to always help.

Staff
We strive to provide the best gaming environment for everyone – we care about your opinion and take your suggestions into account. All staff are handpicked. There are no applications. This helps us to choose those that are active and provide you with the best staff possible.

Morals
We are not in the business for money. Instead, we are in the business of entertainment. You do have the option of making donations, and with these donations you do receive packages. These packages are our way of saying thank you!

We really hope to see you soon – and remember, this is your adventure.</description>
