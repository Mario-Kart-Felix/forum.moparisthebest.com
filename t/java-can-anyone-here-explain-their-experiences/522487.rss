    <title>Java, can anyone here explain their experiences?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-can-anyone-here-explain-their-experiences/522487</link>
    <description>First of all, sorry for the length but I don&#39;t know how to give a brief summary of this.
I&#39;m all over the place with it. 

So I want to learn java. 
I&#39;ve gotten into it at least ten times. I learn some stuff, but I never actually learn how to apply it. And I just want to know, when you guys were learning java how did you actually practice it? Because it never tells me how to really apply it. Like HelloWorld.
These books tell me the code but they never explain it in depth. I can&#39;t figure out how to apply it to my own sample code for practice if I don&#39;t know what the entire code structure is for. 

    public static void main(String[] args) {

How am I supposed to apply this to my own application, when I don&#39;t understand why there&#39;s [] next to String? Or how am I supposed to know when functions are capitalized or not? I&#39;ve seen it written as string and String. Or how am I supposed to apply this when nothing is telling me why the args has to be there? 
Why does it have to be public and not private? I can&#39;t modify this code if I don&#39;t understand it which means I can&#39;t practice it for more understanding. The only thing I can do to it is change it from sayin hello world to blah blah. That doesn&#39;t mean I learned anything from it. 

Basically, the way I&#39;m learning this doesn&#39;t help me. It&#39;s like learning math. I know that 5^-1 is 1/5 but no one ever gave me a reason for why that actually is true they just said its always 1/n. so I can easily repeat that. 6^-1=1/6. 100^-1=1/100. But I can&#39;t expand on my knowledge if I don&#39;t understand why that&#39;s true. Being able to repeat something doesn&#39;t mean you understand it. 

Again, sorry for this long ramble. I really want to learn java I just can&#39;t figure it out and it irritates me.</description>

              <p>I buy a lot of books and read the parts I am currently interested in, saving the rest for later. Then I usually apply what I learn from them in practice. But, I usually never write the examples from the books that have any, because I prefer to read the theory and think on my own. Before I write any code, I usually think about sound architecture and design. That also includes following any of the well known principles (for instance KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), low coupling and high cohesion, SoC (Separation of Concerns), IoC (Inversion of Control) and SOLID (Single responsibility principle, Open-closed principle, Liskov substitution principle, Interface segregation principle and Dependency inversion principle)).</p>
<p>All the above might not be relevant to you right now. But if you continue and practice you’ll eventually find it relevant at some point in the future. However, I can recommend a book called Introduction to Java Programming (9:th Edition) by Y. Daniel Liang. I have the 7:th Edition. It’s a thick book that covers all you need to know right now.</p>
<p>Currently I have 76 books in programming languages (and other kinds of natural languages for that matter) in my shelf. All ranging from primer books to advanced ones (compiler theory (and language transformation in general), program analysis, neural networks, reverse engineering, computer forensics and malware analysis, OS design and general program architecture and design). If you are interested in any specific area, perhaps I could recommend some more books. I have books within “most” areas. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

</aside>
<p>I would say that learning by example versus lecture versus book is definitely up to each individual, but it’s incredibly difficult and impossible to become a professional programmer without reading about design patterns. Good for mentioning this, it’s often overlooked. Many people seem to miss the other half of software engineering. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

You guys reference RSPS.<br>
I started out with RSPS which is what even sparked my interest in java. I didn’t do really unique things to it though. I pretty much just renamed it to what I wanted and added a customs pack and changed the sprites. All of which I had done by copying code off of here. The hardest thing I think I did was add a server control panel, which I still had just copied from the tutorial section.<br>
But I still don’t think I could achieve any of the things I did without having to copy someones code. How long should you even be copying snippets for before you’re writing your own?</p>

              <p>I would suggest watching a skilled friend while he’s coding with some sort of screen sharing software. I was in a very similar situation to you, as I was poor in areas of application with Java.</p>
<p>But during our current RSPS we’re working on, I just started to watch him code through screen sharing and watching as he wrote things out. I think you’ll find that understand a piece of code is much easier than constructing it yourself, at least that’s how it was for me.</p>
<p>Anyways, after watching for a long time I just became more familiar with what certain things meant.</p>
