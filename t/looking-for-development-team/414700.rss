    <title>[Looking For] Development team-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-development-team/414700</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I am currently looking for a development team to work with,
i would like the team to be done 65%+ Server sided, this 
would intern make my job easier... I would also like the team to
be mature, (In other words not a bunch of little kids) Preferably 15+
and i would like the team to look like it is going somewhere...
And the server should already have fund&#39;s to go toward development.
Also i would prefer the revision 500+

Now here is what i have to offer:
I am a Web Developer, i have been developing website&#39;s for about 6 years 
now. I have an un-used VBulletin 4.1.4 license. I am willing to be pretty much
anyones web developer, considering the above term&#39;s are met. If you need a web
developer, and would like to take me up on this offer and welcome me into your team 
please either reply to the post or send me a PM and we can discuss further.
Please add my MSN: Schitzomniac@hotmail.ca

Best regards,
~Justin</description>
