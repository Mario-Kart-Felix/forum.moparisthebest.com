    <description>Hi everyone... I need a development team to help me work on my new RSC project, Kena Island Resort. The official website is at [url=http://www.kenair.tk]www.kenair.tk[/url]
Here&#39;s Some Screenshots Of What I&#39;ve Got So Far.

I&#39;m making every town an island, so I can connect them with bridges. This is the problem I run into.

I need someone that will remove the objects and the npc&#39;s in the water and the bridge.
Or, just tell me how to remove them! LOL
Download the client below to work on it.

<p>I will gladly answer any questions you may have, point you in the right direction and even help you fix any errors you may encounter (if I am able to), but I will speak for most people when I say this, we will not do everything if you aren’t willing to give it a shot and help yourself first.</p>

<p>Oh, and the dog image? I don’t dig it. Nor do I dig cows that are able to swim. Good luck.[/quote]<br>
Yong, I have done major work on the map. And I am willing to learn how to move NPCs and objects. I have learned, somewhat. I have done hours of work on the map, and when you walk on the bridge from falador to draynor, the post makes some kind of invisible wall, and there are trees all over the stupid bridge. Also, there is a stupid bug, if you click an NPC in the water, you walk on water, kill it, then you are stuck in the water!!! I don’t want people to make the server for me, I just want to make this server the best it can be before I launch the beta. I will try to remove the objects and NPCs with those XML files, but it will be a lot of work. I know a major overhaul on a server is a lot of work. I am willing to do this. Thanks with the help.</p>
