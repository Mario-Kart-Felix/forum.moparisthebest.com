    <description>[b]Okay so here&#39;s whats happening.[/b]

I&#39;m looking for a team to create a massive pvp/mvp server.
what I&#39;m looking for-

614 coder/developer x2.

web designer/forums coder x2.

everyone knows no body likes to play much of the 317 servers anymore because they are just simply not cool enough,
now days everyone is playing the 614+ servers but a few still play 317 servers,
i want to spend about 3 months minimum coding the server making sure everything works, simply have the lastest and greatest pvp&#39;ing equipment + all working bosses. 

Items.
Chaotics
Bandos
GodSwords
SaraSwords
PolyPore Staff
All Nex Armours
All Barrows
All Dragon Armour
Tele Tabs
etc.
pretty much all Runescape items except a few of the very latest ones. 

Bosses.
Full Working GodWars
Barrows
Nex
Corp
KBD
Kalphite Queen
Daggoneth King
Tormented Demons
etc.
everyone knows the bosses.

Know a lil info on the actual server. like most others its eco or spawn, a few of them have spawn/pkp points. i want to create a spawn server with PKP. so like bronze-rune dragon-barrows all spawn. vestas-Nex drag claws-korasi all pkp. 

home i want to be bounty hunter. and work on from there where all skilling training areas will be, id like for people to help with ideas aswell. tell me where they would like to put stuff aswell.

          <blockquote>
              <p>Name- The Web Guy / Real name is AJ<br>
What your applying for- Website/Forums developer<br>
how old you are- 15 years old (never let age fool you)<br>
what you have acheived prior to this- I’ve released several things website related to moparscape, including various different Highscores themes, the entire runescape website (updated one), tutorials, and more. I’ve coded my own social network front to back (took 3 months; reached 60k users in 3 weeks). I also run my own business doing website design, me and a team of employees make fairly good money, I help out people with RSPS sites however, offering free websites/forums for them, in exchange for something in-game or possibly a rank. (Wouldn’t ask for real life money)<br>
country- United States, Wisconsin.<br>
something about yourself- I’m 15, however I usually don’t tend to act my age (I act older), sound my age, or even look my age for that matter. I’ve accomplished quite a bit for age 15, I know everything about computers, branching off into Networking, Website Design, Programming, Hardware, and even some Software. I have my own business with 9 employees that I myself employ. So I tend not to take highschool so seriously, lol.</p>
