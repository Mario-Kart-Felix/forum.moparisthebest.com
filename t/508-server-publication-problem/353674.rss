    <description>ok, well i finished coding my first ever 508 server. I have never used a 508, or no-ip. My friend tried to logon using my reguler ip adress and it didn&#39;t work. So i downloaded no-ip after making a host. i open the no-ip thingy, and then selected the host thing. but then my friend tries using that and it doesn&#39;t work. if it helps i have no-ip open right now, pretty much all the time, and the name is aluminamscape.no-ip.org
