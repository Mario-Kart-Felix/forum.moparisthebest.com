<p>This will work as well.</p>

              <p>The first idea that comes to mind? You can add an ID to your “Killer” method. Then you can use a Ternary operator in a method to determine if It’s the same person. You might want to check your “GetLastKiller, Killer, GetKiller, or something similar” method, it might already determine who the Killer was.</p>
