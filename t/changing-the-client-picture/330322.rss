    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/changing-the-client-picture/330322</link>
    <description>i need help changing the client picture.
i went to my client and went into sprites and then i got the picture and i found the dimensions so i made my picture that big.
and then i looked through the folder and there was a picture called shortcut to original.
so i took that out and made a short cut to my picture.
and then itll just take forever to load and then itll say unable to play.
can someone help?</description>
