    <description>Ok I have a server  and when I try to get on I can, when other people try they can get on but when  more than 4 people try to get on they cant. So my question is how can i make it so more than 4 people can get online at the same time? Also another problem I have is I want to make an object require a member status to be able to be used. Please help me.</description>

              <p>I also meant re-write the sentence in proper english. Right now its a run on and sounds like crap. Say things out loud and read them over before you post, because coming across as an idiot will make the people who know what they are doing ignore you.</p>
<p>Your server is screwed up, even WinterLove servers can get at least 20 people on. (Which in reality is unacceptable; even 1000 players isn’t good, thats still 1/2 of a real RuneScape server.)</p>

<p>You had capitalization errors, loads of typos, and I could barely understand what you meant. For example, you didn’t capitalize your I, and your forgot punctuation. And language shouldn’t be capitalized. And “doesn’t make any scene to lock my post” doesn’t make any sense at all.</p>
