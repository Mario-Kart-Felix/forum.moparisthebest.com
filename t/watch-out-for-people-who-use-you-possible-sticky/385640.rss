    <description>Hello everyone, i am going to start this thread as I have been used multiple times now.... 

-Vps hoster Shane Hill, told me he would host my server free of charge, i go to login to the vps today and he changed the password and all and said &quot;Haha all your client/server is mine now&quot;

-Coder Matthew do believe his email is somewhere in this area xx_-bang-_xx@hotmail.com he coded my server did a crappy job because all he did was steal files off other servers and from his server he used to run. He also has deleted my site multiple times because i gave him access to it. He charges 5 dollars per webclient he makes and then hacks your paypal, or what ever you use. Dont teamview with him because he also puts a keylogger into your computer to get your passwords to everything....



-Fizzmo just a normal player that loves to start drama and leech

Go ahead and add to this list as i want to help everyone make sure to not pick certain people that will F**k you over, i have had it done multiple times and its not cool...

       Sincerely Yours,

              <p>sorry about that, but i really dont see it as a wall of shame… Just giving people the heads up to look out for these people as i want everyone to be successful, its a shame when people straight up flame the people and talk crap but im just simply describing what they did to me, not neccesarily flaming on them. Will remove it if needed though</p>
