    <description>Hey guys,
I just checked out the Battlescape base and it doesn&#39;t seem to have a functioning private messaging system. I was wondering if it is a cause of one of the edits I have made, or if it does not have working private messaging yet?

All help is appreciated.

Thank you.</description>
