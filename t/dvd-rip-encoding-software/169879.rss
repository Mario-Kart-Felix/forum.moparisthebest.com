    <title>DVD Rip/Encoding Software</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dvd-rip-encoding-software/169879</link>
    <description>Before you offer me your favs, read this through please.

I&#39;m using DVDShrink to rip a dvd to a single .vob file.  Reasonable enough.  Then I need to convert that to something AVISynth can read, possibly a low compression .avi file.  Any good encoding software for this?  Or is there something that can do it in one step?  I need it in the .avi file so I can encode it to x264, the holy grail of video encoders.  I&#39;ll play around with it some more, but if you guys have any tips, they are welcome.

Ok, this is what I&#39;m doing atm.

1.  DVDShrink to rip the main film from the dvd (stripping all the extras) to a single .vob file.  Tested.
2.  DVD2AVI to convert the .vob file to .avi file.  In Progress.
3.  Something to split the .avi file to a .avi video-only file and a .wav audio file.
4.  MeGUI to convert the .avi to a .264 file, then the .wav to a .m4a file.
5.  MeGUI muxer to interweave the .264 file and the .m4a file to a single .mp4 file.</description>
