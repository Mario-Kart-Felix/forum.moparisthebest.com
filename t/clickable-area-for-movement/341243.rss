    <title>&quot;Clickable&quot; Area for movement</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clickable-area-for-movement/341243</link>
    <description>Currently I am trying to edit S W A T&#39;s full screen client (317 nonrenamed) as a base client for the game I am making using runescape&#39;s world.
Onto my issue, I have gotten the client to fully minimize chat tab and the inventory...screen so to speak but the buttons are still there of course. I can make them unminimize, but while they are minimized I have to issues. One is button correlation, the scroll down for the chatbox is still in relationship to where it would be on a normal client, a bug I have not worked out yet.
In addition a player can not Click to move in the area that the inventory tab would be. Does anyone know where the data for click to move according to mouse location is at in a client?

tl;dr How do I edit the area on the screen in which you can click to move. A point in the right direction, not a how to guide if you please.</description>
