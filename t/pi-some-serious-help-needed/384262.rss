    <description>Hello,
I need some help making a custom minigame.

In this minigame I want that my players kill &quot;dragons&quot; and so archieve them a cape. (...)

But I wanna know how I make them spawn after the other died and put a timer on it. (Actually the principe of a timer in public void process).

It&#39;s like fight pits but I don&#39;t understand shit about it.

So basically could someone help me with it or explain a little to me?

Help is much appricated :)


And do NOT show me a minigame that already has this. I wanna do this minigame cuz I wanna learn about it. Not leech.</description>

              <p>Somewhat like zombie minigames but than with dragons?<br>
You have your fight pits class located src&gt;server&gt;model&gt;minigames<br>
You can base your whole minigame of that.<br>
Just copy the class and add the dragons id’s in final int waves.<br>
Rename to whatever your minigame should be called.<br>
I think you have an idea somewhat now. If it’s still not clear you can always pm me.</p>
