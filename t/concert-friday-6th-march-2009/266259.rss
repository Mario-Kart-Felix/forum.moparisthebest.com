    <description>Last night (Friday 6th March 2009) i went to a concert. I saw Emarosa, The Spill Canvas and You Me At Six. Just thought i&#39;d show you some vids which i have found from youtube :) Also i would like to say, i got the drummer of Emarosa&#39;s drum stick (snapped) and i touched the guitarists or drummers hand... he told me to let go :L

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssggbxY1OYI - You Me At Six - Jealous Minds Think Alike and Gossip Live in Bristol
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ptRUF8akKM - You Me At Six - Save it for the bedroom
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0C1_MwCUu4 - Ending song

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMIFG1Dfm44 - The first song is take off your colours and then is the truth is a terrible thing... at the end the song is meant to continue but they stoped and played fall out boy&#39;s sugar we&#39;re going down... WICKED XD</description>
