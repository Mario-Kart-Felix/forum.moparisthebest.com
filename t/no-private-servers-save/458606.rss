    <description>might not be a very smart question but i recently bought a new pc and transferred my 317s to it from my old computer. after putting them on, they all work fine except from my characters dont save. it is not in the source as it has worked fine on various other computers. how can i make saving work?! everytime i log in, it says character file not found and there are no saves in the character save folder. thanks.</description>
