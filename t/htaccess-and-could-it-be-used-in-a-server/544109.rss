    <title>.htaccess and could it be used in a server?</title>

    <description>Goal: block all vpn, proxy and tor traffic from accessing server/site

Could someone explain this snippet of code that I found which supposedly does the trick? And not a summary of what it does. I&#39;d like to know what individual characters and directives mean.

[code]
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP:VIA}                 !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:FORWARDED}           !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:USERAGENT_VIA}       !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:X_FORWARDED_FOR}     !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:PROXY_CONNECTION}    !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:XPROXY_CONNECTION}   !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:HTTP_PC_REMOTE_ADDR} !^$ [OR]
RewriteCond %{HTTP:HTTP_CLIENT_IP}      !^$
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [F]
[/code]

Is the equivalent of this possible to implement in a rsps? I&#39;m likely not interesting in using other sites&#39; api&#39;s or anything that I have to purchase. If you know anything about this please comment below.

Thanks.</description>

<p>There are a number of ways to determine a browsers details, user-agent is one of them. Do some Googling. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>There are third party applications and services that have built known proxy and VPN host lists, if you can utilize them properly they can be a helpful tool for automatically blacklisting the hosts from connecting to your website/game.</p>
<p>I have used Black Box in the past for detecting proxies.</p>
<p>However, you should probably tell the user that we don’t allow connections through a proxy or other mask so they know why they cannot connect to you instead of just blacklisting them with no warning.</p>
<p>Also, why do you need this? It seems a little odd to need such a feature.</p>
