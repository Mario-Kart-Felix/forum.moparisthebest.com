<p>And in like 2007: Hit 449 to be my GF!!! then the kids are like “448” then like right after: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>

<p>Another thing that annoys me is the kids that are like “OMFG I TREDED V LONG ON MAH MAIN FOR 324 PHAT SETS?!&gt;!?” they just make up ridiculous things that annoy me.</p>

              <p>I have just a mainly trained level 96 account, 84 strength and 76 attack, a level 97 with 99 HP and ranged wanted to DM me, I said no he started to attack, then we both agreed to a DM, and he ended up teleporting, that is really annoying, it happens <span class="bbcode-b">a lot</span>.</p>
<p>Also the other day on my level 49 melee pure, I was followed by a level 43 that showed me 200K (not exactly, but something like that), he had no equipment and he wanted to DM me at level 40 wild, when he got to low HP probably around 10-20, he said “hahaha noooob have fun walkin back i took teles!! lol!!!”, and then he started telling me to stop attacking (“plzzz stop i giv u haf of it” to be exact), not an everyday thing but it does happen sometimes.</p>
<p>Rangers at the Bounty Hunter worlds asking to 1v1 in level 30 wild so no teleporting, and ends up being a 4 man team that you own, and they start spamming PMs/clan chat/before they die, or any other way to get a message to you “reported hacker!!!” or “noob u suck!!l!!!”</p>
<p>Fishing at the Fishing Guild, level three botters fishing sharks, you say something towards them like “Lol, bot?” they say “stfu noob get a life” you just say “Lol”, they just go crazy, it’s kind of funny but it really is annoying “omfg stfu u maggot u suck”, “stfu noob im higher fisher then u”, “lol!!! lol!!! u suck!!! owned!!!”, “roflcopterz rofl rofl u suck noob get alife owned!!!” (then logs out).</p>
<p>Choppin’ magic logs at Camelot behind the Rangers Guild, people trying to act cool and everything, “sup i got 10 logs in 2 seconds wot u got? like 1?”, “roflz im pro i just pked 300m in items!”, “dude id so pwn u in cod or gtfo my tree nub” (what the fuck does CoD have to do with RuneScape?), other random stuff like that, even the wannabe mods, “go away this my tree!”, “noob reported 4 bug abuse an item scamming”, or when there is a Jagex Moderator around (true story) I seen this at Varrock, Mod MMG(?) was walking past this guy come up and said “Lol ignore those kiddies they just want mod, wuu2? - sec got like 50 ppl pming me”, “can u gimmeh some st00f il give 2 new ppl for u, just gave away my last 50mil”</p>
<p>Level 3’s that obviously have a main saying “rofl noob id own u, fite?”, when you get to wild they say “kk brb gettin on lvl 140 main”, I just sat there after 5 minutes he logged back on, that happens to me like every day and it is annoying.</p>

<p>Also, when you are fishing or something, and some guy in full mithril with a tyras helm and a mithril axe comes up to you, follows you, and says “can i hav ur fish pls”, you then follow up by saying “No.” and they follow up by saying “noob” and they walk away. This happened once to me. I go “Fool.” he goes “ur a mean ****” I go “Ass monkey.” then he picks up my fish I was dropping and I say to him, “Why are you in a members world anyways? I pay to get away from big dumb idiots like you. What the hell do you do anyways? You’re level 58 wearing full mithril with a tyras helm and you’re probably thinking you look pretty cool in it. Stop wasting your money and my time.”</p>
