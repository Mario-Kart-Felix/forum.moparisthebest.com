              <p>ok well do you know how to take and edit screen shots? if so then take a screen shot and edit it or do whatever you want to it. then go to <a href="http://www.allyoucanupload.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.allyoucanupload.com</a> and then just do what it tells you to, and it will give you a URL and you just put it in a post here or anywhere. if you dont know how to take screen shots or need more help just say so here. you can also put the URL that it gives you in between <img alt> and it will show the image right in the post, or if you just post the url then of course they will have to click on it to see your pic.</p>
