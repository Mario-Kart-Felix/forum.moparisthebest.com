    <title>I purchased VPS, But I don&#39;t know what to do!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-purchased-vps-but-i-dont-know-what-to-do/287752</link>
    <description>So I went to VPS land and purchased a Value pack for 30$. People have recommended it to me. I&#39;ve never used VPS, so I tried posting the IP on the server status, and it says its offline, but I thought vps never went offline?

What do I do please help?</description>
