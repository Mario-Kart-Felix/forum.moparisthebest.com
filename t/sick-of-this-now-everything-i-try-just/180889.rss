Right, ive been at this nearly a week, so far ive made a newb server which i was happy with just for starter. But making one isnt the problem its getting on other people&#39;s servers. Ive been trying out silabsoft client but it just says error connecting to server. me and my brother were on the other server i made yesterday but using himanchi which ive seen is not recomended, also when ive downloaded other servers thats when they dont work, i do this:
1.download and extract with winrar
2.open and compile (says complete)
3.click run/runserver 
4.wait, then it says its online and nothing comes up. 

Also what is the ip for silbasoft clients? is it the same as normal mopar server?

ive also got no-ip ive got 3 things:
-Jammy780.no-ip.biz
-Jammy780.no-ip.info
-Jammy780.no-ip.org

and yet none work. i think im doing it wrong because im using moparscape as my source not someone elses and then editing it so it doesnt have client.java file to edit. 

Please somebody tell me what im doing wrong.

Thanks
