    <title>Advertising Question (Not for RSPS)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/advertising-question-not-for-rsps/415599</link>
    <description>Well I have an online game and would like to know any good sites for advertising games. Any ideas. Please don&#39;t ask for the game or download link because that would be considered advertising on Moparscape and I don&#39;t wanna get banned.</description>

              <p>No, it doesn’t slow down the computer a lot :L</p>
<p>But either way, you can download utilities to password protect certain folders (and if I was in your shoes I would have done that the instant I realized my bro was doing something)</p>
<p>A good example is ‘<a href="http://fspro.net/my-lockbox/" data-bbcode="true">MyLockbox</a>’, you could try that one. Or talk to your parents and explain the situation, and see if you can have an account JUST for hosting the server without everyone getting one (thought like I said, it doesn’t slow down the computer a lot, at least with your 4gb RAM it shouldnt be an issue)</p>

<p>That slows the computer down a lot. If I create an account, my sister will create an account, my brother will create an account, my mom will create an account, and my dad will make an account. It’s the family computer that everybody uses, which is why I have to use ServerTool by Pizza, it hides the Java process while automatically restarting X amount of minutes.</p>

<p>Thank you. I used to have this big team of advertisers on my server that would advertise somewhere. They wouldn’t tell me where, and there was about 10 - 12 of them.

<p>My 11 year old brother logged in for the first time. The next day, instead of logging into my 95 players, I logged into 74… Next day it was 70, and dropping. He sells items that are worth 1300+ pk points for rsgp. 1m/cmaul (215pkp) or 10m/1337 phat (1337 pkp)<br>
He abuses like fuck, I can’t stop him. I host it at home - when I say I haven’t spent a penny, I really mean it. ;D<br>
$500 in my paypal<br>
[/quote]Errrr. How can you not stop him? How is he getting the stuff? If he’s admin, de-admin him. If he has access to the server or whatever, host it on an account he doesn’t have access to… Sounds like that’s either bogus, it’s actually you pretending to be your brother to get RSGP (I don’t know you so I’m not going to judge though), or you’re not very smart XD[/quote]</p>
<p>It’s hosted on a shared computer with 4GB of RAM. (Can’t buy another 4GB stick because it’s like $50 and takes weeks to ship) - I can’t host it on any other computer. My laptop is a pile of shit, my second desktop has 512mb of ram, my first desktop is being used to host something already, plus it only has 2gb and it lags like a bitch. Laptops also overheat so there’s no way I can host a rsps on a laptop.</p>
