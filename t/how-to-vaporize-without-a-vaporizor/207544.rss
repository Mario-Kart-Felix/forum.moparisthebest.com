    <title>How to vaporize without a vaporizor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-vaporize-without-a-vaporizor/207544</link>
    <description>Disclaimer: I do not condone any illegal use of cannabis, this guide is for medical patients and people in Amsterdam. ;D  Tobacco is a retarded, dangerous and addictive drug, don&#39;t do it. :eek:

This is going to be a guide on how to heat a substance and release it&#39;s active ingredient or flavor without buying a device that costs several hundred dollars or inhaling smoke.  The tools you will need are..
1. cigarette lighter
2. pipe/water pipe
3. tobacco/legally purchased medical marijuana from local dispensary.  :|

Chop up your medicine as fine as you please and put a bit(you wont need much) in the bowl.  Put the pipe to your mouth and inhale at a constant rate not too fast.  Bring the flame about 1-2cm to the medicine or tobacco until you see it slightly moving and changing a lighter color. Avoid bringing the lighter too close or the material will be burned and smoke will be created.

There are different techniques to get the perfect vape like tilting the bowl or &#39;aiming&#39; the lighter on a certain spot.

Using this method to medicate is safer then burning and producing smoke and is more efficient.  In smoke from a normal &#39;hit&#39; there can be as little as 3% THC(the active ingredient in medical cannabis.) but if manage to heat the plant material at around 392 degrees F the THC concentration can be over 80%!

Instead of smoke their is a vapor that tastes great and doesn&#39;t smell up a house, best exhaled through the nose for the full flavor.
Getting it right can be a bit tricky but if you have used a electronic vaporizer you can taste when it&#39;s at the right temperature.

If the material starts to turn dark or &#39;cherry&#39;, place your thumb over the bowl and inhale your hit.  I have personally stopped a sinus headache instantly with only 2 hits using this method!

This doesn&#39;t just make a hit more powerful, it makes what would have been 1, 10%THC hit  up to 20 much higher %THC hits.  This is why vaporizers sell for as much as $600!

Vape up!

EDIT: Forgot to include that there us a RISK of burning your hair if you don&#39;t watch what yyour doing.. I&#39;ve seen it happen to at least 3 people! :eek:</description>

<p>Yeah it’s not really “thc build up,” but it’s basically a bunch of crystals and trichomes from the weed.  It’s essentially the same thing as hash, just not compressed.</p>

<p>Basically its a bong? Lol.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, because when you smoke with a bong you are just inhaling the smoke in larger amounts than if you were smoking a regular joint. A vaporizer, on the other hand, heats up the marijuana to the exact temperature of the active ingredient (THC) and does not burn the weed so you inhale a thin vapour, instead of smoke, which is a stronger hit because it has a higher % of THC.</p>
<p>EDIT: The above may be slightly inaccurate but it’s just my understanding.</p>

              <p>[quote=“ThAt0n36Uy, post:6, topic:207544”]I use a new bulb everytime. And mine I just take apart, and it looks like random crap in my room. I keep the bulb in a light bulb box in my closet, the bottle top taped underneath my dresser, and it doesn’t look like anything is there. Usually I’ll replace the bulb after 3 or 4 times.[/quote] Hopefully you clean it out with something good or look forward to brain cancer(apparently)</p>
<p>EDIT: I have tried light bulb vaporizers(only cleaned out with salt :|) they do work good and if you haven’t tried one or another type of vaporizer it can be harder to do what I posted in the tut.</p>
<p>I think the cons outweigh the pros with a light bulb vaporizer though…<br>
You have to break the top part off and the glass can shatter in your hand.  You have to risk inhaling any of the white stuff left over and extremely small pieces of metal that come off the metal wire if the light bulb has been used.  You have to use allot of lighter fluid an let it sit and heat up and theres not much way to tell when it’s at the right temperature and if it goes over theres no way to cool it down.</p>
<p>If it were to get found the person that found it would assume your a meth addicted.(I read a story about someones parents finding theres on another forum.)  If you want to take it anywhere you have to keep  it in your pocket and if it breaks or you trip or something you might be going to the hospital!  :eek:<br>
The glass can also break while being used witch can result in inhaling glass! and lose whatever was in it.</p>
<p>Toomuch danger for me!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:"></p>

              <p>I use a new bulb everytime. And mine I just take apart, and it looks like random crap in my room. I keep the bulb in a light bulb box in my closet, the bottle top taped underneath my dresser, and it doesn’t look like anything is there. Usually I’ll replace the bulb after 3 or 4 times.</p>

I find it takes too long to heat the glass up too, I can hit the pipe like I normally would and grab a vape hit, works on almost all ‘smoking’ devices.</p>
<p>Vaping with a pipe takes skill <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=6" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>

              <p>Disclaimer: I do not condone any illegal use of cannabis, this guide is for medical patients and people in Amsterdam. ;D  Tobacco is a retarded, dangerous and addictive drug, don’t do it. :eek:</p>
<p>This is going to be a guide on how to heat a substance and release it’s active ingredient or flavor without buying a device that costs several hundred dollars or inhaling smoke.  The tools you will need are…</p>
<ol>
<li>cigarette lighter</li>
<li>pipe/water pipe</li>
<li>tobacco/legally purchased medical marijuana from local dispensary.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=6" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:">
</li>
</ol>
<p>Chop up your medicine as fine as you please and put a bit(you wont need much) in the bowl.  Put the pipe to your mouth and inhale at a constant rate not too fast.  Bring the flame about 1-2cm to the medicine or tobacco until you see it slightly moving and changing a lighter color. Avoid bringing the lighter too close or the material will be burned and smoke will be created.</p>
<p>There are different techniques to get the perfect vape like tilting the bowl or ‘aiming’ the lighter on a certain spot.</p>
<p>Using this method to medicate is safer then burning and producing smoke and is more efficient.  In smoke from a normal ‘hit’ there can be as little as 3% THC(the active ingredient in medical cannabis.) but if manage to heat the plant material at around 392 degrees F the THC concentration can be over 80%!</p>
<p>Instead of smoke their is a vapor that tastes great and doesn’t smell up a house, best exhaled through the nose for the full flavor.<br>
Getting it right can be a bit tricky but if you have used a electronic vaporizer you can taste when it’s at the right temperature.</p>
<p>If the material starts to turn dark or ‘cherry’, place your thumb over the bowl and inhale your hit.  I have personally stopped a sinus headache instantly with only 2 hits using this method!</p>
<p>This doesn’t just make a hit more powerful, it makes what would have been 1, 10%THC hit  up to 20 much higher %THC hits.  This is why vaporizers sell for as much as $600!</p>
<p>Vape up!</p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot to include that there us a RISK of burning your hair if you don’t watch what yyour doing… I’ve seen it happen to at least 3 people! :eek:</p>
