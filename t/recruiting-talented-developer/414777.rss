    <description>Hello all,

I am currently recruiting a talented programmer to join my team working on a new RSC server. We are NOT using the RSCD source. The goal of this project is to develop an architecture that can scale to thousands of players and keeping the server 100% identical to the original RSC. We absolutely have a plan developed to do this.

A little about myself. I was in the RSC scene years ago making small bots. I am now a professional programmer and am doing this work on the side. I also am going to school to complete a Computer Science degree. All of the people that are on this development team are paid to program in one way or another, and we are doing this as a fun side-project to test our skills. We all bring something different to the table, and thats what I will be looking for from the person that joins our team.

I am purposefully not leaving a lot of information here, and if you are interested in creating the future of RSC servers, please send me a PM and I will get back to you ASAP.

Thanks,
Kyle</description>

You’re right, I made a mistake in communicating what I meant.<br>
What I really meant was that timing out for 1000 or 500ms is just plain… /unnecessary/. You take away time from checking for I/O events. In that time you could have events queue up, while with a more immediate, asynchronous model like mine you dispatch events right as they come in.<br>
If you need to make changes in like event interests or what not, you can wake the selector up.<br>
In a system with many players, constant timeouts could be inefficient.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Did you not ready why they timeout? They do it so they can go and process idle sessions. When you lose a cycle tops to do this, I wouldn’t call it /unnecessary/ Our systems require that data be sent out every 600ms. Stopping the selector for very little time will not make a difference[/quote]<br>
Sent out indeed, but what about incoming data? You can expect a packet from every client at least once a second.<br>
Processing idle sessions can be implemented in another way; you can schedule a time-out task in the future for something like ~100 ticks which would mean a full minute of inactivity. When a read occurs, you merely invalidate and reschedule the task. This way your networking I/O only needs to be interrupted by requests to modify selector state.</p>

If you want to hold thousands of players then you should look into creating your own framework as already stated. The idea behind my project is not for a replica so I don’t see why we would need to collaborate. My side project is too replicate rsc pking with the lowest latency.

<p>Actually, I’d bet /my/ system has lower latency. I think I may described it before, but in the case I haven’t… generally, I use NIO and invoke Selector.select() without timeout in a dedicated thread… this ensures I can handle events immediately, while frameworks like MINA and Netty prefer to not use such a blocking thread and instead check every 500ms.

<p>Where’s your proof? Latency is entirely up to the connection speeds of the people playing.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Lol. What about the time the server spends processing the packets and sending a response? Since each client has their own thread all the processing happens concurrently. The event based model and zoning system used in RSCDEF also allows for faster processing than other servers.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They aren’t all handled concurrently though. The max in the best possible situation is the number of logical processors you have. Up to 8 on a dedicated server, and 2-4 on a desktop. All of the threads get dealt with in a round robin type system where they all share a slice of time to do their work</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yes, I’m aware. That is what concurrency is. So instead of processing each client one at a time, your processors are actively switching between multiple client threads, which is most definitely faster because you do not have to wait for an entire server loop to process the client again. The main issue with RSCDEF is it does not scale well because it is trying to process too many threads at the same time. That is where design changes come in <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I can’t really see how you’ll be able to scale multiple threads if they’re not all treated in the same importance… Given that it is “faster” threading out each client, there are situations that arise that don’t absolutely warrant it (say the Player is only chatting/idling not requiring constant updates vs another Player who is fighting/eating/casting). Thus you would be losing precious processing power on minimal work loads, rather than giving everyone equal processing time.[/quote]</p>
<p>You are correct. Like I have said, we are NOT using the exact implementation RSCDEF provides. This is a very common problem that has plenty of solutions. One is pretty obvious and has been used in other servers.</p>

<p>They aren’t all handled concurrently though. The max in the best possible situation is the number of logical processors you have. Up to 8 on a dedicated server, and 2-4 on a desktop.

</aside>
<p>Yes, I’m aware. That is what concurrency is. So instead of processing each client one at a time, your processors are actively switching between multiple client threads, which is most definitely faster because you do not have to wait for an entire server loop to process the client again. The main issue with RSCDEF is it does not scale well because it is trying to process too many threads at the same time. That is where design changes come in :)[/quote]</p>
<p>I can’t really see how you’ll be able to scale multiple threads if they’re not all treated in the same importance… Given that it is “faster” threading out each client, there are situations that arise that don’t absolutely warrant it (say the Player is only chatting/idling not requiring constant updates vs another Player who is fighting/eating/casting). Thus you would be losing precious processing power on minimal work loads, rather than giving everyone equal processing time.</p>

</aside>
<p>RSCDEF is already written. It is a very solid base and with some changes it could become great. We already have implemented some very cool technologies to increase the processing speeds of our server. I am not posting any of our plans on forums right now, as we are not developing this for the community. This project is only going to be used for the server we plan on running.</p>
<p>If anyone is interested, send me a PM and I will give you information to come talk to the team.</p>

              <p>We are using the RSCDEF source.</p>
<p>The other members involved P_0_T, Dorker1, CamHart, Cyan. Not all of them are working with the source, but they are directly involved with the server we will be putting up once completely developed. There is also one other person who is not involved in any RS communities, but is helping out with the coding.</p>
