    <title>Need help in making a client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-in-making-a-client/549468</link>
    <description>So, I know I will get hated  :palm: at but I was wondering what are the steps to making a client on moparclassic? I got everything from the server side all hooked up and connected. I downloaded the alternate moparclassic client folder and tried to create a jar but was unsuccessful. I was wondering if anyone could guide in the the right direction. I don&#39;t know if this has been posted before.</description>
