Okay, first make sure that you have the ring of life already ingame, unfortunately I do not have the models or ints so I can not provide them maybe somebody could get them for me;

Anyways the pieces of code we will be adding is this:


[code]public boolean RingofLife () {
if(playerEquipment[playerRing] == 2570 &amp;&amp; playerLevel[0] &lt; 11 &amp;&amp; inCombat == true) {
try {
toX = 5656;
toY = 6565;
sM(&quot;Your ring of life saves you from dying! Doing so it shattered!&quot;);
playerEquipment[playerRing] = -1;
playerEquipmentN[playerRing] = 0;
setEquipment(-1, 0,playerRing);
} catch (Exception e) {
if( playerLevel[0] == 0) {
return false;
} else
return true;
} 
return false;
}
return true;
}[/code]

Now lets describe what each piece does;

[code]if(playerEquipment[playerRing] == 2570) &amp;&amp; playerLevel[0] &lt; 11 [/code]
This piece asks if you&#39;re wearing a ring of life and your HP is under 11. 

[code]&amp;&amp; inCombat == true) {[/code]
This piece makes it so everytime you&#39;re under 11 HP you don&#39;t teleport.

[code]toX = ####;
toY = ####;[/code]
This tells where you will go after you activated your ring of life.

[code]sM(&quot;Your ring of life saves you from dying! Doing so it shattered!&quot;)[/code]
This piece will send your character message saying that your ring of life
[code]
playerEquipment[playerRing] = -1;
playerEquipmentN[playerRing] = 0;
setEquipment(-1, 0,playerRing);[/code]
This tells the server to remove your ring, basically make it dissapear.

[code]} catch (Exception e) { // this makes it possible for the next if statement to be reached
if( playerLevel[0] == 0) { /this makes it so if the players HP is &quot;0&quot; he doesn&#39;t teleport away.
return false; // this tells the server to make the ring of life method to not work.
} else // calls back the RoL method
return true; // tells the server to make the RoL method work
} 
return false; //scrap code i needed to add in for errors.
}
return true; // scrap code i needed to add in for errors.
}
