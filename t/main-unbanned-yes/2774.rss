    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/main-unbanned-yes/2774</link>
    <description>my main had gotten banned sometime last year. read this. im realy happy.

Dear .........

Thanks for the appeal,

Based on your history in RuneScape, and your apparently willingness to follow the rules, we have decided to give you a second chance. However this incident has been recorded on the account, you are being monitored, and any further rulebreaking will result in a permanent ban.

Your account has been banned for a period of one week, after which you will be able to play again. Do not send in further ban appeals, or messages about this.

We suggest that you take the time to make yourself familiar with our Rules of Conduct which can be found in the &#39;Information and Advice&#39; section of www.runescape.com

Yours Sincerely
Mod Simon C
RuneScape Customer Support

**********************************

On 13th May 2006, you sent us the following:

To whom this may concern.
Yes. I completely admit that i was wrong. I cheated and I&#39;m sorry. I will never cheat on runescape again. I have played this on this character for about 4 years and I regret what I have done. Please consider my plea for mercy. Give me another chance, even if you give me black marks.
Sincerely,(insert my name here)
