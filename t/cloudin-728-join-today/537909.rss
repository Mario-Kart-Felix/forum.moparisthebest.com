[b][center]About CloudIn728 

CloudIn728 Is a private server remake of CloudIn 704 back in 2011, Back in 2011 we had over 100 people playing, our secondary Owner/Developer Keiron(Me) quit back in 2011 due to being annoyed with the other Owner, now today Keiron is fully 100% Owner and is in charge of everything we have over 100 players playing again and more to come due to upcoming promotional video which is going to be made by IxKarim. 


What makes us better than other servers? 

Well first of all, we have two In-Game Developers (Keiron(Me), Spiritwo(Joey)) That are doing updates constantly every day and fixing all the bugs we can find, we have one Web Developer which is (Justin) That has done an amazing job on the Forums So we can do all our work on the Server without worrying about the forums at all. 

Why should I play CloudIn? 

CloudIn is a 718 loading 728 server, we are nothing like any other 728 loading server, we guarantee that you have never played a server like this. We also like to offer you a chance to use our new unique point system called CloudIn Points, to obtain points you have to kill npcs or players but you will be rewarded by the chance to use the new points to buy the best equipment on the server (PVP armour/Weapons). You can play now instantly and join the adventure with hundreds of others.

[color=green]To be honest with you guys, I only opened the server up for couple of friends in march because they we&#39;re tired of ignorant and owners that never do updates at all, but now I see that we&#39;ve reached over 100 players online at one given time and 70+ on at all times and we&#39;re coming a sucess so now I&#39;m going to post advertisement threads on the appropiate websites. 

I haven&#39;t posted much content due to having a short time to make this thread due to that I have to go get a new mouse cause my mouse just broke, but if you would like to visit our updates section you will see all the unique and awesome updates, thank you, Keiron. [/center]</description>
