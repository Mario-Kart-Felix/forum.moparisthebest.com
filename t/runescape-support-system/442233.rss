    <title>RuneScape Support System</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/runescape-support-system/442233</link>
    <description>We all know that RuneScape has one of the worst support systems in the world, but the question is, why? I&#39;ve seen many arguments - both understandable and some just plain ignorant - and it all just comes down to its system having more cons than pros. I&#39;m very aware that there are many factors you have to observe and take into consideration, but the differences are easily comparable to any other MMO out there.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pros:

[ul][li]Jagex does not have to worry about putting too much time into support issues.[/li]
	[li]This could somehow encourage people to mature a little and learn to take matters in their own hands - although this factor seems completely absurd considering that 1/3 the population is immature &quot;kids&quot;.[/li][/ul]
Cons:

[ul][li]Players pretty much have one opportunity when it comes down to situations like luring incidents, hacks, and even scams.[/li]
	[li]The only reference a person has to contacting someone at Jagex is a computer generated ticket system, which no one is still sure if they are manually or automatic responded to.[/li]
	[li]The lack of an improved system has lead to the community&#39;s immaturity spreading like a plague.[/li]
	[li]RuneScape has a higher player loss ratio compared to many MMOs.[/li][/ul]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Now, before the flame wagon comes along, please try to understand - that is if you are mature - that the aforementioned are pure opinions, and as far as I&#39;m concerned, include no factual information whatsoever. I do not wish this to turn into a debate, but a friendly discussion. That being said, please share your ideas of this topic.</description>

              <p>Yes, I do agree that their support system is so bad that it could be interpreted as if there was none at all, but just for the sake of me being depicted as a troll, I will just keep my opinion that it actually is just really bad.</p>

              <p>I was banned on one of my accounts under the “goldfarmer” offense. I actually never sold RS gold. Needless to say, I was the one actually collecting RSGP from players. There was no evidence that I sold gold. I’ve appealed, and after eight months nothing has updated.</p>
