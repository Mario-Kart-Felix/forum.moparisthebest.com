    <title>Advertising the Advertisement Board in the Server Downloads Board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/advertising-the-advertisement-board-in-the-server-downloads-board/445519</link>
    <description>If you look at the Server Downloads board, you&#39;d see there are a bunch of members and guests browsing it - the same sort of audience that once browsed the advertisement board back in the day (well, forums actually). I don&#39;t think enough people actually know it&#39;s back, so why not post about it in the board or have some sort of notification? I also think we should encourage server hosters to direct their players to the board and give their servers good criticism. It would bring a large amount of traffic to the forums, and the board would likely gain as much popularity as the SSP one day. Just a thought.

              <p>I kind of agree with this. We have to promote the board a little bit more, and since Server Downloads is the forums second-most popular board according to forum statistics, it’s a good target.</p>
