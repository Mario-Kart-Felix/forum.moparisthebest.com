    <title>A server to play?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-server-to-play/539704</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not interested in Runescape or a private server with less than 200 people. I know SoulSplit has thousands playing and BattleScape is back up (for like the 6th time), but does anyone have any suggestions for a good quality server? Looking for older graphics preferably but not a requirement. 

Also, if anyone wants to join me on playing an RSPS. I will be down. When I don&#39;t have homework or I&#39;m not working I&#39;m not sure what to do.</description>

              <p>This is pretty much just begging people to advertise out of the advertisement sections. Just check the SSP or that section.</p>
