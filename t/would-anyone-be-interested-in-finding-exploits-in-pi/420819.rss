    <title>Would anyone be interested in finding exploits in PI</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/would-anyone-be-interested-in-finding-exploits-in-pi/420819</link>
    <description>I was wondering if anyone would be interested, because it could be quite fun, I have talked to him he says he added over 50 exploits. Would anyone like to join in trying to find them?</description>
