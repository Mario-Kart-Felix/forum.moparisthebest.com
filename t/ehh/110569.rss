    <description>OK well, I got most of my server up, but I use a wireless router, and I don&#39;t understand how to port forward. I went onto the site, www.portforward.com, and I selected my router. I then proceeded to select the program I am forwarding my port. Well what program do I select to forward it. I  searched for MoparScape, and before anyone says anything, I HAVE got the compiler working, got my no-ip, and I can successfully log into my server. I just need to port forward to let others onto it. 

Thanks :)
Any help is appreciated
