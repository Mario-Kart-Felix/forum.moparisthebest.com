    <title>How to get free runes or gp on Runescape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-get-free-runes-or-gp-on-runescape/6032</link>
    <description>Well , i doubt many of you actually play it legit that often ( me as one of them )
So ive put together this little guide on how to get free runes or gp on runescape.

[size=10pt][u][b]Free pure ess :[/b][/u][/size]
Go to the North-West section of the rune essence mines on world 99
There will be people wearing the teal robes [img]http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/6712/openoa9.gif[/img]
, Once they say open , trade them and they will give you 28 pure ess.( This is where i am atm , playing it legit :P )

[size=10pt][u][b]Free Law Runes :[/b][/u][/size]
Go to Entrana and run up to the law altar on world 99, there will be people wearing the same teal robes.
You must bring 27 unoted Pure essence , and you dont get it back like on world 66
But its much much faster.

[size=10pt][u][b]Free cosmic runes :[/b][/u][/size]
You Must Bring 25 Unnoted Pure essence to the cosmic alter and go INSIDE of the alter. If you trade someone with [u][b]black[/b][/u] wizard robes, you will be given 7k cash and 25 noted pure ess. If you trade someone in [i][u]blue wizard robes[/u][/i], you will receive 35 cosmic Runes and 25 noted pure ess.


[size=10pt][u][b]Free Nature Runes :[/b][/u][/size]
Goto the Nat altar on world 22 , Im not sure if you have to go into the altar or wait outside.
Bring 25 pure ess with you ( just bring some gp and buy from the general store there :P )
Then trade whoever is there , cant remember what color they wear ( sorry ) and they will give u 50 nats for your 25 rune ess.


[size=10pt][u][b]Free air runes or 2.5k:[/b][/u][/size]
Goto the air altar on world 16 (non members world).
You need an air talisman or tiara &amp; 25 empty inventory spaces. Bring 25 unnoted ess your first trip. They supply ess after that.
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Go to the air altar in world 16 (a non-member world). Bring 25 unnoted rune essence (ess) to get paid the first trip. We will supply ess after that. The mysterious ruins for the air altar are south of Falador, west of the road, before the T. You need an air tally or tiara to get in.

2. Trade one of our crafters: one in BLACK robes to get paid in cash, or one in BLUE robes to get paid in airs.

(Skip to step 6 if you bring your own ess to start.)

3. Ask a crafter to give you 25 starter ess. (Not all crafters will.)

4. Take the noted ess to the East Falador bank, deposit and withdraw it to unnote it.

5. Bring 25 unnoted ess back to the air altar. DON&#39;T RUNECRAFT IT!

6. Trade the ess to one of our crafters.

7. You will be given 2500 gp or 125 airs, and another 25 noted ess.

8. Repeat steps 4 to 7 as many times as you want!&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Thats about it really ....
Im trying to start a free iron ore company at ardy but i have no miners atm  :&#39;( :&#39;(

Hope this helps you guys out</description>

<p>and @ salad , its better if you want the ess and cbf to mine it , theres normally about 10 miners there and only like 8 ppl getting ess from us , so once u goto bank can come bank u get ess again , and im 62 mining and it takes me 1 min to get a full bag … so i dunno what youre talking about 20 seconds[/quote]<br>
u can get 100gp a second at flax, and do it as many times as u want, eg. way quicker than travlin across the map for 2.5k…</p>

<p>free ess is lame, because u can get exp by mining it for only a few seconds longer.</p>
