I’d be surprised if that was the problem (though it is ofcourse a possibility). Probably used a cheat client (or cheat engine) to change packet data to give him the items he wanted. You can expect alot of these things to happen when using a PI-source.[/quote]<br>
I’ve used cheat engine since before it was cool <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> Really good for testing bugs in my server too lol. But for that just made a new client :D, can spam it with rapid packets, and see if anything fookey happens. i could bug test yours but im writing my own server from scratch ._. too much crap is in current ones, this is only way to get a clean one <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> (its like 3rd time i have started a server from scratch, but i got it logging in walking and doing commands so i am happy)</p>
