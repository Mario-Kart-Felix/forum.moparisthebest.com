[ul]Problem with Compiler(s), &quot;Javac not recongized?&quot;, well here&#39;s your solution, your going to need Java and Jdk.

Jdk can be found by clicking -

This step-by-step tutorial describing how you can manage the environment variables in Windows XP/7. Environment variables are strings that contain information about the environment for the system, and the currently logged on user. Some software programs use the information to determine where to place files (such as temporary files). During installation, Windows XP/7 Setup configures the default system variables, such as the path to the Windows files. 


[size=12pt][b][u]Managing Enviromental Variables (System Variable)[/u][/b][/size]

You must be an administrator to modify a system environment variable. System environment variables are defined by Windows and apply to all computer users. Changes to the system environment are written to the registry, and usually require a restart to become effective.

[size=12pt][u][b]User Variables for User Name[/b][/u][/size]

Any user can add, modify, or remove a user environment variable. These variables are established by Windows XP/7 Setup, by some programs, and by users. The changes are written to the registry, and are usually effective immediately. However, after a change to user environment variables is made, any open software programs should be restarted to force them to read the new registry values. The common reason to add variables is to provide data that is required for variables that you want to use in scripts.

To view or change environment variables: 
Right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.

Click the Advanced tab.
Click Environment variables.
Click one the following options, for either a user or a system variable:
Click New to add a new variable name and value.
Click an existing variable, and then click Edit to change its name or value.
Click an existing variable, and then click Delete to remove it.

[size=12pt][u][b]Adding them[/b][/u][/size]

Firstly your going to need to find your CLASSPATH.
You can do this by going to;
C: Program Files or Program Files (x86), Java, Your Jdk.

Then click User Varibles, 

User Varible name: CLASSPATH
Varible Value: (Your user directory) C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_22\bin

Now for System Varibles just leave your Path there already and add ; if your useing Wind7.
Most of the time you won&#39;t need to add anything in System Varibles.

[size=12pt][b][u]Running and Compiling[/u][/b][/size]

Many people have problems with Running and Compiling as they don&#39;t understand how it works.

Since people are useing Project Insanity mostly these days i&#39;ll example useing the run.bat from it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;@echo off
title Project Insanity
java -Xmx800m -cp bin;deps/poi.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar;deps/jython.jar;log4j-1.2.15.jar; server.Server
pause&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
This is showing what Files/Folders are used to be ran for it to work, inless the Client isn&#39;t compatiable with the Xmx leave everything.

&lt;blockquote&gt;@echo off
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin\javac.exe&quot; -classpath deps/log4j-1.2.15.jar;deps/jython.jar;deps/xstream.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/poi.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar -d bin src\server\event\*.java src\server\model\items\*.java src\server\model\minigames\*.java src\server\model\npcs\*.java src\server\model\objects\*.java src\server\model\players\*.java src\server\model\players\skills\*.java src\server\model\players\packets\*.java src\server\model\shops\*.java src\server\net\*.java src\server\task\*.java src\server\util\*.java src\server\world\*.java src\server\util\log\*.java src\server\*.java src\server\world\map\*.java
pause&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Leave everything, and just look, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin\javac.exe after this directory is what&#39;s being or going to be compiled, you&#39;ll leave that.

C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_18\bin\javac.exe,
This is your directory so it picks up what Jdk your useing, so simply change the 18 to your Jdk, mines 22. So it would be C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_22\bin\javac.exe.
If your useing Windows 7, wherever your Jdk is placed change the directory, like I said, normaly for Windows 7 it&#39;s, C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk.1.6.0_22\bin\javac.exe. 

-Your done, was that hard?.

I hope it helped you.

Pictures coming soon for nooblets that can&#39;t read.
