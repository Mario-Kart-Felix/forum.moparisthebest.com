 [b]Introduction[/b]
Welcome to ScapR, where anything can happen. If you think you&#39;ve got what it takes to be a ScapR, you&#39;re obv iously in the right place.

[b]About us[/b]
ScapR main objective is to provide a fun environment for the players and to give them lots of things to do. Everything on the server should be simple to do, and easy to figure out. We have multiple quests to start and we will be adding many more very soon!

[b]Why ScapR?[/b]
So, why should you choose to be a member of ScapR? We have a lot of potential, although were new we will do anything to make the server succeed.

[b]Moderators?[/b]
We are looking for active members to be moderators! What will we be looking for in a moderator? You should be ACTIVE on both the forums and the server. It is advised that you learn how the server works so that if somebody may need help, you&#39;ll be able to provide that help. If we ever need additional Admins, our moderators will be the first to be promoted. No exceptions.

[b]Credits[/b]
