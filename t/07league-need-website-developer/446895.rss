[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,549780.0.html]Development Thread (more pictures)[/url]

This project was created with a goal to simply become a legitimate remake and show everyone that 2006scape is a piece of shit, and never should be delayed by over 6 months. All of my progress has been done in under a month. (first backup was made June 3rd)

Now I need an experienced website programmer to create a &quot;Create account&quot; thing and also the forums. You will be paid depending on how many donations we receive (probably a lot)

Requirements to join:
Website Developer - You must know how to create a fully functional login feature, with account storing, and ALSO build the forums.

To apply, use this layout:

In-Game Name/Server Forums Name?:
How old are you?:
E-mail address?:
What position do you want? (Website Developer ):
How long have you coded?:
What time zone are you in?:
How long will you be on everyday?:
Why do you want to become part of this server?:
Any Suggestions?:</description>

<p>Project - A whole team of people on a project trying to make it popular and functionally excellent. This includes the staff team, any financial backers, developers, advertisers, etc. We do not have a board for this at the moment, which we understand could make it confusing.</p>
<p>Development team - A team of developers that program and code a server. This includes only developers. To be honest you should be glad that we allow web development applications in this section, as the section is really about server development.[/quote]<br>
I’ve removed the ‘advertiser’ part of your post, as that doesn’t fit into a ‘development team’.</p>

<p>This project was created with a goal to simply become a legitimate remake and show everyone that 2006scape is a piece of shit, and never should be delayed by over 6 months. All of my progress has been done in under a month. (first backup was made June 3rd)</p>
<p>Now I need an experienced website programmer to create a “Create account” thing and also the forums. You will be paid depending on how many donations we receive (probably a lot)</p>
<p>Requirements to join:<br>
Website Developer - You must know how to create a fully functional login feature, with account storing, and ALSO build the forums.</p>
<p>To apply, use this layout:</p>
<p>In-Game Name/Server Forums Name?:<br>
How old are you?:<br>
E-mail address?:<br>
What position do you want? (Website Developer ):<br>
How long have you coded?:<br>
What time zone are you in?:<br>
How long will you be on everyday?:<br>
Why do you want to become part of this server?:<br>
Any Suggestions?:</p>
