    <title>[PI] Conneting client to source problem!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-conneting-client-to-source-problem/447077</link>
    <description>Yeah, I tried to update my client to other PI, (with  custom emotes and shit) cause I couldn&#39;t add custom emotes to the old one. (dunno ytho, gave errors)

So, i changed the java files, and when I try to run it says &quot;*server* has been updated! Please reload this page!&quot;
I also changed the uids.</description>
