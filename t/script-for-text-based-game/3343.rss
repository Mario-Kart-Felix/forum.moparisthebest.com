    <title>Script for Text-Based Game</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/script-for-text-based-game/3343</link>
    <description>Hi,
I have been playing a web-based strategy game called OGame for a while. You can play it at www.ogame.org. The really annoying thing is that things take a long time to build. Do you think that I will be able to make a scar script that finds a text in the wepage then clicks on it, then finds another text to vertify that it worked, then it logs out, logs back in, and so on... Or basiclly:
Does scar have a command for finding a text on a webage. For example could I give it a command to find the word &quot;build&quot; on a certain webpage?
If the answer is yes then I think that everything else is straight foreward...

Thanks for you help,
-Quilby</description>

              <p>It searches an area of your choice. The first 4 variables are the co-ordinates 0,0 the top left and 800,600 the bottom right. You can change those to whatever area you’re searching for. The x,y variables return a co-ordinates which is the very top left of where the text was found. Say you were looking for “Here i am”, the co-ordinate would be right at the top left of the “H”. “TickerFont” is the font you declared before. The other variables you shouldn’t touch because they will just mess it up.</p>
<p>When you’re Declaring your text the variables are (Font name, font size, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>What you have to do is something like the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Force your web browser to display a nice and simple font (it’s in settings somewhere). I chose Courier New for this.</li>
<li>Load the font size and so on… The method is in the scar help file.<br>
TickerFont := loadCharsFromFont2(‘Courier New’, 10, True, False, False, False);</li>
<li>Use this to find your text<br>
if(IsTextInAreaEx(0, 0, 800, 600, x, y, ‘Looking for this text here’, 0, TickerFont, False, True, 0, 0, -1))then</li>
</ol>
<p>I used this to create a neopets script that reads in and records stock information and the buys the best stock available.  Good luck with it.</p>
