              <p>[quote=“dragonus18, post:17, topic:167284”]adam and eve vs evolution<br>
god created earth in 7 days vs scientific explanation[/quote]</p>
<p>Theistic evolution.</p>
<p>[quote=“Buzzy, post:18, topic:167284”]I’ll give the two that I found when I was 11 years old and I started studying the bible.</p>
<p>Read genesis, it says that there were four people on earth when cain killed abel, correct? Well, how is it possible that cain killed abel and then left to marry a woman from another place, doesn’t make sense. I’ve heard that the counter argument to this is that in these times, daughters were not mentioned. I don’t buy that, when there’s 5 people on the entire planet, you better believe we’d account for everyone of them, not that we actually have any proof of “Adam and Eve”.</p>
<p>The second, and the one I found earlier on, in sunday school, is a weak hole, but a hole still the same. I can’t remember what book, but it says that jesus traveled to jerusalem with his parents when he was 12 years old, and they were walking through the city, when jesus left his parents, and went to a temple to preach to the religious people, I’m sure you heard this is where he magically picked out the scrolls of the torra as if he knew exactly where they were and preached the word. Well, what isn’t brought to your attention is that jesus left his parents when he was supposed to stay (yeah, ok maybe it didn’t say that his parents said to say directly in the bible, but what parent wouldn’t). That is one of the ten commandments, and your savior broke it.[/quote]</p>
<p>Adam and Eve could have had unmentioned daughters.  Because women belong in the kitchen and bedroom, not the Bible.</p>
<p>First of all, he is the Son of God.  So of course he would know the law and the Torah, that’s the entire point.  Also, by schooling the teachers of the law, is that not honoring his parents?  I agree, it’s a weak hole.</p>

<p>I’ll give the two that I found when I was 11 years old and I started studying the bible.</p>
<p>Read genesis, it says that there were four people on earth when cain killed abel, correct? Well, how is it possible that cain killed abel and then left to marry a woman from another place, doesn’t make sense. I’ve heard that the counter argument to this is that in these times, daughters were not mentioned. I don’t buy that, when there’s 5 people on the entire planet, you better believe we’d account for everyone of them, not that we actually have any proof of “Adam and Eve”.</p>
<p>The second, and the one I found earlier on, in sunday school, is a weak hole, but a hole still the same. I can’t remember what book, but it says that jesus traveled to jerusalem with his parents when he was 12 years old, and they were walking through the city, when jesus left his parents, and went to a temple to preach to the religious people, I’m sure you heard this is where he magically picked out the scrolls of the torra as if he knew exactly where they were and preached the word. Well, what isn’t brought to your attention is that jesus left his parents when he was supposed to stay (yeah, ok maybe it didn’t say that his parents said to say directly in the bible, but what parent wouldn’t). That is one of the ten commandments, and your savior broke it.</p>
