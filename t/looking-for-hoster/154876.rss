    <title>Looking for hoster</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-hoster/154876</link>
    <description>I&#39;m searching for a hoster for my server. Needs to be online fairly often. Also need to be able to receive continuous updates for the server as I hope to be updating a lot. If you pretend to want to host my server to steal it, don&#39;t bother. Also, hoster get co-ownership.

Many Thanks,
