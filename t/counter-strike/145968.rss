    <description>Hi guys.

Computer Specifications:

Celeron CPU 2.40 GHz
512Mb Ram
OnBoard Intel 845G Graphics

The Story....

I play counter-strike 1.5. Not as fps consuming as 1.6 and source. The problem is, i only get around 10 - 40 fps when im playing... but when im in console from main menu it says i get just below 60 fps. When im playing and i move around, i have hellishly looking graphics and i move sooo slow. I can barely get any frags because most of the time i get killed first... and the bare minimum to play counterstrike is if you hit 50 - 60 fps. My friend squeezes in 70+ FPS with an onboard graphics and has a more crappy computer than me... 

If anyone can help me, just give me some information or if you have any commands, tips etc... all appreciated!</description>

              <p>I’m running on a 256mb OnBoard graphics card. My problem isn’t as serious as yours, but it can still get a bit laggy when playing CS. All I reccomend is buying a better graphics card.</p>

              <p>what os are you using and what other programs are you running while doing this. a good way to see how much computing power a process is taking is doing ctrl + alt + del and click on the processes tab and see which ones are using the most memory. if they dont need to be run, you should close them.</p>
