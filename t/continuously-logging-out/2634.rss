    <title>Continuously logging out</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/continuously-logging-out/2634</link>
    <description>Weird thing iam experiencing with some scripts. Every 4-10 mins iam reconnecting almost like it idles out while its not. Its not proxy issue cuz /em2() runs just fine on that proxy. Scripts i was using noobTrain and Karamja fisher/banker by taios.
Any ide what the problem is?

              <p>ok i found out its the script that idles.<br>
like all the fisher scripts (draynor netter, karamja…) it only clicks ones to begin fishing, eventually it idles and logs out.</p>
<p>why noone has posted this before?</p>
