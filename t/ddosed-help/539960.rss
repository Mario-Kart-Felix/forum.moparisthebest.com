    <description>Some loser from another server got my IP address and Ddosed me. I&#39;m on an iMac, but at the time I was on my installed Windows 7 via Bootcamp. So I came back to Mac OS X and deleted the windows partition.

(feel free to move section)

(this is my default gateway, under Logs)
Anyone have any ideas how to kick his IP from trying to connect to my router or whatever?
Code:

[Admin login] from source 192.168.1.6.
[LAN access from remote] from 173.35.240.198:3323 to 192.168.1.12:43594.

[Log Cleared]

UPDATE: After Erasing the port forward made in router, those have stopped coming up.

Additional info would be helpful 

Refreshed Logs this came up:
[UPnP set event: Public_UPNP_C5] from source 192.168.1.3. &lt;-- Attached devices says that this is my iPhones-IP address.
