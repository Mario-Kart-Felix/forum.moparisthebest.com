    <description>back long ago runescape had pking which was very good there was luring etc.
ok back on the topic, say your pking some newb just runs from spec, and your character just follows and doesn&#39;t spec while following also is the same problem with ranging, if some one is running away in old rs (pking) you follow sideways and range. in private servers you don&#39;t you just stay in one spot for long and range and when a person is far away it says Your target is too far way or you cant range from here sumthing like that.

what i want: to be able to follow and hit while pking.
purpose: to stop ppl from running from spec and escaping from someone ranging</description>
