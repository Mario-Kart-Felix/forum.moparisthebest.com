Today, I&#39;m at my grandparents house and am cursed with the sad internet connection know as dial up..... I am try to play a server called NeverBackDown and you can look it up if youw ant blahblahblah... NOT ADVERTISING! JUST SAYING WHAT ITS CALLED SO PEOPLE CAN BETTER HELP ME WITH MY PROBLEM BY CHECKING IT OUT! I never have this problem on my high speed computer at home, but when I open up the webclient it says 
error loading - please report when I&#39;m on my grandparents dial-up. Can somebody tell me how to fix this or if it is unfixable?</description>

<p>Wrong, my mobile phone is my internet modem and it is a 56k dial-up connection and I host a server all day long.</p>
<p>It’s only bytes streaming in and out when packets are sent. The rest is client sided meaning I don’t have to handle people’s model and animation loading because that’s handled on their side.</p>
<p>Are YOU sure YOU know what YOU’RE talking about? And for the record, I have an old 448MB RAM desktop with over 60 processes running.</p>

<p>LOL, All i can do is laugh at you, Dialup is reliable, its just a little bit slower, ive hosted off dialup for friends from my real life school, and it held about 50 with a very small 1/4 second delay…</p>
