    <description>                                          [b][size=24pt] UPDATED [/size][/b]


currently trying to fix up a 562 server using pkmadness&#39;s source by crezzy, it had tons of errors and nulls when i got it and i fixed majority of them. im stuck with 3-4 big errors at the moment to at least get the server decently running. 

1. my first error is huge, the hp and prayer bar next to the minimap are nulled/stuck at 0 for all players/levels and i cannot seem to find where the problem is ive spent hours upon hours searching through all my handlers/files and i have a pretty good knowledge base with coding so far.
