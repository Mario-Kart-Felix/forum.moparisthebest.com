<p>That makes sense, like a hollow-point bullet would grab clothes where a full metal jacket might not.</p>

<p>Yup, I think you hear these sorts of stories most from prison doctors (as statistically there’s probably more people in prison with gun shot wounds than a normal doctor would ever see) because some fragments of bullets make their way to the surface of the skin gradually over time, although I think most stay put.</p>

<p>Bare in mind before guns our weapons were far more brutal and people survived all kinds of injuries. We might be bags of flesh but we’re tougher than we look.</p>
