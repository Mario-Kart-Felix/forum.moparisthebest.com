[center]Well i was thinking its basicaly about time we made a 470 cache!
all i need to have is a cache repacker
but i also need a team to get all models code alot and suttf like that
i will be using a server to connect to so i need someone to code a server i was thinking about mine but i dont want to be selfish
So if someone is willing to give me they&#39;r server source i will be very heppy  :)
I will also need someone who will find the models for me and the game sprites (maybe a little better than real runescape)
[/center]
Need someone to give me a cache repacker also
Fill out this form if you are willing to give me you&#39;r cache repacker (will be on the credits)
&lt;blockquote&gt;Are you willing:
Do you want me to give to anyone els:
Do you trust?:
Comments:&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So lets move on to the server base if someone is willing to give me.
Must be called project-IQ
Must Hold alot of players (70+ no lagg)
Must have anti null protection
Blocker from global mods Attacking
