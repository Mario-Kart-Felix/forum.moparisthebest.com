    <title>I need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help/19097</link>
    <description>Okay.. I was wondering if anyone has a code for FOLLOWING. There have been many times where I just need to click 80 times to follow rather than simply clicking one button, and it is getting annoying.

Also, I was wondering if someone could tell me how to change what the log out button says in TestScape? There is a tutorial on it, but from what I could see, the tutorial only said how to change the text above the button. Then, I need to know how to get that text to stay here. Usually, the text there just carries over from other servers if I have played one in the past.

Also2, I need to know how to change NPC drops. I did the code from xerozcheez called like &quot;NPCs drop all&quot; and it worked fine in a previous server, but that is not what I want. Basically, I want to start the drops over from scratch, then add them in one by one. Could someone please tell me how to do this?

Thanks,

<p>I am having trouble with the logout button though. I changed the text, but now I am having a problem that it will not stay like that. The text carries over from other servers.</p>
