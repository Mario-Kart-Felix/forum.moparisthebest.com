    <title>I need help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help/201615</link>
    <description>ok well there&#39;s 2 things i want to do with my server right now, but i can&#39;t seem to find out how to do it.

first thing is to make people keep all of their items when they die, (if possible, only when killed by another player)
(this is because im sick of people b****ing about looters )
i&#39;ve tried do delete all of the deleteitems from the applydead and the youdied voids in client.java

second thing i want to do is to make certain weapons and armor only equipable by a certain player right.  for example: a weapon intended for the admins would only be equipable for people who have admin priveleges or higher, but not lower.  
i have no idea where to start with this, so i havent tried anything yet.  can anyone help?</description>
