    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help/548359</link>
    <description>Hey! I am a complete N00B at this! I have taken a few computer science courses in highschool (where I am currently) and have been playing rs for a long time. I never even knew there was anything like this. I really want to make at least just a simple client to start. I would love the source code to a client but it would be amazing if there was even a tutorial with it :) I was wondering if someone could help me.  :palm: :confused:</description>

<p>You’ll find that most servers come with a client, both of which you can edit and mess around with. For example, <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,664755.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a> is an example from the downloads section, that server comes with both a client and server. There are also many other servers, some better or worse than others in that section. You can probably find a standalone server or client in that section also if you search for one.</p>
<p>Any server tutorials can be found <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,51.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">in this section</a> and its subsections.

<p>Informing about “making a client” was necessary so he understands how it all works, as he was asking the wrong question.</p>

I’m just gonna say… If you go to runescape and view-source their page… You can find the applet.</p>
<p>Note: You’ll have to find the iframe for the page, and then view source THAT page to get the .jar.</p>
<p>Here is a link to one: (don’t believe me, go do it yourself…) <a href="http://world6a.runescape.com/gamepacklsP0p8mvNFWryKP38Bd5mXu9Yyn7HgWs_2132957.jar" rel="nofollow noopener">http://world6a.runescape.com/gamepacklsP0p8mvNFWryKP38Bd5mXu9Yyn7HgWs_2132957.jar</a></p>
