              <p><a href="http://Java.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Java.com</a> for jdk downloads. Be sure your windows firewall is off. If you’re using a router turn off the security on your wireless connection. If you’re using no-ip and the other person can’t connect, use your static IP to connect. Also, before you ask, no, I’m not going to go into team viewer and help you. It’s too simple and I cba.</p>
<p>EDIT: I’m not sure if it’s called static IP or not but, I meant by using the IP located at the bottom right of your post. It will have a red wire image to the left of your IP. Also, don’t worry, it’s only visible to you and moderators+.</p>
