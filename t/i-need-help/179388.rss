    <description>[b]THIS IS GETTING ANNOYING[/b]


I&#39;ve been putting up my server for the best 2 weeks but their has been a big problem since. I don&#39;t know what kind of stupid server this is but I really like it. The problem is that everytime a players screen freezes or everytime a player gets a connection lost during they are on my server, half of them come back with a reset account. [b]THIS IS NOT GOOD!!! [/b]

I&#39;m sure that this has something to do with Player.Handler....Player.Java???

But I really really have no clue why this is happening. The players are getting upset with the way the server is reseting their accounts. If anyone has any [b]CLUE[/b] why this is happening. Please HElp!</description>
