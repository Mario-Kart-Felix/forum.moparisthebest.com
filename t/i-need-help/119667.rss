    <description>I need help on how to make a server.  Like, do I have to hand type all the code in the client.JAVA, or can I get a program to make the code for me, I know how to make objects, but not a village, I dont know how to make ground.  If anyone could help me, I would like to start making my own servers and posting them on here  :)</description>

              <p>Making a whole new village like varrock is hard to doâ€¦ u can make self a place like an island thats for moderators only. I never seen programs that give u the right code for it. U can always ask here an expert for help via PM.</p>
