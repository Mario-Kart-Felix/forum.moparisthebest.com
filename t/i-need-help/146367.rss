              <p>Go into your Client.Java (or the notepad) and hold “Ctrl+F” and type a command you know from that server and do not use the ::'s only put the name of it and you should see something like this - <code>if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("CMD")</code></p>
<p>Under it after you see the “{” hit enter until your one line away from that letter, add this after that -</p>
<p><code>if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("your CMD") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0)
			{
				addItem(Item ID number, 1);
sendMessage("Your message");
}</code></p>
<p>Make sure the command under it is spaced to.</p>
<p>That is for item commands. after you have added it save it and then compile it.<br>
If you get an error search for that new command you entered and try looking over my instructions.<br>
You can add more items by clicking at the end of the line <code>addItem(ITEM ID number, 1);</code><br>
Just hit enter and type this <code>addItem(ITEM ID, 1);</code><br>
Also where it says Item ID jsut put the number of the item you want there.</p>
<p>Also where it says player rights and how it has a “0”  0 is for regular players and up can use it if you put a 1 moderators and up can use the command and 2 for admin and up and 3 for owner and up “3” is as high as it gets so don’t put anything higher than 3.</p>
