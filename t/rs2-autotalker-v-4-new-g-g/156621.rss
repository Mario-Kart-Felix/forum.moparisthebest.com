    <title>[RS2] AutoTalker V.4 New G.G</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2-autotalker-v-4-new-g-g/156621</link>
    <description>New!: V.4 was taken and rewriten to have added Anit-Randoms! Now you can be at a famous selling spot and just have SCAR declaring your text and just incase some random person would come to you and speak V.4 will deal with them and keep on going. V.4 has also been added with a feature that stops the procedure if your not logged into Runescape. Think about it this way if your not logged in it wont go typing all your edited text in things like Browsers that your in or even SCAR if your still on that. V.4 has been named New G.G for New Game Generation.

Please post any bugs, even though I&#39;ve tested this like crazy I dont think there are any bugs but you never know.

For the people who like to download the script the download will be availaible below.
This is my 5th script and even though its pretty basic I already know a lot of stuff like even forms so if you think this script is horrible go ahead and let your feelings express themselves by posting. Dont give me some slack give me a whack!

<p>Well first download the file or just copy and paste it into SCAR. Then what you want to do is type in the messages you want it to type. then press the play button and clikc on your runescape window. I used SCAR Divi 3.12c</p>

Arrays? what are those? And if what I think I’m seeing in that procedure is right then that would be easier for me.<br>

Arrays are variables with a numeric value in their name. It’s a little hard to explain so here’s an example:</p>
<p>Try it out <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
<p>[code]<br>
program AutoTalker;</p>
<p>var i: integer;<br>
SendMessage: array [0…5] of string;<br>
//Variable “SendMessage” has 6 values (0 - 5), each defines as SendMessage[x]<br>
//x being a number 0 - 5</p>
<p>begin<br>
SendMessage[0]:= ‘Message 1’;<br>
SendMessage[1]:= ‘Message 2’;<br>
SendMessage[2]:= ‘Message 3’;<br>
SendMessage[3]:= ‘Message 4’;<br>
SendMessage[4]:= ‘Message 5’;<br>
SendMessage[5]:= ‘Message 6’; //See? 6 messages</p>
<p>repeat<br>
i:= Random(Length(SendMessage) - 1);<br>
//i = 0 through 5, which is the range of values we found earlier<br>
//Length counts the amount of values SendMessage has.<br>
//You need - 1 because when it counts it starts at 1, and without it<br>
//it would return values 1 - 6, when you want 0 - 5</p>
<pre><code>writeLn(SendMessage[i]);
</code></pre>
<p>//Now it’s just a matter of sending the message. It will send a<br>
//random value of SendMessage which corrisponds with i<br>
//Feel free to replace “writeLn” with TypeSend or SendKeys<br>
wait(300);<br>
until(false)<br>
end.</p>

I think I get it… but do you know of a TUT for arrays somewere?[br][size=1]Posted on: November 08, 2007, 02:51:15 PM[/size][hr]Killerofpure If you need any help just ask it right here</p>

              <p>New!: V.4 was taken and rewriten to have added Anit-Randoms! Now you can be at a famous selling spot and just have SCAR declaring your text and just incase some random person would come to you and speak V.4 will deal with them and keep on going. V.4 has also been added with a feature that stops the procedure if your not logged into Runescape. Think about it this way if your not logged in it wont go typing all your edited text in things like Browsers that your in or even SCAR if your still on that. V.4 has been named New G.G for New Game Generation.</p>
