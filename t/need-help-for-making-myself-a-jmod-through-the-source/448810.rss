    <description>Hi guys, I only recently became interested in making my own rsps, I have done everything i need to do to set it up, I just need to know how to make myself a jmod and where and how :L, I am quite a novice to this stuff, but it looks fun! If any of you would also leave your skype names and would be willing to help me become a little bit better it would be much appreciated :), thanks for your time guys, hope to hear from you  :)</description>
