    <title>I need help from a good coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-help-from-a-good-coder/246416</link>
    <description>I myself know the basics. I can code commands, understand some java, etc. But, I am in need of help from a good coder.

I am tired of it, and I really need to put this to a stop. Duping.

The only duping method I am aware of is:

1. The player(s) trade eachother.
2. Both players accept the trade, then as it is accepted, they click soemwhere on the mini-map.
3. Both players keep/recieve the item(s).


Can anyone help me on how to remove this? I am tired of having to crack down on peoples accounts, etc.</description>
