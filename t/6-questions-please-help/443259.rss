    <title>6 Questions - Please help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/6-questions-please-help/443259</link>
    <description>Hello again, i have a few questions, if you could tell me the awnser or throw a link at me for the tutorial that would be great.

1) How would i make the interface for a rsps tool and which program would i use to make this rsps tool work?
2)How do you make that partical effect or whatever like in runescape for the comp. cape?
3)Is there any tutorials for a working G.E?
4)How would you make a custom shop?
5)How would you add rewards from killing someone in the wild?
6)Is it possiable to make a custom empty space for a monster? Like when you step in the portal to go fight bork, you go to a big area with only bork? Something like that.

Thank you for all your help!:)</description>

2) I mean that white stuff at the bottem at the cape that moves? I heard people call it particals so thats what i called it, i don’t know the right term.<br>
3)Can you link me to a tutorial?</p>
<p>Thanks;)[/quote]</p>
<p>1.) There is no “right” download it depends on the version you’re capable and comfortable with using.<br>
2.) Oh, particles. That’s a new system Jagex uses so that they no longer have to rely on bulky polygon techniques. I have no idea how you would go about actually recreating said effect, if even possible, on a rsps. I have no expertise in this area what-so-ever.<br>
3.) Just use the search board feature in the tutorials section.</p>

              <p>1.) I’m assuming you mean how to make a GUI, VB works great.<br>
2.) I’m not quite sure I understand this, so I won’t answer.<br>
3.) Yes.<br>
4.) Open your shop handler class, find out how shops are handled (usually a cfg file in ./data/), create the shop by adding items/amounts, add that shop to open upon first/second click of an NPC.<br>
5.) Check if the user is in the wilderness (there should be a boolean depending on your base that already does this), add that to the “applyDead” method (from PI, I think) and then have a random item from an array chosen and given.<br>
6.) Yes, just add a monster to an empty area. If you mean making custom map data for that specific purpose make use of peterbjornx’s work.</p>
