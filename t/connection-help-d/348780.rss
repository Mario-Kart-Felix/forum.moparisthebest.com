    <description>alright, last night, I was updating some things On my server, and while I was doing this, my pc crashed, and now I can&#39;t get in the game, I even ran the server from the file backup files I had, but I go in the game.. wait like 5 seconds and I can&#39;t move, and I disconnect &gt;.&gt; 
if any of you know how to fix this please help.. I know it&#39;s not the server, because other people don&#39;t do this.. me, my computer, and my other computer are the only ones that do this, and the reason the other pc does, is because we are on the same router.. any ideas on how tofix this??</description>

              <p>I would suggest calling either the company that you got the router from or calling the company that you got your computer from.  Ask them for details on how to fix it.</p>
