    <title>Stop Spamming - Please Read These Rules!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-spamming-please-read-these-rules/39248</link>
    <description>In order to use the forum you must agree to all of these rules as well:

We are not anti-leech. If you respect our community and our ideas, feel free to ask questions and they will be kindly answered if you follow other rules. Answer to questions that others ask if you know the answer or remain silent!

We don&#39;t talk about things we don&#39;t know. This is an informative, not uninformative community.

We don&#39;t make spelling mistakes on purpose. We use &quot;you&quot; not &quot;u&quot;, we use &quot;why&quot; not &quot;y&quot; etc.

We don&#39;t make posts that contain useless information. Posts like &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;lol&quot;, &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;I agree&quot; don&#39;t contain anything useful for others. We are not fans of off topic, unless it contains something smart or funny. Most of things spammers find funny are actually not funny at all.

We don&#39;t &quot;bump&quot; or double post.

We respect each other and other communities. We don&#39;t flame each other or other communities. We don&#39;t fight on the forums.

We don&#39;t advertise other sites or communities unless we ask and receive permission to and from moparisthebest. We don&#39;t post links to sites that are not in safe sites list on moparisthebest.com main page.

We don&#39;t care about post count alone. If someone has high post count and most of it is spam, we hate him. If someone has high post count with informative posts, we love him. The higher count, the more we hate/love him.

We don&#39;t talk about &quot;rep&quot; ever, whether you are asking for it or saying that you have given it.

DO NOT post or upload any copyrighted materials, ie deobs, clients or any other sort.

We don&#39;t sell anything on these forums with the exception of SCAR scripts.

We never have misleading links in your signatures. If your signature says www.google.com, we expect it to take us to google.com.

Nothing to do with private servers belongs on moparisthebest.com, use moparisthebest.com for these things.







please read the rules and abide by them, we dont want the whole community to turn into crippled old cows being flung over the china wall.</description>
