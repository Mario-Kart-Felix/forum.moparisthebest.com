    <description>alright well i got my pure perm banned for breaking one rule and they said

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have reviewed your account, and have decided to not grant your appeal. You have continued to break our rules, time and time again, and due to the severity of these offences as well as your attitude within RuneScape, we have decided that your account will remain permanently banned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

i only broke the rules once and i only broke 1 rule

then my friend got pissed because he thought it was a good pure and said this

&lt;blockquote&gt;FUCK YOU JAGEX STAFF YOU FUCKING CUNT SUCKING NIGGER ASS JEW FUCKING DICK SUCKING CHINK ASS COCK SUCKING SEMEN DRINKING BASTARD ASS FUCKING BITCHS

GO FUCK YOURSELF!

YOU BAN ME FOR NO REASON NOW I FUCKING KILL YOU&lt;/blockquote&gt;

so jagex replied this (although i am already perm banned)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Please do not send in any more messages like this as if you continue to be abusive towards us, it could result in your account being suspended or banned from the game&lt;/blockquote&gt;

all i have to say is they are morons...


this has nothing to do with me being banned so its not agaisnt the rules so stop spamming about it.. im posting about jagex being idiots. god read people</description>

<p>He didn’t ask what’s inside the mod section, and you clearly don’t know.  You’re describing the mod section leak which may have or may not have been real.  If it was real, the forums existed, and they were never ‘taken out.’  It only looked like that in the mod leak because they would have to direct link to the real forums or copy every page of the forums, either of which is completely useless.</p>

<p>i only broke the rules once and i only broke 1 rule</p>
<p>then my friend got pissed because he thought it was a good pure and said this</p>
<blockquote>FUCK YOU JAGEX STAFF YOU FUCKING CUNT SUCKING NIGGER ASS JEW FUCKING DICK SUCKING CHINK ASS COCK SUCKING SEMEN DRINKING BASTARD ASS FUCKING BITCHS
<p>GO FUCK YOURSELF!</p>

<p>so jagex replied this (although i am already perm banned)</p>
<blockquote>Please do not send in any more messages like this as if you continue to be abusive towards us, it could result in your account being suspended or banned from the game</blockquote>
<p>all i have to say is they are morons…</p>
