    <description>Hi, in my server theres a problem.

i realized that people are having a problems in my server.

after a while, they cannot login...it logs in but theres a black screen and it says loading-please wait

this problem only gets fixed when i edit in their character file...i have to change where they are located in..so they can login

is there any other way i can fix this problem?</description>
