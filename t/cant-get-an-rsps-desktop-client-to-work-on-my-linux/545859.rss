    <title>Can&#39;t get an RSPS desktop client to work on my LINUX</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-an-rsps-desktop-client-to-work-on-my-linux/545859</link>
    <description>I am not trying to run my own server, im trying to play a friends. but the website doesnt connect for me ever, and i don&#39;t know why.
so he gave me the desktop client through skype, and now when i download cache and everything it gives me a black screen with options to do, saying Try different Java. Reload Browser.  Reboot computer.. etc... ive done all the options.

Im running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.</description>

and change “java -jar” to “javaw -jar”  in the shell file and that should solve the “little unusable window”[/quote]<br>
What code sorry? and i changed it javaw and it said the command wasn’t found but there are 19 similar commands.</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with Linux. In your client, you should see a signlink.java or a folder called sign, and in there a file called signlink.java. Open that up, go to <a href="http://pastebin.com" rel="nofollow noopener">pastebin.com</a>, paste the code there, and give us the link</p>

<p>This is a friends client he’s running so he may not have access to the .java</p>
<p>Make sure your friend isn’t setting the cache directory to anything starting with  C:<br>
Linux doesn’t have that drive by default like windows does, so when you try to use the cache and put it in that directory, it errors.</p>
