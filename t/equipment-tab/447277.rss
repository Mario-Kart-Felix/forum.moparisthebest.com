    <description>Hey Mopar,

So i&#39;m making a &quot;Weapon Game&quot; on my server. To quickly explain, you start with a bronze dagger, and when you kill another player in the minigame, your weapon is upgraded to a bronze sword and next time to a bronze mace, etc..

My problem is when you kill another player in the minigame, your weapon does correctly change to the next rank, but in the players equipment tab it still says you have your previous weapon. So if you kill someone with the bronze dagger, your bronze dagger is deleted and a bronze sword is put in your weapon slot. The character is holding the bronze sword, but in his equipment slot it still shows a bronze dagger.

Is there are way for me to refresh/update the equipment tab so it shows the correct items?

Thanks  :)</description>
