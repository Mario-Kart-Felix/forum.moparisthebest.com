    <title>A Server that Works with The REAL 194 Client!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-server-that-works-with-the-real-194-client/528299</link>
    <description>I need this badly! If ANYONE has a server that the ----ACTUAL---- 194 client can run on can you please give me a link???? I just got my client to work but it isnt working on any server!!!!

This means the server has some type of fatigue system.

THANKS!!!

R.I.P,
