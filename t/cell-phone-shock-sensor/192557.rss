    <title>Cell phone shock sensor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cell-phone-shock-sensor/192557</link>
    <description>My cousins cell phone stopped working, he thinks it was dropped, and called his provider, they said that the new icon on the screen is a &quot;car kit&quot; or something like that, it looks like the front of a car, I am guessing this is something like the moisture detecting sticker under the battery, is there a way to disable it so he can get a new phone?

The phone is an LG ax490.

Thanks in advanced</description>

              <p>I don’t think there is a full way to “disable” a cell phone, but there is one thing he can do that <span class="bbcode-i">might</span> get him a brand knew phone depending on the service provider and how they deal with stolen cell phones. Anyways, what you do is you enter the following into your cell phone “<span class="hashtag">#06</span>#A15” A number will appear on the screen. <span class="bbcode-b">Write the number down, you will need it later.</span> Then you go to/contact your service provider and say “I have lost my cell phone, I have the de-activating code, could you disable it please?” they will then ask for the number you wrote down, give that to them. Depending on the service provider they may or may not give you a new phone, so I suggest finding out about these kinds of things in advance, otherwise you will never be able to use the old cell phone again, regardless if a new SIM card is put in.</p>
<p>There is a small “tutorial” on it on google. It can be found at the link below. Good luck to you/your cousin!<br>
