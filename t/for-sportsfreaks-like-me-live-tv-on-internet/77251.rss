    <description>Hey all,

The only NBA and NCAA action I would get is by watching ESPN Gamecast online cuz I couldn&#39;t afford to play like over 200 bucks a league pass, now theres an easier way apparently. There is something called SopCast and its P2P Streaming. It channels live TV and spreads it among users. 

To watch NBA, MLB, NHL and other sports not worthy to mention (Yes I hate the NFL!):

Download Sopcast: 

www.download.sopcast.com

After installing it you can create an account and login, you can browse channels, watch movies or watch sports but sometimes the sports channels have weird names like WBOE and stuff, so:

got to www.dewsaw.com and go to schedule and click on the link under the match/game and it will ask permission to open in Sopcast, say launch application and Voila! Live Sports Broadcast! :D

Spread the Word ;)

BTW Idk about Virus or trojans I never scanned but a lot of my friends use this and nothing happened to them so I assume its safe, it would be great if someone can post a scan log or such.</description>
