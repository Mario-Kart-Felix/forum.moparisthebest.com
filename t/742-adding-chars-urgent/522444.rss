    <description>hey guys, so on rune-evo by default you are a man, it does give you the option to change your char/hairstyle and clothes when you speak to eva however the buttons dont open up action&#39;s, and theres no file that contains the interface for this. the reason for that is obviously because rune evo dosnt have it, so i have to implement it myself. i want to know the best way to do this, how can i add this in if rune evo dosnt support it (witch it does) and what would be the best way to get started? Any helps appreciated thanks!</description>
