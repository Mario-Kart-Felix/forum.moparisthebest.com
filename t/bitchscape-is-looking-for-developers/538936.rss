[size=14pt][abbr=But we can change that]Where bitches are reborn[/abbr][/size][/shadow][/center]

It&#39;s time I crack down and get serious about my development. I started it way to long ago and have made very, very little progress. This [u]will[/u] change.

[anchor=qual]Am I qualified?[/anchor]
      Yes. No matter what skills you have, there is an open spot on my staff for you. However, that doesn&#39;t mean you will get much privileges/access nor does it guarantee you a position on my team. But all members of the BS staff will get staff rights in-game, and have access to staff-only content (this content may be on the server or forums, all server-based staff content will not be accessible by players and it will [b]not[/b] give staff an advantage).
[iurl=#top][abbr=Back to Table of Contents]Back to ToC[/iurl]

[anchor=look]What positions are you looking for?[/anchor]
      I have plenty open spots on my staff team as of right now, and as we grow as a community I will require more staff. Here is the current staff list:

[ul][li]Server Developers:[/li]
[list]
[li][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=341531]Sk8rdude461[/url] - Lead Developer[/li]
[li][url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=672004]ruzylo[/url][/li]
[li]&lt;Open (Maybe)&gt;[/li]

[li]Client Developers:[/li]
[list]

[li]&lt;Open&gt;[/li]
[li]&lt;Open&gt;[/li]
[li]&lt;Open&gt;[/li]
[li]&lt;Open&gt;[/li]
[/list][/ul]

[iurl=#top][abbr=Back to Table of Contents]Back to ToC[/iurl]

[anchor=entitle]What does each role entitle?[/anchor]
      Of course you&#39;d ask this question. No one wants to join a development team unless they get something out of it. Below is an explanation of what each role is entitled to, both in game and on the forums.

[ul][li]Server Developer[/li][/ul]

       A server developer is entitled to all privileges both on the server and on the forums. This will include access to all commands, teleport locations, and hidden sections of the forums. 

[ul][li]Client Developer[/li][/ul]

       A client developer is entitled to all privileges that a server developer is. Both of them are considered equal ranks, and will have equal power.

[ul][li]Forum Staff[/li][/ul]

       Forum staff are the backbone of our less-than-active community. You are entitled access to [u]all[/u]* forums and will have an in-game icon representing your rank. However, forum staff will only have one &#39;power&#39; command in game, and that is the power to kick.

[ul][li]Server Helpers[/li][/ul]

       As a Server helper you will receive an in-game rank as well as access to a few of the staff forums. You will not have power-based commands in game. However, you will have access to valuable information that will help you in your role as a server helper.

*Some boards will be off limits to forum staff, such as server/client developer boards.
[iurl=#top][abbr=Back to Table of Contents]Back to ToC[/iurl]

[anchor=do]What do I have to do?[/anchor]
       Now that you know what *most* (as I haven&#39;t fully decided on what the staff will receive/have access to) of the benefits are for becoming staff** you&#39;re going to want to know what you are required to do, right? Below is an explanation of what each staff member must do.

[ul][li]Server Developer[/li][/ul]

       You will be required to do constant updates to the server. This includes bug fixes, adding/removing content, as well as general maintenance. All work must be logged in some form of a development log. You are [b]not[/b] required to be online daily, nor are you required to do daily updates. I request at minimal a [u]weekly[/u] update from you. I understand that some work requires the client developers to finish their end first, but generally there should be something for you to work on.

[ul][li]Client Developer[/li][/ul]

       Just like a server developer, you&#39;re required to keep a development log. Most of the client work will be working with packets, creating new interfaces, and adding/removing new content.

[ul][li]Forum Staff[/li][/ul]

       This job isn&#39;t as interesting as server/client developer, nor will it require as much work. You will be in charge of removing forum spam, giving users forum-based ranks (at least, until I find a way to add an automated system), and (depending on how much I trust you) adding/removing new boards. While I expect you to be on the forums a lot (since it really isn&#39;t hard to log onto the forums, look at the new content, and log off) you aren&#39;t required to be in-game often.

[ul][li]Server Helpers[/li][/ul]

       You play a vital role in helping the community in-game. You will be in charge of helping players find their way around the server, and answer general-knowledge questions about the server (such as: where are ____ monsters?). I trust you to help build a good community. Server helpers are required to log in to the game at least [b]three[/b] times a week. The reason for this is because they are expect to [u]help[/u] the players.
**In-game staff such as admins and moderators will be picked based on their performance in the community. There will be no application what so ever. Applications for said roles make people drive for [i]only[/i] that role and usually after that they stop actually caring about the community and overall about the server. While it&#39;s voluntarily, members are appoint by the staff.
[iurl=#top][abbr=Back to Table of Contents]Back to ToC[/iurl]

[anchor=app]How do I apply?[/anchor]
       Now that I&#39;ve filled this thread full of bland text, I guess I should tell you how to apply to be apart of the BS staff team. It&#39;s a very simple process; you fill out the application, attempt to get people to vouch for you (the more realistic vouches the better), and then I (and if there are other members, we) will decide if you deserve the role.
[code=AppFormat][u]Personal Information[/u]:

[ul][li]Name:[/li]
[li]Age:[/li]
[li]Country of Residence/Timezone:[/li][/ul]

[u]Application Information[/u]

[ul][li]Position:[/li]
[li]Past Experience/Work (none of the &quot;I&#39;ve been a mod 5 times&quot;):[/li]
[li]Vouches:[/li][/ul]

[/code]
[iurl=#top][abbr=Back to Table of Contents]Back to ToC[/iurl]

[anchor=final]Final notes:
     I understand that this thread may look bland, and is full of text. This is not my advertisement of my server. I have posted this thread in hopes of gaining new staff, not gaining a player base. If you would like to view some media of my project, you can do so [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,648217.0.html]here[/url]. I am using a PI base with a renamed client. I will not switch over to another base, at least not for this development. Credits to flame_ for the staff application. I am also looking for a graphics master (of some form). I didn&#39;t add it into the actual thread because, well I don&#39;t know. If you are willing to help with graphics, please post below (I really want to see work) or pm me.</description>

Few occasions where I took over servers after owners went off on some random hiatus. Most servers were 10 - 30 players and just generic mod positions. Played random RSPS for past 5 years, bit generic but it’s some experience.</p>

<a href="http://Rage-scape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Rage-scape.com</a> , doubt the owner likes me after I left the server after his 2 month disappearance. I had VPS, website, and webhost information. No other vouches.<br>

<p>Based on that first image, it honestly looks like you used a template. I’m also not exactly looking for a website developer as of now. I basically anything website related I need done I can do myself.</p>
<p>[hr]<br>
Everyone needs to stop asking about vouches. The point of a vouch is for you to have someone that will stand by you with what you said on your application. Look at the people that backed ruzylo. That’s what I’m talking about.</p>

[list][li]Past Experience/Work (none of the “I’ve been a mod 5 times”):[/li][/list]Well, I’ve been an admin like 5 times… JK… But I’m not the best developer and probably ot good at all to be honest, however I did put it as I’m willing to learn more and whatnot. As far as forums go, I’m currently admin on paladious, though since its dead I’m not active anymore. I ran my own server which didn’t do to bad. I know my way around any forums software. I’m always on the forums on my phone, and on my comp and I prefer forums to ingame most the time.<br>
[list][li]Vouches:[/li][/list]Guess I have none, I’ve talked to you alot on skype. I’ve worked with nolan and he’s seen my dedication when I find something worth dedicating to. And L&amp;P played pala when I was admin, however with it dead, nothing much to administrate. They may vouch and they may not. Tom loves me though whether he knows who I am or not so thats good!<br>
(I’ve worked with riley/atomicint aswell, not sure his view on me but he has also seen my dedication.)</p>
