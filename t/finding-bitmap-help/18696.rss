    <description>Ive been playing around with the different find bitmaps and i have ran into a problem, whenever i try to find all bitmaps that are the same in a client it only finds 1 and then stops, to correct this would i have to have it loop and check and see if the coords are different from the last bitmaps found, or is their an actual way of it to search for all bitmaps that are the same</description>

<p>I had a big discussion with some other scripters about this, and the only resonable solution we could come up with were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check bitmaps and see if coords are similar or not.  Limitations if bitmaps move, and it could just keep finding the same on again and again</li>
<li>Create a series of small boxes and search for the bitmaps one at a time in each box, then add up your total.  The problem with this though is that scar could easily miss some bitmaps because of limitation of boxes or could count some twice.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one of the areas SCAR lacks in[/quote]</p>
<p>I made a procedure to find the yellow banker dots in port phasmatys that are like this<br>
x x      x x<br>
by dividing the minimap (well most of it) into boxes, and find points with yellow, 1 per box, hoping/assuming I would only get 1 hit per banker. Sometimes I get 2 (1 banker dot spread over 2 boxes) and I guess I could try making the boxes bigger but would risk getting 2 bankers in 1 box. So I ended up elminating these problems with analysis of distances between the hits, ie far enough apart that they were from different bankers, but close enough to know that they were the bankers next to each other and not the ghost villagers outside the bank. Looks like any method would need another method to check it to eliminate false positives. If you’re going to risk find the bitmap too many times or not enough, I would go with too many and then weed out.</p>

              <p>well if you see what i did in the first scar script section what i did was have it find the bitmap then perform the search again starting at where the last bitmap was found and add 1 to the coordinate so it wouldnt get stuck looping <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.org/smf/index.php/topic,28315.0.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.org/smf/index.php/topic,28315.0.html</a></p>
