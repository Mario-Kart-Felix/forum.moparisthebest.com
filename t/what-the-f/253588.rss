    <description>ok, i was making a new thread section in my server

thread section guild

all i did was add
[code]
if(playerInGuild &amp;&amp; playerJoinGuild){
sM(&quot;You cant join another guild.&quot;);
guildUpdateRequired = true;
}
}
}
}
[/code]

thats my guild coding, guilds work...

but when i compiled it said

[code]
client.java 4896: wrong statement

guildUpdateRequired = true;
                                   ^
&quot;;&quot; needed

wtf????

basically i fixed this, but when i log on server...

this is what happens


you have joined guild 1
you cant join another guild
you cant join another guild
you cant join another guild

[it says that over and over]

even though i wasn&#39;t trying to join a guild...

then when i fixed that i made mana construction...

so i did

if(p.mana &gt; 3000 &amp;&amp; currentActionTimer &amp;&amp; actionInterval){
sM(&quot;You dont have enough mana to make this.&quot;);
} else
createServerObject(98607, temp.absX, temp.absY, temp.heightlevel);
sM(&quot;You create a basic guild house.&quot;);
}

i compiled this, and i got 1 error

it says that p.mana isn&#39;t a statement

even though i have p.mana ike a bunch of times for spells and other construction stuff...

help?[/code]</description>
