    <description>Ok so i have downloaded a source and client (to get my RS fix at work, shhh don&#39;t tell my boss!). Everything is great except the banks don&#39;t work, the objects are there but clicking on them does nothing. How do i get this to work. Its a 317 if that helps. I have no intention of releasing this BTW its just for my pleasure!

Thanks

              <p>Hi Dukey, can you provide a tiny bit more information about the server you have, thanks the revision number but there are still some differences in servers.</p>
<p>Do you have any knowledge on Java as you will have to add a case in the objects file for the interaction you are trying to make.</p>
<p>If you want a working server to just play on you should probably find a different source as the one you picked up sounds quite incomplete.<br>
Dragon-Age was recently released which is a 317 which has a lot of working features already.</p>
<p>Kind Regards<br>
