    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-i-need-help-on-this-fresh-blank-source-please/553717</link>
    <description>Ok i got a couple questions and if you know how to do any of this may you please help me? I very much would appriciate any help to help me start developing my own client and source fresh.

#1 There is no special Bar under my combat icon, with any weapons. (ags, dds, and whip). How can i add special bar to these 3 weapons?

#2 I want to add a prayer such as turmoil to my prayers, how can i add it? and the bonuses as in att str and def.

#3 op ring, How can i make my op ring hit max with the weapons str, Example) i want to make my whip hit it&#39;s max damage every hit, not 1 hit kill stuff just see what the max hit of +82 str is. so i can buff and debuff items that are on the server to hit different max hits.

#4 How can i add ::jail command for mods - admins - and owners. 

Any help on these 4 things can help a lot!</description>
