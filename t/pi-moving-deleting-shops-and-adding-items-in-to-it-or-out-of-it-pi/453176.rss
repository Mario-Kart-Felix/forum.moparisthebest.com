    <description>Moving/Deleting NPC&#39;s

Description: How to Remove/Move NPC&#39;s
Difficulty: 0/10
Assumed Knowledge: Copy &amp; Paste Skills


First Open up Spawn-Config / Source &gt; Date &gt; Cfg &gt; Spawn-Config

In-Game, go under the NPC you are trying to Remove/Move and type in &quot;::Mypos&quot; Once you get the cords. Hit Ctrl+F, and type in the Cords you will see something like, 

spawn = 50 2456 3453 0 1 25 500 350 NPC Name

You will replace the old cords. with the new one&#39;s you like, go to your new spot type in &quot;::Mypos&quot; Replace it with the old, compile and your done. 

If you want to delete the NPC, easily just delete the line.



Description: How to Add Item&#39;s Into an Shop
Difficulty: 1/10
Assumed Knowledge: Reading Ability

First Open Up Shops / Source &gt; Data &gt; Cfg &gt; Shops

If your shop is a &quot;Armour Shop&quot; for instant you will find a Shop in there named &quot;Armour Shop&quot; here is mine for example...

shop = 66 Armor_Store 2 2 [color=red]1075[/color] [color=blue]5[/color] 1117 5 1155 5 1067 5 1115 5 1153 5 1069 5 1119 5 1157 5 1077 5 1125 5 1165 5 1071 5 1121 5 1159 5 1073 5 1123 5 1161 5 1079 5 1127 5 1163 5 1540 100

The Red is the Item Code, found on Itemdb.biz. The Blue is the Item Amount...

If you want to add a new item go to the last Item Code, and hit &quot;Tab&quot; ONE TIME. If you space when you compile it will give you an error, so be sure to hit &quot;Tab&quot; Add the Item Code, then &quot;TAB&quot; after you add the item then the Item Amount, compile and your done. 

If you want to remove an item simply remove the Item Code &amp; Item Amount

thanks and if this helped you please be sure to comment</description>
