We are a new survival pvp server that is dedicated to providing a great playing experience for all sorts of game style lovers. We have a few rules, that you will learn in-game, but the main one, and the most strictly enforced is NO HACKING!. We don&#39;t tolerate hackers, and any hackers will be instantly perm banned, no exceptions. We have just added factions so now you can create a massive team.

So, hop on to our friendly server and have some fun chilling with other players and friendly admins, cya there!


If you are looking for mod or admin or builder, just apply on the server or on forums. We are happy to give any player admin if you apply.
