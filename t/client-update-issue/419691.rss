    <title>Client Update Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-update-issue/419691</link>
    <description>Okay, so I am using a 614 server I believe, and I can get the server running just fine. I went into launch.Java and changed the IP to 127.0.0.1 so I can just test the server myself.
So anyway, like I said, the server will come up and appear to run normally, but when I try running the client it just sits at &quot;Connecting to Update server&quot;. Is there something that I missed/forgot to do?

Sorry if this is a noob question, I&#39;m really new at this :/</description>
