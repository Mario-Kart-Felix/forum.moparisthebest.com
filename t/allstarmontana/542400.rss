AGILITY:

How to train AGILITY?
First go to skills, ::skill command.

In the north-east corner, there is hanging a rope, just click on it and it will teleport you to AGILITY.

NOW what you all have to do is run the course, SEE THE PICTURES!!!

That is agility.

I HOPE ENJOY IT

Farming:
There are now 7 diffrent paths.

Level 1 Bush - Example: Jangerberries, Dwellberries, Red Berries, White Berries, Poison Ivy &amp; more
Level 25 - Calquat Tree
Level 45 - Cactus
Level 53 - Herb Patch
Level 66 - Allotment - Example: Onion, Sweetcorn, Strewberry &amp; more! 
level 76 - Hops - Example : Hammerstone, Asgarnian, wildblood &amp; more!
level 91 - Bittercap mushroom

!! FARMING IS AUTO, NOT A CLICK SKILL LIKE IT WAS !!

All of them need 8 minutes to grow, But all of them have diffrent start timers.
Like: Bush starts at 7min, Calguat at 6:45min, Cactus at 5min. (--&gt; for example).
Each patch the XP will increase alot since I think farming is abit of a pointless skill.
If you are interested, try it yourself !

Pictures farming:

[IMG]http://i57.tinypic.com/ve3jn.png[/img]

Mining:
Mining was like one purple rock, well I&#39;ve made it diffrent!

Copper ore - Level 1.
Iron ore - level 15.
Coal ore - level 30.
Gold ore - level 40.
Mithril ore - level 55.
Adamantite ore - level 70.
Runite ore - level 85.

Like farming, Mining is the same.
Mining is also an auto skill, But there one diffrent.
The &#39;resource&#39; can be depleted by an amount of time (10 seconds - 1minute).
If it&#39;s depleted NONE can mine from the ore.

Mining Place Picture:

Woodcutting &amp; Fletching &amp; Firemaking:

Woodcutting is an easy skill, You just go to a tree and click on the tree, You&#39;ll AUTO chop off some wood from the tree.
One diffrent is there, the tree will regrow with a random timer from 5 seconds up to 55 seconds and the timer is for all the trees the same.
You DONT NEED AN AXE!!!

Level 1: normal tree
Level 30: willow tree
Level 45: Maple tree
Level 75: Yew tree
Level 91: Magic tree

If you go to another tree, You&#39;ll also receive more XP, But each tree has an other regrow timer, like I said before!

Fletching:
You Need a knife for this skill.
You just click: Knife(log) + log(Knife) = Shortbow or Longbow

Theiving used to be the &#39;money making&#39;  in the server.
I&#39;ve changed this into abit more usefull skill.

HOW?
There are two stalls you can use for training other skills (GEM STALL: uncut gems(crafting) and (FISH STALL: raw fish).
Also thieving will give you FASTER raw fish and uncut gems(which is usefull for faster training).

~!! BUTTT !!~
There is a chance that the stall is &#39;empty&#39;. in the mean time cannot take any supplies from the stalls!
SEE PICTURE:

35 -- fur stall
65 -- silk stall
80 -- gem stall
87 -- fish stall
93 -- tea stall (GIVES ALOT MORE XP THAN FISH)

You can get them from the GEM rock (skills location 1)
This require: level 1 mining.

One note: You&#39;ll receive more gems and faster gems from the gem stall than from the gem rock, aswell the gem rock will deplete aswell faster.

First go to skills, ::skill command.</p>
<p>In the north-east corner, there is hanging a rope, just click on it and it will teleport you to AGILITY.</p>
<p><img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/rw6wi1.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>NOW what you all have to do is run the course, SEE THE PICTURES!!!</p>

<p>That is agility.</p>
<p>I HOPE ENJOY IT</p>
<p>Farming:<br>
There are now 7 diffrent paths.</p>
<p>Level 1 Bush - Example: Jangerberries, Dwellberries, Red Berries, White Berries, Poison Ivy &amp; more<br>
Level 25 - Calquat Tree<br>
Level 45 - Cactus<br>
Level 53 - Herb Patch<br>
Level 66 - Allotment - Example: Onion, Sweetcorn, Strewberry &amp; more!<br>
level 76 - Hops - Example : Hammerstone, Asgarnian, wildblood &amp; more!<br>
level 91 - Bittercap mushroom</p>
<p>!! FARMING IS AUTO, NOT A CLICK SKILL LIKE IT WAS !!</p>
<p>All of them need 8 minutes to grow, But all of them have diffrent start timers.<br>
Like: Bush starts at 7min, Calguat at 6:45min, Cactus at 5min. (–&gt; for example).<br>
Each patch the XP will increase alot since I think farming is abit of a pointless skill.<br>
If you are interested, try it yourself !</p>
<p>Pictures farming:<br>

Coal ore - level 30.<br>
Gold ore - level 40.<br>
Mithril ore - level 55.<br>
Adamantite ore - level 70.<br>

<p>Like farming, Mining is the same.<br>
Mining is also an auto skill, But there one diffrent.<br>
The ‘resource’ can be depleted by an amount of time (10 seconds - 1minute).<br>
If it’s depleted NONE can mine from the ore.</p>
<p>Mining Place Picture:<br>

<p>Woodcutting &amp; Fletching &amp; Firemaking:</p>
<p>Woodcutting is an easy skill, You just go to a tree and click on the tree, You’ll AUTO chop off some wood from the tree.<br>
One diffrent is there, the tree will regrow with a random timer from 5 seconds up to 55 seconds and the timer is for all the trees the same.<br>

<p>Level 1: normal tree<br>
Level 30: willow tree<br>
Level 45: Maple tree<br>
Level 75: Yew tree<br>
Level 91: Magic tree</p>
<p>If you go to another tree, You’ll also receive more XP, But each tree has an other regrow timer, like I said before!</p>
<p>Fletching:<br>
You Need a knife for this skill.<br>
You just click: Knife(log) + log(Knife) = Shortbow or Longbow</p>

<p>Now you’ll appear at this location:<br>
<img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/mmq6nt.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Theiving used to be the ‘money making’  in the server.<br>
I’ve changed this into abit more usefull skill.</p>
<p>HOW?<br>
There are two stalls you can use for training other skills (GEM STALL: uncut gems(crafting) and (FISH STALL: raw fish).<br>
Also thieving will give you FASTER raw fish and uncut gems(which is usefull for faster training).</p>
<p>~!! BUTTT !!~<br>
There is a chance that the stall is ‘empty’. in the mean time cannot take any supplies from the stalls!<br>
SEE PICTURE:<br>
<img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/a5hoig.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>THIEVING LEVEL – STALL<br>

35 – fur stall<br>
65 – silk stall<br>
80 – gem stall<br>
87 – fish stall<br>

<p>CRAFTING:</p>
<p>First of all, HOW CAN YOU GET THE GEMSS???</p>
<p>You can get them from the GEM rock (skills location 1)<br>
This require: level 1 mining.<br>
or you can get them by thieving, the gem stall.<br>
This require: level 80 thieving.</p>
<p>One note: You’ll receive more gems and faster gems from the gem stall than from the gem rock, aswell the gem rock will deplete aswell faster.</p>

<p>How do you start??<br>
First off all you need to buy a CHISEL from the skills shop, The skills shop is at any skill location (1, 2 or 3).<br>
It will only cost: 1gp.<br>
<img src="http://i61.tinypic.com/24b8181.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Than you only have to go to the gem rock(loc 1) or go to the gem stall(loc3, req: 80 thieving)<br>
Use the CHISEL on the uncut GEM and it will AUTO UNCUT them all!</p>
