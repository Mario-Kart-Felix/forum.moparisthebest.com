    <title>317, [pi] difficulty problem... continued</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-pi-difficulty-problem-continued/521278</link>
    <description>Alright so me &amp; sk8rdude added the difficulty system to my server, it was a tutorial posted on these forums. Well everything works fine except the xp rates, for around 2-3 hours we looked around for why it was doing this, i still have yet to solve it.

the problem is, when you login your prompted with 3 options through dialogue handler, You may choose rookie, average, legend. no madder which of the 3 you choose your xp rates are the same, for combat &amp; non-combat skills.

i thought well, maybe its in combatassistant.java where i added the rates, nope... player, playerassistant, playerhandler, clicking buttons, nothing seems to show the problem, i get no errors compiling, nor any errors when clicking the buttons. they do save however, if i create a new account, select a difficulty, log out. my character file will have this, [code]Legend = 0
Rookie = 1
Average = 0[/code] now, i chose rookie, so it saved as rookie = 1, so its picking up my clicks. however its not changing the xp rates.

Im using deathlypvpzv4, here is my xp rates.

Located inside playerassistant.java 
[code]public boolean addSkillXP(int amount, int skill){
		if (amount+c.playerXP[skill] &lt; 0 || c.playerXP[skill] &gt; 200000000) {
			if(c.playerXP[skill] &gt; 200000000) {
				c.playerXP[skill] = 200000000;
			}
			return false;
		} else if (c.rookie == 1) {
			amount *= 5;
		} else if (c.average == 1) {
			amount *= 3;
		} else if (c.legend == 1) {
			amount *= 1;
		}
		int oldLevel = getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[skill]);
		c.playerXP[skill] += amount;
		if (oldLevel &lt; getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[skill])) {
			if (c.playerLevel[skill] &lt; c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[skill]) &amp;&amp; skill != 3 &amp;&amp; skill != 5)
				c.playerLevel[skill] = c.getLevelForXP(c.playerXP[skill]);
			levelUp(skill);
			c.gfx100(199);
			requestUpdates();
		}
		setSkillLevel(skill, c.playerLevel[skill], c.playerXP[skill]);
		refreshSkill(skill);
		return true;
	}[/code]

can someone please give me further assistance, as said before i am on a dead-line and i need to fix this whenever possible.</description>
