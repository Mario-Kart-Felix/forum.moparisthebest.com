    <title>A new shield to replace the Dfs?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-new-shield-to-replace-the-dfs/428329</link>
    <description>Hey,
I think it&#39;ll be a drop from the new Qbd/Kq and its pretty obvious it&#39;ll happen as jagex are crashing the value of the Dfs to keep players happy but causing minimal damage as with the release of this new shield the dfs would have crashed like mad anyways.

I have a video which there is a part in the video where I explain the theory behind this but I decided not to post it as I&#39;d not like to be viewed as a hoe for views like hash is lol.

But it is pretty self explanatory, thoughts?</description>

<p>It’s like you’re ignoring the fact he made something worthwhile. What have you made?[/quote]<br>
You don’t need to make something to contribute to society, then again you don’t understand simple concepts. I’ve raised over £10,000(if not more) for charity with of course the lovely people at Shelter and my sister. If you want to argue(as this is no longer a debate) pm me. Also, bots aren’t worthwhile. I’ve used them(if other people have this ability I’m not going to be one of the few without) but I would gladly remove the existence of them as they’ve ruined the game a fair part.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/elve">@elve</a>, that is incorrect. It just means both are slaves to there emotions as they cannot control themselves. But yeah I get the point, I shouldn’t be arguing.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@rp4d</span> Cba pming lol, fair enough.</p>
<p>Anyone got an issue with this post, pm me.</p>

<p>Its like, why is there alcohol? Because consumers want it.[/quote]I honestly don’t even see the point you’re trying to get across. The reason bots were in the game was because of two things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The desire to have an automaton do the work for you. This I know, and you did state it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speljohan. If it weren’t for him, we likely would not have had the RSBot we knew, or possibly even the other bots. If it weren’t for him, there may not have been the chain reaction of other bots’ creations, or at least not for some time afterwards.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s get back on topic now. If you really want to continue this discussion, then pm me.</p>

No, he’s not the reason why they existed was to fulfil the desire to not play the game and to macro.</p>
<p>And just because he is good at Java doesn’t mean he’s smart loool. Just shows at current times by our own standards he’s good at whatever was used to make the bot mostly consisting of Java… It doesn’t make him smart and clearly not wise. In these forums generally speaking there is a fairly decently sized knowledge base but again generally speaking most of the people who posses this knowledge lack basic common sense which is a shame.</p>

Hey,<br>
I think it’ll be a drop from the new Qbd/Kq and its pretty obvious it’ll happen as <span class="bbcode-b">jagex are crashing the value of the Dfs</span> to keep players happy but causing minimal damage as with the release of this new shield the dfs would have crashed like mad anyways.</p>
<p>I have a video which there is a part in the video where I explain the theory behind this but I decided not to post it as I’d not like to be viewed as a hoe for views like hash is lol.</p>
<p>But it is pretty self explanatory, thoughts?<br>
