<p>chaotic shield matching ely? lolno, but that’s just my opinion because if you’re already wearing tank gear (which you should be; bandos is shit), you don’t need a higher defence bonus, you need more damage absorption (or a ddef for accuracy i suppose).</p>
<p>however, if you’re being a dumbass and using bandos, you’re probably better off with a cks than an ely[/quote]<br>
I’m 73 def atm, my main was 82 def(i’ve always been a fan of low defence although defence is good at a high level of course) so defence bonus is always good.<br>
Theres a difference between absorb and defence bonus I think, defence bonus blocks/lowers damage received however absorb just reduces damage received? I’d rather the defence bonus also a cks has crazy def so potentionally its better. Only reason I’d favour a divine over this is because 30% is a crazy ammount and personally I wouldn’t know what to compare it to as i’ve never had or used one outside of a private server.</p>
<p>also bandos is only good for low level pvm, i prefer barrows.</p>

<p>Defence bonus reduces the likelihood of being hit. Absorption is how much damage is taken away when you’re hit. From what I’ve seen, at around 80 defence, a cks becomes a lot less useful. Even before that a dragon defender in conjunction with barrows is a great combo. Although it comes down to preference and personal experience with the two, the math kind of backs it up. I’d post it, but I’m feeling a bit lazy.</p>

<p>Thats nice, but I have a particularly good way of earning money as is <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileyae52.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>Was just curious though cause I thought you meant 1m per hour and I hadn’t seen a bot like that make that much for a while (Leechers using, chinese gold farmers, etc.)</p>

no… it blocks/lowers damage taken. if it only reduced liklihood then you’d only have a variation of its hit aka your hit or your not, not a difference is what damage is given. you need 80 def to wield a cks lol. d defenders are amazing but a cks would tank out a d defender due to its huge defence bonus nevermind including the ability also likewise for the divine and ely. It does come down to preferances, i’ve come to notice a bit of str bonus a lot of defence and attack bonus is the way to go about it.</p>
<p>knowing bandos isn’t good is common sense which a lot of people lack. everyones too omg about the str bonus but are forgetting a key factor, the def is shit. If they care about str bonus imbue a b ring or something.</p>

<p>You have no idea what you’re talking about. They introduced absorption because defence bonus only reduced the chance of being hit. Otherwise absorption would just be another pointless update. Regardless, that was my point. A defence bonus is practically useless by the time you’ve hit 80 defence unless you’re doing some serious PvP/PvM.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I respect your opinion and yourself for realizing that a defence bonus is far more useful than a strength in many scenarios.</p>

<p>[quote=“Kidpaparoach, post:44, topic:428329”]no… it blocks/lowers damage taken. if it only reduced liklihood then you’d only have a variation of its hit aka your hit or your not, not a difference is what damage is given. you need 80 def to wield a cks lol. d defenders are amazing but a cks would tank out a d defender due to its huge defence bonus nevermind including the ability also likewise for the divine and ely. It does come down to preferances, i’ve come to notice a bit of str bonus a lot of defence and attack bonus is the way to go about it.</p>
<p>knowing bandos isn’t good is common sense which a lot of people lack. everyones too omg about the str bonus but are forgetting a key factor, the def is shit. If they care about str bonus imbue a b ring or something.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>You have no idea what you’re talking about. They introduced absorption because defence bonus only reduced the chance of being hit. Otherwise absorption would just be another pointless update. Regardless, that was my point. A defence bonus is practically useless by the time you’ve hit 80 defence unless you’re doing some serious PvP/PvM.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I respect your opinion and yourself for realizing that a defence bonus is far more useful than a strength in many scenarios.[/quote]<br>
‘A defence bonus is practically useless by the time you’ve hit 80 defence unless you’re doing some serious PvP/PvM.’ very bizzare statement, i’m guessing you classify most pvm as serious:L? like personally i wouldn’t classify anything thats not a boss as serious pvm but hey thats just me…(exluding glacors). Defence isn’t my area of expertise, from my accounts you can clearly tell i lean towards the offensive side but defence bonus is important. I don’t need food at waterfiends, but if i never used karils it would ruin the delicate balance and make me need to use food unless i soul splitted.</p>
<p>I’m very skilled at almost everything in Rs:L and that I don’t need acknowledgement of when I do things right because I do literally everything right apart from nowadays I keep confusing my hotkeying while I brid as I don’t pk very much anymore but apart from that my Pvm, skilling, questing and minigames are all done very well. You know you play rs too much when you get like this haha^.</p>

        <p>The only shield that they are planning to make that people know about is the dragon kiteshield, which will have stats proportional to the rest of the kiteshields of other metals, meaning an increase of only 5-10 to each defensive stat (aside from magic).

        <p>They need a bigger variance in armours and weapons I think, generally speaking:/. Like add a lot of weapons/armours with varied stats not just getting stronger and stronger every update. Kindof like what other games do, there items have strong points but bad points.</p>
