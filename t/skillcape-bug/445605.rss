    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skillcape-bug/445605</link>
    <description>After hours of trying to figure out how to add skillcape emotes i finally got it. There seems to be a problem though. When i perform the emote, it seems to have a problem with the height. If anyone has a fix or any idea whats wrong i would appreciate the help. Thanks

as you can see in the picture, the emote is occuring over my head.
