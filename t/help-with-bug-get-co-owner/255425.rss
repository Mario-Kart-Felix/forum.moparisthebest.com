    <description>I need help with a bug that I&#39;ve been trying to fix forever now. The bug on devolution server where you can duplicate when trading. You get 2 of the same item, trade someone and at the same time you put one of the items in the trade window you right click on it before it goes in and click offer one and you now have 3 from 2. IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS TRADE BUG I WILL GIVE YOU CO OWNER. Please I&#39;m begging of you I have to have my server up in 2 hours!</description>

              <p>But the bad thing about timers is that for each different timer, it makes a new thread. So if you have different timers(Barrows degrading, farming, trading, dueling) and you need each instance of Player to be able to be unique to each player(like you don’t want the barrows degrading for one player, and it affecting another players set, if they got the sets at different time), that ends up creating alot of threads, and eventually lag.</p>

see timers fix everything <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> they are really easy to make after you look at the tut and will fix your problem. I am busy atm coding my own server, but i will search for a good tut on timer making and edit this post with it.</p>

I dont know the first line of code to make a timer, and please if you could provide it and atleast give me an idea where to place it I made a new post with the spots to place it I dont know where.
