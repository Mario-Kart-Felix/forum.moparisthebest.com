    <description>Hey guys, in my fight pits, I was having trouble making it say &quot;Attack&quot; after I added in the player shops, I finally made it say &quot;Attack&quot; whenever you right click them in the fight pits, but whenever you click attack, it opens their shop, can someone help me or give me a correct way to make them attack you whenever you press attack?</description>
