Ok had this problem for some time now.

As you see in the picture above a random Barrage GFX is being casted, however nobody is actually casting barrage. As a matter of fact I doubt anyone is even on ancients. This is not the only time the problem occurs, it can occur whenever you are in combat and any random spells-GFX can appear...Any ideas?</description>
