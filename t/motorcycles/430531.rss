    <description>Answer any of the following:

1. What is your favorite motorcycle in terms of performance and design?

2. If you could have any motorcycle in the world, which would you pick?

3. What motorcycle do you currently have?

I personally like the Harley Davidson Sportster, but I do not know what motorcycle I&#39;d get if I could have any.

Post pictures if you like!</description>

I’m currently riding a Ninja 250r, had it for about 2 months, and I’m already wanting something a little bigger. I love the maneuverability of it, its amazing compared to other bikes I have ridden(sv500, gxsr650, sv650). Are there other bikes I might enjoy with more power(I’m not really looking for a monster 1000) but still some wonderful handling?<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>You can’t really take the handling of a 250 to a bigger bike, it’s part of them. If you want something with good handling I’d say an Er-6n. Brilliant looking, fast, great gearbox, excellent handling.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’ve heard they don’t have that much more torque, especially for a 650.</p>

<p>You’ve went through quite a few bikes :P. I wouldn’t mind a 600 Bandit when I pass my bike test. I’d just more or less turn it into a streetfighter. Either that or an XJ-6, they’re also brilliant bikes.</p>

<p>Sadly since I’m only 17 I can’t get any of my R6’s on the road. I have to put up with  a Yamaha R125 for the time being; I love the R6 on the track though, it’s an excellent bike.</p>
<p>I have a few friends who only buy Kawasaki’s for their gearbox. Especially their gearbox in the ER- range, I rode an ER-6n and I was amazed with it. Another great bike.</p>

<p>Once I’m old enough to test drive a bike, I may just check one out. Unless I can get a loan of one at the track or stuff. One of the guys I used to race with had a Triumph and he said he preferred the R6. It’s just personal preference I suppose.</p>

<li>
<p>What is your favorite motorcycle in terms of performance and design?<br>
R6. Best motorcycle in the world in my opinion, I’m a demonstration rider for Yamaha throughout Scotland. Used to race but I had a major crash last year and crushed half of my body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you could have any motorcycle in the world, which would you pick?<br>
R6, I’ve rode R1’s and R125s, but I love the R6 more than any other bike, it’s just amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What motorcycle do you currently have?<br>
I currently have several, however a few I do not own.<br>
I have two 2012 R6’s, owned by Alan Duffus Yamaha, not myself, I use them for demonstration purposes.<br>
I have an R125 which I used to ride on the road since I’m British it was easy for me to pass my CBT, get insurance, tax it and be on the road.<br>
I have a Yz125, but I don’t use it much more, I’m not a big fan of motocross, not even for training purposes. It can be fun at times with other members of my team and stuff.<br>
I also have a Kawasaki ER-6N in orange, which I ride to work and back, to my girlfriends, just anywhere I don’t have to take the car.</p>

I don’t know too much about it, I assume it’s just bush-bashing as we like to call it, on a dirt bike? Look at a KLZ/DRZ/WRF or some other type of off-road bike. I can’t imagine you’d want the balls-to-the-wall feel of a motocross bike, but you probably don’t want the gutless-granny feeling of say a DRZ400. I’d suggest the WRF-450f?</p>
