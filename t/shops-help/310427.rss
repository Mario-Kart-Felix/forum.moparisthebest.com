              <p>lol, there was a tutorial on this flying around here somewhere.</p>
<p>Well… couldn’t find tutorial, but i do know how to. (lol, didn’t want to explain :p)</p>
<p>In the shop configs, the shop number is the first one number you see in the row (up and down), then to the left is the shop name, then is the item id (the item being sold in the fist slot) then the amount you are able to buy at once. then it continues like that. (item id, amount; item id, amount) got that? Now to put your custom item in to the shop you need to put that item id in the item id part, then add how many you want in that shop. If you want to make a new one, well… i can’t exactly remember lol, sorry :p… hope that helped.</p>
