    <title>Need help with Compiling, PLEASE HELP ME!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-compiling-please-help-me/337805</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve posted this in the compiling problem section, yet no one has replied to it with an answer. Any-how, I can&#39;t compile because it says that it cannot find the correct path. It is a 508 source, and I do know that you need a different JDK path, but I don&#39;t know which one, so if someone could PM it to me, or reply to this topic, you&#39;d be doing me a huge favor. Thank-you for reading, and hopefully replying with any answer/ tips.
