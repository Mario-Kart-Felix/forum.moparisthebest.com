    <title>My server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-server/478521</link>
    <description>Okay so i&#39;m modifying this post because when I first posted this, I explained it was my first server which is TRUE, but I also explained IDK how to edit the world yet, which is now false :) I have a pk shop, some new objects throughout the map... Nothing major yet since it&#39;s only been up for 2 days and im the only one working on it but here it is... I made a quick website for it as well so u can see pics, and download.

www.acoldworld.webs.com

It&#39;s pretty cool I guess, i&#39;m having fun with it so far so i&#39;m going to continue to work on it and add to it ill have it online almost all the time besides real late at night because the server is ran on my computer and I don&#39;t plan to leave it running all night...

Thanks!</description>
