    <title>My Server</title>

    <description>So I have a question. How do I get word out about my epic server? I made the advertisement look really good, and that itself normally scares noobs away because they think the server is too good for them to get free staff etc. Also, my VPS went all phsyco last night and now it&#39;s showing 99% uptime. I don&#39;t think anybody will join it, ever. The few people who have joined it loved it and stayed. It&#39;s an PVP server based on cash and stuff. There&#39;s not many people on at a time. Sometimes there&#39;s just me, sometimes theres like seven people. Help me out Moparscape!</description>
