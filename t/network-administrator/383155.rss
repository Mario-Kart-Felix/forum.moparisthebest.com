    <description>I had a few questions that I need answered because I&#39;m a little confused and the IT director at our school hasn&#39;t really helped me out that much.

I&#39;m currently studying to become a network administrator and by the time I get my associates degree I will have taken all of the following classes, along with a few others:

[code]
          BUS-262 Project Management
          BUS-248 Business Communications
          CIS-140 Intro to Microsoft Client O 2011/SP
          CIS-241 Intro to Web Desgn &amp; Mgmt.. 2011/SP 
          CIS-258 Intro to Enterprise Databas
          CIS-260 Data Base
          CIS-295 IT Professional Practice Mg
          CNS-150 Networking Fundamentals
          CNS-151 Network Communication Cabli
          CNS-155 Intro to Routing and Switch
          CNS-170 PC Repair and Maintenance
          CNS-180 Intro to Microsoft Server
          CNS-210 Microsoft Network Managemen
          CNS-220 Advanced Microsoft Server
          CNS-225 Microsoft Enterprise Mgmt
          CNS-230 Information Security
          CNS-240 Open Source Networking
[/code]

Anyways, the question at hand, the one that I am really confused about, is what certification should I be looking to get to help me become more marketable to future employers. I was reading around and I really got a lot of conflicting responses. I was hoping some of the people here could help me out.</description>

<p>So I should get cisco or no…? I mean if you got it through a high school course it doesn’t seem as important.[/quote]</p>
<p>There are different levels of Cisco certification.</p>
<p>I think ultimately it depends what you want to end up administrating. If you were going into a Windows environment, the MS certs would probably be desirable, if you were going into a 100% Unix environment then RHCE or whatever would be useful, etc.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think they’re probably less important than a lot of other things, too.</p>

              <p>It seems so, Newty. It would be better to wait towards the end of your college course, just so that you know what you do and don’t know. Because there are many Cisco qualifications that start from very basic shit like computer systems and you can safely skip them and not be judged negatively by an employer for doing so, if they know their cisco stuff.</p>
<p>The ones you linked to seem to be again, most of the fundamentals, OSI, TCP/IP, etc that you’ll likely be learning on your course so maybe you could try and skip ahead and look for the more specialised qualifications. I wouldn’t personally know where to look for them as I had the course organised for me and was taught it.</p>

<p>There are many, many Cisco qualifications. Like I said, ones that range from some very basic stuff (like the early CCNA modules) to some pretty intense stuff up on CCNP and CCIE.</p>

              <p>Look for Cisco qualifications. You’ll be starting on CCNA and the later exploration courses are pretty good, the early CCNA 1 - 2 discovery courses are a bit of a waste of time for most people who are interested since all they teach are networking fundamentals which you’ll likely already know (Ethernet Encapsulation, etc).</p>
<p>In my experience from knowing people in the industry, looking at jobs in the industry and doing a bit of contract work, Cisco qualifications have been a <span class="bbcode-i">decent</span> thing to have and quite valuable when you get into the CCNP. They do expire every 4 years (or maybe a bit less), though.</p>
