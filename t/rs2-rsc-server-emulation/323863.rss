    <title>RS2+RSC Server Emulation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rs2-rsc-server-emulation/323863</link>
    <description>i remember talking to Speljohan_ awhile ago on irc when we were talking about games, he told me about a game called, ugh forgot now but basically they had a first version, client looked like shit then few years later they made a better one, then after that they made an even better one (full 3d) and all the clients had support to connecting to the 1 server. you could simply pick which type of client you wanted to play on (wheather it be a WoW-like one, or looking like RSC, you could still do pretty much all the  same things, and interact with people on the WoW-like one)

I was thinking about taking the RSCD emu and adding RS2 client support, and slowly adding whatever is possibly  that can visually be shared between the 2 (without looking weird)

there could be a lot of downsides to this, RS2 client has all those other attack properties (stab, slash etc) which i would not implement. the rs2 client would be limited to gameplay.

just an idea</description>

Just a FYI. If you did this, every single rs2 private server player would probably play this.</p>

<p>well the 317 and the 508 HD is actually quite simple. say if you didn’t change the protocol on the 508 client and wanted to get it connected to the 317 server the HD client has a extra byte what tells the server its HD. so if you say logged in with the hd client you get the login method to first check if its HD or if its the 317 client then you send the selected client to the 317 protocol or the 508. but if you changed the 508 client protocol (y) to you</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The whole protocol is randomized between versions, and there are major differences in how interfaces work between the old and new engines.</p>
<p>Again, plugins are used to add support for more client versions, so if I did add support for RSC, the plugin could use different combat code then the RS2 clients, since it is what decodes the packets. I’ll have to take a look at the RSC protocol, but I think this would actually be fun to do.</p>

<p>If you ask for feedback from your players and point out that they have to post a valid reason for their opinion (e.g. disallow posts like “keep it original”), then it’s not ignoring your players. It’s asking your players to defend their opinions/values, and if they fail to do so, you simply don’t count them as “votes”.</p>

<p>A stripped out 508 HD client vs RSC gfx… Would still look awesome.</p>

              <p>Well, if I wrote a server and a client and then created a whole new client, I’d probably keep the server side pretty much the same just out of simplicity. While I never went on a RS2 client and the RSC client at the same time to verify I was indeed on a RS2 world, the friends of mine who were on the RS2 beta world that I joined while on RSC who I PMed said that I was on their RS2 beta world. It was a long time ago and I wish I had studied it more in depth.</p>
