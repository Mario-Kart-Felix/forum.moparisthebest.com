<p>I totally agree with you jme. When I have kids, I’m not even going to buy that kid videogames. I’ll buy him something much simpler. Basketball hoop, football, legos or something. But definitely not computer games or video games. Just a total waste of time. Kids don’t realize this now, but when they start growing up, and find out how poor they are in their social skills, that they won’t even be able to survive in most job environments where you need social skills to get promoted or even just to keep your own job.[/quote]</p>
<p>That’s a bit harsh ron. I’ll buy my kid(s) video games. Just limit the time they are aloud and encourage them to go out with friends.</p>
