    <title>Help with weapon &gt;.&lt;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-weapon/283642</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I am unsure whether this is in the right place, because I don&#39;t know how to fix the problem so I am not sure if it is in my client side or my server side... So if this is in the wrong section, please tell me and I will immediately move it   :)

Anyway, I am using a source a client called PwnScape. When I carry a Godsword, i carry it vertically, not like any other 2H. If someone could tell me where i change it and how i change it, i would really appreciate it... 

Thankyou
