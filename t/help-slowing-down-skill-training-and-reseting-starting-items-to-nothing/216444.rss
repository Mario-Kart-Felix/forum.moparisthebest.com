    <description>ok sorry yall i know these are on the tuts section but i&#39;m having real difficulty with these even with the tuts. what I&#39;m wanting to do is slow down the exp rate of ALL other skills (i was able to do it for att,def,str,range,hp) I need to also change my theiving in game. basically the stalls are right outside the home area and give WAY too much money for my kind of server. I need to change that. and third I need to set the starting items to nothing. Yes I have followed tuts but my server is being stupid and wont even change. can some1 please post back if you have an answer for me. thanks.</description>
