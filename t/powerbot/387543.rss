Does powerbot still steal accounts?<br>
[/quote]<br>
yes it does…when you write the  name and pass they remember it. i just lost my lvl 121 acc to <a href="http://powerbot.org" rel="nofollow noopener">powerbot.org</a>…they are selling it…-.-[/quote]<br>
As I’ve repeated multiple times, don’t talk about what you don’t understand. The bot itself isn’t stealing passwords, it’s the scripts that steal your passwords.</p>

Let me clear this up for you guys;</p>
<p>PowerBot doesn’t steal accounts, it was Arbiters PRO Scripts (Thats why we were never allowed to see the code, it would always be a .jar) that had the malicious content in them, Arbiter and Jacmob were planning to leave about 6 months ago, but their plan took 6 months to put into action, they planned to steal a shitload of accounts, when they heard FT and WILD were coming out, they delayed their movement, and they hacked 10000b worth of stuff.<br>

<p>Isn’t it obvious yet that Paris (ins3) is a liar?</p>

Paris is an idiot, and didn’t know what to do about it.  And the current developers are idiots for continuing to not remove the fucking getPassword() method that any script can access…</p>

And Paris also says in the video “I don’t know how ghost was able to swap the jars out”</p>

<p>Well, each script that I used from him was clean, this includes his FM, Fishing, Cooking, and WC’ing bots. This was before I even thought about the fact that RSBot saves your passwords and scripts would be able to access that. So at the time, I didn’t look.[/quote]Yes they were clean when we first used them, but they update in a way that people cannot see the code, it was very easy for him to change the script.</p>
