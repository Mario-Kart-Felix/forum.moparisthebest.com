    <title>Considering building a new rig</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/considering-building-a-new-rig/421721</link>
    <description>So, my insurance money came in today, and I&#39;m really annoyed by how slowly Skyrim runs on my laptop, so I was considering building a desktop for this place which can run it adequately.
What would you suggest getting, so I can play it on extreme settings without any lag?</description>

              <p>well it really does depend on your budget but i’d recommend an i5 2500k you wont really need anything better and it offers amazing performance for price, a p67 mobo  and you can get about 8gb g-skill ram pretty cheap as for gfx cards and the rest i’m afraid i cant be much help there.</p>
