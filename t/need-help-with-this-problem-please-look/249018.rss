    <description>Well im making my first server and I think I have done everything right but I was wondering if it is necessary if I need to do this step(s).

Now open My Computer, head to C:/Program Files/Java and find the &#39;jre&#39; folder. Copy the folder name and replace &#39;YOURJAVAVERSION&#39; with the folder name. ---- I found the java file but ther are multiple jre folders. Also where am I supposed to paste them?

Click Save As and save it as a batch file.
To save it as a batch file you can either make it end with .bat or clicking &#39;All files&#39; at filetype, and adding &#39;.bat&#39; at the end. 

Also for the part with the variables in chapter 6..
I went to name it classpath but it was already JDKfolder there. Because on the guide it just tells you what to do with JDK 6 update 1 &amp; 2.

I think that is it but once someone answers me and I do what they say I will post other questions if it continues not to work. Thank you for your time and help.
