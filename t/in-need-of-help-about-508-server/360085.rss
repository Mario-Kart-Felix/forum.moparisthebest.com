    <title>In need of help about 508 server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/in-need-of-help-about-508-server/360085</link>
    <description>Hey everyone. I`m actually wanting to add some things to my server which are:

::item command  but  people could only spawn some things and not dclaws, phats and money,... (i don`t know if i have to put if (cmd[0].startsWith(&quot;item 11694&quot;))  p.rights &gt;= 2 for Ags case or something else...) :)

I wanted to add spells such as Energy transfer, heal other, heal group and veng other ( basically just these ) but i don`t even know how to start coding that. :confused:

Add ::1hp command and ::killme or ::die commands. :rolleyes:

::demote which i tried to make following a guide at youtube but DIDN`T work. :(

and last one ::alltome which isn`t working too. :(


I know you all might say ``wow you wan`t too much ...´´ but actually that`s all i need to do so i can get my server the way i wan`t. Anything is accepted, any little help, ANYTHING is really really REALLY apreciated. :D

Thanks, Br.</description>
