    <title>How would I remove members in my server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-remove-members-in-my-server/296875</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a Czar base, and people who have played it, know that it has members.
Its pretty awesome, but all at the same time... I don&#39;t really like it :/
So I was wondering, How I would successfully remove the Members in it?

Thank you very much! :)</description>
