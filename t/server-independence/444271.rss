    <description>[b]The goal is a content system, not one server for all to use[/b]
If we have learned anything from developing and releasing countless well-written, stable, efficient, and relatively content heavy server bases (i.e. Osiris) it is that RSPS hosts are unwilling to adapt to change. It is understood that it is human nature to resist change, so this is not unexpected. The goal is then to develop a solution that will work for those unwilling to submit to changes as large as an entire server base overhaul.

[b]An abstract content machine[/b]
Java proudly boasts the &quot;write/compile once, run anywhere&quot; philosophy. I believe that we can apply the same concept and create a RSPS content machine just like Java has the JVM. This machine would be complete with a [u]complete[/u] and [u]consistent[/u] specification including an API for programming RuneScape content. The machine would then need to be written for (or ported to) all of the popular server bases - rs2d, Hyperion, Apollo, RuneSource, Project Insanity, Deltascape, Osiris, etc. and content can be written once and run anywhere.

Ideally it should be a drop-in JAR file with as minimal code modification as possible. We may need to use java.lang.reflect to hook into the core of a server if it does not hurt performance too much. Remember the goal is to make this as easy as possible.

[b]The API[/b]
The API should be simple yet very powerful. It should be highly event based, but also with player action queuing (to allow for pseudo-completions) and other features that will make developing content more like creative design and less like arm wrestling. As Taharok stated, it should fully support and even recommend the JSR 223 specification.

[b]Package management[/b]
Hell yeah we should write a package manager for the content system. It should be plugin based as well. It should have version checking and automatic updating, with both a CLI interface and a GUI (ugh) as well. I&#39;m not sure how submissions should be moderated if at all, but those are all minor details.</description>

<p>Between Lin, blake, and me, we have a bit of time I think. This is an ongoing project and I don’t think it will be too bad. We’ll see, I guess.</p>
