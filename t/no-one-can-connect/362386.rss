    <description>I know I have posted this but i could not bump it and the people who said they would help me have not been online unfortunately.

Now getting right on with it. My problem is that I change the no-ip from all the .java folders and still can&#39;t get anyone on my server. The main screen starts for them but it say error connecting to server.

This is a 317.

Source I have used : [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,344927.0.html]Homiescape[/url]

Things I have done:


[ol][li]Set up a no-ip account and have made a host.[/li]
[li]Port forwarded.(I think ill give screenies)[/li]
[li]Allowed it through my firewall.[/li]
[li]Changed all of the no-ips in the client and in the source.[/li]
[li]Downloaded no-ip.[/li]
[li]Run the server.[/li]
[li]Run no-ip[/li]
[li]I can connect and none of my mates can.[/li][/ol]

Screenies of my port forwards:

Do I need to do this? Have I done it wrong?

Thanks in advanced  :).</description>
