    <description>Hello, welcome to rezurrection x.
we are a fairly new server with about 8-15 players, who are some of the nicest people I have met over the whole 100 rsps I&#39;ve played.
we are a 317 server mixed with newer elements such as dungeoneering, torva, nex, glacors, gandoermic beasts etc. This means you can play like its a 667 without the rubbish source.
staff spots are slightly open, but only to those who actually deserver it, this server is for the grinders out there, xp is actually hard here and it feels great when you get a 99 in anything. 
we are also unique in the fact that you can prestige here, each skill, when you want. The reward shop is to die for, and leveling here is big business. we have all the bosses you would expect of a 667, and items, in the oldschool feel so come try us out!

something which makes us very very unique as a 317 is we actually have drygores, which don&#39;t look stupid!</description>
