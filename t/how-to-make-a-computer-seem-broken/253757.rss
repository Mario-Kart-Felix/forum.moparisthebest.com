    <title>How to make a computer seem broken?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-computer-seem-broken/253757</link>
    <description>Ok, heres my situation. 

At my work, we have a few computers for sale. Now im not a seller, but i believe i can profit from these computers. 


First Step, make the computers seem broken
Logic being that anyone that knows what there doing can fuck up a computer in 10 seconds. These are computers for sale, and everything is unlocked...

Second Step, fix the computers after everyone sees how fucked they are

Third Step, make them a program that shows the specs of the computer, without anyone but workers able to close it. Thus, making the computer safe, or at least safer, from people trying to fuck it up.


so, how do i achieve step 1, to an extent that i can still reach step 2.
how do i make a computer seem screwed, but so that i can still bring it back.</description>
