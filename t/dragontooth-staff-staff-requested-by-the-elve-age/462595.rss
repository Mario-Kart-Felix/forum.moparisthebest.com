    <title>DragonTooth Staff (Staff requested by The Elve Age)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/dragontooth-staff-staff-requested-by-the-elve-age/462595</link>
    <description>It&#39;s not lightning because I needed to make a staff for my game as well :). However I left it with many options in a game designing way. The staff has a dragon tooth which imbues it with the dragons affix (Fire, Lightning, Ice, Water w/e) Making it stronger in that element :P. So you could have your players kills some yellow dragons for a tooth drop to make this staff or just drop the staff in general. 

I drew a few concepts but I liked this one the most.
Oh yeah btw, I also designed it so it wouldn&#39;t need textures to make it look good :P. Kinda wish people would move on from RSPS but ohwell :).

Sorry about the wait, it has been done for a few days now but I have been flooded with college work this week. Make sure to open the model as a .obj. You will have to resize it to your needs and make a drop model. Other than that it is all ready to go, The download also comes with a couple other concepts I made for it.
