    <description>Hello, I just currently started using 711 files, and I was wondering if anyone if there is a guide on how to give donator rights to players, and how to make custom donator items and a donator zone as well as making any unique map other than that. and how to make npc&#39;s that teleport you to a specific place, or a command. thank you :)</description>
