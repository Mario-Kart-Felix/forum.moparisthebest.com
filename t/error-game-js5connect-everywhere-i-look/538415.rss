    <title>&quot;Error Game Js5connect&quot;.. Everywhere I look</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/error-game-js5connect-everywhere-i-look/538415</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve went through at least 17 servers so far, maybe more. Seventeen just on my history for the day, and every single one has the same common error in the client. &quot;Error Game Js5connect&quot;, I CANNOT AND NEITHER CAN ANYONE WHO HAS HELPED FIGURE THIS OUT! So if someone a lot smarter than I or anyone I have been working with care to help and and possibly take a look, please.. Be my guest.


*EDIT*
ALSO JUST TO KEEP YOU ALL WHO IGNORE PEOPLE WITH &quot;EASY ERRORS&quot;, I have changed the client revision, the IP&#39;s and even the Ports. I setup my environmental tabs just as the Java tutorials explained and everything. Still get the same error.
