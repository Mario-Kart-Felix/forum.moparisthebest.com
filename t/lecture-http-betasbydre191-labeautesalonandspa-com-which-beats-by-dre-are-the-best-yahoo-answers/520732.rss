A government study discovered cold breakfast cereal has been the main source of key vitamins and minerals for National children. But that&#39;s certainly not a good thing. Children could be eating fortified breakfast cereal in place of vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables, that incorporate fiber and cancer-fighting elements, said Amy Subar, a research expert in nutrition with the National Cancer Institute. Her findings were published Tuesday in the October concern of Pediatrics , the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The study shows exactly how little of the meals with naturally-occurring nutrients youngsters are eating, she stated. Kellogg, the world&#39;s leading manufacturer of ready-to-eat cereal, views the study as good reports.  &quot;It really does show the part cereal can play within in delivering critical nutriments in kids&#39; diet programs,&quot; Kellogg spokeswoman Karen Kafer said. Cereal is not necessarily unhealthy, Subar explained. Fortified cereals carry out in fact appear to be on the list of more nutritious meals children are eating. &quot;We merely shouldn&#39;t kid yourself that they&#39;re necessarily receiving all that they need from cereal,&quot;  the lady said. The study of Four,008 children ages Two through 18 viewed 20 foods these people ate between 1990 and 1991. Cereal was the No. 1 method to obtain vitamin A, iron, and folic acid for every age group. Folic acid has been shown to prevent certain types of cancer. Even so, sugary drinks were the No. 2 way to obtain carbohydrates, behind loaf of bread. And high-fat foods like cakes and biscuits ranked among youngsters&#39; top 10 sources of vitamin E, proteins, fiber, calcium, along with iron. Gail Frank, speaker for the American Dietetic Association, said the findings weren&#39;t surprising, but also not necessarily terribly worrisome. No less than, she said, the youngsters weren&#39;t skipping breakfast time or eating high-fat junk food. She said mother and father shouldn&#39;t discourage having cereal, but must encourage their youngsters to have it with berries or a glass associated with juice.Written by Lindsey Tanner  [url=http://betasbydre139.labeautesalonandspa.com/2013/05/29/refurbished-beats-by-dre-monster/]refurbished beats by dre monster[/url]
