    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rsps-social-network-for-your-server-very-nice/427227</link>
    <description>[size=18pt][u][b]Before Reading Further: THIS IS NOT ADVERTISEMENT (Sorry if this is in the wrong section)[/b][/u][/size]

I&#39;ve recently created a Social Network called Cagoi, and i was thinking that well, Social Networks would be perfect for users of a Runescape Private server. Users will be able to Log-In, Register (Log in with Facebook) to get onto it, it can be added to existing forums, and has a nice forums feature. For more of the features and pictures of the Social Network i currently have, read below.

1. Log-In Screen
2. After you Log-in
3. User Profile Customization
4. Events (Posting for Drop Parties)
5. Videos (Sharing Pking Videos)
6. Pictures (Sharing Bank Pics)
7. Groups (Creating Clans)
8. Blog Posts (Guides/Whatever)
9. User Browsing
10. Chat System
11. Private Messaging
12. Password Encryption (Prevents Stolen User-Data)
13. Follow Users
14. Admin Control Panel (ACP)
15. Video Chatting and Group Chatting (VIA tinychat)
16. Virtual Gifts (Credit System)
17. Future Updates
18. What this RSPS Social Network would work best for
19. Requirements/Recommendations
20. Why am i doing this?
21. What i get in return (Not Money)
22. Getting the Social Network 

[size=12pt]1.[/size] Nice sleek Log-in Screen that prevents guests from viewing the site (Can be Enabled or Disabled)
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/1.png[/img]

[size=12pt]2.[/size] This is the screen you get after you log-in to your Social Network, You can post &#39;Status Updates&#39; Pictures, Videos, and more. Makes it an easy way for users to sell stuff to other players on the server because everyone can see everyone&#39;s posts. 
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/2.png[/img]

[size=12pt]3.[/size] Fully Customization of the Profile, re-arrange blocks and add your own HTML to the top of the page (Nice for scrolling Marquees if someone is trying to sell something). You can also add Blog-Post&#39;s, Video&#39;s, Music, Events, And More.
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/3.png[/img] 

[size=12pt]4.[/size] Events, posting Events are good for letting everyone know that you are having a drop party, it will be displayed to everyone, and information on where the drop party is and what time, and also what items are going to be dropped at the drop party!
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/4.png[/img]

[size=12pt]5.[/size] Video Section where everyone can see everyone&#39;s videos that they have posted, very good for sharing pking videos and what not with other users, also good for promo videos and more, you can also sort the videos by different tags that you put on the video, users can also comment on the video if they would like aswell. Now with a rating feature of the videos so users can rate top videos and such.
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/5.png[/img]

[size=12pt]6.[/size] Pictures Section where everyone can share pictures of their banks or other things, once again you can rate pictures, and sort them by tag. Sorry i had to block out names and photo&#39;s in this picture, my user featured in this section wouldn&#39;t have been very happy. 
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/6.png[/img]

[size=12pt]7.[/size] Groups are good for creating clans, the owner of the group can post updates, clan matches, and other stuff from with-in the group. Users can join it in the click of a button, at ease. The owner can choose to let anyone join it or let only people join it after being approved by an administrator of the group, making it very nicely showing who is in the clan with links to their profile. 
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/7.png[/img]

[size=12pt]8.[/size] Blogs are very useful for sharing guides and pretty much anything you can think of to the world, you can post a blog and everyone will be able to see it as they please. Groups can also post blogs, making it easy to make a guide/help section group. 
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/8.png[/img]

[size=12pt]9.[/size] People are able to browse the users that have registered with the social network, add friends, and more. It also shows who is online at the time.
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/9.png[/img]

[size=12pt]10.[/size] Very nice, sleek, and easy to use chat system for your server, where users can chat with each other.
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/10.png[/img]

[size=12pt]11.[/size] Private Messages and email, great for sending messages, pictures, videos, news, and more to other players privately, very clean and organized system. 
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/11.png[/img]

[size=12pt]12.[/size] Passwords are encrypted automatically to MD5 Hash Code what is a long string of numbers that can only be decoded by the server itself, not even the owner can decode this, this prevents any user data getting stolen. 
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/12.png[/img]

[size=12pt]13.[/size] You can now follow people as you would in twitter, kind of like subscribing to their posts, you technically start to follow a group by joining that group aswell.
[IMG]http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/13.png[/img]

[size=12pt]14.[/size] Admin Control Panel, from the ACP you can control the whole Social Network i spent quite a lot of time on this feature, you can install plug-ins, ban users, grant permissions to certain users (Moderator rights, admin rights) so they can monitor the Social Network. Delete Posts, and much much more (Picture coming soon)
Plug-Ins (Currently):

[ul][li]Contact Us Form[/li]
[li]AJAX IM (Chat System)[/li]
[li]Birthday System[/li]
[li]Blogs[/li]
[li]Events[/li]
[li]Facebook Connect[/li]
[li]Groups[/li]
[li]Newsfeed[/li]
[li]Tinychat[/li]
[li]Virtual Gifts[/li]
[li]Photo[/li]
[li]Mailbox (Private Messaging)[/li]
[li]Video[/li]
[li]Notifications[/li]
[li]Forum[/li]
[li]Links[/li]
[li]Friends[/li][/ul]


Everything listed above can be turned on or off at anytime you choose for whatever reason you may have to disable it or enable it. 

[size=12pt]15.[/size] Video Chatting with TinyChat, this is a new feature but it works very well, a few minor glitches (nothing big) but users can enable microphone and video camera&#39;s and chat with others in group video chat. They can also just use chat normally (text chat). I&#39;ll be adding a picture of this later.

[size=12pt]16.[/size] You can now send virtual gifts to people, you can use this as a monetary system. Users can send gifts to groups/player owned shops so say &quot;1 Dragon Platebody&quot; then when the user gives it to the shop, the shop owner will give the user a Dragon Platebody, you can also purchase items using credits. (This is in beta mode and still working a few glitches out)

[size=12pt]17.[/size] Future Updates:

[ul][li]Player owned shops VIA the Social Network, where users can post their items and others can buy them.[/li]
[li]Adding Connections between the server and the social network for various things such as showing how many users are on, what staff members are on, etc.[/li]
[li]Calendar for Clan Match listings[/li]
[li]Calendar that is shared with all users that displays events such as drop parties and more.[/li]
[li][/li]
[li][/li][/ul]


[size=12pt]18.[/size] What this social network will work best for:
This Social Network system is really great for any RSPS. It can hold up to 75,000+ users. I&#39;m only going to be setting it up for servers that are active, and hosted most of the time (to assure my work will be used evenly amongst the users). There are some requirements for this though, see section 19 to find out the requirements and if you can use this.

[size=12pt]19.[/size] Requirements
Data Storage Requirements:

[ul][li]900mb for the Social Network Itself[/li]
[li]In 1 month each user will use about 250kb of data[/li]
[li]Space for Images and Videos[/li]
[li]Space for MySQL/PHP[/li][/ul]


Software Requirements:

[ul][li]MySQL[/li]
[li]PHPMyAdmin[/li]
[li]PHP 5+[/li][/ul]

The above software requirements [b]WILL[/b] use some storage space.

What i would recommend: 

[ul][li]15gb of storage space (this will last you years and years)[/li]
[li]Dedicated Server to host this[/li][/ul]


[size=12pt]20.[/size] Why am i doing this?
After seeing the features and what not i&#39;m sure your probably wondering why i&#39;m offering this, well. I created this to be used as a Social Network kind of like Facebook or MySpace, but i realized how perfect everything on it would be for a Runescape Private Server. I&#39;m fairly decent at coding Java and RSPS but not all that well, i thought it would be nice to give it to someone else and help them with setting it up and using it.

[size=12pt]21.[/size] What i get in return?
There are however a few things i would like, to start i would like to be recognized on the server somehow, whether it be staff rights or something (I&#39;m trustworthy, i just like to help people). Atleast i&#39;m not asking for $300 USD as some other companies have offered me. That&#39;s mainly the only thing, i would just like to be recognized amongst the server (If i like your server i would probably play it anyway). 

[size=12pt]22.[/size] Do you want this RSPS Social Network?
I&#39;d like to thank you for viewing this, just comment below on if your interested and ill private message you and let you know, i will probably ask a few questions, come check out your server, get to know some players, and then if i feel comfortable and confident that my work will be put to good use, ill start. I would also need access to your MSN email or some type of communication that wont take long for you to respond in-case i have an immediate question that i need answered or what you would rather prefer while i&#39;m working. So just leave a comment below and i will let you know. Anyone is free to ask me for it, if your server is dead, i wouldn&#39;t even recommend this. You have seen the pictures and everything, now just decide if you really want this or not!

[size=14pt][b]Please Note: I will be adding more pictures later, if you want a walk through or would like to view the Social Network yourself and use it some, just let me know. [/b][/size]</description>

Google = Search Engine<br>
Rune-Server = Forums<br>
Moparscape = Forums</p>
<p>This = Social Network (Facebook/Myspace)<br>
Implemented with Twitter updates, Blogging, and Forums if you choose.<br>
Users can share pictures, videos, create clans, groups, and more much easier and nicely.</p>

<p>[size=12pt]1.[/size] Nice sleek Log-in Screen that prevents guests from viewing the site (Can be Enabled or Disabled)<br>
<img src="http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/1.png" alt width="507" height="321"></p>
<p>[size=12pt]2.[/size] This is the screen you get after you log-in to your Social Network, You can post ‘Status Updates’ Pictures, Videos, and more. Makes it an easy way for users to sell stuff to other players on the server because everyone can see everyone’s posts.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/2.png" title="2.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/2.png" alt width="690" height="364"><div class="meta">

<p>[size=12pt]12.[/size] Passwords are encrypted automatically to MD5 Hash Code what is a long string of numbers that can only be decoded by the server itself, not even the owner can decode this, this prevents any user data getting stolen.<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/12.png" title="12.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i971.photobucket.com/albums/ae191/venscapepics/12.png" alt width="690" height="404"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>[size=12pt]14.[/size] Admin Control Panel, from the ACP you can control the whole Social Network i spent quite a lot of time on this feature, you can install plug-ins, ban users, grant permissions to certain users (Moderator rights, admin rights) so they can monitor the Social Network. Delete Posts, and much much more (Picture coming soon)<br>
Plug-Ins (Currently):</p>
<p>[ul][li]Contact Us Form[/li]<br>
[li]AJAX IM (Chat System)[/li]<br>
[li]Birthday System[/li]<br>
[li]Blogs[/li]<br>
[li]Events[/li]<br>
[li]Facebook Connect[/li]<br>
[li]Groups[/li]<br>
[li]Newsfeed[/li]<br>
[li]Tinychat[/li]<br>
[li]Virtual Gifts[/li]<br>
[li]Photo[/li]<br>
[li]Mailbox (Private Messaging)[/li]<br>
[li]Video[/li]<br>
[li]Notifications[/li]<br>
[li]Forum[/li]<br>
[li]Links[/li]<br>
[li]Friends[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Everything listed above can be turned on or off at anytime you choose for whatever reason you may have to disable it or enable it.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]15.[/size] Video Chatting with TinyChat, this is a new feature but it works very well, a few minor glitches (nothing big) but users can enable microphone and video camera’s and chat with others in group video chat. They can also just use chat normally (text chat). I’ll be adding a picture of this later.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]16.[/size] You can now send virtual gifts to people, you can use this as a monetary system. Users can send gifts to groups/player owned shops so say “1 Dragon Platebody” then when the user gives it to the shop, the shop owner will give the user a Dragon Platebody, you can also purchase items using credits. (This is in beta mode and still working a few glitches out)</p>
<p>[size=12pt]17.[/size] Future Updates:</p>
<p>[ul][li]Player owned shops VIA the Social Network, where users can post their items and others can buy them.[/li]<br>
[li]Adding Connections between the server and the social network for various things such as showing how many users are on, what staff members are on, etc.[/li]<br>
[li]Calendar for Clan Match listings[/li]<br>
[li]Calendar that is shared with all users that displays events such as drop parties and more.[/li]<br>
[li][/li]<br>
[li][/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[size=12pt]18.[/size] What this social network will work best for:<br>
This Social Network system is really great for any RSPS. It can hold up to 75,000+ users. I’m only going to be setting it up for servers that are active, and hosted most of the time (to assure my work will be used evenly amongst the users). There are some requirements for this though, see section 19 to find out the requirements and if you can use this.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]19.[/size] Requirements<br>
Data Storage Requirements:</p>
<p>[ul][li]900mb for the Social Network Itself[/li]<br>
[li]In 1 month each user will use about 250kb of data[/li]<br>
[li]Space for Images and Videos[/li]<br>
[li]Space for MySQL/PHP[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>Software Requirements:</p>
<p>[ul][li]MySQL[/li]<br>
[li]PHPMyAdmin[/li]<br>
[li]PHP 5+[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>The above software requirements <span class="bbcode-b">WILL</span> use some storage space.</p>
<p>What i would recommend:</p>
<p>[ul][li]15gb of storage space (this will last you years and years)[/li]<br>
[li]Dedicated Server to host this[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>[size=12pt]20.[/size] Why am i doing this?<br>
After seeing the features and what not i’m sure your probably wondering why i’m offering this, well. I created this to be used as a Social Network kind of like Facebook or MySpace, but i realized how perfect everything on it would be for a Runescape Private Server. I’m fairly decent at coding Java and RSPS but not all that well, i thought it would be nice to give it to someone else and help them with setting it up and using it.</p>
<p>[size=12pt]21.[/size] What i get in return?<br>
There are however a few things i would like, to start i would like to be recognized on the server somehow, whether it be staff rights or something (I’m trustworthy, i just like to help people). Atleast i’m not asking for $300 USD as some other companies have offered me. That’s mainly the only thing, i would just like to be recognized amongst the server (If i like your server i would probably play it anyway).</p>
<p>[size=12pt]22.[/size] Do you want this RSPS Social Network?<br>
I’d like to thank you for viewing this, just comment below on if your interested and ill private message you and let you know, i will probably ask a few questions, come check out your server, get to know some players, and then if i feel comfortable and confident that my work will be put to good use, ill start. I would also need access to your MSN email or some type of communication that wont take long for you to respond in-case i have an immediate question that i need answered or what you would rather prefer while i’m working. So just leave a comment below and i will let you know. Anyone is free to ask me for it, if your server is dead, i wouldn’t even recommend this. You have seen the pictures and everything, now just decide if you really want this or not!</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">Please Note: I will be adding more pictures later, if you want a walk through or would like to view the Social Network yourself and use it some, just let me know. </span>[/size]</p>
