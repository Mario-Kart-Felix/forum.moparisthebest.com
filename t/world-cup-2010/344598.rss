Personally I think Argentina will win the competition, Messi and Tevez just know how to play great football.

<p>Holland were benefited by the draw(fixtures).

<p>How many penalties have been given this world cup, how many for off timed tackles? Handballs are rough territory - there’s no ball to hand rule about the game but people can still avoid awarding a freekick or penalty to a team based on a none existant rule.</p>
<p>As for the brazil goal - Did you see how pushed up the defence was, indeed the center backs played wide from each other but you’ve got to think about the midfield intercepting those sort of passes - mainly de jong.[/quote]</p>
<p>Fair enough. De Jong and the Dutch defensive midfield role in general is the only weak link in their midfield I believe although Mark Van Bommel who sometimes helps out in the position is an effective player.</p>
<p>Otherwise, congratulations to Spain. Their individual skill was better than that of the Netherlands in the end. Too bad for the Dutch that Robben couldn’t finish those formidable chances and Spain had quite a few good ones in extra time as well. Iniesta is an amazing player but he really needs to learn to shoot more. As a neutral supporter I really wanted to see a penalty shootout.</p>

<p>Spain were the favourites at the start of the competition and they are still the favourites in my opinion as of current to beat Holland in the final.

<p>They’ve got 5-6 good players in their team. The rest are just regular, every day players.</p>

<p>Yes and those 5-6 good players in their team are in either midfield or attack. Their goalkeeper is ordinary and so is their defence apart from Joris Mathijsen.<br>

<p>5 of those 6 players that you mentioned aren’t in the starting XI…and those 4 defenders are definitely not outstanding. The only reason why they haven’t conceded many goals is that they versed ordinary teams before the quarter finals and their manager has put an organised formation into place.</p>
<p>[quote=“R.I.P RSC, post:83, topic:344598”]Kuyt is an excellent player. He’s great when a back of the opponent attacks a lot. He can run all 90 minutes if he has to.</p>
<p>The keeper is one of the best.[/quote]</p>
<p>Kuyt is an ordinary player who just works hard and Stekelenburg is not much compared to Edwin Van Der Sar.</p>
<p>[quote="Cowie<code>, post:84, topic:344598"][quote author=R.I.P RSC link=topic=440972.msg3263588#msg3263588 date=1278698161] Owowwow Cowie</code> U MAD?</p>
<p>Kuyt is an excellent player. He’s great when a back of the opponent attacks a lot. He can run all 90 minutes if he has to.</p>
<p>The other 5 of the 6 you mentioned are subs, but they are decent too.</p>
<p>The keeper is one of the best. Defence is solid, Heitinga and Mathijsen keep a lot away from the box. Van Bronckhorst never lets down. Van Bommel and De Jong own the midfield, and Robben, Sneijder and Van Persie score when they have to. Although Van Persie underperformed up till now.</p>
<p>But to be honest I think that Spain will win.<br>
[/quote]<br>
Defence is quite good to be fair, I don’t get how you can drop Holland for their defence when all of the defenders they have commit 100%, they play well with each other and fill in for players out of position covering each other.[/quote]</p>
<p>How can you say that their defence is so good when Brazil sliced their defence in half through a single pass from the halfway line, resulting in a goal to Robinho. To add to that is Uruguay’s set piece at the end of the semi final which also resulted in a goal due to Holland’s openness and unawareness in defence.</p>

<p>Kuyt is an excellent player. He’s great when a back of the opponent attacks a lot. He can run all 90 minutes if he has to.</p>
<p>The other 5 of the 6 you mentioned are subs, but they are decent too.</p>
<p>The keeper is one of the best. Defence is solid, Heitinga and Mathijsen keep a lot away from the box. Van Bronckhorst never lets down. Van Bommel and De Jong own the midfield, and Robben, Sneijder and Van Persie score when they have to. Although Van Persie underperformed up till now.</p>
<p>But to be honest I think that Spain will win.[/quote]</p>
<p>Kuyt may have heart but the position he plays doesn’t really suit the way he plays, or the type of player he is.<br>
The other 5 may be substitutes but it doesn’t change the fact they’re poor even at club standard.</p>
<p>Your Keeper isn’t great, he’s better than some of the keeprs we’ve seen this world cup but still.<br>
Defence is quite good to be fair, I don’t get how you can drop Holland for their defence when all of the defenders they have commit 100%, they play well with each other and fill in for players out of position covering each other.</p>
<p>Holding mid fielders dont suit holland either, you’re too offensive - your formation and how you play the ball out wide and let your wider players cut in shows that.</p>
