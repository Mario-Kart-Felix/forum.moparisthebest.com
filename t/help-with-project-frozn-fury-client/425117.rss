    <title>Help With Project Frozn Fury Client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-project-frozn-fury-client/425117</link>
    <description>Hey everyone I saw this tutorial http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-client/tutorials/253018-how-make-your-project-insanity-client-webclient.html and it said I could setup my client so I could jar it and make it a webclient. So I did everything right and I jarred it. But when I run the jar file nothing shows up. So if anyone can help me or referr me to a tutorial to help that would be great because nothing in the client was ready to be jarred for a webclient.

Thanks for reading.</description>
