    <title>Can not log onto any servers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-not-log-onto-any-servers/377978</link>
    <description>Ok, so first time user of Moparscape.
I tried, and failed, at setting my own private server up for my own use, and it has not worked.
So, I&#39;ve tried using the servers listed on this site&#39;s server checklist or whatever.  Nothing works.  Just says I&#39;m logged in already, try another name.  I have the downloaded client.

EDIT: The ONLY time I&#39;ve been able to run a private runescape client was with moparscapes new beta 4.1 version.  Only thing, I can&#39;t add any items to that server.  I&#39;m really confused as to why I can&#39;t seem to log onto any server I find.  At all.  PLEASE help.</description>
