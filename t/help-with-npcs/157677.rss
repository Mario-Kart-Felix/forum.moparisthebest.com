    <title>Help with NPCs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-npcs/157677</link>
    <description>Hey, I am working on my server (based off TestScape), and have run across two different problems with NPCs:

1) I need some NPCs to face a certain direction when they are initially made spawned. (from autospawn.cfg)

2) I have gotten Jad to work very well, with the correct animations and even randomly doing mage, range, and mellee attacks... However while fighting him, he has 124/124 hp (should be 180 based on npc.cfg) and then once that is depleted, it goes back up to something like 260/124.  Server-side debugging shows that his HP is correctly kept the whole time their, but it just will not display on the client.

Oh, and one more thing that I just can not figure out.  I have a portal leading to a pk area, however when one person is already their, and then another comes, the player who was already their cannot see the other player without leaving and coming back.</description>
