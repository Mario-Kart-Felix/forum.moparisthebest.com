    <title>Quantum Mechanics, M Theory, and Bending Reality</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/quantum-mechanics-m-theory-and-bending-reality/509590</link>
    <description>Just an idea I had while driving home from work today. The M Theory states that basically everything in existence is the result of the vibrations of a bunch of super strings (the strings make up quantum particles, which make up sub-atomic particles, which make up atoms, which make up molecules, etc). We also know that (from our current understanding of physics) that matter cannot be created or destroyed.

So the idea I had is this. What if instead of creating, or destroying matter or energy, you change the way the strings vibrate, thus causing a ripple effect, changing the quantum particle behavior, changing the sub-atomic particles, atoms, molecules, etc. Now I&#39;m not a physicist, or know a lot about quantum mechanics, but I&#39;d like to get some input from people who may have a better understanding than I.</description>

<p>Bend reality. Not saying I would, because if someone had that ability, it would be an immense amount of power, far too much power for anyone, or anything to have. Someone (if it were possible) with nefarious intentions, could replace all of the oxygen on the planet with nitrogen, or anything else I suppose. I know it seems more like a fantasy situation, but from the way I’m thinking of it, it could be very much possible.</p>

<p>Why not? I know that we can’t as of now, and we may never be able to. But my understanding is that we can affect the vibrations, and subsequently, the vibrations can affect us. We can burn a log in a fire. We take those particles of matter (and subsequently, the strings that make them up), and turn them into particles of heat energy, light energy, and a bit less matter. And the strings already affect reality. My question isn’t if we can do it effortlessly, but rather, would it be possible?<br>

Its not actually any less matter, all of the matter that the burned log had is now ash, remember that there is alot of lose space in that log, and with the right amount of force can be smashed to smaller pieces. I know nothing about the general topic, just thought I would give some truth on ‘less’ matter. Remember, matter cannot be created nor destroyed, but you can change its form. Thus, the burning of a log into ash.[/quote]</p>
<p>Yes, when I said “less matter” I meant that it took up less space (tree trunk burned into a pile of ash).</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bowser">@Bowser</a>: Yes, currently we can only change the string vibration from the normal interactions we have with nature. I should have been more clear in my initial post. Currently, we can’t manipulate the strings as easily as macro objects, but then again, we have a very superficial understanding of quantum mechanics.</p>
