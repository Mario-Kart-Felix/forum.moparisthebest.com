    <title>TitanPK 562/668+</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/titanpk-562-668/420556</link>
    <description>This server is a 562/668 at the moment and I update every time that Runescape comes out with something awesome. (Currently updating to the Dominion tower revision once method fixes his cache downloader)

The server is currently in the BETA stage and is not in full release at the moment (this is the reason I am not advertising on the status lists yet :P)

The current forum is at [url=http://titanpk.site40.net]http://titanpk.site40.net[/url] if you want to get involved in our small community and stay updated on how the server is coming along.

Update Log
[code]
November 4th -- Added mage bank god capes (same as RS appearing in a poof of smoke in front of you)

Pre-November 4th -- Everything I have so far.

<p>Haha. I love how you guys think I am a professional programmer <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Am I really THAT good? Cause I really don’t remember saying that I was a professional programmer in any way lol. The only thing that I have said is that I am in a programming college right now which is not a lie.</p>
<p>I am far from professional to be completely honest. That is the reason I am using RS2HD’s networking.</p>
<p>Just as a side note to that faggot who said that my claw formula is messed up:</p>
<p>1: I do not have x10 hits in my server as they are probably the most hated update ever added to Runescape except the GE.<br>
2: I have been using the same claw formula that is in every goddamn server you see so I know it is correct…</p>
<p>Lastly, to the one who said that I have only used tutorials and Dkk’s cache packer for my server:</p>
<p>I laughed when you said this as I have never seen another 562 (Pvp combat exception of RuneEscape) with:</p>
<p>1: Attack style bonuses affecting hits in both PVP/PVM<br>
2: Defence level and Bonuses affecting the chance of monsters hitting you<br>
3: Attack level and Bonuses in the NPC definitions that affect their chances of hitting you depending what armour you are wearing.<br>
4: 100% notes<br>
5: String input packet correctly set up and working</p>
<p>So as you can see, I have used MINIMAL tutorials/snippets except for the occasional packet release or client sided functionality like Emily’s custom loyalty title tutorial.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, you should try logging into my server and AT LEAST look at all the features before flaming me.</p>

<p>What fucking thread did you read? If you’re programming in college please do tell me, if you’re majoring in computer science.

<p>And btw, I am 16 lol… Junior in high school. I have 4 classes at the high school and then a 3 hour class at DigiPen college where we are learning VIDEO GAME programming. Not schedule shit. It is still only in the basics and we are working on our own physics engines right now (I am never going to be a physics programmer lol. I hate it). If my final project is the best in the class, I can get a scholarship to DigiPen where they will pay for my first semester (not much but it saves me 50 grand lol)[/quote]</p>
<p>Video game programming? What the fuck is that, you mean you’re in Computer Science learning the basics of computer languages? That let’s me know you’re lying.  In my AP Computer Science I took in 10th grade, we at least learned the basics functions of operating systems so we could program in windows &amp; osx architectural structure. We also learned C# &amp; C++ within the first 2 months, so what is “video game programming”?</p>

<p>And they are teaching programming logic rofl. You have to remember, it is not the goddamn college course, it is an A.P. course. I find it hilarious that you are flaming me for being young.</p>

<p>What fucking thread did you read? If you’re programming in college please do tell me, if you’re majoring in computer science. How would you map a schools accounts and manage their payments/payments owned, also be sure to include their schedules. Pretty basic project you’d get in a computer science course.</p>

No one except someone who is certainly missing part of their brain will give you good feedback, and when they do it will be like “Omg y is uso pro at codez.” or some stupid shit. If your going to be a dick, at least be good at the shit your doing. Because atm, all youve shown that you can do download some utilities, and follow the instructions or just copy and paste a tutorial.</p>
<p>Also, your source is going to suck too. You used a Caelum based 562 obviously, enjoy the shitty source.</p>

Oh I’m sorry. I heard a fly buzzing in my ear. It sounded like the owner of a server that has the shittiest combat I have seen for a very long time.</p>
<p>No NPC defence/attack level/bonuses affect combat hits<br>
No Player defence/attack level/bonuses affect combat hits</p>
<p>^^Both of those for PVP and PVM</p>
<p>So basically, you have nothing to say rofl. I find it hilarious that you even posted in this thread.<br>

im telling u got a great server here and ur beign an asshole wow…[/quote]</p>
<p>Just don’t bother with this guy lawl… If you go on r-l, he acts like he’s some professional programmer, but look at his server… it’s shit… and my friends told me when they was playing it that the claws hit was something like 0, 40, 20, 60… on x10 hp… l2write formulas bro…</p>

              <p>Oh I’m sorry. I heard a fly buzzing in my ear. It sounded like the owner of a server that has the shittiest combat I have seen for a very long time.</p>
<p>No NPC defence/attack level/bonuses affect combat hits<br>
No Player defence/attack level/bonuses affect combat hits</p>
<p>^^Both of those for PVP and PVM</p>
<p>So basically, you have nothing to say rofl. I find it hilarious that you even posted in this thread.</p>

              <p>This server is a 562/668 at the moment and I update every time that Runescape comes out with something awesome. (Currently updating to the Dominion tower revision once method fixes his cache downloader)</p>
<p>The server is currently in the BETA stage and is not in full release at the moment (this is the reason I am not advertising on the status lists yet :P)</p>
<p>The current forum is at <a href="http://titanpk.site40.net" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://titanpk.site40.net</a> if you want to get involved in our small community and stay updated on how the server is coming along.</p>
<p>Update Log</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">November 4th -- Added mage bank god capes (same as RS appearing in a poof of smoke in front of you)

Pre-November 4th -- Everything I have so far.</code></pre>
