    <description>lol ok now for my christmas event i wanted to do something almost completely orignial, had never been done b4 on a private server. so FROM SCRATCH i made 3 (well 4 really) spongebob characters for my christmas event. i ran out of time and didn&#39;t give them christmas hats =( but here they are anyway: o yeah 1 last thing, also note that patrick and squidward were very rushed to get them ready for the christmas even due to the fact that i had a dud datmaker and didnt think my models worked -.- anyway here, yes i am well awhare that the mouths aren&#39;t that good and i could do a lot better =) lol:

SPONGEBOB: (please note that this was my 1st model ever using meta lol, yes i no its alittle rough lol. ps. i didnt finish his pants.)

note: this was a very fun event =) even tho it only takes like 5 minutes lol, you get a few more customs from it (not just bary) lol but is now over =( will be making more customs for easter event. wont be as rushed and probs look awesomer lol.

yeah there alittle rough lol but here&#39;s my latest one for the easter event, used the old ones nose and arms coz didnt wanna re-do them:

</aside>
<p>yeah took me awhile, is a lot better then the first one, yes i dont believe u have any reason to doubt the poly overkill. howeva even the first crappy one i made never worked -.- so yeah idk its like jnyxed lol i know it’s big but i made some little 2d crappy thing around the same size and that works lol. the old one i made was 2d and that never worked either, and i ended up making that the size of a dagger i think. anyway yeah it just wont work lol. i believe this one has too many polys, it has arounnd 400 so yeah… i think that’s alittle too much for a sword? but yeah looks kool lol, would be awesome to have ingame. also if you do that patrick thing that’d be kool.</p>
<p>o yeah chaos,i didnt have time too give him pants and he was the 1st thing i made using meta. i worked out how to use most of the program by making him… anyway yeah the easter spongebob one is the latest one i’ve made, he has clothes so yeah lol.</p>
<p>edit: nvm i got reaper’s blade of pain working, and then made it ridiclously big xD looks awesome lol.</p>

<p>o kk, didnt no u could say fuck lol.</p>
<p>also yeah atm i actually have no idea wat mental wire framing is lol, so yeah, i have planty of time, unforunately i dont no anything about making the anim either so i havent done that, they just look kool ingame lol. but yeah if you could help with with that, it’d be awesome.</p>
<p>edit: i think i may no now that i think about it… is it just like the 3d wire of him?<br>
o also tell me wat you think of the latest sword i made, it’s an old one that i re-did, took me awhile, looks awesome, its a sword off Naruto, one of my players named it with “reaper’s blade of pain” here’s a few pics:</p>

<p>there’s just one problem with it atm, no matter what i do, i’ve never been able to get this sword too work, it always turns the player invisible lol -.-… it’s meant to be held like a dh greateaxe. o also please note the blade isn’t 2d… its just not very thick, i think its about 2mm… i might may it abit bigger lol.</p>

<p>also… to the noob who recons he’s just a gifted modeler and recons he’s 1st model was just awesome. go to hell, you noobs think your so good by putting other modelers down… god wat kind of a tool are u… u seriously have no respect or honor or even desoncy(cant spell but sound it out…) to other people who want to have a go, well f**k you buddy, u dont even give people a chance, these were the 1st things i ever made and they dont look half bad in game, i would consider them pretty lame to the stuff i can make now and this is a very old topic so maybe if u stop posting in it it’ll bloody die already so it isnt grave digged seriously wtf is wrong with u, i check this topic like every few weeks to see where it is, if theres a post i’ll reply to it, icbf checking when that post was i just do, anyway gtfo off my topic if your just gonna flame u stupid noob.</p>
<p>not that im really doing it but READ THE BLOODY RULES, there is no actual rule on this forum about grave digging… howeva it does say something about flaming and stuff… not that im doing it but even if i was… it’s not againest the rules so stfu.</p>
