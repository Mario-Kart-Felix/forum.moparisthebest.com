    <description>Hey, this is the second time my computer crashed and i got it fixed and both reasons was from trying to create a private server, i pretty much got it created and all and like well it crashed this time because i think its from playing with environment variables too much idk or its cause firewall was off, but would everyone tell me the suggestions of a safe way to create/host a private server to prevent crashes?</description>
