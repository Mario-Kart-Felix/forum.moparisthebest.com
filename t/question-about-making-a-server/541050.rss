    <title>Question about making a server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/question-about-making-a-server/541050</link>
    <description>I have looked at about 10 tuts on how to make a server. Every one tells you to do the same thing. Get no-ip and then port forward. But they dont tell you what to do after that. I downloaded no-ip and i did the steps for that. I also port forwarded now i just need to know what to do now? any help please?</description>

First off, it’s garbage, I don’t know why Fox keeps releasing them because he says “All bugs fixed” and then I login and there is 300 more bugs to patch from his last “update”.<br>
Second, you want to change the IP Address <span class="bbcode-b">Client sided</span>. I believe it’s either in Loader.java or some ClientSettings.java file.<br>
It should say “127.0.0.1” (with quotes) you’re going to want to change it based on who will be using the client. If it’s people that are not on your local network, you want the IP to be your no-ip (if that’s what you’re using and the no-ip DUC client is running). If they are on the same network as you, you want your local ip, it’s found in your network and settings center (or similar), usually is 192.168.xxx.xxx. If it’s you, playing on the same computer as the server is being hosted from, keep it at 127.0.0.1, or localhost.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Thanks for the help! For some reason I couldnt get my no ip to work… I tried the number ip and the client wouldnt load… then I tried the host name and that didnt work so right now im just useing hamachi. Intell I find a way to use like a vps or a dedicated server[/quote]<br>
Make sure your router is portforwarded on port 43594, and that the ip that is ported is equal to the one you’re hosting your computer on. Some routers will renew your ip address every week or so, so it’s smart to make your local-ip static.<br>
Use <a href="http://canyouseeme.org" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this website</a> to check if you properly port forwarded <span class="bbcode-u">after</span> your server is up and running.<br>
Some other links that may be of help:<br>
<a href="http://portforward.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://portforward.com/</a> Should have all guides to port forwarding<br>
<a href="http://www.simpleportforwarding.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.simpleportforwarding.com/</a> A simple to use port forwarding tool (I used to use this)<br>
