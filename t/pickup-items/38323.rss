    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pickup-items/38323</link>
    <description>is there a limit on how many items you can pick up because after a little while of getting items my guy freezes and logs out and every time i log in after that it just freezes and logs me back out. so thats my first question and my second, do you have to download anything besides moparscape 3.2/aryan?</description>
