    <title>Show-Off Board Vote</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/show-off-board-vote/403519</link>
    <description>This thread is to see what our community truly wants, 

Are you with or against a Show-Off board where you can show off anything you would like to basicly show off.

(Not RuneScape related though.)

Examples:

- A new videogame you made.
- A new expensive watch you&#39;ve bought.
- A new spoiler you&#39;ve putted on your car.
- Something you made with Photoshop.
- Your new laptop.
- A special skill you have.
- Your new dog.
- And basicly anything that&#39;s capable of being showed off.</description>

<p>This is very true. The only graphics needed with a rsps would be logos and shit like that.</p>

<p>You will not be treated like a fucktard on mitb as long as you don’t act like a fucktard.  Perfect example: When Frell started posting on mitb he was raped repetitively by other members for being a moron. After taking a few moments and cutting the shit frell is now a semi respected member on both boards. Of course he will always be remembered as a Fox news slag.[/b]</p>

So hey, let’s create a ‘Spam’ board, we can keep it there, but if people spam it’s easy to delete <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I’ve never seen MITB do ‘trial’ stuff, why go through the effort for no reason?</p>
<p>Honestly, can you give me examples as to what would be posted here (and why they couldn’t go in general discussion)<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">besides graphics though, because like I said I agree with a graphics section</span><br>
[/quote]I recently bought a mechanic Armani watch, cost me 560 dollars, that’s something I would like to put there.<br>
Soon my new game will be finished, I would like to post it in a Show-Off board, some guy found a dog, he would like to show it to us. I tuned my car, I’d like to show it off in the show off board. Some guy upgraded his laptop and recently did a world wide performance compare (there’s a program) and he’d like to share his stats. Some guy learned how to fly, he’d like to show pictures of him flying and asking people how he could imrpove his flying technique.</p>
<p>I have many more.</p>
<p>A show-off board would give people the chance to show off their talent, and other people could give him feedback on how to improve or tell him how awesome he is.</p>
<p>A show-off board gives people the chance to show people what makes them special.[/quote]</p>
<p>This doesn’t come under General why?</p>

              <p>[quote=“Davidi2, post:77, topic:403519”]So hey, let’s create a ‘Spam’ board, we can keep it there, but if people spam it’s easy to delete <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>I’ve never seen MITB do ‘trial’ stuff, why go through the effort for no reason?</p>
<p>Honestly, can you give me examples as to what would be posted here (and why they couldn’t go in general discussion)<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">besides graphics though, because like I said I agree with a graphics section</span>[/quote]I recently bought a mechanic Armani watch, cost me 560 dollars, that’s something I would like to put there.<br>
Soon my new game will be finished, I would like to post it in a Show-Off board, some guy found a dog, he would like to show it to us. I tuned my car, I’d like to show it off in the show off board. Some guy upgraded his laptop and recently did a world wide performance compare (there’s a program) and he’d like to share his stats. Some guy learned how to fly, he’d like to show pictures of him flying and asking people how he could imrpove his flying technique.</p>
<p>I have many more.</p>
<p>A show-off board would give people the chance to show off their talent, and other people could give him feedback on how to improve or tell him how awesome he is.</p>
<p>A show-off board gives people the chance to show people what makes them special.</p>
