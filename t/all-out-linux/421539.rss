    <description>Until now I have duel booted ubuntu with windows7 but as more and more errors piled up with windows 7 I have decided to go with Ubuntu as my main operating system (windows xp will run in a virtual computer when I need it). So this topic is really to discuss Ubuntu more in depth with the community, we all talk about how linux is awesome, but what are the pro&#39;s and cons? What could make someone want to make the switch? (:</description>

<blockquote>Arch Linux is an independently developed, i686/x86-64 general purpose GNU/Linux distribution versatile enough to suit any role. Development focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Arch is installed as a minimal base system, configured by the user upon which their own ideal environment is assembled by installing only what is required or desired for their unique purposes. GUI configuration utilities are not officially provided, and most system configuration is performed from the shell by editing simple text files. Based on a rolling-release model, Arch strives to stay bleeding edge, and typically offers the latest stable versions of most software.</blockquote>
