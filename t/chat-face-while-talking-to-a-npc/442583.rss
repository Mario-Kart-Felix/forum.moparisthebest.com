    <title>Chat face while talking to a npc</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chat-face-while-talking-to-a-npc/442583</link>
    <description>When I&#39;m talking to a npc, the chat box appears and shows what they say. The problem is that as they talk, one part of their talking motion makes the face glitchy and half disappear. As he talks his face is all glitched up for 1 second every almost 3 second.</description>
