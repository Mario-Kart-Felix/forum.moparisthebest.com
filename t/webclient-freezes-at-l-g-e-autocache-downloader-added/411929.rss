    <title>-Webclient Freezes At L.G.E, Autocache Downloader Added-</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/webclient-freezes-at-l-g-e-autocache-downloader-added/411929</link>
    <description>So i jar and signed my client.
Everything (client.jar) works fine on my desktop, starts downloading cache.. runs fine.
When i uploaded it to my host it starts the java, than gets stuck on the client: Loading Game Engine.

Just sits there, if i go away from the page it goes white.
I had a webclient working fine but over 60+ players i&#39;d say quit because they couldn&#39;t download or didn&#39;t like too.

Can somebody please help me on this error?
