    <description>[size=16pt]Welcome to Project-Relapse 317![/size]
We are a brand new Private Server looking to start a community. Project-Relapse has been Offline in development for the past couple months now, and ive finally decided i want to start hosting it today. Keep in mind we are a brand new server so, not everything will be perfect &amp; everything. you know? But what i can assure you is that if there are any bugs/glitches found, they will be fixed ASAP. No questions asked. Also since we are still new, i can almost garantee you there will be updates daily to improve the server &amp; hopefully grow! But you prolly dont want to read an entire page.. so im just going to cut to the point. I Hope to see you in-game!
Thanks for reading!!
