    <title>Enkrona 3.2 - Solved Please Del</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/enkrona-3-2-solved-please-del/554809</link>
    <description>Hello girls and guys, first off all I wanna say Hi! this is my first post ever on moparscape forums.

As we speak, I&#39;m currently looking for Enkrona 3.2 source. 
The reason why I want it is because I want to bring back some childhood memories when my PC still had 2.4ghz single core.
I might put it online, without donations or anything.. just for public use without getting something back.

Who can help me out? 

Thanks in advance.

Delano - Slaughterhouse, sorry for my bad English.
