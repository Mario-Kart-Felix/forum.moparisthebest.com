    <title>Questions about Moparscape in general</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/questions-about-moparscape-in-general/402384</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve played a lot of runescape in the past. Started in Decemeber of 2005 and played for about 3 1/2 years. Stopped after getting mysteriously hacked and moved onto Xbox 360 platform. So just recently I was told about moparscape.

How exactly did this come into existance? I&#39;m very curious. Like maybe a historical background or something.

Thanks.</description>

<p>Thanks man. But what about legalities? How can they still have a game that looks just like runescape and not get sued?</p>

<p>Well, the point of this was to be a learning experience who wanted any coding experience in Java, or maybe wanted to test a SCAR script safely. Now the whole system is rigged up with people who download the same source over and over, edit the name so it’s “theirs”, and ask for donations from people, where the “VPS” they had running will “break” but they still have your money. Every now and then you’ll find a bit of light in this shithole, but that is quickly leeched and destroyed.</p>

              <p>This has little information about it, but still a little useful:</p>
<p>Moparisthebest’s About-Me:</p>
<blockquote>I started playing Runescape in December of 2004, I started cheating on Runescape around January of 05 when i found a site with SCAR scripts on it from google, www.rstools.prv.pl, I downloaded chrizs ironminerbanker from there and I was off cheating. Reading that script is how I learned to write scripts. Then in April my mostly legit main got banned because I messed up one line on my second script ever, an autofletcher. I then took a break from runescape, only to come back a few months later in July to find my first cheating community, sythe.org, after posting there a while, I came across a link to kaitnieks.com. I knew the name kaitnieks as the creator of SCAR, so I figured I would check it out, all of the people there including kaitnieks himself were so nice and friendly I just stayed. Since then I have learned many many things, posted a few SCAR scripts people still use and spammed the forums quite well. When winterlove released his private server publicly I wrote a client for it as basically my first attempt at client modifing, well it stuck and everyone started using it. After that I worked on another project, MoparScape Revolution, a pking/SCARable client that was autoupdating and incorporated all of the features I liked to give us cheaters an unfair advantage against legit players in the game. Over the years I have written various small tools, games, and frameworks. One of the ones that I like the best, is a project called Cherokee, which can be found with the full source on sourceforge.net by checking it out with SVN. Though it is not a full fledged bot, it does not lack much from being one, and can be a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in runescape cheating. Since then most of my time has been taken up with college, and courting Ashton up to our recent marriage. I have had time to release a few more private server versions of MoparScape, and soon another will be forthcoming.</blockquote>
