    <title>Netgear Portforwarding problem (With pics)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/netgear-portforwarding-problem-with-pics/187530</link>
    <description>Ok, well, to start off. My computer has a very bad virus on it called the MonaRonaDona Virus and was the main computer in the house.(I am currently using my moms that feeds off mine.) I had to go get my computer fixed today but sadly Bestbuy is closed do to the weather. So, my mom doesn&#39;t use a router, she uses a wirless link-up in the back of her computer that goes from mine to hers, etc...

Well, I figured out how to host on mine. I could actually host other people.  But my moms computer is a little different. But, I have portforwarded(pic below)

 Installed Moparscape with Aryan. I also have no-ip DUC and have enabled my DUC IP:

              <p>Honestly man. Idk what’s wrong. Maybe you can’t host of wirless internet. Considering mine is getting repaired and it was the host. I’m pretty sure everything is right tbh. but Idk why it isn’t working.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 08, 2008, 06:47:32 PM[/size][hr]I guess nobody knows or apparently doesn’t care…</p>
