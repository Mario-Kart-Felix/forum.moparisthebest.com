    <title>My thirst for knowledge</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-thirst-for-knowledge/369217</link>
    <description>The title says it all, I&#39;m wondering how each of you learned to program and hopefully debate on the best road to travel for me, I&#39;m truly hoping that by posting this and you all replying that I will find the best way for me to learn.

So, How did each of you learn, and what would you consider the best way (outside of a classroom)</description>

<p>If you aren’t willing to take the advice of the members of this forum, however crudely it is presented, then I don’t see why you seek intellectual refuge here. It’s just a forum about Java. You could have asked your question, then been on your way, rather than sitting and poking fights at every person that posts on this topic.</p>
<p>But yeah, nothing good can come from this topic anymore.</p>

Fuck off. Pulling rank doesn’t work unless you have rank to pull. That doesn’t matter though, because only idiots have to resort to pulling rank in the first place anyway. By rank I mean age, obviously.</p>
<p>Having read some of your previous posts, I know that you’re apparently 18 (having made a post in 2008 stating that you were 16). Your attempt at witty rhetoric was less impressive than that of a smart arsed primary school student.<br>
With that in mind, I can safely say that you aren’t actually 18. If you are 18 physically then you’ve got a long way to go mentally.<br>
Don’t have a whinge because a couple of forthcoming people were kind enough to tell you what’s what when it comes to succeeding or failing at something.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of people at the end of the day – haves, and have-nots.</p>
<p>The haves don’t even need to make topics like this; they’re driven enough to read the resource list topic, find an ebook, and then run with it. Two months later they’re programming like a natural. They may or may not then start asking structured questions with regards to the finer nuances of what they’ve applied themselves to; everyone here welcomes that.</p>
<p>The have-nots are like you; undriven, unmotivated, incapable of directing their own study and, ultimately, destined to fail – if they even start, that is.</p>
<p>Someone has already given you the best answer when it comes to programming. ‘Read a book’. The books have example code that you can work through. Some books will omit boilerplate code for the sake of brevity, but many have fully functional code examples which you can play with to discover what works and what doesn’t.<br>
As for not being able to learn from a book, my only response to that is ‘toughen up’. If you want something, and I mean really want something, then you make it work.</p>

<p>Looks like you infected yourself, I mentioned this earlier in the thread but you just capitalised “stupidity”, congratulations on defining yourself with it.</p>
<p>I doubt you’re older than me, if you are &gt;20 then I’d expect you to have the maturity to do as people have said and pick up a book and learn. Of course age is irrelevant, you’re asking for help with programming and programming is more or less governed by experience so since you’re the one asking for help (therefore zero experience) maybe it’d make sense to shut the fuck up and just listen to some advice?</p>
<p>You can’t just learn Java over night, you’re blatantly a lazy, sorry, and mislead individual if after two years of trying you’re still trying to find a method of learning something which has been published in thousands of books. It requires picking one up and reading, then doing. How hard to understand is that? or maybe you’d just like to continue ignoring our advice and just throw a few more grammatically incorrect flames our way.</p>

<p>Here’s a tip straight away, you can’t capitalise random words when you’re programming or it just wont work. If you do it in your normal everyday typing then you’re not paying enough attention to detail. Programming like anything is a skill made up of skills, you need a keen eye and precise logical thinking in order to avoid making lots of silly mistakes that will just cost you vast quantities of time to fix.</p>
<p>If you’re motivated to learn you should start proof reading posts, modifying grammar and spelling mistakes. Java is far more complicated than writing a forum post, you need to get in good habits now. Also RAFB.</p>

              <p>First set a goal for what you want to accomplish.<br>
Read a book about Java , DON’T rely on tutorials, they are usable if you want to do a single thing, but you learn little of it.<br>
Read more about general programming, since just knowing the language would not get you to the goal.</p>
<p>On the way, find a good solution about how to use what you have learned to solve problems. As Ollie wrote, using it to do homework in Math and Physics can be a nice way.</p>

<p>I find the best way to learn is by doing, get hands on and solve some problems which you need to solve for your own needs. I used to create algorithms to solve my math homework so it would take a vast amount of time less and leave me to play my games more ;p cheating but hey, its the result not how you got there right?</p>
