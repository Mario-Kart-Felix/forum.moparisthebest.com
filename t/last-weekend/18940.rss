    <title>Last Weekend</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/last-weekend/18940</link>
    <description>Last weekend was the funnest. Me and my friend (Jake) went up to Barliegh Ranch Motocross Track. It was just me and Jake, because my dad was working on the track with his friends of the commitee who run the track, getting it ready for the Australian Championship, in Flat-track. Jake&#39;s dad is racing, because mine does Motocross. So me and Jake had the whole track to ourself. We were hitting the 80ft tables and stuff (Jake wasn&#39;t making them though) He was landing in the middle of them. He&#39;s a flat-tracker though, he isn&#39;t good at Motocross, but he kick&#39;s my ass in Flat-track. I kick his arse in Motocross.

Over all it was that fun.</description>

<p>What the mother fuck are you talking about. Notice the lack of question mark which quite truthfully means I don’t care.</p>

<p>Actually, I metaprogram my life experience with agnostic rituals, sleep deprivation, herbal remedies, and meditation.</p>
<p>Most of the time I work and sleep, I spend about an hour a day on the computer.</p>
