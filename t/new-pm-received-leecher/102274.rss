    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;With new updates, come new glitches. This one is no exception, but this glitch is immensely large. In the museum, you can gain lamps that will up your XP in a chosen skill by 1k, or 10k xp. Jagex seem to have handled the item creation incorrectly, resulting in the following glitch.
DIGSITE QUEST IS REQUIRED. (EASY, SHORT QUEST)


In the museum, stand in THIS spot:

[IMG]http://i19.tinypic.com/4ulem9w.png[/img]

When you are there, set the amount of lamps you wish to create using the + and - buttons. Click whether you wish to create 10k xp or 1k xp lamps.

Do not create more than 28 lamps at once, as this will usually result in you disconnecting from Runescape. I&#39;ll fix this later.

THIS PROGRAM IS NEWLY MADE, PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS TO ME.
