              <p>Did u make this from nothing? If so then u would add a command in player.java…If its a server and u just added stuff the (source side) go into player.java and search for sumthing to do with the owner so like in mine it was ben…You just change that…Then in command.java you search the name it was (example it was ben) and simply change it…Easy as pie.</p>
