    <title>Invisible Item Set</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/invisible-item-set/373925</link>
    <description>I recently started using a 317 client with 621 items, and I&#39;ve got an issue with the Dungeoneering ranged body set.
All 11 of them make the character invisible when they are worn.
They are equipped in the right slot, and they&#39;re identified in the server so they function like &quot;fullBody&quot;s.
(Whether they we&#39;re identified as such or not didn&#39;t make a difference though...)
I tried replacing their models with the same models I got from a 634 model dump, but that didn&#39;t seem to work either.
(I used a different ID for the items using the 634 items to be sure I was loading them right)

Any suggestions?</description>
