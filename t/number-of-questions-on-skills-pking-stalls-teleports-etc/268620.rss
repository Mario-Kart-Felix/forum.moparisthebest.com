    <description>just need to know where all of that is located :) looked and I cant find.

Also, I cannot teleport to certain areas, e.g. al-kharid, lumbridge, Varrock, etc. Im pretty sure these places exist on my server, but It does not allow me to teleport to the coords I put in. Any clues?

thanks if you take the time to answer :)</description>

              <p>funny, it didnt show up before. I might have looked when I was further down the code <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=6" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"> thank you anyway I will check now…</p>
<p>…checked, yeah I think I searched thieving instead of stall (noob spotlight on me) <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> thanks heaps. I changed so now its a bit fairer (you could get a red phat from a stall wtf lol) so you get a fairer sum of money. Now people actually have to work for it lol <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I have a follow-up question; how do I edit teleport spells? Example, I want to change where everyone starts off to a place like edgeville or Lumbridge. All I need to do is change the teleport spells to send the player to a set coordinate, but I have no idea how. Probably something easy like search teleport but if anyone could tell me how to exactly access it that would be really good to <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>thanks again.</p>
