    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/disabling-graphics/167202</link>
    <description>Hello there. I have been working on a bot called JIF. My name on other forums is illusion but i registered along time ago with this name and haven&#39;t been bothered to re-register anyways i have the following code to disable graphics and it seems to not be working if anyone could help me, it would be really appreciated.

[code]
CanvasHack = (org.jif.hooks.Canvas) getClient();
CanvasHack.setEnabled(!CanvasHack.isGraphicsEnabled());[/code]

Were getClient() is my client hook and CanvasHack is my Canvas hook

Thanks!</description>

<p>The Euler angles are three angles introduced by Leonhard Euler to describe the orientation of a rigid body with respect to a fixed coordinate system. They can also represent the orientation of a mobile frame of reference in physics or the orientation of a general basis in 3-dimensional linear algebra.
 Any orientation can be achieved by composing three elemental rotations, i.e. rotations about the axes of a coordinate system. Euler angles can be defined by three of these rotations. They can also ...</p>

              <p>They use light zelix obfuscation and either use soot or something they wrote after studying soot as there are transformations applied to the code that are not found in zelix but sound suspiciously like those found in the paper written by one of the students involved in the primary work of soot.<br>
ex: I have not found any option for zelix to mangle method signatures. I also have a strong feeling that their static field/method transforms (contextual location mangling) is custom.</p>
<p>qauters: Create something simple and run it through zelix under aggressive with or without string encryption. Take what you get and decompile it. After doing so, I have a feeling you will wish to correct your comment. Aggressive flow transformations imposed by zelix are fairly devastating. I have only toyed with it in passing but it was enough to turn me away unless I really wanted to get to the source.</p>
<p>krich: I’ve seen only one completely deobfuscated/renamed runescape 3d renderer; wL did it. Not that my word carries any weight, but after looking at all of wL’s source, I am constrained to say that he is by far and away the top of any list of any rogue rs developer. He has done more with their client than anyone. I thought I did some interesting things… his deep understanding of the underlying math involved with 3d transformations is clear with his renamed client.</p>
<p>Didn’t mean to make that sound like a eulogy…</p>

According to Zelix the performance drop by 30%, when using their best protection. I think they use this, cause the easy protection hardly change anything.</p>

<p>Ollie has earned our disrespect, yakman. To put it in short, he took the hard work of frank_, newbiehacker, and I and removed all credit to us with the exception of a single “<span class="mention">@author</span> frank_” that he accidentally left (this also proves his story for it is a lie). He then proceeded to shit on newbiehacker’s beautiful configuration style. Finally, he handed it to us on a cute little platter, acting quite proud of it. Wouldn’t you be pissed about that?</p>

</aside>
<p>credit was given to you, newbiehacker and frank, and in EVERYSINGLE updater file by frank author tags were left.<br>
if i were to release, i would with a credits file containing such information.<br>
so get your dick out of your arse for once and take it like a man.</p>

<p>Jagex has registered <a href="http://mecscape.com" rel="nofollow noopener">mecscape.com</a> and all the other derivatives (.net/.org/etc…). So it is clear that it will probably be released at some point in time. On the RS forums there is only one thread you can talk about it. If you post elsewhere there will be penalties apparently.</p>

<p>scar has reason to be hated, it is inefficient; you can only run one client at a time, its colour based, it relies on searching, it hijacks the user’s mouse, there are probably more reasons to hate it but i cant be bothered atm</p>

              <p>why are you guys so gay against Ruler and Ollie, theres precious few knowledgeable people left, and I’d much rather talk to ruler then talk to the guy who made this thread, hey sometimes I’d choose ruler over frank_.</p>
<p>Why don’t we have some piece and love?</p>
<p>non of you people are perfect and nether am I, but I still put up with all of that and try to have a conversation.<br>
Like I don’t like how frank_ always talks and talks and talks and never does anything.<br>
and how Silver Lining seems very very lazy, “I’v been working on generibot for 10 years and I’v only got to put the last full stop, but I can’t be asked to do that!”</p>
<p>and both of you are so incredibly elitist, every time a very slightly un-knowledgeable person comes along, you both shit on him like a toilet, and you’re not the only ones.<br>
I also don’t like frank_ cause he hates Scar but <span class="bbcode-s">they</span> <span class="bbcode-b">We</span> are doing much more autoing, are more organized, and generally nicer over there at Scar-dedicated forums.</p>
<p>^<span class="bbcode-i">despite</span> all this dislike, we still talk sometimes on IRC and stuff like that.</p>
<p>so Ollie has removed some <span class="mention">@author</span> tags from a project I’v never heard of, you think hes the only one? how many times I’v blatantly plagiarism all of your bots and clients, and when I make my own version, all I hear is “great job yakman, i wish i could do that”, well you can, you just need to plagiarise some more.</p>
<p>remember, in our communist times, all code is everyones property, when you release or send something, you feed it into the combined peer-to-peer machine that is rscheating, so have some consolation that ‘your’ code is being put to good use.<br>
I don’t even know what ruler’s done, so it must have been long ago or un-interesting, so why don’t you just forget it and get along,</p>
<p>^I’m not saying Ollie and ruler are perfect either, like sometimes you can be talking to ruler and he suddenly goes very quiet, because you’ve insulted him by accident, then you have to change the subject to get back… its a real drag.</p>
<p>and what’s methscape?</p>

<p>Of course it will be.  Several of Gower’s later mini games were obfuscated, then RSC was obfuscated with that same obfuscation (lol).  RS2 was obfuscated from the start, and there is no reason why MechScape will not be obfuscated.</p>

              <p>Mm, to lower cpu cycles minimize the shifts, and crash the sound engine. These are both easily accomplished, the shifts are just like value &amp;= Type.bitLength… And the sound engine? Inject a throws in the sound engine intializer. Once the midi mapper/synth is dead, along side the lack of necessity for it to optimize shifts in the runtime engine cuts cpu usage drasticly, way more than you’d think.</p>
<p>Which leads me to infer that the Jagex engine, is far far better than the end client we see. I’m of the opinion that the obfuscation massacres the efficiency and capabillity.</p>

Assuming that the app is the Applet component in which runescape is just do:</p>
<p>Graphics g = app.getComponentAt(1,1).getGraphics();</p>
<p>//Do whatever you want with g, ie: g.fillRect(5,5,10,10);</p>
<p>If your writing a graphics system for your bot just put all of the paint methods in there own thread. Example, I put the paint-mouse in its own thread and the regular graphics paint in another thread. If I’m compltely off about what your even talking about than excuse me but you only posted two lines of code which had little relevance.</p>
