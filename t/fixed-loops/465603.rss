[s]I want it to loop through every string in the first array (obviously), but I honestly cannot find out what the problem is. It is probably something simple that I&#39;ve just repeatedly scanned over, but whatever. If anyone can take a look at this to see what the problem is, I would be very thankful.[/s]

It was looping through the multidimensional array, not the actual data. I fixed it, but I&#39;m pretty sure the code can be reduced though, so if you still want to help, try to make the code more efficient.</description>

<p>portion of checkCompletion. Currently it runs in a very odd cycle, one that’s very hard to follow. It’s bad to loop like this, because imagine having over 1k lines of code, over 50 methods, being called spontaneously. You wouldn’t be able to make a perfect loop every time, and if you could, no one else could follow it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
