              <p>Thank you! We’re all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view, you ridiculous little carnival freak. Dullard, do yourself and everyone else a favor: disconnect your computer from the Internet.</p>
<p>When I want your monkey-brained opinion I’ll rattle your cage, okay? Wouldn’t clues have more room to fit in your head if you got rid of some of the gobbledygook in there? You’ve got a big hole in your head, now shut it. When you are at a loss for words, your loss is our gain. To quote Thomas Brackett Reed: “They never open their mouths without subtracting from the sum of human knowledge.”</p>
<p>You are about as entertaining as watching grass grow in a windowbox. What do you do for a living? You are living, aren’t you? If I had wanted to talk to somebody with your personality, I would be at the damn pet store talking to the lizards. Maybe you wouldn’t come across as such a jellyfish-sucking mental midget if you’d had enough oxygen at birth; if your weren’t so fat that your clothes come in three sizes: Extra Large, Jumbo, and Oh-My-God-It’s-Coming-Towards-Us!, or if you didn’t have a face that makes your dentist treat you by mail-order. Who am I kidding? You would.</p>
<p>In conclusion, thank you. We were all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of view. Now get the hell out of here!</p>
