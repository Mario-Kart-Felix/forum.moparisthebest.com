Introduction

This basically means there&#39;s no spawning and any items people obtain will have been earned through PVM or PKing. This means our items will have value, making everything more fun, giving players something to aim for and of course making it so much better when you finally get that kill for rare items. There are tons of different ways to exchange your items including specific market areas, clan chats, and even a dedicated section on forums. Being a new server we want to get our economy right the first time. To ensure we achieve this we have made drop rates at a perfect level to maintain item drops for PvMers, but also to give just enough that we&#39;re not flooded with items and massive inflation like you see on most other private servers.

Skill-Points
Hate to train some skills? No problem! We have found a solution. When you level, you&#39;ll gain skill points. With these points you can level up other skills. How awesome is that!?

PvM
Did the other monsters get boring? And do you want a choatic weapon? Try our new monsters that will drop them! They also drop new bones. These bones are way better than dragon bones!

PvP
Our server is mainly based on PvP. So that is very important and is one of many that we focus the most on.

Skilling
We notice that on alot of servers that you miss something when training a skill. It is not rewarding, however we have made it that it is! At the end, you&#39;ll be a rich man just because you trained your skills.

Clan Chats
Want someone to chat with? Make your own clan to dominate other clans? We have this feature!

Creation Skill
We&#39;ve come up with a new skill. The creation skill. When you get a plan as a drop, you&#39;ll be able to make a weapon with that plan. How high the skill, the better weapons you can create. Here are some plans..

Other ways to get money
You can get tasks. These tasks will get you some money when completed. Don&#39;t worry, they aren&#39;t hard and are worth the time! A good way to get money when you love skilling!

Coloured completionist capes
Dont like the red colour? We have more!

Trivia
Want to get more knowledge about Runescape in general? This may be a good way to learn more!

Daily Tasks &amp; Free Daily Spins
You don&#39;t do daily tasks for nothing, it gives good rewards for the time spent.

Voting rewards
Don&#39;t want to spend alot of money with donating? And you want the full benefits that a bronze donator has? You can basically get it for ever, without even spending a penny!

Prestige System
Want to make some money, pk-ing points and squeal of fortune tickets? Then you can try our Prestige System. You only have to max out your combat skills. There are actually 250 prestiges. The points you get is: prestige * 1! How awesome is that?

Godwars
You&#39;ll have to gather some friends to slay the bosses in Godwars. Saradomin, Armadyl, Bandos &amp; Zamorak

Items
We do have some items new, some are from Runescape 2007, others are from RS3, but don&#39;t worry. The items from RS3 can&#39;t be used in PKing.[/center]</description>
