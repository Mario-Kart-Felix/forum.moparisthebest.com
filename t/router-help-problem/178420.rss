    <description>ok i got my router from sky broadband.

i have 2 computers connected to the router and 2 laptops

i have been trying to port forward for a long time. i enter the ip in and enter what should be admin/password or 1234, i click ok and it just prompts me again for the username and pass? wtf?

my router is netgear dg834gt. no one has changed the router&#39;s user and pass!

what is wrong? 

i dont want to use hamachi because no one ever comes on my server.

help me please. i really want to run it on normal.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 03, 2008, 04:54:39 PM[/size][hr]help me[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 03, 2008, 05:00:05 PM[/size][hr].</description>
