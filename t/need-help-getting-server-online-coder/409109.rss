    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-getting-server-online-coder/409109</link>
    <description>Okay, so I need some serious help lol. I downloaded a source and client and Im pretty sure PortForward&#39;d correctly, but Im a noob at this,  and Im a girl so I got some serious issues lol! Anyone who can help me get the server online is PROMISED a staff position!!! Im also looking for someone who can help me with the coding. I have some knowlage of how to code, but Im by no means a pro :) Staff position is also PROMISED for the coder! I want to make a server that people will be wanting to come back to everyday :P Any and all help is appreciated! (p.s I also have Teamviewer if that helps any)
