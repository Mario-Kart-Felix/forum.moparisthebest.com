    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/sub-atomic-universes/509460</link>
    <description>this may have been said before but it always interests me - has anyone noticed how an atom can on some levels look like the planets orbiting around a star, you get different atoms with different amounts of electrons and the electrons orbit the the atom in shells so what if these shells were seperated by an asteroid belt like how sections of our solar system are. Also when you get a picture of the universe web it does strangely look like a tissue structure so what if each atom in our body was a solar system and each muscle fibre was its own universe and our solar system is an atom on the muscle fibre of a human?</description>

As far as I know we do not know nor can we currently understand the topology of the universe. I’m sure we know what the observable universe looks like as far as where what is located, however.</p>

<p>OK i knew that i just didn’t gather from your post that you meant that there isn’t smaller matter between the electron shells, cheers for clearing that up.</p>
<p>Maybe we just don’t have equipment powerful enough yet to detect something on that microscopic of a scale.</p>

These aren’t the best comparisons but here is a decent comparison to re-iterate my point about electrons and the solar system;<br>
Solar System: <a href="http://neography.com/_base/uploads/solar_system.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://neography.com/_base/uploads/solar_system.jpg</a><br>
Atom: <a href="http://itc.gsw.edu/faculty/speavy/spclass/chemistry/atoms.3.gif" rel="nofollow noopener">http://itc.gsw.edu/faculty/speavy/spclass/chemistry/atoms.3.gif</a></p>
<p>My original point was the similarities in both of these pairs of pictures.<br>
What if an atom was a scaled down solar system and our solar system itself was an atom in a giant human being, if you do a quick google search you can find many thesis (not sure on the plural version of the word) on atoms containing universes of their own.</p>
<p>Hopefully that clarifies my original post and I apologize for my lack of grammar in it.</p>
