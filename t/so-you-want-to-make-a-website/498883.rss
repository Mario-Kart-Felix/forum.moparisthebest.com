    <title>So, you want to make a website?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-you-want-to-make-a-website/498883</link>
    <description>Hello there, Moparians.

I&#39;ve been away from the whole tutorial side of this board for quite some time now, I&#39;ve just been busy with work and stuff. Getting old never allows for for time to play around with I suppose. This is more or less being posted just because people continually private message me, ask me in the irc, ask me on RuneScape and just everywhere they see me if I can make them a website. This is a tutorial on creating your very own website from scratch and you can change it to your own needs and how you&#39;d like it to look, this just gets you started. This tutorial will first talk you through the entire chain of thought of creating your own website and then I will write the most common CSS styling codes you will use and the general rules for them.

[b]So, where do I start my website?[/b]
You start by deciding what you want to make your site for and who you&#39;re going to be aiming that site at. So lets say since this community does revolve around RuneScape private servers that we&#39;re making a site for one of those. You&#39;d start by thinking about the main backing of your game, which is medieval type times. Now you can start brain-storming certain things about medieval times. Here&#39;s a few that come to my mind:

[ul][li]Maces[/li]
[li]Brick walls(dark)[/li]
[li]Flames/Torches[/li]
[li]Catapults[/li]
[li]Castles[/li][/ul]

Along-side those a dark-themed site is in need since those times were also known as the dark ages etc. You [b]can[/b] make a light themed RSPS site all you want, this is just how I would make it. 

The next thing you want to think of is the colour-scheme. Now, a common downfall of many new website designers is they have a large range of colours which clash and don&#39;t work well together, this is a big no-no. The first thing a lot of new users see of your server is the website and the website is the epicenter of the entire server, not the game. Without the website you wouldn&#39;t have a web-client and without a web-client you&#39;d be missing a large part of your player base and those users who use the downloadable client wouldn&#39;t be able to get the link very easily. What I&#39;m getting is that if you don&#39;t have a visually appealing and user-friendly site you&#39;re gonna be struggling a lot more than you usually would. Back to the colour scheme: You&#39;re going to want to choose two base-colours. If I&#39;m thinking of a dark-themed site I would then think of a colour that fits well with black, which is actually a lot of colours. Lets take gold. Black and gold are two very good colours that compliment each other, especially if you&#39;re focusing around an older site, or at least I think so. So you&#39;ve now picked your two primary base colours, your other colours should now be variations of those. So I&#39;ll say a light-ish grey and a more darker coloured gold.

Now you have your colours you can start planning out the layout of your site and the images you&#39;re going to be using inside it. Now, layout is incredibly important, I can&#39;t express this point enough. Layout is key. If you don&#39;t prioritise what you want your users to see first and how you&#39;d want to show them then you&#39;re going to be displaying a lot of pointless things on the homepage. Now, I personally usually add the banner of the site to the middle of the top of the page, add a simple navigation bar, nothing too hard to figure out. Make sure your navigation links are relevant and work well, we don&#39;t need links misleading people! Much like this:

[center]
[img]http://puu.sh/29sLd[/img]
[/center]

I then follow up with some form of image slider, just to show some good aspects of the game to lure (for want of a better word) people in, I then start to display the latest news of the server in a &quot;zig-zagged&quot; form. Take a look at the image below to explain it:

[center]
[img]http://puu.sh/29s4k[/img]
[/center]

This follows on an article I read a while back (1 - 2 years) where your eyes are naturally told by your brain to read in this form, it also looks very nice aesthetically; which is what we&#39;re pushing for. You will need to add your own styling to this, of course :P. Now, after displaying the news in this fashion I would then move on to creating the footer. The footer I would include would also have a fair bit of navigation involved, something similar to this:

[center]
[img]http://puu.sh/29svH[/img]
[/center]

Okay, so now we can get on to the proper code of the site!

[b]How do I put these thoughts into action?[/b]
This is where the code comes in. Now, I see people who have went off on their own accord and created their own site and code daily but the problem is it&#39;s almost always full of deprecated code. I&#39;m going to teach you the latest and greatest website design techniques, or at least with the code-side. I&#39;ll provide you with a bare-bones HTML document and then some snippets of CSS code to get you started. Obviously I&#39;ll link you to the CSS documentation too so you can see how you&#39;d use different code for different things and ultimately you can become a competent website developer. Now, just remember HTML is for semantics and CSS is for [b]all[/b] styling. Okay, so here&#39;s the barebones HTML document:

[code=HTML]
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;title&gt;YOUR SITE TITLE&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;link href=&quot;css/main.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]

Okay, so now you have that you can start building on top of it; save this file as &quot;index.html&quot;. I personally would now start with the CSS file. Before we go any further I&#39;m going to show you a folder structure for an effectively organised website. Here&#39;s how yours should look:

[center]
[img]http://puu.sh/29t8R[/img]
[/center]

All CSS files go in the css folder, all images associated with the website are included in the img folder and all JavaScript which is used in the creation of the website is saved to. This allows you to easily navigate your folders and find the files you need to edit easily. You should also keep the names in all of your folders [b]lowercase[/b], this allows for easy navigation in the through URL&#39;s. If you are going to include spaces or two words in your folders you should also use a hyphen or also known as a dash (-) between words. 

Okay, now, create a file called &quot;main.css&quot; inside the css folder. Here is the link to the [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/CSS_Reference]CSS documentation by Mozilla[/url]. You can also view the [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Getting_Started]CSS Tutorial for beginners by Mozilla.[/url]

To style your background of your site you would like to do something along these lines:
[code=css]
body {
  width:100%;
  font-family: &#39;SomeFont.tff&#39; font type;
  background-image: url(./path/to/your/image.jpg);
}
[/code]
The above code would your site stretch to the size of even the largest screen resolution, since the width is declared as 100%. You&#39;re then setting your font that you wish to use for the most part of your website. You&#39;re finishing up with setting the image you want set as the background of your site, I&#39;ll explain this code a little further below with the selectors part.

A very crucial part of your site is that you want to aim for multi-resolution support alongside multi-browseral support. The only browser you [i]really[/i] have to worry about is Internet Explorer but that in it&#39;s own is a whole topic worth, if you feel you&#39;re struggling with getting your site compatible with IE and Google can&#39;t explain it well enough then feel free to request me to make a tutorial on it and I will, it&#39;s a fairly simple fix but there&#39;s no point in giving you a fix if you don&#39;t understand the mechanics behind it, that way you&#39;re learning and if you merely get handed the fix you won&#39;t be learning, you&#39;ll just be relying on others and not be becoming a competent website designer. Okay, so getting back to multi-resolutions. Obviously not everyone has just a single screen resolution and this can really, really make you lose your sites &quot;umph&quot;. Now, the first and easiest way to create a multi-resolutional site is to just create what&#39;s known as a container. For this you&#39;d use something similar to this:
[code=css]
.container {
  width: 990px;
  margin: auto;
}
[/code]
Okay, so what this code is doing is declaring that when the div class container is called in the HTML file you&#39;ll have a file width of 990 pixels. This is then centered using the margin-left to be auto and margin-right to be auto. I&#39;ll talk you a little through the construction of this code:

[i]container[/i] is known as a selector.
[i]width[/i] is known as a property.
[i]990px;[/i] is known as the value.

The above stands for all CSS code, replace [i]container[/i] with whatever you wanted your selector to be, replace [i]width[/i] with whatever property you were using, for a full list of properties take a look at the CSS documentation I linked to above. If you replaced the [i]990px;[/i] value with something else it would still work. Values for sizes can also be called in percentages which is very handy for styling the body feature of your site.

You can see the semi-colon after each value, this is to separate the values from each the next property. Because this starts with a &quot;.&quot; it&#39;s known as a class selector. If the selector began with a #(number sign/hash) it&#39;s known as an id selector, and if it was just the words container it would be known as a tag selector. These are called into CSS like this:
[code=html]
&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
     This is for the class selector container
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
     This would call the id selector container, in other words if it started with a #. 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;container&gt;
     This would call the tag selector container, if it didn&#39;t have a . or # in front of it.
&lt;/container&gt;
[/code]

[quote=&quot;Mozilla Doc&quot;]If more than one rule applies to an element and specifies the same property, then CSS gives priority to the rule that has the more specific selector. An ID selector is more specific than a class selector, which in turn is more specific than a tag selector.[/quote]

[b]A list of useful properties[/b]
I will give you a list of useful properties that I use day-to-day as a website designer, these properties will have the values there and you just need to change them. I&#39;ll add explanation to the properties I see fit.

[b]Pseudo-classes[/b]
Just a quick run-through on pseudo classes. These may be a little too advanced for a very beginner, but you must use them eventually if you wish to create a decent website. Basically a pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that gives a special state to the element this selector is called to. For example, :hover or :visited are needed to make a decent nav bar. If you don&#39;t use both of these your browser will colour visited links to their default colour, usually a variation of purple. This will not flow with your site.

Here&#39;s the general syntax:
[code=css]
.selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
[/code]

Useful and most commonly used pseudo-classes:

[ul][li][url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:link]:link[/url] [/li]
[li][url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:visited] :visited [/url][/li]
[li][url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:active] :active [/url][/li]
[li][url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:hover] :hover [/url][/li]
[li][url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:focus] :focus [/url][/li]
[li][url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:first-child] :first-child [/url][/li]
[li][url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/:nth-child] :nth-child[/url][/li][/ul]

[b]HTML tags[/b]
Below is a list of HTML tags that could and probably will be of use to you throughout your website design career. This covers everything from the very basic tags right through to HTML5 structural tags, these are listed in the same way the CSS is above. You can also view the docs relating to HTML in it&#39;s entirety [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML]here.[/url] If you want to read up on HTML5, you can read [url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/HTML5]here[/url], which I highly, highly suggest.

[b]The box model[/b]
The box model is a very important concept to any competent designer and should be brought in and pumped through you from a very early stage. Not a lot of beginners understand this but it is rather important so try reading over it a few times if you don&#39;t catch on. The box-model is used when people are discussing a CSS based layout, basically any HTML element can be considered a box and this means that the box model applies to all elements. The box model is what specifies the box and its attributes relate to each other. In simple terms, if an element is defined as to have a width of 50px and a height of 50px it should be drawn so. However, more can be added to a box - padding, margins to name but a few. I found this image online to explain it further:
[img]http://www.dbswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/box.png[/img]

So, let me talk you through this. A box is made up of 4 main features, you have the outside (margin) which is completely invisible, this has no effect on the elements behind it. You have the next step in (border) this basically gives definition to the part of the element which is on display. We take a further step in to find the padding, this defines the space between the content of the box and the border. We then finally have the content. Keeping up so far? Good! When you&#39;re defining the content of a box in CSS you only actually define the size of the content part, you must define the padding, border and margin separately. Then and only then can the entire size of your box be calculated by the browser. As you can see, the browsers do a lot of work unseen by you. For every element on your page, the browser itself must run this formula:
[code]
box width = content width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
[/code]
 
If you haven&#39;t caught on, re-read above since that&#39;s mostly the important parts of it. Post any queries below.
 
[b]Moving swiftly on[/b]
If you think you&#39;re good enough, try your hand at PHP. I&#39;ve written something like 15(?) PHP tutorials in total in this board, you can find most of them using the search bar. I&#39;ve listed the best ones below and once I re-write the other scripts to meet todays standards then I&#39;ll list them here too. These are listed from best through to worst, I would highly recommend using the [url=http://www.php.net/manual/en/]PHP documentation[/url] over my tutorials.

<p>I’m more of a Sinatra fan than Rails, I find it better to work with. For a bigger project I’d maybe resort to Rails but most of the time for the stuff people make on a small scale Sinatra works better. I mean, for something like an RSPS voting system then Rails would be overkill.</p>

<p>What would you suggest I add?<br>

Maybe a few more HTML tags?  Seems you’ve only got the basic structure and divs then you move onto CSS.  I know a certain degree should be left to the user to research but at least cover headings, form basics would be great too, and tables (emphasis on tabular information only!).  Then maybe a small section on the HTML5 structuring tags, , , ,  etc being the main ones.</p>
<p>Also it would be great to include an index of your PHP tutorials you’ve done in the past either at the top or bottom, it’s a shame to see them slide through the depths of this board, as of what I can remember they were very well written.[/quote]<br>
Yeah I was thinking on more of the HTML side myself, I’ll get on adding a load of tags and explanations or link to the docs like I did with CSS. I’ll definitely add the structuring tags too. Yeah I will add a form of index for all of those, I’ll need to re-write a few first since some of the code is deprecated <span class="bbcode-i">mysql_*</span> for example. Shouldn’t take too long though, I’ll get on doing it after I finish these logs on RS :P.</p>

<p>Also it would be great to include an index of your PHP tutorials you’ve done in the past either at the top or bottom, it’s a shame to see them slide through the depths of this board, as of what I can remember they were very well written.</p>
