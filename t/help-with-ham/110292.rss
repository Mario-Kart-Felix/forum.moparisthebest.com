    <description>Ok, I need to know if I&#39;m doing this right

First, I create my network on HAM
Second, I run my server

Once I run my server can other people access that server?[br][size=1]Posted on: June 13, 2007, 12:47:23 PM[/size][hr]OK! Scratch that! I need help with HAM period!

I need full instructions on getting my server up. Because I&#39;m a stupid nub! =\
If it says server down to other ppl, does that mean it&#39;s because of errors or just becuase HAM is setup right?!?!?!?!</description>
