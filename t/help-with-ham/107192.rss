              <p>Ok. I had same trouble, so what you do is…</p>
<p>Go to bottom-right and find a button that when you click on it, it says (create new network), (join network)</p>
<p>click on join</p>
<p>type in the server name exactly how it is spelled on forums. (for example: ServerScape V1)<br>
copy that exactly how it is spelled (upper-case and everything)</p>
<p>then type in the password. It should be on forums on their post.</p>
<p>A network, or something will come up. Then, search for the I.P adress it gives you on their post.<br>
double click their server (with the I.P adress and all that)</p>
<p>get on moparscape and type in the I.P adress. Then go to the top and click ‘File’<br>
After that, click on Server Port and type in the port.<br>
Again, you can find the I.P adress, Port number, hamachi information on their post.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helped =][br][size=1]Posted on: June 07, 2007, 07:24:25 AM[/size][hr]lol, spelled address wrong! my bad!</p>
