    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/best-worst-gaming-story-line-story-mode-recently-released/435846</link>
    <description>Hi, I&#39;d like to discuss some good video game story lines in here. I myself could care less about online play, because I hate it. I love myself a good game with a really good story line. 

I&#39;d also like to keep the obvious ones out of discussion, like Call Of Duty, and Halo, because pretty much everyone has a different opinion on them. I recently played bought a game called &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; and although it was a pretty good game overall, there was basically no story line to it. All you did was do some missions for people, and get fucked over in the end, so it was kinda disappointing. My favorite story line has to have a game called &quot;Gun&quot; It was a very old game, a lot like Red dead for that matter, but the story line actually made sense, there were actually twists in it, not some bullshit where you&#39;re practically someones bitch...

Anyways, lets discuss some games with bad story lines, and good story lines.</description>

<p>But in all seriousness, allot of games today don’t have a story line, instead we now have a thing called First person shooters.  If you want one of my favorite, and actually really long and challenging, games, then I would say LA Noire by Rockstar Games.  It’s graphics are the best I’ve seen in a long time.</p>

              <p>[quote=“SilentCJ, post:10, topic:435846”]I just completed Gears of War 3 last night, played it for about 7 hours straight yesterday and about 7 hours the day before.  Probably tied with Half Life 2 series on the best story I have ever played.</p>
<p>Oh and Far Cry 2 was pretty shocking for the story.[/quote]</p>
<p>Not a fan of Gears of Wars, just doesn’t interest me for some reason.</p>
