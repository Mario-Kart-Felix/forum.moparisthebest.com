*~* Controlled Pkz is a new 317 revision server that has been released as of 8/26/2013 *~*


Here at Controlled Pkz you can boss with others, we have a range of bosses:
- Godwars
- Kalphite Queen
- KBD 
- Jad 
- chaos elemental
- Dagganoths 
- Also a team boss - Flambeed

We are a Pk based server with a lot more to it, There are a variety of bosses for you to kill and obtain points + items along with a few skills to help you along your way of earning GP and
not to mention, Pking to your hearts content with the Player killing point system, save up and buy the untradeables and max out your bonuses or purchase a handy new special attack weapon
to wipe out your opponent and monsters! 

If you are to run out of gp or simply want to earn some more, you can thieve from the stalls which can be located in the general store or at the skills area, 
The stalls give caskets, you can open them and gain 50k. I worked it out at around 10m GP in around 20 minutes roughly.

Of course, do not fear.. You can make money just by Pking a player and selling the items you gain, depending on the goodies you get!
