    <title>How to make teleport commands</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-teleport-commands/376625</link>
    <description>This is how to add tele port commands.

1. go into client.java

2. do ctrl+f to do a find

3. then search &quot;command.start&quot;

4. then make a new space for the code to go in.

5. no add the code

                                  }
if(command.startsWith(&quot;home&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0){
triggerTele(3094, 3470, 0);
brightness = 4;
}

6. where it has (&quot;home&quot;) you can change the home to staff if you want your command to be ::staff to go to staff zone.

7. playerRights &gt;= 0){ change the 0 to a 1 to make it so only mods, admins and owner&#39;s can go to the command. or keep it as 0 for every one to be able to tele there.

8. triggerTele(3094, 3470, 0); this is the bit that tele&#39;s you some were. to get the place where you want the command to tele you to. You have to go to the spot then do ::mypos ingame. To get the possion it will come up with the cords. like 3055, 2763 if you want to tele to that possion you would have to change this &quot;triggerTele(3094, 3470, 0);&quot; to this &quot;triggerTele(3055, 2763, 0);&quot;.

hope it help&#39;s.
