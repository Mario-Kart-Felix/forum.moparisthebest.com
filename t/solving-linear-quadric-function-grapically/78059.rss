              <p>Graphically, you just plot points, draw both graphs, and see where they intersect.</p>
<p>In this case, you have a circle of radius 5 (with its center at the origin) and a linear equation.  I plotted it for you in derive quickly:</p>

<p>The first point is easy…plug in x = -5 into both equations and you obviously get 0 for y.  So you have 1 intersection (or solution) at x = -5.  but the second one is harder.  You could obviously trace it, but solving it algebraically would be best.  Note that a circle cannot be expressed as a single function - it fails the vertical line test.  So you need to have y equal to the positive and negative square roots of 25 - x^2.  I don’t want to do all the work for you, but the second solution of this equation is actually about 1.3</p>
