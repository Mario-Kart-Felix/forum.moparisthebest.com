    <title>Can`t find Richscape v3 source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-t-find-richscape-v3-source/359745</link>
    <description>Hi everyone. I`m new to Mopar forums and i tried to use Search but i can`t manage to find the Richscape v3 source. I went on google and downloaded some but all of them say they have trojans and much more ( My paid norton 360, avast,...). I really liked to play one of my friends source which was made from Richscape v3 and he lost them. :(

I don`t really know and he doesn`t know too if its Richscape, im trying to find a source ( around 2007 one ) which has over 30 spawn item commands at the quest list, and you just had to click on it to get the items. The server had heal and much more.

If you could help me i would really apreciate. :D

P.S= As im new and couldn`t find the place to post this, i though it was here, but if it wasn`t, please delete it. :|</description>
