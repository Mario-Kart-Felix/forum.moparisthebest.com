    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-server-development/170537</link>
    <description>Hello, i&#39;m new to this part of moparscape. I am wanting to go into computer game design and I thought this would be a good place to start. I have looked through the tutorials and I really just don&#39;t understand any of them. So my question how do I get started cause I need a lot of help with this. Thank you.

...

I have another question with this one as well...

I have downloaded the moparscape client and a few of the other rar files like the new world v4 and my question is how exactly do i make it the new world v4. I have tried what i know of and still get stuck with the same old moparscape. So I need help please.

-testscape<br>
-pimpscape<br>
-project 16<br>

              <p>ok, i can help. is new world a source? to check to make sure it is, go to the “runserver” or “run” bat file, and double-click. after a while it should say "starting new world on 0.0.0.0:43594.</p>
<p>did it say that?</p>
<p>heres a minitutorial…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>open up the source (new world v4) and select the “run” or “runserver” file; it’s sign is a cog. just double click it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wait till it says “starting new world on 0.0.0.0:#####” the “#####” is the port, it can be 5,4,or 3 numbers long.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3)k, when you see it, open up moparscape and wait for it to load. then go to file, and click on “select port” or “port”. a little box will show and you will put the port from the “run” file. most likely, the port will be 43594, but it can be 5555 or something…</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>finally, put in your username and password, and make sure your IP says “127.0.0.1”, keep it that way. just start it and test out the server!</li>
</ol>
