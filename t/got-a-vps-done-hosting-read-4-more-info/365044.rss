    <description>Ok so this probably does not go here(I know) but I have been hosting a server for awhile and quite frankly got tired of all the hassle. I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to java coding, but I am not a pro. Anyways what I thought would be a good idea for me and maybe someone else, is that I will give my vps away, well not totally, I will stand along side someone who is atleast as good as i am at coding or better, all I want is admin and the rights to restart or fix server if the other person isn&#39;t on, so basically I want Co-Owner. If your worried about some &quot;noob&quot; trying to fool you into giving him a admin spot and messing things up don&#39;t worry... I am a family man, married with 1 kid, I do this only out of boredom and being unemployed I guess. I have played runescape since 2001 and that&#39;s why I guess I am addicted. If you want to go in on this with me just send me a private message or add my xbox live gt, Steal Your Mojo, I don&#39;t use messenger, so these are the only 2 ways to get ahold of me.</description>
