CelestialX is a brand new RSPS that has been designed by players, for the players. We have active and experienced staff members working everyday to improve both the server and the forums for maximum enjoyment. Our server consists of caring and considerate staff members, an active and welcoming community, many bosses and minigames, and much more for you to find out!

We have a great active staff team but we still need more people to help us out and to improve the server. We are searching for experienced people who are active.
