    <description>Hi,
Me and a friend have idea&#39;s on creating a mmorpg.. But we dont know how to go about it. 
I&#39;m currently taking java classes at school and xhtml. Our budget is arround £50-100 at the moment &amp; time to spend working onit is arround 3+ years. Were willing to put arround 6 hour minimum per day. 

If you could give us some advise or links to websites that talk about this.
- Thanks.</description>

If you really want to develop an mmorpg try waiting until college or at least until you have time and people to work on that.</p>

              <p>Ok guys, I don’t see what you are saying here. I started a project last year, to build a simple flash game, I had a general idea and I wanted to make that. I did not have ANY knowledge of ActionScript 3 whatsoever. So after 7 months of HARD work, writing the game, designing the game, making the sound effects. It ended up pretty nicely with a complete economical system, items in the shop based on what level you are, different types of weapons and I never exepted it to be like that. I also have a working highscore system and an income source from the game with ingame ads. It took me that long because I was learning the language as I was making the game. First it was how to get basic movement. Then couple of months later, I was learning basic PHP for being able to store highscore data on a MySQL database. Now, after those 7 months, I’d make the same game in 3 weeks time. I don’t need any tutorials anymore for creating applications on flash. The most important part of this process was: DON’T COPY AND PASTE,<br>
but try to understand the code, try to understand what it says, in the beginning it will be hard but evantually you’ll understand it. It might take long, but in the end you will have advanced knowlegde of several languages.</p>
<p>So I’d say, if you have a team that is SERIOUS and it willing to create a real MMORPG and work on it for 6 hours a day. Then damn, I’d go for it.</p>

              <p>I wouldn’t say <span class="bbcode-i">don’t try it</span> or anything related; if you’re willing to actually give this a shot, why not? Either it will be a waste of time, or it’ll pay off eventually. It’s not likely to actually make it, but if you do, it will seriously be worth it. Three, or more, years  is a great time-frame for creating an MMORPG, and if you actually make it, use that. Who knows, maybe eventually you could make your own company such as Jagex, Blizzard, EA Games, etc.</p>
<p>Though 100 euros won’t get the dedicated server for an MMORPG, maybe you could get a job and save up adding money to your bank account and add some funds to a credit card and get a great dedicated server for a few hundred players to get on. Since MMORPG grows rapidly, even a dedicated server that costs a few thousand a month may not be enough for rapidly growing communities that MMORPG tend to have. But that would be great because of all the donations, and get more donations for a better dedicated server; fantastic.</p>
<p>If you do pull this off, that’s great! I do hope this works out for you, much luck to you, sir; you will be needing it.</p>

<p>^ Best said.</p>
<p>It really is a waste of time to make a MMORPG with no experience, because at the end of the day when you look at what you’ve done, afterwards looking at another persons project, all you will be able to say to yourself is, “What is this piece of shit I just put together?”. You’ll then proceed to rewrite it again and again.</p>
<p>Experience given, I have rewritten my MMO five times, and I think (hope) this’ll be the last time. However, thats how I learned to code efficiently, so…</p>

Me and a friend have idea’s on creating a mmorpg… But we dont know how to go about it.<br>
I’m currently taking java classes at school and xhtml. Our budget is arround £50-100 at the moment &amp; time to spend working onit is arround 3+ years. Were willing to put arround 6 hour minimum per day.</p>
