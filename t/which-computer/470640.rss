    <title>Which Computer?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/which-computer/470640</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
So I&#39;ve been trying to decide between a new computer to buy, as I have completely ruined the one I have at the moment, with junk downloads over the years.
I&#39;ve been wanting to get a new computer for a while now, and have come to the conclusion that I need to decide between two laptops.

[b]A Picture Of My Current Computer Because I Can&#39;t Find a Link:[/b] [IMG]http://i47.tinypic.com/25i2d5v.jpg[/img]

1. Samsung ChromeBook
This is the link for the one I like the most at the moment [url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/landing.html]http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/landing.html[/url]

[code]
Pros:
-Cheaper
-Free cloud storage
-Lighter, more portable
-Dual-Band Wifi, and 12 Flight Wifi passes

Cons:
-Fairly new, hard to get a good helper with it
-Every program runs off of the internet, if there is no internet, I would need 3rd party programs handy
[/code]

2. Apple MacBook Pro
This is the link for the MacBook I&#39;ve been looking at [url=http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/]http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/[/url]

[code]
Pros:
-More stable
-Less viruses (they claim)Well-known
-Has a surplus of amazing reviews

Cons:
-Horrendously Expensive
-Running a private server will be different, from what I&#39;ve heard
-I will have to get used to a new OS
[/code]

What I&#39;m Looking For:

[ol][li]A Computer that doesn&#39;t overheat in a half hour of use[/li]
[li]A Computer that can run RuneScape flawlessly[/li]
[li]A Computer that can handle many Java projects[/li]
[li]Good browser support[/li]
[li]Everything that a computer should have[/li][/ol]


*Note: These aren&#39;t the only two computers I am open to look at. I am being very open-minded with this, and  I am open to suggestions.</description>

              <p>If you want a computer to fit all of your interests stated above, I suggest purchasing a gaming computer online. You can probably find one starting off at around $700. They only problem with them is that most are probably desktops, which means you can’t move it all of the place as easily as a laptop allows.</p>

<p>Just wipe the hard drive.</p>
<p>If you genuinely just want a new machine though, why are you asking us to compare a budget netbook with a high spec notebook?  The choice is obvious.<br>
And the ‘con’ point you have for the MacBook that states that you’d have to get used to a new OS is just silly, you’ll get that with both of your choices, it runs a Chrome OS not just a browser with ‘internet programs’.</p>
<p>Just buy a Windows laptop of similar price to the Macbook, you will not be disappointed, you can get a fairly high spec gaming notebook for that price.</p>

Very fast (this may just be because it’s brand new), and there is no problem connecting to the internet on it.

Or you could build a computer… It’s a lot less complicated than it seems. For the $1700 you’d be willing to pay for a Macbook Pro, you could build a computer w/ windows with a 3.6GhZ processor and a GTX680/690, 4-64gb of ram, whatever else you want really. Could run anything flawlessly.<br>

              <p>Hey guys,<br>
So I’ve been trying to decide between a new computer to buy, as I have completely ruined the one I have at the moment, with junk downloads over the years.<br>
I’ve been wanting to get a new computer for a while now, and have come to the conclusion that I need to decide between two laptops.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A Picture Of My Current Computer Because I Can’t Find a Link:</span> <img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/25i2d5v.jpg" alt width="640" height="480"></p>
<ol>
<li>Samsung ChromeBook<br>
This is the link for the one I like the most at the moment <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/landing.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/landing.html</a>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Pros:
-Cheaper
-Free cloud storage
-Lighter, more portable
-Dual-Band Wifi, and 12 Flight Wifi passes

Cons:
-Fairly new, hard to get a good helper with it
-Every program runs off of the internet, if there is no internet, I would need 3rd party programs handy</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Apple MacBook Pro<br>
This is the link for the MacBook I’ve been looking at <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/</a>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Pros:
-More stable
-Less viruses (they claim)Well-known
-Has a surplus of amazing reviews

Cons:
-Horrendously Expensive
-Running a private server will be different, from what I've heard
-I will have to get used to a new OS</code></pre>
<p>What I’m Looking For:</p>
<p>[ol][li]A Computer that doesn’t overheat in a half hour of use[/li]<br>
[li]A Computer that can run RuneScape flawlessly[/li]<br>
[li]A Computer that can handle many Java projects[/li]<br>
[li]Good browser support[/li]<br>
[li]Everything that a computer should have[/li][/ol]</p>
<p>*Note: These aren’t the only two computers I am open to look at. I am being very open-minded with this, and  I am open to suggestions.</p>
