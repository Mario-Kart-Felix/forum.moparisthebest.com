    <description>hey i have to do an assignment for one of my classes which involves linux/unix. I juss was wondering if you guys could help me out a lil. ann NO I DONT want you guys to do the whole thing for me thats pointless i would learn nothing, but i just want sum help and see what happends 
thanks
here is the assignment we have to do and im using Fedora.

[code]1. Basic chores
Complete the following tasks on your system (4 points for each completed task).
(a) setup your system so that the command mount /datadir -- executed by any user -- will attach the logical volume data-vol from the volume group called DATAGROUP (minimum 100 MB) to the mountpoint /datadir (The volume should NOT be automatically mounted at boot time) Use /dev/sda5 as the physical volume.
(b) setup your system login message to say &quot;Long Live Open Source&quot; (to be displayed on all virtual consoles after the login prompt)
(c) setup your system login banner to say &quot;Free as in --Free of Charge-- is good too.&quot; (User should see this before login to the system)
(d) setup your system so that every user has a command alias called &quot;deltempdir&quot; which will delete the contents of a directory called &quot;temp&quot; below their home directory. NOT the /tmp directory
 
2. Intermediate tasks
Research on your Fedora system to come up with sets of commands to accomplish the following tasks :
(5 points for each completed task)
(a) Display a list of all the files under the /etc directory and its sub-directories that have been created or modified within the last 2 hours.
(b) Display a list of all the files under the /var directory and all its sub-directories that have been created or modified today (since mid-night).
(c) Display a list of all the files under the /home directory and all its sub-directories that have been created or modified  within the last 6 days.
(d) Display a list of all the files under the /tmp directory and all its sub-directories that were more than 8 days old
      Put each set of commands in a separate file. Name the file for task (a) as ass1-a, task (b) as ass1-b, etc. It must be possible to run these script files simply by typing their name (set the permissions appropriately).

3. Applied Research
Study the man page for the &quot;sudo&quot; command and
(a) (8 points) update sudo&#39;s configuration file (using the proper program) to allow your Learn account to run sudo for the following commands as root:
    useradd
    route
    passwd
    ls
(b) (4 points) Create a new user called helper and allow this user to run sudo for the following commands as your learn account:
    tail
    find
   
4. Package Management
Research the &quot;rpm&quot; and &quot;yum&quot; commands to:
(a) (4 points) verify the integrity of a package using to see if any of its files have been altered since installation. (you will be asked to demonstrate this when your assignment is marked)
(b) (4 points) add the &quot;rpmfusion.org&quot; repository to the yum configuration. (you will be asked to demonstrate install a package from the rpmfusion repository when your assignment is marked) 

5. Wild ride
Find and install the XFCE dektop environment discussed in the following article:
XFCE Review (http://www.osnews.com/story.php/5478/XFce-4--A-Refreshingly-Solid-Desktop)  (5 points) 
(Hint: review the yum group commands) You will be asked to demonstrate how to switch to this desktop environment and back again without restarting the X server.
Find and install the E3 text editor from source code. The project page for it can be found here:
E3 Project (http://freshmeat.net/projects/e3) (7 points) 
You will be asked to demonstrate how to create a file using this editor.

6. SysAdmin portion
(8 points)
Create a bash script called /bin/snapshot.sh to record the following information:
    * A list of all users logged into the system.
    * A list of all processes running on the system.
    * A report of all mounted filesystems, the amount of space used and the amount of space available.
The information should be appended to the file /var/log/mysnapshot.txt
Research the at command and and schedule your script to execute at 1:00am on Wednesday July 15th.

7. Exploring Your Options
(14 points)
Visit the site for the &quot;SuperGrubDisk&quot; boot repair and management image. Download and setup the USB or CDROM image and research how to use it to manage your GRUB boot loader.
    * http://www.supergrubdisk.org/
    * http://www.supergrubdisk.org/wiki/Boot_Problems

You will have to demonstrate booting from the USB/CDROM in class. (5 marks)
Use the SuperGrubDisk to assist you to install a second Linux distibution onto your hard disk as a dual boot configuration. Your professor will assign the distribution to be installed to you on an individual basis.

You will have to demonstrate booting from the 2nd distro in class. (10 marks)

8. Submitting your assignment
(10 marks)
Parts 4, 5, &amp; 7 will be marked in class
Parts 1, 2, 3, &amp; 6 must be submitted on a filesystem image.

Make an 2MB (2048 1k blocks) ext2 formatted image file with a fileststem label that is your LearnID.
The image file should have the name &lt;learnid&gt;.img . Copy the following files to the image file:
    * /etc/fstab
    * /etc/issue
    * /etc/motd
    * /etc/bashrc
    * /bin/snapshot.sh
    * /etc/sudoers

Copy all of the script files created in part 2 to the image file.
Execute the following commands on your system:
    * atq &gt;&gt; assign1.data
    * lvs &gt;&gt; assign1.data
    * vgs &gt;&gt; assign1.data
    * pvs &gt;&gt; assign1.data[/code]</description>
