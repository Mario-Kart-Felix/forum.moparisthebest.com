    <description>I don&#39;t know if the brain part of mscp left or died, but cmon, I barely/don&#39;t get any replies on my help threads.
Where else do I have to go. Reposting in hopes somebody comes by with some knowledge.


[b]Q1:[/b]

As you can see only one sidebar is visible.
I have been looking for days but can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s causing it as I&#39;m sending all my sidebars and their data is correct.
[code=java]
	private static final int[] defaultSideBarIds = {639, 24999, 3213, 1644, 5608, 1151, 18128, 5065, 5715
			, 2449, 904, 147, 17011, 3917, 2423, 12855, 3333};

for (int i = 0; i &lt; defaultSideBarIds.length; i ++)
			PacketHandler.sendPacket(player, new SendSidebarInterface(i, defaultSideBarIds[i]));
[/code]
[code=java]public class SendSidebarInterface implements OutPacket {

	/**
	 * The interface id of the side bar.
	 */
	private final int interfaceId;
	
	/**
	 * The menu id of the side bar.
	 */
	private final int menuId;
	
	
	/**
	 * The constructor.
	 * 
	 * @param interfaceId The interface id.
	 * 
	 * @param menuId The menu id.
	 */
	public SendSidebarInterface(int interfaceId, int menuId) {
		this.interfaceId = interfaceId;
		this.menuId = menuId;
	}
	
	@Override
	public void send(Player2 player) {
		player.getOutStream().createFrame(71);
		player.getOutStream().writeShort(interfaceId);
		player.getOutStream().writeByteA(menuId);
	}

}[/code]

Maybe somebody has a better view on where to look for this issue or has had it himself?
Anyways any help that can get me on the right path to fix this is welcome.
Thanks in advance.


[b]Q2:[/b]
So I&#39;m trying to get the animated movement updating working.

I have this now:
[code=java]
		updateBlock.writeByteC(startLocation.getX()); //loc x
		updateBlock.writeByteS(startLocation.getY()); //loc y
		updateBlock.writeByteS(endLocation.getX()); //loc x 2
		updateBlock.writeByteC(endLocation.getY()); //loc y 2
		updateBlock.writeShort(10); //movement speed
		updateBlock.writeShortA(0); //back movement speed
		updateBlock.writeByte(4); //direction
[/code]
My target location is 5 on the x-axis away from the start location, though my character moves like 30 tiles.
I already tried using the region coordinates instead of the absolute world coordinates, but it does the same.
Anybody know how to properly use this update?



From the wiki: http://rsps.wikia.com/wiki/317_Protocol
&lt;blockquote&gt;0x400 The 0x400 mask is used to update the player so they appear to be asynchronously animating and walking. This mask is often used for the Agility skill. The data associated goes in order of: byte (type C) which is the first location&#39;s X coordinate value, byte (type S) which is the first location&#39;s Y coordinate value, byte (type S) which is the second location&#39;s X coordinate value, byte (type C) the second location&#39;s Y coordinate value. After the locations are written, there is a required movement speed which is written as a short which marks how fast to move from position 1 to position 2. Another short (type A) is written as the movement speed going from position 2 to position 1. Finally one byte is written to end the mask block, which marks the direction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

Try writing the same id to all of the sidebar’s and see if it displays them then? Does the prayer interface open if you click it? Are there any errors client sided? What are the 17 interfaceID’s in your array, because i count 16 slots?[/quote]<br>
Achievement/Quest tab is 17 and no,<br>
it doesn’t open when I click it.<br>
Their aren’t any errors thrown client sided either</p>
<p>[size=18pt]<span class="bbcode-b">EDIT:</span>[/size]<br>
I went looking client sided and I switched the ids lol.<br>
I just need help with the update mask now</p>
