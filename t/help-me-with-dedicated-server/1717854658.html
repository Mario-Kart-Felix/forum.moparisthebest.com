Quite honestly, you cant run your sever on it. Its not possible. You would have to have access to the server directly in order to do it, which you do not. and you dont have access to the server folders (not by means of ftp or cPanel) so you couldnt run it through there. Your only hope is to get your ip and try and access the folders from there, which isnt likely. I may be able to help, but i gotta know your ip. PM it to me.</p>
<p>I dont know why everybody wants to get a dedicated server…Just because Miss Silabsoft got one, doesnt mean everybody else should because</p>
<ol>
<li>She know what the fuck she is doing</li>

<p>Right, firstly, you can run your server on it, you thick shit.</p>
<p>Secondly, you do also connect it it, you thick shit.</p>

<p>Fourthly,  “I dont know why everybody wants to get a dedicated server…Just because Miss Silabsoft got one, doesnt mean everybody else should because”, i’ve never heard so much shit in my life. Firstly it’s “why do you make client wit da silab item silab did it first na na na” when they’re blatently jagex items, and now you can’t buy a dedicated server because silabsoft bought one? get a fucking grip ffs.

<ol>
<li>if you could run anything you want on it, a hacker can get control and run a batch script to wipe it, and annihilate the server so it becomes unusable.</li>
<li>if you had full access, you could install anything you wanted on it, which could compromise the integrity of the server farm.</li>
<li>all one has to know is the ip address and then from that they could find the ip block and take down every server through scripts run on the server. and it would look like the renter did it. it would cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars, and who would they blame? YOU!</li>
<li>they wouldnt allow you to run batch scripts on it for the reason that you could mess with the server that other customers might use down the road.</li>
<li>you could access the bios and screw it up</li>
<li>you could fuck with the os’ files and blame it on the host and sue them</li>
<li>you could take down the whole server farm’s internet connection</li>
<li>you could place malicious code in the files for the os and customers that use it down the road could be hacked and so could their customers</li>
<li>even if they wiped the drive and reinstalled the os, it would be possible to make an entry in the bios to add whatever code you want into the os that gets installed next</li>
<li>it would be just fuckin stupid if the hosting company let you have complete control, or even enough control, to run anything on it except normal web related things</li>
</ol>
<p>are those enough reasons? or do you want more?[/quote]</p>
<p>I have full SSH service which means i have total control over my server now, u have never had a dediserver or u would know and if u have it was a very shitty server!</p>

<li>you could place malicious code in the files for the os and customers that use it down the road could be hacked and so could their customers</li>
<li>even if they wiped the drive and reinstalled the os, it would be possible to make an entry in the bios to add whatever code you want into the os that gets installed next</li>

<p>I have full SSH service which means i have total control over my server now, u have never had a dediserver or u would know and if u have it was a very shitty server![/quote]</p>
<p>what does having a shitty server have to do with anything. besides, you have a shitty server. a 2ghz celeron with 1gb of ram. my shitty desktop has better specs than that! even my 4 year old laptop does! LOL. the server i had had an intel xeon processor (8 cores) 4gb of ram and was running mac os x server. thats about as good as it gets.</p>

using shell scripts is a whole different story. its possible to do it with that. but it requires a bit more knowledge. but still not too hard.<br>

<p>redhat doesnt have the ability to be controlled remotely. jesus fucking christ, learn something.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 08, 2008, 02:11:30 PM[/size][hr]i think i should elaborate on why you cant control it like a regular computer.</p>
<ol>
<li>if you could run anything you want on it, a hacker can get control and run a batch script to wipe it, and annihilate the server so it becomes unusable.</li>
<li>if you had full access, you could install anything you wanted on it, which could compromise the integrity of the server farm.</li>
<li>all one has to know is the ip address and then from that they could find the ip block and take down every server through scripts run on the server. and it would look like the renter did it. it would cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars, and who would they blame? YOU!</li>
<li>they wouldnt allow you to run batch scripts on it for the reason that you could mess with the server that other customers might use down the road.</li>
<li>you could access the bios and screw it up</li>
<li>you could fuck with the os’ files and blame it on the host and sue them</li>
<li>you could take down the whole server farm’s internet connection</li>
<li>you could place malicious code in the files for the os and customers that use it down the road could be hacked and so could their customers</li>
<li>even if they wiped the drive and reinstalled the os, it would be possible to make an entry in the bios to add whatever code you want into the os that gets installed next</li>

You are all fucking idiots.</p>
<p>If your server has an ftp server running on it, upload it through that and then download some sort of ssh client, ssh into the server with the details your host should of provided you with.</p>
<p>Once you’re connected with your ssh client, type in “cd /the/name/of/the/directory/you/uploaded/your/server/to/” then type “java server”.<br>
kdone.</p>

<p>Quite honestly, you cant run your sever on it. Its not possible. You would have to have access to the server directly in order to do it, which you do not. and you dont have access to the server folders (not by means of ftp or cPanel) so you couldnt run it through there.

<p>actually, when you have a dedicated server, you dont have full access to it…i know because i have had them. you cant run anything you want on it. you have access over the web, which isnt like having access in a normal way. its really not the same.</p>

<p>Right, firstly, you can run your server on it, you thick shit.</p>
<p>Secondly, you do also connect it it, you thick shit.</p>

<p>Fourthly,  “I dont know why everybody wants to get a dedicated server…Just because Miss Silabsoft got one, doesnt mean everybody else should because”, i’ve never heard so much shit in my life. Firstly it’s “why do you make client wit da silab item silab did it first na na na” when they’re blatently jagex items, and now you can’t buy a dedicated server because silabsoft bought one? get a fucking grip ffs. NO ONE IS NOW ALLOWED TO HOST A FORUM BECAUSE MOPARISTHEBEST DID IT FIRST</p>

<p>why the fuck would i suck up to silab?</p>
<p>no shit you connect to it…how the fuck else do you think ur gonna put shit on it?</p>
<p>if you can run a server on it, give me a full explanation on how.</p>

<p>redhat doesnt have the ability to be controlled remotely. jesus fucking christ, learn something.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: January 08, 2008, 02:11:30 PM[/size][hr]i think i should elaborate on why you cant control it like a regular computer.</p>
<ol>
<li>if you could run anything you want on it, a hacker can get control and run a batch script to wipe it, and annihilate the server so it becomes unusable.</li>
<li>if you had full access, you could install anything you wanted on it, which could compromise the integrity of the server farm.</li>
<li>all one has to know is the ip address and then from that they could find the ip block and take down every server through scripts run on the server. and it would look like the renter did it. it would cost the company hundreds of thousands of dollars, and who would they blame? YOU!</li>
<li>they wouldnt allow you to run batch scripts on it for the reason that you could mess with the server that other customers might use down the road.</li>
<li>you could access the bios and screw it up</li>
<li>you could fuck with the os’ files and blame it on the host and sue them</li>
<li>you could take down the whole server farm’s internet connection</li>
<li>you could place malicious code in the files for the os and customers that use it down the road could be hacked and so could their customers</li>
<li>even if they wiped the drive and reinstalled the os, it would be possible to make an entry in the bios to add whatever code you want into the os that gets installed next</li>
<li>it would be just fuckin stupid if the hosting company let you have complete control, or even enough control, to run anything on it except normal web related things</li>
</ol>
<p>are those enough reasons? or do you want more?</p>

        <p>Oh god robocz033 you are fucking retarded, you obviously did not rent out a dedicated server. Most dedicated server packages give you full root access to the server.<br>
Red hat linux has ssh == remote access, it shows how much you know when you just said “i would write a batch file to wipe everything”. Yeah good luck when linux does not even run “batch files” you stupid cunt.</p>
<p>A dedicated server is a server YOU rent out for YOURSELF, no other people are on it. Its basically like renting a house except they are keeping it at their datacenter.</p>
<p>You are obviously getting mixed up with something else.</p>
