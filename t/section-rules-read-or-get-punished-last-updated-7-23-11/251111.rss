    <description>There are several modifications to the rules, as well as a reformatting. Due to such changes, the new rules are being posted here instead of being updated in the old topic.

[b]All[/b] of the following rules *must* be followed while posting in this section. Failure to do so will result in a lock and possible warnings or moderations.

[b][u][size=11pt]1.[/size][/u][/b] All topics in this section [b]must[/b] be requests for help on a [b]server[/b]. Any non-server related questions will be locked. [u]Requesting a host, &#39;coder&#39;/programmer, server or client, or asking about a VPS also falls under being non-server related. That means for other sections on this site too.[/u]

[b][u][size=11pt]2.[/size][/u][/b] All topic bodies must follow [url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,267609.0.html]this post[/url].

[b][u][size=11pt]3.[/size][/u][/b] We are [b]not[/b] a [url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/spoonfeeding]Spoonfeeding[/url] community. We do [b]not[/b] teach in an oversimplified manner to discourage independent thought. We [b]encourage[/b] independent thought, meaning you must help yourselves before requesting help. Failure to provide some sort of [b]prior knowledge or work to the problem[/b] will result in a lock of the topic. This is final.

[b][u][size=11pt]4.[/size][/u][/b] Excessive spamming or flaming, as a rule of thumb, will result in one to two week warnings or moderations. Repetitive excessive flaming will result in worse punishments. This means, the more posts full of excessive flaming there are in the topics, the worse each punishment will be individually. Same applies to spamming.

[b][u][size=11pt]5.[/size][/u][/b] Make sure the titles of your topics are easy to read and are completely relevant to the topic at hand. Though this rule may be bent from time to time, make sure you follow it. A moderator on a bad day could easily lock a topic for breaking this rule.

[b][u][size=11pt]6.[/size][/u][/b] Advertising is [u]strictly[/u] forbidden in this section [b]AND[/b] all others. Multiple advertising will result in a mute or a ban as advertising is getting out of hand. Take it to the Server Status page located [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/serverstatus.php]HERE[/url].

[b][u][size=11pt]7.[/size][/u][/b] Offering a reward for someones help [i]is not[/i] allowed, help is free on this community. 

All the above rules may change time to time. The above rules are not exact, they are mere center guidelines for moderators. A moderator is not required to reply to a topic they locked, though they are encouraged to. The above are also mere major rules that apply throughout the section, but if a moderator has their own reason in locking a topic, so may it be.

[quote=&quot;Tico&quot;]A large majority of topics in this section are not explained very well, easily seen by the first few posters asking to elaborate.  From now on, if you fail to be as specific as possible, your topic may be locked.  It is a complete waste of time for those who are trying to help if they have to post asking for you to elaborate.  So, if it means pictures, samples of code, and anything else you believe may be helpful to people who are trying to answer your question.

Just remember, the better you explain the problem you are experiencing, the better quality the replied posts will be, and the faster your issue will be resolved.[/quote]
