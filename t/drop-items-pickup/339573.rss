    <title>Drop items pickup</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/drop-items-pickup/339573</link>
    <description>Alright I am using Pimpscape base.
Say multiple items have been dropped on the ground and they stack up.
If you you pick up one of those several items it&#39;ll delete all the other items under it..

say there were a few sharks on the ground, about 5
you pickup 1 shark and all the sharks delete from the ground??

Does anyone know how to fix this??
