    <title>[508] Commands, Help me Please</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-commands-help-me-please/346419</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

Finnally got my 508 up and going, Changed names, changed some other things but now I want to add some commands,

I open up comands.java but I can see a logical structure (which has to be there like : Player,Mod,admin commands)

So I try to figure out were to put player commands and I can find it so I guessed somethign and when compiling got like 100 errors...

So now I was wondering if someone could explain to me how to add player/mod/admin/owner commands or if someone could just send me a command.java with the commands I want ?

Thanks already guys

              <p>i am having the exact same problem.  I get 100 errors no matter what I do to try and fix it.<br>
The error reads for all of them<br>
cannot find symbol symbol cmd and here are some commands</p>
<p><code>if (cmd[0].equals("male")) {
				p.look[0] = 3;
				p.look[1] = 10;
        			p.look[2] = 18;
        			p.look[3] = 26;
        			p.look[4] = 33;
        			p.look[5] = 36;
        			p.look[6] = 42;
                    		p.gender = 0;
				p.appearanceUpdateReq = true;
				p.updateReq = true;
			} </code></p>

              <p>Can you upload a part of your commands.java (Include at least 3 commands and then tell me what other commands you want adding?)<br>
Cheers bro.</p>
