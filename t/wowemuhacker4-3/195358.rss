What it has:
Hunter Tracking             : When enabled to whatever setting you choose you will be able to track things like hunters do.
Herbs/Minerals/Treasure     : When enabled to whatever setting you choose you will be able to find herbs, Minerals, Treasure etc.
Speed Hack                  : There are different settings for speed as well as a &quot;User Input&quot; Mode which you can set your own.
Wall Climb  On/Off          : When Enabled this will allow you to Climb up Walls.
Fall Damage On/Off          : Turns off Fall Damage.
Teleport to Plane           : This function makes you invisible to any NPC or PC, you even disappear from their radar if they could track you. You warp to a plane where no one can touch you nor can you touch anyone. It&#39;s abit hard to navigate so I suggest you use the mini map for that.
Fly Mode                    : Lets you fly as if you where a GM with .fly mode on (like swimming in the air)
Levitate                    : Lets you Levitate you can go over water and you fall slower.
Normal                      : Default movement state (walking normal)
Gravity                     : Lets you alter the Gravity. This allows you to jump higher and so on etc. I Strongly suggest you use no fall damage with this as you might find your self suffering massive damage.
Teleport                    : You can add locations and select locations to teleport to. I Suggest you try and keep the teleports in between about half of the map to avoid possible problems. 
*                           : Places the current Location in to the Teleport Box&#39;s.
Corpse                      : When dead it will teleport you to your corpse  or try to.
Spirit                      : When dead it will teleport you to the spirit healer.
Allow Model Hacks           : To use this, you must start WoWEmuHacker before you log-in and enable this feature. If your default char is not
                              The model which you are editing you can enable the feature before entering the realm. I strongly suggest enabling before
                              you log-in to avoid any client problems that might arise if it detects patch.mpq&#39;s it does not agree with.
No Clip                     : When Enabled you can use the defined hotkey to inch your self forward into objects/Through walls etc.

P to P Teleport             : This feature is for use in close range teleporting. You can setup 3 locations
                              by using the Defined hotkeys and then teleporting by using defined hotkeys
                              Main uses are for PVP or kiting.

Water Breathing             : As the name says this option will allow you to breath underwater. This option also enables you to stay mounted in water.
                              You Might also find this option allows you to do some other things as well.

No Global CoolDown          : This option has had alot of demand. This option removes on spells&amp;attack skills the global 2.x second cooldown
                              in effect this allows you to chain cast insta spells. Example: Ice Lance.
                              
Get Loc                     : I have been ware of a bug which has caused WoWEmuHacker to randomly Crash after zoning etc, So I have removed the auto updated
                              Current Loc function, and replaced it with a Get Loc button. I figure that the avg player does not just sit around 
                              watching the numbers anyway. Hit this button, and it will return your current location.

Speak In                    : Select the language you want from the list and all you chat text will be in that language.


Controls : 
List                          : Opens up the teleport list dialog box.
Select Process          : Use this when you have started WoWEmuHacker before starting wow to select the process. *Note: This is not needed if you are starting wow using the &quot;Start WoW&quot; Option*
Start WoW               : Use this if you need to launch wow patched for Model Hacks/Edits. It will start the wow.exe you select and patch it before it starts up. Ideal for DBC type model edits.
Setup HotKeys         : WoWEmuHacker allows you to setup hotkeys to do a wide array of things, and to control WEH options, from here you can setup your keys.
Help                        : As the name says it will display a help box with info such as posted above.
