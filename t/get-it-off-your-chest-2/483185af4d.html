        <p>I love how everybody is downing on Ruby for liking to drink. I got about $700 in tickets 3 days ago and what did I did? I got home and got drunk. Sadly, it took 2 fifths of Vanilla Vodka to do that, and my head was still on straight (i could speak fine, program fine, just couldnt walk for shit).</p>
<p>Everybody who drinks knows that its not going to make your problems go away, but what it does help you do is forget about them or not give a shit about them anymore. Thats exactly what it did for me, helped me not give a fuck that I had just gotten handed tickets worth more than I make in 3 months. Dont talk shit on anybody for drinking, you can know alot about them, but do you truely know them? Many people have things they hide inside.</p>

        <p>Ok I’m a coward because I advised people to rather than mope around to go and do something about their problems. Not really a fair accusation. Considering when I was heavily hitting the drink I had just split up with my long-term girlfriend, I don’t know a guy who doesn’t do that.

No, I draw the line fucking there. You didn’t know me in real life and you certainly didn’t know her. We were great for each other, my online personality is completely different to who I am in real life. This isn’t personal, this isn’t about me and you’ve done nothing but single me out. You can fuck right off. Things were bad for a while but if we stuck at it it could’ve been fixed, you don’t know the ins and outs, get to fuck. You have no fucking right to say anything of the sort.</p>
<p>If you don’t know two people don’t you fucking dare sit there and judge them. I hit drink after that because I was in a bad place. I’ll do what the fuck I want and when the fuck I want to. I wasn’t judging anyone, I wasn’t directly saying anything to anyone and you’ve even brought people who meant the world to me into a fucking online community. You’re bang out of order and you need to take a fucking look at what you’re saying.</p>

<p>If you feel bad for saying it that probably means you should keep your mouth shut. What if he started throwing problems you have out in the open? Would kind of piss you off and hurt a bit. That was messed up of you to say…</p>

        <p>No point in changing the subject now that you’ve already started shit</p>
<p>This ladies and gentlemen is why you shouldn’t usually add people from online to your Facebook. When they’ve nothing to say back to you they’ll just bring some form of your IRL trouble that they seen happen on there into it and throw it in your fucking face.</p>

I don’t have any problems I haven’t already come to terms with. If you can’t deal with your problems, you might as well accept them and let them be. It’s kept me pretty peaceful.<br>

<p>Ok I’m a coward because I advised people to rather than mope around to go and do something about their problems. Not really a fair accusation. Considering when I was heavily hitting the drink I had just split up with my long-term girlfriend, I don’t know a guy who doesn’t do that. It’s also a way of life for most in my country, if you pick 9/10 Scotsmen I can guarantee they like to have a drink and most drink Friday through Saturday and usually on a Wednesday.</p>
<p>I do what I like to do, you’re making it out like I didn’t have a hard time lol. I worked hard through my life as I always had to do, just because I’m doing well now and my family are very well off now doesn’t mean it wasn’t bad in the past.</p>
<p>I thought we were better than this, Justin. I really did. Not really a very fair to call me out directly as a heavy drinker.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It is fair. Also, you and your girlfriend weren’t a very good couple. I do feel bad for saying this, but she wasn’t great for you, so I don’t see why you would’ve had to drink after that relationship.</p>
<p>Honestly I see the equivalent of drinking heavily as doing drugs to blur out the world.<br>
[/quote]<br>
No, I draw the line loveing there. You didn’t know me in real life and you certainly didn’t know her. We were great for each other, my online personality is completely different to who I am in real life. This isn’t personal, this isn’t about me and you’ve done nothing but single me out. You can love right off. Things were bad for a while but if we stuck at it it could’ve been fixed, you don’t know the ins and outs, get to love. You have no loveing right to say anything of the sort.</p>
<p>If you don’t know two people don’t you loveing dare sit there and judge them. I hit drink after that because I was in a bad place. I’ll do what the love I want and when the love I want to. I wasn’t judging anyone, I wasn’t directly saying anything to anyone and you’ve even brought people who meant the world to me into a loveing online community. You’re bang out of order and you need to take a loveing look at what you’re saying.[/quote]</p>

        <p>I moved to this school a while ago, but I’ve barely made any friends.  The only ‘real’ friend I have is a kid named Scott.  My other ‘friends’ are his friends, and they’re all annoying as hell.  I only hang out with them so that people won’t make fun of me for being alone, like they did freshman year and Sophomore year, (I’m currently a junior).  At the start of summer 2012, I decided that Junior and Senior year would be different.  I wouldn’t eat lunch alone, and I wouldn’t deal with being made fun of. (Just for the record, I was never made fun of to my face.  It was always people laughing at me when they thought I wasn’t listening).  At the start of the year, I met Scott and things started to go great.  I finally had a group of people to eat lunch with, rather than by myself, or with people who would overflow from their crowded table.  But that group of people I eat with, I hate.  I hate all of them except for Scott, so half of the time I just go eat in the ‘Eagle’s Nest’, which is an open area on the third floor where clubs meet after school.  [size=3pt]And it’s called that because we’re the eagles.  [/size]  I feel like next year is going to be just the same as freshman and Sophomore years were though.  Scott and his friends are all Seniors and they’ll graduate in a few months.  I never go out.  Must 16 year olds are out going to parties, or atleast at their friends houses playing games, but I just sit in my living room and watch TV.  Or watch shows on my Kindle until I fall asleep.  I don’t really want to be out with people during the day, because I like the night time better, so this one is entirely my fault.  I could be out with my friend after school, but I get up at 3am, so I’m usually pretty tired.  I feel like my life isn’t going anywhere.  I’m finishing high school in one and a half years, and still have no clue what I want my career to be.  None of the classes at my school interest me, and most things I’m only entertained by for a few months before I get bored and get back into the rut I’m in now. My GPA is terrible, so the odds of me getting into a decent college are slim.  And I’m not very good at anything.  My parents constantly tell me how they hate their jobs, and how I have to do something I enjoy as I career.  But I don’t enjoy doing anything.  I don’t drown my problems in alcohol.  And I don’t smoke weed or anything, anymore.  And I’m not looking for advice.  <span class="bbcode-b">[size=14pt]I know my problems aren’t bad compared to alot of people, and I’m not looking to be judged by anyone. I just felt like writing this.[/size]</span></p>
