    <description>ok then i downloaded hamchi like 1 week ago..
people play on my server .... now when i open it up..

it laggs and i cant use anything..  and it goes [not respodning].. i hope you had this same problem and u know how to fix it?
well if you do my server will be able to get back up again...  then i will make you co-owner..
