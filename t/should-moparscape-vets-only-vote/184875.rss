    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/should-moparscape-vets-only-vote/184875</link>
    <description>That seems more legitimate than me than allowing Community Members from moparisthebest.com in on the vote, however MoparScape Vets that were upgraded to community member such as Miss Silabsoft for instance will still be allowed to see and participate in these votes.

(both user groups will still see the vet talk section)

I will only take into account opinions from MoparScape Vets on this, which is why I did not put a poll.</description>

<p>I don’t think that’ll happen. Not like you’re expecting it to, at least.</p>
<p>Most of the people that are/have been Vets are well aware of what happened with the rep when the Moparscape CM rank still existed.<br>
I’m sure that the current Vets will maintain a highly conservative approach when inducting new members into their ranks.</p>
<p>The only problem is that a few of them nominate people simply because they’re their friends.<br>
I hope that the members I’m referring to here (and I’m sure they know who they are) will choose to nominate based on ability, rather than inability paired with friendship.</p>

<p>That is not the point Yz. The point is, is that you all should be working together as one team, not fighting with each other about which rank is better. I don’t care which rank is better, and you shouldn’t either. This is just an argument that has gone on too long.</p>

              <p>Some how this topic was turned into a topic about whos a moparscaper and who isn’t. That really should not be an argument, especially since you are either a CM or Vet. I, and probably everyone would agree that discussions should be a lot more meaningful then this has become. Sorry if I’m sounding like a bit of a dick, but it’s true. Members of such a high class as yourselves should be setting examples for the other members, and acting responsibly.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think these types of arguments are because one rank is better then the other rank. Neither rank is better, they are both equal (CM and Vet) it’s just how you look at it. Of course CM’s will say CM is better, and Vet’s will say Vet is better. It’s just an opinion, and people should not be judged by that kind of rank. The entire staff ('m including CM’s and Vet’s when I say this) should act as a team together, and not trying to start fights with other people.</p>
<p>So please, lets keep this type of thing out of future discussions, it gets us no where, and fighting over which rank is better is just a waste of time. You are one team, act as a team, or stay out of discussions.</p>
