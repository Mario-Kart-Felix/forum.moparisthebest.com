    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/very-anoying/41785</link>
    <description>a few days ago i bought a mp3,but when i got home and tried to turn it on, it didnt work.The next day i went to the store , gave it back and got my money back.
Later on that day i went to another store and bought a Sony mp3, but this time the mp3 did work but the program that i had to install on my computer didnt.
basically whenever you need to put songs in your mp3 you first need to convert it into Astrac.
i used the program SonicStage wich is a fucking stupid program that cant do shit!!!
when i want to put something like 10 songs in my mp3 ,5 of the 10 songs wont get in because it couldnt get converted.
the next day i want to put more songs into it but then it says i had to delete all songs , so i delete all songs and try to put other songs into it, but as you might&#39;ve guessed , it didnt work.

from then i did some google searches that said i need to install sp2 or update my windows.
Ofcourse installing Sp2 didnt work and neither did the updating
i tried reinstalling that shitty Sonicstage over and over again, but it&#39;s still the same.
I tried updating it, but still the same.

Now im really close into throwing my computer along with my mp3 or walkman(or however you call it) out of the window.

My question is : can anyone help me with this?or does anyone know if there is any other program then Sonicstage?

any help is really apreciated</description>

<p>You guys should both go get a Zune. There made by Microshit, but there good. The graphics are like better than a HDTV, and you get radio and 30gb of space and video and music and pictures, and you can set your own background, which I thought was pretty cool.</p>

              <p>a few days ago i bought a mp3,but when i got home and tried to turn it on, it didnt work.The next day i went to the store , gave it back and got my money back.<br>
Later on that day i went to another store and bought a Sony mp3, but this time the mp3 did work but the program that i had to install on my computer didnt.<br>
basically whenever you need to put songs in your mp3 you first need to convert it into Astrac.<br>
i used the program SonicStage wich is a fucking stupid program that cant do shit!!!<br>
when i want to put something like 10 songs in my mp3 ,5 of the 10 songs wont get in because it couldnt get converted.<br>
the next day i want to put more songs into it but then it says i had to delete all songs , so i delete all songs and try to put other songs into it, but as you might’ve guessed , it didnt work.</p>
<p>from then i did some google searches that said i need to install sp2 or update my windows.<br>
Ofcourse installing Sp2 didnt work and neither did the updating<br>
i tried reinstalling that shitty Sonicstage over and over again, but it’s still the same.<br>
I tried updating it, but still the same.</p>
<p>Now im really close into throwing my computer along with my mp3 or walkman(or however you call it) out of the window.</p>
<p>My question is : can anyone help me with this?or does anyone know if there is any other program then Sonicstage?</p>
<p>any help is really apreciated</p>
