Welcome to Legit-Rune, A server that is 100% LEGIT about runescape.
Our aim is to focus on our players and their needs. Out motto is &quot;You Pay, YOU SAY!&quot;.

The server was released in September 2012, by Owner Felix and his devoted moderation/administration team.

The server is best known for its 100% Runescape Minigames (IE: Castle Wars). Although some of our players are not in to that, they are more of the Skilling type. So we have developed a ratio of 9:10 WORKING skills, that you can train.
