    <title>Project Insanity Remake (Had to quit) (Fixed Lunars)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-insanity-remake-had-to-quit-fixed-lunars/451277</link>
    <description>[size=14pt]Well me and my friend Sam were wanted to have a server to play &amp; pk on &amp; shit. So I decided since I&#39;m decent with PI&#39;s we should play on an oldschool PI for fun... But I recently found out that in 2 days I&#39;m going to be going somewhere for a little under a month, so I&#39;m just going to release this.[/size]

[size=12pt]What I&#39;ve done:
Followed a bunch of tuts...
...
I barely did anything myself, used a tutorial for almost everything. But I did add a donator shop myself :D not really worth mentioning though.
So what was done:
Lunars Completely Fixed (to my knowledge)
Some commands shaped &amp; turned around...
Was probably given about 5 or so warnings in eclipse. L[/size]

I originally used &#39;Project Insanity - Normal PI - All Dupes fixed.&#39; From &#39;Jack&#39; on RLocus.
Creds:
Sanity
Jinrake- rlocus
Robgob69- rlocus
Jake- rlocus
Me- .25% :)

Here&#39;s the download link. If any of you have any questions or need help setting it up, I&#39;ll be online for 2 more days, so go ahead and reply to this topic
