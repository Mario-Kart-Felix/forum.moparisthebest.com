How do I fix this so that it&#39;s &#39;Attack&#39; on top, &#39;Trade With&#39; 2nd, &#39;Follow&#39; 3rd and &#39;Walk Here&#39; at the bottom?
Or even better, can someone post me some really sweet right click options? (no colour effects please)
Oh and I want the right click options to have rights so that anyone can use all of them</description>

How do I fix this so that it’s ‘Attack’ on top, ‘Trade With’ 2nd, ‘Follow’ 3rd and ‘Walk Here’ at the bottom?<br>
Or even better, can someone post me some really sweet right click options? (no colour effects please)<br>
