    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-not-connecting-to-server-lets-others-join-not-me/542949</link>
    <description>Hello moparscape my source and client havnt been letting me join server so i was using a diffrent client but now i added dung and construction to the skill tab so i dont want to have to add them agian in the other client.

The source is running perfectly portforweded correctly it also lets my friends on but for some reason im not allowed to get on i tought it might be a problem with my acc so i tryed logging in a new acc same thing happens and i check the bans and ip bans and im not listed in them so i dont know whats going on this started when i made the client connect to my ip.


thanks</description>
