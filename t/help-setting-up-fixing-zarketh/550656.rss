    <description>Thanks for viewing my thread. First off im trying to get the zarketh source functional at least so i log in. So if you know zarketh source;even better.My skype is Big_dizzy_420.I have all the Zarketh files aswell as the world(whether its right im not 100% sure.) but i do want to keep the login server and the sql setup. i have the mysql set up for the most part but i may hvae missed something(been up for 40 hours now wouldnt even doubt it. Please get back at me ASAP for more info. Thanks in advance. Spent multiple hours trying to figure this out. TBH Its prob something easy and im just to tired to see it. I dont get any compiling errors in the server or the login server. The client ip is 127.0.0.1 and i get no response from login server. I think it could be located in the world.java file but i cant be to sure. If your willing to help and possibly show me how to do it it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. Also if you need any specific files just let me know im to tired to upload.</description>
