    <title>Prayer Button Issue</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/prayer-button-issue/343674</link>
    <description>I am positive that this is a client related issue, due to the fact that I recently switched clients. I am satisfied with the new client, except for one issue-- none of the prayer buttons are working. The prayer buttons have no effect, and they don&#39;t drain my prayer whatsoever. I can even do this:

So does anyone have a solution to this problem. It would be incredibly helpful just to let me know which file contains the prayers. Please, anything, i&#39;m desperate for a solution.</description>

              <p>Actually, that issue is almost completely server sided.<br>
It appears that you have to write the entire prayer method, with prayer draining, switching, delays and effects, yourself.<br>
What source did you get that doesn’t have prayers down?</p>
