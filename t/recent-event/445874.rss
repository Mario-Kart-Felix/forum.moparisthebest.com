              <p>I was on when he was banned.<br>
It was a discussion and AGL was trolling trying to push Tomâ€™s buttons. Tom Banned him with good cause and now AGL is upset.<br>
He did bring this on himself, he likes to push the edge of trolling and all the long time players have gotten used to it.<br>
But you can see how new players can get upset as what regrettably happened to me and Meep.<br>
Its sad cause he is one of the most loyal player we have but I agree he need to be punished a bit.</p>
