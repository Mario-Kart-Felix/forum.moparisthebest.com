I assume they started doing behaviour analysis rather than client side stuff?<br>
[/quote]I don’t think many people really and truly know what they use anymore. Several people speculate though.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be surprised if they use some of both tactics.[/quote]I’ll bother contributing something since I have been spamming for the past three months.</p>
<p>[hr]</p>
<p>The biggest issue in botting is what we program our scripts to do: perform a task. All jagex does is detect those who do the same task over and over using the same steps. What we need to do is: emulate the user. How can they detect a user from a user? They can’t.</p>
<p>One way would be to tell the user to do the task legit for 20-30 minutes, generate parameters based on what you have recorded from them [clicks, delays, etc], then perform that task. I’d hazard to guess that this is banproof assuming the bot itself isn’t detected/somebody in-game doesn’t get you banned.</p>
<p>Some things which get bots banned:<br>
Obscure mouse movements - random zigzagging in an attempt to simulate whatever the fudge these dumbasses think they are. Make mouse movements less circular, they should be streamlined with a couple of points of deviation from the main course (obviously not a damn straight line).<br>
Stop moving the mouse off screen to simulate AFK behaviour, by using all 4 corners of the fudgeing applet - what does that even show? Do you really run rs like this?<br>
<img src="http://sc-cdn.scaleengine.net/i/a43617d37685d16beb11acacdb56b6211.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Simulate afk behaviour by moving towards one side of the screen only (preferably left or right, i’d say go for right since most people are right-handed and if they’re using a split-screen their other content probably tends to the right? - may be the inverse)<br>
Excessive mouse movements - when skilling (3-4 yrs ago) i only rly moved my mouse to continue the task not for the ‘fun’ of it (or in this case, making ourselves look like bots)<br>
Camera movements - if you’re cooking why do you even adjust the camera? all you end up doing is making it obvious you’re botting<br>
Botting for 3 days in a row at the same place<br>
If when performing a task you aren’t with the ‘crowd’, ie if when cooking this scenario occurs, you can safely assume person a is botting - clearly path finding is at work here or social autism - easier to spot outsiders &amp; some may notice your bot is breaking (if you stand around still for too long)<br>
<img src="https://sc-cdn.scaleengine.net/i/fdebdb4b0f797e46399c9fe4b1502610.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
Dont use any public script, they probably have script analysis in place since jacmob had the source of like 40 of the ‘best’ scripts (i.e. distinct things they each do)<br>
Don’t interact/move towards/etc something without seeing it in your view port first, this doesnt mean snap your camera to the desired target and proceed - simulate ‘random’ camera movements until you find it (i.e. hold down left/right key and stop a little after you see it, allow some reaction time)<br>
Simulate user tireness, delay in reaction times etc after a while, perhaps less for skills where you can see the timers (i.e. cooking, 50s left till load is done since you can account for it and ‘return’ in time)<br>
Don’t bot places where you’re a <code>target</code> to others, i.e. frosts - since you are competition, dumb 10yos will report you just in hopes of trimming it down whether youre botting or not<br>
risky: implement speech response, why is this risky? if you get asked something the bot cannot handle then you have been exposed rofl (unless if you say some shit like brb which will become obvious to legit users, as you keep saying it whenever you get asked a certain phrase), maybe just use quick chat to answer 1-2 WHAT IS UR LEVEL GUISE a day<br>
Moving the camera to dumb angles due to random.next then snapping it to an object to interact with it - such a giveaway<br>
detect people who say they have high levels and use the new examine feature on them once in a while??<br>
dont hover skill xp that is just fudgeing dumb<br>
super hard mode: make a ‘chain of conversation’ and link 2 bots together, then have them respond to each other like once every 1-2 minutes - this will probably get you far if you randomise the conversation and it makes sense, i.e. you write it up yourself</p>
<p>Kind of common sense but whatever lol.<br>
ps no incentive for anyone to bot since the game is<br>
a) shit<br>
b) gold is worth nothing<br>
c) all of above</p>
<p>note may be typos or you may not agree with all of them - welcome to not being a sheep</p>

I mean, there’s the isolated pockets of the ‘community’ like the RSBot developers, but other than that we don’t have people on here doing stuff anymore, or Freddy’s old forum which was always full of keen folk, etc. Is it just a case of the new wave of people not knowing their hand from their foot, or does nobody just care? Because the former problem can be fixed, lol.</p>
