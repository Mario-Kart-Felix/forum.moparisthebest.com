    <description>hey guys i am wondering for this fuction

EstimateDist(Steps: integer; Direction: String): integer;
how would i set it up so it can walk about 30 steps south?

an also is there a better function to use?

i am not that good at scar an i would really like to get good at it so i can contribute more.

thanks for reading this

          <blockquote>
              <p>I copied this from a previous thread where I explained it. In my opinion, you should use RadialRoadWalk. If you are not using colors however, then skip this part of the explanation.</p>
<p>RadialRoadWalk(RoadColor, StartRadial, EndRadial, Radius, XMod, Ymod);</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">RoadColor:</span> Pretty self exlpanitory. Make sure you have the script or user Get the RoadColor somehow.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">StartRadial:</span> The MiniMap is like a circle, and that is how RadialRoadWalk works. 0 degrees is the top, 90-east, 180-North, 270-West. The start radial is where you want the script to start looking for the RoadColor. For our example, we will say you are walking East. So we are gonna make a StartRadial of about 70 (MiniMap autorotates, so its not perfectly 90 for better finding.)</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">EndRadial:</span> Where you want the script to stop searching for the RoadColor. Since we are walking east, lets have the EndRadial 105.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Radius:</span> Radius is how far out you want the script to look for the RoadColor. For long distance walking (Lumbridge to Draynor on the open Road,) I use 45-50. However, when I have the script going by a bank, I don’t want to overshoot it, so I use about 30-35 for short walking. For our example we will use 40.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">XMod, YMod:</span> These are not very important, and I have not perfected them, but I know what they do. Xmod, and Ymod are the distance you want to move your mouse in Pixels if the flag does not show up. They work together to make different angles. YOu would keep these at 0,0 if you don’t want the mouse to move if the flag does not appear, it will just keep clicking in the same spot. They range from -1,-1 to 1,1. We will use 0,0 for our example.</p>
<p>Our example for walking east, searching for the RoadColor from 70 to 105 at a radius of 40.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">RadialRoadWalk(RoadColor, 70, 105, 40, 0, 0);</span></p>
<p>If you wanted to search for the RoadColor from 105 to 70 all you have to do is spot them around like this:<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">RadialRoadWalk(RoadColor, 105, 70, 40, 0, 0);</span></p>
<p>There is also a LinearRoadWalk, it is the same as RadialRoadWalk, except it walks the excact angle given on the RoadColor. it is good for getting out of places with lots of RoadColor, such as falador.</p>
<p>Both of them, at loading screens, check to see if there is a new RoadColor, and will automatically replace the RoadColor with it. Jagex made it so at every loading screen just the RoadColor changes, but Fakawi was able to master walking, and create this.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Alright, if you just want to click a couple pixels below the center use this, I just whipped it up, Pretty simple (MUST HAVE SRL):</span></p>
<p>[code]procedure MouseMMCenter(Direction : string; Pixels :Integer; XMod, YMod :Integer);<br>
var MMCX2, MMCY2, Cu :Integer;<br>
begin<br>
Direction:=Lowercase(Direction);<br>
if Direction = ‘n’ then MMCY2 := MMCY - Pixels;<br>
if Direction = ‘w’ then MMCX2 := MMCX - Pixels;<br>
if Direction = ‘s’ then MMCY2 := MMCY + Pixels;<br>
if Direction = ‘e’ then MMCX2 := MMCX + Pixels;</p>
<pre><code>MouseFindNoFlag(MMCX2, MMCY2, XMod, YMod);
</code></pre>
<p>end;[/code]</p>
<p>Alright, so you enter the Direction you want the Mouse to click beyond the center of the MiniMap. You would enter this for your request:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">procedure MouseMMCenter(‘S’, 3 + Random(2), 0, 1); </span></p>
<p>If you need any explaining on this, or XMod, Ymod or anything, just ask. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>If you don’t have SRL I can make a different one.</p>

              <p>Well, I’m not exactly sure what you’re asking for, but for mapwalking I’d try RRW ( Radial Road Walk ), its a great function, you can find a tutorial on it over at villu. I could direct you there, if you’d like.</p>
