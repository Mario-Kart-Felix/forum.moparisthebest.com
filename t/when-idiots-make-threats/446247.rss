&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/snip&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#39;m not very concerned about this incident, but how likely is it to shut down a webhost?</description>

              <p>As much as I agree with moparisthebest, as your server gets more popular, you will get more and more ddos threats, in my opinion, the best thing to do in the situation is to simply remain calm, talk to them and get them to calm down. Gage their maturity. If they are really immature there are 2 main possible outcome. 1. they have no idea what they are doing and want free items. 2. they know what they are doing and either want something or want to piss you off. so you have a couple options, 1. try and calm them down and get them “on your side” 2. give them what they want so they’ll shut up. or 3. you can freak out on them and then they post on badsite that your a jerk and some 12 year old will ddos you for a few days.</p>
<p>In short… Don’t be a dick, talk to the players, even the annoying ones.</p>
<p>Why, just the other day someone told me they where gonna ddos me with “10gb/s 100 000 hosts”  :rolleyes:</p>
<p>even though i knew he had no idea, i still talked to him to be certain. turned out he had a bunch of friends who play rsps’ and by being friendly with him, i gained over 10 daily players, just like that. just something to keep in mind.</p>
