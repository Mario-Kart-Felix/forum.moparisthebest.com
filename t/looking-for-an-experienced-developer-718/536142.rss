    <title>Looking for an Experienced Developer [718]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-an-experienced-developer-718/536142</link>
    <description>Hello.

I&#39;m looking for an experience developer that has been coding a decent time and actually knows what he&#39;s doing. I currently have 2 developers, but 1 of them isn&#39;t very active due to owning his own server. This server is going to be a PvP/PvM Server.

If you&#39;re interested please use this form:
[code]
How long have you been coding?
What experience do you have?
Are you currently busy with any other projects?
What is your age?
How do you handle stressful situations?
How long can you be on per day?
How well do you work with others?
Skype?
[/code]

Thank you.</description>
