    <title>Compile.bat not running my server, only running Testscape</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/compile-bat-not-running-my-server-only-running-testscape/42099</link>
    <description>Well, I fixed everything and got my Testscape account back (Mod_Kaine, which I made after I thought Testscape was MY server I made :P)

Unfortunately I lost 80% of the T-trail rune and d-armour I got. Oh well.

Now I&#39;m trying to get my server up and running

- Opened Hamachi, made a new network

[i]Hamachi Login
Name: KaineScape
Password: kainescaperules[/i]

- Ran Compile.bat
- It ran Testscape (maybe because it&#39;s in the Testscape source folder...)


What do I do to make it run MY server instead of Testscape?

I also need help with Aryan commands.

I&#39;ve found
::mod &lt;0 = Player, 1 = Player mod, 2 = Jagex mod&gt;
::emote &lt;insert number&gt; Most of the numbers you put in will make your char glitch out.

I wanna know if there are any J-MOD and P-MOD-only commands that Jagex themselves use when they&#39;re in the game.</description>

              <p>::emote doesn’t make your character ‘glitch out’, the most likely case is that you were using an emote ID that only NPCs usually use;</p>
<p>And to make it do your server, put the batch file in the same folder that your server is.</p>
<p>I know that Jagex uses the NPC commands, as well as ::noclip, then on RS everyone is like “WHAT THE FUCKING SHIT HOW ARE YOU AN NPC?@?@#?@#? OMGWTFBBQ”, poor idiots who know nothing about clients or servers …</p>
