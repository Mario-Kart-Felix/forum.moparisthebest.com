    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/learning-the-language-of-java/398290</link>
    <description>So, i decided its high time to actually learn a thing or two about java and how to code in it, i think the basic concept im grasping so far is that for each new addition to the language there is a new class, and in each class there are the ints or values? and the void, booleans etc.. umm
I&#39;m not a huge book learner, im not very good at learning by just reading im more of a hands on kind of person, so i was just wondering if anyone here thats experienced could write me out a couple of just simple voids or classes that have an error or two and i could go about trying to figure out whats wrong as kind of a trial and error thing.

anyways its much appreciated, sick of being a leecher.. trying to run a server that i dont know how to do much of anything on cause i dont really know the language.

thanks in advance to anyone who decides to help.

Trolls dont even bother, you arent welcome and you wont get a response or a rise outta me i&#39;m learning slowly but surely so just fuck off please :)</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>[quote=“object, post:5, topic:398290”]You could also think of a class as a blueprint of something. A class called “Car”, would be a basic blueprint for a car. An instance of this class (that is, an object created from this “Car” class), could be your car or your friends car (or any car in the world for that matter).</p>
<p>Now also, this “Car” class doesn’t say too much about the car. Is it a Volvo, a Toyota or perhaps a Ferrari? This is a very good place to declare the class abstract (in the case you have gotten this far in theory). Then you could create a new class for each brand with their own internal components. The class “Engine” could also be an abstract class, because as far as I know, all cars do have an engine of some kind. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>You could have used an interface instead of the abstract class. But if the abstraction itself knows something about the internals and they will never change, then an abstract class can take care of that for you. So you don’t have to reimplement it for each and every brand.</p>
<p>This way you’re creating abstractions on top of other abstractions. Abstractions allows you to express more with less - which is one of the things we want to achieve, because we’re lazy. :)[/quote]</p>
<p>this is kinda what they were saying in the object orented programming tutorial i was reading</p>
<p>this was their base example</p>
<p>[code=java]class Bicycle {</p>
<pre><code>   int cadence = 0;
   int speed = 0;
   int gear = 1;

   void changeCadence(int newValue) {
        cadence = newValue;
   }

   void changeGear(int newValue) {
        gear = newValue;
   }

   void speedUp(int increment) {
        speed = speed + increment;   
   }

   void applyBrakes(int decrement) {
        speed = speed - decrement;
   }

   void printStates() {
        System.out.println("cadence:"+cadence+" speed:"+speed+" gear:"+gear);
   }
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>This actually was a big help in understand btw so thank you</p>

It’s completely possible if you phrase your question in a coherent manor (and don’t mention <a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">this</a>).[/quote]</p>
<p>a coherent manor? surely you meant manner.</p>

              <p>You could also think of a class as a blueprint of something. A class called “Car”, would be a basic blueprint for a car. An instance of this class (that is, an object created from this “Car” class), could be your car or your friends car (or any car in the world for that matter).</p>
<p>Now also, this “Car” class doesn’t say too much about the car. Is it a Volvo, a Toyota or perhaps a Ferrari? This is a very good place to declare the class abstract (in the case you have gotten this far in theory). Then you could create a new class for each brand with their own internal components. The class “Engine” could also be an abstract class, because as far as I know, all cars do have an engine of some kind. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>You could have used an interface instead of the abstract class. But if the abstraction itself knows something about the internals and they will never change, then an abstract class can take care of that for you. So you don’t have to reimplement it for each and every brand.</p>
<p>This way you’re creating abstractions on top of other abstractions. Abstractions allows you to express more with less - which is one of the things we want to achieve, because we’re lazy. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>i try to think of each class as an object; then each object has it’s own functions (these are called methods in java). you may also want to look up oop (object orientated design) while it is not totally necessarily in smaller programs it will help in keeping larger ones cleaner and easier to update and manage.</p>

              <p>So, i decided its high time to actually learn a thing or two about java and how to code in it, i think the basic concept im grasping so far is that for each new addition to the language there is a new class, and in each class there are the ints or values? and the void, booleans etc… umm<br>
I’m not a huge book learner, im not very good at learning by just reading im more of a hands on kind of person, so i was just wondering if anyone here thats experienced could write me out a couple of just simple voids or classes that have an error or two and i could go about trying to figure out whats wrong as kind of a trial and error thing.</p>
<p>anyways its much appreciated, sick of being a leecher… trying to run a server that i dont know how to do much of anything on cause i dont really know the language.</p>
<p>thanks in advance to anyone who decides to help.</p>
<p>Trolls dont even bother, you arent welcome and you wont get a response or a rise outta me i’m learning slowly but surely so just fuck off please <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
