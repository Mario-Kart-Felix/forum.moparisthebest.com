    <title>Making Armor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-armor/380325</link>
    <description>We, as a community, should start making more armor. 95% of our models are weapons or capes and that&#39;s great if we&#39;re making good stuff but we should start using that talent to make custom armor. If someone could please upload or find a good tutorial for making custom armor in meta, blender, 3DS, whatever... We could all get good and we&#39;ll expand.</description>

IMO there should be more objects, armour is stupid because its either crap or crap because no-one here can model (excluding some people, who should know who they are by now)<br>
objects can be anything, from funky crates to new trees, even go as far as making whole house “kit sets” where you can piece together different walls in a editor and create whole new towns with compleatly cool new ideas[/quote]is it me…<br>
nah jokes I can’t model a pl8body for jackshit</p>

[/quote]Yeah, thats all you need. Seriously though, the best way to model something is to first sketch it out and go from there. Do what I do and create a wireframe on the sketch, draw the lines, and just model it by eyeballing it. The results turn out quite well.[/quote]<br>

<p>First of all, mironic isn’t provoking you in any way. If somehow, he is to you, then you obviously feel the need to accuse someone of this when things aren’t going your way in a discussion. And really, think about this. You want to import a character file (.mqo) into 3ds and build armor around that, right? Well if you can model, make armor on your own, the same way you would any other model. Then to import a model, export the .mqo character file to .3ds and import it into the 3DS program and go from there. Seriously, THAT IS ALL.</p>

<p>Hmm… That link helped a lot because I said “searching for a guide on how to make armor”. Makes sense because your link didn’t help me at all with making armors for rsps.

<p>We, as a community, should start making more armor. 95% of our models are weapons or capes and that’s great if we’re making good stuff but we should start using that talent to make custom armor.

<p>I made an armor set once. Then it came to animating it and I said “Fuck that”. Disappointed a decent amount of people when i never released it. Long story short: Fuck custom animating. Easy as it is, its not enjoyable. Of course this is coming from the views of someone who does not own nor play any RSPS and has a dislike for the manual animating of anything RSPS related.</p>

You come into OUR community and Tell us What to do… Lol.</p>
<p>its not that we dont know how to make armors its just that its unfun and un creative…</p>
<p>armors are really a basic shape… for all of them… weapons can be whatever your imagination can put to geather with a stander’d hilt. like i do helmets gloves boots objects npc’s and weapons becuase there fun</p>
<p>plate armor and legs are just boring so… Screw you ima stick to my plans.<br>

<p>I think one of the only reasons why armors are crap is because no one has anything to work off of. There aren’t any tutorials here so how would someone go about making armor sets if they don’t know what to do?</p>
<p>Your object modelling idea is interesting. Sounds good to me.[/quote]<br>
WRONG!<br>
I would like to see you make an armor with good imagination added to it. and im not talking about logo designs on it.</p>
<p>most armor designs have already been taken and therefor no imagination is needed to make armors.</p>
<p>Weapons on the other hand… are filled with new imagination and designs every time i come back here.</p>
<p>Everyone but you knows what i mean</p>

i am a object modeler XD…</p>
