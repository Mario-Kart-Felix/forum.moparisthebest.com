    <description>[center][size=18pt]&quot;SummerEnd&quot;[/size][/center]

Hello all I have now afk-time in summer, thought its been all summer holiday, because disease.
Anywhore, I have had long time in my mind to build own rsps and host it.
Well now came the right time and I&#39;m going to start making it today.
Would be nice if you just ignore my english. 

My java tree = [b]Delta [/b]-&gt; [b]PI [/b]-&gt; [b]bot [/b]-&gt; [b]PI[/b]

I have lot of idea in my head and if I don&#39;t turn crazy and all goes fine, then everything is fine.
My project idea is simple: PvP/ PvM &gt; economy &gt; Runescape stuff
So this is not like Runescape or another rspss.

[size=12pt]ToDo list:[/size]

[size=12pt]Done list:[/size]

Server name is still open but it will named before release.
Thought SummerEnd would have been good. but damn Jagex.

DAMN just remember what my bro said few weeks ago. Mod can close this. I&#39;m going to full code the server and then release. So good bye all and lets hope you find my server when its released. It will be &quot;epic land&quot;</description>
