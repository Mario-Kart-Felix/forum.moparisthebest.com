    <title>Activating PayPal</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/activating-paypal/375608</link>
    <description>Alright so I have money on my PayPal, enough to buy MineCraft and I don&#39;t want to ask my Dad for his Credit Card to activate purchasing, so does anyone know any methods of using fake generated credit cards (or something) so I can buy it?

I was originally going to ask someone to activate my paypal for me, then I&#39;ll buy minecraft and let them teamview or get on my paypal again to remove the credit card info.</description>

              <p>Only way to do it is use your phone to activate it. They have a $0.00 sending limit when it is not active.</p>

You can buy minecraft with a non-activated paypal, myns not activated. If you really want to activate it, order a Visa card from them.</p>
