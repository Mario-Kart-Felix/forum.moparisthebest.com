        <p>Hey mates,</p>
<p>Well, I have a few AP tests this week and next week. I’m kind of panicking…haven’t studied for any of the tests. Anyway, I know some people are taking AP tests and I just wanted to wish them the best.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">[size=12pt]Good luck![/size]</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u">Some tips</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Know the difference between a guess and an educated guess</span><br>
You won’t lose any points on the multiple-choice portion of your exam if you skip questions, but there will be a deduction for every question you answer wrong. If you can eliminate a few of the choices, try taking an educated guess.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Relax the night before the test</span><br>
Don’t cram. You are being tested on knowledge that you have accumulated over the course of the year.<br>
Studying at the last minute will only stress you out. Go to a movie or hang out with a friend - anything to get your mind off of the test!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Essays</span><br>
Only write as much as you have to say. There is no required length for the essays or short-answer questions on AP exams. The readers who score your exam are looking at whether you’ve developed a well-reasoned argument and whether you’ve presented it in an organized and coherent manner.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Sleep</span><br>
It is important to be well rested. Make sure to get a good night’s sleep in the few days before the test. If you don’t sleep well the night before the test, don’t worry about it! It is more important to sleep well two and three nights before. You should still have the energy you need to perform at your best.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Diet</span><br>
Don’t change your diet right before the test. Now’s not the time to try new foods, even if they are healthier. You don’t want to find out on test morning that yesterday’s energy bar didn’t go down well.<br>
In the few weeks before the test, try to work a light, healthy breakfast into your daily routine. If you already eat breakfast, good for you - don’t change a thing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Stress</span><br>
Try to be aware of whatever anxiety you’re feeling before test day. The first thing to remember is that this is a natural phenomenon; your body is conditioned to raise the alarm whenever something important is about to happen. However, because you are aware of what your body and mind are doing, you can compensate for it.<br>
Spend some time each day relaxing. Try to let go of all the pressures that build up during your average day.<br>
Visualize a successful test day experience. You already know what to expect on test day: when you’ll get each test section, how many questions there are, how much time you’ll have, etc. You also know where you are strong and where you are weak. Picture yourself confidently answering questions correctly, and smoothly moving past trouble spots - you can come back to those questions later. Find a family member or trusted friend with whom you can talk about the things that stress you out about the test. When this person tells you that everything is going to be OK, believe it!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Verbal Questions</span><br>
For passage-based questions, first work on detail questions that you can easily locate the answer to. Then move on to inference questions, questions that ask what the author intended, and main idea questions.<br>
If a question involves a tough vocabulary word, use the surrounding clues in the text to determine what it means.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Writing Questions</span><br>
Remember that a few spelling or grammar mistakes are tolerable, but you want to try to eliminate as many of those as you can. Try to vary your sentence length and word choice. Before you begin to write, spend a few minutes brainstorming ideas and outlining the argument you want to make. Planning will help you to write a well-organized and cohesive essay.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Practice and Review</span><br>
Whatever you do, don’t cram for the test! It is a bad strategy because you aren’t going to remember most of what you “learn” while cramming, and the odds are slim that the few things it will help you to remember will happen to be on the test. Save the energy you would have used to cram for test day. In the few days before the test, do a review of the skills and concepts in which you are strong. Be confident as you review everything that you know - and remember that confident feeling as you take the test.</p>
<p>I found these tips on the internet. Hopefully, they help.</p>
