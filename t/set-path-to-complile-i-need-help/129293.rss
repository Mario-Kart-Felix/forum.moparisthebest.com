    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/set-path-to-complile-i-need-help/129293</link>
    <description>Im pretty new i dont know much about coding or anything i know the basics, sorry if this is the wrong topic i have seen its disliked to be random  :P
I started editing and i realised that compiling was there, i tried to compile and i got a response that i needed jdk5 or 6 so i dled 6. I dont know where to set the path for the new jdk though. Im looking at it right now and i dont know what to do.my old path is still there.It sounds like a simple task but for me its a puzzle, cuz im slow :\
