    <title>50+ players with no lag?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/50-players-with-no-lag/101485</link>
    <description>Every time i look around on server advertisement, i see servers holding 40, 50 , 70, and ever 100 players+.... i go on theres is no lag, and its really fun.
But now i want to make my own server, this would be my 4th one. and i want it to stay for a long time, and have 50 players on with no lag.
But when i make mine, it lags with 8-20 players.
Any ideas on why i lag and others dont?
* things about my computer*
Its brand new, custem built computer,
It has 2 gigs of RAM, 222+ gigs of harddrive, (About 210gigs of freespace).
Also, i use charter highspeed internet, i have a router, but i dont use, because port forwarding never works, so i use modem only.
I also tired using hamchi only, still laggy, tried no-ip only, still laggy, tried them both, and yes, still laggy
Thanks
