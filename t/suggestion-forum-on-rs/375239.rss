    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/suggestion-forum-on-rs/375239</link>
    <description>idk if this has already been posted about. but i thought player suggestions from the runescape forum could be implemented into ps&#39;s. so if you are looking for ideas for your server there are some decent suggestions on their forums. when i start making either a ps or just a game i design. hope this is in the right section sorry if it isn&#39;t.

thought this might be useful to someone is why i posted.</description>
