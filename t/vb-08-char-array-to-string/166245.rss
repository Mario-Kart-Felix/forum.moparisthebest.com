    <title>[VB &#39;08] Char Array to String</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vb-08-char-array-to-string/166245</link>
    <description>Is there a quick way to convert a char array to a string? I am pretty new to Visual Basic, and I don&#39;t know if there is an easy way.

Also, I am making a brute forcer for a project. The char array is the password. How do I get the loop to increase the previous letter after a - z? So far, I have
[code=vb]
        For s As Integer = 5 To 20
            For i As Integer = 1 To 37
                Password(s) = Chars(i)
                Attempt = Attempt + 1
                txtHTML.Text = HTML
                strPass = Convert.ToString(Password) &#39;This line is trouble. strPass comes out literally as &quot;System.String[]&quot;
            Next
        Next
[/code]

I left out some code like the actual testing, but this is the basics of it. Am I doing something wrong, or is there an easier/quicker way?</description>
