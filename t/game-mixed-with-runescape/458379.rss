    <title>Game mixed with runescape?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-mixed-with-runescape/458379</link>
    <description>I was playing Skyrim, and was thinking what if RuneScape has some of the content from this game? Like the factions, skills, etc.
I would especially like mana.


I would like to know, what game would you like if it was mixed was runescape?

              <p>I think making good gear untradeable is a very bad move. 1: it pisses people off. 2: it takes away your freedom. 3: if you have no use for it then you should be able to get your money’s worth and 4: that’s what trading is for, and all obtainable items should be able to be distrubuted around the game otherwise it just becomes purely cosmetic and drains the fun out of it.</p>

              <p>I would love quests that had a great storyline into runescape, in Oblivion, I love the main storyline(Though it is short).<br>
But a main storyline in RuneScape may be a little to late now.</p>
<p>I liked the pharoah quests in runescape though, that was a great storyline.</p>

              <p>I’d like the leveling and skill system of RuneScape but tied up with some aspects of World of Warcraft, like dungeons, mounts, freewalking, and really good gear being untradable and earned through boss fights.</p>
<p>I’d like quests to be a mix as well, as in they still have nice storylines like RS, but they give good rewards (especially towards leveling) like WoW.</p>
<p>Really, there are things people would pick and choose from almost any MMORPG, so it’s hard to narrow it down <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>I plan to spend months on it so won’t be for a while. Basically think about when you are playing Skyrim. You always come across something of interest. There’s always a chest or something to pick up in your surroundings. There’s always something new top find, even if you’ve played the game for a long time. There’s always some type of diverse event that occurs at random.</p>
<p>That’s what I want to happen in the server. Every ladder, every door, every chest, every bookcase, every chest of drawers will be useful and contain things to do. Not just the same book for ever bookcase, or the same item in ever chest of drawers. Maybe sometimes there will be a key, or some gold, or something useful, or something rare to be obtained depending on where you are on the map. I still find it exciting playing Skyrim now not knowing what you’re going to find, and I’ve played it so much you think it would get old.</p>
<p>This will be the basis of my server. Always a sense of character growth.</p>
