    <title>Need someone to explain what is a null in server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-someone-to-explain-what-is-a-null-in-server/288324</link>
    <description>Ok I dunno if this is the right section but it seems to be the client that the items are nulls. (Defenders) Why does it come up as a null in the server? and how do I make it not?

thanks</description>
