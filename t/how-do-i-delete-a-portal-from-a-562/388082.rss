    <description>[center] :confused: [size=6]How Do I Delete A Object([/size][size=6]Portal[/size][size=6]) From A 562?[/size] :confused: 
[/center][center]Ok, so i recently was playing my Runescape Private Server and I found out that. Once you enter the edge-Vill Wilderness (Crossing The Ditch)  You cant get back over... So i decided to make a portal sense there was so many different portals in the object list I tryed them all till I found the right one, now i have like 5 portals that i need to get rid of. But I dont no where to do so. If There Is Anyone That Would Like To Help Me I will Put My 562 Server on Mopar so you guys can try it out.
