    <description>[center][IMG]http://i58.tinypic.com/v7ebns.png[/img][/center]



Beginnings:

Got a working door :) (check the date on the top right of the image to see when this was.
[IMG width=1000]http://i58.tinypic.com/1zl3y1f.png[/img]

When I first began I was working constantly on functionality (programming), not graphics.
[IMG width=1000]http://i62.tinypic.com/2cddhj6.png[/img]

Beginning-Middle:

Began touching graphics and made a really shitty house on Google Sketchup Pro. Still working on learning Blender to make models.
Also made my own scimitar, also on Google Sketchup Pro.

The inside of the house.

I also made a pause menu and a settings button, and credits page.
I also added collectible items that instantly exchange for its equivalent in gold coins.

Middle-Middle (current stage):

REALLY upped the graphics and map. Obviously this is not completely final, especially the house because this is way too small to be a level. Added the torch and weapon switching. Also added clouds and mist.
[IMG width=1000]http://i58.tinypic.com/vg3n7p.png[/img]

[IMG width=1000]http://i59.tinypic.com/otks5w.png[/img]

I added a human model of a guard, it&#39;s got animations for walking, running and idling. Need attack animation and death possibly.
[IMG width=1000]http://i58.tinypic.com/bhj7fc.png[/img]

This guard has a full waypoint system, it goes from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4+ and returns to zero when complete. Written entirely by me.
It also has a good AI but it needs plenty of bug fixes. It will walk toward me and attack me if I get into its collision box AND if it can see me (which means there is nothing obstructing it&#39;s view).

March 18, 2014:

This is the castle.

[IMG width=1000]http://i57.tinypic.com/33z3arp.png[/img]

I like this texture a lot.

[IMG width=1000]http://i59.tinypic.com/282q44m.png[/img]

Guard bedroom. (all these shitty models were made by me with trusty google sketchup pro)

TODO LIST:

Pause Menu - need to add loading and saving games later, at the end.

Weapon Switching - needs animation.

Better AI - needs small bug fixes and a warning system. Also need to add sound sensitivity and light sensitivity.

Decorations - furniture, collectibles and such distributed around the map.

NPC models - need better ones possibly, obviously this guard is not that amazing. Needs attack animation and edit the walk and run animations because they aren&#39;t perfect.

Level Design - I would like to make complex and well thought out thefts in large building and structures both above and below ground.

Multi-guard waypoint system - need to make compatibility with these waypoints. A different path for each guard, not gonna be hard to do at all.

Sound Effects - have added floor detection. On grass and gravel, footsteps sound like you are walking on grass or gravel and on wood or stone it sounds like you are walking on wood or stone. Need ambient sounds like in the forest and some light orchestral music to accompany the dark surroundings within the buildings.

<p>Oh! Thank you for clarifying. I’m not much of a story person, I’m going for more of a thief simulator style game. However you aren’t a petty thief. You are a thief that knows what he/she is doing. As for what you need to do in it, there will normally be a specific item you are after and you need to find that and get as much miscellaneous loot as possible to increase your “score” I’m assuming.</p>

<p>looks pretty cool. is Unity hard to work with? or do you think its much easier then java. Plus how long have you been developing with unity?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Unity is not hard to work with because it is easy to learn and understand how to use it because of it’s simple and effective layout and labeling all over. It supports the following languages: Javascript (what I use mostly), C Sharp, and Boo. It would be nice if they used java but hey, there has to be a reason why they aren’t. Also writing a 3D game from scratch on Java is intensely time consuming and difficult, Unity, being a game engine makes the game if you give it the ingredients (code and models).</p>
<p>I’ve been working with unity for a few months now.</p>

              <p>[center]<img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/v7ebns.png" alt width="" height="">[/center]</p>
<p>Beginnings:</p>
<p>Got a working door <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> (check the date on the top right of the image to see when this was.<br>
<img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/1zl3y1f.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>When I first began I was working constantly on functionality (programming), not graphics.<br>
<img src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2cddhj6.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Beginning-Middle:</p>
<p>Began touching graphics and made a really shitty house on Google Sketchup Pro. Still working on learning Blender to make models.<br>
Also made my own scimitar, also on Google Sketchup Pro.<br>
<img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/wv99ah.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The inside of the house.<br>
<img src="http://i60.tinypic.com/qnweqe.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I also made a pause menu and a settings button, and credits page.<br>
I also added collectible items that instantly exchange for its equivalent in gold coins.</p>
<p>Middle-Middle (current stage):</p>
<p>REALLY upped the graphics and map. Obviously this is not completely final, especially the house because this is way too small to be a level. Added the torch and weapon switching. Also added clouds and mist.<br>
<img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/vg3n7p.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/otks5w.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I added a human model of a guard, it’s got animations for walking, running and idling. Need attack animation and death possibly.<br>
<img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/bhj7fc.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>This guard has a full waypoint system, it goes from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4+ and returns to zero when complete. Written entirely by me.<br>
It also has a good AI but it needs plenty of bug fixes. It will walk toward me and attack me if I get into its collision box AND if it can see me (which means there is nothing obstructing it’s view).</p>
<p>March 18, 2014:</p>
<p>This is the castle.</p>
<p><img src="http://i57.tinypic.com/33z3arp.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>I like this texture a lot.</p>
<p><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/282q44m.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Guard bedroom. (all these shitty models were made by me with trusty google sketchup pro)</p>
<p><img src="http://i58.tinypic.com/23uc6r6.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>TODO LIST:</p>
<p>Pause Menu - need to add loading and saving games later, at the end.</p>
<p>Weapon Switching - needs animation.</p>
<p>Better AI - needs small bug fixes and a warning system. Also need to add sound sensitivity and light sensitivity.</p>
<p>Decorations - furniture, collectibles and such distributed around the map.</p>
<p>NPC models - need better ones possibly, obviously this guard is not that amazing. Needs attack animation and edit the walk and run animations because they aren’t perfect.</p>
<p>Level Design - I would like to make complex and well thought out thefts in large building and structures both above and below ground.</p>
<p>Multi-guard waypoint system - need to make compatibility with these waypoints. A different path for each guard, not gonna be hard to do at all.</p>
<p>Sound Effects - have added floor detection. On grass and gravel, footsteps sound like you are walking on grass or gravel and on wood or stone it sounds like you are walking on wood or stone. Need ambient sounds like in the forest and some light orchestral music to accompany the dark surroundings within the buildings.</p>
