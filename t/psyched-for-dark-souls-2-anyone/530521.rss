    <title>Psyched for Dark Souls 2 Anyone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/psyched-for-dark-souls-2-anyone/530521</link>
    <description>Hey all! As you may or may not know, the next game in the Souls series is coming out in March of 2014 I believe. This is the third game in the series and from what I&#39;ve seen on youtube, it looks AMAZING.

Do any of you guys play Demon&#39;s/Dark Souls? If so, leave a comment telling me of your favorite weapon in either game, your favorite of the two games, and what you are looking for in Dark Souls 2!</description>

              <p>Precisely, I have to admit, my first playthrough ended up in me not playing the game again for a few months. Then I decided to give it another shot, so I watched a guy on youtube “NorthernLion” do his playthrough as a Wanderer. From then on I began to get the gist of the game. It does require dedication but at my prime in the game, playing it gave me the feeling of nirvana</p>

              <p>I can explain it as absolute hell if you’re looking for a definition<br>
Just kidding, but I have absolutely no clue how people can play such a tough, rigid game (by rigid I mean it gives you absolutely no insight into any solutions to any problems whatsoever).<br>
I find it impressive that people actually have the dedication to do that shit</p>

              <p>It is such a fun game. The reason why most people hate it is because at the beginning, when you are VERY unfamiliar with the game, the game is very difficult, however, once you have beaten the game once or twice you will find everything very easy which is why they added NG+, or “you get to restart the game after beating it but the enemies are 2x harder”. This goes on indefinitely</p>
