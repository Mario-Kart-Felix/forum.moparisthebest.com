    <description>Hi, im having a few porblems (again) I got my server lookin sweet except a few things.

A &quot;null&quot; constantly logs in and out of my server and i dont know how to stop it.

Also in the varrock genral store, one of the p16 features is that the shop keeper kills the assistant, but...it may be hilarious but everytime it happens the server goes really mad.

If anyone has a solution to either, please help me, thx.</description>

              <p>null is also used when someone logs in without username, or if your on a server list, a server list connects to port 43594 as soon as your server comes up and will show up as null. so that might be it.</p>

              <p>yer the p16 feature has the npc thingy…erm…<br>
search the forums for npc vs. npc and theres a tut that tells you what to put in to make npcs fight just delete all the stuff the tut says you should put in to make npcs fight eachother<br>
and the null thing is good stops the server from crashing or lagging<br>
so they’re not problems just features you dont want<br>
[br][size=1]Posted at: October 27, 2006, 02:50:21 AM[/size][hr]if you want to stop that null thingy just get a new source or delete null.class and null.java but i reccomend you don’t its really helpful</p>
