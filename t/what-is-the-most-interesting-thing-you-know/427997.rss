Then explain how people don’t remember things from their childhood? Even if they are told what happened they still cannot remember, and if you can’t see how i was joking then you must be the idiot.</p>

<p>Some people have bad memory? Also, they’re most likely remembering it but not thinking about it. No, I can’t see how you were joking. Explain to me how making a joke about people not using 80% of their brain is funny. I am interested.</p>
<p>As to the last sentence: “I <span class="bbcode-i">did</span> shoot you in the gut, but you didn’t prevent the blood from spewing out so therefore you’re to blame for the fact that you bled out”.</p>
<p>Done arguing, it’s getting late.[/quote]<br>
Already explained how it was a joke, obviously you weren’t paying attention.</p>
<p>As for “I <span class="bbcode-i">did</span> shoot you in the gut, but you didn’t prevent the blood from spewing out so therefore you’re to blame for the fact that you bled out” it would have been their fault for not preventing them shooting the person, now if you want to take it any further pm me because this topic doesn’t need any more derailing.</p>

Why? Would it make you butthurt? Also that’s a pathetic comment, being brittish or aussie doesn’t make you any different from the rest of the world. I take it you’re the kind of person who agrees with slave labor?</p>
<p>When i said 99% that was a JOKE and then i said ‘like’ so i wasn’t being a stuck up know it all like yourself, good day sir.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Being British does make you different from the rest of the world, just as being Asian makes you different, being Italian makes you different, being French makes you different, need I say more?</p>
<p>Uhh I don’t agree with slave labor. I don’t know how the fuck you can draw that conclusion from me saying “I won’t lose an argument to a brit”. I typically wouldn’t want to lose an argument with anyone in particular (would you?). Possibly the reason I don’t want to lose an argument to you is because you can’t accept the fact that you said something extremely incorrect, to which I corrected you, to which you claimed you were just kidding about the whole thing.[/quote]<br>
Then why say you wouldn’t want to lose one to a ‘brit/aussie’, it just shows you find us lower then yourself by putting it the way you did. Africans were used for slave labor and because you obviously think certain races have less value then others. Stating you don’t want to lose an arguement just shows you’re too head strong to admit somethings you say aren’t right, and i actually did have correct information in there. 10% of the human brain is USED, storage does not count because most forget memories.</p>

<p>99% of that isn’t accessable by the regular human. Actually like 80% isn’t, some pople have been known ot use 10% or more but not everyone does.</p>
