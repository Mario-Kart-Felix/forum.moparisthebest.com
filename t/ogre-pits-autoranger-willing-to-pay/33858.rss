    <title>Ogre Pits AutoRanger Willing to pay!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ogre-pits-autoranger-willing-to-pay/33858</link>
    <description>I have looked thoroughout the site and have been unable to find an auto for the ogre pits (the King Lathas ones).

It would include:


Antiban
AntiRandom
Human like mouse movement!
Antilogout
NO SRL! I don&#39;t like it.
I wouldn&#39;t want it to be too long between the ogres because my range is 82+.  The standard autofighters I have used take too long in between ogres.

I would be willing to pat maybe 300k for this script.  Post how much you&#39;d be willing to script it for.  I do not think it would be impossible to script, but I don&#39;t know much about scripting, so post here.

If you have any ideas on what I should have added post here too, please.  Or, if you know of any scropts please post them too.

Thanks.</description>
