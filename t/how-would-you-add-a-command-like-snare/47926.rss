    <title>How would you add a command like ::snare</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-you-add-a-command-like-snare/47926</link>
    <description>how would you add a command like ::snare so it would snare the victem and they can&#39;t move indefinitely until you do ::unsnare or something like that... I don&#39;t need the code because thats easy its just like this.

[code]if(command.startsWith(&quot;snare&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3 &amp;&amp; command.length() &gt; 6) { // by jonyo
String name = command.substring(6);
client c = (client) PlayerHandler.players[PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(name)];
c.snaretimer += 100000;
updateRequired = true;
appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}[/code]

but what would if snaretimer &gt;= 1 have in it? any help would be appreciated I am using project 16 v. 6</description>
