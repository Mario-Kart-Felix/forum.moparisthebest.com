    <title>Talking to MySQL with a command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/talking-to-mysql-with-a-command/371989</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t really like asking for help, but I&#39;m somewhat stuck.

Basically, I&#39;m working on adding a vote reward system where if a player votes on a website, their information (username, ip etc) will be inserted into a table &quot;votes&quot; in a MySQL database. Then, when they enter a command in game to receive their reward, it will open a MySQL connection, check the table to see if they have voted, and if not give them said reward and set the &quot;received&quot; variable in the table to true, which will only change back to false upon a specified amount of time passing. I realize I could just make it so that on login it gives the reward, but I feel that that&#39;s unnecessary work for the server because not everyone who logs in will need to be checked for a vote reward, hence my creation of the command.



Here&#39;s the command they use in game to receive their reward
[code]if (playerCommand.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;getvote&quot;)) 
{
	c.sendMessage(&quot;1&quot;);
	MYSQL.createConnection();
	c.sendMessage(&quot;2&quot;);
	if(MYSQL.checkVotes(c.playerName))
	{
		c.sendMessage(&quot;3&quot;);
		if(MYSQL.voteGiven(c.playerName))
		{
			c.getItems().addItem(995,5000000);
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Thank you for voting!&quot;);
		}
	} 
	MYSQL.destroyCon();
}[/code]

The various sendMessage&#39;s are just there for me to try to isolate the problem. After I vote, I check the table in the MySQL database to see if the informations gone through (which it has, and the received variable is set to false, meaning the reward hasn&#39;t been claimed), and then use the command in game. When I do so only &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;2&quot; show up, meaning for some reason it&#39;s not passing the 
[code]MYSQL.checkVotes(c.playerName))[/code]

Here&#39;s that method
[code]public static boolean checkVotes(String playerName)
        {
                try {
                        Statement statement = con.createStatement();
                        String query = &quot;SELECT * FROM votes WHERE username = &#39;&quot; + playerName + &quot;&#39;&quot;;
                        ResultSet results = statement.executeQuery(query);
          
						while(results.next()) 
						{
                                int received = results.getInt(&quot;received&quot;);
                                if(received == 0)
                                {
                                    return true;
                                }
                       } 
                } catch(SQLException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                }
                return false;
        }[/code]

In PhpMyAdmin the table is displaying that &quot;received&quot; is in fact &quot;0&quot;, yet the checkVote() method is returning false..?
[code]if(received == 0)
         {
              return true;
         }[/code]

If it was returning true then it should enter the if statement here:
[code]if(MYSQL.voteGiven(c.playerName))
		{
			c.getItems().addItem(995,5000000);
			c.sendMessage(&quot;Thank you for voting!&quot;);
		}[/code]

Shouldn&#39;t it? 

So basically that&#39;s where I&#39;m at. I can&#39;t seem to locate the issue that&#39;s causing things to get caught up in the checkVote() method, or what is causing it to return false. My instinct says it&#39;s the former.</description>
