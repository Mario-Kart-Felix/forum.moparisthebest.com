    <title>Visual C# - One of the Slowest Languages?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/visual-c-one-of-the-slowest-languages/512681</link>
    <description>As some people here may or may not know, I&#39;ve been working on a game for over a month now, and I recently decided to improve some code to make it run a lot faster. However, the optimizations needed to be made due to C#&#39;s faults. I&#39;ve found a performance gain of at least 500%, going from a couple seconds for one chunk of generation to a small fraction of a second. Here&#39;s all I did:

-Changed the world block array from a multi-dimensional ([, ,]) array to a jagged array ([][][])
-Reduces method calls by copying the method&#39;s code and putting it where it&#39;s needed

These kinds of things shouldn&#39;t have to be changed to speed up a program. Does Java have these issues? I&#39;m almost considering learning C++ because of how much faster it is in this category of code, from what I read.

              <p>This just in, not understanding how the IL compiler works produces slower code. See: simple stack instructions [][] vs further method overheads [,]. Calling a method always has an overhead regardless of the language, especially if you’re using an interpreted language to write a software renderer? (are you not using gl/dx ?)</p>
<p>I’m not sure what .net runtime you’re targeting but there are caveats to jit inlining in c# which you might not be adhering to and are improved in 3.5, even more so in 4.5 and newer mono. Alternatively you may be subroutin’ing way too much useless stuff you don’t need to.</p>
<p>This is a good thing though, lots of game developer have to optimise. Keep that profiler handy and a learn to use an ildasm when you want to dig deeper.</p>

<p>In lectures most of the time they teach you C++ over a 3 week period which covers a lot of the basics. Along side general programming knowledge you can start writing applications and C++ does not heavily enforce conventions either. I would say it’ll take around 1 year to really get to know the language in death maybe not even that.</p>

I agree with you.</p>
<p>C# is in the category of “never use” for me, along with php. If the aforementioned “optimizations” are the way to speed up the application, then there is a serious flaws within the language (well, compiler). I would discard it immediately.[/quote]Well, the thing is they don’t make major differences unless used in hundreds upon thousands of iterations. These are the tiny things that I only managed to find thanks to a performance profiler. Here’s what the latest snapshot looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://puu.sh/2rBi3" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>The actual code being done is really light-weight, but I guess how many times I’m calling the code isn’t good. I read that calling a method requires a copy of each parameter to be made, so that could be one reason it slows down.</p>

              <p>Java HotSpot (that uses JIT etc.) performs method inlining and other optimizations, whenever possible. Microsofts equivalent runtime also contains a JIT compiler, that does the same. But there seems to be quite a few limitations to it. Methods greater than 32 bytes of IL won’t be inlined. Neither will virtual methods, methods with complex control flow (control flow with constructs such as switch and while) or methods that contains exception-handling.</p>
