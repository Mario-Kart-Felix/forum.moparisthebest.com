    <title>JAVAC Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/javac-question/273721</link>
    <description>I know this has been asked a million times or more, and i know i have asked this in the past.

I recently got a new computer, and wanted to get back to server coding, i know all my coding stuff, and i still have my old source, anyway..


My question is: When i see  &quot;&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command..&quot; what do i have to download? I forget!



Please and thank you..
I also ask that you respect me, and my question, the first bit of spam, flame, or anything of that nature will be reported to a mod.
BTW This is my new account because the email to my old account i have forgotten, and i forgot my password..</description>

I tried Googling it, but it came up with so many different downloads i didn’t know what one to choose.</p>
