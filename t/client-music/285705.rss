    <description> Alright, well too be honest. I&#39;ve been here since 2006 and I have not [b][i]once[/i][/b] seen a server with loaded music into certain cities. I&#39;m not talking about the original RuneScape music. People are perfectly able to find &#39;classical&#39; music to add.


For Example:

Here is my [b][i]theme song[/i][/b] for my server I&#39;m working on off of a scratch source.

So are people just lazy, don&#39;t want to add music because of size?

Just fill me in or discuss.

Because personally, that song above gives some people chills, it fits well with my server. 

So post opinions.


Please, just no immature kitty comments from the 12 year olds.</description>

              <p>What are you talking about with “Custom music” and loaded into certain cities? Are you talking about when you enter Falador, play a song made for Falador, and then same for Lumbridge, etc…?</p>
<p>And for custom music, as in? Some you made? If not, then how does that differ from whatever else people put in?</p>
<p>These are bad ideas because they would most likely not get used, and I’m sure many people would prefer to listen to their own music rather than music that an owner thought fit with something.</p>

</aside>
<p>Mine has it, the only problem is I don’t know if I want to pack it into the cache. I might want to have a music folder. Inside that folder will be folders with the city’s name on it. Inside of that will be the theme song for the area. So that way people could customize it.</p>
