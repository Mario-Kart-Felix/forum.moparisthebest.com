<p>Metallica is a Heavy Metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles California by the drummer Lars Ulrich.<br>
He posted an ad in the local newspaper and found 3 other band mates. The guitarist (and God), Kirk Hammet, Vocalist and Rythm Guitarist, James Hetfield and Bassist, Cliff Burton.(R.I.P)</p>
<p>In 1982 Metallica began recording their first original song “Hit The Lights” Metallica created enough buzz with this song to be rewarded their 1st gig at Radio City in Anaheim California. Metallica was ready to record their first studio album, but when Metal Blade was unable to cover the additional cost they had to look at other possible options.Concert promoter Johnny “Z” Zazula, who had heard the 1982 No Life 'til Leather demo, offered to broker a record deal with Metallica and New York City-based record labels. After receiving no interest from various record labels, Zazula borrowed the money to cover the record’s recording budget and signed Metallica to his own label, Megaforce records.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Kill 'em all and Ride The Lighning:</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>In 1983 Metallica travelled to Rochester to begin recording their first album “Metal up your ass.” But due to conflicts with the bands record label and the refusal to release the album under that name they changed it to “Kill em’ All.” The album peaked on the Billboard 200 at number 120. Although the album was not a huge financial sucess it earned the band enough fans in the underground metal scene.</p>
<p>Metallica recorded their second studio album “Ride the Lightning” at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen Denmark. Release in late 1984 the album peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200. A French printing press mistakenly printed green covers for the album, which are now considered collectors’ items. Other songs on the album include “For Whom the Bell Tolls”, “Fade to Black”, “Creeping Death” (which tells the biblical story of the Hebrews’ exodus from slavery in Egypt, focusing on the various plagues that were visited on the Egyptians.)</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Master Of Puppets (My Personal Favorite)</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>Michael Alago, a record dealer, attended a 1984 Metallica Concert. Impressed with what he saw he signed Metallica to Elektra Records. Metallica’s burgeoning success was such that the band’s British label Music for Nations issued a limited edition Creeping Death EP, which sold 40,000 copies as an import in the U.S. Two of the three songs on the record (cover versions of Diamond Head’s “Am I Evil?”, and Blitzkrieg’s “Blitzkrieg”) appeared on the 1989 Elektra reissue of Kill 'Em All. Metallica embarked on its first major European tour with Tank to an average crowd of 1,300. Returning to the U.S. marked a tour co-headlining with W.A.S.P. and Armored Saint supporting. Metallica played its largest show at the Monsters of Rock festival on August 17, 1985, with Bon Jovi and Ratt at Donington Park in England, playing in front of 70,000 people. A show in Oakland, California, at the Day on the Green festival saw the band play in front of a crowd of 60,000.</p>
<p>Metallica’s third studio album, Master of Puppets was recorded at Sweet Silence Studios and was released in March 1986. The album peaked at number 29 on the Billboard 200, and spent 72 weeks on the chart. The album was the band’s first to be certified gold on November 4, 1986, and was certified six times platinum in 2003. Following the release of the album, Metallica supported Ozzy Osbourne for a United States tour.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Burtons Death and Garage Days Revisited</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of Metallica’s Damage Inc. tour, members drew cards to see which bunk of the tour bus they would sleep in. Burton won and chose to sleep in Hammett’s bunk. Around dawn near Dörarp, Sweden, the bus driver lost control and skidded, which caused the bus to flip several times. Ulrich, Hammett, and Hetfield sustained no serious injuries; however, bassist Burton was pinned under the bus and was killed. Hetfield recalls, “I saw the bus lying right on him. I saw his legs sticking out. I freaked. The bus driver, I recall, was trying to yank the blanket out from under him to use for other people. I just went, ‘Don’t fucking do that!’ I already wanted to kill the guy.” Burton’s death left Metallica’s future in doubt. The three remaining members decided that Burton would want them to carry on, and with the Burton family’s blessings, the band sought a replacement.</p>
<p>Roughly 40 people tried out for auditions including Hammett’s childhood friend Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam. Newsted learned Metallica’s entire setlist, and after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy’s Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided that Newsted was the one to replace Burton, and Newsted’s first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members took it on themselves to “initiate” Newsted by tricking him into eating a ball of wasabi.</p>
<p>In March 1987, Hetfield broke his wrist a second time skateboarding. Guitar technician Marshall returned playing rhythm guitar, but the injury forced the band to cancel a Saturday Night Live appearance. Metallica finished its tour in the early months of 1987, and in August 1987 an all-covers EP titled The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited was released. The EP was recorded in an effort to utilize the band’s newly constructed recording studio, test out the talents of Newsted, and to relieve grief and stress following the death of Burton. A video titled Cliff 'Em All was released in 1987 commemorating Burton’s three years in Metallica. Footage included bass solos, home videos, and pictures.</p>
<p>&lt;3 R.I.P Cliff you were a God.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">…And Justice For All.</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>…And Justice for All, the group’s first studio album since Burton’s death, was released in 1988. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number six on the Billboard 200, the band’s first album to enter the top 10. The album went platinum only 9 weeks after being out. Newsted’s bass was purposely turned down on the album as a part of the continuous “hazing” he received, and his musical ideas were ignored (However, he did receive a writing credit on track one, “Blackened”). There were complaints with the production; namely, Steve Huey of Allmusic noted Ulrich’s drums were clicking more than thudding, and the guitars “buzz thinly”.</p>
<p>In 1989, Metallica received its first Grammy Award nomination for …And Justice for All, in the new Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrument category. Metallica was the favorite to win; however, the award was given to Jethro Tull for the album Crest of a Knave. The result generated controversy among fans and the press, as Metallica was standing off-stage waiting to receive the award after performing the song “One”. Jethro Tull had been advised by its manager not to attend the ceremony as he was expecting Metallica to win. The award was named in Entertainment Weekly’s “Grammy’s 10 Biggest Upsets”.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Self Titled Album</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>In October 1990, Metallica entered One on One studio in North Hollywood to record its next album. Bob Rock, who had worked with the bands The Cult, Bon Jovi, and Mötley Crüe, was hired as producer. Metallica (also known as “The Black Album”) was remixed three times, cost $1 million, and ended three marriages. Although the release was stalled until 1991, Metallica debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with shipments exceeding 650,000 units in its first week. The album was responsible for bringing Metallica to the attention of the mainstream and has been certified 15 times platinum in the United States, which makes it the 25th highest-selling album in the country. The making of Metallica and the following tour was documented in A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica. Dubbed the Wherever We May Roam Tour, it lasted 14 months and included dates in the United States, Japan, and England.</p>
<p>On August 8, 1992, during the co-headlining GNR-Metallica Stadium Tour with Guns N’ Roses, Hetfield suffered second and third degree burns to his arms, face, hands, and legs. There was confusion with the new pyrotechnics setup, which resulted with Hetfield walking into a 12-foot (3.7 m) flame during “Fade to Black”. Newsted recalls Hetfield’s skin was “bubbling like on The Toxic Avenger”. Guitar technician John Marshall, who had previously filled in on rhythm guitar and was now playing in Metal Church, replaced Hetfield for the remainder of the tour as Hetfield was unable to play guitar, although he was able to sing. The band’s first box set was released in November 1993 called Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge. The collection contained three live CDs, three home videos, and a book filled with riders and letters.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Load, ReLoad, Garage Inc., and S&amp;M</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>After almost three years of touring to support Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band took a break in the summer of 1995 and played three outdoor shows which included headlining Donington Park in the United Kingdom, supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash’s Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape From The Studio '95. The band spent roughly one year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996, which entered the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts at number one, marking the band’s second number one. The cover of Load was created by Andres Serrano, and was called Blood and Semen III. Serrano pressed a mixture of his own semen and bovine blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in musical direction for the band and a new look with band members receiving haircuts. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in the summer of 1996.</p>
<p>During early production of the album, the band had produced enough material for a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released, and the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in the follow-up album, ReLoad. The cover was created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. ReLoad peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, and number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield noted in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the songs on these albums were initially thought by the band to be of average quality, and were “polished and reworked” until judged to be releasable.</p>
<p>In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs titled Garage Inc… The first disc contained newly recorded covers by bands such as Diamond Head, Killing Joke, The Misfits, Thin Lizzy, Mercyful Fate, and Black Sabbath. The second disc featured the original The $5.98 E.P.: Garage Days Re-Revisited, which had become a scarce collectors’ item. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two.</p>
<p>On April 21 and April 22, 1999, Metallica recorded two performances with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra conducted by Michael Kamen. Kamen, who had previously worked with producer Rock on “Nothing Else Matters”, approached the band in 1991 with the idea of pairing Metallica’s music with a symphony orchestra. Kamen and his staff of over 100 composed additional orchestral material for Metallica songs. Metallica wrote two new Kamen-scored songs for the event, “No Leaf Clover” ( The worlds greatest song) and “-Human”. The audio recording and concert footage were released in 1999 as the album and concert film S&amp;M. It entered the Billboard 200 at number two, and the Australian ARIA charts and Top Internet Albums chart at number one.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">The Napster Controversy</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>In 2000, Metallica discovered that a demo of its song “I Disappear”, which was supposed to be released in combination with the Mission: Impossible II soundtrack, was receiving radio airplay. Tracing the source of the leak, the band found the file on the Napster peer-to-peer file-sharing network, and also found that the band’s entire catalogue was freely available. Legal action was initiated against Napster with Metallica filing a lawsuit at the U.S. District Court, Central District of California, alleging that Napster violated three areas of the law: copyright infringement, unlawful use of digital audio interface device, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</p>
<p>Though the lawsuit named three universities for copyright infringement, the University of Southern California, Yale University, and Indiana University, no individuals were named. Yale and Indiana complied and blocked the service from its campuses, and Metallica withdrew the universities’ inclusion in the lawsuit. Southern California, however, had a meeting with students to figure out what was going to happen with Napster. School administrators wanted it banned as it used 40% of the bandwidth, which was not for educational purposes.</p>
<p>Metallica hired online consulting firm NetPD to monitor the Napster service for a weekend. A list of 335,435 Napster users who were believed to be sharing Metallica’s music was compiled, and the 60,000 page document was delivered to Napster’s office as Metallica requested the users be banned from the service. The users were banned, and rap artist Dr. Dre joined the lawsuit against Napster, which resulted in an additional 230,142 Napster users banned.</p>
<p>Ulrich provided a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding copyright infringement on July 11, 2000. Federal Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered the site place a filter on the program in 72 hours or be shut down. A settlement was reached between Metallica and Napster when German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG BMG showed interest to purchase the rights to Napster for $94 million. Under the terms of settlement, Napster agreed to block users who shared music by artists who do not want their music shared. However, on June 3, 2002 Napster filed for Chapter 11 protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws. On September 3, 2002, an American bankruptcy judge blocked the sale to Bertelsmann and forced Napster to liquidate its assets according to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy laws.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Newsteds Departure And St. Anger</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>As plans were being made to enter the recording studio, Newsted left the band on January 17, 2001. His statement revealed his departure was based on “private and personal reasons, and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love.”</p>
<p>Metallica held auditions for Newsted’s permanent replacement in early 2003, after St Anger 's completion, for which Bob Rock recorded bass. Bassists that auditioned included Pepper Keenan, Jeordie White, Scott Reeder, Eric Avery, Danny Lohner, and Chris Wyse. Following three months of auditions, Robert Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy Osbourne’s band, was chosen as the new bassist.</p>
<p>In June 2003, Metallica’s eighth studio album, St. Anger, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and drew mixed reaction from critics. Ulrich’s “steely” sounding snare drum, and the absence of guitar solos received particular criticism. Kevin Forest Moreau of <a href="http://shakingthrough.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">Shakingthrough.net</a> commented that “the guitars stumble in a monotone of mid-level, processed rattle; the drums don’t propel as much as struggle to disguise an all-too-turgid pace; and the rage is both unfocused and leavened with too much narcissistic navel-gazing”, and Brent DiCrescenzo of Pitchfork Media described it as “an utter mess”.  However, Blender magazine called it the “grimiest and grimmest of the band’s Bob Rock productions”, and New York Magazine called it “utterly raw and rocking”. The title track, “St. Anger”, won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2004, and was used as the official theme song for WWE’s SummerSlam 2003.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Death Magnetic</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>Death Magnetic debuted at number one in several countries to make it top the Australian, Canadian, Mexican and European album chart. Selling 490,000 units in the United States to debut at number one, Metallica became the first band to have five consecutive studio albums debut at number one in the history of the Billboard 200. After a week of its release, Death Magnetic remained at number one on the Billboard 200, the European album chart, and became the fastest selling album in Australia for 2008.</p>
<p>Death Magnetic stayed at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart for three consecutive weeks. Metallica became the only artist, aside from Jack Johnson with the release of the album Sleep Through the Static, to remain on the Billboard 200 for three consecutive weeks at number one in 2008. Death Magnetic had also remained at number one on Billboard’s Hard Rock, Modern Rock/Alternative and Rock album charts for five consecutive weeks. Internationally, the album peaked at number one in 32 countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.</p>
<p>In November 2008, Metallica came to the end of their record deal with Warner Bros., and the band is now considering their options for the future and, according to Ulrich, one of their options is to release their next album through the internet. Recently, James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett were added to “Chop Shop’s” list of “Top 100 Most Complete Guitar Players of All Time” at number fourteen and twenty-six, respectively.</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Hall of Fame</span></span>[/size]</p>
<p>On January 14, 2009, it was announced that Metallica would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 4, 2009, and that former bassist Jason Newsted (who left the band in 2001), would perform with the band at the ceremony. Initially, it was announced that the matter had been discussed, and that current bassist Robert Trujillo had agreed not to play, as he “wanted to see the Black Album band”. However, during the band’s set of “Master of Puppets” and “Enter Sandman”, both Trujillo and Newsted were on stage.[78] Ray Burton, the father of late bassist Cliff Burton accepted the honour on his behalf. Metallica also invited Dave Mustaine to take part in the induction ceremony, but he declined, citing his touring commitments in Europe.</p>
