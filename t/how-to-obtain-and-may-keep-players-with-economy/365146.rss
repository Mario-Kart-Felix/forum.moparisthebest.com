Economy 

[i][b]Right Now , MOST servers are doing the ::pickup or ::item on all the time and just a Player Vs Player Combat Mostly , Also When Doing That Its DONATION Based. Some owners care about the server , and Fix the Bugs and glitchies. [/b][/i]

Main Point : [b]PLAYERS GET MAD WHEN &quot;ROFL PWNED NUB CAK3!&quot; Appears to them.[/b]

[b]1.[/b] [u]Economy[/u]

Players , your main goal to keep them happy.
The Word Economy is a key word , Meaning labor , Land resorces and capital.
Dont do many to drop party&#39;s ( One On A Holiday for a release is Fine.) is one way to keep your economy in good shape. Also Donations are fine just dont push people to donate,
like recently i heard about voting for items on another site is aloud, We evan have a tutorial on it in  this section. Donation Shop is what people enjoy ( Donaters ) , What i suggest is putting a block on the item to make only donaters be able to wear it. One thing you do not do is make over powerd wepons. The Use of tickets or tokens to evolve a pile of max coins into 1 ticket is worth it , but make it able to turn back into coins. Customs are not bad , but they can be. my explanion is your able to relase a few customs like now vesta and statuis are NOT Customs now , Because Alot of Sources have them added.

This is basicly my way to keeping players on a server economicly.
