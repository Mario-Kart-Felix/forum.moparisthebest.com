    <title>Writing To A URL</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/writing-to-a-url/169347</link>
    <description>I&#39;m about to make a website, the website is mainly for players, to check things, logs, etc.

I know how to read from a URL with a password and username, but i need to know how to write, if possible. Because i&#39;ve looked and i can&#39;t find.

For example, when a person is banned, it will write to my bannedusers.txt as well as the websites bannedusers.txt .

Hopefully someone can help me, thanks in advance.

I got it write to my CMD, i put some random text into the file.

EDIT:

FileOutputStream

Or there such thing as:

InputStreamWriter</description>

<p>You can’t program java into a website, it’s not java, it’s javascript for websites.</p>
<p>I’m only using java to write to a file that is on a website.</p>
