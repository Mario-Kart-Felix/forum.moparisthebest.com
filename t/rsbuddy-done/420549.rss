    <description>http://rsbuddy.com/forum/recent-developments-moving-bots-174891.html

Was already posted on moparscape but I figured I&#39;d post here too; Jacmob has come out and said that RSBuddy will not be returning, nor will other major bots

&lt;blockquote&gt;Recent Developments - Moving On From Bots
[b]Why have you put an end to RSBuddy’s bot client?
[/b]
Bots have changed the gameplay of RuneScape. With the use of bots becoming increasingly widespread since the introduction of free trade, and the recent announcements by Jagex, it is clear that bots have become flagrantly detrimental to the game. If you’re like any of us and you enjoy playing RuneScape, you’ll have noticed that bots are anti-social and make the time you spend playing feel diminished in worth. At the same time, bots are abused heavily by gold farmers to ruin the game to a significant extent only for their profit. We hope to assist in the selfless movement by Jagex in fixing this problem and hope that you will join us in playing the game with real people.

[b]Is this the end of all botting in RuneScape?
[/b]
Yes. I am confident that you will not see the return of major bot clients to RuneScape, and that the small number of simple &#39;auto-clickers&#39; and &#39;screen-scrapers&#39; that remain will be dealt with very soon.

[b]Another bot site says they’ll be up soon; why shouldn’t we believe them?
[/b]
The other bot sites out there may claim for a bit longer that they will fix their bots within the next few days or weeks: Had I decided to release RSBuddy 1.5 to the public, it would have required another overhaul just a few days later. The fact that no other botting sites had any update ready by the end of last week shows how exceedingly far behind they are. Don’t hold your breath.

[b]I know another huge MMO that hasn’t dealt with bots; what makes RuneScape different?
[/b]
Removing bots from the game requires both commercial investment and the time of talented developers with other updates to work on. I haven’t seen any other company willing to take that hit; it requires a huge amount of care for the game we’re here for.

[b]I used RSBuddy on my account, am I going to be banned?
[/b]
The information we have on customers and users is private and won’t be used to ban any accounts. We hope that you have come to understand why botting has no place in the game and take this opportunity to become part of the RuneScape community.

[b]I purchased a premium script, am I entitled to a refund?
[/b]
If you purchased a script within 7 days of the update last Tuesday we will happily refund your purchase on request. Any purchases made before this time are not eligible for refunds. Information on subscription changes is available on our subscriptions page.

[b]This is the end for bots, not for you!
[/b]
It’s not only you that doesn’t have a bot client to use. RuneScape is a social game for humans to play. If you feel that there was anything botting did to keep you interested in the game, please join the discussion of what updates would remove any need for them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<p>Then if it was because they distributed part of the client with ‘their cheats’, that wouldn’t technically be copy right but rather against their T.O.S. , right? Which is why they forced paypal into giving customers information out?</p>

Since he could not get a stable version of the bot, or a working version, this is what he did instead. Mod MMG revoked the offer mid last week to hire anyone who created a bot that worked after the update, and they have not made any comments what so ever on hiring him(that I have seen). They probably had their lawyers hand him some paper work, told him to sign or be sued much like they did to Speljohan with Zetabot or w\e the name of the bot was.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you read your IRC logs, you’ll see Jacmob mentioning that a few people witnessed RSBuddy 1.5. The bot would become difficult to maintain over the long run. That just reinforces Moparisthebest’s point – cheating on RuneScape (or any other game in general) is always possible.[/quote]So who are we to believe? All I know is he was doing lots of things to increase his page views, and lying about/faking all his release dates didn’t seem to perturb him at all.</p>
<p>‘Jacmob said’ – that’s the key phrase there. Again, you suggest we automatically assume what Jacmob says is the truth. I personally don’t believe he did get it to work (in a botting fashion, whether or not he got it to ‘load’ the client is not important). As to whether he was hired by JaGex, I don’t have a clue, but it’s not important. Nobody is saying cheating on RuneScape isn’t possible, almost everyone here knows about Simba and SRL.</p>

              <p>It certainly isn’t impossible to cheat on the game now or anything like that.  Everyone said the EXACT same thing when Jagex killed Aryan with the 400 update, things like there will never be any big java cheats again, etc etc.  If there is one thing I have learned over the years, it is that RS cheating never dies, it just takes breaks.</p>

<p>He’s pretty wealthy (pre-RSBuddy) and he makes quite a lot of money from the project, why wouldn’t he just go an hire a professional Java engineering team to aid him if he personally couldn’t fix it. It sure smells like he sold his soul to Jagex.</p>

<p>Hah, why are you under the impression a “professional Java engineering team” would be able to get past this? Most professional Java programmers probably know less than the majority of the elitists at this community. It doesn’t take a lot of skill/knowledge to be a “professional” Java developer. Just saying…[/quote]<br>
perhaps, but i’m sure a team could produce something more effectively than one person. (silabsoft offered this idea on irc)</p>
