<p>Yup, I can vouch for this and add that the ballistic knife pretty much brings Commando back without having to equip it as a perk.</p>
<p>RC-XD isn’t nearly as bad though since it was nerfed. If you have Flak Jacket and an RC-XD runs into your legs and blows up, it barely takes 50% of your health, if that.</p>

When I did decide to play, scavenger all the way <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">  Nothing more fun than spraying the fuck out of someone and completely refilling your ammo from their dead corpse.</p>

<p>The campaign for Undead Nightmare was a bit repetitive but it was fun. It could have been longer though. The game can easily get boring when you play it by yourself. When I play I have anywhere from 2-4 friends+ join me in a posse.</p>

<p>Yeah, there’s a decent number of people on almost any game-type and Undead Nightmare rejuvenated some of the old players. It’s good fun when you get a lot of friends with RDR, get into a posse, and just do free roam or something. Undead Overrun is much more fun/difficult than CoD Zombies, imo. (In most situations).[/quote]<br>

              <p>Think I’m done with the whole call of duty series, and I’ve played since cod2. Tbh everything they’ve put out lately has been essentially the same game over and over again. Same engine, style of gameplay and controls (I’ll give them credit though, the controls work very well). Just funny to laugh at the people who have spent $180 over cod’s after cod4 and complained about every single one and never play them anymore.</p>

Made it to level 50.  Stopped playing for about a month, prestiged and got to level 20 or something, and now its in my closet.  I usually play RDR, MW2 (only because a lot of my friends still play it), MLB 2k11/Madden 11.<br>

<p>I would have never made it that far if it wasn’t for friends playing with me. Now all of those same friends have moved to RDR. :)[/quote]<br>
