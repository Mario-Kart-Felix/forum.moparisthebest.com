    <description>Is anyone pretty good with portforwarding? I went to 192.168.0.1 and made internal and external ports 43594 open on 192.168.0.12 on TCP and UDP and clicked enable. Then I went to my Firewall and unchecked &quot;Block fragmented IP Packets&quot; and &quot;Block Port Scan Detection&quot;. Then I went into my windows Firewall and made two inbound rules to allow on port 43594. My router is a Cisco Dps3825. Can anyone PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help me? All port checkers still say closed.</description>
