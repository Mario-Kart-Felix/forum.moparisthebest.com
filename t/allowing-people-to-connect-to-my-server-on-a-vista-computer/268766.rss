              <p>The only thing you did wrong was PORTFORWARDING, and to fix the “ipconfig”, Right click the command prompt, and click “Run As Administrator”. When you did that, type in “ipconfig”. Where it says IPV4 Adress, that is the thing you put in your PORTFORWARING THING.<br>
For example:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg51/begonein2min/untitled-14.png" title="untitled-14.png" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i245.photobucket.com/albums/gg51/begonein2min/untitled-14.png" alt width="690" height="266"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">untitled-14.png</span><span class="informations">924×357</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
