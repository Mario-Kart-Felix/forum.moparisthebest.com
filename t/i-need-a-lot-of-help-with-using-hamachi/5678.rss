    <title>I need a LOT of help with using Hamachi</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-a-lot-of-help-with-using-hamachi/5678</link>
    <description>Okay, I would just like to say first off, please don&#39;t spam or flame.

I know how to join a network in Hamachi, then put the server&#39;s IP into MoparScape, but it never works for me. I have run out of ideas, and if possible, I would like some help with the problem. Thanks.</description>
