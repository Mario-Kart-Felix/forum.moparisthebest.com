    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-dont-understand-this/469232</link>
    <description>so ive been hosting my server for a few months now and everything has been fine for most of it. a few dupers here and there and i find how they were duping and fix it...but now i feel like ive fixed all the dupes yet there has been a crazy amount of dupers in the past 2-3 days...i can&#39;t find the dupe they are using  and im going crazy. any suggestions?

trisidiax V2 source

also players are coming onto my server and doing what we are calling &quot;Morphing&quot; on my server which is when lets say their character name is &quot;pker123&quot; and theres another player named &quot;ipktoday&quot; then the morpher pker123 can log in and his name will show as the second guy ipktoday...so everyone thinks its the second guy when really its the first...

any suggestions on how to fix both of these guys? :(</description>
