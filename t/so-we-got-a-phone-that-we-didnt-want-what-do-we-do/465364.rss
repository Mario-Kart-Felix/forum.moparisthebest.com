    <title>So we got a phone that we didn&#39;t want, what do we do?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/so-we-got-a-phone-that-we-didnt-want-what-do-we-do/465364</link>
    <description>Ok, so my dad was buying an iPhone 4 because it was only $1. However, it had to be shipped, so he asked for it to be cancelled and got an iPhone 4S instead. Now, the $1 was never refunded on his credit card, and guess what showed up a few days ago. So yeah, we have 2 iPhones now, and neither of us are sure what to do with the 4. Can we use it or not? The money paid for it was never refunded, but we still got the phone and it technically has no contract (which, in reality will make the phone cost $450 :| ). Should we return it or just wait to see what happens?</description>
