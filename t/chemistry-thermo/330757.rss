    <description>i have few questions:

1. for a reversible reaction is entropy zero, i though Q=0 for entropy to be equal to zero or go in a cycle.
2. how is heat of reversible process is greater than of irreversible process.


i did this question, but having hard time calculation Gibbs free energy.

1 mole of nitrogen gas goes through the following process:

irreversible expansion, from initial temperature of 25 Celsius and initial pressure 2atm to final temperature -5 Celsius and final pressure 1atm.

Cp of nitrogen = 29.1 joule/(k.Mol) and S (298.15) = 191.5j/(k.mol) at 25 Celsius.

i calculated the enthalpy = -873 joule. entropy (S) =2.67 joule/kelvin

and i need to calculate the Gibbs free energy, i need to use this equation, Gibbs free energy = enthalpy - (T2S2-T1S1).

answer is G= 3980J, anyone help please/</description>
