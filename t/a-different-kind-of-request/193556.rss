    <title>A different kind of request</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-different-kind-of-request/193556</link>
    <description>Well... here&#39;s the thing. I&#39;m great at making websites. I suck at photoshop and i suck even more at imagining things. 

[size=20pt]T[/size]his is generally what i need... My mind has been set for a while to make a web development forum (smf). But of course it would need its own design. What you would have to do is make a light-colored forum theme that is stunning. I&#39;m sure we could work out some kind of reward, although it cannot be money or anything like that.

If you are interested in helping, my msn is [font=arial]Mike.Wayne.Vartan@gmail.com[/font]</description>
