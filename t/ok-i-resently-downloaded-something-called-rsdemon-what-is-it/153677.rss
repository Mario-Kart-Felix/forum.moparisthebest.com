              <p>Well there was a runescape bot a while ago which you had to pay for keys (Like one key per bot)</p>
<p>It ran without opening the RS client so effectively you were able to run many bots at one time, I’m not sure what happened to it or whether it works at all anymore. (It was like $2 per key)<br>
The bot cut trees until level 15, then cut oaks until 30, then cut willows until 60, it then cut yew trees forever.<br>
It was possible to make more then 2$ worth of gold a week so it was quite a good way to make money (excluding if you got banned)</p>
<p>Anyways there is also a runescape help client called RSDEMON which was commonly mistaken for the actual bot. It was alot like switch swift (had an item look up database to see the price of individual items and such)</p>
<p>So in my opinion you are probably downloading the client.</p>
