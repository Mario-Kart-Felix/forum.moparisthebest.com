    <title>Desktop Switcher! Must Read!~</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/desktop-switcher-must-read/159099</link>
    <description>On AIM, my friend tried to get me to use this program that allows you to get on the other persons desktop and see everything they are doing and get into their files and stuff, but also be on your desktop at the same time. Their desktop will be a tab at the bottom to see everything they are doing, but they have to have this program and they can see what your doing to. But the good thing is that, you can lock their keyboard and mouse up so they can&#39;t do anything. It will display a toolbar at the top of their desktop that will give you options such as locking or switching back or ending the program. Since you both have to have it downloaded, when you are done downloading, an icon will appear on your desktop called &quot;TeamVeiwer&quot;. Click on that and an icon should pop up saying the Id and Pass the other person types in to connect to your desktop as well as you to them. Then go on from their. The download link is 
http://www.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewerQS.exe
Cop and paste that into your internet browser and if you have downloaded something before, do everything the same. Any questions or comments, please post. I hope you like this because it is fun. I am not responsable for you getting hacked. This is just a good way to be nosy or interact with your friends better. Ok hope you like! =)</description>

That is the part I messed up on. To get be able to start it up you have to download something else. When I get the link I will re-edit my post. Thanks!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tightvnc.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.tightvnc.com</a> or google it cause i’m not sure if thats the direct link.</p>
<p>To use it just start up the server and edit the password so that its not easy to guess and so scanners don’t pick it up.</p>
<p>And if your behind a router forward the ports like so.</p>
<p>Name: VNC Server<br>
Protocol: Both<br>
Starting Port: 5800<br>
Ending Port: 5900<br>
Ip:192.168.#.# (start&gt;run&gt;cmd type in ipconfig and its the one thats beside ip adress)</p>
<p>Now for you friend to connect they need any of the vnc viewers ors they can put your ip in there webbrowser and connect from there.</p>
