    <description>Hello everyone, and welcome to my thread.

[b]what is in this thread?[/b]
In this thread you wil basicly find things I would like to (be) add(ed) to my server.
I am new to coding so i&#39;m asking you guys to help me with project SickScape2.0 and we could make it the best 317 around! 


[b]How do you want us to receive the Source and client files?[/b]
Very Simple, just mail me to: [email]theg0dpkerzs@gmail.com[/email] and I will send you the files!

what I see in most devolepment team threads are requirements, the only thng you need is having fun in coding and making a server!

[b]What does the server have till now?[b]
Well, first i&#39;m willing to make my serer Blank and add the following things:

-Walking npc&#39;s
-air guitar
-more commands
-A bigger Mod zone with shops and custom items.
-Real veng and skillcape emotes.
