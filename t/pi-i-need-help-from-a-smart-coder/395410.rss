    <title>[PI] I need help from a smart coder!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-i-need-help-from-a-smart-coder/395410</link>
    <description>Okay, so i have a few bugs and stuff which i am trying to do to my server, but these are the ones i simply cannot fix myself, as i am a very new coder and im still learning.

1. Items which are supposed to be 100% Drop Rate, NEVER drop.

2. Need helping making a Close Bank Button.

3. There are certain items which are Invisible in your invent,bank and equiped items for some players, some can see it. when a player who can see it, equips them. they turn invisble for players who cant see those items.

4. Need help Implementing a FUNPk Area.

These are the mains things i need help with solving as i really cant do them for the life of me, i would appreciate if you just add my skype if you know how to fix any of these and we can get down to it asap, please dont post trolling comments on this about how retarded i am or somthing.

<li>
<p>Sounds like a Pi for drops use npcconstants<br>
npcid itemid that it drops 100%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To add bank button find the its line type in Close Bank then go to clickingbuttons.java<br>
and use the closebankid add some type of code</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>example may not be correct :<br>
case closebankid:<br>
c.getPA().closeBank();</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Its a Modeling fail, you can try to log out then in and maybe it will reload the model correctly but thats more of a model problem then server.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.umm make a public boolean<br>
public boolean funpk;</p>
