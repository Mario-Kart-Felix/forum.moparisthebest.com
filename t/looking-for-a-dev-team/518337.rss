    <title>Looking for a Dev Team</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-dev-team/518337</link>
    <description>Ok. I decided to start a new server over.
I am looking for some devs member to work along with me and 1 other.

If you want to join you can post any information on why I should let you help me.
I am looking for serious coders if you can&#39;t code than please don&#39;t apply.
If you get on the team you will be paid. This payment is decided on how well you contribute to the development of the server.

Use this format when applying.

First Name:
Username (s):
Age:
Java knowledge 1/10 :
Why I should pick you?

This project does not have a name yet, but soon as I get a bigger team I will then decided what it should be consider.

-Thanks

<p>You make it sound like you’re some god and any developer would be privileged to work for you. I suggest you change your tone. You’re the one looking for help because YOU NEED something, not the other way around. That’s coming from a developer and a server owner.</p>
