it is a 562 server.
looking for coders for the server and client
the server is on a vps that is 24/7 had a few problems in the past with getting things handled but only down time on the vps is when im doing a system reboot.

the vps has 24/7 teamviewer access only time someone wont be able to access it is when someone else is online. (unless more than one can connect at a time on teamviewer never tried so unsure of this.
