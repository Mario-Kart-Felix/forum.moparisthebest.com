    <description>Some of you may have seen my development thread: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,545647.0.html

If you have (if not give it a quick read) you&#39;d know that the cache is missing most of the members content. This will work perfectly fine considering this is a private server and things are easy to contain when the contents limited to a semi-large area such as lumbridge, varrock, falador &amp; draynor/port sarim (with sections of karamja). Unsure about Entrana just yet this could be a future patch once I&#39;ve worked on all content issues found during the public developers alpha.

Right now my key focus is in Varrock considering this could be a very viable place to introduce Herblore. The Apothicary from the quest Romeo &amp; Juliet looks like a prime location to host a store in which they sell supplies for trainers of Herblore, but just because one members skill can be introduced doesn&#39;t mean I can fit the rest in unfortunately. But there&#39;s only four including Herblore: with Agility, Fletching &amp; Thieving. (Any members content on a partial non-members skill will be fully introduced at some stage). If you have any input including shops or anything I&#39;ll be reading this frequently.

Thieving can be placed anywhere with NPCs, chests and stalls, Fletching is something that can also be added due to it&#39;s inventory simplicity. Agility is my biggest concern, depending if the objects are contained in the cache or not I might recreate an agility course in dranor if not it can be introduced another way (everyone having to go to one place to do the same thing to 99 is a bit bull shit anyway). I need others opinions in help of skill placement not because I can&#39;t do it on my own but because it&#39;s going to be a free community game and their input is more important than what I believe is balanced and fair training. Nothings worse than getting 99 in a skill within an hour, there isn&#39;t any value to the grind and it instantly because pointless and boring if everyone can get these stats &amp; items harvested.</description>
