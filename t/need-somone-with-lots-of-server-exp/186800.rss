    <description>I know I sound like a major noob, but I have tried every single tut, nub post etc. on how to make my compiler and run server work. I CAN NEVER GET THEM BOTH TO WORK AT THE SAME TIME!

<p>when i get a java/c is not recognzed from runserver and theres no path to edit in the file, is that cuz it doesnt see java at the default pos? and how do i edit the runserver path when theres only Java -X180L* or w/e?[br][br][size=1]Posted on: March 06, 2008, 11:45:02 AM[/size][hr]ok this is what happens…</p>
<p>RichScape v2…</p>
<p>compiler - WORKS!<br>
runserver - java is not recognized as internal or external command or runnable batch… blah blah blah</p>
<p>why? they have same path (i think)</p>
