              <p>ok.<br>
change what ever you want in clint.java<br>
compile</p>
<p>if your compilers not working replace it with this<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>
title SERVER NAME HERE Compiler<br>
“C:\Program Files\java\jdk1.5.0_09\bin\javac.exe” -cp . *.java<br>
“C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.5.0_09\bin\java.exe” server<br>
pause</p>
<p>you can replace the “09” with your java. then try and see if the updates happen i guess <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
