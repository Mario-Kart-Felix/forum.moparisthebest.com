    <title>Enslaved Dwarves and Tablets?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/enslaved-dwarves-and-tablets/547351</link>
    <description>So since RSC&#39;s method of turning non-stackable items stackable is boring, repetitive and limiting, why not implement something better? No, not RS2-esque &quot;notes&quot; but something unique to this game.

Instead of having the ability to instantly turn anything into a stackable item at a bank, why not have a middleman item? An item you have to exchange in order to get the stackable version of the item you want. 

My idea was to take the idea of rune essence, but apply it to bank notes. Have a stackable, &quot;blank slate/stone tablet&quot; item that players can mine, in a similar area to rune essence rocks. Players could then take these blank slates to a bank and have them scribe their non-stackable items onto them. Or, alternatively, because these items are tradeable, sell them to other players. This helps keep a constant money-making method for low-level players to get started while still contributing to the game.

More specifically, you could make it so the higher your mining level is, the more blank slates you can receieve in one click. This could help make the process less boring, and make mining more profitable.

If you wanted you could even introduce a small backstory and have basements of &quot;chiseling dwarves&quot; under each bank, responsible f or chiseling the pictures of items onto the tablets.</description>

I thought you were going to suggest a system where you could obtain and enslave dwarves to cert things for you. Hell, give the little guys commands like fish here -&gt; move here -&gt; cert here -&gt; Move here -&gt; Repeat until your little dwarf hands are nubs &gt;=)<br>

<p>I’d buy that for a dollar!</p>
