    <description>Hey, I was adding throwing knives to my source, and I am stumped with this last error.
Here is the error.

[code]client.java:7634: illegal start of expression
public boolean DeleteRing() {
^
1 error
Press any key to continue . . .[/code]

Yes, it does look simple, but I&#39;ve tried adding brackets before it, but it didn&#39;t work.

Here is the code.

[code]		}
		updateRequired = true;
		appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
		return true;
	}
	public boolean DeleteKnife() {
		if (playerEquipmentN[playerWeapon] == 0) {
			deleteequiment(playerEquipment[playerWeapon], playerWeapon);
			return false;
	}
        public boolean DeleteRing() {
		if (playerEquipmentN[playerWeapon] == 0) {
			deleteequiment(playerEquipment[playerWeapon], playerWeapon);
			return false;
	}

		if ((playerEquipmentN[playerWeapon] &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - 

lastAction &gt; actionInterval) {
			outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(34);
			outStream.writeWord(1688);
			outStream.writeByte(playerWeapon);
			outStream.writeWord(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] + 1);
			if (playerEquipmentN[playerWeapon] - 1 &gt; 254) {
				outStream.writeByte(255);
				outStream.writeDWord(playerEquipmentN[playerWeapon] - 1);
			} else {
				outStream.writeByte(playerEquipmentN[playerWeapon] - 1); // 

amount
			}
			outStream.endFrameVarSizeWord();
			playerEquipmentN[playerWeapon] -= 1;
		}[/code]

Any help would be appreciated! I hope I&#39;m not just not noticing some silly mistake.
Thanks in advance!</description>
