</aside>
<p>If you listened to his music, read up on him, yes some of his songs were like a typical rapper the battle raps.<br>
other songs they wasnt like any other rapper of his time, now other rappers try to mimic him.</p>
<p>Mopar, What type and who do you like in the music industry?</p>
<p>Its the fact tupac knew alot about politics and could change the black community around the world, is why alot of people cared so much about him.<br>
The media only showed his bad side, the one that got him thrown in prison for being charged for touching some other womans arse.</p>
<p>Read these lyrics, they aint of a typical rappers…</p>
<p>[code](What y’all want?)<br>
Unconditional Love (no doubt)<br>
Talking bout the stuff that don’t wear off<br>
It don’t fade<br>
It’ll last for all these crazy days<br>
These crazy nights<br>
Whether you wrong or you right<br>
I’m a still love you<br>
Still feel you<br>
Still there for you<br>
No matter what (hehe)<br>
You will always be in my heart<br>
With unconditional love</p>
<p>[Verse One:]</p>
<p>Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings<br>
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing<br>
How many caskets can we witness<br>
Before we see it’s hard to live<br>
This life without God, so we must ask forgiveness<br>
Ask mama why God deserved to die<br>
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes<br>
Before she could reply<br>
Though we were born without a silver spoon<br>
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)<br>
One day I hope to make it<br>
A player in this game<br>
Mama don’t cry, long as we try<br>
Maybe things change<br>
Perhaps it’s just a fantasy<br>
A life where we don’t need no welfare<br>
Shit with our whole family<br>
Maybe it’s me that caused it<br>
The fighting and the hurting<br>
In my room crying cause I didn’t want to be a burden<br>
Watch mama open up her arms to hugging<br>
And I ain’t worried bout a damn thang, with unconditionl love</p>
<p>[Chorus: 2x]</p>
<p>In this game the lesson’s in your eyes to see<br>
Though things change, the future’s still inside of me<br>
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark<br>
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love</p>
<p>[Verse Two:]</p>
<p>Just got the message you’ve been calling all week<br>
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain’t had a chance to speak<br>
But you know, with you and me it’s on G<br>
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me<br>
Where would I be without my dogs<br>
No one to ride with when times get hard<br>
Cause it ain’t easy being who we are<br>
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions<br>
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission<br>
Is to be more than just a rap musician<br>
The elevation of today’s generation<br>
If could make 'em listen<br>
Prison ain’t what we need, no longer stuck in greed<br>
Time to play and strategize, my family’s gotta eat<br>
When we make somethin out of nothing<br>
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good<br>
If they could cut out all the busting<br>
The liquor and the weed the cussing<br>
Sending love out to my block<br>
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>[Verse Three:]</p>
<p>I’ll probably never understand ya ways<br>
With everyday I swear I hear ya<br>
Trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time<br>
Just had a baby with the same eyes<br>
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times<br>
How come I never made it<br>
Maybe it’s the way the played it in my heart<br>
I knew one day I gotta be a star<br>
My hopes and all my wishes<br>
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency<br>
I’ll never even get to see<br>
This fast life soon shatter us<br>
Cause after all the lights and screams<br>
Nothing but my dreams matter<br>
Hoping for better days<br>
Maybe a peaceful night, baby don’t cry<br>
Cause everythang gonna be alright<br>
Just lay your head on my shoulder<br>
Don’t worry bout a thang baby<br>
Girl I’m a soldier (huh)<br>
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was<br>
You still came with that, unconditional love</p>
<p>[Chorus 3x until fade][/code]</p>
<p>Oh and its the fact that he was shot, on purpose that makes people so angry Princess Diana could of been an accident and same with Nicole kidman.</p>
<p>I have been listening 2 tupac since i was 5 years old as my dad does aswell. Even my mum who laughs at most rap knows tupac wasnt a normal rapper.</p>
