    <title>My ideas on why women fail</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-ideas-on-why-women-fail/214787</link>
    <description>for a while iv been thinking of why women fail compared to men,

we out-earn and out-compete them,
on average, women get better marks at school, but when you look at the truly exceptional students, they are all guys, 

men and women are different, there is no denying that,

so iv come up with an idea of why it&#39;s like this,

it comes down to do two things.
1. sex is the main driving force of the human race, it motivates us better then anything else, everyone iv spoken to has agreed, i got it from [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud]Sigmund Freud[/url]

2. men want sex more then women,

(in a naive sense) women always get more attention when it comes to getting a dude, men have to fight each other for the girl, and women are always more likely to be able to choose between many guys,


the idea is, since men want it more, they have more motivation then women,
and with that motivation, comes a powerful urge to win at life, the man says &quot;I [i]will[/i] get a good job, I [i]will[/i] study for this exam, I [i]will[/i] get a good sense of humour, I [i]will[/i] do [i]something[/i] to get a good woman&quot;

with women, they also do all that stuff, but have much less motivation then men, so in a competition between men and women, men will mostly come out on top,
also, if a man fails at life, he is history, gone, dead,
if a woman fails, not all is lost, as she can try to find a rich man,

a man&#39;s urge can go quite wrong too, instead of trying to succeed at life, he might just think, &quot;I&#39;m not going to get a good job, ill just hang around in the park, and try to get my first shag!&quot;
these men fail even worse then women, and its true there are more male prisoners and all that, 

women are generally &quot;average&quot;, men can either be &quot;very bad&quot;, &quot;very good&quot; or anything in between, but they&#39;ll always want to be better then they are, they have the motivation to be better, which women have much less of,

so in short,
men have much more motivation to succeed then women do, thats why women are more likely to do worse off then men,


i find it very funny how some women say things like,
&quot;Men think of sex once every 30 seconds&quot; and &quot;Men only want sex&quot;

whats so funny is that they say it like its a [i]bad[/i] thing, which is not right at all,

if my theory is right, men being so occupied with sex is our greatest strength, its the reason for our success!


also, my theory implies that porn and fap is a waste,
anything which reduces or satisfies your desire for sex gives you less motivation to succeed at life, 
ever since I&#39;ve thought of this, iv tried to keep off the porn, 



I&#39;ve also thought about [i]why[/i] women want sex so much less,
its probably because of biology, the purpose of sex is to reproduce, and a woman contributes much more to a child then a man does,
so a woman is going to be much more choosy in who she sleeps with,
therefore, thats why women want sex less, and therefore they fail because of it,

if man was the one who carried a child and gave birth, man would be the one to fail,



So men of this forum, don&#39;t be ashamed of your urges, they are your greatest powers and they will make you win!


anyway, so what do you think of my ideas and all that, 
my ideas kind of build on Evolutionary Biology and Psychology, and my own experiences,
also, point out any flaws or anything you see, and ill try to rethink that part to make it good again</description>

              <p>well, the first line was correct,</p>
<p>the second line is just an implication, like “The universe is expanding” implies “The universe had a beginning”<br>
when i mentioned it, everyone seized on it and posted a lot about it, even though its a small part of it, maybe thats why you were confused,</p>
<p>the third line has nothing to do with it, i’m not trying to solve <span class="bbcode-b">why</span> men or women are here, i guess you could say both men and women are only for reproducing, if you look in a biological sense. In another sense we’re here for other reasons, like in a religious sense, we’re here to serve god.</p>

Personally I would pay to help someone IF and ONLY IF they have a job that is 80% sustainable in their lives, and only for 3 months; by that time they could get a second part-time job.</p>
