    <description> Title says all 

Ive been trying to look for tutorials on how to make mods etc. and i couldnt find any so im down to asking questions can somebody please tell me how to make a person / Mod or Admin. I thought i may of have to go to the characters folder in the server source folder and if i change the person&#39;s name ie. Mystic Range i would change it to say - 2 which is staff. and then i look again after i saved its back to player rights =0 can somebody help me please a link to a tutorial would be a saviour.

Thanks The 007 Reaper</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>You go into the Character file, then double-click on the character you wan’t to modify.  To make them have higher rights, you should change their playerRights to one of the following;</p>
<p>1 = Moderator</p>
<p>2 = Administrator</p>
<p>3 = Owner</p>
<p>The owner doesn’t necessarily have any powers over an Administrator but you can make them have more powers.  Save the character file and you’re done.  Make sure the player is logged out because if they are logged in and they log out in ordor to have the rights, their file will save and the rights will go back to the usual.</p>
