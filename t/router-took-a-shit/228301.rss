    <title>Router took a shIT</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/router-took-a-shit/228301</link>
    <description>I had a server online, my first server, with a DLink router. I managed to portforward finally, after trying to remember the routers password. Day 3 of my server being up 24/7, my router fried. I got a linksys router, and I followed the guide on portforward.com and the guide in the tutorials section on how to portforward it. I did everything correctly. It is also allowed in my firewall. 

I am thinking its the ip address that makes you connect to it, but it doesn&#39;t work. When I portforwarded the DLink, I looked at my start&gt;connect to&gt;wireless network connection, clicked advanced and the ipaddress that was there worked on there. Now with a new router, it says the same thing but it doesn&#39;t work. 

Help please</description>
