<p>When you turn the server off and try to connect, does it say "Error connecting to server"<br>
because if so, the client is at least connecting to the server, but the server is rejecting it.</p>
<p>You’d have to find out why. It can be a lot of things.<br>
The first things I’d check are:<br>
the UID (Typically found in signlink and is sent to the server in the login method of client.java)<br>
the Magic id (Sent upon login, usually set to 255 or 317).<br>
RSA (Found in Stream.java of the client. Look for two BigIntegers. if they don’t exist, you don’t have it)</p>

<p>Please give them the correct answer.</p>
<p>To know where the cache belongs, they should search for findcachedir() in signlink.java within the client.<br>
Typically, it’s the second result in the file.</p>
<p>Make sure your cache is in the appropriate folder.<br>
If it has a string that starts with “C:” then the cache goes into your c drive.<br>
if it has a string like “.” then the cache <span class="bbcode-b">folder</span> belongs in the same folder as your .class files for your client.<br>
if it has a string like “user.home” then it will go into your user folder (Typically on windows 7 it’s C:\Users\Your-Username)<br>
[/quote] You just restated what beale said lol[/quote]<br>
Beale said the cache goes into the C drive, and then stated to look in the signlink.<br>
It’s easier to just look in the signlink and the place the cache appropriately.</p>

One of the paths (Probably to some sprites) is not set correctly. Make sure anything that was loading from the cache has been changed to use the signlink.findcachedir() method.<br>
You can check by searching the cache name in the folder… And then editing the files it shows up in. client.java and Sprite.java would be a start.</p>

<p>Have you made sure that all your paths are correct and are finding the cache in the correct directory? It would also help to know where your cache is being loaded from.</p>
