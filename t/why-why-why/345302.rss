    <description>Why is it that most 500+ Servers i Run i get the Js5connect error? Servers online and not online, example:

So i found 2 nice 562 servers being hosted, its been awhile since i&#39;ve played on online, well i have CorruptionX and boxrune 562, i&#39;ve downloaded both, 2 times, extracted and ran. When ir un it they both wont go any farther then checking for updates, at the begging, and it sits there for 2-3 mins and freezes and when you look at the prompt, which boxrune has one that shows up, it gives me Error_game_js5connect. What the fuck is wrong with this? Every time i run a 508+ tbh it does that..WHY?

What can i do to fix it..??

please reply if you can help,
thanks</description>
