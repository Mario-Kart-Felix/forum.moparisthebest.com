    <title>[RSCali] - Adding Grand Exchange [Warning Window]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscali-adding-grand-exchange-warning-window/448990</link>
    <description>Ok so I have been trying to add GE to the RSCali Base server and it is proving to be a pretty big pain in the ass -- which is why I made an account here finally lol.

So I have the interface up, I am sending the correct configs -- that I know of [1109, 1110, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1114].
I dont think that I need to send the 1115 or 1116 because Min and Max were removed from RuneScape to allow for the &quot;Custom Price&quot;.

So I have it set up so you can click &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;sell&quot; and for whatever reason when you click &quot;Sell&quot; this is what it shows:
[IMG]http://img809.imageshack.us/img809/2153/rspsge.png[/img]

I have tried modifying all config settings from 1109 - 1120.
I have also tried making the current buy price [1111] higher than the current sell price [1114] -- but that also didn&#39;t work.

This is stalled development on my Grand Exchange lol and I just need some help.
Also -- the current interface that I am using is [105].

Thanks for the future responses!  :)

EDIT:
To clear this up, I want that &quot;Warning!&quot; bullshit gone lol. I just need to know if anyone else knows how to remove that child component forever. Also -- it is part of the main Interface 105 so I cant just close out of the interface -- I think.</description>
