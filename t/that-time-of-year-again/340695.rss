    <description>EXAM TIME. Brilliant. I&#39;m finishing my A levels in IT, English and History, and I&#39;m hoping for straight B&#39;s to go to Leicester Uni. I have my first exam tomorrow in IT, and don&#39;t have English and History until mid/late July. Nice long study break :)

What&#39;s everyone got exams in and what&#39;s next? 

Goodluck to everyone taking exams as well - very stressful period.</description>

<p>thepinksock/Radeon link me to that question and I’ll see if I can figure it out for you if you don’t already know.[/quote]</p>
<p>What’s wrong with History and English? History is pretty damn interesting. I did American history this year and I absolutely loved it…makes me wish I chose to do it for a degree. AND I got a trip to Boston with it as well, which was even cooler. English is just plain boring, but it’s something that I’m naturally good at (apart from the literature side of the course :()</p>
<p>Anyway, I’ve finished all my exams now, just waiting on results and looking for some full-time work. With any luck I’ll be at Leicester Uni in a few months!</p>
