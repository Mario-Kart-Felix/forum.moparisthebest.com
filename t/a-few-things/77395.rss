    <title>A Few Things</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-things/77395</link>
    <description>Alright, these things are really getting on my nerves
-The Variable For Cure Poison?
I.E. I have &quot;Poisoned = false;&quot;, It compiles fine, but I&#39;m still poisoned? Is this the correct variable? HELP PLEASE
-Changing The Maximum Ammount Of Experience?
I.E. People stop gaining experience at around 14,500,000, it&#39;s not exactly that number, so I can&#39;t just find it and edit it, is there a way to make it so they NEVER stop gaining experience? or is there a way to make it so they don&#39;t stop gaining experience until around 999m xp?
-.cfg files not working?
I.E. objects.cfg npcdrops.cfg and drops.cfg do nothing when i edit them, even when they compile perfectly, help? :(

Thanks in advance to all of you who can help[br][size=1]Posted on: April 09, 2007, 02:19:29 PM[/size][hr]No Help?...Brilliant...</description>
