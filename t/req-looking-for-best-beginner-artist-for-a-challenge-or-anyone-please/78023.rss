[u][b]Introduction[/b][/u]
I&#39;m only saying this to see what all I can do with my art, I want to make somethen out of this for fun and also improve my ability in art. I&#39;m willing to prove to myself that I am in great quality of a competitive artist with these people who think they got what it takes to be a great artist on these forums(anywhere really). Show out your work and give me the best you&#39;ve got, I dont want any picture that you say you&#39;ve played around with. I just wanna see what I can do with this, because I&#39;m in 8th grade going to 9th and I want to be much better when I get in 9th. So what ever you make is your best on this post:
