    <description>Right now I have a GeForce 8800 GTS w/ 640mb GDDR3 ram, PCI x16.  It performs pretty well, I can play just about everything at high settings, like the new Crysis 2 at full, but not quite the original Crysis.  Dragon Age played at full, Doom 3, Quake 4 and the like did too.  

What I am getting at, is I don&#39;t know whether I could get a significant improvement for around $150 or less or not.  I see quite a few 450s, 460s, and 550s and 560s in that price range, but my previous experience with 5600s, 7600s etc tells me they are far worse than the X800/X80 range performance wise, and maybe I&#39;d be better off getting a 280 GTX or something?  What would you recommend?  Or should I just wait until the 480/580 gets cheaper?

If you want to know what other hardware I&#39;m running, it is this, with the ASUS mobo, not the MSI:

              <p>Just got a GTX560 in and installed it in my computer, here are performance tests ran with the same driver just before and just after switching cards.  The 8800GTS killed the GTX560 in 2d graphics performance, but the GTX560 killed the 8800GTS in 3d graphics performance, I find that strange.  Can anyone enlighten me as to why that is?</p>

</aside>
<p>Efficiency and newer tech I’m not worried about, just performance and cost.  I’ll probably stick with Nvidia because of the driver issue you mentioned, because if I remember one thing about the ATI Radeon 9600 in the laptop, getting the drivers to work for Linux was a pain in the ass, and Nvidia drivers work perfectly.</p>

              <p>ATI have improved massively. When they brought out the 5000 series cards, and then NVIDIA brought their initial 400 series cards (470 and 480), ATI’s cards were reviewed considerably better for price to performance, and efficiency.</p>
<p>Nvidia have brought it back with the 500 series cards, and at the top end have better performance - but overall, I’d say you wouldn’t go wrong with buying either brand of card these days.</p>
<p>An example for the top end single GPUs from both sides, while you may not be looking for those specifically - it is a good indication of the quality of both brands now:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/305?vs=292" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/305?vs=292</a> (play around with the various benchmark categories on the left) - As you can see, the 6970 does well against it. The prices:</p>
<p>NVIDIA 580: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127567&amp;cm_re=Nviida_580-" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127567&amp;cm_re=Nviida_580-</a><em>-14-127-567-</em>-Product ($499)</p>

<p>NVIDIA still has the better drivers, but ATI are also improving. There are still some annoyances, but having had my 5850s since they came out in 2009 I’ve seen them improve and haven’t had any significant problem with them.</p>

<p>I mean, it depends what level of performance you expect. I have to be able to play all my games at max settings at around 60fps. So I have my two 5850s and even then, there are the odd one or two games where I have to bump down the AA or AF to keep it above 60.</p>

<p>You probably bought it awhile ago at that price, my brother just got a GTX480 for $350, but I don’t want to spend that much.</p>
<p>I guess in a nutshell, what I am asking, is will I get better framerates and be able to max everything out upgrading to a 450/460 or a 550/560 from an 8800GTS, or will it just get me fancier looking graphics because of supporting the newer technologies and little to no improvement performance-wise?</p>
<p>Is there a website I can compare card performance side by side on?</p>

              <p>Right now I have a GeForce 8800 GTS w/ 640mb GDDR3 ram, PCI x16.  It performs pretty well, I can play just about everything at high settings, like the new Crysis 2 at full, but not quite the original Crysis.  Dragon Age played at full, Doom 3, Quake 4 and the like did too.</p>
<p>What I am getting at, is I don’t know whether I could get a significant improvement for around $150 or less or not.  I see quite a few 450s, 460s, and 550s and 560s in that price range, but my previous experience with 5600s, 7600s etc tells me they are far worse than the X800/X80 range performance wise, and maybe I’d be better off getting a 280 GTX or something?  What would you recommend?  Or should I just wait until the 480/580 gets cheaper?</p>
<p>If you want to know what other hardware I’m running, it is this, with the ASUS mobo, not the MSI:<br>
