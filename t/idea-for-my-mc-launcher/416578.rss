    <title>Idea for my mc launcher</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/idea-for-my-mc-launcher/416578</link>
    <description>I believe by now it is a well known fact that my launcher will not update on its own. After deleting the bin folder,  it will update fine. I have made a java cmd program that logs in using the newest launchers method. I get a session,  newest version,  and a download ticket. None of this except the newest version has to be dynamic in the launcher. 

Idea:
I can get the values from a php page from the launcher and make the auto update process. The issue I would have is writing a php page that can write said value to a text file. 
Say my script navigated to &#39;http://example.com/setver.php?val=fhg74d&#39; it would write that val to the file. Before you say anything,  that is how Notch does his versions.

Anybody think this would be a good idea? It would enable a 100% working cracked launcher yes,  but I know less people would buy minecraft. I am mostly asking for an idea of improvement. Not help as i am sure there is a guide on google that would work for most of this.  versions.

              <p>i’m currently working on a server, i’ll be having a custom launcher(doing some cleaning up atm), and authentication server(done).</p>
<p>how i update the client: i use MD5 check sum of minecraft.jar and post it to my website, that checks if the latest MD5 check sum equals the check sum posted. if they’re the same, it will launch the game, if they’re not, it will update.</p>

<p>Didn’t realize this was a cracked launcher, thought it was one of those shitty custom minecraft launchers.</p>

<p>Aka the reason auto updating is hard? If all i did was make a custom launcher with valid logging in and such it would be useless and easier to make. I have to do a workaround like this for a reason lol.</p>

              <p>I guess I’ll start doing the PHP and small amount of scripting tonight.  I’ll try to setup a cronjob to be ran every hour to update the version if changed. Just found out I may be a father in 7-8 months so i won’t be sleeping tonight <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: I have the PHP pages setup and working. Password protected the page to be able to set the password, although someone smart enough could easily get that pass. I am working on the launcher to add in the new feature now.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Finished it all up. If anybody wants to use it, here is the link:<br>
