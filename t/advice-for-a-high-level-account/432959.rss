Money: 4,641,617GP/4641K/4M.

I really don&#39;t know what I should aim for in the other levels. All I want to do for now is get 90 attack, 99 strength, 90 defence. Should I do that or work on the lower level skills?</description>

<p>[quote=“Mod Reach”]Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I’m currently investigating the Right Click Disconnections so many of you are currently having.</p>
<p>Whilst a fix was put in place, it still seems a large quantity of you are having issues. For me to get a better idea of how many are still affected. Can you please post below with the following information about your disconnection.</p>
<ul>
<li>World &amp; Where?</li>
<li>What did you right click?</li>
<li>Screen resolution and display mode (Fixed, resizable, DirectX/OpenGL etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>This will help me better determine the cause and the solution to the problem. All posts are automatically hidden and cannot be edited so please only make ONE POST per person and try to include all you can in the original post.</p>

<p>I’ve just tried to kick your accounts but it appears the world you were using has gone offline.</p>
<p>I’ve also tried manually releasing them but it appears the server has a firm grip on you at the moment.</p>
<p>When a world goes down, it locks itself for about 15 minutes so after 15 mins from when it first went down, to when it releases is when you’ll be able to log back in.</p>
<p>Apologies for that and I’ll see what I can do about the world itself. :)[/quote]</p>
