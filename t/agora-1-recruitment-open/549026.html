<p>[SIZE=3][U]My Background[/U][/SIZE]</p>
<p>So I’m 21, I currently help manage a large business with over 1,400 customers on “memberships”. I’ve played Runescape since 2004 and honestly I can’t remember exactly when I started RSPS’s but it wasn’t too long after. I’ve got a lot of actual tangible real life experience with running projects and a business as well as having the more boring but very important knowledge too which came with an A at A-Level in the subject several years ago.</p>
<p>I have also recently invested £1,600 in a new computer so I have the ability to host a large BETA Server for testing alongside the main VPS run server. I’ve got experience running an RSPS before but it was more of a bit of fun back then, this to me is my baby of a project and I will treat it like a business for the most efficiency.</p>

<p>[/tr]<br>
[/table]</p>
<p>[SPOILER=Further Information][COLOR=blue]Client &amp; Base:[/COLOR] We haven’t decided on a Client Revision just yet however due to high demand from a variety of different revisions, however it’ll be between 474 and 600; most likely towards the 500 end though. Agora’s base is decided though and it will the highly anticipated Asteria 3.0 once it’s released by our very own Head Developer [user]Lare96[/user], the previous Asteria 2.0 was a massive hit if you wanted an impeccable base then 2.0 certainly wasn’t far off the mark and it’s in my personal opinion the best base an RSPS can use and I know a lot of great developers would agree. I cannot disclose any further information on the Asteria 3.0 project as it’s not my place to do so but what I can tell you is it’s definitely one to look out for!</p>
<p>[COLOR=blue]Economy, XP Rate &amp; Features:[/COLOR] As for the economy of a server, we feel that this is an extremely important part of Agora and we’ll be taking many measures in order to ensure that we maintain a strong economy without just being another one of those RSPS’s that you just get bored with. We’ll offer the basics for the player and they’ll need go through a variety of fun and engaging activities in order to reach their goals! The XP rate is currently undecided however we don’t believe on having an extremely low nor high XP rate, we will most likely go for a happy medium but most likely it will be leaning towards the lower XP rate end; but don’t worry we’ll be very careful to ensure that you don’t find levelling much of a chore at all and if you want to PK early on then you’ll certainly be able too pretty much from the get-go thanks to a unique system we’ll be implementing!</p>
<p>[COLOR=blue]Features &amp; Content Base:[/COLOR] As for the players that are more into their PvM, we’ll be bringing new twists to fully working minigames that we’re sure you will be enthralled by as well as many other bits and bobs for you guys to stay entertained and also to make that all important GP! Yes you heard correct, GP will be worth something on Agora; that’s absolutely paramount to us. So the content of Agora will be based on 2008 as you know, I’ve taken the time too write up a quick list detailing what was released and when for you. It doesn’t include all the updates but it should include most of the main additions to the game so you know what won’t be in Agora and what will be in Agora (At least to begin with, we may add certain content that was very close to 2008 but we’ll be keeping well clear of the most modern items). [URL=http://“<a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/help/580135-your-favourite-year-rs-poll-exluding-graphics.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/google/help/580135-your-favourite-year-rs-poll-exluding-graphics.html</a>”]here[/URL] it is.</p>
<p>[COLOR=blue]Hosting:[/COLOR] Agora will be ran by a VPS from the get go in order to provide the community with a stable and responsive experience, as players and subsequently demand increases we shall upgrade the VPS to well above the required standard. This is in order to be extra safe that we don’t ever hit the point where the server has hit it’s limit and is beginning to cause distress to our community. Because at the end of the day without you guys, Agora is nothing and we do genuinely understand that and wish to prove it to you.</p>
<p>[COLOR=blue]Forum:[/COLOR] Next up, the forum is as I’m sure you lot know an extremely important part of the puzzle when it comes to most games, but especially RSPS’s. Trying to start an RSPS without a forum is just like attempting to start your car without it’s engine, it’s not going to start; let alone get you to where you want it to go.</p>
<p>If there is anything more that you wish to ask then I and my team will be more than happy to answer your questions. Please scroll down to the bottom for contact details.[/spoiler]</p>
<p>[HR]</p>
<p>[U][SIZE=3]Research[/SIZE][/U]</p>
<p>For the past two months I’ve been collecting research for my RSPS. This research has been taken from a variety of different places in order for it not to be biased, I’ve collated all of this research into several spread sheets that continue to be imperative in interpreting what you guys want! I understand that I can’t be everything to everyone but I believe I can still get everyone interested in Agora no matter what you’re RSPS preference is, this will be due to many aspects of Agora such as impeccable development, FUN twists on old content, FUN twists on new content and the ability to choose from many different paths to gradually get to your goals!</p>
<p>[HR]</p>
<p>[U][SIZE=3]Agora’s Budget[/SIZE][/U]</p>
<p>I’m going to be investing a fair amount into Agora in order to make it an RSPS of the highest calibre around. I feel very passionately about this project and I know it will be a great investment for me and also for the community as Agora will bring them something that they can truly relish.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">Lare69</span> our Head Developer. He’s a tutorial author and the creator of the very well known Asteria sources (v1.0 - 3.0). Many RSPS’s currently use his sources and are still creating content using them as a base because of the exquisite quality of work and effort that he puts into all of his work. Some of Lare96’s work is listed below if you’re interested but much more can be found if you research him yourself as he posts most his work elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">SeventhSense</span> is 21 years old and currently doing a bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at a high ranking university.</p>
<p>He has worked on countless RS related projects and as a result is highly proficient in Java. He has also worked on many other projects outside of RSPS’s too, for example right now he’s working on a Runescape bot which involves a lot of byte code manipulation and server/client programming.</p>
<p>He’s also worked with big data sets and is currently working on a project with some of the lecturers at his university on a distributed cloud computing service with funding of 2 million. However this project is almost finished and now he’s ready to jump in and work on Agora with all his expertise!</p>

Although we’ll have an in depth discussion with you before to check if you’re capable of the high standard we require so don’t worry. This way you’re not wasting our time and we’re not wasting yours.

<p>Not to sound like a dick, but are you sure the project he’s participating in is credible? It’s a big step down from a 2 million dollar project to a small, not-yet-developed RSPS. It’s not particularly the direction I’d want to be headed after a project like that.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, good luck with this. It seems to get better every time I see a thread of yours about this.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, good luck with this. It seems to get better every time I see a thread of yours about this.[/quote]</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind feedback Si Force, in response to your question; I too was sceptical about that too however I probed deeper and it held true. Plus he’s been questioned thoroughly to see if he’s knowledgeable and he excelled through this stage of the application process like the rest. He’s always been into RSPS’s and he wants to use his expertise to help create an excellent experience for the community, this is a big hobby of his and he wanted to work with the great developers that are experienced when it comes to RSPS’s such as Lare and some others we’re currently interviewing too. So he doesn’t view it as a step down but I can see where you’re coming from. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Thank you, have a good day.</p>
