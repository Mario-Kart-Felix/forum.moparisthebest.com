    <description>I am making a bounty hunter type place but in my own way. I wanted it where you spawn where there are 3 caves like bounty for lvl 3-40, 40-90 and 90-126. Once you go through the cave, you are teleported to an area in wild somewhere, I want it whenever you kill a person, you get 500k as a reward. Also whenever you die, you get teleported to the place where the 3 caves are. I don&#39;t really care if it safe pk zone or not. I just want to know how to make a certain place a different death spot and reward as pk</description>

          <blockquote>
              <p>well for the death place you would need to create something like</p>
<p>Public void Bountydeath ()<br>
Teleportx: x coord<br>
teleporty: y coord</p>
<p>And Then have it there if you die inside the bounty hunter area then:<br>
Public void bountydeath ()</p>
<p>And for the 500K reward, make another void called something like:</p>
<p>public void Bountykill ()<br>
Additem (995, 500000)</p>
<p>Then when you kill some1 inside the bounty area:<br>
public void bountykill ()</p>
