    <title>Terrorism and Propaganda</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/terrorism-and-propaganda/74568</link>
    <description>Labelling events as acts of &quot;Terrorism&quot; is a propaganda effort by the government to control the population and/or allow the government to pursue globalization and/or the private interests of politicians. &quot;Terrorist Attacks&quot; are often not what they seem. Directly after many major terrorist attacks civil rights were rolled back. Examples below.


The [url=http://demopedia.democraticunderground.com/index.php/Oklahoma_Bombing]Oklahoma City Bombing[/url] was a terrorist attack on a government building in Oklahoma City.


&lt;blockquote&gt;In January 1997, ABC 20/20 reported that the government had prior knowledge of the of the Oklahoma City bombing. In February, a Time magazine article reported that the ATF had advance warning from one of its own informants.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you are interested, you might read this article at disinfo: [url=http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/article/id2461/pg1/index.html]oklahoma city bombing: startling evidence proves government cover-up.[/url]


In response the bombing in 1996 the government passed the The Antiterrorism Act of 1996.
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the Act removed barriers to FBI investigation of activities protected under the First Amendment. It also removed some restrictions on the famous FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Court--where federal judges sit in secret to consider, and mostly approve, Justice Department requests for widespread surveillance of &quot;terrorists,&quot; including pen registers and &quot;trap-and-trace&quot; surveillance, methods that can capture income and outgoing telephone calls. The law also opened the door for the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport mostly Muslim citizens. The deportations were based on largely secret evidence, and no overt acts needed to be alleged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [url=http://demopedia.democraticunderground.com/index.php/9/11]September 11[/url] terrorist attacks on the United States involved hijacked airplanes being crashed into the Twin Towers and the pentagon.


[url=http://demopedia.democraticunderground.com/index.php/9/11_inside_traders]Insider[/url]   trading shows that some had foreknowledge of 9/11. 


[url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,249997,00.html]A memo [/url] from FBI agent Coleen Rowley to the director of the FBI shows that investigation into terrorists who would later carry out 9/11 were halted internally.


[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5q2DO7ofnQ&amp;mode=related&amp;search=]Media[/url] reports have shown the attacks were preventable if procedure had been followed.


&lt;blockquote&gt;Just 45 days after the September 11 attacks, with virtually no debate, Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act. There are significant flaws in the Patriot Act, flaws that threaten your fundamental freedoms by giving the government the power to access to your medical records, tax records, information about the books you buy or borrow without probable cause, and the power to break into your home and conduct secret searches without telling you for weeks, months, or indefinitely.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
http://www.aclu.org/safefree/resources/17343res20031114.html


&lt;blockquote&gt;The Act expanded &quot;guilt by association&quot; to the point that the most tenuous connection to an organization labeled by the Secretary of State as a &quot;terrorist&quot; organization can now lead to the charge of conspiring, or taking action to, give &quot;material support&quot; to &quot;aid and abet&quot; terrorism.&lt;/blockquote&gt;



To encourage support for the Patriot Act the government created this website:
http://www.lifeandliberty.gov/

Now, assuming that terrorism is a hoax to achieve certain objectives, websites like lifeandliberty and

http://www.defendamerica.mil/

can be seen as blatant propaganda.

<p>I don’t think so.</p>
<blockquote>One reason mankind went into farming was that hunting and fishing don't supply enough food for a very large population nor do they work during times of drought or climatic disruption. What does he do when he runs out of ammunition or game? What happens if the streams become so contaminated that he can't safely eat what he catches? Can he stake out a large enough area to guarantee that he won't depleat it of game so that the next year is not barren of animals?</blockquote>

<p>Maybe, but do you think people would be united? Look at New Orleans as an example of when the government institutes martial law. You had cops looting wal-marts, the elderly and sick largely abandoned, hundreds of random shootings, etc…In a time of disaster everyone will look after themselves. Some people won’t realize what’s going on and concentrate on grabbing the largest flatscreen TV possible…even when there’s no electricity and no hope of it coming back on in the near future.</p>
<blockquote>A maximum wage would be good, but how the hell would you abolish the military? The latter is the stupidest idea I have ever heard.</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know how we could abolish the military…you’re the one suggesting it above, with your “The people would win there are more of us” idea. Hell, I’d join your militia any day, you seem fearless and ballsy enough.</p>

<p>They may have bigger guns, but the people would still win, there are more of us. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/hex">@Hex</a> Key, but if the guns in your country are sufficiently controlled (aren’t they?) there are not that many available for you to get a hold of, and if the government wanted to take over, it would be too little, too late.</p>

<p>A maximum wage would be good, but how the hell would you abolish the military? The latter is the stupidest idea I have ever heard.</p>

<p>You have guns, but the government has a private mercenary force (<a href="http://www.blackwaterusa.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.blackwaterusa.com/</a>) and bigger guns. Also, thanks to the Oklahoma City Bombing they have plenty of anti-militia regulation. What happens to people who want to live in freedom, freedom supported by high powered weapons?

<p>Well, I hope it can protect you Mopar, I really do. But as I said before, you can’t eat bullets. The American dollar is a fiat currency, and sadly it’s not really worth diddley squat anymore. The endless credit system in the United States combined with a nonexistent manufacturing base are a perfect recipe for disaster.</p>
