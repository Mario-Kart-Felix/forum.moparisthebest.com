    <title>Server Advertisements Board</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-advertisements-board/534820</link>
    <description>As much attention as the Server Advertisement board gets I believe there should be child boards something like

-Server Advertisements
--194-474
--474-562
--598-700+

The reasoning for this is two reasons:

1) would make it easier for people to navigate servers that they actually want to play
2) Organization 

Other thoughts: Personally I don&#39;t play 474-562 and I was kind of hesitant of making a 3rd child board there but people like Ash do originate from those types so thought it would be a good addition just in case. 

Maybe instead of 194-317 it should be like 194-498 and then 508-634?</description>

<p>server help aspect it’s all java but different naming/structure.<br>
if you know the basics of the server you work with, people can use broad terms. “combat handling class, item handling class, click item packet” etc</p>
<p>advertising on the other hand, would actually be split up by revision due to that being a main focal point of the server.</p>

<p>But no seriously I do agree with Flame the prefix tags would be a good addition. The issue is that a lot of times you just can’t tell what is what with all the revisions being pushed in the same category.</p>

              <p>I don’t think creating more boards for the sake of organisation is a good idea. Sure, it’ll help users searching for a server, however it is easier for thread creators to add a prefix in their title like [317], [474], etc. I’m sure a mod could potentially be added to accommodate this when the forum upgrades even.</p>
<p>All in all, there’s no point in watering down the board for the sake of organisation, it creates more moderation which can be avoided through different methods.</p>

You can always close the main server advertisement board so it can’t be used or for that matter if a person isn’t sure they can always post it on the main board to be moved. I also don’t think you are giving even the leechers enough credit. NORMALLY when they download a 718 vs. a 317 they at least know that cause that’s what they searched for.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong I want to make the volunteer moderators have as much free time as possible but it can be difficult sometimes to navigate the board.</p>
<p>Edit: also if a person spams a board with an advertisement they are going to get some form of disciplinary action anyway.I would assume the same would happen to people who make multiple accounts for “new” servers and constantly post in the incorrect section ~^</p>

              <p>As much attention as the Server Advertisement board gets I believe there should be child boards something like</p>
<p>-Server Advertisements<br>
–194-474<br>
–474-562<br>
–598-700+</p>
<p>The reasoning for this is two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>would make it easier for people to navigate servers that they actually want to play</li>
<li>Organization</li>
</ol>
<p>Other thoughts: Personally I don’t play 474-562 and I was kind of hesitant of making a 3rd child board there but people like Ash do originate from those types so thought it would be a good addition just in case.</p>
<p>Maybe instead of 194-317 it should be like 194-498 and then 508-634?</p>
