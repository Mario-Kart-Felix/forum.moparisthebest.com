    <description> Hi.
 I am Silabmods (MadX) and me and my team ( 24byt ) need some new coders, doesnt mater how much you know if you wana learn some new things. 
 
 About [url=http://24byt.smfforfree3.com/index.php]24byt[/url]:
 24byt is a team that is creating server bases for everyone.
 Even if we didn&#39;t posted any of our sources on mopar that not means we don&#39;t have any.
 We are trying to make them very easy to use and edit, for all coders.
 We need some help with some things, that are easy but takes to long to be made. 
 We are trying to teach other people not with C+P tutorials, by working on a source with other people that know some things about coding.
 We giv easy tasks, so that everyone can do theyr job. We also giv optional jobs, that can be made when ever you want.   

 Hope you like 24byt  :)
