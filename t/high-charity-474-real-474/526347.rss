Now let me just clear some things up before we get started here. 
[list]
[li][i]What base are you using, good sir?[/i]
I will be using Hyperion, project insanity and all of its derivatives are garbage.
[/li][/list][i][/i]

[list][li][i]Are you using a blank Hyperion, or a source which already has features in it?[/i]
I couldn&#39;t do something with a blank hyperion except delete it from my hard drive.
I am using rs2-server.[/li]
[li][i]How far do you plan on going with this project?[/i]
Hopefully all the way, meaning hosting it as well.
[/li]
[li][i]How long have you been working on this base?[/i]
On and off since late 2010.[/li]
[li][i]Can I have staff?[/i]
Get lost[/li]
[/list]

[center]Now for a bit of background on this.
I began working on this server around when rs474 was released, and when I began, I was making almost no progress, I didn&#39;t know much about java, so anything I did wasn&#39;t really an achievement, but over time, I learned more from this base, and was able to do more and more things. Slowly, but surely, I moved up with it, trying to improve content in any way possible. And here we are today.

TLDR Base helped me learn still using it[/center]


[b][size=24pt]MEET THE TEAM[/size][/b]

[li]Pure - CPO and MCE[/li]
[li]Casey. - Marketing/Funding/Copyright protection[/li]

[/list]
Even though they are not a part of our team &#39;officially&#39;, I would like to welcome Bootnecklad and c|p to our teams, for each of them have donated over $500 each to our cause! You have our undying gratitude.
[list]
[li][i]What do you want to achieve with this?[/i]
The thing is, what I see with private servers all the time is everything is handled in millions of gp, very high leveled weapons, and all of the good things we know are left behind. That is why I&#39;m trying to redesign the weapon and armor system for all 3 types of combat.

For example, Leather and Hard Leather would be lower level range AND melee armor
At level 20 defense, You would get bronze.
30 - Iron
40 - Steel
50 - Black
60 - Mithril
70 - Adamant
80 - Rune 
90 - Dragon
So on so forth, and this will be done with all the classes.
[/li]
[/list]
[list]
[li][i]But the stats on those lower level things suck, thats kind of why we dont use them.[/i]
Exactly! Which is why I plan on adjusting the bonuses for these items to better match their required level.[/li]
[/list]
[center][size=18pt][color=red]To do[/size][/center]
[list]
[li]Boss scripts (DONE)
Currently, these are VERY VERY flawed. And I don&#39;t mean as in exploits, I mean the way bosses are named.
If you are familiar with rs2server then you would know that npc combat definitions are loaded from an xml file (Or at least mine is and some others that I&#39;ve seen if not all of them) and to make a boss, you must put the attack type as CUSTOM in the npcs definition, and you write a boss script for it.
But what does this have to do with anything, you may ask?
Take a look at this:
[/li][/list]deleted[list]
This is the code which defines combat type in the xml file, obviously MELEE RANGE and MAGE should be self explanatory. But lets take a closer look at CUSTOM.
As you can see, it looks for the boss scripts at org &gt; rs2server &gt; rs2 &gt; model &gt; combat &gt; npcs, and for .class files.
The next part is for the server to find out how to find the correct class for each npc id, it does this by grabbing the actual text name of the npc, and replacing spaces with no space at all.

[/list]
[list]
[li][i]What is so bad about this?[/i]
The fact that it finds the npcs boss script via name. If you don&#39;t know already, some npcs in the game share names, like lets say the npc &quot;ghost&quot;.
You make a boss script for this &quot;ghost&quot; npc but want to make another one for another npc with a different npc id, unfortunately this one is also named &quot;ghost&quot;, so what happens? It gets the script from the first npc&#39;s boss script. This is a problem for me especially since a certain npc I use has a few different ids, with the same name, and I need to make boss scripts for these IDs as well, but they would all share one, now whats the point in that? Also, it is broken for things like jad, the name is &quot;TzTok-Jad&quot;, the &quot;-&quot; messes it up. Now I don&#39;t know if I just did something wrong, but I tried replacing &quot;-&quot; with &quot;&quot; in the same place where spaces are replaced, but that actually ruined it and none of the boss scripts would be loaded.
[/li]
[li][i]How do you plan on fixing this?[/i]
Well good question eager forum user, instead of using an npc name to find an npc id&#39;s boss script, I use the [i]actual[/i] ID. So for example, instead of something like kingblackdragon.class, it would be 50.class 50 being its npc id. This gets rid of the problem of having npcs with the same names [u][i]AND[/i][/u] npcs with more complex names like tzhaar monsters, and any other out there if there are, this way, even if you could make specific hard coded exceptions in the CombatNPCDefinition, you wouldn&#39;t need to clutter it up uselessly, when it can be solved like this, now I know what some of you are thinking, that numbers would be more confusing. Not exactly, if I work on something for a while, I will quickly learn the id, considering how much I spawn it, open the file, so on so forth. So this is beneficial to me, but maybe not some others, but this is not for other people, this is for more flexibility, and it is better for me.

This has now been solved, thanks to newbiehacker for some help.
At first, I just tried making it read the custom scripts from npc ids, but that wouldnt work, so i tried placing a folder with the npc&#39;s id then the npcs actual name, apparently java doesn&#39;t like packages or classes starting with numbers, in the end, i just thought of a cheap fix,
Only ONE line needs to be changed.
Old:
[/list]deleted[list]
changing this one line will do it. I realize it is a bad way to do it, but since I really don&#39;t know that much, I thought this up but doubted it, but confirmed with newbiehacker that it worked (Working so far) to use this, just find the npc ids of your bosses, add an &quot;i&quot; in front of it, and you are done. For example, if you have a boss named KingBlackDragon, change to i50.
[list][li]Barrows
I finished adding the dialogues and spawning functions completely for the brother tombs, next i have to start scripting each brother, for whatever reason ahrim was already done.

I&#39;m going to do it differently, for one the melee brothers will have a much higher 200 hp each than the usual, and 160 for the karil and ahrim instead of 105.
Today I ended up starting on Torag.
I thought he was too wimpy, so I buffed his attack speed up a nice amount, and since his set effect is REALLY weak, I decided to change it to draining prayer, this also be included in the armor set.
Tomorrow I will do the other 4 brothers that have no attack scripts, then start on the tunnels.
Finished combat scripts on the 31st for all brothers, currently working on the rewards.[/li]

[li]Finish Barrows Minigame[/li]
[/list]
8/1/13
[list]
[li]Rewards chest finished! (Chest isnt ready for players, so killcount etc is not put into account, just testing the possibility of rewards by clicking the chest. The rest can be added very simply later.
[img]http://s18.postimg.org/ka1n81h2v/bchestgif.gif[/img][/li]
[li][b]THIS IS NOT LOADING SOME HIGHER REVISION[/b] but instead I found out that the 474 cache has some primitive HD animations used in around 508+, so I assigned the weapon i was holding those animations via xml[/li]
[li]barrows is done for now, added soul and law runes to the chest, made bolt racks a bit more common, tomorrow im going to change tooth and loop halfs to something else (probably rune) and make dragon med much rarer then start on something else[/li]

[li]Fix conflicting weapon sounds and spell sounds.[/li][/list]
8/4/13
[list]
[li]Got the splash delays correct, spell sounds now work almost 100%, just need to plug in the right ids for the spells. Only combat spells left are normal stat lowering spells such as curse, stun etc and teleblock/charge.[/li]
[li]Stop weapon and spell sounds from conflicting when using spells[/li]
[/list][/list][/ul]

8/7/13

[ul][li]Finally finished magic sounds, special attack sounds, and regular attack sounds now work correctly!
However there may be a few things not included, like 1 or 2 spell sounds because I don&#39;t feel like going on a journey looking for them right now, and over time I&#39;ll add more special attack and regular attack sounds, the mechanics are working, and adding new sounds is easy.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj814jmGJko
After I uploaded the video I realized that the ags special sound was a bit too delayed, lowered the timer on that a bit already.[/li]
[li]Fix npc spawning.... add more npc sounds[/li][/ul]

[li]Finish up secret content for now.. add more sounds as I go...[/li][/ul]


I haven&#39;t [i]not[/i] been working on the server since then at all, but when I have some time I fix or add this and that, and I&#39;ll list everything new since my last update which was almost a year ago..

[li] Finally got around to finishing Hard Difficulty Boss, as in tweaked the attacks, delays, added proper sounds, and added/deleted some behaviors.[/li]

[li] Began drawing up ideas and mechanics for Ultimate difficulty, which is the final boss.[/li]
[li] Added more weapon sounds[/li]
[li] Fixed bonuses to how they should be from their original runescape bonuses.[/li]
[li] Fixed some of the invasion monsters, and added more.[/li]

[li]A while back I made items that gave damage bonuses (EG High level magic staffs), and now I fixed it so they actually WORK, before whichever gave the highest damage bonus would be the only one effecting your max hit, now they stack up, (Example wearing an item that gives 10% magic damage boost, and another that gives 5% boost, they will stack and give you 15% overall)[/li][/ul]


[ul][li]Working on editing item stats for the reward shops rewards, prices, etc[/li][/ul]

7/21/14

[ul][li]Added NPC defense sounds for when they are hit for magic and melee[/li]
