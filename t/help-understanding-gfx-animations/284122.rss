    <title>[Help] Understanding GFX Animations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-understanding-gfx-animations/284122</link>
    <description>Im sorry for asking so many questions but my others arent getting answered anyway :/. What I wanna know is how to make GFX&#39;x like how does RS server or client register that GFX to that item. Anyone have any links to tutorials to those

And off that subject I had an idea of making something like the ape necklace that turned you into a monkey. But I wanna make ifferent ones to turn you into your custom player models. Anyway that can be done/has been done?</description>
