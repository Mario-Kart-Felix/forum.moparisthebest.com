[size=3]Welcome to the Rune2006 Advertisement Thread
Rune2006 is a runescape emulation based on the 2006scape. We have an XP rate of x1. Before you post a link to oldschool runescape, let me assure you, there is still a lot of demand for our server. We hit 30 players online only 1 week after release. There are loads of reasons people would want to play our server even with 2007 runescape around the corner. Before this project I was mainly busy with my previous server. It had been running for the past 2 years and is still online. It had it&#39;s ups and down going from 20 to 150 players online. Noiw however I decided to move on to something new because I felt a lot of newcomers were looking for a pure remake. 
We hope you take a look around. This thread will be updated with more features along the way. 

You may have seen a lot of people using 2006scape lately because a source with 2006scape as base has been released by someone. 
I can however assure you that unlike the other projects, I am dedicated to this.
*My other server has been online for over 2 years and has never had any downtime. 
*We host our services on a ddos protected VPS That can sustain attacks with a high pps rate and bandwith. 
*The released version in the downloads section still had a lot of dupes, which were all fixed with us before their source was even released.
*I am dedicated to developing content and updates and care about my community.

              <p>Soulcist, the thread messed up because links to google got renamed to “google”. To be honest I don’t see what you dislike about the ranks.<br>
Thanks for the feedback though <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Also you are the first to actually find them bad looking. I remember how almost everyone loved them.<br>
Also, what specific ranks do you dislike?</p>

              <p>Thread needs to be cleaned up, should have previewed it before posting this. And the forums are decent but once I hit a thread to view, I saw the ranks - hideous to be honest, and should PROBABLY be changed.</p>
