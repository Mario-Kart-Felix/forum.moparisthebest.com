    <title>Need Secondary 614 Developer</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-secondary-614-developer/535990</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m opening a 614, and I recently had to remove one of our past developers. Both of my current devs are from Australia, so I need someone that I can see on more often. If you can code 614s GOOD, please leave me your skype below. I will give you more info on the server and thing&#39;s of that sort from there. Thanks.

EDIT: I didn&#39;t go very in depth with this, but the server has been online for about 5 months, and runs on a 24/7 VPS. We have an HQ IPboard forums that is NEVER offline, and has never been hacked. We get fairly steady donations, and the server will not be going offline anytime soon. The name is currently Disturbed718, but will of course be changed to disturbed614.</description>
