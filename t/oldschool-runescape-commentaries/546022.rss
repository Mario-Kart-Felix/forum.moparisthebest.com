    <description>Hey everyone, for the past few days I have been experimenting with Camtasia and have decided to start commentating some videos because I&#39;ve been wanting to try it throughout my RS career. Please don&#39;t feel obligated but if you would I&#39;d appreciate some feedback on my content and where I could use some improvement. Check out my channel @ [url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ObaDSECQpL-ZKbBmhehEA/videos]https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ObaDSECQpL-ZKbBmhehEA/videos[/url]

Thanks!</description>
