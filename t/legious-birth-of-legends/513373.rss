[b]Welcome to[i] Legious[/i], a project that will be based upon the 474 graphical era of RuneScape. There will be a lot of unique traits about this new world, while also preserving the core game that you once knew. This will be the birth of a new server and many legendary players.[/b]

[hr]

Almost every project has a development team, mainly because it inspires others to remain dedicated and also gives relief to fellow developers. This not only builds a strong friendship, but speeds up the development process of the server. Fortunately, Legious will also have a development team. If you aren&#39;t quite sure what Legious is all about, visit the development thread [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,631538.0.html]here[/url].
