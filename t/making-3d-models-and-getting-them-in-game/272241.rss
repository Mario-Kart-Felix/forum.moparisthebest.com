    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-3d-models-and-getting-them-in-game/272241</link>
    <description>Hey, did a quick search on the forums, didn&#39;t find anything, 
i can&#39;t make a server for various reasons, so i wanted to try my hand at making E E K (of f2p-pkz.myftp.org) some models and so i want to know the whole process of model making, even the end that i&#39;m not doing, to make it clearer what&#39;s needed.

if anyone could help, it would be awesome.. i have googled this a few times, and all it came up with was guides on making money in rs.. phail</description>
