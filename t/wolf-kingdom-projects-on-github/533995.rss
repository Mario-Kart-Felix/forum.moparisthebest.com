    <title>Wolf-Kingdom projects on GitHub</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wolf-kingdom-projects-on-github/533995</link>
    <description>I have three open source projects on GitHub that I am slowly working on that I would like to share with the community:


In my spare time, I am developing a new MMORPG adventure game based on the DarkQuest RSC private server framework. I like the game mechanics in RSC and wish to implement them with all new game content. I plan to strip out all RSC game content assets over time and replace them with new sprites, new NPCs, new objects, new items, a new landscape continent to explore, an assortment of all new quests to adventure, and a fully interactive player website to go along with it. The game is open source on GitHub and will remain free to play, both in code and eventually in hosting of a server. I will be removing the subscriber features as I do not believe in monetizing this game to turn a profit whatsoever as this is not proprietary to me, the client is still Jagex&#39;s intellectual property, and every community member that has or will contribute to this project should never have their work be exploited for personal monetary gain. If and when I have the money to set up a DDoS shielded game server for the public to play on, I will pay for it out of my own pocket and the administration will be invisible to regular players to allow complete anarchy to reign and plenty of good clan fights to result from player vs player disputes. Experience will be tweaked in several areas to reduce the need to grind and bot but still let players accomplish what they want to keep their interest.

A website has been set up for this project for anyone to check out but a public server will not be available for the foreseeable future. I will run a test server for developers but only whitelisted IPs will be able to connect to it.

[ul][li]This is a PHP website built to run on IIS7+ web server. Pages might not load right with Apache. I need to work more on this to fix it still.[/li]
[li]This includes a main website for the player management interface and a PHPBB forum with a bug tracker mod for players and developers to submit tickets.[/li]
[li]The player management interface works well but needs the password changing function to be added. I would also like to add an online friends list along the right side for logged in game friends.[/li]
[li]The database is shared with the Wolf-Kingdom-Server project and can be found in that project. The database file is named &quot;lupus_regnum.sql&quot;[/li]
[li]Forum administrator account &quot;root&quot; with password set as &quot;password&quot; has been registered on the forum.[/li]
[li]The in-game player created under the &quot;root&quot; username is named &quot;testing&quot; with password &quot;testing&quot;.[/li][/ul]

Sure if you had a GPU farm you'd be able to get all the passwords very fast, but it certainly isn't necessary, especially considering the low amounts of players on these servers.

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I like that approach. The username as a salt would make generating rainbow tables virtually impossible to generate for an entire database but could leave individual users at risk of a custom rainbow table if that was all that was done in theory. I was curious about collisions and found this explanation very enlightening:</p>
<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/4948393" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://stackoverflow.com/a/4948393</a></p>
<blockquote>A note on hashes for passwords:
<p>A key feature of cryptographic hash functions is that they should be very fast to create, and very difficult/slow to reverse (so much so that it’s practically impossible). This poses a problem with passwords. If you store sha512(password), you’re not doing a thing to guard against rainbow tables or brute force attacks. Remember, the hash function was designed for speed. So it’s trivial for an attacker to just run a dictionary through the hash function and test each result.</p>
<p>Adding a salt helps matters since it adds a bit of unknown data to the hash. So instead of finding anything that matches md5(foo), they need to find something that when added to the known salt produces md5(foo.salt) (which is very much harder to do). But it still doesn’t solve the speed problem since if they know the salt it’s just a matter of running the dictionary through.</p>
<p>So, there are ways of dealing with this. One popular method is called key strengthening (or key stretching). Basically, you iterate over a hash many times (thousands usually). This does two things. First, it slows down the runtime of the hashing algorithm significantly. Second, if implemented right (passing the input and salt back in on each iteration) actually increases the entropy (available space) for the output, reducing the chances of collisions. A trivial implementation is:</p>
<p><code>var hash = password + salt;
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5000; i++) {
    hash = sha512(hash + password + salt);
}</code><br>
There are other, more standard implementations such as PBKDF2, BCrypt. But this technique is used by quite a few security related systems (such as PGP, WPA, Apache and OpenSSL).</p>
<p>The bottom line, hash(password) is not good enough. hash(password + salt) is better, but still not good enough… Use a stretched hash mechanism to produce your password hashes…</p>
<p>Another note on trivial stretching</p>
<p>Do not under any circumstances feed the output of one hash directly back into the hash function:</p>
<p><code>hash = sha512(password + salt); 
for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
    hash = sha512(hash); // &lt;-- Do NOT do this!
}</code><br>
The reason for this has to do with collisions. Remember that all hash functions have collisions because the possible output space (the number of possible outputs) is smaller than then input space. To see why, let’s look at what happens. To preface this, let’s make the assumption that there’s a 0.001% chance of collision from sha1() (it’s much lower in reality, but for demonstration purposes).</p>
<p>hash1 = sha1(password + salt);<br>
Now, hash1 has a probability of collision of 0.001%. But when we do the next hash2 = sha1(hash1);, all collisions of hash1 automatically become collisions of hash2. So now, we have hash1’s rate at 0.001%, and the 2nd sha1 call adds to that. So now, hash2 has a probability of collision of 0.002%. That’s twice as many chances! Each iteration will add another 0.001% chance of collision to the result. So, with 1000 iterations, the chance of collision jumped from a trivial 0.001% to 1%. Now, the degradation is linear, and the real probabilities are far smaller, but the effect is the same (an estimation of the chance of a single collision with md5 is about 1/(2^128) or 1/3e38. While that seems small, thanks to the birthday attack it’s not really as small as it seems).</p>
<p>Instead, by re-appending the salt and password each time, you’re re-introducing data back into the hash function. So any collisions of any particular round are no longer collisions of the next round. So:</p>
<p><code>hash = sha512(password + salt);
for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
    hash = sha512(hash + password + salt);
}
</code>Has the same chance of collision as the native sha512 function. Which is what you want. Use that instead…</p>

<p>It’s also summed up nicely in the next post.</p>
<blockquote>bcrypt has a significant advantage over a simply salted SHA-256 hash: bcrypt uses a modified key setup algorithm which is timely quite expensive. This is called key strengthening, and makes a password more secure against brute force attacks, since the attacker now needs a lot more time to test each possible key.</blockquote>

              <p>I have three open source projects on GitHub that I am slowly working on that I would like to share with the community:</p>
<p>In my spare time, I am developing a new MMORPG adventure game based on the DarkQuest RSC private server framework. I like the game mechanics in RSC and wish to implement them with all new game content. I plan to strip out all RSC game content assets over time and replace them with new sprites, new NPCs, new objects, new items, a new landscape continent to explore, an assortment of all new quests to adventure, and a fully interactive player website to go along with it. The game is open source on GitHub and will remain free to play, both in code and eventually in hosting of a server. I will be removing the subscriber features as I do not believe in monetizing this game to turn a profit whatsoever as this is not proprietary to me, the client is still Jagex’s intellectual property, and every community member that has or will contribute to this project should never have their work be exploited for personal monetary gain. If and when I have the money to set up a DDoS shielded game server for the public to play on, I will pay for it out of my own pocket and the administration will be invisible to regular players to allow complete anarchy to reign and plenty of good clan fights to result from player vs player disputes. Experience will be tweaked in several areas to reduce the need to grind and bot but still let players accomplish what they want to keep their interest.</p>
<p>A website has been set up for this project for anyone to check out but a public server will not be available for the foreseeable future. I will run a test server for developers but only whitelisted IPs will be able to connect to it.<br>
