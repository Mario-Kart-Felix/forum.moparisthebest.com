    <title>[508] HD Client - js5io again! [508]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-hd-client-js5io-again-508/260051</link>
    <description>Hey, well for starters, these are what I have done.

1.) Downloaded cache508 + titana cache.
2.) Placed them correctly, and I&#39;ve double-checked them, they are right.
3.) Downloaded my 508 HD IP Changer Client.
4.) Ran an HD Server, which is Rune~Realms v2.
5.) Double-Clicked RUN and it said the Server is started on port:43594
6.) Double-Clicked the RUN in client folder, then I set the IP to 127.0.0.1 and i also tried 0.0.0.0
7.) Updates........ and it doesn&#39;t even get to 80%, it never even starts and I get this horrible message AGAIN!
8.) error_game_js5io
9.) I also checked the Client Files, and by default, it&#39;s at 127.0.0.1 like normal.

What do I do??[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 02, 2009, 02:02:59 pm[/size][hr]Sorry for Double-Posting, but I really need help with this.</description>

              <p>This happens to me and I’ve found no solution yet. Then again what I do is run a server from a cient so yeah.<br>
your server may start on 0.0.0.0 or something that is only playable on your computer.</p>
