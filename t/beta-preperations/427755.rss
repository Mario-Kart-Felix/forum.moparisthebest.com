    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/beta-preperations/427755</link>
    <description>Since it seems we are almost at beta, we really need to work out rates &amp; rules.

Unsure who makes the ultimate decision of the XP rates of the server, and game type (F2P or P2P) but were at the time when it needs to be set in stone.

@MITB: F2P or P2P?

imo going F2P allows room to go P2P later on, but it will cause too much damage the other way around.

@MITB: XP Rates?

I know you, and lots of people want RSC-like rates, imo 1x is just too long, 2x at the minimum, but i personally think 2.5x is the sweet spot.

@MITB: Admins? Mods? or even put someone in charge of making decisions if you don&#39;t want to


@MITB: how many worlds?



During beta, people will just play, i have not seen a beta where people actually report bugs or try to find them, which makes a lot of launches bug riddled.

20x XP rates for a 2 weeks beta, and for each bug found/reported they get some sort of reward when the game goes live (incentive to find bugs and get them fixed for a smooth launch)

also if im missing anything important that needs to be added please post it.</description>

<p>unless people are running it wrong? didn’t seem buggy at all to me, if the sql stuff is still implemented and working then i don’t see any problems. (as i couldn’t test that part due to running a different storage medium)</p>

<p>I agree that mods shouldn’t have any powers that they don’t absolutely need.  I think all of that is taken care of in the configuration already.  There certainly shouldn’t be teleporting of players and such.</p>

The reason why you never see mods on RS is that there are about 1000x more players than we have, and about 150 worlds.</p>

<p>Theres no need for more than 1 World, The community just isnt big enough to spread the player count over more than 1 World, Maybe when you decide to implement 2 Worlds, Implement World 2 as P2P for Subscribers only? This also keeps the server funded for those that want to use the P2P facility.</p>
<p>I would agree on a complete DB of the Beta once its ready to be properly released.</p>

<p>20x XP rates for a 2 weeks beta, and for each bug found/reported they get some sort of reward when the game goes live (incentive to find bugs and get them fixed for a smooth launch)</p>

<p>I agree with all the above, During the beta it will be good to give people an incentive to find and report bugs.</p>
<p>As for XP Rates I would like to see 1x but 2-2.5 is more than reasonable but no higher than 2.5</p>
