[size=14pt][b]Avarrocka is a server like no other server. It is made to entertain.[/b]
Avarrocka will be a server with many features. It will be have perfectly made minigames, skills and bosses as well as a great combat system. This isn’t a rushed project, so keep that in mind. Our team is still working hard on getting each feature to perfection. We’ve set many goals to accomplish in our development. Please support us and prove some feedback about our progress once it will be showed.[/size]

[size=14pt]Avarrocka&#39;s project management is a discipline mainly based on planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. In our case, goals are meant to be respected carefully:[/size]

[ul][li][size=14pt]Deliver great personal gaming experience with lots of customizations.[/size][/li]
[li][size=14pt]Establish a professional organization and maintane it to the end.[/size][/li]
[li][size=14pt]Revise everything with good perspective: each method &amp; field has it&#39;s own potential in the &#39;code&#39;[/size][/li]
[li][size=14pt]Thrive for perfection(visual &amp; non-visual aspects)[/size][/li][/ul]

[size=14pt][i]Once upon a time[/i], when nomadic tribes were scattered across Misthalin, there was one tribe that was ruled by a great warrior named Avar Rocka. Through his travels, he picked up many allies and grew his tribe bigger than any others on the continent. They decided to settle down and become the first, and biggest, city in Misthalin. With Avar Rocka as the leader, and the Council of Avarrocka behind him, they ruled and defended off any attack that came at them. As more cities settled, Avarrocka became the center city of the world, becoming the central hub for politics, economics, trade, and their first known news-paper.

[i]It’s now the 4th age, the name is Varrock[/i], still keeping its’ roots. A monarch has been set up in the land of Varrock, with King Roland III acting as the current king. There has been major attacks on Varrock but nothing that the city couldn’t handle on its’ own. The city is an economic treasure and it’s clearly been defined as the capitol of the world. With that, trouble does lead. Even recently, a discovery at the Varrock Museum finds new notes from the original leader Avar Rocka. They found a note regarding his disappearance, stating he was heading to the “Land of the Creators” and that if he does not return the leader of the Council of Avarrocka would be acting head. More information has been discovered and people are scrambling for the “Land of the Creators”. It’s your job to find out where that is.[/size]

As long as you learned from the last times mistakes there’s no need to be sorry :P. Nah, there was no server sided work being done and all Kieran was doing was constantly taking donations with none of his work put into it so I started getting pissed off and told him to shove his server up his arse. Hopefully this goes far this time <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-i">Once upon a time</span>, when nomadic tribes were scattered across Misthalin, there was one tribe that was ruled by a great warrior named Avar Rocka. Through his travels, he picked up many allies and grew his tribe bigger than any others on the continent. They decided to settle down and become the first, and biggest, city in Misthalin. With Avar Rocka as the leader, and the Council of Avarrocka behind him, they ruled and defended off any attack that came at them. As more cities settled, Avarrocka became the center city of the world, becoming the central hub for politics, economics, trade, and their first known news-paper.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">It’s now the 4th age, the name is Varrock</span>, still keeping its’ roots. A monarch has been set up in the land of Varrock, with King Roland III acting as the current king. There has been major attacks on Varrock but nothing that the city couldn’t handle on its’ own. The city is an economic treasure and it’s clearly been defined as the capitol of the world. With that, trouble does lead. Even recently, a discovery at the Varrock Museum finds new notes from the original leader Avar Rocka. They found a note regarding his disappearance, stating he was heading to the “Land of the Creators” and that if he does not return the leader of the Council of Avarrocka would be acting head. More information has been discovered and people are scrambling for the “Land of the Creators”. It’s your job to find out where that is.[/size]</p>
