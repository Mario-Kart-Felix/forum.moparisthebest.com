    <title>Requesting best base :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/requesting-best-base/549817</link>
    <description>Willing to learn a new base, I used Pi a lot to learn &amp; mess around with but a lot of people saying that it is not stable at all :/ 

I&#39;m looking for a base that has everything core &amp; combat related, so i never touch those again, i&#39;m new, i don&#39;t know at all how to code these :S

Also, I would like a base that loads 602-632 data  I could add this myself but it would be nice if it has it already :P 

Apollo, Hyperion, Runesource (asteria), PI etc? and why should i use thems

Thank you!</description>
