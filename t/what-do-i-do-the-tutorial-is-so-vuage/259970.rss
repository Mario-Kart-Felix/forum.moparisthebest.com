<p>no.</p>
<p>you download a source, which you have.</p>
<p>you have java, so now you need to set your enviroments. (check the tut) and change it to ur java.<br>
this will make your compiler work when you want to update it.</p>
<p>you will need a client or use silab. either is fine atm.</p>
<p>you have to login to ur server by opening your run.bat. you then login with ip 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>when you want to make it live, you will need to make a no-ip for people to login ur server with the ip you make.</p>
<p>you then need to portfoward, or use utorrent. either are fine as they both do the same thing.</p>
<p>you can make a webclient, but you dont need one.</p>
<p>you can use silab for ur server to run on,</p>
<p>you can use a client that you will need to edit to make it fit your server for your server to run on,</p>
<p>or you can make a webclient for your server to run on.</p>
