    <title>Remakes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/remakes/462547</link>
    <description>So, as I was browsing the [i]Server Development[/i] category, I happened to stumble upon many [b]attempted[/b] &#39;06 remakes, and couldn&#39;t help but to wonder as to why so many people love the &#39;06 era that much. Sure, it had old-styled graphics, but that doesn&#39;t make it the [i]best[/i] era, does it? I&#39;m not even sure if there is a successful remake of the &#39;06 era, aside from 2006scape. Anyways, moving on. The threads that I read through seemed as if they were destined to fail. The developer(s) seemed as if they had no clue what they were talking about, so how could they even remotely manage such a project? The remakes that I came upon that lacked potential consists of; but not limited to:

- [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,565258.0.html]2006Reborn[/url]
- [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,564857.0.html]RuneCentre[/url]
- [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,558448.0.html]Project 06[/url]

Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. My intentions are not to bash on the developers, but most of the ones listed above claimed they will be the best, knowing damn well they&#39;re not. (This is all [b]my[/b] opinion) This thread was not intended to be specifically bout 2006 remakes, but remakes in general. I was just curious, why hasn&#39;t anyone tried to remake the 2010 era? I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s because of the farming and construction skill(s), correct me if i&#39;m wrong. Moving on. 2010 was a decent year for me while playing RuneScape, and the graphics were still &#39;older-styled&#39;.

So, I just want everyone&#39;s opinion on remakes. Also, please excuse me if I was rambling. :)</description>

              <p>I agree. Just from looking at the effort that some of these people put in their project threads, I can tell that they will fail. But there are some remakes, where I can tell that the developers are dedicated. Like 2006Scape and F2P2006 (F2P2006 is the best and the only F2P remake in development)</p>

              <p>My sincerest apologies. I began playing RuneScape back in 2006-2007, but quit up until 2010. When I quit, I don’t believe they had released the farming skill yet (Or I didn’t think it was, although I had not the slightest clue on how to play the game), so I was just assuming it was added in '10, which was completely idiotic of me. Even though the '06 era is the most documented doesn’t make it impossible to create a successful remake of 2010. I’m just tired of seeing remakes of the exact same era, not to mention, they all turn out the same. The developers always run into complications and end up giving in and stopping the project all together, which is completely stupid. I mean, don’t get me wrong, there are decent remakes out there, such as <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,513804.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener"> F2P2006 RS remake</a> and <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,543137.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">RuneRebels.</a></p>
<p>It’s not so much the year that’s bothering me, it’s the remake itself. If someone is going to attempt such a daunting task, they should know it takes time, knowledge, and patience to complete such a project. Do you all get where i’m coming from? I just wish people would try harder, that’s all.</p>
