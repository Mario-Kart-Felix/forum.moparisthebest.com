[center]This is a big project, so I need professional coders who knows what they are doing. We have vps running with 30 Gb and it’s very smooth to use. At the moment the project is nowhere because our first objective is to find a reliable and good source to use because if we started from scratch it would take a month or two to finish. You won’t be sorry starting this project! Jut imagine players saying good job to us, for what we done. It would be tremendous feeling.[/center]</p>
