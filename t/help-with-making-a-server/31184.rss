    <description>I need help on making the server but I know a little but I need help opening client.java.

Im following a tutorial on this website: http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,40730.0.html

On step 5 I dont get how to do it. Like finding the client.java.. some1 said that it could be anything and in a wordpad icon. But in the tutorial it said find moderators but I coulndt find it.

so here it is:

&quot;Now you need to make yourself an admin. So open up client.java and hit control+f. Search for moderaters. You should get a thing that says start of moderator/admin list. If you don&#39;t, keep searching untill you do.
When you find it, add this code on the line below.

Code:
if (playerName.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;YOURNAME&quot;))
				{
					playerRights = 3; 
				}

Step 6:
Now save and exit. Double click compile.bat. Open up moparscape and make sure your server ip is 127.0.0.1 Login with the name that you put in the previous code. Say anything that you want. If a gold crown appears next to your name, Good for you. If it doesn&#39;t then go into client.java and search for 

Code:
if(playerId == -1) out.write(7);
You should see this--

Code:
			if(playerId == -1) out.write(7);		// &quot;This world is full.&quot;
			else out.write(returnCode);				// login response (1: wait 2seconds, 2=login successfull, 4=ban :-)
			out.write(playerRights);		// mod level
			out.write(0);					// no log

replace that  with 

Code:
			if (playerId == -1) out.write(7);		// &quot;This world is full.&quot;
			else out.write(returnCode);				// login response (1: wait 2seconds, 2=login successfull, 4=ban :-)
			if (playerRights == 3)
			{
				out.write(2);      //Crown fixup
			}
			else
			{
				out.write(playerRights);		// mod level
			}

			out.write(0);					// no log

		}&quot;</description>
