    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-you-please-help-me-with-range/163844</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;How come when i use a magic shortbow and rune arrows, it will hit damage on players, but when i attack npcs, ill just face the npc but not do anything(shoot arrows or hit damage)???

can someone please tell me what i should do?
thanks!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
ok i figured out the problem.. i wont hit damage on the npc unless, im right up to his face (touching him)

how do i make it so that i dont have to be touching him to hit damage on him with range?</description>
