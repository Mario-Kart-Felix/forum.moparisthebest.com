    <description>Hello, I&#39;m currently developing a 317 server and I&#39;m in need of some help. I need people who are well rounded(programming,moderating players,graphics) you&#39;ll be given administrative privileges to the server and site. I will be hosting the server off a poweredge 2650 once we get more players. I&#39;m hoping to have a release within the next week or 2.

Pm me if your interested!

Thank you!

*We&#39;re also looking for quality video editors!</description>

It seems that you are global troll, you ansver to all topics even thought you don’t have any idea to most of them. For example how is it really needed how many years of coding and what languages and what projects you have done and so on? If person is skilled I would take him in, even if he has been in 1 project or only private projects. And since this person did NOT use such a stupid template he is smart. Btw good luck with finding ppl, how skilled you want them to be?</p>

I need people who are well rounded(programming,moderating players,graphics) you’ll be given administrative privileges to the server and site. I will be hosting the server off a poweredge 2650 once we get more players. I’m hoping to have a release within the next week or 2.</p>
