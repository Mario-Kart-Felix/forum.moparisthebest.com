    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-read-posting-tips-tricks-more/543620</link>
    <description>Hello guys, I&#39;m sure a lot of you in this section have met me, or at least dealt with me. I&#39;ve tried this before, and didn&#39;t get much community support. Well, here&#39;s another shot.

The purpose of this post is to try and guide you into posting more informative topics in Server Help. Why is that important? It&#39;ll get you the help you need/want in a faster amount of time.
[anchor=Top]
Quick links to each section or tip:

[b][anchor=tldr]TL;DR - The irony is this is before the wall of text[/b]
     Some members have stated that a wall of text can look menacing, and that a lot of people would skip it. I&#39;ve decided to try and sum up all the sections (besides the google one, and the link one) into this one brief summary. If you don&#39;t like how it&#39;s explained, read the full section.

     [u]Posting[/u] - This one is hard to &quot;TL;DR&quot; because of how specific it can get sometimes. Basically, it&#39;s no biggie if you post into the incorrect section. We won&#39;t get mad, but you&#39;ll probably get a member or two telling you where it belongs, and it might get moved by a moderator. Again, nothing bad. If you have an error in your server console, it&#39;s probably server sided. If you have an error in your client console (or it freezes), it&#39;s more than likely client sided. NPC&#39;s, Items, Objects, and Maps are all done client sided in most 317s, and therefore you should post there. If you have any questions on this, read the more detailed version (it&#39;s worth it).

     [u]Revision[/u] - The importance of telling us the revision of your server is to essentially help us know the packet and code structure of your server. This is based on each time RuneScape made an update to the game.

     [u]Server Base[/u] - This is one of the most crucial pieces of information because there are millions of servers released on so many bases, knowing what base will provide us with a starting point to get you the proper code you need. Usually the person that released it will have the base in the release, but don&#39;t always. If they don&#39;t, I&#39;d compare some code in it to code released on sites (like this one) for tutorials and such.

     [u]Informative Titles[/u] - Think of Server Help as a candy shop. If your topic has a good title, it would taste better to the helper, and therefore they will be more inclined to test it (a.k.a read your topic). Thus increasing your chance at having your problem solved. A great title format would be: [Revision Number] Server Base - Simple description of error.
Example:
[317] PI - Cannot combine Sara brews when using them on each other

      [u]Multiple Topics[/u] - It&#39;s highly recommended that you do not post multiple topics for each one of your errors or issues. Please remember that it&#39;s against the rules to post multiple topics that are duplicates or near duplicates. Instead, List each of your problems in one topic, and pick the most important one to you as the thread title.

I hope this TL;DR sums it up nicely, please leave questions pertaining any section (read the actual section first pl0x) of this post below.

[b][anchor=post]Posting - Am I in the correct board?[/b]
      I think this part is the hardest for new comers to understand. Sometimes I can even get confused because the newer revisions have cache data and other &quot;client related stuff&quot; server sided (I&#39;m using the term client related stuff loosely here). Sometimes you could even be 100% certain it&#39;s a server sided issue, but it ends up being client sided. Do not worry! We do not infract you for posting in the wrong section here (assuming you didn&#39;t just purposely post some garbage in the wrong section, it&#39;s rather easy to tell at times). While I cannot guarantee you&#39;ll find the correct section based off this guide, I can only hope it helps.

      [u]Server Help[/u] - You&#39;ll most likely be here because:

[ul][li]You got an error while compiling your server[/li]
[li]You got an error while running your server[/li]
[li]Your IDE is showing an error you do not understand, and it&#39;s in your server[/li]
[li]Something in your server isn&#39;t working as you wanted[/li]
[li]Stats for an item are incorrect[/li]
[li]You didn&#39;t even know about the client help section[/li][/ul]

Please note: Newer revisions above 317 usually have the cache server sided and it&#39;s sent through jaggrab or similar. In that case, cache issues can be considered server-sided and not client.
     [u]Client Help[/ul]

[ul][li]An item is invisible[/li]
[li]An item isn&#39;t positioned correctly in your inventory[/li]
[li]Sprites don&#39;t look right/are missing[/li]
[li]Basically anything related to creating/editing/moving/changing an interface[/li]
[li]Animations are missing or are screwy[/li]
[li]The client won&#39;t load[/li]
[li]ANYTHING webclient related.[/li][/ul]


[b]Hey moparscapers, I want some help with this section. I want you all to help me find core items that can identify whether or not it belongs in client or server help.[/b]

[iurl=#Top]Back to top[/iurl]
[hr]

[b][anchor=Revision]Revision - What&#39;s so important about it?[/b]
     To start, I&#39;ll explain where we get the revision from. The revision number comes from RuneScape, each time they make an update the revision number is changed. Usually it&#39;s just up by one, but I believe it depends on how they&#39;re feeling lol. While I don&#39;t know the exact reason why we care to know it, I&#39;ll explain why I ask for it. I ask because it helps in finding the packet structure and all that good stuff. I personally try to use the [url=https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/]RSWiki[/url] as much as possible before asking packet based questions.

[iurl=#Top]Back to top[/iurl]
[hr]

[b][anchor=Base]Server Base - Don&#39;t say the wrong one[/b]
     This is a lot more important than telling us your revision. Why? Because you can modify client data to make it look like a newer revision, and a lot of people base their servers revision off of that and that alone. When I say &quot;Don&#39;t say the wrong one&quot; I mean to say the [u]actual base[/u] of your server. There are thousands (dare I say millions) of servers out there. That doesn&#39;t mean the server&#39;s base you downloaded, &quot;LeechScape v101.2 by CrappyDev&quot;, is &quot;LeechScape&quot;. The base is a tad bit harder to get than that (Unless it was a framework). Usually they&#39;ll include the base in the title, along with the surname they decided to give it. So instead of it being, &quot;LeechScape v101.2 by CrappyDev&quot;, it&#39;s, &quot;[Project Insanity] LeechScape v101.2 by CrappyDev&quot;, or even, &quot;[Delta] LeechScape v101.2 by CrappyDev&quot;. That would make the server&#39;s base Project Insanity, or delta (respectively). Meaning when you reference the base, call it a PI (Project insanity) or Delta. [u]Knowing the base will help us 100% in helping you because we will have a great understanding of the coding structure used, packets, and all that general stuff. It is one of the most important pieces of information you could give us, besides your issue and your code.[/u]
[u]What if it doesn&#39;t say the base?[/u] - Great question. There are a few reasons why it may not, including (but not limited to): The dev forgot to say, the dev won&#39;t say, it&#39;s in the post and not the title, it&#39;s a framework (basically a base), or you&#39;re not looking hard enough. To find the base you&#39;ll have to look in the code (or replies on the thread, lol). I cannot give you examples of all coding structures in every base ever made, but I&#39;ll give you a couple from Delta (from memory) and PI, since I used them as examples.
Delta:
[code=java]
sM(&quot;This is a send message in delta!&quot;);
[/code]

Project Insanity:
[code=java]
c.sendMessage(&quot;This is a send message in PI!&quot;);
[/code]

While those are super basic examples (and method names can be changed super easily), there are a few minor differences. (Remember that I haven&#39;t touched a delta base since Bluur&#39;s client was popular) In the PI, you have the client object before the sendMessage, unlike delta. However, if you&#39;re in the client class of PI you wouldn&#39;t either.
Anyone reading, if you have a better example feel free to post it.

[b][anchor=Titles]Titles - Get your help faster[/b]
     The first thing a potential helper sees about your post is the title. If your title doesn&#39;t give much information, some people won&#39;t even bother to even click your post. I know when I first started being a major contributor to this section, my first &quot;round&quot; in the posts was me clicking topics that had the base in the title because I knew how to help with those ones the most. Only after that would I go look at the others, and maybe not even then.
Put yourself in my shoes, if you can, and go into this section. Look at the topic titles. (At the time of posting) Here is what I see:
[img width=700]http://puu.sh/9cB34/9c3856c6dd.png[/img]
[url=http://puu.sh/9cB34/9c3856c6dd.png]Click me for full size[/url]
While it might be ironic that the topic named &quot;LOOK AT THIS&quot; has nearly the most posts in the picture, that&#39;s not the point here. The one topic I replied to (at the time, I started this post soon after) is titled &quot;How to find custom item ids? 317&quot;. What&#39;s so good about this topic that I went to it first? His title. It tells me exactly what he needs help with, and his revision. While I would rather him have put the base there, the revision helps.
Now lets get back to mr. LOOK AT THIS. The all caps suggests he is either frustrated or annoyed (these are the 2 emotions I usually get off the people posting all caps titles I&#39;ve worked with in the past). Do you really think I want to work with some random person on the internet that is irritated? No. They make my &#39;job&#39; difficult. When you&#39;re upset, you aren&#39;t level headed and you most likely aren&#39;t thinking clearly. So when we ask you to do something, try something, or post something. It can end up with you just getting more upset at us, and no one needs that. Do not post if you&#39;re upset. Take a breather first. Seriously, you might even find that you knew the answer before you post because you weren&#39;t thinking straight earlier.
[u]What do you require in a title[/u] - While not an official requirement here at moparscape. I&#39;d like to see a title in this format:
[Revision] Base - Issue
Examples:
[317] PI - Cannot cut any trees with hatchet
[718] Matrix - Cannot give myself admin rank
[317] Delta - Packet 126 isn&#39;t working, no interface text updates when I use it.

[b][anchor=MultiTopics]Multiple topics - They won&#39;t get you faster help[/b]
     If you looked in the picture above ([url=http://puu.sh/9cB34/9c3856c6dd.png]Link[/url]) you would have noticed some users have made more than one topic. Depending on the contents of said topics, it could or could not be against the rules. Moparscape doesn&#39;t allow you to post multiple topics trying to accomplish the same thing. However, you can post as many (as long as they aren&#39;t spam) as you want if they&#39;re about different stuff. But in Server Help, that may not be a good idea. If you list your issues into one post, that will not diversify your viewers into other topics of yours. Meaning instead of having one topic with 11 views, another with 40, and then a third with 500, you could have one giant topic with all 500 views (because it might be the same people reading the other topics and whatnot). That would give you a higher chance of all your issues being solved. Here is an example on how I&#39;d make a topic with multiple issues.
[spoiler=Example](Title) [317] PI - 5 issues. Issue One: Cannot enter altars if wearing a tiara.
(Body)
Hello faithful members of Server Help. I have a lot of issues today. And I thank you all for taking the time to read my topic.
The first issue is most important to me, so I&#39;d like it if you helped me with that first.
[b]1. Cannot enter altars if wearing a tiara.[/b]
Whenever I am wearing a tiara, and try to click the mysterious ruins (object 12345), it will not let me in. But if I do the same thing with a talisman in my inventory, it works.
Here is my code:
ActionHandler (For clicking the object)
[code=java]
case 12345:
     c.getRunecrafting().enterAltar();
     break;
[/code]
RuneCrafting.java (for the enterAltar method)
[code=java]
public void enterAltar() {
     if(c.getItems().playerHasItem(4444)) {
          c.getPA().movePlayer(1, 2, 0);
     }
}[/code]
[b]2.Other issue[/b]
Other data about issue
(Topic End)
And so forth. It still gives you the informative title, and you still have all your questions, there&#39;s just less link surfing to get to them.

[b][anchor=goog]Googling - Getting useful search results[/b]
     You should always google your issue before you come here, so here&#39;s some tips to help you get some better results.
Google loves key terms. Never enter a sentence. You&#39;ll get obscured results that way.
Example:
How do I add new attack animations to a project insanity RuneScape Private Server? - My question
Project Insanity Adding Attack Animations - Same question, less words.

Google also has lots of search features. I&#39;m not going to highlight all of them, but here&#39;s some I use:
&quot;word or phrase&quot; - If you quote a word or phrase, google will make sure the page contains those exact words (should be in that order as well)
site:http://moparisthebest.com/smf - You can add this to search one site and one site alone.
filetype:zip - Searching for specific file types.
-Term - Excluding a search term. Good for filtering.

[iurl=#Top]Back to top[/iurl]
[hr]

[b][anchor=links]Useful links[/b]
http://google.com - For everything, literally.
https://rswiki.moparisthebest.com/ - The RSWiki, useful for packet data and all the fun jazz.
-links to come- I will not put other sites like Rune-Serv here because they&#39;re technically this websites competition.

This topic is to be expanded, edited, and such. Please ask any questions regarding tips on how to post here. This is not a topic for you to reply with your server related questions, so do not treat it as such.
