              <p>so luke couldnt ddos RSCU, a server which was frequently down due to DDOS during its glory days of 25-30 players on concurrently (dont try to deny it, I played on the server actively during those times), BUT he is somehow to blame for all of the other DDOS attacks. And who is this mystery attacker that has more power than luke? Why dont you hate on him, he’s got a more powerful botnet and he’s DDOSing someone other than Luke. surely he isnt your friend if hes ddosing a competitor of RSCE</p>
<p>If you hate him just go ahead and do it, but if he’s here trying to put up a server where we can all pk, stake, and just play the god damn game, who cares what he did or did not DDOS…? Last time I checked this forum was not a reality check, a judgement of character, or a place of high morals. We’re here to play runescape, go cry about misleading topic titles somewhere else</p>

<p>I have been through more attacks and much larger attacks than any other RSC private server owner and I’m still online.

It’s all too easy to just close up and blame it on someone else.</p>

So why isn’t it online? God forbid, did a server fail without me apparently attacking it?</p>
<p>As I keep saying… Post evidence or be quiet.</p>
<p>Servers failing is because of poor administration. KO9 tackled the problems just fine before getting bored and giving up AFTER all the problems were solved. xEnt’s BeyondRSC arguably died due to attacks but it was behind the same protection that RSCE was (which stayed online). The difference was, the software itself couldn’t handle it (not the network) and it died due to a lot of downtime. DarkQuest was ridded due to DDoS too but he had the choice of taking RSCA’s actual server which was proven to cope with DDoS attacks fine but Peeter decided against it (bad decision and poor administration). Peeter didn’t purchase any SecurePort DDoS protection so it was constantly offline at network level. RSCAftermath/RSCDevil failing wasn’t related to DDoS but instead a simple exploit that they didn’t have the knowledge to fix and in the end it collapsed.</p>
<p>I can’t think of any other server worth mentioning really…[/quote]Make me quiet.<br>
DDOS me, see where that ends up.</p>

<p>no one is mature enough these days to make a server successful anyway they give up after afew ddos, if you havnt got enough money to buy a good host whats the point?<br>

Ideas are bigger than money.[/quote]</p>
<p>no because if it isnt kryptix someone eles will find it funny to exploit the server, fact.</p>
