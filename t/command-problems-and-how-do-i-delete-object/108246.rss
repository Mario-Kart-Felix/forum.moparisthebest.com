    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/command-problems-and-how-do-i-delete-object/108246</link>
    <description>well the title basically says it :|
in client.java it has all the stuff for ::bank...but when in game i type ::bank nothing happens :(
please help cos this happens with all other commands 
it compiles just fine, but the ingame just does not do nothing when i type ::bank :(
here is the code::
&lt;blockquote&gt;else if (command.startsWith(&quot;bank&quot;)) {
				openUpBank();
			}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
