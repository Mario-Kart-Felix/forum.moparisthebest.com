Hey everyone, I&#39;m sure most of you have heard of unity3D or even used it.. It&#39;s a great game-making engine and I&#39;m currently undergoing a small project of my own.. 

I will update my progress here everytime I make a new video.. here are the first 3 days of my development; Please support my project by subscribing to my Youtube channel :D

[b]Day 1:[/b]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpiCPTijiGw

[b]Day 2:[/b]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=revLqlgWISg

[b]Day 3:[/b]
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHtRfCN3CQY

NOW I STOPPED WORKING ON IT FOR A LIKE A BIT DUE TO THE SCALE OF THE WORLD, WHICH CAUSED LACK OF IDEAS AND MODELS.. I FOUND IT MUCH EASIER IF I JUST DO A SMALL AREA, AND BUILD OF THAT... SO I STARTED TO REDO EVERYTHING TODAY, AND THIS IS WHAT 4 HOURS HAS GOT ME. ENJOY GUYS...
[youtube]http://youtu.be/6MQQvMasnwo[/youtube]

[b]November 14th - I finally got some motivation together and pretty much finished the starting zone &quot;the forgotten island&quot;.. Yes, there is still some sound effects to add... and a few colliders that need to be fixed, but all that can be done in a a small amount of time, so they are not worrying me. But here is where I am at the moment, please leave criticism on what you think of it... Thanks, and I hope you enjoy the video... - On a side note, I will start working on the next zone (area in the last bit of this video) in probably a week, so yeah don&#39;t expect anything large in the next few days to come!

I’ve only done minimal scripting so far in this scene, and it’s the last thing on my mind to be honest… I really just want to finish the terrain first <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Though the movement animations were all scripted <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

              <p>I love Unity and have been using it for years! I wish you the best of luck! I had decided that Unity was the best choice for making an RPG, but only one person had made tutorials for it. He had coded it in C# and has hundreds of tutorials and assets needed.</p>
<p>Will you make tutorials and/or release any of your work? Are you coding it in Javascript, C#, or Boo? What are you using for modeling, for texturing, and for everything else?</p>
