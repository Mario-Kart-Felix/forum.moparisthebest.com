    <title>718 iP address problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/718-ip-address-problem/537565</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve changed the ip from 127.0.0.1 to my new ip address, and i saved, compiled and when I ran it on my computer, the source says &quot;User logged in from *new ip address*&quot; So it says I did it right, but when i give a copy of the client to my buddy, the client crashes and says &quot;jr5connect&quot; in the cmd. So it&#39;s telling me its logging in from the new ip, but its still running localhost from his apparently? :palm: Any help would be appreciated. Using a 718, &quot;extremeKO&quot; is the source, client is an editted Matrix</description>

              <p>That’s what i’m trying to test. My buddy is testing it for me, and the client isn’t working for him, cause apparently it is running from localhost (127.0.0.1) instead of the new iP</p>
