              <p>Well it depends what you have available, I have a PC dedicated to hosting in another room, I run Linux only on it. Then I have a laptop for actually browsing etc (Which also uses Linux). I’ve successfully hosted a site in the past over a long period of time. It also depends on what skills you have available, I ran into a ton of problems over a stretched period of time.</p>
<p>If you can’t get used to fixing your own things and have experience and patience then I doubt you’d get far. I prefer using my PC because it is a lot more comfortable knowing I have complete control, it’s also easier for me and appears to run a lot faster for other people. I simply don’t have the money to dish out on premium hosting. If you intend to host over a long period of time and truly wanted to go far don’t go with Windows.</p>
<p>You would only need to look into premium hosting (Which would cost) if your site became <span class="bbcode-b">very</span> big. As for me, I’m more than happy with my home hosting. You could just look for upgrades to your current computer but I think under that circumstance you may be better of just going premium for the sake of time and money.</p>

              <p>I didn’t say it was the best approach. Personally I would get a cheap 512mb RAM VPS for hosting an average website. That way I can install Lighttpd or Cherokee. I don’t need all the features that Apache offers. But a lot of people use Nginx for serving static content and Apache for server-side scripting. That seems to be a pretty efficient approach.</p>

<p>You can get decent website hosting for under $5 a month. Unless you can guarantee the server load on your computer, plus the uptime I would just go for paid hosting.

Well, I guess I’ll host it on my PC. I’ve really got enough of having a limit like 1 mysql database, just 1 gb files, 10 gb bandwidth etc. And support people saying: "For more crap, just buy paid hosting! Just for 40$ a month blah blah remember you can only pay for 5 years, not monthly blah blah.</p>
