Well It&#39;s a game brought to you by level 5 studios and, wait for  it, Studio Ghibli!
It&#39;s coming out within the coming days here in the states, your thoughts about it or have you even heard of it?

One, of the many, features I like about it is that a lot of the cut scenes were animated by Studio Ghibli in the same hand drawn fashion as most of their widely recognized feature films ([i]Porco Rosso, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki&#39;s delivery service, Howl&#39;s Moving Castle, Nausica of The Valley of The Wind, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke[/i], etc.)</description>
