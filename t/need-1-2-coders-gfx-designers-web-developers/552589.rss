    <title>Need 1-2 coders, gfx designers, Web developers</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-1-2-coders-gfx-designers-web-developers/552589</link>
    <description>Ok, so let me explain my intentions here for anyone who cares to read this.

My Web base is based off of older 317 sever called epicurus.

I&#39;ve been around a while my self owned my own server before. I plan on making this a very successful sever I will pay people for their services and time if they want that, if they want to for fun that&#39;s fine to. I can gaurentee with the ideas and time I have put into rsps I know what people want. Again I will cover all expenses for VPS and if I absolutely have to I&#39;ll pay for services. But just hit me up on Skype if interested.

Edit &gt; I now have 1 server sided coder, looking for a client sided developer, and I can do the website myself but I needed help with some things So iwas looking for someone that was better then myself at Web development.

Skype: stenen.clark73

Thanks for your time</description>
