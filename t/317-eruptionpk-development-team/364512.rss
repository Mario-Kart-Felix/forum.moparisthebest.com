    <description>[center][b]Hello. This server is going to use Project Insanity. I need a dedicated team to do their job and be dedicated to this team.
I have made a team before but half of my friend&#39;s were in UK,Europe, etc. So try to be near USA or in USA time zone so we can be on at the same time and do work on the server.
Once you give me your MSN I will add you and we can get started and alsp I&#39;m working on it atm.
Help me fill up the spots so we can get started!
Application:

Position:
Experience:
Time Zone:
Time you will spend on server (dedication):
Why would you like to join:
MSN:


Staff List:
Coder/Hoster: ME
Coder: Open
Coder: Open
Client Coder: Open
GFX: Open
mySQL/PHP Coder: Open

Roles of Positions:
Coder: We will code server sided along with me to make our source better.
Client Coder: You will code the models, Client name, etc.
GFX: You will make design&#39;s of the server such as banner&#39;s, pictures of the server, etc.
mySQL/PHP Coder: You will help design the highscores and the forums.

MSN is my main way on contacting you so make sure you have MSN and also if you have skype that might help a bit.
I can also email you when you need to me email you things that need to get done so our team know&#39;s what needs to be done.



I will buy a VPS once we get our server on a toplist and gets decent amount of votes, and we will add thing&#39;s like Perfect Combat, Pk Point System + Anti Farm, Nice Organized Donator system, minigames, and more!
 Also this server won&#39;t fail because, the more dedicated staff, the more the server will be better![/b][/center]</description>
