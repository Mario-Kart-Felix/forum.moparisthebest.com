    <title>PSP Version (signed) Lamecraft</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/psp-version-signed-lamecraft/394671</link>
    <description>Found this last year before it was ever released, I just recently caught back up with the project, and figured some of you may want to take a look at it. Sure, it has major limitations due to the PSP&#39;s lack of ram, and the programmers lack of caching/uncaching knowledge (seems like something he needs to learn for the sake of bigger maps). He probably knows of it, but needs to know how. Anyways, for any information:

I have it on my PSP atm, and so far, it looks nice. This is also like the classic version of Minecraft, no punching blocks until it is destroyed. Just instant destroy/placement. I think the dev could do some more impressive things since he has gotten this far, than to create a MC clone. Oh well, have fun whoever uses it!

EDIT: Had the question over that the &#39;signed&#39; means. It means you can run this without HBL (half byte loader), or any exploit/hack on your psp. I currently have a hacked PSP, so I forgot to mention that.</description>
