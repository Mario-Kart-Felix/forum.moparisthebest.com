    <title>New to all of this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-to-all-of-this/538191</link>
    <description>Hello, I came here because I wanted to use the original MoparScape client, however the version on the main site gives me automatic lvl 99 in all skills and I can&#39;t save my progress. I would like to use the original MoparScape map and set up a server where I can start all skills at level one and build everything up over time to 99 as well as save my progress. I&#39;m almost certain this has been asked before, so if someone else already has a (active) server like this, could someone please post a link to it, or even a server that doesn&#39;t deviate too much from the original version of the game.

I remember trying to find a server like this several months ago, but most of the time, the servers that I tried to log on to were inactive, and the servers that I could get into were so profoundly different from the game I wanted that I wasn&#39;t interested in them.

I am only a casual player. I have no experience in programming, but I&#39;m almost positive that a simple tutorial can help me to design a server with the game I want without too much trouble. In fact, designing such a server would probably help me to start learning how to make changes and make the game better, design new quests, and learn about programming. Any help is appreciated.</description>

<p>Also, I found a starter tutorial for Java on YouTube and downloaded Eclipse onto my computer.

<p>Depends. This is the same thing I thought 4 years ago when I joined and here I am with still a lot more to learn. Tutorials will only take you so far.</p>
<p>If you need any additional help pm me.</p>
