    <description>Sung to the tune of In the Air tonight
[u]In the Post Tonight-Sanga282(Ancient)[/u]
I can feel it coming in the post tonight, Oh Nintendo
I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment, all this week, Oh Nintendo
Can you feel it coming in the Post tonight, Oh Nintendo, Oh Nintendo

Well, if you told me you were dyeing
I would not lend a hand
I&#39;d be playing my Wii my friend
But I don&#39;t know my Wii very well
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw swipe my Wii before my eyes
So you can wipe off the grin, I know where my Wii&#39;s been
It&#39;s all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the post tonight, Oh Ninteo
I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment for all this week, Oh Nintendo
I can feel it in the post tonight, Oh Nintendo, Oh Nintendo
And I&#39;ve been waiting for this moment all this week, Oh Nintendo, Oh Nintendo

Well I remember, my Wii so don&#39;t worry
How could I ever forget, it&#39;s the first time, me and it ever met
But I know the reason why my Wii is the best, it doesn&#39;t fool me
The hurt doesn&#39;t show; but the RROD still glows
It&#39;s no stranger,that 360, to me

And I can feel it coming in the post tonight, Oh Nintendo...</description>
