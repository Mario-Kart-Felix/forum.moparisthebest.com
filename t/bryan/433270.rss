    <description>Stumbled upon a chest with 3x64 diamond blocks now I&#39;m not being funny but obvious xray is obvious? This has completely ruined the confined resources there is on this world now because someones xrayed all the diamonds and locked them in a chest which he&#39;s stumbled upon (that&#39;s the story anyway).

I think they should be removed to be honest, that&#39;s like every diamond in W2. He has 2x64 diamond blocks, 3x64 iron blocks and has developed an attitude because of it. 

Also, serious problem, ban command only works if the player is online. Haven&#39;t been able to punish any of the recent players who grief.</description>

              <p>Coonhunter became inactive, not sure if he removed them. There seems to be a lot of suspect duping/cheating going on here we need means to check what items people have to be honest.</p>

              <p>Hmm.<br>
I got a msg from Manbearpig saying that Girlmans chests that were stuck in my hallway were finally unlocked. and he gave me a block of diamond and gold and a few wool.<br>
Were these the chests that were unlocked? Cause I could see that player doing that as they were banned for cheating.</p>
<p>But I don’t think that counts as all the ore in the world. I myself have 2.5 blocks of iron and 50 odd blocks of diamond. But I also use stone tools for everything and have dung some big holes.</p>
<p>Hard to say. found materials are just that even if they were originally acquired illegally. The Player that did cheat is banned, I dont think the player that haven’t cheated should be held responsible.</p>

              <p>He now had a sudden change of mood and has burnt the blocks. Though this isn’t over, he still refuses to tell us other people who plundered the duped/xrayed blocks from a supposedly banned persons chests.</p>
<p>I also suggest Moparisthebest checks Bryans chests, he has unreasonable amounts of items/wealth as far as I’m being told. I also suspect he hasn’t burnt all the blocks and is lieing to me.</p>

<p>As for the ban command that has been a problem for a long time now, you can use a cracked client to log in with the name then ban it.</p>
