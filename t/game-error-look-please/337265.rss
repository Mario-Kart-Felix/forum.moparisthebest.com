    <title>Game error[LOOK PLEASE!]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/game-error-look-please/337265</link>
    <description>Well the client works for all of my other friends, but with my other friend he is having problems. He says he can play the game for about 10 seconds and then gets kicked off and it says there is an error.
How can he fix this?</description>

              <p>this is probably not the client since it works for all your other friends. it could be your server booting him for diferent reasons (check your run.bat when he gets kciked) or maybe hes been banned or something (get him to log in from a dif acc)</p>
