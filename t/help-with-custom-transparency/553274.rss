    <title>Help with Custom (Transparency?)</title>

    <description>Hey im trying to add a Tensa Zangetsu sword to my 317 PI server.. The sword is displaying weird.. i got it added to the cache and the server sided portion of it done.. but when i equip the item most of it is transparent.. (the sword is red and black, red spots on the handle) and it only shows the red spots and not the rest of the sword which is black.. what could be causing this, i didnt have the ints for this when i got the model.. so is there set ints for each and every model?? and if so is there a way to get those ints with just the model??

i realize this is probably a really nooby question im new to adding customs.. what could be causing the sword to be transparent like that? and do i have to have specific ints for every custom? or can i use like a template that would work with most models?

thanks.

EDIT: (It would probably help if you guys had the code... sorry wasnt thinking lol)

[code]		case 15435:
itemDef.name = &quot;Tensa Zangetsu&quot;;
itemDef.itemActions = new String[5];
itemDef.itemActions[1] = &quot;Wear&quot;;
itemDef.itemActions[2]=&quot;Drop&quot;;
itemDef.modelid = 1016;
itemDef.modelZoom = 450;
itemDef.modelRotationY = 267;
itemDef.modelRotationX = 138;
itemDef.modelOffset1 = 4;
itemDef.modelOffset2 = 3;
itemDef.anInt165 = 1016; //-1
itemDef.anInt200 = 1016; //-1
itemDef.description = &quot;Bankai!&quot;;
break;

              <p>Afaik the Tensa Sangetsu is a mostly black sword right?</p>
<p>Fury is probably right here. The black color is probably being disabled.</p>
<p>Here’s why it was:<br>
When people added 602/634+ items into their client,  random black triangles would appear. Most people are pretty sure this is due to read values…<br>
But the cheaphack solution was to just make the black triangles transparent.<br>
WELP, they didn’t think about the fact that a bunch of items actually <span class="bbcode-i">use</span> that color…<br>
For example: Black Partyhat (Custom), Black Dragonhide (the body,legs), Santa’s feet (the NPC santa), player’s feet (When set to a certain black), The entire skeleton outfit.</p>
<p>There are 2 solutions to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the code that makes the black triangles transparent. This can usually be done by searching “// black tri” in Models<br>
You’ll find something close to:<br>
|| anIntArray1640[i2] == 0 //Black Triangles 633 Models<br>
Either comment it out, or delete it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheap hack the item models to have a different shade of black:<br>
<a href="http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/snippets/377457-pi-fixing-pitch-black-models.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/snippets/377457-pi-fixing-pitch-black-models.html</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically it’s just adding this to the items:</p>
<p><code>
itemDef.editedModelColor = new int[1];
itemDef.newModelColor = new int[1];
itemDef.editedModelColor[0] = 0;
itemDef.newModelColor[0] = 4;</code></p>

or<br>
Your item has quads.</p>
