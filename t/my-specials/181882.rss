    <description>hi, I&#39;ve created my own type of special and have added it to boolean attack, but the only problem is...is that it will automatically attack the person whether you click anything or not :(. is there a way to have the spec bar show up so you can click on it to use the special only and not be able to use the attack automatically? it [b] would[/b] be fine but it keeps spamming to the player that they don&#39;t have enough energy etc....</description>
