    <description>Could someone please guide me in the right direction with client gameframes?

The thing is, I have a client, but I want to change the gameframe, because It&#39;s currently a 503 gameframe, and personally, I looks horrible, I&#39;ve tried putting on a 474+ gameframe, but it just doesn&#39;t fit. The minimap is black, chatbox is screwed up etc. I was wondering which class file I would need to go into to fix this.</description>
