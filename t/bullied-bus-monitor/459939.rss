    <title>Bullied bus monitor</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/bullied-bus-monitor/459939</link>
    <description>I was debating on whether or not to put this under Intellectual Debates or General Discussion. I chose Intellectual Debates, obviously.

Anyways. On Thursday, during school I was watching Channel 1 and saw something about a bus monitor getting bullied, and I decided to look into it further. I went on YouTube and found this video:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ9n8JQJy2c
Please be aware, the kids do use vulgar language. If you can&#39;t stand to see the sight of bullying, please don&#39;t watch this video. As it makes some people cry.

Moving on. As I kept researching the topic, I found more out. Someone on indiegogo decided to help out Karen H. Klein. He raised over 500,000$+ to help her retire and go on a dream vacation.

Anyways, I want all of your opinions on this. Discuss.</description>

<p>hoooly crap.  i didn’t watch it completely, but ooh… I wouldn’t hit them if I ever saw some kids bullying somebody else, I would get in their face, lift their asses up, pin them against the wall and start talking some shit about how does it feel.  I wouldn’t risk going to jail just because some kids have nothing else to do.  I would rather do that to other kids or at least scar them for life in a non-violent way, rather than wasting my life on one group of kids.</p>
<p>If somebody did that to my mom or grandma or any of my relatives or even friends, I would beat the shit out of them regardless of what I said above.</p>

I got bullied and my ass kicked every single day at school. The schools failed to protect me. I never got any pity or money lol.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Did you ever think of standing up to them/fighting back?[/quote]</p>
<p>Sure did, only in my case it was me vs. the entire school, not just a couple of bullys. Thats why I was black and blue every day coming home and a few times even knocked unconcious lol… Usually it took the whole summer for my bruises to heal, only for them to come back the first day of school <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> I think a lot of people would have cracked if they had to endure what I did, but I was optimistic always and never let it get me down. I had friends from other schools who didn’t look down on my condition. Looking back, we were stupid kids that knew nothing. By grade 9 is when I started to properly fight back and I broke a few people’s noses and they never fucked with me again. By the end of highschool people had matured and I was just like everyone else, went partying and had friends. I also don’t have alopecia anymore. I’ve been done school for 5 years and i’ve only been shown respect. My optimism paid off.</p>

<p>Lol’d.</p>
<p>In Scotland bullying isn’t all that common if I’m honest, or at least it wasn’t at my School. Kidpaparoach may tell me otherwise. If two people have some form of issue or a group of people and one guy have an issue they just take the leader outside, give him a square go, winner wins and loser loses.</p>
<p>Moral of the story; if you’re ever in Scotland and you don’t back up your point then someone asks if you want to go outside, unless you’re certain you can deplete his pride don’t do it.</p>
