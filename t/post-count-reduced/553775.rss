    <title>Post Count reduced?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/post-count-reduced/553775</link>
    <description>It appears since 2007 I have lost my postcount, either that or I am currently on the wrong account. I know I haven&#39;t been in the scene for a few years however I do know that I was both an active member here and on another forum.

Regardless, I have returned and I look forward to spreading the knowledge that I have gained over the years to those whom are just getting into it, or have been for awhile.</description>

              <p>I can see your old posts are in the MITB Trash can from 2007, probably cant restore them because of the merge where the sections got deleted.</p>
