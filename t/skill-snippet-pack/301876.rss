    <title>Skill snippet pack</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/skill-snippet-pack/301876</link>
    <description>ok as i was going through cleaning up my scource a little bit i had some time to get out a bit of skills and parts of cases that deals with skills.
i take no credit for writing most of these and give credits to whomever wrote them. i had edited some, rewrote a couple but take very little credit for writing.
only for gathering and rewriting.


well here is a link, take a look its just some notepad files all named with the skill and there should be a little bit of directions or its just common sense that you add it under the implements runnable(a few could be added into event manager). well ty for downloading and these should be compatible with ALL scources.
