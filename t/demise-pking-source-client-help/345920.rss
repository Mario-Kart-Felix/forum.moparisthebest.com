    <description>hello again..

I&#39;ve got my server + source (demise pking)
I need help with this thing:

The whole world is a pk area, but I don&#39;t want that. If I can make non-pvp area&#39;s I can make a skiller area, because there&#39;s no way of making money atm.

And if you kill someone, he doesn&#39;t die! he keeps standing and than his hp is restored, but all the items are dropped.

The donator shops have some null&#39;s and I don&#39;t know how to fix the items...

Anyone who uses thies source/client or anyone who knows how to solve this, help me please 

Thanks again</description>
