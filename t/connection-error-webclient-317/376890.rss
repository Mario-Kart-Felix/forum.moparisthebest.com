    <title>Connection Error, Webclient [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/connection-error-webclient-317/376890</link>
    <description>Hey Guys,
I was making a Web Client for my server, Edited the client so it&#39;d download the cache, Jarred it, Signed it, etc. Now I uploaded the client.jar file to mediafire, used that link in the PHP script, Uploaded the cache.zip to FileDen, now here is my problem:
When I startup my webclient, it downloads the cache, when it&#39;s done downloading it, it says &quot;Connection error, Retrying in 60, 59 etc etc.&quot;.
I&#39;m pretty lost what the cause of this is, it might be something with the cache?
Anyone got a suggestion what I could do to fix this?
Thanks in advance.

Kind Regards,
