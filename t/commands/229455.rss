    <description>     I was recently working in client.java and changed around a lot of stuff.  I got no errors but I realised a lot of commands wouldn&#39;t work such as ::char, ::npc, ::yell, etc.  I checked my backups and changed all the stuff back that I had modified right before the commands wouldn&#39;t work, my compiler read 100 errors.  I have no idea what to do and I havn&#39;t backed up in quite a long time so I definatelly don&#39;t want to c/p everything from my backups.  Help?</description>

              <p>How about post the error. (The first error)</p>
<p>Itâ€™s probably a missing bracket, or an extra one.</p>
