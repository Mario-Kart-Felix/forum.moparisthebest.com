    <description>What commands does everyone think are needed in a server?

Also, what does everyone think about global chat? Should there be a ::say command that everyone can use freely? Should people need to spend GP for each message? What do you guys think would be a good way to curb all the stupid shit that is said in global chat? Should there even be global chat?</description>

<p>Frankly I don’t agree with pricing things at any point that allow the community to come closer. I know it’s not strictly RSC-like, but global chat would improve the game in a low-density environment (such as a private server).</p>

              <p>[quote=“Lothy, post:9, topic:526436”]I think global chat is one of those things that grows more important as the game’s population density decreases. I wouldn’t put a price on it because then you effectively lock newcomers out of it.[/quote]The price could increase with their playtime, then be capped at some amount. Alternatively, the fee can be introduced after a certain point; after they use X global messages or have played for X amount of hours.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:9, topic:526436”]Perhaps player-based moderation would be key. Players, if they come across a spammer, can enter a command to vote in favour of banning him. If a certain percentage of online players vote in favour of the ban then the spammer is muted temporarily (perhaps 30 to 60 minutes). The mute could apply to the logged in account only, every player account associated with the person’s forum account, or even the IP address.<br>
There’s the risk of abuse I suppose, but that’s always the case with ‘mark as spam’ approaches. Even if there is a miscarriage of justice though, it would be short-lived. And if certain people were obviously being victimised then perhaps some sort of exemption could be applied to their account.[/quote]I don’t think player-based moderation will work very well when action is required quickly. There are a bunch of groups that would systematically mute other groups or individuals. I can easily see people just voting to shut people up who are voicing legitimate concerns, because they don’t have all the details.</p>
<p>For example, people who bitch about getting gangbanged in the wild shouldn’t be able to bitch about it over global, seeing it’s not the appropriate medium and causes all sorts of trouble. Meanwhile, someone who just got scammed by a popular member should be able to communicate it through global chat.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lothy, post:9, topic:526436”]EDIT: That, or you could just make the ignore list functional for global chat as well.[/quote]That solves an entirely different problem of people harassing others via global chat. It doesn’t really remove people who just use global chat to constantly bitch about things.</p>
