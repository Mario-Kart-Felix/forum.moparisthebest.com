    <description>hey, I got some commands I need some help adding.. my source is MTP v2... 

I want to add commands like:
::rules
::jail
::vent (one that makes other players say things)
and ::commands but only mods and staff can use the ::commands cause only staff CAN use commands... how can I add these?

I am not a coder I only know these things:
how to change weapon stats

change ip
itemspawn commands
mute
ban lol

anyway any help is great!

also i want  to add customs but the client doesn&#39;t have a model folder nor does it have a class8.java...

how can i fix this/add customs?</description>
