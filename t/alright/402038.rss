    <title>Alright</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/alright/402038</link>
    <description>Sup everyone, some among you may already know me, some don&#39;t.

Me &amp; 2 others were about to resurrect RSCAngel back for a backbone on Mopar-RSC, since nobody heard a thing for weeks.
But since recently i got the feeling there is still being worked on, so i thought, it would be best to transfer the RSCAngel group to Mopar-RSC, since that&#39;s what Mopar need.

So [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,491985.0.html]this[/url] is the to-do list still, sounds like the game itself is about finished and ready to go.
The integration into moparscape 4, how is that so important?  does it have better update possibilities when it runs along mopar 4?

Couldn&#39;t we launch the Closed Beta, with the expression on Closed, with a regular .jnlp file?
Then a group of chosen ppl could already test everything and tell around that the game is eventually opening for public.</description>

<p>Yep, am doing that, no need to bite my nose off <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
Ppl have been waiting for more than 2 months, i understand it can’t be done on 1 or 2 weeks, but since xEnt is busy inreal, things have been slowing down even more, i would like to prevent that from happening, since it’s giving a very bad image to Mopar.</p>
<p>Having that said, i see things are slowly picking up again, just a few bug struggling i read.</p>
