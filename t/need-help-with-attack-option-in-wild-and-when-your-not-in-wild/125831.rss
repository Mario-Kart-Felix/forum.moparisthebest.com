    <description>Okay i have this code that makes the attack option come up if you are in the mage arena.
[code]                                if(absX &gt;= 3091 &amp;&amp; absX &lt;= 3120 &amp;&amp; absY &gt;=3929  &amp;&amp; absY &lt;=3946)
{
			outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
			outStream.writeByteC(3);		// command slot (does it matter which one?)
			outStream.writeByteA(1);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
			outStream.writeString(&quot;@red@Attack&quot;);
			outStream.endFrameVarSize();
			IsInWilderness = true;
		}
                                else
{
			outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
			outStream.writeByteC(3);		// command slot (does it matter which one?)
			outStream.writeByteA(1);		// 0 or 1; 1 if command should be placed on top in context menu
			outStream.writeString(&quot;@red@Attack&quot;);
			outStream.endFrameVarSize();
			IsInWilderness = false;
		}

}[/code]

BUT! i want to make it so the attack option goes away when you arn&#39;t in the mage arena. How the heck do i do that. Tell me what to replace the second part after } else { with....please  :D</description>
