    <title>Using hamachi... Problems</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/using-hamachi-problems/170083</link>
    <description>Mkay like my 188th post here I believe lol. I think 127 was posts to benefit ppl and the others topics I made. heh. Anyways does anyone have any idea how to get Hamachi to work as a no-ip and how would i go about getting it free. i used a trial and my trials up and i only used it once about 5 months ago when I first began. I would like to figure Hamachi out because I can&#39;t use my router no more, it crashes each time I get too many players. I&#39;m planning to bring my old server back if I can ever get this thing working. :\

&lt;3 all help i can get
My msn should be memorized by now but why not:
