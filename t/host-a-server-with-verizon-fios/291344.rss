    <title>Host a server with verizon fios?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/host-a-server-with-verizon-fios/291344</link>
    <description>IS it possible to host a server with verizon fios because i use no-ip and have my server running and everything but it says its offline, so i go to use uttorent to portforward it with and it still doesnt work and i did start the server before running uttorent, I have the ports open in firewall udp and tcp. So do i have to portforward with a verizon fios router/modem? because its kinda confusing can anyone help?</description>
