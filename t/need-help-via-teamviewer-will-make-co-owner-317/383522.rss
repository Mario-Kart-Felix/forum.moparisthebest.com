    <title>Need Help Via Teamviewer! Will make Co-Owner [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-via-teamviewer-will-make-co-owner-317/383522</link>
    <description>I have a 317 server and client. They are set up for me to use.. they are online and the ports are all good, but what I don&#39;t understand is that the server won&#39;t play on anything except my client made for it unless it&#39;s on Moparscape&#39;s default ip, 192.0.0.1. That&#39;s the only way it works (even then it closes immediately). How do I get it to work on webclients with my No-IP? Need teamviewer help now please!

EDIT: My Teamviewer is ID: 410698004

              <p>aren’t you meant to use your own default ip which is: 127.0.0.1 check on whatismyip(dot)com to find your ip that way <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
