I’m assuming you’re referring to the DayZ mod, which is great but wasn’t 99% of the game just ripped from Arma II? Which is fine, it’s just hard to compare a mod of a game to games actually being developed for zombie survival. From what I have heard/seen, the actual DayZ game is shit and broken.</p>
<p>I really hope Survive The Nights follows through and becomes a fully fledged zombie survival game. Also hope they find a way to curb it from turning into a shitfest of PvP like pretty much all survival games have ended up being.</p>

No, I mean the Standalone. The mod wasn’t 99% ripped from A2 either, it used the engine, the map, some weapons and some vehicles were all that were taken from A2.</p>
<p>The Standalone itself is miles ahead of all of these games, it’s not completely broken, it’s quite playable and has incredible crafting, medical and weapon mechanics. The developers however just make an arse of it and make the game shit.</p>

That’s a really good point, and is also a point to be made about leveling skills in zombie survivals. I personally would love to have a zombie survival game that used the same model as GTA: San Andreas. The more you use a skill the better you get, and if you neglect it then your skill decreases over time. You’re absolutely right that being able to maintain a car is a ridiculous idea to think that everyone has that skill, but if a mechanic skill was implemented then as you attempted to “tinker” with automobiles then your knowledge increases. And if you wanted to get real fucking literal, collecting car manuals and being able to utilize them would be even more cool to help players learn and maybe provide faster repairs on vehicles they have the manual for. It would make them highly valuable and create an economy around scavenging for parts, manuals, etc.</p>
<p>Plus I also feel that if skills existed then groups would become more common and it might decrease the bloodshed, as players would be more cautious and may attempt to find valuable players that have specific skill sets.</p>

        <p>The problem is going that indepth to have a skill, it then becomes more grindy and MMO-like other than just a survival sandbox.</p>
<p>Hicks has stated that the implementation for cars will be MUCH more difficult than the mod, which I fully support but I’d like to see it even harder to get a car. I remember the days when myself and my buddies would play for a good 10 hour straight just to get a car up and running in the mod, only for it to be stolen the next day. It’s one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in a game in my life, I’d like it to be even harder to get that vehicle.</p>
<p>Hicks has stated that it’s now going to be rather than just finding a “toolbox” like you did in the mod, you will have to collect all of the tools to fill this box. The right tool for the right job and all that kind of stuff. Even down to the anti-theft nuts on some models of cars wheels, they’ll have to have a certain key for it. Fanbelt adjustments, oil replacements, radiator patches, tyre wear, brake pad replacements, chassis repairs will all be a part of the game. The welding mask is already in, actually. It’s going to make it so that you have to diagnose the car yourself, you can’t just see in the top left of your screen if your wheels, hull, engine or fuel system is damaged. You’ll have a live needle on the dash telling you your fuel, warning lights etc. It’s going to be very indepth but once again, I don’t really support it.</p>
<p>He’s said there will be 10 cars to a server, 10 still feels too much for me. That’s 40 less than was in the mod per server but it still feels too much, I’d like to see maybe 2 per server. I feel that would make it so much more of an advantage for you and your team to spend days searching for replacement parts and tools and the reward at the end would be fantastic. Just my two cents as someone who has played over 1700 hours between the mod and the standalone.</p>
