    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-npc-trading-problems/371961</link>
    <description>Just a little help, I made some new shops; Shop = 11, Shop = 12, and Shop = 13. Ok so I go trade the shopkeepers for Shops 12 &amp; 13 and i can buy the items. But when I click on shop number 11, it won&#39;t let me buy any items, it still says &quot;This item costs 187k&quot; but why won&#39;t it let me buy it?

Another Question: When I&#39;m trading a person and try to click &quot;offer all&quot; or &quot;Remove all&quot; I get this message saying &#39;You can&#39;t store items while trading!&#39; and it won&#39;t let me put the item in, how do I fix this?

I will Rep++, Thanks.</description>
