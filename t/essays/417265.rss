    <description>I&#39;m in 9th grade, and I&#39;ve been having serious trouble with essays.

Recently we had a two page (double-spaced, not long) I believe essay in English, and a five-paragraph in-class essay in U.S. Government.

Do any of you have tips for writing?

P.S. I actually haven&#39;t completed the I believe essay yet, I&#39;ve written two paragraphs and I&#39;m stuck.</description>

Anyways, an “I believe” paper should be really easy to write, pick a topic, and just write.  Try and find information to back up why you believe in it.</p>
<p>For government: Really, this is going to be based on whatever you are talking about…</p>

<p>Try to make up shit. Honestly, they have no way of calling you on your bull shit. Plus, a lot of your English essay are going to have bullshit in them; Because English essays are more about rhetoric than fact. If you use big words the right way, you can sound like you know what you’re talking about even though you don’t. It’s the reason law students take rhetoric ^^</p>

<p>I mainly need help with the I believe essay, because I have already told a story and given the reader background knowledge, yet I have just two or three paragraphs.</p>
<p>I also need help with one more thing. I’m also supposed to write a paragraph about the purpose of a story. I find it extremely hard/annoying to discover the purpose, so I was wondering if you had any little techniques involving keywords or anything else. (If you would like to read the short story we have to find the purpose of, just google Harrison Bergeron.)</p>

              <p>Topic ideas:</p>
<p>Religion<br>
Forms of government<br>
-democracy<br>
-socialism<br>
World issues<br>
-middle east conflict<br>
-hunger, famine<br>
People<br>
-racism<br>
-immigration<br>
Theories<br>
-science<br>
-conspiricy theories</p>
<p>For a strong essay, you’re going to want an introduction paragraph, 3 body paragraphs, and a conclusion.</p>
<p>Lets use “9/11 conspiracies” as an example</p>
<p>For the introduction paragraph, use the funnel technique. Make a broad statement to start with, such as “One of the most impacting days in modern American history would be the 9/11 terrorist attacks”. Then, funnel your way down to a thesis, such as “the 9/11 attacks were actually an attack on America by itself to rally the public so they could go to war with the middle east”. Normally, avoid using “I believe” in any formal paper unless noted otherwise. The sentence after, give 3 examples, which will be the topic for your body paragraphs. “This is because the USA’s need for oil, the lack of plane parts at the Pentagon, and that the towers falling was in a demolition style.”</p>
<p>Now, those 3 points will be the topic sentence for the next 3 paragraphs, which should fill up the majority of your paper. All of your arguements and the support go in here, just remember to take your time and don’t overlook anything. Teachers typically like 3 examples per paragraph. For the controlled demolition paragraph, you could state:<br>
-the force of the planes impact<br>
-the fires heat not hot enough to melt the steel frame<br>
-the buildings falling downward, not toward another building</p>
<p>Then, the conclusion paragraph. It’s basically a reverse funnel. Restate your thesis and the 3 points, then slowly broaden out to a general yet CLOSING statement. Don’t leave the reader hanging.</p>
<p>Hope all of this helped, and no, these are not my views on 9/11.</p>

<p>It’s literally writing an essay on a belief of yours. You provide a story from your life that you think may have led you to that belief.<br>
Essentially, it’s literally starting the paper with, “I believe in…” and backing it up with a story and two pages of writing.</p>

We read several articles/“readings”, and we got a question just before we started writing the essay. It was sort of, preparing for what was coming… Which was odd, because I’ve never had to do that before. Edit: <a class="mention" href="/u/reyx7">@reyx7</a>, it was using quotes to back up a thesis.</p>
<p>In English:<br>
The I believe essay is essentially about anything you believe in (they have a website online, or you may have heard them reading essays submitted to them in your childhood on the radio). It’s very tough for me because it’s two pages of writing about the same topic, using only your memory and background knowledge. You can’t exactly prepare for it, or read anything to help you.</p>
