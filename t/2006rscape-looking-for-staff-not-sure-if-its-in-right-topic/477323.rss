              <p>we only just started out this remake… cleaning out one of the fail pi’s to make it look old <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>
<p>But then forgotten we need site developers… cause all i know is mybb/mysmf… it will look good with simpleportal, but we need something like the original 2006, and there my problem :/…</p>
<p>Sure i can rip 2006 and make it html, but imagen the effort it will be to keep updating it, and changing the ftp…</p>
