&lt;blockquote&gt;Cannabis laws set to be reviewed
Cannabis
Cannabis laws have proved controversial
Laws making possession of cannabis a largely non-arrestable offence could be reversed, Gordon Brown has said.

The prime minister told MPs a consultation on reclassifying cannabis will be launched next week as part of a review of the entire UK drugs strategy.

The drug was downgraded to class C - which includes things such as anabolic steroids - from class B, which includes things like amphetamines, in 2004.

But there are fears more harmful forms of the drug have become available.

A Home Office spokesman said the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) will be asked to review reports that danger from cannabis is increasing due to wider availability of more potent strains such as &quot;skunk&quot;.

There is concern stronger varieties of the drug can cause mental health problems.

Medicinal use

Mr Brown said the Cabinet had discussed the issue and Home Secretary Jacqui Smith would publish a consultation document next week about the UK drugs strategy.

	
Recently, there have been various forms of herbal or grass-type cannabis that are generally found to be stronger than ordinary &#39;weed&#39;
Home Office drugs advice website

Mr Brown told MPs at prime minister&#39;s questions: &quot;She will be asking the public to comment on new ways in which we can improve drugs education in the country, give support to people undergoing treatment... and give support for communities who want to chase out drug dealers from their communities.&quot;

He was responding to a question from Labour MP Martin Salter who, referring to the medicinal use of cannabis, urged a drugs policy that did not &quot;criminalise the sick but tackles the drugs that do the most harm&quot;.

The issue of downgrading - or even decriminalising - cannabis - has proved controversial and has already been reviewed once by the Home Office.

Urgent research

The original move from Class B to Class C was made when David Blunkett was home secretary.

His successor Charles Clarke asked for a review in 2005.

At that time the ACMD said that while cannabis was undoubtedly harmful it was still less harmful than other drugs like amphetamines which are in Class B. It recommended no change.

But it also called for urgent further research on the potency and pattern of cannabis use.

If the ACMD were to back a change in classification and the Home Office accepted its recommendation, it would require agreement of both houses of Parliament to become law.

Potent varieties

A Home Office spokesman said: &quot;We will be asking the ACMD to review the classification of cannabis, given the increase in strength of some cannabis strains and their potential harms.

&quot;It would be wrong to prejudge that review which shows how seriously we take our priority of reducing drug-related harm.&quot;

The Home Office&#39;s drugs information website, Frank, includes details of new more potent varieties of cannabis.

It says: &quot;Recently, there have been various forms of herbal or grass-type cannabis that are generally found to be stronger than ordinary &#39;weed&#39;, containing on average two to three times the amount of the active compound, THC.

&quot;These include sinsemilla (a bud grown in the absence of male plants and which has no seeds), homegrown, skunk (which has a particular strong smell) and netherweed.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is absurd! I thought lib dems wanted it to be legalized.</description>

<p>Agreed, but you can’t blame the guy 100%, a while back the UK had a big infestation of this weed with sand and glass and shit in it, it got everywhere like a dodgy STD, i was offered it a few times and I thought I only knew cool dealers. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

</aside>
<p>Exactly. Around here, solid as we call hashish is more popular because you need to buy more weed, witch is more expensive($30 an eighth for weed, $18 an eighth of hashish) just to get high, and hashish usually lasts longer.</p>

<p>No it’s going to class b, because of again, dealers. One of my friends caught a dealer selling shit outside a fucking school so we jumped him.

<p>That may be possible, but I find it unlikely. Salvinorin A, the main psychoactive chemical in Salvia, needs to be vaporized at a much higher temperture. A constant flame needs to be held on it, and for best results a butane torch should be used. The smoke isn’t really what gets you high, it’s the vaporized chemical that you are looking for. Also a joint is such a waste, a proper hit of 60x from a pipe or bong would send you into a hardcore mind blowing world in your own head. 2 grams of 40x salvia has gotten me and 2 other friends high everyday for the past week.</p>
<p>As for the glass in the marijuana, get better sources. I always get it straight from trusted growers, not street corner dealers etc. And if you ask me, strains with more THC are less harmful because you need to smoke less to achieve desirable effects.

<p>Skunk is just a strain. If you’re going to tell me it’s somehow more dangerous than other high-potency strains, I’m going to laugh. If you’re going to tell me it has somehow got “different chemicals” in it (a nurse told me this the other day) I will laugh.</p>

              <p>Old school Cannabis is good, still smoke that stuff, however im experimenting stuff like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_divinorum" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_divinorum</a> Very good stuff this, 100% legal where i come from (Uk). A joint of it feels like 4hours but is really 10-15mins, it warps time and visualness, you hallucinate. As for cannabis well ive smoked so much it dosn’t do much to me just makes my pupils either huge or tiny, i miss the old chilled “stoned” feeling. Going to B probably to scare people, but if you like it enough and are only carrying £10 worth, you wont give a shit.</p>
