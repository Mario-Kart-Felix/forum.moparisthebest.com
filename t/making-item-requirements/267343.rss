    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-item-requirements/267343</link>
    <description>alright, i used an unused int. in my more info files. But i cant get it to need that to equip an item. How can i make an item with the requirements, past the pre-set ones if i cannot find them. here is my code. I CHECKED IT AND THIS INT. IS UN-USED IN THIS SOURCE!! BEFORE YOU FLAME ME!!

THIS IS IN MY CLIENT.JAVA FOLDER!
[code]
case 13664: // Dragon Claws
	if (cluestage &gt;= 1) {
		txt4 = &quot;Muahahahaha!&quot;;
sendMessage(&quot;Nice, keep up the good work to keep mem status&quot;);
	} else if (cluestage &lt;= 0) {
		sendMessage(&quot;HAHA, you need to be a member for these&quot;);
	}
[/code]
