    <title>::players not working properly[317] Delta</title>

    <description>Hello, my server has a somewhat working ::players command, but it doesn&#39;t exactly work 100%. I tends to not display a player (Only one player is not displayed), and I can&#39;t figure out how it works, I think it might be the first person on the server, doesn&#39;t get their name displayed. But here&#39;s the command
[code] if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;players&quot;)) {
			sM(&quot;There are currently &quot; + PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount()
					+ &quot; players!&quot;);
			sendQuest(&quot;@dre@Runestrike - Online Players&quot;, 8144);
			clearQuestInterface();
			sendQuest(&quot;@dbl@Online players(&quot; + PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount()
					+ &quot;):&quot;, 8145);
			int line = 8146;
			for (int i = 1; i &lt; PlayerHandler.maxPlayers; i++) {
				client playa = getClient(i);
				if (!validClient(i))
					continue;
				if (playa.playerName != null) {
					String title = &quot;&quot;;
					if (playa.playerRights == 1) {
						title = &quot;Mod, &quot;;
					} else if (playa.playerRights == 2) {
						title = &quot;Admin, &quot;;
					}
					title += &quot;level-&quot; + playa.combatLevel;
					String extra = &quot;&quot;;
					if (playerRights &gt; 0) {
						extra = &quot;(&quot; + playa.playerId + &quot;) &quot;;
					}
					sendQuest(&quot;@dre@&quot; + extra + playa.playerName + &quot;@dbl@ (&quot;
							+ title + &quot;) is at &quot; + playa.absX + &quot;, &quot;
							+ playa.absY, line);
					line++;
				}
			}[/code]

Yes I tried changing the &#39;for loop&#39; from index 1 to 0, the problem continued.</description>
