    <title>Paying for private servers and more</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paying-for-private-servers-and-more/261879</link>
    <description>You may have read the recent announcement, if not perhaps you should:
http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,345710.msg2665259.html#new

All of this money (currently more than $1000/month) will be used to pay for the development of extremely good private servers or private server utilities (such as map or model editors, or maybe something I haven&#39;t even thought of!).  The staff is helping me work out the details of how this will work, but this post is to inform you our intentions now.

Rather than actually &#39;hiring&#39; developers to write a server to our specifications (which will be forthcoming, and very specific), we will instead allow anyone (including you!) to work on it by themselves or as a group as you see fit.  After your server is done, you can submit it to us, and if it meets our specifications we will pay you to release it freely under the [url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html]GNU/GPL[/url] (other similar licenses may be considered, if you wish) (as opposed to actually buying the server from you), this way you will retain copyright and ownership rights on the server.

Some preliminary requirements we have thought of are:

[ol][li]Code under [url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html]GNU/AGPL[/url], or similar license, and released free of charge.  (of course we will pay you to do this, that is the whole point)[/li]
[li]Platform independent code.  Don&#39;t lock your code to Windows, Linux, MAC or FreeBSD.  There is no reason it shouldn&#39;t run on all of them.[/li]
[li]Support for 1000+ players online simultaneously, running on decent hardware.[sub]3[/sub][/li]
[li]All basic functionality complete.  (in other words, you don&#39;t need quests completed, but all basic skills[sub]1[/sub] should function, all doors, ladders, trapdoors and such should work correctly etc)[/li]
[li]The functionality should be independent of the client version[sub]2[/sub], in other words you need to have a packet encoder/decoder that is specific to a client version, that decodes packets to a version independent format that is then passed onto the game logic script(s).  (if you need clarification, let me know)[/li]
[li](optional[sub]4[/sub], but would be a great bonus, and easier for you)  Scripting support for the game logic.  Examples of good languages you could use would be python, ruby or javascript.  You could also use any other language or even write your own if you feel particularly masochistic.  [/li][/ol]


So you may start coding now if you want, any language is fine if it meets our requirements.
[size=20pt]
Current money available: over $9000[/size]

Clarifications:
[1] By &#39;basic skills&#39; I would say at minimum magic, attack, defense, strength, range, mining, woodcutting, firemaking, fishing, cooking.  Possibly a few more simple ones I am forgetting.  I am not talking about farming, slayer etc.  Although the more game logic implemented the more money you would be payed for your server.
[2] The client version you use doesn&#39;t matter to me at all, just keep in mind that the only thing in your server that should be specific to any version is an encoder and decoder.  A [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/downloads/srcPackaged.tar.gz]317 client I like[/url] is the one I removed all dummy variables from, refactored to Aryan specs and started to separate into packages.  But you are free to use any you desire
[3] Some people have expressed concern that 1000 players is not doable on &#39;decent hardware&#39;, this number is just an estimate.  I believe it [i]should[/i] be possible, but if your code is designed well and not inherently flawed in any way, yet you cannot support exactly this number of players, it may still be eligible.  Basically what I am trying to say is if you think you can&#39;t meet this requirement, you should still try for it and you will still be paid for your work.
[4] I have been asked how much less you would be paid if you didn&#39;t implement scripting.  I think somewhere between $500-$1000 dollars less would be fair, which would make your final payment $8000-$8500.

Comments? Suggestions? Do you think this is a good idea or do you have ideas to improve it?

[hr]
[anchor=client]
[size=24pt]I am now paying $100 for each open-source client and server combination that runs in MoparScape 4.1.[/size][/anchor]

You just have to download the released MoparScape source code and implement an interface for the client and one for the server:
http://cache.hybridscape.com/MoparScapeSources.jar

Both of the interfaces need to be implemented completely for the $100 payout, the server doesn&#39;t need to be much at all, as long as logging in and walking around is supported it is good enough for me.  The server doesn&#39;t even have to be written by you, as long as the license allows you to modify and redistribute it.  The server jar is delivered in a zip file that contains the jar with the code as well as the files the server needs to run.  For an example of the correct structure, have a look at:
http://graveman.info/server317.zip

I will only pay this fee on a first come first serve basis for each version number.  For example, if I get 5 PMs tomorrow all from different people who implemented this for 525 only the first will be paid.

[u]Versions already completed, and who by:[/u]

As always, if you have any questions or concerns post them.</description>

I believe you should look into a 517 :).<br>
[/quote]It’s a 508 <span class="bbcode-b">LOADING</span> 525. It is <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> a 517.<br>
[/quote]What is?<br>
[/quote]I’ve never seen a 517 server or client released. I might be mistaken, but I’ve only seen ones that are 508’s loading the 525 cache, in which case it is NOT a 517 server.<br>
[/quote]Exactly, God damnit. I didn’t say a 508 loading 525 cache, i said a 517 as in a server and a client. there has to be a 517 deob out there, if anything someone could use an outdated rsbot client and get a deob from that.[/quote]</p>

              <p>I am now paying $100 for each open-source client and server combination that runs in MoparScape 4.1.</p>
<p>You just have to download the released MoparScape source code and implement an interface for the client and one for the server:<br>
<a href="http://cache.hybridscape.com/MoparScapeSources.jar" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cache.hybridscape.com/MoparScapeSources.jar</a></p>
<p>Both of the interfaces need to be implemented completely for the $100 payout, the server doesn’t need to be much at all, as long as logging in and walking around is supported it is good enough for me.  The server doesn’t even have to be written by you, as long as the license allows you to modify and redistribute it.  The server jar is delivered in a zip file that contains the jar with the code as well as the files the server needs to run.  For an example of the correct structure, have a look at:<br>
<a href="http://graveman.info/server317.zip" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://graveman.info/server317.zip</a></p>
<p>I will only pay this fee on a first come first serve basis for each version number.  For example, if I get 5 PMs tomorrow all from different people who implemented this for 525 only the first will be paid.</p>
<p>Links are dead for one of em. I was also wondering if theres clarification then on the structure (a screenie even) or better yet clarification on what exactly is the requirements.</p>
