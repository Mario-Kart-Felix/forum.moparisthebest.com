    <description>Tbh its making me mad that everytime i come on there is a bunch of people advertising stuff.

As I post this there is 2 kids spamming every section of the forums. If there was one mod on it would have been prevented easily. So because i dont like to look at the advertisements for 5 hours before it finally gets locked, i think some more people should be promoted to mod.

-Discuss what you think and I still think half the advertisers would be prevented if there was a advertising section</description>

              <p>I will also add that if you report a topic and no action is taken within a day it is probably because the moderator that initially dealt with that report decided to take no action by his/her own discretion. The topic may be locked/deleted later (possibly days) by another moderator that decides an action is necessary. Basically, the staff have guidelines but some moderators may lock a topic when others wouldn’t.</p>

There are no Australian moderators so nobody covers those time zones!!</p>

It’s summer. We don’t sit here all day looking at MoparScape, browsing sections, checking a box, and then searching for more topics. When I log on, I do the reports, check the General Discussion/General Programming boards, and close the tab for MoparScape.<br>
[/quote].</p>
<p>Well then you should be searching for more places to look such as tutorial sections, and help sections. I don’t “record” how long it takes to report it, i usually find several topics to be reported, and I can only report once every 80 seconds, and I usually am not patient enough to wait that time.[/quote]</p>
<p>Major sections are covered by The Soul and other moderators. Our moderation team highly relies on the report system to keep the sections clean. We are not online enough to keep browsing sections and to check every thread. We are still working on portforwarding question issues.</p>
<p>People will post topics complaining about how our staff sucks, when with the above said, they don’t report anything. Every other time I moderate I will check the Server Help section and sometimes the Download section. With such a large group of members in the Download section, a lot of the topics are reported anyway.</p>

<p>Well then you should be searching for more places to look such as tutorial sections, and help sections. I don’t “record” how long it takes to report it, i usually find several topics to be reported, and I can only report once every 80 seconds, and I usually am not patient enough to wait that time.</p>

</aside>
<p>So report it instead of recording how many days it took for us to lock it.</p>
<p>We don’t need an advertising section. The ‘advertising’ section we have right now redirects to the server status page. What difference will it make adding a new section? Also, how would it prevent advertising in other sections? People would think that they could mass-advertise in every single section.</p>
<p>I’m debating whether or not to lock this because myself along with other staff members are getting sick of suggestions being posted in the wrong place.<br>
@“Well those suggestions never get looked at” - Just because they aren’t accepted doesn’t mean they aren’t looked at.</p>
<p>It’s summer. We don’t sit here all day looking at MoparScape, browsing sections, checking a box, and then searching for more topics. When I log on, I do the reports, check the General Discussion/General Programming boards/sometimes the Server Help board, and close the tab for MoparScape.</p>

</aside>
<p>all those problems stated would be easily taken care of if people would report it instead of flame. I think maybe 1 or 2 more staff members wouldnt hurt but its not needed to much. the players when you think about it are half the staff themselves, considering some of them report the bad stuff.</p>

<p>We need more staff, and more sections. Your now saying we don’t want to be like R-S. Who said we can’t add an advertising board, and a page for it?</p>
<p>And the mods that are on, never check sections, and it sometimes takes 3-4 days to locked an unreported topic.</p>

<p>As I post this there is 2 kids spamming every section of the forums. If there was one mod on it would have been prevented easily. So because i dont like to look at the advertisements for 5 hours before it finally gets locked, i think some more people should be promoted to mod.</p>
<p>-Discuss what you think and I still think half the advertisers would be prevented if there was a advertising section</p>
