    <title>[PI] If player chat equals</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-if-player-chat-equals/450442</link>
    <description>Hello,

I&#39;m having fun with the PI base, just for learning purposes and having fun ofcource.
I have a quick question though:
How can I compare the chat that the player sended to another string and call a method if it&#39;s true?

I want to make an NPC say something after I say something like &#39;Lol&#39; (I need to check if the player is in the area of the NPC ofcource).
I know how to make a NPC say something, only not what the method is that handles the playerchat.
I&#39;ve searched for quite some time, but I just can&#39;t find it.
