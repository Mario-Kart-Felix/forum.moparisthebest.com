    <description>I have only tested this on CheezScape, because I personally love that server and the people on it, but this isn&#39;t to show everyone how to dupe. This is mainly for XeroCheez so he might be able to fix it. There is a way to dupe in your private server, cheez. It has something to do with you updating or doing whatever you do that causes your server to reset, so I&#39;m not sure if you can fix that or not. But here is what happens.

1.) When you are training, and you don&#39;t logout to save your xp/items, it all gets lost when the server gets reset, so I tested this out with thousands of runes and money and it worked.
2.) I had my friend Timmy give me 5mil that he had ingame, then he stayed logged in and I logged out and back in to save the 5mil I had, along with about 3k of each rune.
3.) When the server reset, Timmy had not saved the data that he had given away 5mil and a lot of runes, so when he logged back in he still had it all, and I also had it because I had relogged to save my character with all the items.

So I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s fixable or not, I was just wondering if you knew anything about how to fix it.</description>
