    <title>PayPal payment held</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/paypal-payment-held/522753</link>
    <description>Just recently, a payment made to me from someone that bought a virtual good from me was held by PayPal for further review, and it seems that the payment has been declared as an unauthorized purchase. The purchase was made on June 3, 2013, which means it has been 21 days since the payment was sent to me. I have backed up my virtual services with payment terms and even a refund policy, but this payment was completely handled and the buyer DID receive his virtual good, and I have proof. 

Anyways, I was wondering how these types of disputes usually turn out with PayPal?</description>

              <p>back when i ran a server i pretty much social-engineered my way out of most chargebacks. i had a nice win/loss ratio, but consider me lucky. also, remember that the two major types of chargebacks (unauthorized dispute and item not received) evidently have to be dealt with differently. my general strategy was to bs everything for the former (a little ironic because it wasn’t bs at all) and present a ‘this is a virtual item’ case for the latter, which theoretically should work all the time cuz paypal’s buyer protection doesn’t cover virtual goods (unless paypal changed its policy in the last two years.) it worked for me; it might not quite work for you.</p>
<p>you can try to present your ‘no refunds’ policy, but you cannot be certain that it will work.</p>
<p>it helps to possess good writing skills when writing to paypal. just remember to capitalize your sentences and use your best grammar in each rebuttal so you won’t look like a complete moron, and you’ll be fine.</p>

How about you remove his membership? Or if he was already using it, just ban him<br>

I haven’t take any action against his membership, and I’ll most likely wait until PayPal’s decision is final. I’ve heard that PayPal usually tends to rule in favor of the <span class="bbcode-b">buyer</span>, which is completely ridiculous in this case. The only reason I’m really paranoid about the outcome is that I’ve already used the money to go towards the server in which the memberships are given, so I’m pretty much in the negative. I’m going to try to call them by phone tomorrow and see what I can do, but from what I’ve seen so far, it seems like I’m fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the help so far, and I’ll let you all know what happens whenever I get in touch with PayPal. Thanks![/quote]</p>
<p>i’ve been in the negatives a few times before. it turned out to be okay though, although my biggest case (of about $400) took about half a year to complete. the end result? it felt great.</p>
<p>by the way, despite the odds, remember that paypal is actually on your side in this situation…</p>

              <p>A while back someone donated $50 to me. After receiving his shit he decided to do the same thing. His complaint was that the URL changed. I informed paypal that in fact the server was still up, etc etc. My account at that time was -$50. So paypal is losing money because you spend it. As long as you fight it I doubt paypal is going to do that to themselves. Needless to say, at the end of the dispute paypal was in favor of me as the seller and I have a feeling it was because of my acc balance.</p>

then make  your case. Your best bet is to literally show proof for everything, have video proof, etc. You should ask whack for more information. I had a huge message I sent him when he asked me about this but I have deleted it since then so yeah.<br>

then make  your case. Your best bet is to literally show proof for everything, have video proof, etc. You should ask whack for more information. I had a huge message I sent him when he asked me about this but I have deleted it since then so yeah.<br>

              <p>Just recently, a payment made to me from someone that bought a virtual good from me was held by PayPal for further review, and it seems that the payment has been declared as an unauthorized purchase. The purchase was made on June 3, 2013, which means it has been 21 days since the payment was sent to me. I have backed up my virtual services with payment terms and even a refund policy, but this payment was completely handled and the buyer DID receive his virtual good, and I have proof.</p>
<p>Anyways, I was wondering how these types of disputes usually turn out with PayPal?</p>
