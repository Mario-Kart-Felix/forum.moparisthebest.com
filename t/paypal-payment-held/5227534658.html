        <p>back when i ran a server i pretty much social-engineered my way out of most chargebacks. i had a nice win/loss ratio, but consider me lucky. also, remember that the two major types of chargebacks (unauthorized dispute and item not received) evidently have to be dealt with differently. my general strategy was to bs everything for the former (a little ironic because it wasn’t bs at all) and present a ‘this is a virtual item’ case for the latter, which theoretically should work all the time cuz paypal’s buyer protection doesn’t cover virtual goods (unless paypal changed its policy in the last two years.) it worked for me; it might not quite work for you.</p>
<p>you can try to present your ‘no refunds’ policy, but you cannot be certain that it will work.</p>
<p>it helps to possess good writing skills when writing to paypal. just remember to capitalize your sentences and use your best grammar in each rebuttal so you won’t look like a complete moron, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>[quote=“Tutorial, post:13, topic:522753”][quote author=Davidi2 link=topic=641251.msg4320394#msg4320394 date=1372144919]<br>
How about you remove his membership? Or if he was already using it, just ban him<br>
[/quote]<br>
I haven’t take any action against his membership, and I’ll most likely wait until PayPal’s decision is final. I’ve heard that PayPal usually tends to rule in favor of the <span class="bbcode-b">buyer</span>, which is completely ridiculous in this case. The only reason I’m really paranoid about the outcome is that I’ve already used the money to go towards the server in which the memberships are given, so I’m pretty much in the negative. I’m going to try to call them by phone tomorrow and see what I can do, but from what I’ve seen so far, it seems like I’m fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>I really appreciate the help so far, and I’ll let you all know what happens whenever I get in touch with PayPal. Thanks![/quote]</p>
<p>i’ve been in the negatives a few times before. it turned out to be okay though, although my biggest case (of about $400) took about half a year to complete. the end result? it felt great.</p>
<p>by the way, despite the odds, remember that paypal is actually on your side in this situation…</p>
