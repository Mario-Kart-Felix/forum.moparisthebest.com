    <title>Lag and autosave</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/lag-and-autosave/6761</link>
    <description>Ok, i rebuilt splidscape today, and its going really well, but i&#39;m getting complaints that its really laggy atm, if anyone knows a solution to this please let me know.

Also, i don&#39;t think that the autosave is working, a lot of people are moaning about this. It might be because i&#39;m rebooting a lot atm because i&#39;m changing server a lot.</description>
