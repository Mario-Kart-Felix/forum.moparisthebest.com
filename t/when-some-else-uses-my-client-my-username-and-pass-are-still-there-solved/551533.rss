              <p>Solution 1:<br>
Delete the .ini file that saves your username and password to the cache (As WarTusk-RSPS explained above).<br>
Solution 2:<br>
Login with false credentials (Example: An account with the user and pass as “test”) and then create the cache .zip. That way all users will get that as their default login, not yours.</p>

              <p>in your cache there is a saveuser.ini or something like that where any account you login to last it will save the username and password in the cache. so when you open the client your username and pass will be there still in that cache they download. When you upload your cache to drop box just make sure your username and password are not saved in the file. And it will not be a problem at all.</p>
