    <description>Hi all,

so, there are plenty of tools for RSC servers, none of them perfect. i was wondering if anyone would be interested in creating a fund, all of us donating money, and using that money to get some cheap asian programmers to create us what we want? or even create an android RSC client, or anything really. i don&#39;t think it would cost us a whole heap and we release them open source as community tools</description>
