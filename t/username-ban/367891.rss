    <title>Username ban?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/username-ban/367891</link>
    <description>Also recently had a problem with people logging in with names longer than you can type so for mods and admins unbannable if they misbehave.

Does anybody know if it would be possible and if so how to go about setting the server to ban an account  if the username is greater than 12 characters long? I removed the file that allows you to do this but people keep adding it back in so i dont see any other option.</description>
