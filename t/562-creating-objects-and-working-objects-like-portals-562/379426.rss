    <title>[562] Creating Objects, and working Objects Like Portals [562]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-creating-objects-and-working-objects-like-portals-562/379426</link>
    <description>***This is my first tutorial.***

In this tutorial I will cover placing new objects, and creating working objects like portals.


Part 1- Creating new objects in a 562 Server.

To locate the file: go into the src folder, then com&gt;rs2hd&gt;net and open the ActionSender.java.
The action sender is where you can call up and place new objects.

In the ActionSender.java search for the following:
[code]player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject[/code]

This is where, and how you add new objects. 
The following is an example that I will explain:

[code]player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject(2274, 0, 2691, 3487, -1, 10);//Portal to rock crabs[/code]

The player.getActionSender().sendCreateObject calls up the create object function. The first number (2274) is the item ID (a portal). The second number (0) I believe is the Z axis, or the level of the object. The third (2691) and fourth (3487) are the X and Y coordinates. The fifth number (-1) is the direction of the object. 0 is south, 2 is north, I don&#39;t know any others yet. The last number (10) I&#39;m not sure what it is. It seems that 10 is appropriate for every object I&#39;ve placed. It may be scale or the size of the object. I&#39;m not sure.  

Simply find your coordinates, the item you want and create it. It&#39;s that simple. Save, compile and restart your server.

 Part 2- Creating a working object: portal.

First you have to place the portal. Follow part one to do this. 

Once you have created the portal navigate to: src&gt;com&gt;rs2hd&gt;packethandler&gt;Object1PacketHandler.java
Open this file, and scroll down a bit till you get into the case area. It looks like this:

[code]case 16043: // exit to second stage
			if (!player.getInventory().contains(989)){
				player.sm(&quot;You need the right key to go through this.&quot;);
				return;
			}
			player.tele(2205 , 4959, 0);
			player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=0099cc&gt;&lt;img=1&gt;WELCOME TO THE END&lt;img=1&gt;.&quot;);
			player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=0099cc&gt;&lt;img=1&gt;KILL THESE MONSTERS FOR AMAZING DROPS&lt;img=1&gt;.&quot;);
			player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=0099cc&gt;&lt;img=1&gt;GOOD LUCK!&lt;img=1&gt;.&quot;);
			break;
		case 29534: // start of members dungeon		
			if (player.member == 1) {
				player.tele(2647 , 9394, 0);
				player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=0099cc&gt;&lt;img=1&gt;Welcome to the first STAGE!&lt;img=1&gt;.&quot;);
				player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=0099cc&gt;&lt;img=1&gt;Kill the creatures and find a bone key!&lt;img=1&gt;.&quot;);
				player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;&lt;col=0099cc&gt;&lt;img=1&gt;Then go through the tunnel!&lt;img=1&gt;.&quot;);
				return;
			}
			player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;You need to be a member to use this portal&quot;);
			break;
		case 2273: //Barrows portal		
			if (player.member == 1) {
				player.tele(3566 , 3306, 0);
				player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to borrows! This is dangerous. Be careful!&quot;);
				return;
			}
			if (player.member == 0) {
				player.tele(3566 , 3306, 0);
				player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to borrows! This is dangerous. Be careful!&quot;);
				}
			break;[/code]
It won&#39;t look exactly the same but anywhere will work. 
We will start by creating a new case.
A case tells the server what an object, which we placed, is to do.
A case consists of the following:
[code]case ##item ID##: //description (optional)
     if DoSomethingFunction (parameters) {
     What to do if the parameters are met.;
    return;
    }
      what.to.do.if.parameters.aren&#39;t.met;
break; [/code]

Start with setting your item ID for the case. We will use the portal we created in part one.
[code]
case 2274:[/code]

Once you have that you need to decide what you want the portal to do. We will have it teleport us to the Rock Crabs in Fremmy and send the message &quot;Welcome to the Rock Crabs!&quot; to the player.

Start with the if statement.

[code]case 2274:
     if (player.member==1) {

}
     if(player.member==0) {

}[/code]
This is so we can decide how we want the portal to react to members and non members.
I want the portal to work for both members and non members so the functions will be identical.
Lets add some commands to the function to make the player teleport and receive a message.

[code]case 2274:
     if (player.member==1) {
            player.tele(2699 , 3718, 0);
	    player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to the Rock Crabs!&quot;);
	 return;
}
     if(player.member==0) {
            player.tele(2699 , 3718, 0);
	    player.getActionSender().sendMessage(&quot;Welcome to the Rock Crabs!&quot;);
				
}
break;
[/code]

The player.tele() tells the server that the portal is going to move the player to a different location. The three number in order from left to right are the X(2699) Y(3718) and Z(0) coordinates. The player.getActionSender().sendMessage() tells the server to send the player a string or &quot;message&quot; when the portal is activated. Make sure you put your message in quotes or it will treat the message as variables and they will throw errors during the compile. Also don&#39;t forget the &quot;break; at the end of the case. This simply tells the server that this is where the case ends. 

Save, compile, and restart your server. You now have a portal at the Catherbery pub that teleports you to rock crabs on click. 

I hope I&#39;ve helped someone. Like I said, this is my first tutorial. Let me know what I need to do to make it better.</description>
