    <title>Clip Fix (377)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/clip-fix-377/382783</link>
    <description>I&#39;m not looking for a particular &quot;Source&quot; that has a 100% perfect npc clip fix, I am just looking for a 377 clip fix, I have the 317 clip, but there is stuff like mainly Pest Controll that is not fixed, my Npc&#39;s can just walk through the walls, and instead of going through and setting each individual block not walkable I want to set it for my whole map. Does anyone have the 377 clipping information. I&#39;m not asking for a spoon feed, I am still looking myself.</description>
