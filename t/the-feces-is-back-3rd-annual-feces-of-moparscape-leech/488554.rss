    <description>[b][size=24pt]WELCOME TO THE THIRD ANNUAL FECES OF MOPARSCAPE THREAD[/size][/b]
YEP

Now, before I start this off, I&#39;m going to start with a few notes

The following you are about to see should be taken in any way personally, if you are portrayed as an fatass no life emo vagina, you should probably the message that you should kill yourself, and as another example if you are portrayed as a 5&#39;4 ripped mopar mod, then you should get the message that you have a big dick and will be successful in life
Not using pictures from previous Feces topics, starting from scratch this year!
Don&#39;t spam m8s I don&#39;t want genius thread to get locked again
ALSO MY 7000TH POST
And now..
Without any further ado
[size=18pt]MOPARSCAPE
I
GIVE YOU
FECES[/size]NOW FOR THE NEW AND IMPROVED FECES, MORE COMING TOO!!!

<p>I sir, am the original creator of ‘Feces of Mopar’ I demand you:</p>
<ul>
<li>take this shit down</li>
</ul>
<p>OR abide by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the quality of the drawings. Your Feces of Moparscape is no where near the awesome of the original Feces of Mopar</li>
<li>If its going to be ANNUAL then hold it on the same day. IE the original day it was created. April 17!!!</li>
<li>Smush all the images into one super massive annoying to load image.</li>
<li>Each member portrayed int he image must interact with AT LEAST one other member in some obscene, sexual or death, or bad for health way.</li>
</ul>
<p>ARE YOU COLOUR BLIND? WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DISPLAY MANY MANY COLOURS. WHY DO YOU INSIST ON LIVING 300 MILLION YEARS AGO WHEN CAVE MEN DREW ON WALLS WITH THEIR SHIT(BROWN), THEIR BLOOD(RED) AND THE BLOOD OF THE WELL KNOWN FAGGOTSAUR WITH GREEN SEXUAL JUICES. YOU HAVE FAILED THE FECES.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Below is a small list of [size=18pt]issues[/size] I have with this feces comic.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Look at Bowser Jr’s flag, why is it some psuedo American flag… You have 50 “States” in your terrible country, I know you can only count to four but come on…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cole1497 has an abnormally large penis, He is not a whale, he is not a horse, he is definitely not an elephant. He is a teenage boy that is most likely a virgin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Krackkid’s fire extinguisher does not have a safety pin… You must ammend this to conform to safety regulations…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amy Webb’s lips are too close to her eye, In my native country of North Korea this is insult to leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fuscate does not put Shrimps on Barbies, Barbie’s are incapable of getting hot, I would suggesting putting the Shrimp on an Action Man doll, much more effective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lin does not have diamonds on his arse, he stuck them right into his arsehole, they are not visible to the naked eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frell has no swag, only thing that has swag:<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/2wtjs.jpg" alt width="650" height="435"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pure2Ownage is not holding a nine, he seems to be holding a poorly drawn mint leaf pulled straight from the grounds of Edgware and a wooden bracket house supporting frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reyx7 did not mention <span class="hashtag">#420</span> <span class="hashtag">#blaze</span> <span class="hashtag">#it</span> <span class="hashtag">#faggot</span> <span class="hashtag">#yolo</span> therefore you are guilty of libel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i vain i has not had reconstructive surgery to extend his mouth beyond his face, therefore the image is not truly representing himself and his lawyer will contact you shortly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tree’s do not talk, Only those that have smoked too many trees can believe in such propostrous things. Who the love puts a star on the top of their Christmas Tree anyway, you should put the Angel of the North up there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vault AKA DAVID cannot aquire Semen in a bag, Semen should only be found in Condoms and sperm donation banks, RS GP cannot be traded for Sperm since the exchange rate does not lie on the Real number line. Current 5ml of Sperm (One table spoon) = 5623i gp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ry600003333333 Penis is longer than his Nose, Jews have longer Noses than Penises, your representation is therefore highly inaccurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miss Silabsoft does not a blue partyhat with the value of 900k. I mean 900k what? 900k penis holes? 900k faggots, 900k Rick Astleys?! 900k letter k’s?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why the love is pampeniso draw as an asian penis. Peniso translated from Oriental Kuwaitian is a type of dog breed. In now way does a dog resemble a penis, unless you have mental issues, but even in that case you are not excused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spades cannot have an “anti ddoassz shield”. Any senior representative of The Internet would inform you that such shields only block traffic coming from Pathetic 3rd World Countries like America. DDoassz coming from the might North Korea is unstopable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>c`p must be drawn with an abnormally large penis covered with cheese and a Police Siren on his forehead. This is written in the North Korean Declaration of Independance Of Hatred Towards America.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speljohan does not have Swastikas hovering below his arms, they hover above him like a Halo. The blasphemy you write above him will result in yourself being smited by the higher powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stork must have more cocaine near his nostrils as well as several “bitches” hanging off his arms (which are not big enough). Add a few herons maybe as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jme does not have 420 in his name, It’s <span class="hashtag">#Four-Twenty</span> <span class="hashtag">#yolo</span> <span class="hashtag">#blaze</span> it. He also smokes Weed, not have it hovering close to him, I mean who the love would leave weed just lying around when you could smoke it…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Niall is not that skinny. They say that the camera puts 20lb onto people, you seems to reduce Niall’s weight by 2000lb… You must rectify this now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is super_ saying the “equation” “2x + 2 = 2x = 0”, That is not mathematically correct as x cannot take two values at the same time and still keep the equality tight. In addition, you seem to have defined a mathe function called “loge”, although you may be trying to take the natural logarithm of the constant e, the lack of parentheses really make this bad. “African” is not a standard mathematical constant as “African” is worthless, you have not defined it yourself therefore this is all wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bootnecklad??? IS THIS MEANT TO BE ME?! why am I standing next to a giant LCD monitor with some primitive OS being shown. Titan OS is lightyears ahead of the graphics you have portrayed. Your attempts at an online list is extremely confusing… I do not recall any user being called “online”… Bowser good american??? what does that mean? good and american cannot feature in same sentance ever (Pyongyang Constitutational Rights Act 2014 Chp 4, Pg 53, Ln 42)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is T4 questioning himself, why would he do such a thing, he is a confident black heron that don’t need no man, he would never doubt himself like that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wackatre cannot say HUE HUE, that is only reserved for clever peoople such as myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greeny does not look like that… I mean wtf that is just blasphemous… holy shit if his mother was here right now today you’d recieve several lashings. This is how Greeny should look like:<br>
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/bX3vWas.png" alt width="640" height="480"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruby is not Red, The Gem Ruby may appear “Red” but Ruby is not a Gem, he is a human being, you have been terribly misinformed. You should validate your resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>siAfrican has more than three teeth visible. Adults have 32 teeth while children have 20, even babies have teeth…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JC(NUMBERS) does not have SWAG, refer to the pigeon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stupit is stupit, you have not emphasised this enough therefore are criminally respsonsible for anything he does within the hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Erlang cannot be inserted into Jmood, this is not possible as they are both male and their rear ends have been sealed. Putting it in the mouth does not count as sexual intercourse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natey has two legs, One of his legs seem to be disjointed from his body, this is not accurate and may result in yourself being whipped by our almighty leader Steve Jong Un Jobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>coonhunter appears to have no legs attached to his body, refer to the above point about punishements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>classic is not a terrorist, he is just a faggot. He also does not own a “Classic RANGEROVER”. Unlike me. But he should.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Svitkona is a good terrorist, he does not strap TNT to the outside of his body for eveyrone to see, he does it underneath his clothes. And I mean wtf why is his TNT transparent, I mean that’s not physically possibly even when you’ve used the Tardis… which of course I have, I am bootnecklad and I have access to thse things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newty’s penis seems to be deformed, you should be notified that he does not have a penis and his eyes are not red… I mean nobody put the flash on, so no red eye. And even if flash was on, moparscpe red removal tool would have removed this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is The Soul holding a pet dragon/cat in his hands with a square tail, that makes no sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fat Cookies is not a round circle. Have you ever seen a white cookie with nothing on it? No… thought so… you must rectify this with the real Fat_Cookies. He is my lover. My one true wife. I am deeply offended by this. I wish death upon you and your country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silent CJ cannot be Silent since he would be a disfunctional member of society if he was. I know he contribute to society because he work hard Jong Un’s Cardboard Sweater Factory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evil_ is mining, but WHERE IS HIS PICKAXE? Are you stupid, you can’t punch stone in real life… It hurts your hands…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tico, Mod? Wut</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You make me sick. filthy loveing faggot flat face asian girl with lovely mustard walls axually u wot are you retarded irl jesus love donkey love ring those faggots</p>
