    <title>Cache download help?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cache-download-help/63794</link>
    <description>well first i tried getting the cache through the mopar client itself about 20 times didn&#39;t work...
then i tried to get it by manual downloading it didn&#39;t work.

it keeps disconnecting me from the server. i got as far as 40% then disconnected from the server.

so could someone plz download the cache.zip. Rar zip it then upload it so i can download it from a normal download instead of it going to my temporary Internet files....? and if you can thanks it will be appreciated.
