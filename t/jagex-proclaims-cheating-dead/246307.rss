    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagex-proclaims-cheating-dead/246307</link>
    <description>I was looking at various stream ciphers a moment ago when I spotted a familiar friend, ISAAC. Through a convoluted and Wikipedia-mediated chain of links, I came to this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Random events:

We had planned some work on the random events of RuneScape quite some time ago. We were looking to see if we could remove most of them, because a decent number were not particularly good at stopping modern-day bots. [b]Since the threat of bots and macros has been largely removed, we feel that this is a perfect opportunity to address the problem again.[/b] For the moment, we are concentrating on our PvP minigames to compensate for the Wilderness changes, but the random event proposal has been approved and is in the pipeline.

NOTE - We are certainly not removing every single random event. This proposal gives us the chance to reassess them, see if they are doing their job properly and then take action: removing those that do not work, adding to those that do and improving the rewards of all that remain!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reading the boards over the last few months, I&#39;ve gotten the impression that a least several of you have functional bot systems, even if information about them is not forthcoming here. So what&#39;s going on in cheating? I seem to be quite out of the loop with current developments.</description>

<p>clearly you’re not going to get 100% of your userbase contributing and if you think you will then you’re nieve.</p>
<p>but perhaps 15% of people helping is much better then 0% helping.</p>
<p>although i agree that open source in runescape bots is different to open source in real life.</p>

<p>That was the advantage I had in mind. That’s the only prevalent pro I can think of for open source. If you look at any open source projects in general, they seem to be better than proprietary. Such as Firefox, Pidgin, OpenOffice, 7-Zip, etc etc.</p>

<p>I feel the argument of open source is better than proprietary software is objective but I guess everyone has their own opinion.</p>

well, maybe against nexus, dont know how it gets the image<br>
[/quote]assuming ruler is still doing it how i told him to, it gets the int array that is used as a pixel buffer[/quote]<br>
'fraid not,</p>
<p>ruler creates his own “java.awt.Canvas” and modifies it to write to his image,<br>
he then uses -Xbootclasspath to force the VM to prioritize his class usage over the default packaged one.</p>
<p>i haven’t looked at rscheating for a while now, i feel outdated! last time i properly looked would be when Speljohan released my <em>shitty</em> updater, which then became public, which saw the release of many “Home-Brewed” ares bots!</p>
<p>RSBot was/is an adaptation of aresbot, as much as Speljohan disagrees, it is true.</p>
<p>Edit:<br>
oh, a bird flew past and said “Autorune”, maybe just a co-incidence <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>

</aside>
<p>i understand the client now has some canvas native peer swapping thingy, so Benland’s SMART stops working after 10 minuites or so.<br>
i can think of a good fix, but since SMART is closed source, and Benland is too busy to fix it, i dont think anyone has been using it for a few weeks now.</p>
<p>if scar isnt a proper cheat, why did jagex do this? (well, maybe against nexus, dont know how it gets the image)</p>
<p>MWAHAHAHA SRL PAYS THE PRICE FOR ITS CLOSED SOURCE, now i can walk around saying “I told you so”</p>

Sounds interesting.[/quote]<a href="http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,198529.msg1770644.html#msg1770644" rel="nofollow noopener">http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,198529.msg1770644.html#msg1770644</a> was a graphical example of how one may use the AST for deobfuscating, it was about that time i grew disgusted with attempting to regex the instructions (i laughed when i saw the date of that thread… i didnt end up liking soot because the documentation is terrible and it seems rather bloated, multiple passes doing the same thing for different IRs didnt really appeal to me, especially when the dataflow analysis of the clientscript parsing methods takes several minutes)</p>
<p>even though some transformations are easy/nice enough to perform by iterating the instruction list, they would be nicer still if implemented as some sort of AST visitor*</p>
<p>i havent really thought out the feature vectors for classes/fields/methods. as an example for classes i was thinking of having the depth in the hierarchy tree, number of interfaces, number of member fields/methods/constructors and number of subclasses. i cannot see any immediate problems and may even have enough implemented to try it out now</p>
<p>i currently plan to just identify <span class="bbcode-i">things</span> from one version to the next, i will probably attach mnemonics later</p>
<p>*an example:</p>
<p>[code]public final class ShiftFixer implements MethodTransformer {<br>
private static AbstractInsnNode makePush(int val) {<br>
if (val &lt;= 5 &amp;&amp; val &gt;= 0) {<br>
return new InsnNode(Opcodes.ICONST_0 + val);<br>
} else {<br>
return new IntInsnNode(Opcodes.BIPUSH, val);<br>
}<br>
}</p>
<pre><code>public MethodNode transform(String owner, MethodNode mn) {
    ListIterator&lt;AbstractInsnNode&gt; i = mn.instructions.iterator(mn.instructions.size());
    while (i.hasPrevious()) {
        AbstractInsnNode insn = i.previous();
        int op = insn.getOpcode();
        if (op &gt;= Opcodes.ISHL &amp;&amp; op &lt;= Opcodes.LUSHR) {
            AbstractInsnNode prev = insn.getPrevious();
            if (prev.getType() == AbstractInsnNode.LDC_INSN) {
                i.set(makePush(((Integer) ((LdcInsnNode) prev).cst) &amp; ((op &amp; 1) == 0 ? 31 : 63)));
            }
        }
    }
    return mn;
}
</code></pre>
<p>}[/code]</p>
<p>could be</p>
<p><code>
public final class ShiftFixer extends ASTVisitorAdapter {
    public void visitShiftExpr(ShiftExpr ex) {
        if (ex.left().expr_type() == Expr.CONSTANT) {
            int i = ((ConstExpr) ex.left()).value();
            ex.set_left(new Constant(i &amp; (ex.type() == Type.LONG ? 63 : 31)));
        }
    }
}</code></p>

Pretty much like aryan but with interfaces because we don’t compile against the client.</p>
<p>There is still ruler’s bot if you call a colour clicker a bot.</p>
