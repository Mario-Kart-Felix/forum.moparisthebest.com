    <description>Lock if you wish.

[center][size=20pt][b]Making A Player Owned Property![/b][/size][/center]

[b]I&#39;ve had the idea in my head for quite awhile, and I&#39;ve become quite bored and want to finish the idea that I started. There is still some coding that I will need help with, and I am looking for java coders to help me out. Any help whatsoever is appreciated.[/b]
[hr]
[center][size=20pt][b]What Is A Player Owned Property?[/b][/size][/center]

[b]A Player Owned Property (or POP), is pretty much like RuneScape&#39;s Player Owned Houses, but its a little more simpler than having to create a whole new area that grows as your level up the skill more. I plan to make POP&#39;s on already-created areas. The reason why I don&#39;t just make it a Player Owned House (or POH), is because I don&#39;t want players to be limited to creating JUST a house. I want it to be a little larger, like allowing players to buy other peoples houses, letting players own their own shops (and when someone buys something from their shop, the owners get money), ect. But the thing is, I only know a little bit on how to do this, and I want as much help as I can get![/b]
[hr]
[center][size=20pt][b]How Can YOU Help?[/b][/size][/center]

[b]To be honest, you can help in even the littlest ways. Like giving me a little strip of coding to work on, helping fix a few errors, correcting any misspelling. Really, anything will do.[/b]
[hr]
[center][size=20pt][b]Contact Me![/b][/size][/center]

[b]The Following is a list of ways to contact me-
[b]PM Me Either On MSCP ([url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=pm;sa=send;u=133637]http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=pm;sa=send;u=133637[/url]), or MITB ([url=http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=pm;sa=send;u=133637]http://moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?action=pm;sa=send;u=133637[/url])[/b]
[b]Email/Add Me At-
[email]helboundz@yahoo.com[/email][/b]

[center][b][size=25pt]REMEMBER!!! EVEN THE SMALLEST HELP WILL COUNT!!!![/size][/b][/center]
[b]Please Do Not Steal My Idea. POP is completely my idea.[/b]</description>

              <pre><code> It has been a year and somewhat since I last worked on this project. Development ceased long ago, during the time I went exploring the web for other things to entice myself and indulge in. POP ( Player Owned Property. ) was one of two ' major ' projects I was working on for some time, the other of which I finished earlier on and is completely irrelevant to the POP, but did not release on account I quit programming in Java for some time to study other programming languages of interest to me. I will not be releasing the aforementioned project until I so wish, but the general idea was to make a unique ' Handler ' of sorts. POP may never be released, as it is only in about 40% completion. 

 POP will be released at a later time if I wish, wherein the same rules apply with the ' Handler ' project. This is the closing post of this thread. Moderators may lock this thread now.

Let me get this straight, you want people to own parts of land and already built houses?</p>
<p>PS: Programing != Coding<br>
[/quote] No, lol. The ‘houses’, so to speak, ARE the land. The ‘houses’ are just buildings thats purpose you select from a list that the server will give you. You are only allowed to create one building, but you can buy/co-own other buildings. Like if you bought a shop, the previous owner will lose all rights to the shop, and will not get any money if someone buys something from the shop, whereas the new owner will have all the rights, and get the money. If you co-own a shop, the rights are given to both owners, and the money earned is split in 50/50, each half given to one of the owners. The ‘shop’ I used to explain the above is only one of the many features I wish to add to the Player Owned Property. Also, please understand that this is still an idea, and POP will contain more things than what are posted here. The list of features I posted is only some of the features I wish to add.[/quote]<br>
Wouldn’t this consist of thousands of variables for the houses? I mean if everyone gets an assigned house, they will need to have a menu telling them the cords then the cords at the bottom right for them to know. I suggest talking karmja and making it into like an island of houses, with thousands. I can make a menu providing info on there new houses</p>
<p>some thing in the menu sections</p>
<p>}<br>
Menu = Show new house;<br>
{<br>
Coordinates = +coordinate assigned house;</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">I’ve had the idea in my head for quite awhile, and I’ve become quite bored and want to finish the idea that I started. There is still some coding that I will need help with, and I am looking for java coders to help me out. Any help whatsoever is appreciated.</span><br>

[center][size=20pt]<span class="bbcode-b">What Is A Player Owned Property?</span>[/size][/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">A Player Owned Property (or POP), is pretty much like RuneScape’s Player Owned Houses, but its a little more simpler than having to create a whole new area that grows as your level up the skill more. I plan to make POP’s on already-created areas. The reason why I don’t just make it a Player Owned House (or POH), is because I don’t want players to be limited to creating JUST a house. I want it to be a little larger, like allowing players to buy other peoples houses, letting players own their own shops (and when someone buys something from their shop, the owners get money), ect. But the thing is, I only know a little bit on how to do this, and I want as much help as I can get!</span><br>

It was Jagex’s idea. Even if you argue and say POH was their own, it’s still the same idea.<br>
It cannot be completely your idea, since I have been working on it since 2 months ago, and you need to fix your client up for it too. =-)<br>
You cannot copyright anything in your private server, because anything that goes into it is property of Jagex, even if you design it yourself. If I wanted to, I could claim POP too, but I wont since I am not a leecher. I am just saying, that anyone can call it POP and anyone can use it the same way you do, since you don’t really “own” your server files. They may be in your computer, but they are still property of Jagex Ltd.</p>

<p>So? Just because you want to make something, that doesn’t mean that no-one else is allowed to make it.[/quote]I don’t mean it exactly like that! I am asking that you don’t steal my exact Idea. As I am the one who thought of POP (POP! Not POH, or any RS PS version of POH. POP is just mine). If someone does not take my ideas on POP, but are still making a private server version of RS2’s POH, then I am fine with that. But POP (Including the name) is mine, and solely mine. It will not use any thing from any version of POH. Meaning like any of the exact furniture from it (POP will have furniture though), any of the exact designs from it, or any of the exact mechanics of it.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: December 27, 2007, 02:47:47 PM[/size][hr]sooo… any good ideas?</p>

<p>It CAN be done, I wont bother going into details, but you CAN make a private area, create tiles using client editing, and well the 377 cache has the cons obj.</p>
<p>so gud luk[/quote]Seriously? I thought I was the first one. I know its not that hard of a thing to think of, but I never saw any threads about it, so I just thought that no one had ever thought about it yet, and that I was the first one. And to be honest, it is proving to be a hard code to create. But the longer it takes to make it, the greater chances it will have for success and less bugs.</p>
<p>And plus, I waited for a more advanced client/server engineering generation so that the possibility of a private server version of RS2’s POH. With all these server’s updating to MySQL for a greater RS PS experience, and a faster cache development in private servers(caused by SilabSoft mainly), the ability to create a RS PS version of RS2’s POH is not that far out of grasp. If the RS2 PS community keeps on advancing as fast as I think it will, the POP system should speeden in development. I do not know for sure when the POP will be released, but I expect it to atleast be 60% complete by the summer of 08. I do know one thing though, and that is that a thing closer to this has been done before. Xero-(idk if it was XeroFreeze or XeroCheeze) created a POC (Player-Owned-City) system I think a year or two ago. He released it to rune-server with the download link, but closed the download link not too long after, seeing that he could make a profit by selling his POC. I plan to make POP open source, and also for it to keep up-to-date with private server’s and their clients.</p>
<p>I expect that POP will have its own client, seeing as it most likely will have an edited cache, for some things I might add. POP will also be kind of like Pest Control probably. What I mean is that it will need its own client that is compatible with POP, like with client-side coding, like how Clan Chat is.</p>
