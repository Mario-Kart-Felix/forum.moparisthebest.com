    <title>Need partner [Co-owner]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-partner-co-owner/453004</link>
    <description>I am looking for a co owner to my server.
It&#39;s InsidiaX source. I am not really good at coding, but I know the basics. I got money enough to pay for vps and a domain. I am 100 percent serious about the server, I am spending a lot of time trying to make it better. If anyone would like to join me as a partner.
I am looking for a partner who got experience with coding and such. My partner doesn&#39;t need to help me pay for the server, but some help wouldn&#39;t hurt. 

It&#39;s an economy/pvp based server. 

Add me at skype: David.birkelund</description>
