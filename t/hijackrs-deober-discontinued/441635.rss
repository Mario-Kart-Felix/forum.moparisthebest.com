    <title>HijackRS Deober (Discontinued)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hijackrs-deober-discontinued/441635</link>
    <description>I haven&#39;t been doing much RS related stuff for the past few months due to the fact that I&#39;ve gotten into WoW.

As some of you might remember I was working on this as a project for quite some time, but seeing as it&#39;s not being worked on anymore and just sitting on my computer I decided to upload it, maybe someone can work on it or take from it or whatever.

I think it broke around 704 or 705 and then I quit working on it because I got into other things. I just tested and it fails on 30 or so classes on current RS client.

It was never able to produce compilable deobs but it came close, the only things that need fixing (probably complete rewrite) is the exception optimization code.

Features:

Full linux/windows support
17 code modifiers
Decompiles with fernflower/jode
Other stuff that I can&#39;t quite remember

There were some people who helped out with some code, and if they did their names are in the author tags of the certain classes they helped with or allowed me to refer to their code.

Without further ado, the project files.
