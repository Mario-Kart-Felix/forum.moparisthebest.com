    <title>I need your ban appeals</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-need-your-ban-appeals/60161</link>
    <description>Hi guys, over the past few days I&#39;v been re-making an old project of mine, a website containing an archive of submitted ban appeals to Jagex and I need some ideas for appeals, or ones you&#39;ve previously sent in.

I&#39;m looking for serious appeals that could get an account unbanned and funny appeals which (I&#39;m guessing) will be the main attraction of the site.

Funny appeals will be submitted to Jagex from my &quot;No hope of being unbanned&quot; accounts (eg. Level 3 accounts with 90 mining that stayed online regulary for 100 hours straight) or banned accounts users have submitted.

I&#39;m also in need of any throw-away accounts that have been banned for various reasons (I&#39;v only got banned accounts for macroing) and haven&#39;t previously sent in appeals to test some of the different serious appeals. Chances are most of them won&#39;t be unbanned which is why I don&#39;t want your level 100 account that was banned for swearing.

A few things to remember:
- You can swear. Nothing on the site will be censored.
- Be original, google is swarming with appeals that all sound the same. &quot;I&#39;ll sue you&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll commit suiside&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I won&#39;t do it again&quot; ect.
- All appeals must be 400 characters, including spaces, or less (This is the limit set by Jagex for an appeal)
- If (in the unlikely event) any appeal is accepted from an account submitted you will recieve your account back untouched.

Look forward to seeing how creative this community can be ;)

-Note: I have already found a few appeals in this forum which have been posted on the website, credits to the author and a link back to the original page are displayed within the appeal and an additional link back to moparisthebest.com has been added to my links page.

              <p>Hello, Jagex Thanks for the last appeal! I’m almost 99% sure you won’t unban<br>
me but why not take a chance? Anyways yes I did deserve the ban… Well Ive recently made a new account or two with no black marks or mutes or anything. But having [acc name here] back would be great. I can’t exactly say much more but I changed alot. But if you don’t unban me I would like to say again, I’m sorry for what I did.<br>
