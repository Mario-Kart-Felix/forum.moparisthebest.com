    <title>Need help with my gladiator skill</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-my-gladiator-skill/87848</link>
    <description>Alright, I&#39;m in the process of making a gladiator skill. I&#39;ve done some research and made armour sets according to the different names and armours the gladiators wore. I&#39;ve added the item masks. I&#39;ve added an event where a certain amount of gladiators will be chosen to fight. 

Now all I want to know is how I can:
[b]1:[/b]
[i]Make it so for every gladiator kill, you get a certain amount of experience or in this case [b]reputation[/b] points, and also getting a certain amnount of points depending on the reputation of your opponent (another human player). [/i]

[b]2:[/b]
[i]I need to make it so that when the players get chosen to fight, they automatically wear their armour and can&#39;t change it - and they can&#39;t eat food either[/i]

[b]3:[/b]
[i]I would like to make a certain weapon snare the opponent without using a spell. The snare I&#39;m planning should hit randomly but happens once to every person the player hits - from here, the player who gets snared gets dealt a random amount of damage above 10.[/i]

[b]4:[/b]
[i]To make it so you need to be a certain gladiator lvl to wear the armour [b]sets[/b] and when you go into battle you see an interface come up with choosing your armour set and you can&#39;t mix around the armour sets either.[/i]

[b]I would appreciate help - although I need someone who has a lot of Java knowledge and is willing to help me. If you could, could you PM me if you can help and also PM me with your ideas. Just so no one else takes them[/b]

[i]Thanks - I know this is a lot to ask[/i]</description>
