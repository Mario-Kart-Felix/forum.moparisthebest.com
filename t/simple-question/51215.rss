    <title>Simple Question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-question/51215</link>
    <description>Alright, ive updated Java and other stuff and i can log into Moparscape, okay?  About 30min ago i cant get on ANY server, Hamachi based or not.  The only one i can get on is the default server where u play alone.  Does anyone know what I could do to fix the problem?  My problem is whenever i log in it says server is down, and its not down bc the owner says its online on forums, ive checked so many servers, ALL down.  Please help, thanks.
