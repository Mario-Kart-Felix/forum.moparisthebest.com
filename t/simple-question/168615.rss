    <title>Simple question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/simple-question/168615</link>
    <description>first off. i would like to clear that i am new to mopar forums slightly...i that i have downloaded the client and server moparscape as a source 2 weeks ago and i have been working on my own version of it for download calledTrivscape.  So far my starting point is my working pest control area.  Teleports line up in every town and i have not left any town untouched both with monsters...training and npcs etc....i even have a wild with 95 levels(no telporting after 50) and duel arenas along with 100 percent working skills besides firemaking which is a tad off.   think the server isunique in my mind in that it is mostly created myself with the exception of the moparscape source which has allowed me to add various things in....i also have a 50% working sairs now which when you go up it you wont float around and walk around in the air and also you can put stuff in there with a room visible at 50%.....need help on that...[b]but my main question is concerning the changes in experience gained per every hit with any weapon with any monster, withany npc.  I currently only want double the rs2 normal exp gained  I also would like to know how to change how many items the npcs and monsters drop when eiter killed or given an item.  [/b]</description>
