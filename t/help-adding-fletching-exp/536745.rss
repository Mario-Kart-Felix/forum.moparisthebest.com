    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-adding-fletching-exp/536745</link>
    <description>im trying to fix my skills, I have my fletching worked out but when i fletch the logs it dosnt give me xp, i can only fletch arrow shafts atm and they dont give xp. Its really basic i know but where exactly Would i add the xp and how Because theres so many options with fletching.

Ive tried c.getPA().addSkillXP((ITEM_ON_ITEM[j][3] * xp) * FLETCHING_XP, c.playerFletching); and manouvering that didnt even work. Can somene please help?</description>

Your best try would be to add it after the items are made. So the logs get deleted and the arrow shafts replace it. I think that would be your best option.</p>
