              <p>There is currently 347+ pages and counting. Are you willing to go through each threads + user posts and give us each thread that needs “taking down”?</p>
<p>I’m 100% certain if you can do that, you would also be able take action on each thread after a very sad person as double checked each one.</p>
<p>If you’re smart enough maybe you can make a script to save the trouble but I’m sure if you could do that you would “maybe” not be leech from the download section but fact that you are <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

              <p>That would take far too much time for mods, a waste of time really. Next time, before reading all of the topic, check the links first and if they work continue on reading. It is the simplest solution for everyone, and it really isn’t that much effort to achieve your end result.</p>
