    <description>I hate it. &#39;Talk about Neopets&#39; is pretty much a useless forum to me. I just made this topic because &#39;fake rich[b]n[/b]ess&#39; was irritating when I looked at it. Who actually likes Neopets? It seems like just something to add posts to this forum&#39;s post count. I think the best course of action would be to make this category,  a sub-category of General Gaming. Or to just merge this with General Gaming.

Edit: Actually, I don&#39;t know much about Neopets, what is it about? Do you download a client to play? What is the object of the game? To get rich?</description>
