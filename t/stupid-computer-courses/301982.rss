    <title>Stupid Computer Courses</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stupid-computer-courses/301982</link>
    <description>I signed up for Computer Studies this year to take a look at how my highschool is with computers etc.

What I found, aggravated me a lot.

1. The teacher doesn&#39;t have a clue.  He really doesn&#39;t.  He understand basic programming concepts, but he doesn&#39;t know what IDE stands for and he thinks Visual Basic (not .NET) is completely object oriented etc etc.  It pisses me off a lot but I do not like challenging teachers as it never ends well for me.

2. From grades 10-12 the only language they teach is Visual Basic.  Enough said.

I&#39;m not sure what to do, taking it to grade 12 might look nice on an application to a post-secondary school since I plan on working in the computer programming field.

However, the classes make me rip the hair from my skull, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s worth sticking with.


Have any of you guys had an experience like myself?  How did you handle it?

What should I do?</description>

<p>I’m unsure in what is included in Year 11 &amp; 12 IT Programming since I am in Year 10. I guess the teachers are OK and have a good idea of what they are doing at my school although they do get lost in some areas.</p>

<p>I can beat it, back in high school our teacher was complaining about spy-ware on her computer.  My friend and I told her to install adaware (the best there was at the time) to remove it, she installed it, then came back to school the next day and yelled at us a lot saying she did research and discovered that ad-ware was bad and the same as spy-ware.  We explained to her that the program was adaware and not ad-ware, that it removed ad-ware, but she still didn’t believe us and stayed angry. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>If I were you I’d just skip the programming courses in high school, none were offered at my high school and I still got into college just fine.  My brother has taken 2 in high school and it’s like yours, VB6 is what they use and it is useless.[/quote]Well, it is too late to drop the course now.  I am just going to have to hold out for the rest of the year and see how it goes.</p>

              <p>[quote=“the bank, post:1, topic:301982”]I signed up for Computer Studies this year to take a look at how my highschool is with computers etc.</p>
<p>What I found, aggravated me a lot.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The teacher doesn’t have a clue.  He really doesn’t.  He understand basic programming concepts, but he doesn’t know what IDE stands for and he thinks Visual Basic (not .NET) is completely object oriented etc etc.  It pisses me off a lot but I do not like challenging teachers as it never ends well for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From grades 10-12 the only language they teach is Visual Basic.  Enough said.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not sure what to do, taking it to grade 12 might look nice on an application to a post-secondary school since I plan on working in the computer programming field.</p>
<p>(By the way if the class is easy, and you ace it, it’ll be better for you. Especially if you can jump 1 year ahead)</p>
<p>However, the classes make me rip the hair from my skull, and I’m not sure if it’s worth sticking with.</p>
<p>Have any of you guys had an experience like myself?  How did you handle it?</p>
<p>What should I do?[/quote]<br>
Yeah well so far I’m taking a computer engineer class and in 2weeks of school we’ve done 1 power point. Well just take the best classes for computers that you can. You should stick with it until the end of it because it will look bad ass (in a good way) on your application. And if you take private lessons it’s even better if you can get it on there</p>
