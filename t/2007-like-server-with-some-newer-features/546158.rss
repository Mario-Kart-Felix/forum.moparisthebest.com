    <description>My name is Ryan and I&#39;m looking for help with developing a 2007 based server with some newer and custom items. 
I have implemented a lot so far such as...
-Fletching
-Smithing
-Mining
-Runecrafting
-Woodcutting
-Crafting
-Firemaking
-Farming
-Herb
-Agility
-Thieving
-Fishing
-Cooking
-Slayer
-Great combat (range, melee, mage)
-Prayer
(fero (5) ring added)

-Pest control
-Barrows
-Fight pits
-Tokkul minigame
-Mage arena minigame
-tzaar fight pits
-63 waves of jad
-Duel Arena
-Daggs
-KBD
-Godwars
-Chaos ele
MUCH MORE!

A strong focus around the economy, players get dbones sell them for cash or use them for prayer. A membership system, with member only areas and member only items and perks. 
add my Skype

Skype=ryan.g874 if interested

              <p>Items implanted into server<br>
Slayer helm<br>
Trident<br>
Armadyl crossbow<br>
Kraken whip<br>
Dragon pickaxe</p>
<p>I’m currently a welder who works 60 hours a week and makes about 5 grand a month. I’m willing to put 1grand a month into the server. I really want to start something big. I’m open to new ideas but looking to form a serious team. All donations will be spread evenly. And if your looking for pay I’m all ears. I will take care of all the expensive things. I will buy banners on mopar rune locus and runes ever and other sites if you wish. I have a vps that is 8192mb ram. And if needed will improve. To 24678mb ram if server gets popular. I have 2grand to invest to start which will cover banners and everything else. I’m looking for a dedicated team who will make the next big server. I would like to keep it 07 based but I’m all ears for other ideas. We can speak over skype after 6:00 pm eastern time. Otherwise I can talk on my breaks from work. Only looking for serious applicants.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
