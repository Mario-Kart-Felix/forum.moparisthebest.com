    <title>Stop with the GFX AND EMOTES!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/stop-with-the-gfx-and-emotes/318487</link>
    <description>Title. No one cares if you&#39;ve made some code to add something from the current version of RuneScape. It&#39;s just taking up space that should be used for something more useful. Custom interfaces too. And for all who care, I will not be releasing the new Interface Maker and won&#39;t be putting up the old one, because I was blind and didn&#39;t see how horrible it and &quot;hardcoding&quot; is. Any reproduction of it and I&#39;ll have it locked.

Seriously though, there is no progress going on in this community. It&#39;s only going to get worse. Try to take a look at the client and figure something out. It&#39;s not that hard, so don&#39;t complain with &quot;Oh, well we&#39;re MoparScape so no one&#39;s actually smart enough to do that&quot;. All it takes to find something is pretty much to search for a cache resource and trace what it gets loaded into and work from there.

To a moderator who wants to lock this: Go ahead. Let nothing be done.</description>

              <p>So basically what your saying is dont sit around making codes and shit like swat and what not and put them into 317 just do a full 525 or whatever version you choose and fully convert it for 317 and release so there isnt anymore little peices of codes like veng and dclaw emote and gs emotes and stuff or what your trying to say is instead of wasting our times on making the 317 updated and basically showing runescape that the 317 version they created has updated to basically what they have now and just use the version you like (Example - 317,474,500+) rite? well i personally think that upgrading the 317 base (client and server side) is a really nice idea but instead of people releasing stuff like emotes and gfx how about not release anything and actually make people learn to do the things they want so instead of having people use all the shit thats been released adding it to a server and client and releasing it and or running and having people say oh thats leeched or nice server you released/are running and taking everyone elses credits making the stuff there self then they have something to be proud of i can say that i have leeched stuff in the past but i dont do private servers anymore cuz im wasting my time cuz iv been making well trying to make private servers for about a year now and iv barley learned anything cuz like for example i had planned to add real dclaw gfx and emote to 317 then ppl come around and release the shit then there is no point in adding it cuz people going to say its leeched but dont get me wrong i enjoy trying to learn to make private servers but when people like swat and blurr and even you. keep releasing stuff noobs like me dont learn anything cuz they say why try to learn it if its gonna be handed to me see what im saying</p>

nobody wants to go that extra length to pack things into the cache, for me, ive tried to pack things and have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>(every time i try to pack a model into the cache it will give it a new id, and i cant replace the blank file with that model’s id)<br>
(same with alot of other things)<br>
[/quote]That really has nothing to do with what I said. I said to topic posting useless shit like GFX and emote codes, and to try and find something with the client.[/quote]<br>
Release your renamer.</p>

Well i support, and yes, if you want 508+ interfaces, models, and gfx’s , might as well play a 508+…</p>
<p>And personally no offence but the whole interface maker concept was kindof dumb, honestly why can’t they just hardcode, its not hard, either look at other interfaces to find out what everything does, or just find a tut somewhere…<br>

<p>fuck no am I going to 508 if I want my server to have 474+ emotes</p>
<p>508s are unstable piles of shit, and I know it’s a step in a better direction (client-wise) but the server couldn’t hold 6 players on a VPS without lag[/quote]</p>
<p>Not all 508 servers are unstable and shit; RS2HD being one that isn’t - it’s the best current 508 framework there is.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/lin">@Lin</a>: I agree totally. This is why I am currently coding a 508 server rather than a 317. There is just so much more potential with 508’s, and you don’t have to ‘hardcode’ anything, as most animations, GFX’s and items you want are already there for you.</p>

No you wont sir.[/quote]I will try. Someone reposting a shit program I made when I forbid it shouldn’t be allowed.
