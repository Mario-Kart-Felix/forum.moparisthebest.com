    <title>Can&#39;t seem to figure out what I&#39;m doing wrong</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-seem-to-figure-out-what-im-doing-wrong/445278</link>
    <description>For some reason I can set the client for my RS-PS to work for me on the server. But when I send someone else the client files. (With the cache included. I haven&#39;t added a automatic cache system yet. Also with the correct server IP and port.) It dose nothing for them.

If someone could TeamViewer me or something to help me resolve this issue it would be much appreciated. Cause let&#39;s face it I&#39;ll probably end up messing up the server or client. (New to RS-PS/Java Script.)

-Thanks for reading and potentially your feedback and help. :P</description>
