    <description>Hey guys, basically I&#39;m having trouble making npcs work.

I had a source, a PI-based source which everything working, and eventually i found out combat was giving errors, and trying to attack monsters was broken.

So i basically switched sources, to another PI-based source, transferred the characters, and moved the codes over one by one.

Now, in the old source that I started off with, the npcs worked fine in the home area that I made, it actually came with the old source.

However, when I transferred them, when I click them to like talk to them, they don&#39;t work anymore

What is the solution?
