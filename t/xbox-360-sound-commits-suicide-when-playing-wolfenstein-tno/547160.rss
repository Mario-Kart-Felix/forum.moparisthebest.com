    <title>Xbox 360 Sound Commits Suicide When Playing Wolfenstein: TNO</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/xbox-360-sound-commits-suicide-when-playing-wolfenstein-tno/547160</link>
    <description>Alright so recently I got a copy of Wolfenstein: The New Order for my Xbox 360, and was fine until I hit the third level. Recently I can only get anywhere from 1min - 15min into to it, because the sound cuts out and I have to restart the Xbox, and the mission because reloading the checkpoint makes the sound immediately go out. This isn&#39;t the game sound cutting out, the WHOLE system cuts out, no menu noise, game or anything else. I unplug my turtle beaches and play through the TV, and I reach the same fate. This also only occurs when playing Wolfenstein, nothing else, and this has never happened before, any help?</description>
