    <title>Hello Boys!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hello-boys/550110</link>
    <description>[center]Hey forum users. I&#39;ll be going by the name EasyWan Capi through and across this board and a couple others.

I&#39;ve recently been blessed with a baby boy &amp; double blessed by Jamflex banning my OS account! :smileyface:
I finally have the release and freedom I&#39;ve been needing to focus on my own self/career. 

My Goal at this time is learning to code my own source and client!(It&#39;ll take some time. Yes I&#39;m aware.)

I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of building my own RSPS also leading to me perusing knowledge in ACTUAL java coding.
Before this moment I spent the last summer learning &quot;RSPS java.&quot; 
Unfortunately during the summer I was stuck with a data plan, no longer am I. 

Anyway, I have basic java down which has made things x100 easier to understand. 

SO! Thank you all for reading this little introduction. Plan on seeing EasyWan Capi around :smileyface:[/center]</description>

<p>Hi, welcome to MoparScape. And just so you know, as you’re probably going to be told again… don’t use RSPS to learn Java. I personally have never built upon the idea of learning Java VIA RSPS because I went to web development and such a few years back but from my understanding, it’s like the worst thing to do - ever (or at least as people make it out to seem).</p>

<p>I am very aware of this my dear and it is why I’m taking the time to learn learn real java.</p>
