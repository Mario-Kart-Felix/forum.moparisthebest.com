    <description>I don&#39;t even know how to explain this but maybe one of you has felt this. Random ass post kind of has relevance to programming.

So whenever I write a program I write it and I hate it? I don&#39;t know why, but when I look through the code I just want to start again and it&#39;s basically just an infinite loop. I always do it better the next time I do it, it&#39;s just things take so long doing it this way. It&#39;s like my standards are so much higher then what I can produce. This is a random post but I want to know if any of you know this feeling.

I do group projects at school for programming, I focus around C# and I just can&#39;t handle seeing someone trying to meet my standards it frustrates me. I hate this feeling honestly it just makes things so much harder.

Is there something wrong with me or do you peps know my feels? Cheers.</description>

              <p>I find that this is really common, especially for people learning it on there own. Something that may help is automated testing. It’s not something that is really discussed in communities like this, but it is a means to an end of frustration. Testing helps preserve the longevity of your code, prevent bugs, help explain what the code is capable of, and in some cases also proves correctness (or, in the least, functionality). The first part is the most important of all of them. I find that disliking code is often due to missing oversights later in the project, leading to either major refactoring or scraping parts of the project. Although this cannot be permanently prevented (hence why project management in software is so much different than other fields), testing is a very large help in trying to minimize it.</p>
<p>If you’re working on a team, I also strongly suggest code reviews. They help provide feedback for every line of code you write. It’s hard to write bad code if it’s well-tested, documented, formatted nicely, shown to work, and looked at by two different software engineers. It’s still possible, but much less likely. If you’re not working on a team, feel free to ask a fellow programmer to do a code review for you sometime. It’s extremely helpful.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about either topics, I’ll be happy to share.</p>

<p>Fair enough, but just focusing on acceptance isn’t really me to be honest, I love aiming high especially when I set myself a goal which is completely out of my capability. I honestly think you’re right tbh.</p>

<p>Exactly, but here’s another problem. I’m more of a hands on guy, I love the programming side of things the write up dealing with stakeholders isn’t really me. So basically if it;s a solo project I never get round to the write up, I always do it once i’ve completed the project, which sucks because it’s hard to break it down into smaller parts, I just develop on the go and I know it’s wrong. I just have always done so.</p>
<p>[quote=“Lin, post:9, topic:551670”]This is completely normal, but it’s best not to scrap everything and rewrite (unless it’s a test project to learn). To give you an idea, I’ve been working on Codename::World for like over a year now and I still tweak and rewrite code I wrote at the very beginning - even the very first classes I wrote I’ll change to make to better. You can always go back and make changes later, even to internal system workings. And you probably will have to as well, due to design changes, additional requirements, optimizations…</p>
<p>Lately I’ve actually been using a whiteboard and a sort of different approach to programming I never used to do. Instead of just writing code the first time to make it as good as possible, I write/draw out how something will work on a whiteboard and then roughly program it in to try and get it working - because it might not, and I would’ve tried optimizing it for no reason. This makes problem solving easier too because you aren’t taking shortcuts or worrying about if one of your optimizations is the cause of the problem. And of course, <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrematureOptimization" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">premature optimization is the root of all evil anyways.</a>[/quote]</p>
<p>You just worded what I do so much better then I could’ve imagined. I have tried it with my white board, I just end up not using it which sucks because I love seeing things it just makes things easier. I do optimisations but I end up rewriting the entire class and I feel as though i’m not getting anywhere because I just keep optimising it. Ahh the struggles…</p>

              <p>This could also a good case for test driven development. If you write all of the cases you can think of near the beginning, then when all of your tests pass can be a good indicator that you’ve met the acceptance criteria (being the tests you’ve written). Then, when you want to make any changes, you can rely on your previous test to help validate that it works.</p>

              <p>Focusing on acceptance criteria is probably the best thing you can do. You should also focus on ROI, or return on investment. What are you getting out of it if you trash the entire thing and do it again? Is it worth it? If it’s a program for experience or learning, that’s fine.</p>
<p>I used to be affected by this. But then i came to the realization that i will never get it “perfect”. And that’s fine. I’ll get it working, and then get it working well.</p>

              <p>not personally, but I’ve worked with people like you in group projects in the past and can confirm it is a pain in the ass to get anything done. I guess it’s easier said than done but try focusing more on acceptance criteria and use that to judge when your work is done</p>
<p>also you probably just have aspergers</p>

              <p>I don’t even know how to explain this but maybe one of you has felt this. Random ass post kind of has relevance to programming.</p>
<p>So whenever I write a program I write it and I hate it? I don’t know why, but when I look through the code I just want to start again and it’s basically just an infinite loop. I always do it better the next time I do it, it’s just things take so long doing it this way. It’s like my standards are so much higher then what I can produce. This is a random post but I want to know if any of you know this feeling.</p>
<p>I do group projects at school for programming, I focus around C# and I just can’t handle seeing someone trying to meet my standards it frustrates me. I hate this feeling honestly it just makes things so much harder.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with me or do you peps know my feels? Cheers.</p>
