    <description>When you&#39;re fighting in the wild, you get sent back to the startin point with the message &quot;oh dear you are dead&quot; but you didn&#39;t die, you still have everything you were wearing on, but your invent is gone :S

This happens 40% of the time when pking its really annoying and don&#39;t know what it could be :S</description>
