    <description>Off Topic: I&#39;m new to rsps coding/developing, and I&#39;m trying to create my first server. Just running it locally and then going to BETA on Hamachi with a few friends to test the server out, and once I get it glitch/bug free as much as I&#39;d like it, and to where the server would run successfully with others actively playing I&#39;ll start hosting it publicly.

On Topic: I was curious if anyone would mind helping me out with fixing my mage on my server.
Every time mage is used on a npc, it glitches your character to where you won&#39;t hit anything, with mage, melee, or range until you relog.
I&#39;d appreciate it if anyone would help me.

PS: Flame/Ignorance isn&#39;t needed. I&#39;m an amateur java coder, but I&#39;m starting to like rsps coding, and help would really be nice. Everyone needs help sometime in there life. ;)</description>

<p>Hmm, Welcome to RSPS Coding! I am not the type of person to say give up if your new. I think it’s good more people are getting into RSPS coding. What revision is your current source? I would recommend switching it as your problem could be quite difficult to fix…</p>

<p>Thanks bro, to be honest, I’m not quite sure what the base is… It seems like someone just released it and it’s sloppily coded… As I’ve fixed multiple errors (112+) since I downloaded it… <em>facepalm</em><br>
It’s supposeably a 317, but it seems like it may be a 600+, but I’m new to rsps coding, so I’m not quite sure…</p>
<p>Off-Topic: Hmm… Does anyone know of a good source+client to start off with?<br>
(I’ve tried looking, I mainly like 317-508 or whatever it is before they start getting too graphic.)<br>
I’m trying to find a good base to start with and create to my own style and the one I have doesn’t seem to great…</p>
