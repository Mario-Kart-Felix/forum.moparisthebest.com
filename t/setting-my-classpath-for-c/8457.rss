    <title>Setting My Classpath for C++</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/setting-my-classpath-for-c/8457</link>
    <description>I made another topic in &quot;questions&quot;, but I was told to post here, so Mods or Admins can deleate my other topic.

But anyways, I have finnally took the first step for programming my game, and I started codeing some stuff in C++, but my compiler says I need to set my Classpath for C++ (It is set for Java right now), and I cannot make anything if I cannot compile it ;D Any Help is appreciated!</description>
