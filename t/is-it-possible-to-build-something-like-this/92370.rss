    <title>Is it possible to build something like this...?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-it-possible-to-build-something-like-this/92370</link>
    <description>Hi, I would like to start a project very soon.I have been studying server coding for a while now and I think I&#39;m ready. I will either name it TowerScape (please tell me if already used), or DungeonScape. 

For towers, is it possibly to make like a 6-7+ story building? Client side? If so, any tuts/links? Is it easy? A brief explanation please, thanks?

<p>If you did what I said, and add the coords, then the ladder’s tele would not be random. You can hard code each teleport for certain coords as you wish, not random.</p>

you probly could do what real rs does…when you click on a ladder it will tele you somewhere else (in your case just another story to your building). What I mean is, instead of actually making it really tall, you could make it one story but make it seem really tall by instead of going up, you get tele’d somewhere else<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I don’t think that would work because you could only code one telly for the ladder. You could make one story a ladder, another a stair case, another a blue portal,another a red portal. and just set the tellys on it. Or you could code a client that worked with ladders… That would be hard…[/quote]</p>
<p>not true, u can have multiple teles for 1 object id. Just make it the coordinates for that object, tele u to x…</p>

              <p>Hi, I would like to start a project very soon.I have been studying server coding for a while now and I think I’m ready. I will either name it TowerScape (please tell me if already used), or DungeonScape.</p>
<p>For towers, is it possibly to make like a 6-7+ story building? Client side? If so, any tuts/links? Is it easy? A brief explanation please, thanks?</p>
