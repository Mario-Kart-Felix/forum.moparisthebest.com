    <description>well so far ive been able to get a circuit working like i wanted. my question though is why when i move my pressure pad does it change the out come? is there a delay causing a problem? if so would i have to do is add a delay on the part of the circuit that is faster than the other. my idea was making a circuit is a switch that keeps its state. idk if there is an easier way to do it than i did. but i took a IC class in high school so the gates arent anything new. but im wanting to do way more complex projects. what i would like to see though in Minecraft is magnets and electric magnets, i think you could do a lot of cool things. essentially you could build a speaker like that worked if the game physics allowed it.

my circuit uses 2 and, 2 nor, 2 not, 1 rs nor latch, 1 delay, and a couple of repeaters.</description>
