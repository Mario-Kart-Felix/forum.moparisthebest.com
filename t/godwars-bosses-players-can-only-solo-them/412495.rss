    <title>Godwars bosses, players can only solo them?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/godwars-bosses-players-can-only-solo-them/412495</link>
    <description>When The bosses are under attack, and another player try to come in, it says &quot;npc is already under attack&quot;
or some bullshit like that, any clue on how to fix it?

Gave a look in Npchandler, nothing in there(as of what i found)

Please and thank you.</description>
