    <title>[Delta] Toggling &#39;Members Object&#39;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/delta-toggling-members-object/447845</link>
    <description>Hey guys,
As the title states, I need help toggling the &#39;Members Object&#39; off. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve done this, and I remember it was in [b]Client.java[/b]. What I don&#39;t remember is what Boolean it was to toggle this feature on/off. Would anyone happen to know which Boolean I need to change (changing the Boolean to true/false) to toggle this feature?</description>

              <p>Hey guys,<br>
As the title states, I need help toggling the ‘Members Object’ off. It’s been a while since I’ve done this, and I remember it was in <span class="bbcode-b">Client.java</span>. What I don’t remember is what Boolean it was to toggle this feature on/off. Would anyone happen to know which Boolean I need to change (changing the Boolean to true/false) to toggle this feature?</p>
