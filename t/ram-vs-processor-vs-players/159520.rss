    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/ram-vs-processor-vs-players/159520</link>
    <description>At this moment, I have a 1.8GHz processor with 512MB of RAM. My max amount of players on my server was about 40 until I got some lag.  I was wondering if I had 1.8GHz  processor and 1GB of RAM, would that bring me about to about 100 players? Can someone please tell me why more RAM would allow me to have more players? I know that a better processor would, because it would allow my computer to be faster, but how does RAM get into the picture?

Thanks,
Play For Keeps</description>

Stop it with the flaming about knowledge on programming languages. Yes, lots of people on these forums do not know much, but they’re all here to learn something new. We all started somewhere.

<p>Not really. I don’t try to look big… I just put my head down and program to the best of the ability.</p>
<p>[quote=“Play For Keeps, post:14, topic:159520”]Do you want to bet? I know languages in Java, CSS, SMF, HTML, XML, I can program (if I already haven’t) clients, search engines, what ever I want.

<p>EDIT: and thanks hippie[/quote]<br>
HTML isn’t a language, it is a markup.<br>
CSS is piss easy. SMF isn’t even a language I don’t think. XML is a markup.<br>
If you can program, then why do you suck at Java. If you were any good at it you would use at least basic OOP within your code.</p>
