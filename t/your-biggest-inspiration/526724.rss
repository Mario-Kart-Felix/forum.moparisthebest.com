    <title>Your BIGGEST inspiration</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/your-biggest-inspiration/526724</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been completely changed as a person ever since I have found an inspiration, which has pretty much changed the way I look at anything I do, no matter how simple the task is. This past year, I have been doing a lot of research and watching videos about Bruce Lee, because I believe everything he did was to change the world and to prove to himself, and the world, that anything is possible. Like many other people and things in the world, he has inspired many people and changed the way the world views martial arts. Although he is no longer alive, and I never actually met him, he has inspired me to become a better person and believe in something, even if you are the only one that believes.

Who or what has inspired you?</description>

I know you do not normally speak that way, so there is no way I’m going to believe you. I believe this forum has enough trolling as is, and I think it should stay out of something meant to be serious.</p>
<p><span class="mention">@L</span>&amp;P I wasn’t referring to you, because I knew you were serious, as I can see Ron Jeremy being an inspiration, although I didn’t know if you meant it emotionally or physically.</p>

I’m glad to see someone here is actually serious.[/quote]I am as well actually. For the very few who actually know who Ron Jeremy is they should also know that Ron Jeremy gives relationship advice(ironically he can’t keep a steady one).</p>
<p>When I met my girlfriend at first we had several issues with each other but through reading up on some of his advice we have come closer to each other. Both physically and emotionally.</p>

              <p>I’ve been completely changed as a person ever since I have found an inspiration, which has pretty much changed the way I look at anything I do, no matter how simple the task is. This past year, I have been doing a lot of research and watching videos about Bruce Lee, because I believe everything he did was to change the world and to prove to himself, and the world, that anything is possible. Like many other people and things in the world, he has inspired many people and changed the way the world views martial arts. Although he is no longer alive, and I never actually met him, he has inspired me to become a better person and believe in something, even if you are the only one that believes.</p>
<p>Who or what has inspired you?</p>
