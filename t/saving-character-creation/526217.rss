    <title>Saving Character Creation</title>

    <description>Hi guys, I realize that so many people have asked this question but I have been sitting here trying so hard to find a guide or website or even a post that can help me out. Before you say &quot;use the search button&quot;, I have. I have tried Google, multiple rsps-server sites, searching, going through posts, I even asked the nerds on my skype friends&#39; list :(.. everything that I am capable of doing.. and I am not having any luck. I&#39;m not asking you to spoonfeed me anything, I&#39;m just looking for a tip or tutorial or ANYTHING that can help me with this issue.

My server right now has everything down from being able to access the character creation command to being able to pick anything that&#39;s in there. 
However, when you choose something and click accept, it&#39;ll save and everything. Well, since I&#39;m really a co-owner, I asked the owner himself to tell me if he see&#39;s any changes whatsoever, and having my luck, the answer is no. The other issue is that after changing, you can equip anything and it reverts back to default.

Do any of you have any idea as to why nobody else can see the changes being made/why it won&#39;t &quot;technically&quot; save?

If any of you have any answers, just please post.</description>

              <p>I really like people like you. Ones who do all their research, ask their friends, and not ask to be spoonfed. I will help you because this is your last resort (albeit the wrong section).</p>
<p>The problem seems to be after you hit the accept button, the values aren’t really being saved. This is shown when you equip an item and your appearance resets. The reason it actually resets is because an appearance update is set to be true, and when one happens, the values stored for your character’s appearance weren’t modified in the first place. So check the accept button for the interface and make sure you see something like playerAppearance[0] = whatever, or something along those lines. After that code you should see something like ‘appearanceUpdateRequired = true; updateRequired = true;’.</p>
