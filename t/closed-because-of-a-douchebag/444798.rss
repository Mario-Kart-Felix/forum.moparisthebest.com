    <description>Hello do you want your server to not be random numbers so people trust you?

Well send me a message and i will give you a subdomain :&gt;

SPACES LEFT: 5 free DNS sub-domains.

&lt;yourservername&gt;.netoracraft.com 
thats what your users will connect to.

thanks

your a fucking moron, that is exactly what offline mode is… when the duc 3.0 is offline or shutdown with $12 no-ip will continue to forward…</p>
<p>also if oyu update manually your no-ip duc 3.0 is still running is it not?</p>
<p>if you continue to run the Duc 3.0 then ofcourse its still going to redirect.</p>

NO-IP A TYPE DNS (the dns needed to redirect ports with servers) is $12 for offlien mode… im not talking about servers on computers i wont host thoughs… im talking about 24/7 VPS servers that are constantly up… with almost no downtime…<br>
people dont want to pay no-ip $12 a month to keep there stupid “no-ip” links up in premium mode because its expensive… its not confusing if you do your research of no-ip… the other “free” offline mode redirects are for website redirecting. i researched and tried myself…</p>
<p><img src="http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/414/thistj.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
offline mode means when Duc 3.0 is not running it will continue to redirect to the ip… its $12 a month… and its stupid…</p>
<p>like i saidi m offering to give them a DNS redirect without having to download any No-ip shit or pay $12 a month…</p>

              <p>Uh no, I don’t have the application on my computer and my no-ip still works when my PC is offline, I know that for a fact because I recently hosted the hunger games using it. So I ask again, why would I use your service?</p>
<p>Even if what you’re saying was true, pretty much everybody is going to host the no-ip application on the same machine that the MC server is hosted on (to take advantage of the auto updating if the IP is dynamic too). So, if the no-ip application wasn’t running the MC server wouldn’t be either therefore you’re achieving the same thing (no server to connect to).</p>

your stupid, were not talking about the providers. were talking about offline support.<br>
you have to pay $12 to have no-ip to run the DNS without the applicaiton running on your computer.<br>
for most people, they care about there computer and turn it off every 6 hours.</p>
<p>no ip’s offer:<br>
Online mode = running on your computer 24/7<br>
$12/month offline mode = dont worry about the application, we will forward the ip on or offline.</p>
<p>my offer: dont pay $12 a month il do it for free offline and online.</p>
