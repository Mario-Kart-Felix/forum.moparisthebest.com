    <description>hey guys, i&#39;m interested to know how long it took you after playing runescape to hit the &quot;rsps scene&quot; and do you still play runescape or have fully gone rsps? :D
i&#39;ll start us off:
i code alot of things and every now and then i play runescape if i&#39;m pushed that far into boredom :3
i started rs: early 2006, rsps: late 2008 but learned some c++ and c# before that. all my java skill since i started rsps tho has come from solely rsps ;P</description>

              <p>Logged onto RuneScape the first time when I was 9. I am now 10, so it’s been awhile. No, just kidding, I did first log on to RuneScape when I was 9 years old, I didn’t find much interest in it so logged off naturally. I then became interested in it when I was ~12 years old, played off and on, then when I was 15 I moved and lost all my friends, so I became more into RuneScape, I am not 18 and play from time to time, but I enjoy coding them when I have nothing to do. RuneScape is just another video game to me, but there is never nothing you can do, which keeps people playing it more and more. They are always making new mini-games, quests, items, skills, ect. Things to make you want to play even more. Which is why I still play it. I then got into RSPS when I was about 16, my first server I played was Test-Scape, I played on my friends Hamachi server, then he didn’t like running it, so I looked for others and got hooked on the crappily coded pieces of shit servers… It made it so much fun, now all these servers are corrupted and have to be 100% perfect. I’ve actually thought about making and releasing a huge piece of shit server, nicely coded but just looks ugly. Just to get that old feel of RSPS back.</p>
