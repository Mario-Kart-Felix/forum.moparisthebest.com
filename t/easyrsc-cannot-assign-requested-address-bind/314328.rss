    <title>EasyRSC : Cannot assign requested address: bind</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easyrsc-cannot-assign-requested-address-bind/314328</link>
    <description>Hey guys, I&#39;m stuck with this : [b][i]Cannot assign requested address: bind[/i][/b] when I start EasyRSC server.

I searched on every post with that error and still got one.

I edited [b]Server.java[/b] with my [b]default gateway[/b] which is 192.168.2.1
I edited [b]Settings.ini[/b] with my [b]External IP[/b] (from www.whatismyip.com)

I Portfowarded. (image below) (Not sure if I put the good IP...)

On some others posts, people said to kill all java process, which I did and still got the problem.

Another thing I would like to know. In order to people to be able to connect to it, I have to run it from my server I suppose? But why insert my IP? I don&#39;t really get that part lol. Anyways Hope you guys can help me a bit!

Thanks.</description>

<p>On most posts, people say to put default gateway on Server.java.</p>
<p>Btw, is it possible to run the server on your own personal computer without the need of a Dedi/Vps? I mean, running it so everyone can connect on it if they have the client…</p>

You need to be forwarding the ip[ you stick in server.java, try to have 192.168.2.1 in server.java and forward that and if that dosent work do the same for 192.168.2.8.</p>
<p>else, your firewall might be blocking incomming traffic.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Nice, I tried with 192.168.2.8 in my server.java file and the error is gone! The thing is that it works, but only when I run EasyRSC from my own PC. The error is still there when I open EasyRSC from my server… I have to portforward with the server IP?[/quote]</p>
<p>Usually from a dedicated box, you dont need to forward any ports. It will eaither be your default gatway ip that goes in server.java or the ip from <a href="http://whatsmyip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">whatsmyip.org</a>. Im not sure which one because i havent run easyrsc form a dedi yet.</p>
