    <title>Easy server starter</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easy-server-starter/156009</link>
    <description>Hey everyone, was just messing around with my compiler and runserver, and found that instead of running both of them and moparscape (I am aware that you can compile and runserver with one .bat), I found that if you put [code]&quot;%programfiles%\MoparScape\MoparScape.jar&quot;[/code] into it, you can just have it on your desktop and when you run it, it will compile ur server, run ur server and open mopar, so make a .bat and have it as 
[code]@echo off
title ServerRunner
&quot;%programfiles%\MoparScape\MoparScape.jar&quot;
javac *.java
java -cp .;./jython.jar server[/code]

This has probably already been discovered but anyway if it hasnt..there you go :)</description>
