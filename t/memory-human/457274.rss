    <title>Memory (Human)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/memory-human/457274</link>
    <description>This topic isn&#39;t going to be that medically detailed as I&#39;m pretty sure none of us are PHD doctors or anything but...
I find myself with a lack of people that I&#39;m able to talk about memory, so I&#39;m not sure what is normal and what isn&#39;t.
I think my memory in general is absolutely terrible in comparison to most people, long and short term. I&#39;m trying to find answers regarding that. Ruling out things on my own as best I can, eg. Trying to figure out if I&#39;m just fucking retarded or I have some kind of memory condition.

Examples:

I seem to have no memory what so ever of my past from ages 0-13. Even around 13, I cannot confirm the memory was at that age. It&#39;s extremely fuzzy. The earliest one I can -probably- confirm is the normal age for a person in Year 9 (I say normal because I was skipped a year and don&#39;t know what the normal age for a person to be in Year 9.) Even then, huge chunks of time are missing. Even huge experiences to me are lost, apparently I went hang-gliding when I was like 14 or 16 in NZ(I&#39;m 19 now). I don&#39;t remember anything of it, but I know I did it because of pictures shown to me, so I know facts, according to pictures. But even that feels wrong.

I was in a party with most of my old high school friends and they have no trouble recalling hilarious events of us mucking around but I find myself unable to.

So? I&#39;m guessing this isn&#39;t normal.</description>

<p>I don’t think this is true at all. I can’t remember the code to get back into my apartment on a cold winter night but I can remember every word to the Smashmouth song “All Star”. You never know what’s going to trigger your memory or not; sometimes you just can’t remember the things that are actually important to survival; neurochemistry is weird shit.</p>

Zoss, you probably know how to tie your shoes but you don’t remember the first time you learned how. Which hardly any of us remember, we might be able to think of it but we can’t bring up that visual. If you can’t remember anything from ages 0-13 (even I remember the the middle school fights between kids) then you need to see a doctor. Maybe there is a just a slot in your brain that isn’t reachable anymore.</p>

              <p>My earliest definite memory is from when I was 3 and I fell into a bull pit a the saleyards and I cracked my skull. I can remember the morning, before it happened, I can remember going to the doctors after and not wanting an x-ray, I can remember going to the hospital and getting more x-rays and I can even remember the dream I had that night. Darth Vader was next to a space ship and had one of those things that holds the blood transfusion/drip bag things. I also remember that the next morning I had strawberry jam on toast for breakfast.<br>
I can remember pretty much my whole life after that point and I am at the top of the class in physics, chemistry, statistics and general science of my classes except as soon as I’m in math exams I just tank completely and fuck up. Some sort of stress problem.</p>
<p>But yeah, maybe try writing a diary every day or something? That might get your brain to remember stuff more as writing stuff down reinforces memory.</p>

              <p>The types of memories that I have from that age, are what make me question reality the most. The few memories I do have, I can’t really call memories; they were more like dreams.</p>
<p>There is one in particular that I have. I was very young, probably no more than 2 years old, and it involved me driving my grandmothers van into a lake/pond. This would probably be a traumatic event to most people, especially at that age, but I don’t recall any feelings. No fear, no panic, no anxiety, nothing. This is what makes it seem like more of a dream. In my other memories, I can remember so much more. Happiness, frusturated, reactions by others. But for this particular dream, there was nothing.</p>
<p>Some of my family members say it happened, some say it didn’t. There’s no record of it happening in the service logs, and no payments being made for any damages. The logical conclusion would be that they sold it off the books, as-is. However, there are service logs afterwards, and they had it for 3 years afterwards. This confuses me, because my grandfather enjoyed having new, nice, clean cars.</p>

              <p>I guess the biggest problem for you at the moment is your self esteem. If you feel like your memory doesn’t work you might get stressed, and under-perform at exams even if you could do just fine if you just felt better about yourself. Just like atychiphobia can result in a person under-performing, even though there’s nothing wrong with people who are afraid of failing. Gaining confidence can do wonders.</p>
<p>Are there any other major events you don’t remember? I don’t think it’s a problem your friends can recall mucking around and you can’t, perhaps you didn’t enjoy it as much as they did and it didn’t leave that big an impression.</p>
<p>Don’t think that you’ll fail before you’ve even started. Just prepare yourself very good for your exams. Start as soon as you know the chapters that are required for the exam. Read the chapter the day before class, take notes during class and perhaps reread the chapter and perhaps take notes again or add to the notes you made earlier. Keep reviewing the notes, and now and then open the book to read a chapter or two. Being sure about what you are doing might mean that you have less time for other activities, but it pays in the end. Taking notes is pretty much essential if you want to learn properly. For most courses, I only opened the book the day before the exam. I learnt most just paying attention during class and taking notes. Don’t give up, try talking about it with your parents anyways and just do your best.</p>
<p>I’m no expert, so don’t take anything I say as fact, it’s just my view!</p>

<p>But you not being able to remember hang-gliding 3 to 5 years ago isn’t a good sign. I’d imagine something like that sticks, unless you do it on a daily basis. You don’t have to be able to recall every detail, but it should have made an impression.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor, and if you worry about this you should visit one. Even if it’s just to ease your mind. If you think you are losing parts of your memory, even if in reality you are not, you can lose self-esteem and it will affect your actions.[/quote]<br>
Yeah, definitely something I don’t do everyday.</p>

It is rather depressing but it kind of isn’t at the same time. You kind of can’t really get depressed over something you can’t remember. It’s more frustrating if anything.</p>
<p>So I had a CT scan recently. According to the medical centre calling me up there seems to be no abnormalities.</p>
<p>Having test after test come back pretty much negative (had a ANA come back positive and thyroid tanked one blood test, along with bigger red blood cells than normal) and having a doctor who feels like he’s taking it lightly just feels so frustrating. Almost like he doesn’t think that anything is wrong with you.</p>
<p>It’s not like you can prove it, it’s memory. It’s not like I’m missing something physical or anything. Makes you think, am I just retarded or just stupid? Is this just normal because it’s me? It’s really worrying, as it affects my future as well.</p>
<p>I’m taking a Uni course to get into an IT field. However, I am terrible at exams (requires remembering a lot of things) and earlier things I’ve ‘learned’ will be forgotten, hence probably failing at future jobs and/or the course. I’ve never been that physically ‘able’ either, so it’s pretty much impossible for me to get a labour job.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess I’m just bitching to you guys as I can’t really talk well to my family about it.</p>
<p>I guess all I can do is just seek medical help eh?</p>

<p>Never touched drugs in my life, I find the idea of them stupid. Alcohol is also very boring to me. I only drink rarely and for taste only.</p>

Haha, yeah I’d probably forget but I kept this as an open tab so I wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Yeah, I am seeing a doctor but he’s kind of nonchalant about this, probably because I’m young - I’ve heard doctors have this impression that the young are resilient to getting sick.</p>

None that I know about. Also don’t know my family history well at all. As far as I know, I don’t have any other diseases, then again I rarely see the doctor, and this may seem silly to most of you, but I have a really bad sense to know what’s normal and what isn’t, so I tend to stay away from the doctor to prevent being a bother.</p>
<p>Thanks for the responses though, it really does help to know what type of memory is normal for others.</p>

<p>But you not being able to remember hang-gliding 3 to 5 years ago isn’t a good sign. I’d imagine something like that sticks, unless you do it on a daily basis. You don’t have to be able to recall every detail, but it should have made an impression.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor, and if you worry about this you should visit one. Even if it’s just to ease your mind. If you think you are losing parts of your memory, even if in reality you are not, you can lose self-esteem and it will affect your actions.</p>

              <p>This topic isn’t going to be that medically detailed as I’m pretty sure none of us are PHD doctors or anything but…<br>
I find myself with a lack of people that I’m able to talk about memory, so I’m not sure what is normal and what isn’t.<br>
I think my memory in general is absolutely terrible in comparison to most people, long and short term. I’m trying to find answers regarding that. Ruling out things on my own as best I can, eg. Trying to figure out if I’m just fucking retarded or I have some kind of memory condition.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>I seem to have no memory what so ever of my past from ages 0-13. Even around 13, I cannot confirm the memory was at that age. It’s extremely fuzzy. The earliest one I can -probably- confirm is the normal age for a person in Year 9 (I say normal because I was skipped a year and don’t know what the normal age for a person to be in Year 9.) Even then, huge chunks of time are missing. Even huge experiences to me are lost, apparently I went hang-gliding when I was like 14 or 16 in NZ(I’m 19 now). I don’t remember anything of it, but I know I did it because of pictures shown to me, so I know facts, according to pictures. But even that feels wrong.</p>
<p>I was in a party with most of my old high school friends and they have no trouble recalling hilarious events of us mucking around but I find myself unable to.</p>
<p>So? I’m guessing this isn’t normal.</p>
