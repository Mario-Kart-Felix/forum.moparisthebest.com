    <title>A few client bugs</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-few-client-bugs/551593</link>
    <description>Hello, I have been experiencing a few client bugs lately which led to me to posting here. I was curious if anyone here knew how to fix any of these and would be kind enough to me out some in fixing these. 

1. My first issue is my report abuse interface (interface: 5875) being glitched and having a mask appearing on top of it

I already tried disabling all of my other hard coded interfaces in my Interfaces class client sided to see if interfering ids with the interfaces was the issue. However, I tested that and it did not fix the issue.

2. My second issue is I have changed everything up to support 120 dungeoneering, however every 30 seconds or something like that it drops 1 level just like a potion would until eventually it hits level 99 again. And also when you hover it when you have above 99 for the skill it still says the amount you have over 99 (so for example 120/99 and it should say 120/120 since you have the skill on 120)

3. My player chat models are messed up, I have tried to fix this but with no success. This is what it looks like:

4. My iron man and hardcore/ultimate ranks have white space on them and I can&#39;t find any other ranks for them. I think the best way to get rid of them is photoshop, but my photoshop ran out. Is there any other ways to fix them or does someone possibly have the fixed versions of them?

The two sprites for them are here: [url=http://uppit.com/6f1vd8dg36tm/Ironman.zip]Download Ironman.zip @ UppIT[/url] (I am putting them here just in case someone possibly could fix those for me if they don&#39;t already have the fixed version)

5. After I packed 667 data setting up my cannon is now messed up. Here is a picture of the stages of setting up my cannon:

As you can see during most of the stages of setting up the cannon it becomes a big messed up head model. I don&#39;t even know where to begin to fix this issue. I know the cannon worked fine prior to 667 data. I would remove the data to fix the issue, however I would like to keep the data for other things as most things are fine with it.

6. My magic log is messed up. Originally it was invisible then I repacked the magic log model 26902 into index1. The model that I packed worked okay however it has some issues:

I was hoping someone had a better magic log model, or a way to fix this as it would it be nice to get the actual sparkles on the log like runescape rather than just a normal white/blue log.

7. Lastly my dragon npcs all became invisible after I packed 667 data. I would show a picture but they are invisible but they still attack me while they are invisible so its very hard to get a picture without dying.

Any help is appreciated. I will rep and thank anyone that helps out :D

If someone knows how to fix some of these but isn&#39;t willing to help me out for free, send me a private message, or post here with your Skype and I may be able to pay a little bit for the fix(es).

Thank you for the help :)</description>

              <p>The issues with the models are probably because you packed 667 data. Make sure the readvalues and etc are correct.</p>
<p>The issue with the cannon is because you packed 667 data. When you did, it replaced the cannon models. Repack the cannon models to fix that.</p>
