There&#39;s more but i&#39;ve mainly been focusing on skill goals.


[ul][*]Emote&#39;s will no longer cut out if their longer then 1 second
[*]Unweidling an Item (that you have in your inventory) won&#39;t randomly stack
[*]Item&#39;s won&#39;t go into random slots
[*]Random character nulling has been patched.
[*]Force chat now works correctly (previously for example Vengeance wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Taste vengeance!&quot;.)
[*]When talking with &quot;/&quot; in a non clanchat channel will tell you you&#39;re not in a channel and also alert you if muted.[/ul]


[ul][*]Player&#39;s were disconnecting when more then 3 people were in a region, this issue should no longer occur.
[*]Item would stack once unequipped, this dupe should no longer occur.
[*]Spam clicking (left/right) should no longer cause a nullpointer.
[*]Some item&#39;s when spawned, would show the incorrect name, this should no longer be the case (Earth Runes would say they are Cosmic Rune&#39;s when spawned).
[*]The message &quot;invalid item&quot; when trying to eat a Rocktail or similar foods should no longer occur
[*]Korasi&#39;s sword (19784) would go into helm slot, this has been fixed.[/ul]


[ul][*]A problem when opening a store, would cause a &quot;T2&quot; Erorr meaning you would instantly disconnect from the Game Server, this has now been patched.
[*]Shop&#39;s have recieved a mechanical make-over making them easier to use back-end and for the player

[*]Dragon Scimitar, Godsword, Dragon Longsword, Dragon Mace, Granite Maul, Saradomin Sword all had incorrect Special Attack requirements, animations &amp; graphics, this has now been patched accordingly.
[*]The server should no longer allow you to attempt to message someone who is no longer online, previously the server would allow you to private message someone even if they weren&#39;t online, this should no longer be the case concerning Private Messages*
[*]Previously while wielding a shield, wearing another shield would delete the item in your shield slot and not add it to your inventory and the same occurred with 2-handed swords, this glitch has been patched.[/ul]


[ul][*]Combat now goes up-to 138
[*]Summoning has been added, requires charms and Shard&#39;s to train
[*]Pouches are brought from a store.

<span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What is an Instanced Area?</span></span></p>
<p>A instanced area is where the server replicates an area of the map and moves you to there, so no-one else can enter your area, an example of this would be Fight Caves and how Pest Control can run more then one game at once.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-b">What is the purpose of an Instanced Area?</span></span></p>
<p>The purpose of an instanced area is that it prohibits people from entering your area, so you can’t get any outside help from other player’s, a lot of server’s use player Id &amp; 4 = player height, which is on some other RSPS you can see projectiles that aren’t yours, see arrow drops and items you’ve not dropped appear in fight caves.</p>
<p>So with that done, here’s the break down:</p>
<p>An instanced area for bosses will always cost (minigames do not cost anything!):</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]100,000 Coins - Solo<br>
[</em>]200,000 Coins - Clan (Clan Chat)[/ul]</p>
<p>What bosses will you be able to have your own instanced areas:</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]King Black Dragon<br>
[</em>]Dagganoth Kings<br>
[<em>]Kalphite Queen<br>
[</em>]Corpereal Beast[/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">How does the clan Instanced Areas work?</span></span></p>
<p>For someone in your Clan Chat to join your Instanced Area they will need to be a recruit or higher to join your clan’s area, meaning that guests or friends won’t be able to join your area.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to toggle in your Clan Chat settings interface, whether only the Clan Owner(s) or Generals can start instanced areas.</p>

[</em>]When talking with “/” in a non clanchat channel will tell you you’re not in a channel and also alert you if muted.[/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]Player’s were disconnecting when more then 3 people were in a region, this issue should no longer occur.<br>
[</em>]Item would stack once unequipped, this dupe should no longer occur.<br>
[<em>]Spam clicking (left/right) should no longer cause a nullpointer.<br>
[</em>]Some item’s when spawned, would show the incorrect name, this should no longer be the case (Earth Runes would say they are Cosmic Rune’s when spawned).<br>

[</em>]Korasi’s sword (19784) would go into helm slot, this has been fixed.[/ul]</p>

[*]Previously while wielding a shield, wearing another shield would delete the item in your shield slot and not add it to your inventory and the same occurred with 2-handed swords, this glitch has been patched.[/ul]</p>
<p>[ul][<em>]Combat now goes up-to 138<br>
[</em>]Summoning has been added, requires charms and Shard’s to train<br>
