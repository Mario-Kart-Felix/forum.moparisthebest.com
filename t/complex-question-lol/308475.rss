    <title>Complex Question. lol</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/complex-question-lol/308475</link>
    <description>Thread has been settled. Closed now. Don&#39;t bother posting :)

I feel so stupid having to ask a question on here. But here goes:

Im using the right click to bigindian command features. Its all working fine. But i want a message to be different depending on the player who is being right clicked&#39;s playerrights. Similar the the change in color depending on combat level. I am attempting to do this purely server side. any thoughts?

Dont try to tell me:
[code]
if(playerRights == 1) {
outStream.createFrameVarSize(104);
outStream.writeByteC(4); // command slot (does it matter which one?)
outStream.writeByteA(0); // 0 or 1; 0 if command should be placed on top in context menu
outStream.writeString(&quot;Mod&quot;);
outStream.endFrameVarSize();
}
[/code]

Because then it takes the playerrights of the CLICKER into account. Im looking to use a variation of p.playerrights but am unsure on how to set it up seeing as i cant state p = commandsubstring.</description>
