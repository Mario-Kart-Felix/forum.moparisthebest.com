    <description>Hi everyone, just a simple question:

Can anyone point me in the direction of a &quot;as close as possible&quot; private server to the current runescape? I&#39;m not really into classic and I understand development is having a difficult time with certain features that runescape has right now. I am just looking for a server that doesn&#39;t log you in with tons of gold or equipment. I actually just want to progress in the game on my free time on my computer(offline) and can&#39;t seem to find out which one is the best pick.

Well any answer is appreciated, thanks!</description>
