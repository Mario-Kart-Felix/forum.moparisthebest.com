-This page is still in progress and will be finished with the layout by tonight. I currently have things to do IRL that are far more important at the moment but I&#39;ll leave you with a picture.. 
(I&#39;m still in progress with editing the graphics.. I&#39;d like to get into slightly more detail before I can say I&#39;m happy with them.)

<p>Yeah the grass is something I didn’t draw that came frame the pokemon game or whatever, actually completely forgot to mention that.<br>
When I said 1% I didn’t mean for people to get extremely statistical about it I just meant I hadn’t drawn those lol.<br>
Thanks for the guide though I’m definitely going to attempt to follow it as best as I can, I’m extremely new to this whole ordeal.<br>
What would you suggest the inventory,chat box and all that look like? I’d kind of like to keep the grass because everything else I painted and slapped in there was pretty awful looking but I guess I’ll get to changing those now and the shape of the game frame as well has extreme issues.</p>
<p>edit - pretty much completely changed the frame and layout of the game.<br>
In my opinion looks much more appealing - I’m trying to go with a more <span class="bbcode-i">simple</span> outlook for the game.<br>
Now to get things to actually work correctly…</p>
