    <title>[c++][tutorial]Hello World (2 ways)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/c-tutorial-hello-world-2-ways/66482</link>
    <description>Welcome to my tutorial on how to write hello world in c++.

heres the simple version (has more lines):

[i][b]#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
cout &lt;&lt;&quot;Hello World \n&quot;;
cin.get();
}
[/b][/i]

ok, this is what it means:

#include &lt;iostream&gt; means to include the header iostream, which is intput stream, allowing use to make input.

using namespace std; lets us use cout, cin etc because they are std class (look at second version)

int main() if you have ever programmed, you would know that this means that main is the main variable.

{ } these open and close a statement or &quot;Function&quot;

cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Text Here&quot;;  in c++, cout is the writeln() function or java ( i think :P )

\n means newline and \ doesnt get read by the compiler

cin.get(); tells the compiler to &quot;get&quot; the cins (cout etc)

Now that you understand that write it a few times and in the next post you will read the second version.[br][size=1]Posted on: March 10, 2007, 05:05:27 PM[/size][hr]continueing..

Now, the second way to do hello world is my favorite. here it is:

[b][i]#include &lt;iostream&gt;
//Notice theres no namespace now

int main()
{
std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot; Hello World the SECOND WAY!!! \n &quot;;
}[/i][/b]

Simple, huh?

Ok to explain. 

#include is for including headers like iostream which allows output.

// and /* */ allow comments that dont get compiled

int main() is the main function

{ } close and open statements and functions.

std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot; Text Here &quot;; this is the same as cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Blah&quot;;

/n this means new line. /sdkf isnt compiled when theres n after it.


Now you know how to do hello world 2 ways!

if theres any errors then post them below.</description>
