    <description>Alright So I Found What Object I Wanted It To Be (Chest)

So I&#39;m Wanting It To Give 100k (but not every time)

I Know How To Make It Give You 100k if you have 10k in your inventory 

but i want to only make it give it to you sometimes! not every time

how do i do that?

this is what im changing

if(objectID == 2709){
if(q4 == 1 &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(983, 1)){
deleteItem(983, 1);
addItem(1550, 1);
addItem(995, 83);
sM(&quot;You find some garlic and some coins in this old treasure chest.&quot;);
}
if(q4 != 1 || !playerHasItem(983, 1)){
sM(&quot;You need a key to open this treasure chest.&quot;);
}
}

i know that i have to change it so that if you have 10k inventory it will give you 100k

and that i want to change the message ect.

but how do i make it only give you the 100k sometimes? and still delete the 10k so its a working lottery

any help would be much appreciated!</description>

              <p>It’s easy. Use misc.random. If player has 10k {</p>
<p>then make it so that you have 10 random numbers that it can pick one. 1/10 chance. If the number ends up as say 10 give 100k else sendmessage you lose</p>
