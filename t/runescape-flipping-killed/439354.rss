    <description>Due to a hidden update, Jagex have greatly impacted flipping making it less effective, here&#39;s how:


For example in the past it was: i buy 25k nats in like 2 mins and sell them 2 mins later. My limit is resetted. And i start all over again.

Now: I buy 25k nats in like 2 minutes and sell them 2 mins later. My limit is not resetted. I will have to wait 4 hours till i can flip nature runes again.

Thoughts?</description>

              <p>Lets be honest here… If removing the Grand Exchange is out of the question, then players become far too dependent on it. Removing a set price and price checker is a possibility. This way players are unsure of the price, so prices fluctuate… Which in turn wouldn’t help the economy due to high convenience of items.</p>

I will give you that one but a lot of things worked in ultima online that hasn’t in anything else. I feel this is partially due to the timing of the game and lack of casual gamers.</p>
<p>If you wanted to implement something like this in today game I think player clipping would be necessary and you would also need to have a pop limit to stores in a single area.</p>

<p>why havent you stopped playing yet is my thought<br>
[/quote]Why are you posting in the Runescape discussion is my thought</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Because I was actively involved with the game for so many years, and now that Jagex no longer owns their own company as of Jan 1st 2012, the game has taken the fastest turn I’ve ever seen. So many exclusive deals and even RWT gambling is being supported by them.<br>
[/quote]1. You must be really fucking stupid to think they do not own their company.<br>
2. Exclusive deals were around long before the US fags got involved.<br>
3. RWT Gambling was planned for a long time.</p>
<p>This is why people say you always spread bullshit, you make assumptions based on emotion and do not take your time to actually research things.[/quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Uh, Jagex lost alot of profit last year because of the bot nuke just as the US companies owned 50%+ of it when Andrew sold his shares (IIRC). Owning that much of a company means you have a say in what the company does (board of directors) so in order to make up for the upcoming loss theyre trying to milk the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They simply had bonuses for consecutive memberships. Not the xp bonuses, the recruit a friend crap, the ridiculously over stylized ingame items from buying game time, the website that even LOOKS like it would be a p2w website. Im willing to bet theyre going to shift the f2p model over to microtransactions. In fact, according to the article below, they owned the company for quite some time before it was declared. Thats the early exclusives we saw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What? I mean squeel of fortune</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Jagex owns less of their own company than the US shareholders do. And I seriously doubt the USfags care about the games community, they invested for money and theyre going to get it one way or another, they arent pulling out without a profit. Its either Jagex makes these updates or they fire workers. Capitalism just jumped really hard into an otherwise balanced company. When people who own a company begin to be swapped out with new fresh owners that are in it for finances they start to not understand their consumer market. (EA, Blizzard) And theyll pop out whatever garbage they can. “We can’t make profits this quarter :”  “Ugh, just throw in a new sword that looks so cool everyone will want it and make it only available with 2 month cards”</p>
<blockquote>Tuesday, 9th January 2001 at 3:45 pm
US firm buys control of Jagex
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Insight Venture Partners now owns 55%; R&amp;D investment pulls FY11 profits to £6.7m</span></p>
<p>A New York venture capital firm has purchased further shares in Jagex to increase its stake to <span class="bbcode-b">55 per cent</span>, effectively transferring control of the Runescape developer from the UK to the US.<br>
Financial documents seen by Develop show that Insight Venture Partners has acquired another twenty per cent of the Cambridge-based outfit. The VC firm previously acquired 35 per cent of the company in 2005.<br>
Jagex agreed to pay off £2.5 million in expenses as part of the deal – just one of many implications that Insight paid substantial sums for the equity.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">The controlling purchase was made at some stage last year but its effect on company equity has only now been declared.</span><br>
Jagex announced Insight’s investment in February last year. Jeff Horing, managing director at the investment firm, at the time said the new investment “will help accelerate” the studio’s product launches.</p>
<p>Horing, along with Insight partner Alex Crisses, both have seats on the Jagex board of directors, along with CEO Mark Gerhard and two other VC firms.<br>
It means that one of the UK games industry’s leading lights is now controlled by US investors.<br>
Gerhard is a board member of UK trade body Tiga.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">It is believed that Jagex co-founder Andrew Gower has offloaded his ownership of the company to Insight, netting millions in the process.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Jagex said it made £45.3 million in the twelve months ending March 2011, though profits after tax were at £6.7 million due to significant investment in new projects.<br>
Profits the year prior were more than double, at £13.7 million.</span><br>
The US-owned developer said it has significant reserves of cash and is investing in multiple projects.<br>
The company, currently in the process relocating within Cambridge, had about 400 employees by March 2011. It is believe that today it has significantly more.</p>

It was stupid to try and merchant prior to this, the margins were so pathetically low because anyone could undercut you at any time.</p>

<p>Because I was actively involved with the game for so many years, and now that Jagex no longer owns their own company as of Jan 1st 2012, the game has taken the fastest turn I’ve ever seen. So many exclusive deals and even RWT gambling is being supported by them.[/quote]1. You must be really fucking stupid to think they do not own their company.<br>
2. Exclusive deals were around long before the US fags got involved.<br>
3. RWT Gambling was planned for a long time.</p>
<p>This is why people say you always spread bullshit, you make assumptions based on emotion and do not take your time to actually research things.</p>
