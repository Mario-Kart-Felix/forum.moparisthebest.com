I want to see a server called deathscape. It’s basically runescape but with a twist every so often you just randomly die. Think of the difficulty here you are getting ready to complete monkey madness when all of sudden you get the message “you have died of dysentery” and find yourself in lumbridge. How often you die is random however you will not survive longer than 2 hours play time. That will make you think twice about pulling things out of the bank and force you to strategist how to manage your short timespan called life.<br>

              <p>legal issues didn’t stop rsps as a whole so that idea is still viable. I had the same idea with duels… 5$ entry per duel, 16 people per tournament, winner takes a certain percentage of the pot. rest goes into your pocket so you can f b*tches</p>
