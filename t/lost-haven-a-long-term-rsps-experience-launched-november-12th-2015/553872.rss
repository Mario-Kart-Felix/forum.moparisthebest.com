[CENTER][SIZE=6]Information[/SIZE][/CENTER]

[SIZE=3]At Lost-Haven our goal is to provide you with a server that you are able to play for weeks, if not months, without running out of objectives to complete. This means that there are slow experience rates, coins are incredibly valuable, and the game is very competitive. We have done this to ensure that you will always be intrigued by the game play, and also so that new players will be able to join the competitive action at any time. All of our updates are hand picked and chosen by the players. The worst that could happen is you do not enjoy it, so at least try it out![/SIZE]

[CENTER][SIZE=3]More media and information will be added over the course of the next week. We would have delayed posting this until then, however we would love for players to come online and suggest what they want changed or modified.[/SIZE][/CENTER]



We thank [URL=http://&quot;http://www.rune-server.org/members/swiffy/&quot;]Swiffy[/URL] for the release of [URL=http://&quot;http://www.rune-server.org/runescape-development/rs2-server/downloads/606076-ruse-release-grand-exchange-ironman-modes-extremely-stable-anti-ctf-wpe.html&quot;]Ruse[/URL], without which this would not have been a possibility. We understand there are a lot of servers using his release, however we are likely the only server with more than a few days of gameplay and frequent, quality updates.

We thank [URL=http://&quot;http://www.rune-server.org/members/dynamic/&quot;]Dynamic[/URL] for his talent with web development and all the work that he was able to do with our website in a short period of time. You can also inquire about his services [URL=http://&quot;http://www.rune-server.org/black-market/virtual-items/selling/603856-120-examples-dynamics-services-website-design-website-development-graphics.html&quot;]here[/URL].</description>
