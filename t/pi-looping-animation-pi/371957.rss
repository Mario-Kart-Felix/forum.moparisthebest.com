    <description>[B]Hey there guys, 

This base I have (posted by nintendo) is all working very smoothly, except some animations (like cutting wood, mining)  they look fine, except I click off the rock or tree and start walking, and the animation keeps on playing, I have tried many things like changing emote... try making the timer different and messed around with return;  however it doesnt seem to be working... 

I just be very grateful if you guys could share your knowledge, give me a clue or tell me whats the problem and how to fix... or how about to go fixing it :) 

BTW yeah im not pro :s  and this is sort of new to me... but respect the fact that I have tried  THANKS GUYS  :D[/B]

[B]IMPORTANT&gt; And to let you know, it loads alot of 602 and 525 animations... so I dont know if that will make a difference or not :P and to also let you know, it stops chopping logs but just carries on the anim.[/B]

<p>Make a method that resets woodcutting and have it reset your animation.</p>
