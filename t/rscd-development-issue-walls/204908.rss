    <title>RSCD Development issue - Walls</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rscd-development-issue-walls/204908</link>
    <description>Hi,

I am trying to continue development on RSCD, I have Divine PK 5.

The main problem I am having is that when a player activates the WalkToPointEvent they are able to walk straight through walls.

I have been looking at the source code for about 11 hours now and I can&#39;t find any checks to stop players walking though walls. I think that the only checks (for normal walking) are done via the client, is this correct?

Anyway, if someone can point me in the right direction that would be much appreciated, the isWalkable function looks interesting but I don&#39;t think this will help me because I believe that walls aren&#39;t covered in this?


Are there any builds where clients aren&#39;t able to walk through walls?


Sorry if I&#39;m asking stuff which has already been talked about, I did try searching the forums before I posted but couldn&#39;t find anything relevant.

Thanks

<p>If you can get your hands on RSCD V25 then you could take a look at that. I’m not sure how to dump tile information from the client.</p>

</aside>
<p>If I knew where to get it then I would :P, can’t find an active link anywhere.</p>
<p>I’m thinking about replicating the clients behaviour for the server at the moment, I assume it checks its data files (just trying to locate this in the mudclient at the moment), so it wouldn’t be too hard to upload them and have the server check aswell.</p>

<p>Edit: Got my hands on RSCD v25 code ;o, looks like there is already checking inplace for walls, tastey.</p>
