    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/2-questions-look-please-317-delta/341417</link>
    <description>Where are the hit ratios located? Well if they are located in a specific file ,I am trying to change the hit ratio for magic as its very low.
Also  how do I make it if the player has 85+ defence your chance of hitting them(with range and melee) is lower?

Will Rep++ when I can give Rep++</description>
