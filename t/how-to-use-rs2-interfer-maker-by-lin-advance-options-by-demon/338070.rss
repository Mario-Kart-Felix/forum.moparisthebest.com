Show&#39;s how to use lins interfaces and such.
I hope this help.
First tut. . .
So please, If I broke a rule, just say I&#39;ll remove.

As below someone said to put infomation about it as well, so here;(More in video)

You will download a picture, say you want a blue h&#39;ween mask for your interface.
What you would do it corp the image with teh blue h&#39;ween mask and save it from paint as &quot;bluemask.png&quot;
Then in the notepad/setting thing you would open it up and add this in it. the last number or what every number you would want it to be like this, &quot;50=bluemask&quot; and then when you go to insert a image and the number is 50, It would be a blue h&#39;ween mask:)
(Also you need to add the image to the sprites folder)
I hope this has helped.</description>
