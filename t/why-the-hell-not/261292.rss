    <description>Why not try and get flamed on mopar for asking for help on my server

Only &quot;MAJOR&quot; exploit left on kingpk is &quot;double wielding&quot; I was almost certain it had to do with the dupe method that was being used but seems fixing the dupe didn&#39;t fix the double wielding. 

So if anyone has this fix id be more the grateful

( this is the last thing i need to finish my kingpk project as im not the &quot;owner&quot; of it any longer)</description>
