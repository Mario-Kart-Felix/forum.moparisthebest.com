    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-making-my-server-work-less-slow/343824</link>
    <description>Ok, guys, i have my server online, it doesn&#39;t lag but when my character is walking it kinda stucks a bit...and that sucks..

i would like to know how to delete things that make laggy and that worth nothing like elements, or effects, but idk how... and also, i saw at config &gt; npc, that theres A LOT  of npcs, and they probably lag, but they have like an order, npc 1: ...npc 2:..., so if i delete npc 2 will that cause an error cuz im breaking the order?, please help.</description>
