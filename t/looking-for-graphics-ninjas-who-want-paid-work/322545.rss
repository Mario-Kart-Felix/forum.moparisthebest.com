    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-graphics-ninjas-who-want-paid-work/322545</link>
    <description>Hey there Moparians.

I am looking for a handful of graphic designers who want long-term paid work. You will, on most projects, be part of a group providing bespoke solutions to small businesses and individuals. Typical work would include logo design, photo manipulation to a specification and working with front-end developers to create layouts and interfaces.

You will be paid as an independent contractor (or the legal equivalent in your country) which in most cases means you&#39;ll be considered self employed and have to look after your own taxes and such. This is a per-project, not a salary-based relationship and you will have the freedom to take or leave individual projects as you are offered them. You agree that your work on our projects becomes full property of the client, and that you will also adhere to any per-project NDA-type restrictions.

Applicants must:
- Demonstrate excellent graphic design ability.
- Be of age to sign a contract in their country, or have a parent/guardian willing to read &amp; sign on their behalf.
- Be allowed to work as an independent contractor in their country.
- Be a great team player. Communicating via Skype/IM is a must - although we expect people to be able to work independantly to spec. when required, we also want human beings who will be part of the team.

To apply:
Send an email to sam@boxn.co.uk with (at least) the following information:
- Your name
- Your age
- Your country of residence
- Your skillset - what area(s) of graphic work are you into? Can you do it all? Would you be looking for layout work, logo design/vector stuff, or all of the above? ;)
- Examples of your previous work. References and live sites would be great, but screenshots and such are fine.

Hope to hear from some of you soon, I know there&#39;s some great designers on here who should be being recognized for their stuff. :)

EDIT: Forgot to mention, if you have any questions at all feel free to email sam@boxn.co.uk, I don&#39;t bite hard. :)</description>

              <p>Hey there Moparians.</p>
<p>I am looking for a handful of graphic designers who want long-term paid work. You will, on most projects, be part of a group providing bespoke solutions to small businesses and individuals. Typical work would include logo design, photo manipulation to a specification and working with front-end developers to create layouts and interfaces.</p>
<p>You will be paid as an independent contractor (or the legal equivalent in your country) which in most cases means you’ll be considered self employed and have to look after your own taxes and such. This is a per-project, not a salary-based relationship and you will have the freedom to take or leave individual projects as you are offered them. You agree that your work on our projects becomes full property of the client, and that you will also adhere to any per-project NDA-type restrictions.</p>
<p>Applicants must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate excellent graphic design ability.</li>
<li>Be of age to sign a contract in their country, or have a parent/guardian willing to read &amp; sign on their behalf.</li>
<li>Be allowed to work as an independent contractor in their country.</li>
<li>Be a great team player. Communicating via Skype/IM is a must - although we expect people to be able to work independantly to spec. when required, we also want human beings who will be part of the team.</li>
</ul>
<p>To apply:<br>
Send an email to <a href="mailto:sam@boxn.co.uk">sam@boxn.co.uk</a> with (at least) the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your age</li>
<li>Your country of residence</li>
<li>Your skillset - what area(s) of graphic work are you into? Can you do it all? Would you be looking for layout work, logo design/vector stuff, or all of the above? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:">
</li>
<li>Examples of your previous work. References and live sites would be great, but screenshots and such are fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope to hear from some of you soon, I know there’s some great designers on here who should be being recognized for their stuff. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention, if you have any questions at all feel free to email <a href="mailto:sam@boxn.co.uk">sam@boxn.co.uk</a>, I don’t bite hard. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
