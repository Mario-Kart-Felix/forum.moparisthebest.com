    <title>How do I make it so that you can&#39;t use certain items in the wilderness?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-make-it-so-that-you-cant-use-certain-items-in-the-wilderness/371413</link>
    <description>[center]In my PI server, I&#39;m making a donator set that will be have excessively good bonuses, but to keep PKing fair and balanced I would like to add a method so you can&#39;t use the items in the server, I do not have the models yet so if you need to refer to an item ID, please use hashes (#). 

My &#39;Is in wild&#39; method is
[code=java]if(inWild()) {[/code]

Would it be something like

 [code=java]if(WearID = ####) &amp;&amp; if(inWild()) {?[/code]

My base as states is Project Insanity.

I would like to make it so that if a person is wearing a single piece, or all of the donator clothing they cannot attack players in the Wild, and I would like it to send the message &quot;You cannot use this item in the wilderness.&quot;

Any help? :)
