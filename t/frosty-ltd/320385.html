<p>Well To began with, my names Goose and I’m trying to create one of the top [317] servers out there. The thing is I can only do so much.</p>
<p>So This is why i decided to get a group of individuals who are good at what they do, and try and help me create this server. I currently have a paypal with money on it for a VPS but im waiting until i have professionals in the fields that i am looking for. I want this server to be one of the servers to talk about online as one of the best. Some of the things that happen to the last server i had was it didn’t work because of the lack of maturity and commitment. Thats why i want to make a team of people that will be commited, mature and pollite.</p>
<p>I havent decided on a source yet but that will be figuered out once i assemble the team, like I said it will be whatever the team favors. We will also have a website and a vps slot and an active donation system.</p>
<p>My experience in servers is Mediocore. I have messed around with a few projects and have also owned a prety successful server known as Hellzpkerz which consisted of atleast 50-60 players a day. Although this server lasted as long as it did, im not satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<p>Ok, enough about me and my past experiences.</p>
<p>As i said before i am looking for Mature Polite and Commited individuals. Don’t bother posting an application if you are not willing to work, have bad manners and have no experience what so ever in any of the team possitions.</p>

<pre><code>						Client Designer/maker
