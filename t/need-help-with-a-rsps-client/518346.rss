    <title>Need help with a rsps client</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-a-rsps-client/518346</link>
    <description>Hey guy&#39;s so I&#39;ve been trying to run a rsps for 2 day&#39;s now and I&#39;ve been looking through all the server downloads and I have had multiple problems for all of them. None of them have I even been able to merely LOG IN to, just to try them out. But I found one that I love the source of, the pictures look like a server I used to play which I loved. So I ran the source and it&#39;s working fine but the client had the following error &quot;Error: Could not find or load main class client&quot;. Now I really love this source so I want to play this really bad and make it into a server. So can somebody please help me. I&#39;ve already looked all over the web for solutions and none of them worked. 

The download page is here:http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,633225.0.html If you wanted to test to see if it even works for you.
I&#39;m willing to screenshare through skype to make it work, please help. Thanks.</description>

              <p>Actually got a coding friend to help me XD My code looked like :<a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>

cd ./locandclass/<br>

<p>But when I made it look like this:<a class="mention" href="/u/echo">@echo</a> off<br>

color 5d<br>
cd ./locandclass/<br>
“C:/Program files (x86)/Java/jre7/bin/java.exe” -Xmx512m -cp .; client 10 0 highmem members 32<br>
pause</p>
<p>It fixed it, all I had to add was: -cp .;</p>
