    <title>Trapt - Waiting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trapt-waiting/242133</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanna meet up with you
And show you what I&#39;m thinking
I&#39;ll take you anywhere
That you wanna go
I&#39;m sitting here bored and lonely and
You know that anytime you&#39;re free
To show me how you feel
We&#39;ll take it anywhere that you want to go
Anywhere that you wanna go

And I&#39;d make it right if you wanted it
I want it back more than you know
I&#39;d cross the line if you wanted it
I want you back

And I&#39;m waiting for you
To get that feeling once again
Reunited in the end
And I&#39;ve been waiting for you
To capture my imagination
Cuz I&#39;ve been fooled by the illusions in my head
In my head

Now I realize I never had it so good
You took me anywhere I wanted to go
Now I&#39;m sitting here dreaming of the days
When anytime I wanted I could show you how I feel
I can&#39;t go anywhere that I want to go
Anywhere that I want to go

And I&#39;d make it right if you wanted it
I want it back more than you know
I&#39;d cross the line if you wanted it
I want you back

And I&#39;m waiting for you
To get that feeling once again
Reunited in the end
And I&#39;ve been waiting for you
To capture my imagination
Cuz I&#39;ve been fooled by the illusions in my head
In my head

I&#39;ll take it anywhere
I&#39;ll take it anywhere
I&#39;ll take it anywhere
I&#39;ll take you anywhere you wanna go

And I&#39;d make it right if you wanted it
I want it back more than you know
I&#39;d cross the line if you wanted it
I want you back

I&#39;m waiting for you
To get that feeling once again
Reunited in the end
I&#39;ve been waiting for you
To capture my imagination
Cuz I&#39;ve been fooled by the illusions in my head

And I&#39;ve been fooled by the illusions in my head
And I&#39;ve been fooled by the illusions in my head&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This song is the best song in my opinion, just because it has so much to deal with my life, there is so much meaning to this song. I recommend this song to anyone that is having a hard time in a relation ship ;)</description>
