    <title>Help making a new server from scratch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-making-a-new-server-from-scratch/406329</link>
    <description>so i have been messing around with these private servers for a while now and i think i want to start my own. however all of the tutorials are for older versions of rs or have nothing to them, ie just pvp areas and the rest of the world is blank. 
so i found some info on getting files from the jagex cache and i sort of understand the client mods, but where do people get the sources from? and what all is in the source? i want to make the most up to date server, with like no mods for now, but i dont know enough to start and i&#39;ve been browsing the fourms for this information all night.
how do i get new source/client?</description>

<p>Download a source and client from the server downloads section. You don’t want an up to date server, the more up to date, the harder to code.</p>

              <p>The source is written from scratch, it’s called a framework. The client you also have to write. The newest up-to-date revision right now is 654, and tbh nobody has made one and it’s been out for awhile so good luck. Unless you know java 100% ur fucked.</p>
