              <p>The Runserver/Run.bat will always say the server is Online/Running, But<br>
That is made say it, You have to Portforward correctly and Enable the port through the firewall,</p>
<p>Do those and your set to set up your own server, And if the server status said it is online,<br>
And others are connecting to your server, But you cannot with that IP, Use Your local server addresses like ‘0.0.0.0’ And ‘Localhost’, Usually server owners cannot login with their own ip, It is rare that they can login with their own IP.</p>
