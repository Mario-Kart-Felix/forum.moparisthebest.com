    <title>Java error in compile</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/java-error-in-compile/185235</link>
    <description>I have recently downloaded my friends client, and it works fine for all of his friends, but not for me. I get an error of:

&#39;javac&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file

I redownloaded java to make sure it wasn&#39;t my java, but it wasnt. It still says it. 

Oh, also, don&#39;t put just put javac quote chakaboomboom in java c in your gigadrive, i dont know what the hell that is but thats all i see for explanations, so put an easy explanation for it.

P.S: Tico&#39;s guide for java is too old,it was destroyed the topic on helping java, so don&#39;t say look there.\
