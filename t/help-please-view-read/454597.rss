    <description>Okay so... im wondering how to make it so that one item is more important than the other when it comes to which item you will keep on death? I am using torva pkz 637 source and i tried changing the market price on the item and that doesnt change anything... there has to be a file which states the priority of an item being kept on death... like: bring (i) = 1, statius platebody = 2, iron bar = 92983, where 1 is protected over 2, etc.</description>
