    <title>Can anyone recomend a base</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/can-anyone-recomend-a-base/330890</link>
    <description>    i havn&#39;t really been on recently,
jus so busy :\

   anyways, i&#39;m kinda bored atm
so i thought that i&#39;d just kill some time by running/coding a  server for a while

  sure i&#39;ve done it before, but most clients i have are technically all finished
i don&#39;t really like delta&#39;s source that he released because the folders arn&#39;t markedby &quot;class.#&quot;
    anyways,   i was thinking i might just play around with devolution for a while
if someone would be able to provide me with a link to a thred with a devo released source, then i&#39;d apreaciate it,
       i can&#39;t realy find it in &quot;search&quot; option

anyways...


   unless u can recomend some better source,

i don&#39;t want it to be entirly clean, but i don&#39;t really want any npc&#39;s around (but if they are,  it&#39;s ok too..)

       your help will be apreciated.
