    <description>Hi,

I opened MoparScape client and saw that you open items.xml by clicking on item ids in the client. I confirmed that myself by editing the xml thing and it worked :P but how do i open that thing like it opens OUT OF the client. I know that you can open it with a notepad, with excel and with a browser but i want to open it like it opens when i click on item ids :S How do i do it? I want to make it downloadable for my players but i dont want to put it in my client, i just want them to be able to open it so please could you guys tell me what to do that it seems like  on moparscape client when i open that xml file?

thanks sale</description>
