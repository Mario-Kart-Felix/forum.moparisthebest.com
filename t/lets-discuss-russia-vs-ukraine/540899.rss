<p>you don’t know very much about Ukraine if you think the Russian population is small[/quote]Their <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080323110131/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/nationality/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">2001 consensus</a> yielded: 77.8% Ukrainian, 17.3% Russian (I doubt it fluctuated too much, the proportions are probably still similar - in fact the figures note that the Russian populate dropped from 1989 to 2001 so we could assume the trend continues). They are a relatively small percentile of the nation, so 17% of the population being Russian hardly justifies a Russian takeover of the state. That said, all Russians aren’t nationalists, and certainly not pro-Putin, the same could be said for the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>ps Never claimed to know very much about Ukraine.</p>

              <p>We’re in the era following the atomic age (assuming you believe it is over), if war happens both sides will ultimately lose. I think Russia is just testing the commitment of the Western powers, as far as ‘protecting’ the Balkan nations goes, they want to know if they can invade them without expecting resistance. They have been threatened so far but no solid action has been taken which will only bolster their ego. I think the chances of a full-scale war happening is very unlikely (I certainly hope it is).</p>
<p>[quote=“Newty, post:3, topic:540899”]Putin is proving that Russia is still a power rival to the U.S as far as the sphere of power in Europe is concerned. He is basically saying fudge you to the entire western world right now which is either very brave… or very stupid. Only time will tell to be honest.[/quote]I think he didn’t have to prove anything, we all know the strength of mother Russia.</p>
<p>[quote=“gravenfire23, post:2, topic:540899”]I’ve been following this for a few days now, I find it interesting that a lot of the Ukrainians seem to welcome Russia’s invasion. Although as far as I can tell the only reason they want to take over the Ukraine is something to do with increasing there stance in the natural gas industry, which to me seems a bit 19th century. But then again I don’t know much about politics or anything to do with things like this.[/quote]They are attempting to make up for lost territory and using the excuse of the small fraction of pro-Russians to accomplish it. Assuming the media is portraying the public consensus accurately, only the majority of the East is siding with Russia which could be due to the historic ties of Ukraine and Russia (ie Ukrainian soldiers fighting side by side with the Soviets in WW2).</p>
