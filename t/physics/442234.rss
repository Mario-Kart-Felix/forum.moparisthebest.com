    <description>I don&#39;t know how many of you are into the scientific community, I would hope at least one of you reads up on it. If so, does anyone know anything about M-Theory? I have been studying this recently, as well as Einstein&#39;s theory of Relativity.</description>

<p>I took chemistry a year early, thinking I would like it. Then, I talked to my chemistry teacher about physics and fell in love with it. Its as if when I read physics, all of my drama’s go away and I only focus on physics.</p>

<p>I’ve always loved Science in a general subject and anything about it. Physics is just one of those topics that people shy away from because it’s intimidating in the high school/college environment. Same thing goes with chemistry.</p>

<p>Quantum physics is 99% theoretical, and there happen to be an infinite number of theories out there. I think we have to completely scrap classic physics in order to have any chance at fully understand quantum physics.</p>

</aside>
<p>I don’t like the standard S-Theory, because to solve many problems in physic’s we need a TOE (Theory of Everything), in order to do that. We need a GUT (Grand Unified Theory), this theory has parts that contradict string theory. Now, M-Theory, I believe it doesn’t screw up GUT. I’m not 100% sure, but I believe I heard that somewhere.</p>

</aside>
<p>bbycakes, I’m going to put it quite simply . Moparscape when it comes to rules is worse than a 5 year olds rules… I was just pointing out that its simply <span class="bbcode-b">very unfair</span>. Also, staff interpretating rules how they see fit does not mean they  aren’t repremandable for breaking the rules. I can interpretate the rules how I like and I’ll still get a mute, so Bebes statement was poorly worded. The rules are like guide lines? Well guide lines carry no force, why have people recieved mutes etc then if they are merely guide lines o.o.<br>
And + “shouldn’t be looking for loopholes” is silly, saying people shouldn’t look for flaws with the system is like saying please don’t look at my chest area cause I have nice boobies(i just wanted to say that tbfh, no idea how that ties into what I’m talking about).<br>

<p>to be fair this is all coming from the thread about the kid asking for rep and then the mods jumped in to derep him, david already said in that thread that they were going to reset his rep otherwise anyways.[/quote]<br>
no its not, theres multiple things. the latest one would be tahorak calling a silly person a “retard” along with a rude statement made towards the individual.</p>

<p>to be fair this is all coming from the thread about the kid asking for rep and then the mods jumped in to derep him, david already said in that thread that they were going to reset his rep otherwise anyways.</p>
