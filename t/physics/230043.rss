    <description>a concrete block of cross sectional are 0.01m^2 is crushed whena force of 1MN is applied to it. Show that its breaking stress is (a) 100MN^-2 (b)100N mm^-2

Is it A by it being 100MN^-2 which moves the decemial place back two spaces which equals 1MN?
the second part states:
reacalling that 1kg weighs about 10N also show that the block can support 100,000kg
this would mean that 1MN must be = to 100,000,000 N right? or wrong?</description>
