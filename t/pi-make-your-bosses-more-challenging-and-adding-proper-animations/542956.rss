    <title>[PI] Make Your Bosses More Challenging And Adding Proper Animations</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-make-your-bosses-more-challenging-and-adding-proper-animations/542956</link>
    <description>This is a very basic form of a snippet and it&#39;s intention is to get most of the PI servers out there to change their bosses&#39; attack styles so that a player cannot simply use prayer and deflect any damage the boss would deal. The other portion is to encourage users to add the correct animations to their bosses so that they combat is not all glitchy and pieces of the NPC&#39;s body aren&#39;t flying everywhere.

This is done fairly easily and it can be changed to do all types of things.



[SPOILER=Changing/Adding Attack Styles:]Step One: Open up NPCHandler.java (located in /npcs/)


Search for the following code:
[code]public void loadSpell(int i) {[/code]

Below
[code]switch(npcs[i].npcType) {[/code]

Add the following code:

[code]
case NPCID:
if (goodDistance(npcs[i].absX, npcs[i].absY, Server.playerHandler.players[npcs[i].killerId].absX, Server.playerHandler.players[npcs[i].killerId].absY, 2))
r3 = Misc.random(2);
if (r3 == 0) {
npcs[i].attackType = 0;
}
if (r3 == 1) {
npcs[i].attackType = 1;
npcs[i].projectileId = RANGEDGFX;
}
if (r3 == 2) {
npcs[i].attackType = 2;
npcs[i].projectileId = MAGEPROJECTILEGFX;
n.endGfx = MAGEHITGFX;
}
break;
[/code]
Now to break down the basic above code, 
[code]if (goodDistance(npcs[i].absX, npcs[i].absY, Server.playerHandler.players[npcs[i].killerId].absX, Server.playerHandler.players[npcs[i].killerId].absY, 2))[/code]
Ensures that the player and NPC have a good enough distance to attack, this is important because otherwise they can attack from very far distances.

[code]r3 = Misc.random(2);[/code]
This is what rolls to see what combat-style to use, depending on the NPC you are using you can change it to 1 (if the NPC only uses 2 styles), 2 (if the NPC uses all 3), or 0 (if the NPC uses only 1). Remember 2 is 3 options because the code counts 0,1,2.

[code]if (r3 == 0) {[/code]
This basically says that if the above roll lands on zero the code below (stopping at the end bracket) will run.

[code]npcs[i].attackType = 0;[/code]
This is the NPC&#39;s combat-style, 0 is Melee, 1 is Ranged, 2 is Magic.

[code]npcs[i].projectileId = RANGEDGFX;[/code]
This would be when the user gets attacked by the NPC and it uses a Ranged attack the type of projectile (arrow, dart, etc.) will be shown.

[code]npcs[i].projectileId = MAGEPROJECTILEGFX;
n.endGfx = MAGEHITGFX;[/code]
These two work hand-in-hand as the projectile is the spell that flys through the air towards the player, and the hit is the explosion (or graphic) that occurs when it does hit the player.

This is just a basic explanation but with the above methods you would be able to apply this to make a boss only use 1 type of attack style (besides Melee as it is default), or add another type of attack method to give your bosses a fair chance against highly-armoured players.

Other things that can be used in this method:
NPC text when using a certain combat style: [code]npcs[i].forceChat(&quot;DIE!&quot;);[/code]
Healing effect to the NPC when using a certain combat style: Not posting my example :P
Many other things you can do with this, it&#39;s overall good to use to make the server look more sophisticated. 
[/SPOILER]

[SPOILER=Adding Proper/Different Animations To Bosses]
Step One: Open EmoteHandler.java (located in /npcs/)

Search: 
[code]switch (Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].npcType) {[/code]

Underneath Add:
[code]
case NPCID:
dead = DEATHEMOTE;
attack = ATTACKEMOTE;
break;
[/code]
That is the basic form used for adding animations to NPCs&#39; that use only one combat style, it&#39;s pretty self explanatory.

[code]dead = DEATHEMOTE;[/code]
Handles the emote the NPC does when he dies.

[code]attack = ATTACKEMOTE;[/code]
Handles the emote the NPC does when he attacks.

You will need to find a list (of NPC animations) to be able to add to all of the NPCs&#39;, only one I know of personally is this: [url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/em63wvrjtxakzgs/NPC_Details.txt]https://www.dropbox.com/s/em63wvrjtxakzgs/NPC_Details.txt[/url]
(Use the above file, and type ::pnpc NPCID, while the NPC do the animation ID it has listed for it, but try +1, or -1, and so on, eventually you&#39;ll find the animations).

Next I will show you how to add multiple attack animations if your NPC is using multiple combat-styles.

The code you will use:
[code]
case NPCID:
if (Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].attackType == 1) {
attack = MELEEANIMATION;
}
if (Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].attackType == 2) {
attack = RANGEDANIMATION;
}
if (Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].attackType == 3) {
attack = MAGICANIMATION;
}
dead = DEATHEMOTE;
break;
[/code]
Now seeing this makes it a little easier to understand,
[code]if (Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].attackType == 1) {[/code]
This is checking to see if the combat-style the NPC is using is Melee if it is, it uses the attack animation listed below it.

[code]if (Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].attackType == 2) {[/code]
This does the same as above but for Ranged.

[code]if (Server.npcHandler.npcs[i].attackType == 3) {[/code]
Same with this, but for Magic.

[code]dead = DEATHEMOTE;[/code]
This was discussed above but this is for when the NPC dies.

Now remember you have to add different attacks in NPCHandler.java FIRST, then you can add the animations for the different styles here.
[/SPOILER]

Thanks guys, I understand this might not be a huge snippet but hopefully it&#39;ll help new learners catch on a little faster.</description>
