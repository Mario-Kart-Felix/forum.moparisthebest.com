    <title>Just wondering where to post this</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/just-wondering-where-to-post-this/400039</link>
    <description>Well the new game the T&amp;S Game Creations and I have been developing is finally up and running. Its beta mode of course but still really fun. Well its a COD type game so far it has one game mode, FFA (Free For All), but is a work in progress. To get to the point the team and I decided that we would release the full project so that others can make their own private server/clients. We were just going to post this in the General Programming section, but were wondering if we could post it in the Server Downloads Section. The source is completely detailed and explains every bit of code to help those that dont understand programming very well.</description>
