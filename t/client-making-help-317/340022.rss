    <description>I&#39;m making a client and i came pretty far...

but now i want the looks and stuff...

i saw on other clients that you can add text colours in game... i heard you need to do something in client.java
but i cant find out what and how.... something with 0xFF0000 (thats red and i want that colour)

second thing is:
i got those old runescape loginbox and buttons...

i searched in the sprites but i cant find them to add some stuff to it you know...
so i searched in the Gui and Client.java and the only thing that i found something related to it is this:

[code]Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1_966 = new Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1(aClass44_1053, &quot;titlebox&quot;, 0);
        if(i &lt;= 0)
            aBoolean1231 = !aBoolean1231;
        aClass30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1_967 = new Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub1(aClass44_1053, &quot;titlebutton&quot;, 0);
        aClass30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub2Array1152 = new Class30_Sub2_Sub1_Sub2[12];
        int j = 0;
        try[/code]

so idk wtf i should do with this (i found it in the client.java)

anyways i looked in every file that is possible to find that original loginbox PNG
but i dont find it.

so were do i find it to change it?


and why dont you guys make a tut out of this?
most people are wondering how to do this.

well i hope you guys can help me out :)

greetz,
