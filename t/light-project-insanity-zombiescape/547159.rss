What I&#39;ve done so far:
[SPOILER=Click]
[SERVER]
-World pvp
-No combat requirement to engage in pvp
-Random spawn location around free to play zone
-Hunger and Thirst timers and Cooldown
-Food and Water to restore hunger and thirst -buckets of water(5) it can be refill on every sink,well or water canisters
-Zombies from low to high level
-Zombies random drops and constant drops
-Zombies kill counts + zombies point reward
-Zombies have random attack styles: melee and mage(more like a vomit effect)
-Full Global Items spawns: tools,armors,weapons,magic,staffs
-Wild life animals that provide meat,bones and starter drop items
-There will be no bank access - YOU DIE EVERYTHING IS GONE!
-Shops: Vote Shop,Bandit Shop, Zombie Killer shop and Skill Capes
-No instant level up combat
-No mini games
-Clipped Npcs
-Clipped Follow + Dance follow
-Clipped Melee
-No Clipped magic and range
-Doors System improved but not even perfect, just dose the job.....
-Most of Dupes Fixed..... Glad to see new ways that player might find  bugs so I can fix,remove or crash them.

[CLIENT]
-custom interface
-cache download and download cache delete
-encryption log in
-scroll wheel mouse click 3 moves the camera around
-custom hunger,thirst and server name interface
-custom button that changes the spell book
-old school prayers only, no soul split.
-light as possible cache(this is the best i can do at the moment)
-tweaks on the code itself for better handling

[Note: this are the only modifications i brought to the source and the client. Other features that are in the source are crap and are in the stage you will see in the pictures and video bellow. Will improve in future.
[/SPOILER]

Welcome to my Runescape Project Insanity, first of all I will like to thank you for taking the time reading my topic &quot;Work in progress&quot;. 
I know that project insanity is not a good stable base, but I find it more easy for me to learn as much as I can with this source and project. I did some mistakes in hosting leeched sources back in the day and I&#39;m not proud. 

The main purpose of the game is in the following order:
-Survive as much as possible
-Survive the Thirst and Hunger System
-Survive the Zombies
-Survive the Bandits or other players

The back bone of the server will be: IF YOU DIE YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR ITEMS. But coming back and kill those bandits,players will give you a more meaning in survival and taking better actions. Most of the items are easy to regain and put you throw a new life time.

Games that inspired me to make this project:
-Dayz Mod
-Dayz Standalone
-Rune-Z
-H1Z1

If you will see the direction of the project and think you can give me some directions or simple suggestion I WILL LISTEN. Feel free to post if you like or dislike my project. I will answer all my private messages from now regarding the project, upcoming updates and alpha testing. 

Future News: [COLOR=&quot;#00FF00&quot;]10/08/2014[/COLOR]
-Global drops on the free to play zone
-More random re-spawns
-Zombies on the free to play zone
-Tweaks on the reward system
-Tweaks on the drops table
-More survival items to help

              <p>To save time I am going to do a full disclaimer that everything I am saying is based on MY opinion, so take what I say with however much seriousness you wish.</p>
<p>The PK system has always been something all PvP enabled games have had trouble with. You need to find the right balance between what is fun PvP and what is “F this server, everyone just pks”. Safe zones in the major cities is a must. Players need a place to log out and trade without being jumped on sight. You also want players to have a location that they can be civil and enjoy their time with other players on the server.</p>
<p>No banking is stupid. Even in real life people are going to store things to keep them safe from other players and be able to stockpile. By doing that you’re limiting players ability to skill, hold food, and pretty much everything else, and odds are that will get really old quickly. I don’t care if you need to call it “stashing” or “hiding” your items, shoot you can give rocks a “bank” option and make it immersive, it doesn’t matter so long as you give players the ability to store things.</p>
<p>Using the Castlewars barricades and incorporating Zombies trying to break them down to get into cities or other areas would make it way more fun and would require players to do upkeep for the city to keep it safe. Maybe 5 logs = 1 barricade, and the higher the tier of wood, the higher HP the barricade has?</p>
