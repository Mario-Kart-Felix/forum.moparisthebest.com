    <title>Two new Afelhem screenshots</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/two-new-afelhem-screenshots/2167</link>
    <description>Alright, first of all:

For those unaware, this is a game me and another person are making. The screenshots have a habbit of turning up dark on some computers, however keep in mind that my eyes are sore so I turned my contrast down to 50, so I kinda designed these too bright because I forgot my contrast was down, lol. They might look better if you turn down your monitor&#39;s contrast.

Also, these are un-finished and not official. This is just part of the next beta I am working on at the moment. There is still a lot of work to be done. In the next few weeks I should have around 10 finished screenshots ready. 

Comments are welcomed, but keep in mind these are really unfinished. Enjoy :)

This one below looks better with a contrast around 50-60, you&#39;ll get a better shadow effect. I&#39;ll fix this later because like I said I forgot my contrast was down low lol.

I noticed they had the same textures, can someone tell me if they have toque, are these default textures? Because if they are then I&#39;ll end up getting 500 people telling me Im using torue or something, because the same thing happened when I stole textures from realmcrafter.</description>

<p>Click the link in my sig to find out about the game. Ignore the mess on the site, it hasnt been updated in ages. </p>
<p>What generates the graphics? Im a little confused what you mean by "generate" but to create terrains were using a program called T.Ed to model the terrains, we use it to make a heightmap, and then we have a little app to turn the heightmap into a single .b3d model with exactly 9000 polygons(this avoding the many thousands more that T.Ed gives you). Im thinking about buying Mapcrafter to make the terrains, because you can add objects into it which would save me hours of work finding the X,Y,Z posistions. The game is coded in blitz3d, and fyi a portion of our engine is stolen from someone named ckob(who has an opensource mmorpg engine, although its a little crappy). The game is fantasy, your basic crappy mmorpg that makes kids get addicted and mindless.</p>

<p>hmm makes people addicted and mindless... Kinda reminds me of this game I played one time...</p>
