    <description>[center][b]InfinitePK is back online![/b][/center]

I&#39;d like to sincerely apologize for the recent down time of our server, we were under DDoS attacks so we had to change servers. We were previously hosted on a VPS, and even on very basic VPS hosting we managed to maintain a high level of uptime and minimum server lag throughout attacks, so we&#39;re quite confident with our new dedicated hosting and would like to invite you once more to come join us!

The server has launched very recently today before this post, so you&#39;ve got a chance to be among the top players straight away within your first couple of days played!

[center][b]Here&#39;s some Screenshots with a little info about them:[/b][/center]
