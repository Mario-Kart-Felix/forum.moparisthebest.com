My problem is that all my shops show that infinite sign circled in red I put this thread here in Client Help because I know that that infinity sign is packed into the cache or something like that I just don&#39;t know how to remove it and put it back to showing the current amount of items in a shop. If someone could help me with this it would mean the world to me, thanks!!!</description>
