              <p>all shops are in ‘shops.cfg’. Have a look in there and find the item ID that you want to search for. All item ids will be in ‘Item.cfg’.</p>
<p>Note: This is for 377’s that are PI’s or Delta or Allstar sources… 508’s im not sure where the shop ids are lol.</p>
<p>If you wana know the location of a shop ON SERVER then find the NPC id of that shop and find where he is spawned then tele there and there is that shop</p>
