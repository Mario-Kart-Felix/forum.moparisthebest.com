    <title>Please can we all move on</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/please-can-we-all-move-on/227986</link>
    <description>i am afraid to say we all need to move on from our fun times on 317&#39;s and stuff...


we need to start using and coding 503&#39;s and 508&#39;s.

this is a chance to code the latest runescape stuff. and atm the coding for these is very basic. only 20% range has been acheived and pprobably less then 10% mage.

so if every1 moved onto these then we could all benefit from it.


+ it is teh closes to runescape that this community has ever had.</description>

<p>First of all, you should calm down.</p>
<p>Second, Do you have any idea how annoying it is when you’re looking for some help in the tutorial section, and you keep looking and then you come across a lot of topics that are just saying things like</p>
<blockquote>OMG, FUCK THIS SITE, GO TO MY SITE AT..</blockquote>
<p>Do you have any idea how frustrating that is?  That’s probably the leading cause of ‘Flame’ on these forums.</p>
