    <description>Hello everyone! Me again  :rolleyes:
Source and client: [PwnScape]
Now, for my first problem (I will list them)

1. Currently I have small trouble. I would like to make a player have a certain amout of item&#39;s worth on them to enter a specific portal.
How could I do this?
PORTAL CODE:
[code]	if (objectID == 4151)
	{

                if(combatLevel &gt;= 97 &amp;&amp; combatLevel &lt;= 126)
                {
                talk(&quot;You have entered High Level Bounty Hunter!&quot;, 1780);
                sM(&quot;Beware! Other players can attack you!&quot;);
		toX = 2709;
		toY = 9471;
                }else{
                sM(&quot;You need to be level 97-126 to enter High Level Bounty Hunter!&quot;);
                }
	}[/code]
	
2. Now currrently, I&#39;d like to create a few custom skill cape emotes, if someone could show me the code or an example on what to right to make so that the player must be wearing that cape to do a emote and do the emote that corresponds to the cape. Also to make so that if they aren&#39;t wearing the cape it sends a message. e.g [code]sM(&quot;You must have a skillcape to do this emote!&quot;)[/code]

WHAT TO ADD UNDER THIS?:
[code]case 74077:
				
					c.sM(&quot;Skillcape emotes currently are unavabile&quot;);
				break;[/code]</description>

              <p>Also I think I may have the skillcape sorted out but I don’t want to leave out those “}” and "{"s<br>
So here’s my idea if it won’t work in your opinion post please.</p>
<p><code>if (playerEquipment[playerCape] == 2680) {
c.setAnimation(###);

sM("You must be wearing a skillcape to perform an emote!");
       }
}</code>[br][br][size=1]Posted on: July 22, 2009, 06:26:57 pm[/size][hr]Hm Thanks rich, but I was looking for the worth of the items the player has on him/her not money.<br>
Thanks as well _™<br>
But maybe since it may be a bit advanced I’ll move on to it later. If there’s a way to make sure the player is wearing 4 items could you post a solution please?</p>

I mean the player must have say, 6 Mil in items to enter.<br>
