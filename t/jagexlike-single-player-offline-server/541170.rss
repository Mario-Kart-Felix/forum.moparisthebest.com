    <title>Jagexlike - single player offline server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jagexlike-single-player-offline-server/541170</link>
    <description>Hi all,
I&#39;m new here and have read some posts in order to get a feel for it.
Plus I looked at other forums but couldn&#39;t really make a sense of all those numbers, 718, 472 or whatever.

I downloaded v3.2 with Aryan, installed it ok and started playing.

I found that (correct me if I&#39;m wrong)
1) you char starts maxed out &amp; no customization nor tutorial
2) no save (you start fresh every time)
3) no fullscreen mode that I could find?
4) can&#39;t open doors

I am currently emulating WoW 3.3.5a with a Blizzlike server (TrinityCore), and was wondering if there&#39;s anything of that sort for Runescape 2, I mean something you can play single-player, offline, which allows you to create a character and play with it just like retail.
Is there anything like that around?
Thx in advance</description>

              <p>Ok, thanks.<br>
I think I got a feel for it.<br>
Now I’ll start trying the stuff you suggested.<br>
Much appreciated.</p>

I’m playing single player offline WoW WoTLK and got one char to 80 and the other 4-5 (can’t remember well) are all between 62 and 72, all that without cheating, so I kinda like single player (MMO)RPGs (well, not really massive, nor multiplayer, nor online anymore…), even though not being able to do instances in WoW sucks… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

              <p>Hexium 2012 remake just google it, or search Mentios 2011. By the way, 718 is the revision. 317 being like 07 scape or before and so forth 525 is like 2008-2009, 562 is like a 2010, 614-639 is like 2011 and 718 being 2013 pre-eoc., 742 being the latest pre-eoc (I think), and stuff after that is eoc.</p>

What you want is to download the most advanced 2006 RS remake you can find through the links posted above… then run it yourself and connect through localhost to play by yourself… Btw this would make it closest to RS07 as possible not RS3</p>
