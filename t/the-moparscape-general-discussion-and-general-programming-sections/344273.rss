    <title>The Moparscape General Discussion and General Programming Sections</title>

    <description>Will be back later.

I was attempting to move the sections from the bottom of the Moparscape forums to the top, so that they would appear right below the announcements section. This didn&#39;t work out as planned (although I did expect it to work given the circumstances), so the sections are currently unavailable. They should be back tomorrow.

My apologies to anyone who makes use of those sections.</description>
