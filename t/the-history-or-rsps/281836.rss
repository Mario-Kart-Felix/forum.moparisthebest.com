    <title>The History or RSPS!?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-history-or-rsps/281836</link>
    <description>Well i think Runescape private servers are slowly going to die, i have my reason&#39;s i cant be botherd to explain each one but im going to make a list on whats happening and whats gona happen


RuneScape Private Servers wont be here for very long.

[b]As you all know back 3 years ago know one knew what RSPS was? there was only Blake and a few coders, we all used WL..[/b]


Now we have things like delta, silabs, etc.. Yeh, there all based of WL, but are ruined i think .which is good but if you understand in the long run.


Servers are not what they are today like they where 1 year back, now 80% of the community are making them? more people are figuring that making there own server is better then playing a server..? so what does that leave us with? our servers are getting empty by the day? more people are making servers more people are buying VPS then ever.

Last year there where like only 6 servers which where 24-7, know look on the status page, you get 5 pages of servers on VPS and 100% uptime, theres just not enough people to play on our servers, they decide to make their own instead..


Well i want you guys to discuss about this, if you agree with me or not.</description>

I do believe that the progressive development boom that was occurring during the birth of WinterLove is no longer in existence today - there is only so much people can code to a server, and it has all already been done (with crappy code that makes winterlove crash, but still). I think it will take something big to reincarnate the original excitement we all had during the birth of our community, we have reached our bright future, and it is not bright because we have taken shortcuts along the way. It will take some huge revolutionary community project to get us rolling back to the speed (or even faster) that we were previously at.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>I agree with you[/quote]</p>
<p>Then why dont we do one?<br>
WE have the tools that drop box program is rather helpful<br>
A lot of us have the skill<br>
And we have the power and the time. The only thing is we would have to carefully pick the people involved. Also the server would have to be released into the public at the end which I guess is why most people wouldnt do it.</p>

1 hour later i see a client called “silab”,i read about it and<br>
it was a client that had the models for the new items…</p>
<p>so i downloaded it with my slow computer!yay!..wait NO!<br>
so then i logged in and spawn a attack cape and hood and<br>
then was amazed omfg holy sh–</p>
<p>2 days later,silab was popular<br>
2 weeks later silab was VERY well known<br>
2 months later,80% of servers had silab items<br>
1 year later deltascape sources came,more models<br>
more items…so on,<br>
2 months later MORE AND MORE DELTA</p>
<p>2009+ delta was overused,no more old servers<br>
no more object training <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"><br>
delta was leeched,80%of servers used it to much<br>
and so on…<br>
still leeched servers…</p>
<p>Really look whats happened people…<br>
It was silabs fault 0.0…[/quote]No more objects training? Ever heard of Back to Basics? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> My server base.</p>
<p>Anyway, no, they won’t die. Face it; they’ve been around for 3 years and are only getting bigger. There’s many other communities out there that have more going on than MoparScape.</p>

              <p>I do believe that the progressive development boom that was occurring during the birth of WinterLove is no longer in existence today - there is only so much people can code to a server, and it has all already been done (with crappy code that makes winterlove crash, but still). I think it will take something big to reincarnate the original excitement we all had during the birth of our community, we have reached our bright future, and it is not bright because we have taken shortcuts along the way. It will take some huge revolutionary community project to get us rolling back to the speed (or even faster) that we were previously at.</p>
