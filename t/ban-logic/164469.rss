    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;We have reviewed your account, and have decided to not grant your appeal. You have continued to break our rules, time and time again, and due to the severity of these offences as well as your attitude within RuneScape, we have decided that your account will remain permanently banned.

Any messages sent regarding this account will be ignored, and we ask that you re-read all of the rules if you wish to create another account.

RuneScape Customer Support&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which is strange because....

&lt;blockquote&gt;29-Oct-2006 	Breaking Rule 7 	Apology Made 	Info 	View Evidence&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Is the ONLY offense, so, either Jagex employees cannot count/nor spell(offenses, not &quot;offences&quot;), or they have an automated bot that simply denies ALL appeals except for a few key words which are only known to them.

These are merely generalizations about their system, plainly put, I believe Jagex to be a hack it up cron job as far as actual customer support/appeal process goes. I severely doubt a &quot;person&quot; ever reviews the case.

This is not a ban topic, this is a discussion on how to circumvent the ban logics... We know already that the &quot;unban&quot; is automated, [b]suicide[/b] was a previous keyword.

So, has anyone found any new keywords or would care to share possible keywords?</description>

I like to appoint messages to Mod Gabriel, for she seems to be at least a bit intelligent. I’ve had many discussions with her in the past and is one of the only J Mods I don’t dislike.

<p>You know this is a British company right?<br>
Offence is correct in most English speaking countries such as Canada, but not in the USA of course… :rolleyes:<br>

<p>Well, to the contrary of the first sentence of yours, there was a bug that worked for all of like one or two weeks where you could simply put “suicide” in the appeal box, hit enter. And you’d be unbanned for a couple of days, just long enough to pull off your “10 phat sets”, and other duped items.</p>
<p>Edit: I know for sure I read something back in RSC, when the “blackmark” system was being developed, that stated some prevalent information on its internal cogs… However the only sentence I can remember from the post was something like “3 blackmarks is an automatic ban” or something like that.</p>
