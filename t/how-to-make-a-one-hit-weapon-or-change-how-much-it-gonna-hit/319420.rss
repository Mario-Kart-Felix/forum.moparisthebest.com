    <title>How to make a one hit weapon or change how much it gonna hit :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-make-a-one-hit-weapon-or-change-how-much-it-gonna-hit/319420</link>
    <description>servers tested on: czar, WILL WORK IN EVERY BASE EVEN DELTA!
Difficulty: 1/10        3/10 to a nub
Files what you need to use: item.cfg

1.OK
now find item.cfg it will be in the straight up server folder in czar.
it may be in a folder called config
P.S.
IT IS NOT ITEM.JAVA!OR ITEMS.JAVA OR ITEMS.CFG IT IS ITEM.CFG

2.next,
NOW,
search for the weapon(spaces are _ in the item names if you cant find it with _ substituting spaces then try with spaces but default is _ for spaces for the items)(anything except shields or arrows[some server it might be more than just shields and arrows but those are usual ones]) you want to be a 1 hit weapon, you will see something like this

[code]item = *item id number*    *item_name*   *description*.    39213.7902573678    39213.7902573678    50939.6721907541    55    55    55    0    0    5    5    5    5    5    60    0
[/code]
ok in between the *&#39;s like

*item id number*

that obviously means the item id number and the item name is ovbviously the item name etc. but the numbers is what matters don&#39;t mess with the first three numbers you know the long ones

[code] 39213.7902573678

39213.7902573678

50939.6721907541[/code]

those are store prices(buying then selling prices) and then alching(how much you would get from it if you alched it)
the numbers after...

[code]    55    55    55    0    0    5    5    5    5    5    60    0[/code]

are how much extra bonus it gives you when you wear it
so change each number to a high number like if it&#39;s 55 make it 2000000 and put for every number for that certain item(weapon, ring, etc.)
BTW DON&#39;T USE SPACES IN CASE YOU DELETE TO MUCH AND HAVE TO MAP THE CODES OUT AGAIN ALWAYS USE TABS INSTEAD OF SPACES WHERE YOU WOULD USE SPACES TO SEPARATE THE CODES LIKE 55 55 55 0 0 USE TABS FOR SPACES!

3.OK
COMPILE AND RESTART SERVER!(optional but you should get into a habit of doing that)
