    <description>I was thinking about putting together the RS 2012 site. I dont mean using httrack and screaming I stole their site, I mean actually putting effort into it, creating admin page, login system, report, etc. 
Do you think its even worth my time? Will other users want it?
I could do it for just myself to learn but if others wanted it &quot;to learn&quot; then I would release it.</description>

<p>I could do it in about an hour, I have a release of the late 2011 website already, but if you think that users will benefit from it, go for it. You should create an SMF theme to match runescape forums, and pair them. Then, I’d be surprised.<br>

<p>Not very long anyways.</p>
<p>This is the only area of the website where I can actually give back and I’m about out of ideas. I’m working on a new admin page for the last project I released. After I’m done with that I’ll be clueless on what to do.</p>
