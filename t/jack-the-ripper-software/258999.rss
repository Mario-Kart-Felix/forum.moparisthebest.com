    <title>Jack the Ripper Software</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/jack-the-ripper-software/258999</link>
    <description>Its this software i heard about from this workshop thats near my house. The workshop has docks all over the place and you plug in you ipod and it downloads as much as it possibly can from itunes for free. From a-z it just downloads everything and whacks it on there until its full up. I was googling this software and cant find much about it.  But i was curious when my dad came home from work his ipod classic and suddenly all of the memory is full up with songs in perfect alphabetical order. It wasn&#39;t even just songs there was films as well so i was wondering if anyone knows anything about this or is just something they themselves have developed. Any help would be good ive tried googling alot and come up with nothing.</description>
