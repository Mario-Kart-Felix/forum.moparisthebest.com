    <title>[RESOLVED - IN PROGRESS]Different layout?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/resolved-in-progress-different-layout/531480</link>
    <description>The homepage looks neat, the mobile theme looks good, but in general it looks really bland, like the whole thing.

I think they should change the appearance of it, and maybe add an introduction section, and that might bring more traffic to the site.

Because right now every post looks really boring, and the forum theme also looks bland.

(E.G. maybe making more colors for names, or just more than just text, starts, and occasionally an icon for every post)</description>

              <p>The problem with colours, advertisements and icons is it draws attention away from the post. This community has a mature user base (for the most part), we want to open a thread and have the post there ready to read without having to find it beneath the ads and the signatures. We don’t have time for that, we’ve other things to do and a short amount of time to do it. The simplicity of the forum makes the forum how it is, without its simplicity it would succumb to adolescent showboating.</p>

i really didn’t like all the side advertisments that fill up RL and R-S it just makes navigating very frustrating for me<br>

<p>I like rune-servers layout better with adblock, the posts look better, because they have different things for post amount, and it shows thanks, rep ect.[/quote]</p>
<p>To bad most of those things are abused heavily. As for the posts look better please elaborate because I could say our posts look better because they’re not bogged down by massive signatures and ugly text for the persons name.</p>
