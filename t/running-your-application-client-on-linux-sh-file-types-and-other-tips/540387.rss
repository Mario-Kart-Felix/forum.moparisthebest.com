    <title>Running your application/client on Linux (.sh file types) and other tips</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/running-your-application-client-on-linux-sh-file-types-and-other-tips/540387</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve seen many people making servers etc., but their clients do not run on Linux. This is due to many things e.g. cache directory or other files pointing to directories such as C:/ (which is not a valid directory on Linux). The same would apply for Mac.

To make a .sh file is easy:

Open your text editor (notepad, gedit blah blah) 
and type/use the following:
[code=sh]
#!/bin/sh
echo &quot;Starting...&quot;
cd bin
java -Xmx512m client 10 0 highmem members 32
read[/code]
and save that as run.sh

What that would do is create a file that users on Linux can use (the same as people on windows use .bat files). 
The concept is the same as a .bat so converting it should be easy. You don&#39;t need the Java directory like you do on Windows so none of that C:/Program Files/Java/bin/Jre7/ or whatever that crap is.

For Linux users to actually use that .sh file is not a matter of just double clicking and running (unless they have stuff setup for it).
To execute the .sh file you do the following:
1) Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
2) Navigate to the directory of the client/run.sh, this can be done by using the cd command (e.g. [i]cd Desktop/MyCoolClient[/i]  )
3) Once your directory is set, type [i]sh run.sh[/i] (run.sh would be the same of the .sh file). 

It&#39;s fairly easy stuff.

Just make sure that the file locations etc., match what&#39;s available on Linux.
A method you could do is:


[code=java]
String os = System.getProperty(&quot;os.name&quot;);
if (os.contains(&quot;nix&quot;) {
    //do linux/unix stuff
} else if (os.contains(&quot;windows&quot;) {
    //do windows stuff
} else if (os.contains(&quot;sunos&quot;) {
    //do solaris stuff
}
[/code]
That&#39;s just an example showing a method you could do.
Now it&#39;s up to you to make life easier for Linux users. 

Hope this helps.</description>
