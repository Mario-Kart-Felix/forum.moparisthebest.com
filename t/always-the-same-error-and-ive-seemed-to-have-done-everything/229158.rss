    <title>Always the same error, and I&#39;ve seemed to have done everything</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/always-the-same-error-and-ive-seemed-to-have-done-everything/229158</link>
    <description>Every time I try to log onto my server &quot;scapescape.no-ip.info&quot;, I always get the same error when trying to log onto it.

&quot;Error connecting to server. Must be down.
Click &quot;Cancel&quot; then &quot;Start Server&quot; to make your own&quot;

The thing is, I had no problem compiling, or starting the server, but it just seems no matter what I do, I cannot get onto my own server, which means nobody else can.

I&#39;ve done everything right, no problems with java, i&#39;ve port forwarded and got the no-ip program and have it running, and I&#39;ve made sure that the actuall text of the runserver is working.

Here&#39;s another weird thing, whenever I do actually click &quot;Start Server&quot; then log on to the server made by mopar, I log on perfectly no problems.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.


EDIT: Also, I don&#39;t know if this will effect anything, but I&#39;m using pj16 as a source, but I think I might switch to another one soon and see if that helps anything</description>

<p>I’m just wondering how the heck I can get on whenever I just use the “start server”, but not whenever I try to use scapescape.no-ip.info[br][br][size=1]Posted on: August 31, 2008, 09:27:19 pm[/size][hr]Sorry for the double post, but I’d also like to say that I’m using pj16 as a source, if that effects anything</p>
