    <title>But I guess he wants to spend more time locking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/but-i-guess-he-wants-to-spend-more-time-locking/158461</link>
    <description>Well, God Of Ikki didn&#39;t wanna help. So he locked every topic i made because I guess he has too much power than what he should have.

My question was, I have installed both 5.0 and 6.0, They didn&#39;t work.

I am talking about Java for everyone who is like God of Ikkii and needs every single little detail that can be possibly given.</description>

              <p>No, I’m not. It’s just I feel that before you lock a topic you should help the person. If it’s in the wrong section or not. Mine was at least close to the right section. ( I posted in questions).</p>
<p>I think moderators should help also.</p>

              <p>No, It’s not saying that. I wish it was because I know how to do that. Lol. It’s saying I don’t have 5.0 or 6.0 all together.</p>
<p>EDIT: I am sorry God Of Ilikki</p>
<p>The compiler wasn’t right.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

              <p>Spell his name right. And your giving no DETAILS either. So your java is installed, and i take it when you try to compile, it says cannot find the path specified? set your paths, or use this compiler for jdk 6 u 3</p>
