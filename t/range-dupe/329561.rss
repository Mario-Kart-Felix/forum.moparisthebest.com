    <description> Ok i have this dupe on my server:

1.both players dont wear anything
2.one takes range gear other takes items he wants to dupe
3.the guy with dupe items gets a skull
4.and then range guy starts killing other guy
5.when range guy sees that other guy is dying (emote) and the he clicks log out
6.the duper guy keeps clicking log out so that both of them log out at the same time
7. then they bot log in
8.they take 2x the duped items
