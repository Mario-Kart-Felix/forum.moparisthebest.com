    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-whole-new-items-into-moparscape/119710</link>
    <description>[size=13pt]Hello, Id like to know why they don&#39;t make brand new items into Moparscape. If u have the famous &#39;Skillcapes&#39; into a server it would get alot more visitors. And then i mean REAL Skillcapes and not a normal cape with just an emote. Take a example: If u have your own Habbo server then u have just the normal stuff into your Hotel. If u also host your own DCR (maked with Sulake unprotector) U can make whole new stuff they never seen in a Hotel before. I read people making now their own Client for their Moparscape server. Isn&#39;t it possible to make new stuff then? Also the makers of Moparscape knows how they maked all other stuff into it. Why they dont give us &#39;Real Skillcapes&#39; to ..
Post ur suggestions here please, Thanks ;)[/size]</description>

<p>This tells me and other members that you do not read the stickies. If you did you would know that he has a point because spelling and grammer is a rule. Before you post again, READ THE STICKIES.</p>
