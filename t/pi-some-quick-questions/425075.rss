    <description>Mk so ive looked around for tutorials and stuff, experimented on my own and all but these thing just wont work...

1. how do you make a dialouge action that teleports you aswell as sending another dialouge? ive tried and i cant seem to get it to work. whenever i teleport it wont run the next chat.

2.how to change the player spawn locations. (ive edited in the config.java file and it wont change.)

3.how to make the price of viewing in-store items equal to what they cost. for example if something is in the store and the price in the prices.txt file is 1 bil, if you buy the item it will cost you 1 bil, but if you price check it it would say 1.149 bil. i wanna know how to make the price check not multiply the actual price by 1.149. someone said they would make a tutorial on runeserver but then decided it was too easy  &gt;_&gt; i dont have any idea how to do it so help please

thanks</description>
