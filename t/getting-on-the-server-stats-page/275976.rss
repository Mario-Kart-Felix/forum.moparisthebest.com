    <title>Getting on the server stats page</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-on-the-server-stats-page/275976</link>
    <description>I know that the server statues page is at current considered a mess, and is been rewritten. However i have a question. I have ran my server for well over 56 hours now, yet it doesn&#39;t seem to get verified. The stats page does say &quot;Wait 24 hour.&quot; I thought to myself in the first 24 hours perhaps they have stopped verification and stuff while they rewrite it. Turns out thats not the case.
Name                             Since        Play
II MercyPvp II Back  94%  04-27-09  High / Low  
PureChaos 24 7 Webclient  88%  04-27-09  High / Low  

I will then ask how am i supposed to get verified. I&#39;m really sick of waiting. Was I naive to believe this would take 24 hours. 

Lastly I really really would just like an answer to how I get verified. I have ran servers before and never had this problem.</description>
