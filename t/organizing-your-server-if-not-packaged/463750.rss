    <description>Wut are we doing?

Hello moparians today I&#39;m showing you, something i did for my server a while a go, its not great but we&#39;re not all born knowing how to package and this is good to organize your server if you use delta or allstar.

Difficult: -300/10

First of all go where all your files are (folders, Class and java files) and make a new folder called source and put everything in it but compiler and runserver.

After that We open the notepad and add this
[code]
@echo off
del *.class
[/code]
Save it as Classdel.bat (make sure you save it where all your class files are at.)
Then run it. (what it does is that it deletes all your class files instead of deleteing it one by one)

The next step is making a new folder called bin.
You&#39;re going to put all your folders there (config folders, character folders.. blabla)
Note: We don&#39;t put any java or class files in our bin folder yet.
Also move the server.ini and your runeserver there.

Now go where our compiler is at and Replace it with this
[code]
@echo off
title Compile
cd source
&quot;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_05\bin\javac.exe&quot; -cp . -d ./Bin/ ./*java
pause
[/code]
Make sure you change it to your path
after that we compile and class files should appear in our bin folder.
The last step is opening the notepad again.
Add this:
[code]
echo off
cd source
cd bin
start runserver.bat
[/code]
Save it as run.bat and once compiled you&#39;re ready to run your server.

Notes: Make sure that the file that runs your server is called runserver.bat (with no uppercase letter), dont forget to put it in the bin folder and also dont forget putting the server.ini in the bin folder.

I will make a better one soon.
