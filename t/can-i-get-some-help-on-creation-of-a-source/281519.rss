              <p>They’re all just versions of Runescape. I don’t know the dates of them, but 317 is basically the oldest version of Runescape we have (apart from classic) and 517 is one of the newer versions (HD etc). Remember these are client versions, the server is just built around the client so it wouldn’t include all the updates Jagex had at the time - just the client related stuff.</p>

              <p>You have to understand that you can’t just go out to complete a task like that with barely any programming knowledge. There are no guides out there on how to <span class="bbcode-b">build</span> a server because if there was, it’d be 1) Very very long and 2) Basically leeching a source because they’re telling you what to do.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to actually “leech” peoples sources for a while but make massive changes to them. Then when you’ve learnt enough doing this, try to write your own server but I expect that’s at least 12 months away from your stage now and by then you’ll be looking back at your posts thinking “Man I was fucking retarded back then”.</p>
<p>Anyway I’ll stop rambling now. Have fun <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
