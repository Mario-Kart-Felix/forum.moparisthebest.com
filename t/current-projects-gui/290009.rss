    <title>Current Project&#39;s GUI</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/current-projects-gui/290009</link>
    <description>Well here&#39;s the GUI for my current project that I&#39;m working on, I thought about releasing the GUI but writing a tutorial that got all functions working without being source-specific would be near impossible =P.

^ Site contacts included urls = advertisement.
It amazes me that some people still don&#39;t know about using html in Java swing controls.

[img]http://i27.tinypic.com/34nffk7.png[/img]
^ exception color changing was probably going to be baleeted.

[img]http://i32.tinypic.com/xgip0y.png[/img]
^ Just quick reference Data that would load from your configuration files (.cfg)

[img]http://i25.tinypic.com/10fx7ac.png[/img]
^ select a player from the playerlist or type in a username and click the load button, gives many options to edit/fuck with the selected player ;)

Obviously the player information is blank and such as the server isn&#39;t running. The Data tabs would fill with information from your configuration files (autospawn.cfg, item.cfg, etc.) and the black box would replace the command prompt.

I got about half way through adding it to a random delta (I had originally planned on releasing delta based because so many people use it) but I realized that writing a tutorial would be difficult and making it work would be different from base to base.</description>
