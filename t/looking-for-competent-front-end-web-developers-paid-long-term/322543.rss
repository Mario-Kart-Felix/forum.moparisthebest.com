    <title>Looking for competent front-end web developers (Paid, Long-Term)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-competent-front-end-web-developers-paid-long-term/322543</link>
    <description>Hey there Moparians.

I am looking for a couple of front-end web developers (read: XHTML, CSS, JS) who want long-term paid work. You will, on most projects, be part of a group providing bespoke solutions to small businesses and individuals. I am particularly interested in looking for people who can handle the whole shebang of front-end development, that is to say, graphics/general layout&amp;design work as well as the XHTML, however feel free to apply with any subset of these skills. 

You will be paid as an independent contractor (or the legal equivalent in your country) which in most cases means you&#39;ll be considered self employed and have to look after your own taxes and such. This is a per-project, not a salary-based relationship and you will have the freedom to take or leave individual projects as you are offered them. You agree that your work on our projects becomes full property of the client, and that you will also adhere to any per-project NDA-type restrictions.

Applicants must:
- Have the ability to write up XHTML and CSS web pages/front-ends, given a specification. 
- Optionally have the ability to create full layouts using XHTML, CSS, Javascript, any graphics package.
- Be of age to sign a contract in their country, or have a parent/guardian willing to read &amp; sign on their behalf.
- Be allowed to work as an independent contractor in their country.
- Be a great team player. Communicating via Skype/IM is a must - although we expect people to be able to work independantly to spec. when required, we also want human beings who will be part of the team.

To apply:
Send an email to sam@boxn.co.uk with (at least) the following information:
- Your name
- Your age
- Your country of residence
- Your skillset - are you an XHTML ninja? Do you do full layouts? Just a graphics guy?
- Examples of your previous work. References and live sites would be great, but screenshots and code examples are fine.

Hope to hear from some of you soon, I know there&#39;s some great designers on here who should be being recognized for their stuff. :)

EDIT: Forgot to mention, if you have any questions at all feel free to email sam@boxn.co.uk, I don&#39;t bite hard. :)</description>

sorry but no photoshop plugin is ever going to output semantic xhtml and css with optimized images.<br>

admittedly it doesnt do it perfect, im sure over time i can learn to refine my coding skills so that i can do it without the crutch that is the plugin[/quote]<br>
You’re better off in the long run if you learn to build your design into xhtml and css.</p>

Not to turn the topic into discussion but how does the plugin work, turns different things into links and that kind of stuff?</p>
