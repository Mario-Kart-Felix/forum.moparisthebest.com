    <description>Well, here&#39;s my version of Rock Paper Scissors.
 
Readme.txt
[code]
Well, if you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;ve obviously downloaded my
Rock Paper Scissors program which I posted.
Good for you &lt;3

Feedback is ultra highly appreciated.

Anyway, enjoy &lt;3.

You may redistribute this, heck, what do I care.
But, credits would be nice,
but are not needed.
[/code]

Oh, this uses a command window.
I&#39;m working on a GUI based one.
Or better yet, struggling on a GUI based one.

Anyway...

Enjoy,
