    <title>How to add an emote/rank requirement to an item</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-to-add-an-emote-rank-requirement-to-an-item/338005</link>
    <description>Alright, i had posted this on another topic because someone needed help with it. So i thought i might as well just post it so everyone who doesn&#39;t already know this easy command.

Outcome:
[IMG]http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn231/xSynysterFenceX/floatingworks.gif[/img]

----------
[size=18pt][i][b]Emotes and Items[/b][/i][/size]
[b]Difficulty: 1/10
Files worked with: client.java (in your source folder.)[/b]
-
Ok say we just added wings to our server, and now we want them to animate. We want them, so that while we are currently wearing the item, we are able to walk around, while preforming an emote

Here is a emote list for everyone who doesnt have one: http://www.mediafire.com/?5zyi5zzjiwz

Now out of all those, we are going to select these emotes:

[code]
1500 - Floats up
1501 - Continuation of 1500[/code]
These commands, most commonly seen in the ::god command will now be used on an item to give it the same effect.
-
Now the first line of code we are going to do is the simplest part, here it is:

[code=java]if(wearID == WINGSID){[/code]

This is telling us that if you wear this item and the id is this, then such and such happens. But we still have to add that by doing this:

[code=java]
           if(wearID == WINGSID){ //sets it so if you wear this item the following happens
            setAnimation(####);    //This is the starting animation for the item       
            playerSE = ####;        //This is what emote will be preformed as they walk around
            playerSEW = ####;        //This is what emote will be preformed as they walk around
            playerSER = ####;        //This is what emote will be preformed as they walk around
            playerSEA = ####;        //This is what emote will be preformed as they walk around
}[/code]

I have explained what the code does via (//) comment tags.

Now we are going to need to add in the emotes:

[code=java]if(wearID == ####){
            setAnimation(1500);
            playerSE = 1501;
            playerSEW = 1501;
            playerSER = 1501;
            playerSEA = 1501;
}[/code]

and you know have an item that can enable the user to float around with it.

hope this helps.

[size=18pt][i][b]Ranks and Items[/b][/i][/size]
[b]Difficulty: 1/10
Files worked with: client.java (in your source folder.)[/b]
I wont take much or really any time on this tut because its so simple.
-

Ok now say we want to make an item donator only to use. You use the kind of ezpz way and add it into the item.java under donator, but sometimes that doesnt work and we want a secure rank on this item.

In your client.java and search [code=java]public boolean wear(int wearID, int slot) {[/code]

Under that paste this:
[code=java]
if(wearID == #### &amp;&amp; donator == 0){
 sM(&quot;You need to be a donator to wear this item.&quot;);
return false;
}[/code]

That is stating that if you try to put this item on and your not a donator, you will not be able to wear it and you will get the message &quot;You need to be a donator to wear this item.&quot;

Simple as pie.

===Other Rank Requirements==


[code=java]
//Moderator and up+

if(wearID == #### &amp;&amp; playerRights == 0) {
 sM(&quot;You need to be a mod or better to wear this item.&quot;);
return false;
}

//Adimin and up+

if(wearID == #### &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 1) {
 sM(&quot;You need to be a admin or owner to wear this item.&quot;);
return false;
}

//Owner only
if(wearID == #### &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 2) {
 sM(&quot;You need to be a owner to wear this item.&quot;);
return false;
}

[/code]

              <p>no because its basically saying if your player level is 0, you can not wield anyting moderator and above<br>
if your player rank is 1 or less then you can not wield this item unless your an admin or owner<br>
and the last one is saying that if your rank is 2 or less, you can not use the item.</p>
<p>Instead of giving the requirement dead on, your giving what ranks cant wear the item, which is like giving it a requirement but backwards.</p>
<p>By putting the rank of the player that cant use the item, it allows people with the higher or lower rank to be able to use it.</p>
<p>Giving the rank requirement effect, it actually works quite nicely.</p>

<p>and you know have an item that can enable the user to float around with it.</p>

<span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty: 1/10<br>
Files worked with: client.java (in your source folder.)</span><br>
I wont take much or really any time on this tut because its so simple.</h2>
<p>Ok now say we want to make an item donator only to use. You use the kind of ezpz way and add it into the item.java under donator, but sometimes that doesnt work and we want a secure rank on this item.</p>
<p>In your client.java and search <code>public boolean wear(int wearID, int slot) {</code></p>
<p>Under that paste this:</p>
<p><code>
if(wearID == #### &amp;&amp; donator == 0){
 sM("You need to be a donator to wear this item.");
return false;
}</code></p>
<p>That is stating that if you try to put this item on and your not a donator, you will not be able to wear it and you will get the message “You need to be a donator to wear this item.”</p>
<p>Simple as pie.</p>
<p>===Other Rank Requirements==</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">//Moderator and up+

if(wearID == #### &amp;&amp; playerRights == 0) {
 sM("You need to be a mod or better to wear this item.");
return false;
}

//Adimin and up+

if(wearID == #### &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 1) {
 sM("You need to be a admin or owner to wear this item.");
return false;
}

//Owner only
if(wearID == #### &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 2) {
 sM("You need to be a owner to wear this item.");
return false;
}
