              <p>Are you looking to open a GUI interface in the Runescape game? If that is the case, I would start looking where the bank menu is implemented and learn from that. You could write your own method, but it would be easier to modify a pre-existing generic menu. For example the one that pops up with text.</p>
<p>All that data is in the client and actually quit easy to understand, if you know <span class="bbcode-b">basic java</span> Then you could either use an object in the game or one of the buttons on the righthand menu to trigger your menu.</p>
