    <title>Wtf?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf/463666</link>
    <description>While coding my server (which is an Allstar) and editing some shops my computer freezes and crashes.
after about rebooting my computer about 10 times, my computer starts working again but when I run my server i noticed all of the npcs I moved were gone... Turns out my source&#39;s autospawn.cfg was &#39;reset&#39; I guess if you want to call it that and I was wondering if anyone else ever encountered something like this because I&#39;m not sure if any other files were changed as well.</description>

<p>Yeah, I understand where you’re coming from, but when those 2 files ‘reset’ themselves they went totally back to the original file…Lol do you know how annoying it is to organize each every item in about 8-10 shops…with 20-28 items in each shop <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> FML</p>

              <p>this has happened to me before…it happened when my laptop died unexpectedly. and it didnt have a chance to save it (my laptop doesnt hold a charge so if it gets unplugged it dies immediately.) even though i had saved the document my laptop hadnt saved it to itself…i guess idfk. all i know is everything from the past like 15-20 mins before it happened got deleted… <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"></p>

<p>If you were still working in it when it crashed, it probably didn’t save unless you saved previously. The NPCs are probably all at the locations where they were before you moved them.</p>

<p>They are, but I believe I only had the shop.cfg open…why would the autospawn change?</p>
<p>Also I just found out my shop and autospawn are completely ‘reset’ to the default content when I originally downloaded the source… that’s fucking beat.</p>
