    <description>Ok so i started the server. It is online i checked with a server checker. Everything is portforwarded. I run my server and then i connect with the client. My friend who is on the same network as me tries to connect and it says:
Connection Reset
Client Null Disconnected

He did put my server ip in the gui.java file.
How do i solve?</description>
