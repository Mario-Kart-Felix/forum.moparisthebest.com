    <title>Wtf?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf/127150</link>
    <description>When I trade my shops, I disconnect. Except one shop. It&#39;s Zeke in Al-Kharid. Before I turned him into a shop, trading him made you pickpocket him, get money and thieving xp. I changed it so he was a shop, and now my shops are messed up. I also added a teleport, which I took out, deleted the 2 shops I made, and my shops still didn&#39;t work. 


PLEASE help me.

I would like to know how Zeke was before, cuz that made my server run. Now that he&#39;s a shop, it&#39;s all messed up. I just deleted the old Zeke out of my autospawn and added a new one. So it&#39;s prob his ID, which I&#39;ll try and change.

Thanks if you help.</description>
