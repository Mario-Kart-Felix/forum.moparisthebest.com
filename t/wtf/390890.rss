    <description>So, saw this thread on MITB, but it was locked.

48÷2(9+3)=?????

Does that mean:

48÷[2(9+3)]=

or

(48÷2)(9+3)=

or something else?

.. because without parentheses or brackets, the whole thing seems ambiguous to me..</description>

Oh, so like basic calculus I guess? Idk. The first year I took calc, we did L’Hopital’s Rule, etc. Did you?</p>

Damn, I hate when that happens. This will als probably happen to me because I tend to ignore geometry a lot even though I actually like maths.</p>

When you have a bunch of operations of the same rank, you just operate from left to right. For instance, 15 ÷ 3 × 4 is not 15 ÷ 12, but is rather 5 × 4, because, going from left to right, you get to the division first.</p>

<p>Yes, I forgot the parentheses around the 18 + 6. It’s possible that the original equation is 48 / (18 + 6), and someone factored out 2, resulting in 2(9 + 3), or if they had factored out 6, it would be 6(3 + 1). We’ll probably never know. If the equation designated parentheses around the 2(9 + 3), then it would without a doubt be 2. It’s generally understood that when dealing with parenthesis, multiplication is (sort of) included, or implied multiplication.</p>

<p>You don’t factor when you can combine terms still, first off. That goes with the “solve parentheses” part of PEMDAS/whatever other acronyms there are. Then you read from left-to-right.</p>
<p>NONE of this, none of math at all, is subjective (that’s the goal of math). The answer is 288.</p>

<p>Still have to do parenthesis first which would lead you back to the first equation, right?</p>

<p>48 divided by the quantity of 2 times the sum of 9 and 3.</p>
<p>Here’s another problem:</p>
<p>6/3*2</p>
<p>is it 1 or 4?[/quote]<br>
…which is why I’m saying it’s ambiguous.</p>

That’s pretty much the same problem, just different numbers and without the bracketed numbers.<br>

<p>Exactly. You also have to think of the original equation like this:</p>
<p>48 / 18 + 6</p>
<p>which results in 2 (48 / 24)</p>
<p>The original equation could have just factored 2 from the right side of the / sign.[/quote]<br>
I don’t understand.</p>
