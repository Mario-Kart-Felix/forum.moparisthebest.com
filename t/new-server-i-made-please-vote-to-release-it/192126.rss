    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/new-server-i-made-please-vote-to-release-it/192126</link>
    <description>Well, I have created a server that is mostly a whole new one, that is totally different from anyone else&#39;s, but I&#39;m not quite finished. I got tired of coding on it, but all thats left is changing prices and shops and drops (I changed drops, but for some reason it didnt affect them ingame, I changed, comiled ran server, and still old drops.... so yea...

But should I release it as Beta for now and finish coding it later?

Things I have left to add:

(cba to take pics or I would have)

Chicken madness minigame
HBG Fighter minigame
Shops
Prices
Drops

Things I already have added:
New pk area
New teaming area
Jad in mage bank area (only one)
KQ in lair, but only 1
3rdage is now a jungle demon who hits up to 50... its at lederhosen random
Godwars is now a skeletal hellhound that hits 50 as well, its at lvl 11 wildy dragon pit, that i boxed in with rocks...
Veng works
Home is underground in the black knight area
Prayerguild is there in monestary
Warrior guild in smoke dungeon (80 strength needed to use teleport)
Range guild in rangers guild area (80 range needed to use tele)
Mage guild in mages guild area (80 mage needed to use tele)
Mod zone, idk remember where i put it lol
Admin zone, ata wierd runescape church, which is on runescape lol
&quot;perfect&quot; ring give +750 to all stats (admins best friend lol)
Bandos is best armor ingame
Re-did whips stats to bring it back to pking
Obby Mace gives +210 str making it the best weapon ingame
scyth give +500 in all stats
Glowing dagger gives +500 in all stats
and some other random items, like D bow hits twice always, specs work
I tried making pumpkings cost 300M ea, and heal 99, but they simply didnt want to heal, they currently heal 30 lol...

anyways, should I release it, yes/no please vote...</description>
