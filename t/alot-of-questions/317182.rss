hmm,<br>
i’m asking for links to threads with-n these forums which might help if you do not know the answer yourself,<br>
do not post pointless  crap like “google knows the way”<br>
if you don’t know the answer then don’t bother posting in the help section,<br>
you’ve only tooken upmy time.<br>

<p>The reason I didn’t blatantly spoonfeed you is because that isn’t how I do things. I try to get the users to go out and find the answer themselves as it helps them realize they can find the answers they’re looking for without relying on someone all the time. It also helps you (referring to all MoparScape users here) become independent in real-life situations.[/quote]Being independent, you’ll find, is the best way to go about private server development. I don’t see how you could be so ignorant as to pass up the The Sou’s suggestion. That search engine filters your questions to specific sites to help you with RSPS development. Everyone that succeeds at moparscape has either done everything on their own or limited their questions to only a few by solving them on their own via trial and error.</p>

<p>Not 100% sure what you mean, but to edit what the map/land looks like you’d have to change the mapdata - there are tools for this. You can add models as an NPC in class5, and as an object in class46 (all client-sided).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just add an animation and gfx to an emote button. If you want the real animations/gfx from runescape, you’d have to add them client-sided (has been done and released, check google).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just search around for a drop party command - I’m sure loads of servers have done it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">playerRights</span> is just another integer - you can make it anything you want through the character files, or make a command for it(I think). You can use something like 5 for anything you want; just add appropriate limits to the things you want them to have access to (commands, objects, etc.). Also, you’d probably have to add some client sided stuff for new crowns to match the new rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Item on item method - most servers (if not all) will have it. Try searching for <span class="bbcode-b">case 53</span> in your client.java.</p>
