    <description>[center][size=15pt]Tommy Chong Arrested[/size][/center]

If you don&#39;t like this topic. Don&#39;t post. If you&#39;re smart, you&#39;ll read this and become smarter. No &quot;too long, didn&#39;t read&quot; bullshit. 

For those of you who watch That 70s Show, did you notice that Leo ([url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001045/]Tommy Chong[/url]) suddenly left the show for a little while? Well guess what I just finally found out. The drug laws in the US are complete shit!

Tommy Chong at age 65 was arrested in 2003 for drug paraphernalia. [url=http://www.dea.gov/concern/paraphernaliafact.html]Drug paraphernalia[/url] is having utensils to do drugs such as a bong or thin paper to wrap joints in. You can smoke tobacco in a bong or in thin paper, but that would be illegal and you can get sent to jail. You can buy the thin paper legally from Store 24 and other stores and it&#39;s perfectly legal to sell it, but if you get caught with it (just holding it, in your back seat, in your house, whatever) you can be prosecuted. 

Just like I said before, the drug laws (and various other laws in the US) have gone to complete shit thanks to Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and the Bush administration (although credit doesn&#39;t go just to bush, the drug laws have been evolving since the 60s, 70s, 80s, and present day today).

I watched That 70s Show since the day it came out. I always wondered why Leo (Tommy Chong) suddenly dissappeared. He was in jail for 9 months in Taft, California. Tommy Chong&#39;s close friend, Josh Gilbert, taped Tommy in jail and created a documentary called [url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478090/]A/K/A Tommy Chong[/url] starring famous actors and comedians such as Jay Leno, Bill Maher, and Tommy Chong&#39;s children Paris Chong, Shelby Chong, and many more.

User Comments: 
&quot;The film gives an extremely eye-opening look at drug policy in this country. I don&#39;t think that most people realize the roots of the most of the drug laws in the U.S. are based in racism, and this film does a great job of exposing that in a non-preachy (even hilarious!) manner. Anyone who has the chance should absolutely catch &quot;a/k/a Tommy Chong.&quot; - [url=http://www.imdb.com/user/ur2552603/comments]pcarone[/url]

I looked through a bunch of torrent websites and I couldn&#39;t find the movie. I guess I&#39;ll just have to go to my local video place (like a noob) and bring it home and rip it onto my computer and make my own torrent. lol jk, but I will bring it home and watch it. Poor Tommy. 65 year old guy going to jail over something as dumb as drug paraphernalia. 

Tommy Chong is famous for movies such as Up In Smoke, Still Smoking, and many more.

Another person scorned by the Shrub&#39;s Administration includes Bobby Fisher, chess champion of the world, for saying bad things about Bush. I think Bobby Fisher called Bush a moron on television. Freedom of Speech my ass. We have no rights in the United States. United States is actually Nazi Germany.

Yesterday, someone in a library said &quot;Bush is so fucking clueless&quot;. A librarian heard him, phoned the cops, and 5 cops came into the library and took the man into interrogation. He got off, but to be put through all that shit, all that humiliation, especially when we have freedom of speech. Where is America that America poses to be? Where is the free country? Where are our rights? Where!?!

Hopefully our next president can get rid of The Patriot Act, not spy on our phone calls, not go to war with random countries, not try to prevent gay marriages, not try to prevent abortion, not try to prevent research on stem cells, not try to fake votes, have Bill Clinton as a vice president and not some sadist like Dick Cheney. I&#39;m sure I have missed about 20 more.

              <p>It is a little off topic, but it’s the general discussion board. That means anything “in general”. Reagan wasn’t that great of a president cause he was the one that started the US defecit when he invested billions and billions of dollars into the Star Wars program.</p>
<p>That was a program that was supposed to have satellites detect incomming missiles and destroy them immediately with a laser. Even though he invested huge amounts of money, he could never get it to work. Russia tried to keep up with the US, because at the time, US and Russia were at war. Everyone thought the world was going to end and it was a time of chaos. So as US put more money in, Russia did too. Eventually Russia went bankrupt because they spent too much money.</p>
<p>Maybe if Reagan wasn’t president, we might have had a huge war on our hands. So you never know. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>There is more than just those kinds of laws in the U.S. If I were you I would look into drug companies in the U.S. They are our largest market. The government makes more money off of people being sick than anything else. Also look into things like the cure for AIDs and HIV. It is nothing more than your house hold bleach. Around 70 billion has been speant on the research of the cure, but most don’t know they have had the cure the whole time and for 70 million they couldn’t find a way to put enough bleach in your body without harming other things inside your body. You have to realize the government has everything set up for a reason. In the governments eye’s the truth of things is too much for our simple minds to handle however alot of people like myself dissagree with this. If I didn’t then I wouldn’t of actually read all of that which I did. It’s sad what happend to Tommy Chong, but there are worse things going on the U.S. to direct all my focus and energy to one person.</p>

<p>If you don’t like this topic. Don’t post. If you’re smart, you’ll read this and become smarter. No “too long, didn’t read” bullshit.</p>
<p>For those of you who watch That 70s Show, did you notice that Leo (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001045/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Tommy Chong</a>) suddenly left the show for a little while? Well guess what I just finally found out. The drug laws in the US are complete shit!</p>
<p>Tommy Chong at age 65 was arrested in 2003 for drug paraphernalia. <a href="http://www.dea.gov/concern/paraphernaliafact.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Drug paraphernalia</a> is having utensils to do drugs such as a bong or thin paper to wrap joints in. You can smoke tobacco in a bong or in thin paper, but that would be illegal and you can get sent to jail. You can buy the thin paper legally from Store 24 and other stores and it’s perfectly legal to sell it, but if you get caught with it (just holding it, in your back seat, in your house, whatever) you can be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Just like I said before, the drug laws (and various other laws in the US) have gone to complete shit thanks to Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) and the Bush administration (although credit doesn’t go just to bush, the drug laws have been evolving since the 60s, 70s, 80s, and present day today).<br>
<a href="http://www.nypress.com/19/24/film/jennifermerin.cfm" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">NY Times News Source</a></p>
<p>I watched That 70s Show since the day it came out. I always wondered why Leo (Tommy Chong) suddenly dissappeared. He was in jail for 9 months in Taft, California. Tommy Chong’s close friend, Josh Gilbert, taped Tommy in jail and created a documentary called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478090/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">A/K/A Tommy Chong</a> starring famous actors and comedians such as Jay Leno, Bill Maher, and Tommy Chong’s children Paris Chong, Shelby Chong, and many more.</p>
<p>User Comments:<br>
"The film gives an extremely eye-opening look at drug policy in this country. I don’t think that most people realize the roots of the most of the drug laws in the U.S. are based in racism, and this film does a great job of exposing that in a non-preachy (even hilarious!) manner. Anyone who has the chance should absolutely catch “a/k/a Tommy Chong.” - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/user/ur2552603/comments" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">pcarone</a></p>
<p>I looked through a bunch of torrent websites and I couldn’t find the movie. I guess I’ll just have to go to my local video place (like a noob) and bring it home and rip it onto my computer and make my own torrent. lol jk, but I will bring it home and watch it. Poor Tommy. 65 year old guy going to jail over something as dumb as drug paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Tommy Chong is famous for movies such as Up In Smoke, Still Smoking, and many more.</p>
<p>Another person scorned by the Shrub’s Administration includes Bobby Fisher, chess champion of the world, for saying bad things about Bush. I think Bobby Fisher called Bush a moron on television. Freedom of Speech my ass. We have no rights in the United States. United States is actually Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Yesterday, someone in a library said “Bush is so fucking clueless”. A librarian heard him, phoned the cops, and 5 cops came into the library and took the man into interrogation. He got off, but to be put through all that shit, all that humiliation, especially when we have freedom of speech. Where is America that America poses to be? Where is the free country? Where are our rights? Where!?!</p>
<p>Hopefully our next president can get rid of The Patriot Act, not spy on our phone calls, not go to war with random countries, not try to prevent gay marriages, not try to prevent abortion, not try to prevent research on stem cells, not try to fake votes, have Bill Clinton as a vice president and not some sadist like Dick Cheney. I’m sure I have missed about 20 more.</p>
