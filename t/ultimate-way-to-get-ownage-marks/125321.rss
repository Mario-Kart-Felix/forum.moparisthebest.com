    <description>There is only 1 true way. Listening in class, asking your teacher questions and studying.

Ofcourse you dont always have your teacher on handy other option is using google.
Im willing to help people in here. I like maths post any math questions here, and others i suppose. Maths &lt;3</description>

              <p>[quote=“BobDole81, post:5, topic:125321”]In my view, unless you have some kind of documented learning disability, all you need is some kind of motivation to learn.  When in a classroom, good teachers are essential to stimulating a desire to learn in the students.  But if you wish to succeed yourself and you want to learn, you can. [/quote] My parents dont go for that. I has dyslexia , so on test and such i usealy do quite horible , but i know the material. They say that my dyslexia is no excuse for getting a c or d etc. The way to impress our teachers it to atleast seem like you care. If you have a good attitude about things and dont slack off, they’ll usealy not be so harsh when they grade you.</p>

<p>But that’s not guaranteed to work all the time…I’ve had teachers back in early high school who used to stomp their foot whenever something was likely to come up on the test.  And I’ve also had teachers who hate giving A’s…one of my US History teachers gave most of the class 89%'s on our essays, just so he could give the impression of the course being difficult.  I managed to get an A at the end because the final was mostly multiple choice, but there are crazy teachers out there.</p>
<p>Generally, you’re right though.  If you put the time into it, there’s really no reason you shouldn’t do well.[/quote]</p>
<p>Lol I had a teacher in 6th grade which was so stupid she couldn’t speak english.<br>
Some schools are desperate for teachers…</p>
