    <description>First off I&#39;m not a leecher. I&#39;m just confused. 

 Okay i want to use some auto stuff for runescape but I have no idea how they work and what scar is. So if anyone wants to help me it would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.



Can someone please help? I have the script in the scar box but what do I do now?
