    <description>Ok hello this server is going to be a eco/skill/pk server, I want this to be a very amazing server with very active users, any coder that would love to code this server will be given co-owner, I have made servers in the past but the coder I had was an ass and taunted me and treated me like a child and I wish that not to happen again, I would like this server To contain anything a normal server can, I want it to be the best and trust a coder who codes this will be known by alot of people and I&#39;ll make sure is really popular with the players (smooth moves xD) I will make a bad ass site and advertise so hopefully people would love to be in the team that makes on of the most greatest servers in history.
