    <description>Well... been going to goodwill on Saturdays because its 50% off (lol, discount at goodwill) surprisingly they have some good stuff.... todays story.. I needed a vacuum (as I am tired of buying new ones as I tend to get one every 1-2 years).

I found two that I liked, one was $6 and the other didn&#39;t have a power cord...The one without the power cord was a lot better than the $6 one. I approached the counter asking the lady if she had a power cord for the vacuum. She said that since there is no power cord as they could not find one I am wasting my time with it and its trash. I than called up the 1-800 number on the box to see how much the power cord would cost. 

The lady on the phone gets the vacuums details from me... model number etc.. and she told me that my vacuum has been recalled and I just need to ship in my vacuum and they will send me an upgraded newer version for free. I told her I don&#39;t have my receipt for the item and if that was okay. They were totally fine with it...

A free vacuum + shipping = new upgraded vacuum.... shipping it out tonight. 

Not to mention I found $20 on the ground today...
