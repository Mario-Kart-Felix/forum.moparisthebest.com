    <title>Good Source</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/good-source/244066</link>
    <description>I need a better source. The one I have been using for about a year is slow and buggy. It isn&#39;t the server its being hosted on as a previous RS server we had on it didn&#39;t lag at all.

What im looking for:

1. Not Very Laggy
2. Not super buggy/glitchy
3. Probably be easier if it isn&#39;t 508, as I have yet to figure out how most of it works
4. Some custom places and npcs already put places, not as in custom items etc, as I have a good client for my old 317 with customs etc and I am willing to add in the old NPC spots and shops.


Help is very much appreciated and whoever who helps me out will get their names on the credits and the creator of the source will also get their name on the credits.</description>
