    <title>Has anyone had any luck with U-Verse Portforwarding?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/has-anyone-had-any-luck-with-u-verse-portforwarding/332166</link>
    <description>I need to know if anyone has been able to port-forward on AT&amp;T U-Verse; I have tried multiple times to do this, but every time my port is still closed. 

If you have been successful, please make a guide or tell me how you did so.

Thanks.

EDIT: I GOT IT OPEN! YAY!
As it turns out, my comodo firewall was on with my windows firewall. Oddly enough, when i turn both firewalls off it blocks doesn&#39;t allow connections, but when windows firewall is on and comodo is off, it works.</description>
