    <title>HELP WITH 508 !-now-!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-508-now/297881</link>
    <description>Hey, well for starters, these are what I have done.

1.) Downloaded cache508 + titana cache.
2.) Placed them correctly, and I&#39;ve double-checked them, they are right.
3.) Downloaded my 508 HD IP Changer Client.
4.) Ran an HD Server, which is Rune~Realms v2.
5.) Double-Clicked RUN and it said the Server is started on port:43594
6.) Double-Clicked the RUN in client folder, then I set the IP to 127.0.0.1 and i also tried 0.0.0.0
7.) Updates........ and it doesn&#39;t even get to 80%, it never even starts and I get this horrible message AGAIN!
8.) error_game_js5io
9.) I also checked the Client Files, and by default, it&#39;s at 127.0.0.1 like normal.

What do I do??

This was a copy paste from Run3serv3rWPS i read it and its the same problem i have, somone answer this!!!! &gt;.&lt;</description>

              <p>Make sure your client AND server are BOTH 508</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Make sure that your client is connecting to the same port the server is opening. (Default 43594)</p>
<p>If those are both correct… Your server should be running fine… I can’t help you with anymore then that. Also, I don’t recommend IP changer clients. The few I’ve used were unstable.</p>

<p>My suggestion: (Based on my experience)</p>
<ol>
<li>Download a new client (a different one)</li>
<li>Run your server</li>
<li>Use the IP address 127.0.0.1</li>
</ol>
<p>If it still doesn’t work… Post here again and let me know what happens.</p>
<p>Also:<br>
What OS are you using?<br>
What source are you using?<br>
What type of server are you running? 508, 317, or 525?</p>
