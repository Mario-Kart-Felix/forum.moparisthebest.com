    <title>Insane-f2pk COMING BACK SOON V3</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/insane-f2pk-coming-back-soon-v3/303514</link>
    <description>I have been working on a version 3 for quite some time now, I have decided to take the server down last month until I am done with updates. I had a poor host which gave me alot of down time, when the server was not down the community seemed to have alot of fun. I&#39;d like to thank Adam and Chase for their fine previous work and teaching of coding in v1 and v2. I have not had help yet in the v3 trying to get all the coding knowledge I can. When I first released the server, it was my first private server ever, I should not have released yet but I needed it tested to find out the flaws. I have been going through the insane-f2pk forums and have taken alot of suggestions into consideration implying them into the game. Server now has a webclient ready and will be hosted on a dedi when i release v3. Do not forget about me my fellow players :) I will not let you down, major updating has commenced! You can find my on msn or sometimes I log in king-pk IGN insane pk3r. 

Ps. chase I have not forgot about you times are rough, I will get to you asap. THANKS!</description>
