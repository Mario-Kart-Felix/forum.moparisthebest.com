    <description>DISCLAIMER: PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!! THE AUTHOR DOES&#39;T TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU DESTROY YOUR XBOX. READ ALL THE DOCUMENTATION CAREFULLY BEFORE TRYING TO ATTEMPT ANY MODIFICATION TO YOUR XBOX. 

What is Softmodding?

Softmodding is a form of modification you can do to your Xbox, without having to open it. It has become more popular over the last year or so because of the simplicity of it, plus being able to be installed within minutes instead of what can take hours with a modchip.

 Once your Xbox is Softmodded, you can proceed to install programs (or store movies, music etc.) on the remaining space on your Xbox E Partition. This partition was designed by Microsoft to be used as a game save location, but since they have allocated around 5 gigabytes to this area, you can easily store your own stuff on there. Just make sure you leave around 400mb free for game saves, most people shouldnâ€™t need more than that.

 It will also allow you to play burned DVDs (using DVD Region X) and burned Games. Depending on your Xboxâ€™s DVD Drive you may also be able to use CD-R or CD-RW media for smaller games, or for transferring over data.
What are the advantages / disadvantages of Softmodding?
Advantages

       

    * A softmod can be performed a lot easier and quicker than a modchip installation.
    * A softmod does not physically void your warranty, however the softmod and hacked game save must be removed (and the Microsoft Dashboard restored to its original state) for your Xbox to be completely void free.
    * You can boot burned media (games and movies) just like a modchip.
    * You can store information on your Hard Drive like more applications or media (pictures, music, and videos).
    * You can use FTP to communicate with your Xbox via your PC.

       

Disadvantages

       

    * A softmod can not be turned on or off like a modchip, the only way to turn off a softmod is to remove it.
    * Installation of a larger hard drive using Softmodding can be very complicated and time consuming.

       

About Softmod Installer Deluxe v2.0

Softmod Installer Deluxe was created by me (DJB) after experiencing problems Softmodding a friendâ€™s Xbox. I was using the lTools Softmod package for Splinter Cell, only to realize that the only lTools Softmod package which worked on an Xbox 1.6 was the MechAssault package, which I did not have the proper version of.

 After about a week of work, I released a very buggy v1.0, which only worked for 007 and installed the Evolution-X dashboard. However 2 days later I released v1.01 which was completely fixed, and in a few weeks released v2.0 which was completely compatible with Action Replay and Mega X-Key saves. It has been tested on many Xboxes, including the new Xbox 1.6b version, and has been proven to work.
How to get the Softmod files from PC to Xbox Memory Device

There are 5 files within Softmod Installer Deluxe 2.0, which are:

SID.007.AUF.v2.0.Xbox-Hq
SID.MechAssault.v2.0.Xbox-Hq
SID.Splinter.Cell.v2.0.Xbox-Hq
SID.Splinter.Cell.v2.0.NTSC.Xbox-Hq
SID.Splinter.Cell.v2.0.PAL.Xbox-Hq

Please note that there is an extra NTSC and PAL gamesave for Splinter Cell, so make sure you use the correct one for your region.

You can download Softmod installer Deluxe either from Xbins or Bit Torrent.

Now, the 3 most popular ways of transferring the game save are described below:
Transferring via a modded Xbox

1. Launch your Xbox dashboard which has FTP support (Evolution-X etc.)

2. Access your Xboxâ€™s FTP via the PC using a FTP Client (like FlashFXP).

3. Navigate to your Xbox Memory Device (usually is Partition Letters H to O).

4. Navigate to the game save you want to copy over.

5. Transfer the game save to your Memory Device. Please remember that you have to copy over the actual whole folder that has all the letters and numbers in it, NOT just the contents of the folder.
Transferring via Action Replay

 

1. Open the Action Replay software on your PC.

2. Drag and Drop the zip file into the PC Database.

3. From there you should be able to drag and drop from the PC Database to your Xbox Memory Card.

Transferring via Mega X-Key

 

 

1. Copy them to the â€œSavesâ€ folder created by the Mega X-Key software. The default location is C:\Program Files\Mega X-Key\saves.

2. Open the Mega X-Key software.

3. Drag and Drop the game saves to your Mega X-Key.

 
How to use Softmod Installer Deluxe 2.0

Now that you have got the game save onto your memory device, you have to put it on your unmodded Xbox. This is very easily done:

1. Insert the Memory Card and turn on the Xbox.

2. Select Memory on the main MS Dash menu.

3. Select your Memory Card.

4. Select the Game save.

5. Select Copy, and then select your Xbox HDD. After a couple of seconds the game save will be on the Hard Drive. Remember that with Splinter cell there are 2 games, the Linux Installer and the Splinter Cell saves.

 

Now, reset your Xbox and insert the original game, which is either 007 Agent under Fire, MechAssault, or Splinter Cell. Please note that Xbox Classics versions will not work, so you need to get an old copy of this (second hand would be your best bet).

 

Once you have loaded the game, you have to load the game save. All three games have different ways of doing this, which is explained below:

 

    * 007 Agent under Fire: When you&#39;re at the main menu of the game, select &quot;Load Mission&quot; and then highlight &quot;Xbox HDD&quot;. Press A to boot the Installer.

    * MechAssault: When you&#39;re at the main menu of the game, select &quot;Campaign&quot; and then highlight &quot;Run Linux&quot;. The information below should be shown when highlighting this, if so press A to boot the Installer. If not, your version of MechAssault is too new (the exploit was patched in later releases).
       Controls: Normal
       Difficulty: Regular
       Current Level: Going Down Hard

    * Splinter Cell: When you&#39;re at the main menu of the game, select &quot;Load Game&quot; and then highlight &quot;Linux&quot;. Press A to boot the Installer.

 

OK, now weâ€™re ready to start Softmodding your Xbox.

 

6. Use the &quot;Create C Backup&quot; option to backup your C drive. To back up the Eeprom you&#39;ll need to use the Evolution X dashboard. The Eeprom backup is stored at C:\Backup (this can&#39;t be changed unfortunately) so please remember this.

7. Install the Softmod. Please note this deletes the MS Dash from C Drive, hence why you have been told to use the backup feature.

8. Install what dashboard you wish to use. Unfortunately due to lack of space I can only put Evolution X and UnleashX in this package, I hope that is good enough. You have the choice to install the dashboard to either C or E Drive.

9. Shut down your Xbox, then restart it, remove the disc, and close the tray. If this has worked like it should, you should see your choice of dashboard (either EvoX or UnleashX). Please note if you boot your Xbox and leave the DVD Tray open it will take you back to the menu where you installed your Softmod.

10. If you want to put the MS Dashboard back on your Xbox, you&#39;ll need to put MS Dash 5960 on your Xbox. This comes standard with Xboxes 1.6 and higher, so older Xboxes will need to upgrade. The easiest way to do this (once the box is softmodded) is to use my Auto-Installer Deluxe to delete the files from C Drive and install the latest MS Dash. Note: when this is done you&#39;ll have to repeat steps 6 to 9.

11. Restart your Xbox with the DVD tray open to bring up the Softmod menu. Run the &quot;Patch MS 5960&quot; now, and it will put the MS Dash back on C Drive, and patch it so your hacked dashboard can now use it. Note, the MS Dashboard will be called msdash.xbe now, since the Xbox still needs the hacked xboxdash.xbe in order to boot the softmod. Once you&#39;ve selected this option, it will run through some tasks, and then boot PPF-XBOX to do the rest. After PPF-XBOX has done its work it will restart your Xbox.

12. Now is the time to make a backup of your modded C drive. This comes handy just in case a game tries to update your dashboard. If this ever happens, just use the &quot;Restore Mod Backup&quot;. If you ever want to remove the Softmod (mainly for Xbox Live purposes) you can restore your backup of C Drive by using the &quot;Restore C Backup&quot; option in the Softmod menu.
Using Softmod Installer Deluxe alongside Auto-Installer Deluxe

Once your Xbox is softmodded, you can proceed to use Auto-Installer Deluxe to customize your Xbox a little more to your own needs. Just a couple of things to remember before you do:

    * If you Xbox has a stock standard Hard Drive, you can only use Partition E to store programs on.
    * You might not be able to format your hard drive, so you would have to actually delete all the files from a certain partition if you wanted to clear it.

 One of the best features of Softmod Installer Deluxe is that the BIOS included with the installer will search for C:\evoxdash.xbe and E:\evoxdash.xbe, unlike most of the other softmod packages which put their dashboard at C:\Dashboard\default.xbe or E:\Dashboard\default.xbe. The reason I done this was because this is the way that a mochipped Xbox would be set up, and in that sense being more compatible to upgrade to another dashboard, either with Auto-Installer Deluxe or most other Auto-Installer packages available (Slayers, X-Disk etc.)
Conclusion

So there you have it, a nice simple way to mod your Xbox without even having to touch one screw. Personally I would still use a modchip as they are more reliable, easier to upgrade the HDD, and some of the newer chips will actually let you play Xbox Live as well without any problems or being detected.

The way I like to describe Softmodding is that itâ€™s a taste of the modded world of Xbox; however they do seem reliable enough to be able to operate pretty much flawlessly, except the exclusion of Xbox Live. Still, there are many other alternate ways to play Xbox online, so Xbox Live is coming more of an option rather than a necessity.

I hope you all enjoyed reading this article / tutorial, hopefully a few of you might actually want to try this out. Just remember, if you do, read through this thoroughly and make sure you understand it before doing anything. This has the capability of screwing your Xbox if you donâ€™t do this correctly.

 

Thanks for reading

              <p>DISCLAIMER: PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!! THE AUTHOR DOES’T TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY IF YOU DESTROY YOUR XBOX. READ ALL THE DOCUMENTATION CAREFULLY BEFORE TRYING TO ATTEMPT ANY MODIFICATION TO YOUR XBOX.</p>
<p>What is Softmodding?</p>
<p>Softmodding is a form of modification you can do to your Xbox, without having to open it. It has become more popular over the last year or so because of the simplicity of it, plus being able to be installed within minutes instead of what can take hours with a modchip.</p>
<p>Once your Xbox is Softmodded, you can proceed to install programs (or store movies, music etc.) on the remaining space on your Xbox E Partition. This partition was designed by Microsoft to be used as a game save location, but since they have allocated around 5 gigabytes to this area, you can easily store your own stuff on there. Just make sure you leave around 400mb free for game saves, most people shouldnâ€™t need more than that.</p>
<p>It will also allow you to play burned DVDs (using DVD Region X) and burned Games. Depending on your Xboxâ€™s DVD Drive you may also be able to use CD-R or CD-RW media for smaller games, or for transferring over data.<br>
What are the advantages / disadvantages of Softmodding?<br>
Advantages</p>
<pre><code>* A softmod can be performed a lot easier and quicker than a modchip installation.
* A softmod does not physically void your warranty, however the softmod and hacked game save must be removed (and the Microsoft Dashboard restored to its original state) for your Xbox to be completely void free.
* You can boot burned media (games and movies) just like a modchip.
* You can store information on your Hard Drive like more applications or media (pictures, music, and videos).
* You can use FTP to communicate with your Xbox via your PC.
</code></pre>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<pre><code>* A softmod can not be turned on or off like a modchip, the only way to turn off a softmod is to remove it.
* Installation of a larger hard drive using Softmodding can be very complicated and time consuming.
</code></pre>
<p>About Softmod Installer Deluxe v2.0</p>
<p>Softmod Installer Deluxe was created by me (DJB) after experiencing problems Softmodding a friendâ€™s Xbox. I was using the lTools Softmod package for Splinter Cell, only to realize that the only lTools Softmod package which worked on an Xbox 1.6 was the MechAssault package, which I did not have the proper version of.</p>
<p>After about a week of work, I released a very buggy v1.0, which only worked for 007 and installed the Evolution-X dashboard. However 2 days later I released v1.01 which was completely fixed, and in a few weeks released v2.0 which was completely compatible with Action Replay and Mega X-Key saves. It has been tested on many Xboxes, including the new Xbox 1.6b version, and has been proven to work.<br>
How to get the Softmod files from PC to Xbox Memory Device</p>
<p>There are 5 files within Softmod Installer Deluxe 2.0, which are:</p>
<p>SID.007.AUF.v2.0.Xbox-Hq<br>
SID.MechAssault.v2.0.Xbox-Hq<br>
SID.Splinter.Cell.v2.0.Xbox-Hq<br>
SID.Splinter.Cell.v2.0.NTSC.Xbox-Hq<br>
SID.Splinter.Cell.v2.0.PAL.Xbox-Hq</p>
<p>Please note that there is an extra NTSC and PAL gamesave for Splinter Cell, so make sure you use the correct one for your region.</p>
<p>You can download Softmod installer Deluxe either from Xbins or Bit Torrent.</p>
<p>Now, the 3 most popular ways of transferring the game save are described below:<br>
Transferring via a modded Xbox</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Launch your Xbox dashboard which has FTP support (Evolution-X etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access your Xboxâ€™s FTP via the PC using a FTP Client (like FlashFXP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to your Xbox Memory Device (usually is Partition Letters H to O).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate to the game save you want to copy over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transfer the game save to your Memory Device. Please remember that you have to copy over the actual whole folder that has all the letters and numbers in it, NOT just the contents of the folder.<br>
Transferring via Action Replay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Action Replay software on your PC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag and Drop the zip file into the PC Database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From there you should be able to drag and drop from the PC Database to your Xbox Memory Card.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Transferring via Mega X-Key</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy them to the â€œSavesâ€ folder created by the Mega X-Key software. The default location is C:\Program Files\Mega X-Key\saves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Mega X-Key software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drag and Drop the game saves to your Mega X-Key.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How to use Softmod Installer Deluxe 2.0</p>
<p>Now that you have got the game save onto your memory device, you have to put it on your unmodded Xbox. This is very easily done:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Insert the Memory Card and turn on the Xbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Memory on the main MS Dash menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select your Memory Card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the Game save.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select Copy, and then select your Xbox HDD. After a couple of seconds the game save will be on the Hard Drive. Remember that with Splinter cell there are 2 games, the Linux Installer and the Splinter Cell saves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, reset your Xbox and insert the original game, which is either 007 Agent under Fire, MechAssault, or Splinter Cell. Please note that Xbox Classics versions will not work, so you need to get an old copy of this (second hand would be your best bet).</p>
<p>Once you have loaded the game, you have to load the game save. All three games have different ways of doing this, which is explained below:</p>
<pre><code>* 007 Agent under Fire: When you're at the main menu of the game, select "Load Mission" and then highlight "Xbox HDD". Press A to boot the Installer.

* MechAssault: When you're at the main menu of the game, select "Campaign" and then highlight "Run Linux". The information below should be shown when highlighting this, if so press A to boot the Installer. If not, your version of MechAssault is too new (the exploit was patched in later releases).
   Controls: Normal
   Difficulty: Regular
   Current Level: Going Down Hard

* Splinter Cell: When you're at the main menu of the game, select "Load Game" and then highlight "Linux". Press A to boot the Installer.
</code></pre>
<p>OK, now weâ€™re ready to start Softmodding your Xbox.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>Use the “Create C Backup” option to backup your C drive. To back up the Eeprom you’ll need to use the Evolution X dashboard. The Eeprom backup is stored at C:\Backup (this can’t be changed unfortunately) so please remember this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install the Softmod. Please note this deletes the MS Dash from C Drive, hence why you have been told to use the backup feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install what dashboard you wish to use. Unfortunately due to lack of space I can only put Evolution X and UnleashX in this package, I hope that is good enough. You have the choice to install the dashboard to either C or E Drive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shut down your Xbox, then restart it, remove the disc, and close the tray. If this has worked like it should, you should see your choice of dashboard (either EvoX or UnleashX). Please note if you boot your Xbox and leave the DVD Tray open it will take you back to the menu where you installed your Softmod.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to put the MS Dashboard back on your Xbox, you’ll need to put MS Dash 5960 on your Xbox. This comes standard with Xboxes 1.6 and higher, so older Xboxes will need to upgrade. The easiest way to do this (once the box is softmodded) is to use my Auto-Installer Deluxe to delete the files from C Drive and install the latest MS Dash. Note: when this is done you’ll have to repeat steps 6 to 9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restart your Xbox with the DVD tray open to bring up the Softmod menu. Run the “Patch MS 5960” now, and it will put the MS Dash back on C Drive, and patch it so your hacked dashboard can now use it. Note, the MS Dashboard will be called msdash.xbe now, since the Xbox still needs the hacked xboxdash.xbe in order to boot the softmod. Once you’ve selected this option, it will run through some tasks, and then boot PPF-XBOX to do the rest. After PPF-XBOX has done its work it will restart your Xbox.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now is the time to make a backup of your modded C drive. This comes handy just in case a game tries to update your dashboard. If this ever happens, just use the “Restore Mod Backup”. If you ever want to remove the Softmod (mainly for Xbox Live purposes) you can restore your backup of C Drive by using the “Restore C Backup” option in the Softmod menu.<br>
Using Softmod Installer Deluxe alongside Auto-Installer Deluxe</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once your Xbox is softmodded, you can proceed to use Auto-Installer Deluxe to customize your Xbox a little more to your own needs. Just a couple of things to remember before you do:</p>
<pre><code>* If you Xbox has a stock standard Hard Drive, you can only use Partition E to store programs on.
* You might not be able to format your hard drive, so you would have to actually delete all the files from a certain partition if you wanted to clear it.
</code></pre>
<p>One of the best features of Softmod Installer Deluxe is that the BIOS included with the installer will search for C:\evoxdash.xbe and E:\evoxdash.xbe, unlike most of the other softmod packages which put their dashboard at C:\Dashboard\default.xbe or E:\Dashboard\default.xbe. The reason I done this was because this is the way that a mochipped Xbox would be set up, and in that sense being more compatible to upgrade to another dashboard, either with Auto-Installer Deluxe or most other Auto-Installer packages available (Slayers, X-Disk etc.)<br>
Conclusion</p>
<p>So there you have it, a nice simple way to mod your Xbox without even having to touch one screw. Personally I would still use a modchip as they are more reliable, easier to upgrade the HDD, and some of the newer chips will actually let you play Xbox Live as well without any problems or being detected.</p>
<p>The way I like to describe Softmodding is that itâ€™s a taste of the modded world of Xbox; however they do seem reliable enough to be able to operate pretty much flawlessly, except the exclusion of Xbox Live. Still, there are many other alternate ways to play Xbox online, so Xbox Live is coming more of an option rather than a necessity.</p>
<p>I hope you all enjoyed reading this article / tutorial, hopefully a few of you might actually want to try this out. Just remember, if you do, read through this thoroughly and make sure you understand it before doing anything. This has the capability of screwing your Xbox if you donâ€™t do this correctly.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<p>Incredible, apparently you can actually SoftMod your Xbox.<br>
