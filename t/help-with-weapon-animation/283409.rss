    <title>Help with weapon animation... ^^</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-weapon-animation/283409</link>
    <description>Hey, I am using a source called PwnScape, and when i hold a godsword it is held vertically, not horizontally like a 2H... I&#39;ve been told that it is in client.java and under &#39;getWepAnim&#39;. I&#39;ve tried that, and the ID for any godsword was not there, so i added one, and copied that exact same thing from a D2H, just changed the wepon ID. But nothing different happened, i still hold it vertically, please help &gt;.&lt;</description>
