    <title>ISO source, www files, client</title>

    <description>I downloaded an old pp2p source but was in complete, it&#39;s missing tons of files

Looking for a complete rscd v25 with client, www files (preferably sw0o0sh&#39;s ones with the fixes done to it for exploits/injections)

I&#39;ve searched all over for a link for these but have only found old dead/broken/expired links or a upgrade to premium link

Would appreciate this very much! Thanks again</description>
