    <title>Is anyone successfully botting OSRS accounts?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-anyone-successfully-botting-osrs-accounts/555696</link>
    <description>Hi guys,


Are any of you working on a bot, or private scripts for one of the public bots, that has successfully leveled an account in OSRS?
I was taking a look at a few of the free bots yesterday wondering if it was worthwhile writing scripts for them.


A bit of discussion indicates that some people are having success with private scripts, while those using public scripts are pretty much shit out of luck and likely banned within two or three days.


So yeah, does anyone have any thoughts on this?</description>

<p>do they take a cut for selling scripts and do people actually buy them? Why does the walking related stuff look like a resurrection of iBot? ruler_eric is at it again?</p>

Does their pathfinding handle obstacles though? Things like opening doors en route?</p>

              <p>I mean it can range between 200-1000? You can obviously break them into different classes, since they have a git repository you use and automatically compile your scripts from. It’s quite nice! I’d have to pull and check if you want an exact number. Most of my scripts are ‘dynamic’ and just are a skeleton that fit under certain conditions that scan the area, check if it meets the condition to run, gives options to the user, and off it goes. Obviously there’s various data views to help that scan and as Jagex adds in new content I just add in new configurations. Simple stuff, and never breaks. Which helps me since I can do fudge all and collect my paychecks.</p>
<p>The scripts where you code in ‘case by case’ are massive. THousands of lines. It’s awful.</p>
<p>I actually advised to them to stop using their stupid web based pathfinding and use HPA* since it’s terribly inefficient (although it WORKS for most situations, eh) so that I could do some very advanced scripting. Most actions in Runescape aren’t actually that complex, and in scripting the pathing is one of the most annoying pieces because you can’t rely on the way they do it and code it in yourself. At least I don’t trust their methods since they black box it and are adamant about not sharing how they do it which is bloody stupid. I honestly am just super annoyed with them most of the time lmao. Too secretive, it’s not even a trade secret just tell me how exactly the pathing works so I can determine if its bollocks or not.</p>
<p>Which on the subject of HPA*, it’s an interesting algorithm. I tried implementing it a few times but it’s fairly complex.</p>

              <p>Yeah. The APIs are about the same, and I think the payouts are too. I think OSBot has a larger userbase but on one of my free scripts I had close to 10k users so. But only the gold farmers want to dish out money for scripts, like in the hundreds. It’s not worth the time, the easy cherry picking scripts get more of a profit. It’s because there’s a lot of scripters and it’s fairly easy to do so they can find it ‘cheaper’. Which is bollocks I’m not doing 5-10 hours of work for 100$. Lmao.</p>

<p>You just have to get the + or ++ rank to sell scripts (You could easily get ++ and it’s nice for recognition so people trust you more).</p>
<p>The API is ‘meh’ because in my opinion most people who write bots don’t understand that you should be able to do multiple tasks with various devices asynchronously to one another. Like you have two hands, you should have at least two threads executing actions for the mouse and keyboard simultaneously with futures that you can chain to block. The developers just scoffed that point off like ‘Well it works why would we change it’.</p>
<p>But eh. I don’t have the time to write a bot and I wouldn’t make nearly as much as I would just writing simple scripts.</p>
