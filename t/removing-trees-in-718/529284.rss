    <title>Removing Trees in 718</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/removing-trees-in-718/529284</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve tried to remove a tree, which has partially worked. 

The bottom of the tree has been removed, however the leaves still remain at the top. I have tried removing the space along the y axis 1 above and below the tree but this hasn&#39;t done anything. 

How are you supposed to remove trees? This is what I&#39;m currently doing (this removes the bottom half of the tree): [code]World.deleteObject(new WorldTile(3097, 3502, 0));[/code]


Any ideas how I can remove the top half?


Any help would be much appreciated.</description>

              <p>Thanks for the reply - I tried that and still didn’t work, I had to delete a plane that was next to the base of the tree and up one.</p>
