    <title>Crashing Problem</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/crashing-problem/552629</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve just started working on this source editing it and so on, it seems to crash whenever I click an object such as a portal and things along them lines. 
I also noticed that this code pops up where the server is running if anyone could give me some help it would be good

Okay but a try-catch block still needs to be added around the main game thread or this crashing will happen all the time from simple exceptions. Exceptions are a normal occurrence in a production environment, do you really want your server crashing from something trivial like not typing command arguments correctly?</p>
<p>Also I should probably say that it isn’t a “crash,” the reason why your server exits is because you aren’t handling any exceptions which causes it to be thrown up the stack until it eventually reaches a place where it’s caught. In your case though, there is no place where it’s being caught so it terminates the main game thread, and the server exits because that’s the only non-daemon thread in your server.</p>
<p>You don’t have to listen to me if you don’t want though, you’ll see yourself when you put your server live.[/quote]</p>
<p>Alright, I’ll have a look around about that</p>

              <p>Add a try-catch block around the main game logic loop… no server should be crashing because of a simple StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. I also recommend reading up on <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">exceptions</a>.</p>
