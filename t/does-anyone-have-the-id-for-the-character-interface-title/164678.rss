    <title>Does anyone have the ID for the Character Interface title?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/does-anyone-have-the-id-for-the-character-interface-title/164678</link>
    <description>Hi. I was wondering if anyone has the Interface ID (Or whatever its called - I&#39;ve forgotten), for the character design interface&#39;s title?
I was hoping to change it so it doesn&#39;t say &quot;Welcome to RuneScape - Use the buttons below to design your character...&quot;, because its not RuneScape...
I have ran several searches using a for loop which uses sendframe126 on a large amount of IDs, but it doesnt want to find it. :(

Well, if anyone knows, could they please post here. Thanks.
