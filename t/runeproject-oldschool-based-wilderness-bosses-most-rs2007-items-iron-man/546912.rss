              <p><span class="bbcode-b">New Voting Store System:<br>
</span><br>
Spent a good deal on this, I had a vision at the beginning and then had a vision midway so this ended up changing and being added onto to make it what it is now.</p>
<p>The rewards:</p>
<p>1.5XP for 1 hour</p>
<p>1.5XP for 2 hours</p>
<p>Elite Slayer Task</p>
<p>10 RuneProject Points</p>
<p>10 Slayer Points</p>
<p>Elite Cluescroll</p>
<p>2.0XP for 1 hour</p>
<p>Mask Set(Not Halloweens)[ Tribal Masks, Highwayman Mask, Camel Mask, Zombie Mask, Gas Mask ]</p>
<p>20 Super Combat Potions</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Elite Slayer Tasks:</span></p>
<p>All of RuneProjects best bosses as a Slayer Task! You cannot get an Elite Slayer Task without finishing your current task. So it cannot be used for skipping and replacing.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">New Pets:</span></p>
<p>Fareed</p>
<p>Dharok</p>
<p>Torag</p>
<p>Karils</p>
<p>Veracs</p>
<p>Guthans</p>
<p>Ahrims</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Reworked Fareed:</span></p>
<p>New Area</p>
<p>Decreased Strength and Defence</p>
<p>Drops more frequently</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Decreased Combat Experience:</span></p>
<p>After speaking with players it was decided that it would be best to lower the combat experience rate to keep players training longer, this lengthens the grind and makes it much more enjoyable getting the 99’s.</p>
<p>[b]</p>
<p>Timed XP Bonuses:[/b]</p>
<p>Through the voting store, you can now purchase different xp bonuses for different lengths of time.</p>
<p>While your bonus xp is active you will have a line of text on your screen giving you a countdown on your experience bonus time.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Back To Edgeville?!:</span></p>
<p>That’s right, after over three months in Varrock changed in early RuneProject days to fulfil a neutrel environment, due to player demand we have moved back to Edgeville, on top of that I have added the Special attack altar, renamed the object itself and 90% of NPCs around Edgeville for easy notability. The RuneProject Project store NPC is now RuneScapes Paladin.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">HIGHSCORES?!:</span></p>
<p>The much awaited RuneProject Highscores are now available here, this is a huge credit Dynamic and a big project for us. The whole system was built from the ground up design and script wise, we do plan on adding extra features such as comparison before that comes up as a suggestion or ‘critisism’.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Super Combat Potions:</span></p>
<p>A super combat potion is a Super strength, defence and attack all in one, used by pkers to save inventory space as each dose is a dose of each of those potions. These can be purchased through the voting store or made with Herblore, the requirements are as follows: 90 Herblore, clean Torstol, Super defence, Super attack, Super strength potions. To make this, use a Clean Torstol on any super potion with the rest of the requirements fulfilled.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">New Login Interface:<br>
</span><br>
Designed by Dynamic to read briefs on the updates that were last pushed in the version. Sufficient for users who do not use the forums or are new; will let them know we are actively improving RuneProject.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Also:</span> A huge welcome to Luka who has joined our Webdevelopment team, his first project is to work in conjuction with myself on a new voting system, which will be tested over this week until flawless. To swerve the voting problems quite a few users have been having while voting, more insights and updates will be released on this shortly.</p>

              <blockquote>Most of you experienced downtime today due to a mistake made by myself in mid-development. 
So a couple of changes are in effect.
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Fixed Rare Drop Issue</span><br>
This is with the Ring of Wealth and the rare drop count/achievement.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Re-Added ROW Message</span><br>
Due to the claims of it not working, the message after  drops is now re-added.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Added Cancelling Slayer Tasks via Slayer Points</span><br>
10 Points a hard task, 10 points to remove a task; fair enough?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Vengeance Timer </span><br>
As many of you have seen I have been pking quite a lot on my legitimate account this week. I have noticed the annoyance of not knowing exactly when I can cast Vengance again, and when clicking it, it always prints 30 second wait between Vengance casts, so I have fixed this and now on each click it will tell you the exact seconds until you can re-cast.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Edgeville Teleport</span><br>
The lunar spellbook now has an Edgeville teleport</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Slayer Information</span><br>
Someone suggested that we add a command for kills left, some of you will know I despise commands and it shows a lack of innovation. So here is my alternative:<br>
Comes up when first Attacking and removes when you teleport away.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/893d20a7a618ed78213a44ac16b8cc68.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Starter Interface</span><br>
To swerve the “I didn’t know there was an iron man mode, can you iron me?” I have now added an interface for newcomers when they login, before proceeding their adventure they must choose between the Normal or Iron gameplay, it also explains the difference between the two.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Login Interface</span><br>
A nice looking login Interface for Halloween.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Login System</span><br>
Sadly another server with great and unique features has closed, I have since been purchasing their client features, the first of which is the logging in System, it’s still to be perfected to fit perfectly with our client but due to the issues you see 70% of it.</p>
<p>More to come on Saturday! Stay tuned!</p>

              <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nZXgXys.png" alt width="" height=""><br>
You guys wanted Elite Cluescrolls, here’s the final picture.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Elite Cluescrolls:</span></p>
<p>Obtainability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Outputted from the Barrows chest on a 1 in 50 chance(This is not definite.)</li>
<li>OSRS Wilderness Boss Drops(Caves, Kraken, Wilderness bosses, Lava Dragons)</li>
</ol>
<p>Possesion:</p>
<p>Like RS, you can only hold one Elite Cluescroll across your whole character file.</p>
<p>Tasks:</p>
<p>Myself, Kyonon and Aidyy came up with 31 unique and different tasks to complete during the Elite process.<br>
Please note: You will not have to do 31 different tasks to gain a reward, for every 5 tasks coded, the next was a reward. When handling tasks it randomizes between tasks, it could land on a reward the first time you start, or it could land on a reward after 17 tasks, you’ll never know; it’s purely luck dependant.</p>
<p>Types of Tasks:</p>
<p>When clicking on your cluescroll it will print your hint in the chatbox(No rhyme intended there).<br>
With the following format -<br>
“Clue Type: Hint”</p>
<p>There are three different types,<br>
Objects.<br>
Find NPC.<br>
Dig.</p>
<p>Finding NPC - A hint will be printed related to an npc spawned around the RuneProject map, you will have to find and speak to the NPC it involves.</p>
<p>Dig - With the hinted location, you will have to find the exact dig spot(All clue hints are hinted to an exact spot) and use a spade.</p>
<p>Objects - You have to search objects in the hinted area to find the item needed.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><br>
Other stuff:</span></p>
<p>Fixed/Reworked Teleport Tablets</p>
<p>Added Karambwans(Food)</p>
<p>Added Clickability to the ship in Camelot - Board the ship, go to the back of the ship and speak to the Captain to use his travel services to Port Sarim or Karamja at a price.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Iron Man:</span><br>
Do not receive the cash rewards for 99’s, but do receive the items from skilling rewards.<br>
Fixed accessibility to the slayer point store.</p>
<p>Removed the annoying “Received a 99 reward” reward message below the initial reached Skill level of 99 announcement for pure convenience</p>
