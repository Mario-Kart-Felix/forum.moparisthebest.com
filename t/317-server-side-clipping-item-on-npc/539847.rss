    <title>[317]Server-side clipping &amp; Item on NPC</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-server-side-clipping-item-on-npc/539847</link>
    <description>Hello,
I am wondering if anyone has serverside clipping figured out...

I do not mean NPCs, I mean player characters.
Forcing the players character to perform movements (although great for when using it for agility courses and stuff), the clientside clipping is completely ignored and the server just sends the character on its way through objects, walls, maps, computer screens and even neighbors houses... I was wondering if anyone would be willing to guide me or point me in the right direction on this...


And secondly, item-on-npc... Does anyone have this? I kinda found that using items on NPCs would repeatedly send the same packet type which on serverside is almost completely blank... and quite incomplete, it seems (as the server just flips out upon the next movement issued by the player).

Source: Delta


Thanks in advance :)</description>

<p>I don’t think there is an item on npc packet, if there is then it’s not documented on rswiki. You could just manipulate it through dialogs, ie the npc asks you for an item then you press ok to hand it to them or something.</p>

              <p>They’ve both been released. Item on npc you should be able to figure out on your own, if not PM me. And for server sided clipping last I saw was asshole_rule’s version of it, it’s for ‘PI’ which is just wL which is what delta is, all you have to do is change a bunch of names and such, really not hard at all.</p>
