How can a new player play RSC?  You have to wait 5 years.<br>
Seems like Jagex doesn’t want anyone to play classic at all, regardless that they are charging each monthly.</p>

              <p>2,000 players isn’t unrealistic and IMO it’s the number that is need to revive RSC. Look at the private server community and that’s a few hundred. This recent reopening, There were several hundred players playing at times. The 2009 reopening brought in around 9,000 and that lasted until they announced that it’s just temp.</p>
<p>This reopening won’t show any numbers because people won’t bother to commit to something temporary and bloated with an economy that bots have ran for 12 years?</p>
<p>I really don’t want to hear about oh people play apps now, “it’s all mobile” etc. There was a post on Reddit that hit the front page today that basically shit on all apps and bloated about how addicting games, armour games, or any flash website offered better games without ads than todays apps.</p>
<p>The problem private servers have:</p>
<p>We do not own the game.<br>
The client has never been fully refactored. This limits development due to shitty implementations.<br>
An average gamer thinks all download links are viruses/ keyloggers. Just witnessed this on twitch with someone checking out a private server.<br>
Runescape is a come and go game. Players and the time they play fluctuate heavily. Jagex has expressed this with analytics on their part.</p>
<p>Jagex if they cared to reopen it with support &amp; updates, 1 employee @ 30k? 30k/12 = $2500 a month.  = 250 players…<br>
If they game did get some support and updates. There would be more than 250 players. There are 300-700 on right now and they all know it’s shutting back down in 60 days.</p>
<p>Edit: 450 players online right now and it’s the worse time of the day for activity.</p>

Realistically though you might be looking at 100 to 200 players. It’s simply not a sound commercial decision to operate RSC and spend 30,000 GBP per developer per year maintaining it.</p>
