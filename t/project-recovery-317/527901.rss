    <description>[center]Here at Project Recovery, we&#39;re looking to go back to how things used to be. Not necessarily how RuneScape used to be, but how Private Servers used to be. Custom items, fun &amp; laid-back staff, unique features, and hours and hours of fun and easy gameplay. We&#39;re a small community looking to grow into something larger. Of course, we&#39;re VPS hosted and have 100% uptime. There are also frequent content updates because we are always looking to grow into something more![/center]

[ul][li]Points in Project Recovery aren&#39;t just PK points. They can be earned by doing a multitude of tasks, including Pest Control, Slayer, minigames, and more![/li][/ul]

[ul][li]This is one of our custom bosses, Party Pete. As you can imagine, he drops partyhats. He attacks with mage and melee.[/li][/ul]

[ul][li]This is the other custom boss of ours, named after one of our moderators. He uses all 3 attack types and drops penance gear, which is some of the best equipment in the game.[/li][/ul]

[ul][li]Pet cats! They&#39;re bug free, and you will never lose them.[/li][/ul]



[ul][li]We have loads of areas to train, including dragons, wyverns, and donator only training areas![/li]
[li]There are plenty more bosses than are listed here, including the God Wars bosses, KBD, the Giant Mole, and more![/li]
[li]Training is simple and fun, you can simply click the skill you want to train in your skills tab to train it[/li]
[li]We have a fully working highscores! (Shoutout to deathschaos9)[/li][/ul]
