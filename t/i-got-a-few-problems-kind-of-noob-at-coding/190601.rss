    <title>I got a few problems...kind of &quot;noob&quot; at coding</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-got-a-few-problems-kind-of-noob-at-coding/190601</link>
    <description>Alright, first of all and most importantly, I want to make it so when i log in, it says &quot;Owner xm1k3x has logged in&quot; and for my Co-owners:&quot;Co-owner (name) has logged in&quot;and same thing for mods..

Second..I&#39;m wondering how to make a ::switch command to switch mages...and I want to make it so only admins and co-owners can use it(and me).

Third...For some reason, my ipban command won&#39;t work...and sometimes even ::giveadmin and ::giveowner don&#39;t work.

Fourth, if someone could please post how to make a ::givemem command for me and please make sure you tell me where to put it.. -.-</description>
