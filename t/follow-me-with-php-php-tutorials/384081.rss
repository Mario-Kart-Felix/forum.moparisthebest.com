    <description>[b]Introduction:[/b]
I&#39;m not sure if this is the right section for PHP tutorials, just a guess, spam say I&#39;m noob do what you like, I aim to help people:

I&#39;ve decided to teach PHP and blog it as I go along learning it my self.
You can spam, call me a noob say what ever, it really does&#39;nt bother me.
But if you actually want to learn PHP. Come here.
I would also like to say that PHP seems to be very similar to Java, so if you have a fairly good knowledge
of Java, you&#39;ll be ok.


[b]PART 1[/b]
Downloading XAMPP:
1. Go to google.co.uk &gt; search xammp &gt; Apache friends, should be first link, or simply visit this link:
http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

2. It will have a list of mac, linux, windows etc etc... Choose what you run on, and download.

3. It will give you options, service the following:
MySQL
Apache
Filezilla.

4. Now you should have a little XAMMP icon on your desktop, or it may have open&#39;d already.
In this small box you should see &#39;modules&#39; then &#39;SVC&#39; under it tick all three boxes, but not mercurary.

5. Okay so your probably going to type some little bits of php into your text editor and its not going to work, that because you need to start all 3 of the services (Only one for the php, but its best to do all).
You will see admin and then on its right, start. Click all 3 starts and a little green box saying running will appear.

[b]PART 2:[/b]
How to local host a PHP file:

Before we start, this is solely for WINDOWS XP. Unless you have knowledge of where directorys are on any other.

1. Okay, so go to start &gt; My Computer &gt; Local Disk (C:/) &gt; [color=greenXAMPP[/color] &gt; htdocs
And thats where you MUST save your work as .php, so go ahead and save a php file named mhmm...
testpage.php

2. Put this into it and save testpage.php:
[code]&lt;?php
echo &quot;Hello World&quot;
?&gt;[/code]

3. Now go to your borswer, and put this into it:
http://localhost/testpage.php

Now you must remember that you MUST always save your work there. Otherwise you will not be able to open it.




[b]PART 3:[/b]
Some of the basics:

I&#39;ll be teaching you how to write php now.

To write in php, you need to ALWAYS start with a php tag 
Here is an example of a php tag:

[code]&lt;?php

blahblahlbah

?&gt;[/code]

PHP tags are what explain your code in some sense, but you must also remember that PHP tag comes before HTML. Otherwise it won&#39;t work or something, I&#39;m not sure.

[b]PART 4:[/b]
Text,numbers,variables:

Output is used variously through PHP, but there is also the concept of statements, whitch we&#39;ll be getting into later.
You may use a syntax word echo that gives output text onto the green?
Here is a small example:
[code]
&lt;?php
	echo &quot;See what I mean?&quot;;
?&gt;
[/code]
Echo canbe used for text or numbers, text will always need &quot;-&quot; but numbers, and I don&#39;t know why don&#39;t need &quot;-&quot;.
Here is an example of an echo text and echo number.
[code]
echo &quot;This is what text should look like!&quot;;

echo 673673
[/code]


[b]PART 4:[/b]
Variables, text:

Variable, complex maybe to you at the moment, but its not actually as hard as you may assume it is.
A variable is one that holds the place of another.
Example:
[code]
Door is another name for 567
[/code]
In this example instead of typing 567, you would type door, because that is the variable name? Its a little like math in school.
Algebra. When say... 67 + x, x = 80 answer is: 147. the variable is x, because it holds the place of 80.

Now here is an example in php.
In green, I will highlight the variable.

[code]
&lt;?php

$example1 = &quot;I&#39;m a noob example&quot;;

?&gt;
[/code]

Now we&#39;ve created a variable, but you might have tested it, and what do you know. It did&#39;nt work.
Remember the echo I shown you.
You must use that, but instead oh typing echo - some text. You can type the variable name.
Here an example, I&#39;ll highlight in green what I mean.

[code]
&lt;?php
$example1 = &quot;Display me&quot;

echo $example1

?&gt;
[/code]

Go test that, get good at it. And move onto part 5.


[b]PART 5[/b]
Variables, joining:

Now I&#39;m betting your confused when I said, variables, numbers? Well yes. This is literal algebra now ;) yay.
Now say you created a variable and it contained a number?
[code]
$examplenumber = 6666;
$exampleone = 6635;
[/code]
If you want to put these two variables together, like... Unite them as one when it comes to output. Say you output variable examplenumber and you got 6666, you could have:
6666 6635
The way you join them together is when they&#39;re echo&#39;d you use a dot (.)
[code]
echo $example1.examplenumber;
[/code]

[b]PART 6:[/b]
Variables, math, numbers:


Lets get started,
and please remember this is only basics. Your not pro yet ;).

Now here is a simple sum of adding two numbers together.
I&#39;d say this is learnable just from looking at it:
Example:
[code]
$imavariable = 100+10;

echo $imavariable;
[/code]

Or

[code]
$imavariable = 100-10;

echo $imavariable;
[/code]

Now if you notice, numbers don&#39;t use &quot;-&quot;, I don&#39;t know why, I don&#39;t know if they should. But thats how it is in PHP.

Now that is not the only way for you too add two variables together.

Heres an example:
[code]
$variableone = 100500;
$variabletwo = 555;

echo $variableone+$variabletwo;
[/code]

That small peice of code, will add the two variables together.
It will go to variable one, oh variable one is 100500.
Variable two, oh variable two is 555, lets add them together.

Okay so now I&#39;m betting your wondering, 

What multiply, whats divide?
I&#39;ll doc these down for you :)

Plus:
[code]+[/code]

Subtract:
[code]-[/code]

Multiply:
[code]*[/code]

Set it equal too:
[code]==[/code]

+

[code]&amp;&amp;[/code]



[b]PART 7:[/b]
If, else, elseif:

What this statement is, well its the exact same as Java basically.
It says If this, is this, if not do this...

Lets start create 3 variables:
Example:
[code]
$numberone = 100;
$numbertwo = 200;
$numberthree = 300;
[/code]


Now to explain the if statement.
Heres an example:
[code]
if ($numberone&gt;$numbertwo)
	{echo &quot;correct&quot;;}
else
	{echo &quot;this is incorrect&quot;;}
[/code]
 Pleae notice that your using [code] { } [/code]

Okay so at the top, its says... If number one, is bigger than number two
[code]
($numberone&gt;$numbertwo)
[/code]
Then we want it to echo (say) correct.
else (otherwise)
echo (say) it is incorrect.

The answer is incorrect because 100 is less than 200.
But if you changes the variable number one too 200.
And the variable 200 to 100, it would print correct.

Now for elseif statement.

Okay so create a variable.
Example:
[code]
$name = &quot;Kaex&quot;;
[/code]

Okay so now we&#39;re going to implement an if statement
Notice the ==.
[code]
if ($name == &quot;Kaex&quot;)
	echo &quot;Welcome shit brains&quot;;
elseif ($name == &quot;Noob&quot;)
	echo &quot;You should&#39;nt be here noob&quot;;
[/code]
You may keep on using elseif 100 times, or 1 billion times. Its allowed.

But you must end an elseif statement.
How?
You end it using the else. Otherwise it most likely will give you an error of somekind or just
will not work at all. Never done it wrong so I&#39;m not sure on that.
[code]
if ($name == &quot;Kaex&quot;)
	echo &quot;Welcome shit brains&quot;;
elseif ($name == &quot;Noob&quot;)
	echo &quot;You should&#39;nt be here noob&quot;;
elseif ($name == &quot;ThreeDaysGrace&quot;)
	echo &quot;Hii sexy&quot;;
else
	echo &quot;Who the f*ck is here?&quot;;
[/code]
As you can see, the last statement is the else, that finishes the if,elseif statement.
Where as a simple 2 option if statement does not require this.

[b]PART 8:[/b]
Switch statements:

Switch statements are commonly used in Java, but also PHP.
I&#39;d say they&#39;re better than if statements...
They use cases to test if the variable is true...
Here is an example:
[code]

&lt;?php

$smoking = &quot;you smoke&quot;;

switch ($smoking)
{
	case &quot;you smoke&quot;:
		echo &quot;Your a smoker&quot;;
		break;

	case &quot;nonesmoker&quot;:
		echo &quot;You don&#39;t smoke&quot;;
		break;
	default:
		echo &quot;fail&quot;;
		break;
}

?&gt;
[/code]

Okay so what this say is, smoking. You smoke currently.
case yousmoke, if you smoke it will print your a smoker.
If I was to change smokin to nonesmoker, it will print on the output
you don&#39;t smoke.

The default is like the else at the end of an ifstatement, it says if none of the above 
is tested true. Then print &quot;fail&quot;. You MUST always end a switch statement with
default.

[b]PART 9:[/b]
While loops:

While loop, basically says it in its name. This will loop over and over if
something is true. But once it becomes false, it stops the loop.

While loop is the most basic loop, I think.

Here is an example of a while loop, I&#39;ll explain the code below it:

[code]

&lt;?php

$number = 1;

	while ($number&lt;=5)
		{
		echo $number. &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
			$number++;
		}
?&gt;
[/code]

The variable &#39;number&#39; is equal too 1.
This loop is saying;
	While the variable number is less than, or equal too 5.
	We want you too echo the variable &#39;number&#39;.
	Then after that, we want you to grab that variable number.
	And increate it by one, each time.
	&lt;br/&gt; means add a break, its part of html.
So what it will do is go...
1
2
3
4
5
And then because of the &lt;=5 it stops.

Hope this helped guys.

[b]PART 10:[/b]
&#39;Do&#39; loops:

This is another loop, this allows you to do an action ATLEAST one time, whether its true.
Or false.

[code]
&lt;?php

$number = 10;

do
	{
	$number++;
	echo $number. &quot;&lt;br/&gt;;
	}
while ($number&gt;10);

?&gt;
[/code]
While the number is bigger than 10 or equal too, we want you to keep on printing number,
after number, and number.

But if we changed it to this...

[code]
&lt;?php

$number = 1;

do
	{
	$number++;
	echo $number. &quot;&lt;br/&gt;;
	}
while ($number&lt;10);

?&gt;
[/code]

It says, while number 1 is less than 10, we want you to print to 10.
But in the middle you see, $number++;
That means skip a number basically. Skip the first.

And thats all for do loops.  Get good at this, and move on to part 11.

[b]PART 11:[/b]
For loops:
This is a &#39;for&#39; loop, the is the last loop of the 3.

This allows the execution of a certain condition as many times as you like.
Here is an example of the &#39;for&#39; loop:

[code]
&lt;?php
for ($number=1; $number&lt;=5; $number++)
	{
	echo &quot;Hellow sexy Kaex&quot;.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
	}
?&gt;
[/code]
This will print Hello sexy Kaex 5 times, why?
The variable number is equal to 1. Then it says, if number is less than or equal
to 5. Print. But we incremented number++, and that basically adds one.
Here is an equation of how it would work:
[code]1, 5-1 = 4, number++ = 1. 4+1 = 5.[/code]
Printing it 5 times.


Now if you still don&#39;t understand this, cause it is tricky.
I&#39;m going to change the numbers.

[code]
&lt;?php
for ($number=2; $number&lt;=5; $number++)
	{
	echo &quot;Hellow sexy Kaex&quot;.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;;
	}
?&gt;
[/code]
Now here we see the number is 2?
But as long as it is less than or equal to 5. It will print.
So 5-2 is obviously 3. But on the end there is number++.
So you add 1 onto the 3. Leaving us with 4. Simple?
If you still need help just post a comment and I&#39;ll explain it in greater detail.


[b]PART 12:[/b]
ARRAYS!!!:

Many of you who do Java will be familiar with the concept and purpose of an &#39;array&#39;.
In PHP they did the syntax a little stupidly, for the noobs learning. Just follow me as I go along.

An array allows multiple shit stored in one value.
I shown you guys variables.
Example:
[code] $name = &quot;boobie&quot;;[/code]

But an array can store multiple values?
Here is an example of an array, they&#39;re easy. Trust me:
Example:
[code]
$noobs=array (&#39;SWAT&#39; ,&#39;Kaex&#39;,&#39;Somedude&#39;);
[/code]
Now in arrays the computer always starts at 0, no idea why but thats how it is so...
SWAT = 0
KAEX = 1
SOMEDUDE = 2

But say you wanted execute a variable in an array.
[code]
$noobs=array (&#39;SWAT&#39; ,&#39;Kaex&#39;,&#39;Somedude&#39;);

$noobs[1]
[/code]
That would be equal to Kaex?
If that was echo&#39;d, it would print Kaex.

The second way to write them is like this.
[code]
$noobs[0]=&quot;SWAT&quot;;
[/code]

Now to use part of the array in an echo, just an example of an execution.
[code]
echo $noobs[1];
[/code]

Please read this over carefully. Make sure you understand this.
They&#39;re EXTREMELY usefull.

[b]PART 13:[/b]
Associative Arrays: (I&#39;m not sure if thats its name)

So what these do basically is...
	I&#39;ll show an example first:
[code]
$food=array(&#39;bread&#39;=&gt;&#39;toast&#39;,&#39;nipples&#39;=&gt;&#39;boobies&#39;);

echo $food[&#39;bread&#39;];
[/code]
Now that says bread is equal to, toast?(bread/toast are called elements)
So when I echo&#39;d bread. It would output toast.
Basically same as arrays, just you don&#39;t use
[0]
[1]
[2]
[3]
Its simple. I think thats pretty self explanatory from there. If you need any help. Post a comment!

[b]PART 14:[/b]
Modification of arrays:

Welcome to part 14 of your PHP learning.

[code]
$noobs[0]=&quot;SWAT&quot;;
$noobs[1]=&quot;Kaex&quot;;
$noobs[2]=&quot;Somdude&quot;;

echo $noobs[0];
[/code]
Simple array.
But say you have a LONGASS string of arrays.
And you did&#39;nt know the number for the last one.
You could use...
[code]
$noobs []=&quot;Mendorphins&quot;;
[/code]
Leaving empty brackets will just add it onto the end.

But then lets say we want to create a new element to replace an element in our array?
Example:
[code]
$noobs[0]=&quot;SWAT&quot;;
$noobs[1]=&quot;Kaex&quot;;
$noobs[2]=&quot;Somdude&quot;;

echo $noobs[0];

$noobs[0]=&quot;Kaex Owns SWAT :)&quot;;

echo $noobs[0];
[/code]

That would print...
SWAT Kaex Owns SWAT.

Because PHP reads from the top to bottom like a page in a book.
It reads in the exact way line after line.
That replaces arrays, but keeps all elements.

Now how would you do this in an associative array?
[code]
$noobs[&quot;bread&quot;]=&quot;toast&quot;;
[/code]
That would be place to the top of the array.

This may still be confusing and not much sense at all. But it will in the next couple
of parts.

[b]PART 15:[/b]
Arraying a loop:

This is going to get tricky now guys. So please pay close attention.
I figured this from playing around with PHP.

So lets create a simple array.
[code]
$noobs=array(&#39;SWAT&#39;,&#39;Kaex&#39;,&#39;Mendorphins&#39;,&#39;IlikeArrays&#39;);
[/code]

Now lets create a loop guys.
Remember it contains its own set of variables.
[code]
for($i=0; $i&lt;sizeof($noobs); $x++)

echo $noobs[$i]
[/code]
Size of automatically grabs what its asking.(noobs)

So now this will loop through the names, swat,kaex etc.
You may want to add &lt;br/&gt; and spaces to make it look better.
You should be familiar with loops, so I&#39;m not going to explain them.
If you don&#39;t understand loops currently, find the part containing them.


[b]PART 16[/b]
For-each loops, equiping array:

Example:
[code]
&lt;?php

$first=array(&#39;one&#39;,&#39;two&#39;,&#39;three&#39;);

foreach ($first as $i)
   echo $i
?&gt;
[/code]

This is alot simpler. Say you want to spit out all your elements in your array out.
What I did was, created a variable-array. Then added the foreach loop,
And all I had to do was foreach variable first print it, but we put &#39;as&#39;
basically the same as &#39;==&#39; equal to $i.

Then we just echo&#39;d it out on the screen using the variable, variable if you want to say that and it would have echo&#39;d it perfectly onto the screen. 
Very simple and easy syntax.

[b]PART 17:[/b]
Functions, the good stuff:

Now functions in PHP, arn&#39;t like functions in real life lol.
But in PHP functions are EXTREMELY usefull.
As usual I will show you an example of a function:
[code]
&lt;?php

function bytethree()
         {
         echo &quot;I&#39;m a function&quot;;
         }
[/code]

Now thats what a function looks like, its a name and an echo (I just used as an example)
But say we wanted to call that function 600000 lines down, too much effort to go up, but you suddenly remember the function name.

[code]
&lt;?php

function bytethree()
         {
         echo &quot;I&#39;m a function&quot;;
         }
bytethree();
[/code]
Thats basically it.
Just you need to know that you can use this function multiple times.
If you think carefully, this is extremely usefull.

[b]PART 18:[/b]
Functions, parameters:

In this part, we&#39;re going to be using them parameters:
[code]
&lt;?php

function bytethree($printme)
         {
         echo $printme.&quot;nooobs&quot;;
         }

bytethree(&quot;, hear me you&quot;);
bytethree(&quot; NOOBS&quot;);

?&gt;
[/code]

Now the parameter built a variable called print me.
Now in our function we called, is bytethree so its going to say:

&quot;nooobs&quot;.
But when we called it, we used the parameters, and they first say, hear me you.
So it going to print that because its equal to the variable.
Then we printed it again, but this time the variable printme taken another place.
&#39;NOOOBS&#39;.

Just use it and you&#39;ll understand.

[b]PART 19:[/b]
Returning a value, can be used for data:

Okay lets start by creating a function:

[code]
function bytethree($w, $i)
       {
       $total = $w + $i;
           return $total;
       }

echo bytethree(5,5);
[/code]

As you can see, we used the parameters again, but instead of 1 variable.
We created two variables.

Then in our function we named a variable $total, and set the equation.
Think of them as backwards equations. w + i = total
Aka, 5 + 5 = 10?
Because of the return, it returned the value.
Now when we echo&#39;d it. We used the parameters and just put numbers is.
They just follow in order, like I told you. PHP reads like a book, so what it see&#39;s first is going first.

Thats all for now, just test it learn it, remember what ever. Then move on to the next part!


[b]PART 20:[/b]
Forms, form? FORM?!?!:

We will be using simple html code, just bare with me until I test xhtml.
Create a new php file. Name it what ever you like.

There are two forms, get and post. We&#39;ll be learning post for now.

[code]

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;form action=&quot;Your other php file name.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
Name: &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;byte3&quot;/&gt;
&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

[/code]
Just test this.

we created &lt;form&gt; and made the actions come from our other php file.
Then we use the method &#39;post&#39;.
The name and then input type etc, egnure that for now.
Just focus on &lt;form&gt;.

And then its self explanatory, but when you come to submit it, its not going to do anything. Thats because in the otherpage we created, it has no actions sent.

[center]Picture just so you know what it should look like:
[IMG]http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/8001/picneeded.png[/img][/center]

Okay so lets finish this, we&#39;re going to need to create a &#39;script&#39;.

In test page, place this:
[code]
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;?php
echo $_POST[&quot;name&quot;];
?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
[/code]
What that does, is grab the post method. And look for the variable we created, &#39;name&#39;.
Now when you submit text, it will name the &#39;input&#39; and echo it back to you.
Basically its echoing what ever you type into the method.

I&#39;ll be doing the get method soon. Study up for now.</description>

You can’t learn PHP and teach it at the same time. What a ridiculous notion.</p>
<p>Blogging as you learn is not a problem, but telling people it will help them when your own understanding is sub-par. No, just no. This information is still new to you, so what on earth do you think qualifies you to teach PHP?<br>

<p>If this helps people learn PHP, whats the problem with it?[/quote]</p>
<p>Maths was the worse possible choice there since it is of course the only universal truth we can rely on.</p>
<p>You need to be experienced with something before you teach it, otherwise you just end up being a terrible teacher. <em>Finds evidence</em></p>
<blockquote>Before we start, this is solely for WINDOWS XP. Unless you have knowledge of where directorys are on any other.</blockquote> How ridiculous.
<blockquote>PHP tags are what explain your code in some sense, but you must also remember that PHP tag comes before HTML. Otherwise it won't work or something, I'm not sure.</blockquote> ...
<blockquote>You may use a syntax word echo that gives output text onto the green?</blockquote> WHAT?
<blockquote>Variable, complex maybe to you at the moment, but its not actually as hard as you may assume it is.
A variable is one that holds the place of another.</blockquote> Worse description of a variable, ever.
<p>I’ll just stop there, I don’t want to humiliate or insult you, but at the same time you are by no means ready to be attempting teaching this.</p>

              <p><span class="bbcode-b">Introduction:</span><br>
I’m not sure if this is the right section for PHP tutorials, just a guess, spam say I’m noob do what you like, I aim to help people:</p>
<p>I’ve decided to teach PHP and blog it as I go along learning it my self.<br>
You can spam, call me a noob say what ever, it really does’nt bother me.<br>
But if you actually want to learn PHP. Come here.<br>
I would also like to say that PHP seems to be very similar to Java, so if you have a fairly good knowledge<br>
of Java, you’ll be ok.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 1</span><br>
Downloading XAMPP:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href="http://google.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">google.co.uk</a> &gt; search xammp &gt; Apache friends, should be first link, or simply visit this link:<br>
<a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will have a list of mac, linux, windows etc etc… Choose what you run on, and download.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will give you options, service the following:<br>
MySQL<br>
Apache<br>
Filezilla.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you should have a little XAMMP icon on your desktop, or it may have open’d already.<br>
In this small box you should see ‘modules’ then ‘SVC’ under it tick all three boxes, but not mercurary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay so your probably going to type some little bits of php into your text editor and its not going to work, that because you need to start all 3 of the services (Only one for the php, but its best to do all).<br>
You will see admin and then on its right, start. Click all 3 starts and a little green box saying running will appear.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 2:</span><br>
How to local host a PHP file:</p>
<p>Before we start, this is solely for WINDOWS XP. Unless you have knowledge of where directorys are on any other.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Okay, so go to start &gt; My Computer &gt; Local Disk (C:/) &gt; [color=greenXAMPP[/color] &gt; htdocs<br>
And thats where you MUST save your work as .php, so go ahead and save a php file named mhmm…<br>
testpage.php</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put this into it and save testpage.php:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>&lt;?php
echo "Hello World"
?&gt;</code></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now go to your borswer, and put this into it:<br>
<a href="http://localhost/testpage.php" rel="nofollow noopener">http://localhost/testpage.php</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you must remember that you MUST always save your work there. Otherwise you will not be able to open it.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 3:</span><br>
Some of the basics:</p>
<p>I’ll be teaching you how to write php now.</p>
<p>To write in php, you need to ALWAYS start with a php tag<br>
Here is an example of a php tag:</p>
<p>[code]&lt;?php</p>
<p>blahblahlbah</p>
<p>?&gt;[/code]</p>
<p>PHP tags are what explain your code in some sense, but you must also remember that PHP tag comes before HTML. Otherwise it won’t work or something, I’m not sure.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 4:</span><br>
Text,numbers,variables:</p>
<p>Output is used variously through PHP, but there is also the concept of statements, whitch we’ll be getting into later.<br>
You may use a syntax word echo that gives output text onto the green?<br>
Here is a small example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php
	echo "See what I mean?";
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Echo canbe used for text or numbers, text will always need “-” but numbers, and I don’t know why don’t need “-”.<br>
Here is an example of an echo text and echo number.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">echo "This is what text should look like!";

echo 673673</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 4:</span><br>
Variables, text:</p>
<p>Variable, complex maybe to you at the moment, but its not actually as hard as you may assume it is.<br>
A variable is one that holds the place of another.<br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Door is another name for 567</code></pre>
<p>In this example instead of typing 567, you would type door, because that is the variable name? Its a little like math in school.<br>
Algebra. When say… 67 + x, x = 80 answer is: 147. the variable is x, because it holds the place of 80.</p>
<p>Now here is an example in php.<br>
In green, I will highlight the variable.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php

$example1 = "I'm a noob example";

?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now we’ve created a variable, but you might have tested it, and what do you know. It did’nt work.<br>
Remember the echo I shown you.<br>
You must use that, but instead oh typing echo - some text. You can type the variable name.<br>
Here an example, I’ll highlight in green what I mean.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php
$example1 = "Display me"

echo $example1

?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Go test that, get good at it. And move onto part 5.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 5</span><br>
Variables, joining:</p>
<p>Now I’m betting your confused when I said, variables, numbers? Well yes. This is literal algebra now <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> yay.<br>
Now say you created a variable and it contained a number?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$examplenumber = 6666;
$exampleone = 6635;</code></pre>
<p>If you want to put these two variables together, like… Unite them as one when it comes to output. Say you output variable examplenumber and you got 6666, you could have:<br>
6666 6635<br>
The way you join them together is when they’re echo’d you use a dot (.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">echo $example1.examplenumber;</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 6:</span><br>
Variables, math, numbers:</p>
<p>Lets get started,<br>
and please remember this is only basics. Your not pro yet ;).</p>
<p>Now here is a simple sum of adding two numbers together.<br>
I’d say this is learnable just from looking at it:<br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$imavariable = 100+10;

echo $imavariable;</code></pre>
<p>Or</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$imavariable = 100-10;

echo $imavariable;</code></pre>
<p>Now if you notice, numbers don’t use “-”, I don’t know why, I don’t know if they should. But thats how it is in PHP.</p>
<p>Now that is not the only way for you too add two variables together.</p>
<p>Heres an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$variableone = 100500;
$variabletwo = 555;

echo $variableone+$variabletwo;</code></pre>
<p>That small peice of code, will add the two variables together.<br>
It will go to variable one, oh variable one is 100500.<br>
Variable two, oh variable two is 555, lets add them together.</p>
<p>Okay so now I’m betting your wondering,</p>
<p>What multiply, whats divide?<br>
I’ll doc these down for you <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Plus:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">+</code></pre>
<p>Subtract:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-</code></pre>
<p>Multiply:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">*</code></pre>
<p>Set it equal too:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">==</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&amp;&amp;</code></pre>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 7:</span><br>
If, else, elseif:</p>
<p>What this statement is, well its the exact same as Java basically.<br>
It says If this, is this, if not do this…</p>
<p>Lets start create 3 variables:<br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$numberone = 100;
$numbertwo = 200;
$numberthree = 300;</code></pre>
<p>Now to explain the if statement.<br>
Heres an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if ($numberone&gt;$numbertwo)
	{echo "correct";}
else
	{echo "this is incorrect";}</code></pre>
<p>Pleae notice that your using <code> { } </code></p>
<p>Okay so at the top, its says… If number one, is bigger than number two</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">($numberone&gt;$numbertwo)</code></pre>
<p>Then we want it to echo (say) correct.<br>
else (otherwise)<br>
echo (say) it is incorrect.</p>
<p>The answer is incorrect because 100 is less than 200.<br>
But if you changes the variable number one too 200.<br>
And the variable 200 to 100, it would print correct.</p>
<p>Now for elseif statement.</p>
<p>Okay so create a variable.<br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$name = "Kaex";</code></pre>
<p>Okay so now we’re going to implement an if statement<br>
Notice the ==.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if ($name == "Kaex")
	echo "Welcome shit brains";
elseif ($name == "Noob")
	echo "You should'nt be here noob";</code></pre>
<p>You may keep on using elseif 100 times, or 1 billion times. Its allowed.</p>
<p>But you must end an elseif statement.<br>
How?<br>
You end it using the else. Otherwise it most likely will give you an error of somekind or just<br>
will not work at all. Never done it wrong so I’m not sure on that.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if ($name == "Kaex")
	echo "Welcome shit brains";
elseif ($name == "Noob")
	echo "You should'nt be here noob";
elseif ($name == "ThreeDaysGrace")
	echo "Hii sexy";
else
	echo "Who the f*ck is here?";</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the last statement is the else, that finishes the if,elseif statement.<br>
Where as a simple 2 option if statement does not require this.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 8:</span><br>
Switch statements:</p>
<p>Switch statements are commonly used in Java, but also PHP.<br>
I’d say they’re better than if statements…<br>
They use cases to test if the variable is true…<br>
Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
&lt;?php

$smoking = "you smoke";

switch ($smoking)
{
	case "you smoke":
		echo "Your a smoker";
		break;

	case "nonesmoker":
		echo "You don't smoke";
		break;
	default:
		echo "fail";
		break;
}

?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Okay so what this say is, smoking. You smoke currently.<br>
case yousmoke, if you smoke it will print your a smoker.<br>
If I was to change smokin to nonesmoker, it will print on the output<br>
you don’t smoke.</p>
<p>The default is like the else at the end of an ifstatement, it says if none of the above<br>
is tested true. Then print “fail”. You MUST always end a switch statement with<br>
default.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 9:</span><br>
While loops:</p>
<p>While loop, basically says it in its name. This will loop over and over if<br>
something is true. But once it becomes false, it stops the loop.</p>
<p>While loop is the most basic loop, I think.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a while loop, I’ll explain the code below it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
&lt;?php

$number = 1;

	while ($number&lt;=5)
		{
		echo $number. "&lt;br/&gt;";
			$number++;
		}
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The variable ‘number’ is equal too 1.<br>
This loop is saying;<br>
While the variable number is less than, or equal too 5.<br>
We want you too echo the variable ‘number’.<br>
Then after that, we want you to grab that variable number.<br>
And increate it by one, each time.<br>
<br> means add a break, its part of html.<br>
So what it will do is go…<br>
1<br>
2<br>
3<br>
4<br>
5<br>
And then because of the &lt;=5 it stops.</p>
<p>Hope this helped guys.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 10:</span><br>
‘Do’ loops:</p>
<p>This is another loop, this allows you to do an action ATLEAST one time, whether its true.<br>
Or false.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php

$number = 10;

do
	{
	$number++;
	echo $number. "&lt;br/&gt;;
	}
while ($number&gt;10);

?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>While the number is bigger than 10 or equal too, we want you to keep on printing number,<br>
after number, and number.</p>
<p>But if we changed it to this…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php

$number = 1;

do
	{
	$number++;
	echo $number. "&lt;br/&gt;;
	}
while ($number&lt;10);

?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It says, while number 1 is less than 10, we want you to print to 10.<br>
But in the middle you see, $number++;<br>
That means skip a number basically. Skip the first.</p>
<p>And thats all for do loops.  Get good at this, and move on to part 11.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 11:</span><br>
For loops:<br>
This is a ‘for’ loop, the is the last loop of the 3.</p>
<p>This allows the execution of a certain condition as many times as you like.<br>
Here is an example of the ‘for’ loop:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php
for ($number=1; $number&lt;=5; $number++)
	{
	echo "Hellow sexy Kaex"."&lt;br/&gt;";
	}
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This will print Hello sexy Kaex 5 times, why?<br>
The variable number is equal to 1. Then it says, if number is less than or equal<br>
to 5. Print. But we incremented number++, and that basically adds one.<br>
Here is an equation of how it would work:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">1, 5-1 = 4, number++ = 1. 4+1 = 5.</code></pre>
<p>Printing it 5 times.</p>
<p>Now if you still don’t understand this, cause it is tricky.<br>
I’m going to change the numbers.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php
for ($number=2; $number&lt;=5; $number++)
	{
	echo "Hellow sexy Kaex"."&lt;br/&gt;";
	}
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now here we see the number is 2?<br>
But as long as it is less than or equal to 5. It will print.<br>
So 5-2 is obviously 3. But on the end there is number++.<br>
So you add 1 onto the 3. Leaving us with 4. Simple?<br>
If you still need help just post a comment and I’ll explain it in greater detail.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 12:</span><br>
ARRAYS!!!:</p>
<p>Many of you who do Java will be familiar with the concept and purpose of an ‘array’.<br>
In PHP they did the syntax a little stupidly, for the noobs learning. Just follow me as I go along.</p>
<p>An array allows multiple shit stored in one value.<br>
I shown you guys variables.<br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> $name = "boobie";</code></pre>
<p>But an array can store multiple values?<br>
Here is an example of an array, they’re easy. Trust me:<br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$noobs=array ('SWAT' ,'Kaex','Somedude');</code></pre>
<p>Now in arrays the computer always starts at 0, no idea why but thats how it is so…<br>
SWAT = 0<br>
KAEX = 1<br>
SOMEDUDE = 2</p>
<p>But say you wanted execute a variable in an array.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$noobs=array ('SWAT' ,'Kaex','Somedude');

$noobs[1]</code></pre>
<p>That would be equal to Kaex?<br>
If that was echo’d, it would print Kaex.</p>
<p>The second way to write them is like this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$noobs[0]="SWAT";</code></pre>
<p>Now to use part of the array in an echo, just an example of an execution.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">echo $noobs[1];</code></pre>
<p>Please read this over carefully. Make sure you understand this.<br>
They’re EXTREMELY usefull.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 13:</span><br>
Associative Arrays: (I’m not sure if thats its name)</p>
<p>So what these do basically is…<br>
I’ll show an example first:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$food=array('bread'=&gt;'toast','nipples'=&gt;'boobies');

echo $food['bread'];</code></pre>
<p>Now that says bread is equal to, toast?(bread/toast are called elements)<br>
So when I echo’d bread. It would output toast.<br>
Basically same as arrays, just you don’t use<br>
[0]<br>
[1]<br>
[2]<br>
[3]<br>
Its simple. I think thats pretty self explanatory from there. If you need any help. Post a comment!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 14:</span><br>
Modification of arrays:</p>
<p>Welcome to part 14 of your PHP learning.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$noobs[0]="SWAT";
$noobs[1]="Kaex";
$noobs[2]="Somdude";

echo $noobs[0];</code></pre>
<p>Simple array.<br>
But say you have a LONGASS string of arrays.<br>
And you did’nt know the number for the last one.<br>
You could use…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$noobs []="Mendorphins";</code></pre>
<p>Leaving empty brackets will just add it onto the end.</p>
<p>But then lets say we want to create a new element to replace an element in our array?<br>
Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$noobs[0]="SWAT";
$noobs[1]="Kaex";
$noobs[2]="Somdude";

echo $noobs[0];

$noobs[0]="Kaex Owns SWAT :)";

echo $noobs[0];</code></pre>
<p>That would print…<br>
SWAT Kaex Owns SWAT.</p>
<p>Because PHP reads from the top to bottom like a page in a book.<br>
It reads in the exact way line after line.<br>
That replaces arrays, but keeps all elements.</p>
<p>Now how would you do this in an associative array?</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$noobs["bread"]="toast";</code></pre>
<p>That would be place to the top of the array.</p>
<p>This may still be confusing and not much sense at all. But it will in the next couple<br>
of parts.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 15:</span><br>
Arraying a loop:</p>
<p>This is going to get tricky now guys. So please pay close attention.<br>
I figured this from playing around with PHP.</p>
<p>So lets create a simple array.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">$noobs=array('SWAT','Kaex','Mendorphins','IlikeArrays');</code></pre>
<p>Now lets create a loop guys.<br>
Remember it contains its own set of variables.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">for($i=0; $i&lt;sizeof($noobs); $x++)

echo $noobs[$i]</code></pre>
<p>Size of automatically grabs what its asking.(noobs)</p>
<p>So now this will loop through the names, swat,kaex etc.<br>
You may want to add <br> and spaces to make it look better.<br>
You should be familiar with loops, so I’m not going to explain them.<br>
If you don’t understand loops currently, find the part containing them.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 16</span><br>
For-each loops, equiping array:</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php

$first=array('one','two','three');

foreach ($first as $i)
   echo $i
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This is alot simpler. Say you want to spit out all your elements in your array out.<br>
What I did was, created a variable-array. Then added the foreach loop,<br>
And all I had to do was foreach variable first print it, but we put ‘as’<br>
basically the same as ‘==’ equal to $i.</p>
<p>Then we just echo’d it out on the screen using the variable, variable if you want to say that and it would have echo’d it perfectly onto the screen.<br>
Very simple and easy syntax.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 17:</span><br>
Functions, the good stuff:</p>
<p>Now functions in PHP, arn’t like functions in real life lol.<br>
But in PHP functions are EXTREMELY usefull.<br>
As usual I will show you an example of a function:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php

function bytethree()
         {
         echo "I'm a function";
         }</code></pre>
<p>Now thats what a function looks like, its a name and an echo (I just used as an example)<br>
But say we wanted to call that function 600000 lines down, too much effort to go up, but you suddenly remember the function name.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php

function bytethree()
         {
         echo "I'm a function";
         }
bytethree();</code></pre>
<p>Thats basically it.<br>
Just you need to know that you can use this function multiple times.<br>
If you think carefully, this is extremely usefull.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 18:</span><br>
Functions, parameters:</p>
<p>In this part, we’re going to be using them parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;?php

function bytethree($printme)
         {
         echo $printme."nooobs";
         }

bytethree(", hear me you");
bytethree(" NOOBS");

?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now the parameter built a variable called print me.<br>
Now in our function we called, is bytethree so its going to say:</p>
<p>“nooobs”.<br>
But when we called it, we used the parameters, and they first say, hear me you.<br>
So it going to print that because its equal to the variable.<br>
Then we printed it again, but this time the variable printme taken another place.<br>
‘NOOOBS’.</p>
<p>Just use it and you’ll understand.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 19:</span><br>
Returning a value, can be used for data:</p>
<p>Okay lets start by creating a function:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">function bytethree($w, $i)
       {
       $total = $w + $i;
           return $total;
       }

echo bytethree(5,5);</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we used the parameters again, but instead of 1 variable.<br>
We created two variables.</p>
<p>Then in our function we named a variable $total, and set the equation.<br>
Think of them as backwards equations. w + i = total<br>
Aka, 5 + 5 = 10?<br>
Because of the return, it returned the value.<br>
Now when we echo’d it. We used the parameters and just put numbers is.<br>
They just follow in order, like I told you. PHP reads like a book, so what it see’s first is going first.</p>
<p>Thats all for now, just test it learn it, remember what ever. Then move on to the next part!</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">PART 20:</span><br>
Forms, form? FORM?!?!:</p>
<p>We will be using simple html code, just bare with me until I test xhtml.<br>
Create a new php file. Name it what ever you like.</p>
<p>There are two forms, get and post. We’ll be learning post for now.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;form action="Your other php file name.php" method="post"&gt;
Name: &lt;input type="text" name="byte3"/&gt;
&lt;input type="submit"/&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Just test this.</p>
<p>we created  and made the actions come from our other php file.<br>
Then we use the method ‘post’.<br>
The name and then input type etc, egnure that for now.<br>
Just focus on .</p>
<p>And then its self explanatory, but when you come to submit it, its not going to do anything. Thats because in the otherpage we created, it has no actions sent.</p>
<p>[center]Picture just so you know what it should look like:<br>
<img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/8001/picneeded.png" alt width="" height="">[/center]</p>
<p>Okay so lets finish this, we’re going to need to create a ‘script’.</p>
<p>In test page, place this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;?php
echo $_POST["name"];
?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>What that does, is grab the post method. And look for the variable we created, ‘name’.<br>
Now when you submit text, it will name the ‘input’ and echo it back to you.<br>
Basically its echoing what ever you type into the method.</p>
<p>I’ll be doing the get method soon. Study up for now.</p>
