    <description>Hi, I can&#39;t figure out how to make a server with all the things I want in it. Too complicated for me. So, I decided to have somebody else do it, for a Co-Admin spot on my server. I have an AIM and a YAHOO account to give you the ideas I want for my server. Or we can talk here on the forums. Either way. I&#39;m giving everybody who has some pretty good skills when it comes to making private servers.
