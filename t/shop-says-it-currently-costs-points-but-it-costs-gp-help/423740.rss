    <description>Hey, The shop says it currently costs points but it costs GP I added the shop myself I just put the code in actionhandler now it is saying it currently costs 0 points when it costs GP. Please help me fix this as my players annoy the f*** out of me because of some bugs. And I don&#39;t want to get rude to them as they will quit and my server population is quite low.

Thanks, Mr Rushed</description>
