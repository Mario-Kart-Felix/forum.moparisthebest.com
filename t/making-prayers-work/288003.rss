    <title>Making prayers work?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/making-prayers-work/288003</link>
    <description>Well yeah,
I want to get all the prayers work- but firstly would like the protect prayers to work, and for the correct symbol to come above your head.
E.G Protect from melee will protect from any melee monsters, and against other players will js act as like 20%? or w/e because i don&#39;t want it to block melee in Pking.
I will be VERY grateful to anyone who helps.
