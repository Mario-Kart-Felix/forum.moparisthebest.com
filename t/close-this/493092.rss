    <description>Good evening,

I&#39;ve running a PI source wich is 317 i tough...
When I was downloading this source, i did not know its work was &quot;half&quot; done.
Alot of things not in server, e.g. Only Chaos, kbd, and 1 dag as bosses, Fm was disabled.., When wearing masks it came into weapon slot, etc etc.

I Fixed alot of things right now, and have made alot of edits and improvements..:)

Now I need you guys with something I need in this server aswell:

Slayer Master..

When i spawn Duradel, it is invisible.. I spawned a wizard named: wizard Frumscone, and when I talked to him, he only says:

Duradel = name in chatbox
Hello!
My name is Duradel and I am a master of the slayer skill.
I can assign you a slayer task suitable to your combat level.
Would you like a slayer task?
Click here to continue

But when i click; Click here to continue,

its freezes on: Please wait...
I can cancel it by walking away


So this all means;

My Slayer master its NpcID = 460 ( Wizard Frumscone )
1. I need this to be NpcID = 1599 ( Duradel )

And my Slayer skill needs to be Fixed/repaired/New Maded.

Does anyone knows something about this, or can anyone help?

I hope that i gave you guys enough of information

<p>I was just telling you that you will not find a source out there that isn’t completed. But complaining about my post being spam won’t help your problem. If you have actual Java knowledge, you would be able to fix these things. But it seems you don’t. I’d advise you to do so.</p>
