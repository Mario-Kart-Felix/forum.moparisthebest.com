<p>I had a credit list. In both my client folder, And my source folder, I added the names cause I don’t want people saying “Ah I saw this in “blablabla”'s post to, leecher”</p>
<p>I atleast give people credit.</p>
<p>And when I think about it, the server’s witch do not give credits are just leeches.<br>
Cause they’r taken from alot of diffrent servers.</p>
<ul>
<li>

</ul>
<p>The pest control:</p>
<p>I am working on it, and no, it’s not 100% delta. Cause I made that if you use full Void Knight armour you hit higher on portals.<br>
I made them heal it’self when they get 10% hp below.</p>
<p>Im trying to find the pest control npc’s and i’ve posted a topic in the help section for npc’ on npc.</p>

Looks cool, I’ll pm you some tuts if you’d like, going more into NPC drops (such as dropping bones 100% and then another random item).<br>
Maybe you could make a tut about quests? Because im struggling with them.</p>
<p>But yeah, it looks very good. The only thing I was concerned about was the prices. Are those the prices in shops? And if yes, then you shouldn’t really have those good items in shops. If no, are those gonna be the street prices when the server comes out?</p>
<p>Sucks about RS though. My first account got banned when I was swearing at people at cw, and I thought one report = BAN HAMMER. But lots of people said “reported!” to me, and I didn’t get banned so I’m like “HAHA you can’t BAN ME!!!”. I thought that banning was a rumor but I guess it wasnt :P. So yeah, I was swearing at people at cw ALL THE TIME. Everytime we were losing, I was like “Stupid asssholes go die!”<br>
Ass with 3 S’s wasn’t blocked then, so yeah…</p>
<p>So then when I got banned, it said my account has been “disabled”. I thought this was a bug. I told my mom and shes like “IDK.” I was sitting there for 3 hours and I didn’t figure anything out. Then I thought “Oh shit maybe im banned?” My friend told me its easy as hell to get back a banned account, so I was like “Yeah, there’s probably a form you have to fill out”.</p>
<p>Turns out my account was PERMANENTLY BANNED. I was like “WTF!!! WHY!”</p>
<p>So 2 or 3 years later (that was 2008) I try to recover him and I actually get him unbanned. Im like “Wtf… I thought I was perm?” But no, I logged on <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> and it was like 800 days later. I shit my pants at that sight. But he’s still perm mute. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
