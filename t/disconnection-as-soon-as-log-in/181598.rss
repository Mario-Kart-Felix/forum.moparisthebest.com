    <description>ok, so i decded to make a server..

I have changed alot of things and deleted all npcs etc.
Now, though when i log in it says player already logged in, then  i click login again and it comes on, says &quot;welcome to (myserver)&quot; and the ither welcome msgs....

Then it says loading - please wait.
I&#39;t now does not change untill i exit the moparscape client.

Here is what &quot;runserver.bat&quot; Says for all this......




[code](myservername)
-------------------------------------------------------
Loading npcs... drops... spawn list...done!
Connection from localhost:1065
[client-1-admin]: Loading Process Completed  [Has powers, lag: 63 ms]
ClientHandler: Client null disconnected (localhost)
Connection from localhost:1066
[client-1-admin]: Loading Process Completed  [Has powers, lag: 0 ms]
ClientHandler: Client null disconnected (localhost)
Connection from localhost:1067
[client-1-admin]: Loading Process Completed  [Has powers, lag: 0 ms]
Client lost connection: timeout
[client-1-admin]: Logout
ClientHandler: Client admin disconnected (localhost)[/code]

How would i prevent this from happening?
Is this because the player has turned null?

Please answer asap so i can continue with my server.</description>

Um, you probally put a space in a cfg file. Its not saying anything, but its all the same effects. With the Loading Screen and what not. What ever CFG file you edited, go to it, hit Control + f, and in the box, put a space. Then search threw. Its going to take a while, becuase its laid out like</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">spawn = 4924</code></pre>
<p>With the 2 spaces there, but before and after the = sign should be the only spaces.</p>
