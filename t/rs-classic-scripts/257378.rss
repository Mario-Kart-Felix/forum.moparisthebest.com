<p>RS2 was finally released, and Kaitnieks created another CDE. This one was nothing like AutoRune as it could not directly communicate with the server. The new program was a simple color clicker.

Although Kaitnieks didn’t know it yet, SCAR would be one of the longest standing RuneScape bots.</p>
<p>SCAR was being constantly updated with more and more features including text, bitmap and DTM recognition. Thousands of free scripts were available to download and use. The wide variety of scripts attracted hundreds of players to SCAR.</p>
<p>Some other bots were also released around that time. Some of these were RSBot (recreated), SBot, Aryan, along few others. Most of them died off after a while.</p>
<p>Kaitnieks eventually decided to leave the RuneScape scene. Before he left, he published the source code to SCAR. Customized clients started becoming a big thing at the time, and people began creating their own RuneScape servers. Still, SCAR was the last standing macro left for RuneScape.</p>

1.8. Q. What is Silent Mouse?</p>
<p>A. If the ‘Silent Mouse’ option is on, whenever a script makes the mouse move and/or click, your mouse pointer will not actually move. This is highly detectable in RS 2, but was great for <span class="bbcode-b">RS Classic</span>, because you could run several autoing programs at once.</p>
<p>[/quote][/quote]</p>
<p>haha omg, my Scar FAQ still exists!!!</p>
<p>as for RSC scripts… they do exist… but it would be hard to find good ones that work, since its not easy to get an acount that can play RSC to test them on</p>

<p>SCAR came out after AutoRune died. SCAR was originally for rsc. Don’t be retarded, RSC is an old game. Moron.</p>
