    <description>[center][COLOR=Orange]Welcome to #1 Free to Play Player  VS Player[/COLOR]

[COLOR=White]SERVER STATUS:[/COLOR][COLOR=Green]ONLINE[/COLOR]
HomePage: [url=http://free2play.zapto.org]http://free2play.zapto.org[/url]

With the new combat coming out, I thought there will be no more f2p pvp.  I like more the free to play combat style then the members pvp style. So I started working on this project. On my server you will gain  access only on the free to play map. Same it goes with the items and monsters. I added some Bosses, some of them are really hard if you take in consider the best defence gear is Full rune. 

At the moment I only added two high level monsters(bosses) and that&#39;s Elvarg and Evil Chicken. Future will be fallowed by Demon (from the Demon Slayer Quest), Rock Golem(random event), Tree Spirit (random event), Dr. Ford(random event) and  Zombie (random event).

ALL BUT ALL CONTENT IS 100% FREE TO PLAY
COMBAT TRAINING,SKILLS,ITEMS,MONSTERS,LOCATIONS,PVP WILD ZONE

COMBAT AND SKILL XP Rate will be high but be aware, the gold making in this game will be a pain in the ass. Because server will need a good economy so it can compete with the PVP drops. SO you can make money doing f2p skills or from pvp.

<p>-CLIENT V2 DOWNLOAD FROM: <a href="http://www.free2play.zapto.org" rel="nofollow noopener">www.free2play.zapto.org</a></p>
<p>-Skill Capes (I added skill capes they are all 0 in defence, so It dose not ruin the pure f2p pvp)</p>
<p>-Genie Lamp (The genie lamp let’s you train all the skills from combat to f2p skills, the price for 1 lamp is 1 honor point or 1 vote point. As some players know , you get 5 vote points per vote and 3 honor points per player killed, hope anti skiller’s find this useful)</p>
<p>-Instant Combat Training (You have the option to select Master/Pure, Every player that logs in from today will get a lamp, this lamp will help you get ur 1 time Master or Pure Combat Levels more info in-game)</p>
<p>-Gypsy Shop in Varrock Center( You can buy limproots and red spiders eggs at the price of 300 gp, you can take this two ingredients to the Varrock apothecary and you will get Strength_potion(4) and you can sell it for 1k gold each at any general store, or higher price to the players, this is a good way of making money there are no strength potion in stores)</p>
<p>-Guide Book Beta(you will find it at every general store)</p>
<p>-2nd Day Reward( you will get rewarded after 24h with 100k if you log in back)</p>
<p>-All Monsters,Bosses removed until Future news</p>
<p>-Crafting (Is now possible by getting uncut gems from mining rocks, during mining of course or train it via Genie Lamp)</p>
<p>-Fixed the Crashing client ( you will not get dc’ed anymore 100% up time working from client)</p>
<p>-Instant Pk (with Da Vinci Instant Leveling)</p>
<p>Please feel free to start playing again and report any bugs you find from this moment, all old bugs have been fixed.</p>
<p>I am open to suggestions.</p>
<p>Future Updates:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cash Bags</li>
