<p>Ed my point is that if RSCE can get past the rules then what is the issue with a different server attempting to gain a player base? I guess you can say I am asking how can it hurt, seeing as the RSCE player base will not disperse or be disregarded anytime soon it seems unjust to assume the fact that this server is breaking the rules. If anything it is none of your business even though you like to come up with an answer for everything constantly acting as a citizens on patrol would (I.E. eldery people on community watch in america).</p>

<p>One again i understand your concern Edward but you are missing out on the biggest point which is if you are going to slander this server and its representation then why not slander RSCE? You talk big but I see no walking, therefore my assumptions are completely valid.</p>
<p>If you have any other concerns feel free to pm me as this is ridiculous ruining a thread with us gallivanting around acting as if we have any control what so ever over the server. If this post gets deleted we demand RSCE gets taken down as well… and what does that mean? No RSC server advertisement on this forum due to rules that are completely obscene.</p>
<p>Thank you, come again.</p>

<p>[quote author=Chrix link=topic=643871.msg4333779#msg4333779 date=1374027626]I understand what you’re saying but you must realize it stands for Permanent Player 2 Player rather than Project Player 2 Player.[/quote]Lol, no. Both are Project P2P. The word permanent isn’t the first one for either.</p>
<p>[quote author=Chrix link=topic=643871.msg4333779#msg4333779 date=1374027626]This is not the original source for PP2P nor is it in any means complete. It is currently in the beta stage and we have a lot of work to improve on the server not including becoming exactly like PP2P nor any other server.[/quote]Same goes for other Stork servers… You’re trying to get the mods to behave inconsistently, just because you like this server.</p>
<p>[quote author=Chrix link=topic=643871.msg4333779#msg4333779 date=1374027626]If you are the side of deleting this post then I have every right to assume you are more in terms of keeping RSCE the only server on mopar as you bash every post outside of RSCE itself… I remember in the past you were against Matts logic of selling rares for IRL cash, and now you basically are supporting Pyru who is acting the same ideal.[/quote]That’s not true. I’ve taken many issues with RSCE and other servers that are breaking the rules or have something that users should be aware of.</p>
<p>Also, it’s quite obvious that I’m 100% against what Pyru is doing, and I’ve taken it up with several mods, and have messaged admins, who haven’t responded.</p>
<p>[quote author=Chrix link=topic=643871.msg4333779#msg4333779 date=1374027626]Makes me sick Ed… really.[/quote]What makes me sick is that you’re blatantly misrepresenting what I stand for, in an attempt to vilify me. All I’m trying to do is keep the moderators acting in a consistent manner, whereas you want this server to have special treatment, just because you like it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ed my point is that if RSCE can get past the rules then what is the issue with a different server attempting to gain a player base? I guess you can say I am asking how can it hurt, seeing as the RSCE player base will not disperse or be disregarded anytime soon it seems unjust to assume the fact that this server is breaking the rules. If anything it is none of your business even though you like to come up with an answer for everything constantly acting as a citizens on patrol would (I.E. eldery people on community watch in america).</p>
<p>I will ask you once and only once to leave this thread as all you are doing is bringing negativity into it, thanks buddy hope you have a good one &lt;3.<br>
[/quote]You act as if I think it’s right that RSCE gets to break the rules… I don’t think it’s right, but that doesn’t mean every other server should be allowed to break them as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’m not assuming that it’s breaking the rules… It is banned from being advertised here; therefore advertising it here is breaking the rules.</p>
<p>As for bringing negativity into it, of course I’m not going to stop. This thread shouldn’t exist in the first place, and should be deleted like the other two posted this week.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>One again i understand your concern Edward but you are missing out on the biggest point which is if you are going to slander this server and its representation then why not slander RSCE? You talk big but I see no walking, therefore my assumptions are completely valid.</p>
<p>If you have any other concerns feel free to pm me as this is ridiculous ruining a thread with us gallivanting around acting as if we have any control what so ever over the server. If this post gets deleted we demand RSCE gets taken down as well… and what does that mean? No RSC server advertisement on this forum due to rules that are completely obscene.</p>
<p>Thank you, come again.[/quote]How am I slandering the server when this thread is in direct violation of a decision an admin made? I didn’t say the owner is doing anything wrong, other than posting this thread. I didn’t say the server is shit. You’re simply trying to vilify me because you like this server, it’s blatantly obvious and just makes you look like an idiot.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have spoken out against RSCE on numerous occasions, and I’ve been threatened by a staff member every single time I speak out about it, in the thread. In addition, my posts are continually deleted, even though I was merely providing constructive critisim.</p>
<p>As for demanding RSCE be taken down, that is entirely unrelated to this issue. The issue at hand is that this is an advertisement for a server that is banned from being advertised. An admin has not banned RSCE yet, and therefore is in an entirely different stage in the process.</p>
