<p>Also, it’s quite obvious that I’m 100% against what Pyru is doing, and I’ve taken it up with several mods, and have messaged admins, who haven’t responded.</p>

All I’m trying to do is keep the moderators acting in a consistent manner, whereas you want this server to have special treatment, just because you like it.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Ed my point is that if RSCE can get past the rules then what is the issue with a different server attempting to gain a player base? I guess you can say I am asking how can it hurt, seeing as the RSCE player base will not disperse or be disregarded anytime soon it seems unjust to assume the fact that this server is breaking the rules. If anything it is none of your business even though you like to come up with an answer for everything constantly acting as a citizens on patrol would (I.E. eldery people on community watch in america).</p>
<p>I will ask you once and only once to leave this thread as all you are doing is bringing negativity into it, thanks buddy hope you have a good one &lt;3.<br>
[/quote]You act as if I think it’s right that RSCE gets to break the rules… I don’t think it’s right, but that doesn’t mean every other server should be allowed to break them as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’m not assuming that it’s breaking the rules… It is banned from being advertised here; therefore advertising it here is breaking the rules.</p>
<p>As for bringing negativity into it, of course I’m not going to stop. This thread shouldn’t exist in the first place, and should be deleted like the other two posted this week.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>One again i understand your concern Edward but you are missing out on the biggest point which is if you are going to slander this server and its representation then why not slander RSCE? You talk big but I see no walking, therefore my assumptions are completely valid.</p>
<p>If you have any other concerns feel free to pm me as this is ridiculous ruining a thread with us gallivanting around acting as if we have any control what so ever over the server. If this post gets deleted we demand RSCE gets taken down as well… and what does that mean? No RSC server advertisement on this forum due to rules that are completely obscene.</p>
<p>Thank you, come again.[/quote]How am I slandering the server when this thread is in direct violation of a decision an admin made? I didn’t say the owner is doing anything wrong, other than posting this thread. I didn’t say the server is shit. You’re simply trying to vilify me because you like this server, it’s blatantly obvious and just makes you look like an idiot.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have spoken out against RSCE on numerous occasions, and I’ve been threatened by a staff member every single time I speak out about it, in the thread. In addition, my posts are continually deleted, even though I was merely providing constructive critisim.</p>
<p>As for demanding RSCE be taken down, that is entirely unrelated to this issue. The issue at hand is that this is an advertisement for a server that is banned from being advertised. An admin has not banned RSCE yet, and therefore is in an entirely different stage in the process.</p>

<p>Ed my point is that if RSCE can get past the rules then what is the issue with a different server attempting to gain a player base? I guess you can say I am asking how can it hurt, seeing as the RSCE player base will not disperse or be disregarded anytime soon it seems unjust to assume the fact that this server is breaking the rules.

<p>I will ask you once and only once to leave this thread as all you are doing is bringing negativity into it, thanks buddy hope you have a good one &lt;3.[/quote]You act as if I think it’s right that RSCE gets to break the rules… I don’t think it’s right, but that doesn’t mean every other server should be allowed to break them as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’m not assuming that it’s breaking the rules… It is banned from being advertised here; therefore advertising it here is breaking the rules.</p>
<p>As for bringing negativity into it, of course I’m not going to stop. This thread shouldn’t exist in the first place, and should be deleted like the other two posted this week.</p>

<p>Edward, first and foremost that was a post regarding MATT’s server PP2P over 4 years ago. Clearly this is a offshoot of it ran by somebody other than MATT and this server is incomplete in beta mode. So please explain how this server is the same as MATT’s server? Thanks.</p>
<p>EDIT: They deleted Matts PP2P post due to him selling items for irl cash, isn’t Pyru doing the same? Gtfo.<br>
[/quote]Project P2P is banned, just like Stork PK… Stork was banned for DDoSing and such, but it always gets removed, even with different owners. And Stork was banned before Project P2P, so time since it was banned means nothing.</p>
<p>As for the reasoning, that PP2P was banned and RSCE isn’t, you’re going to have to take that up with the admins. I’ve pointed out that donations breaks rule 8, which includes: “This includes offering ‘rewards’ for donations or anything like that.” But, I’ve always been ignored.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’d like to see some actual evidence that it isn’t run by Matt… He’s come back to the community several times, which is one of the reasons why I’m not believing that it isn’t Matt or someone else who is banned from advertising here.</p>

</aside>
<p>I understand your logic edward but I fail to comprehend the logic of the board rules when it comes down to different owners taking a previous servers name. It’s been five years since pp2p was gone and me and you have been through a lot, so I request you leave this up to a moderator or admin to decide the fate so I can fight it.</p>
<p>Some things on this board are obviously blown out of proportion and all I request is equality between servers, If RSCE is up and breaking the rules every day… why turn down a new server with a great owner with a goal and great intentions? It seems to be very contradicting nowadays.[/quote]It has been left up to the staff to decide, which is why it was deleted twice already… I don’t have the ability to lock or delete threads, only staff members do.</p>
<p>Also, it is perfectly logical to ban servers that are banned… The only reason new people open up a new server is to piggyback off the name or for the original owner to open it again under a new alias.</p>
<p>As for why they’re removing this, it’s because the server is banned from advertising. If he wanted to make a truly new server, nobody would have batted an eye, but he’s trying to piggyback off of Project P2P, to the point where he’s even stealing the name, which is banned.</p>

<p>Edward, first and foremost that was a post regarding MATT’s server PP2P over 4 years ago. Clearly this is a offshoot of it ran by somebody other than MATT and this server is incomplete in beta mode. So please explain how this server is the same as MATT’s server? Thanks.</p>
<p>EDIT: They deleted Matts PP2P post due to him selling items for irl cash, isn’t Pyru doing the same? Gtfo.[/quote]Project P2P is banned, just like Stork PK… Stork was banned for DDoSing and such, but it always gets removed, even with different owners. And Stork was banned before Project P2P, so time since it was banned means nothing.</p>
<p>As for the reasoning, that PP2P was banned and RSCE isn’t, you’re going to have to take that up with the admins. I’ve pointed out that donations breaks rule 8, which includes: “This includes offering ‘rewards’ for donations or anything like that.” But, I’ve always been ignored.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I’d like to see some actual evidence that it isn’t run by Matt… He’s come back to the community several times, which is one of the reasons why I’m not believing that it isn’t Matt or someone else who is banned from advertising here.</p>
