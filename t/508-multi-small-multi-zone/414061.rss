    <title>[508] Multi Small Multi Zone?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-multi-small-multi-zone/414061</link>
    <description>Hey! I have had this problem for so long. What I need is someone to help me with this multi zone crap. I get all the coords and stuff but I dont know where to put them. I know it goes in the player.java and theres a place to put the coords but there is a certain spot for the 2 x coords and 2 y coords and I don&#39;t know which one goes where. Heres the Player.java code.

[code]public boolean multiwayCombatZone(int x, int y) {
        return (x &lt; 3447 &amp;&amp; x &gt; 3189 &amp;&amp; y &gt;3433 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 3461);
}[/code]

The coords are supposed to be the back of the Varrock west bank the side closest to the ge. I just want it Behind that bank not as far as the g.e and to the side of it where the tree is and it ends there. Anyone please help? 

My msn is jason-gbg@@live.com

I prefer skype. Thanks for anyone who helps or tries.</description>

              <p>All that function does is tell you if you’re within those coordinates. You have to actually have some code that does what you want it to do, using that function.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<p><code>public boolean multiwayCombatZone(int x, int y) {
	return (x &lt; 3447 &amp;&amp; x &gt; 3189 &amp;&amp; y &gt;3433 &amp;&amp; y &lt; 3461);
}</code></p>
<p>Also, please try to use the [nobbc]<code></code>[/nobbc] tag in the future for your in post code.</p>
