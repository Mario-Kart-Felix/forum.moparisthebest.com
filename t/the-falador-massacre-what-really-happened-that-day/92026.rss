    <title>The falador massacre - What really happened that day</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-falador-massacre-what-really-happened-that-day/92026</link>
    <description>Many people never really knew what surely happened that day.  Well. Here it is.

On 6 June of 2006 a terrible event happened what players now know as the Falador Massacre. On this day, a glitch was found that everyone can attack player outside the wilderness. Many people lost a lot of valuable items and many people got banned that day. How could something happened like this? How could Jagex make such a big mistake?

I will explain what happened that day…

Cursed_you was close to getting lvl 99 construction. He was the very fist person that got lvl 99 and for this special event he made a house party at his home. A lot of people came to see his house. Most of them went to the dungeon where you can kill players. After a while Cursed_you had enough and expelled everybody out of his house.

Then disaster struck…

A bug in the game that nobody, not even Jagex could imagine created total chaos everywhere in world 111. 

When Cursed_you expelled everyone, so many people were expelled at once that the game couldn’t handle the amount. People were still able to attack other players after getting out of Cursed_you’s house. 

A lot of players saw an opportunity to get rich very fast and started killing everyone on sight. A skiller with a party hat could only watch how he got killed and lost something that he worked many years for.

A pker called Durial321 was one of the most remarkable killers on this day. He went on a rampage and started killing everyone with good stuff on. He used ancient magicks and a lot of people died of the powerful spells he casted. 

Other players started killing too and chaos was everywhere. Jagex and player Moderators rushed to the scene trying to warn as much players as possible to log out and bank items as fast a possible. Of course it was already to late before a large amount of damage was dealt.</description>
