    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pk-points-and-automatic-pk-point-shop-delta/348796</link>
    <description>okay i saw this off a server pk planet i want to add it to my server it looks cool but idk how to add these and i dont want to do it and mess up alot and get over 100 errors so im going to decide to ask these are the things i need help with.

1. i want to add pk points it shows that it has pk points but dont think it works but its in the skill tabs and it&#39;s at the bottom by the combat level and says pk. I want to give every time you kill a person(differnt ip if its not hard) you get 2 pk points.

2.I want a automatic pk point you type ::rewards and then like a command thing pops up that shows what you can do and it list all these commands (e.g ::vls and you get vls and takes like 200 points from your pk points)if you need a list of  the rewads i want im not sure if you do post a comment that you do and ill post them.
