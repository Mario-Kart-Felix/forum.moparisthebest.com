    <description>i have paypal ipn, and i wanted to know how to make something that automaticly sends a generated code to the buyer. to use this generated code you need to log in and type it in on my server. then this will spawn or give you the item or donator status you paid for. and how would i make so the server knows what to give the buyer when you type the generated code.</description>

              <p>First you could create about 100 Differnt Codes<br>
and then have it delete the Code from the data base when they type the command in.<br>
Pretty simple unsure how to do it on PI but delta you could more or less do the same thing as a unban command Just remove from data base but check to see if command = any of the command lines in there. Unsure but there are ways to set up pay pal to send them a code back when they buy something.</p>
