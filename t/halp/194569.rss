    <description>How can I make it so it doesn&#39;t encrypt the passwords? I&#39;m not trying to hack people or anything because if I was I&#39;d download another server that doesn&#39;t have the encryption. I need it because when somebody changes there password with ::pass it changes it without the encryption witch messes up there account, and sometimes I need to get on there account to check stuff.

Any help appreciated.

Also does anybody know how to integrate the server accounts with mySQL? (I&#39;m pretty good with mySQL just never used it with Java)</description>
