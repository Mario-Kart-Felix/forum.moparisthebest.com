<p>The client has NOTHING to do with ‘runescript’ what they may or may not use on the server side we can’t know.  But the client is written in Java.</p>

<p>The client is written in java, and as of the upgrade to the RuneTek 5 game-engine, graphics are 100% OpenGl now, RuneTek 4 (508-554 <span class="bbcode-b">HD</span>) was also in openGl, however if i recall the ld version (RuneTek 3) was not and ran on a similar engine to RuneTek 2 (beta-502? or so) with some basic modifications.</p>
<p>Most likely server sided, most people presume that it is written in C, however some speculate it might be written is another language.</p>
<p>Runescape is based off a real shitty Mud called DeviousMud or so in 1999-ish that later became the runescape we know today after a new engine was added to make it runescape classic.</p>
