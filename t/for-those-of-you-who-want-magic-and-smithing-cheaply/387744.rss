    <description>Hi guys, I have been playing around with prices in runescape for a little and I found a good way to get smithing xp and magic xp pretty dang cheep. At max it would cost 26m to get 99 in both with this method but if you do it the long way it would probably make you money, and heres the kick, free players can do it too! Alot of you know the spell &quot;Super heat&quot; in RuneScape but never really think twice about it because you can smith in a furence without wasting a nature rune, am I right? Well I found out that if you buy all the supply&#39;s at market for mirthril ore you can make a mith bar only losing about 6 coins, I checked the ge and it has been like this for about 5 months so it probably wont change anytime soon. Also you make profit or at least break even doing steal bars, it gives about 38k xp in mage and hour and 23k xp in smithing an hour. Pretty damn good for two of the high priced skill I would say. Also helps you make your pkers without having an insane level of hp. Goodluck with the Nerding out guys :p</description>
