    <title>Localhost problem with client... NEED HELP</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/localhost-problem-with-client-need-help/326629</link>
    <description>I seriously need help.


Well, I&#39;ve finnaly found the server I thought I could do something with... But, as I got about half way through of my coding goal, I found out the client doesn&#39;t work. The client only works for me, and won&#39;t connect for anybody else. I guess its set to localhost and theres some big fix for it. YES I&#39;ve changed the GUI IP&#39;s, I&#39;ve done everything but still it only connects to localhost.

heres it the original server thread; http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,397390.msg2950299.html#msg2950299
