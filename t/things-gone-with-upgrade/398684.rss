That then unbalances it for people that want to raid<br>
[/quote]What about if only people who wanted to raid could be raided?<br>
[/quote]That’s what I was thinking. You choose (maybe you can change once per week, or whatever) to be peaceful or not. If you’re not, you can pvp/raid/steal, but if you are, you can’t pvp/raid/steal</p>
<p>But I don’t see how we would do that[/quote]Good idea to me!</p>

No, because what if someone griefs the shit out of your house, goes into your good chest, and burns the items, then gets banned? Now you have nothing. This server can’t be trusted.<br>
Also, pistons will be in 1.7, which will add a whole new dimension of traps and chest hiding.</p>
