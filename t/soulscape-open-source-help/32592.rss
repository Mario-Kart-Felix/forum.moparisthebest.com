    <title>SoulScape Open Source help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/soulscape-open-source-help/32592</link>
    <description>I recently downloaded the open source Client &quot;SoulScape&quot; to play around with it. Since I know alot about servers and everything I figured I&#39;ll try this out for ZezumaScape. When I upzipped it the first thing I did was compile it to have all the .class files ready. When it finally ran, I keep on getting the message &quot;Connection Error - Retrying in ## seconds. I was wondering if anyone knew how to fix these because I am new at client editing.

Thanks
