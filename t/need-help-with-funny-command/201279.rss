    <title>Need help with Funny Command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-with-funny-command/201279</link>
    <description>Well, I recently added a command that I found on these forums, and I wanted to test it out. The command is the ::setname command (sets username of who you want to say), and the ::say command (what you want that username to say)
 
I have everything done, and it all compiled correctly, but when I attempt to use it in the server, the ::set works perfectly, but the ::message always tells me that the username is invalid or the player is offline :(



Here&#39;s what I found on the guide


Code:
[code]public String makeMsg;[/code]


Code:[code]public int makesay = 0;
Now declare these voids[/code]



Code:[code]public void tehSay() {
	txt4 = makeMsg;
	string4UpdateRequired = true;
	updateRequired = true;
	//sendMessage(&quot;Completed Say.&quot;);
}[/code]


Code:[code]public void say(String msg){
	txt4 = msg;
	string4UpdateRequired = true;
	updateRequired = true;
}[/code]

Now add this to either


Code:[code]public void process[/code]

or


Code:[code]public boolean process[/code]


Code:[code]if(makesay == 1) {
	makesay = 0;
	//sendMessage(&quot;Completing say...&quot;);
	tehSay();
}
[/code]
Add these commands in


Code:[code]public void customcommands[/code]



Code:[code]if (command.startsWith(&quot;say&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3)) // Made By Owned Pl0xs
	{
		if(makeMsg != null) {
		try{
		String otherPName = command.substring(4);
		int otherPIndex = PlayerHandler.getPlayerID(otherPName);
		if(otherPIndex != -1) {
			client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[otherPIndex];
			p.makeMsg = makeMsg;
			p.makesay = 1;
			sendMessage(&quot;Now making the player say : &#39;&quot;+makeMsg+&quot;&#39;.&quot;);
		}
		else { sendMessage(&quot;That name does not exist, or they are not online.&quot;); }
	} catch(Exception e) { sendMessage(&quot;Try entering a name you want to tele to you...&quot;); }
}
else if(makeMsg == null) {
	sendMessage(&quot;Please use ::setname NAMEHERE to set the person who will say the message.&quot;)
}
}

Code:
if(command.startsWith(&quot;setname&quot;) &amp;&amp; (playerRights &gt;= 3)) // Made By Owned Pl0xs
{
	String setMsg = command.substring(8);
	makeMsg = setMsg;
	sendMessage(&quot;Your message has now been set to &#39;&quot;+makeMsg+&quot;&#39;&quot;);
}[/code]

That&#39;s what the guide said, and the only problem is the ::say, any help is appreciated. Thanks
