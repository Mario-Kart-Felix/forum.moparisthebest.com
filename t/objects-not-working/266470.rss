    <description>Hello, 

   For some reason when I mine, there is a &quot;rocks&quot; (id=2095) and one that is already programmed into my server works, for example I can mine on it. But I spawn another rock or use other rocks say somewhere else on the map they dont work even thought their id=2095. Shouldn&#39;t the mineing work for all of the rocks no matter where, or does the area they are placed in have an effect. THe same is happening for my woodcutting.</description>
