    <title>Command to give Membership</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/command-to-give-membership/220356</link>
    <description>I Cant figure out how to add a command to give membership that actually works... Going into the character file and setting 

playerIsMember = 1;

doesn&#39;t give membership for some reason... I haven&#39;t even tried to make a server since the membership code has been added... so any help is greatly appreciated.</description>
