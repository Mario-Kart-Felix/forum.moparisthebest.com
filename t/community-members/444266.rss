    <description>No idea if this has been raised before, but there aren&#39;t that many community members that there should be. I believe that there are many outstanding members of the community who help out and are respected but the current role of becoming a Community Member by being voted by others is highly unlikely. I think that there are people that are helping out that don&#39;t get noticed and therefore don&#39;t get nominated.</description>

The Vet rank was hidden because of the way people were viewing it. It was being treated as a pedestal, which wasn’t the intent we originally had for the section.<br>
Now being a Vet means that you get access to a single hidden discussion forum, and this forum is largely dominated by software development discussion. There’s also the voting section.<br>
Admittedly the section is a little devoid of life, but I think the general lack of talent is more to blame for that than anything else.</p>
<p>Anyway, removing the visible ‘awards’ that people received as Vets (i.e., the rank title under their username and the yellow username in the online users section) allowed a shift in voting. Vets who previously saw the rank as something that should only be given to people who make good role models (due to them standing out so much) could finally vote for new veterans based on their skill instead. The result is that the section is now about programming skill more than anything else.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Well I feel as though there’s another flaw to that idea. All moderators are generically given the rank without actually earning it. If it’s based on programming, many of the mods shouldn’t be apart of it. I originally thought it was supposed to be a MoparScape CM rank. Ie, just rank of elite status on the forum.[/quote]<br>
[me=Lothy]shrugs[/me]</p>
<p>It was devised a few years ago. Moparisthebest basically came onto IRC and got Silab and I to join a private channel. It was there that the idea was finalised, and it was Silab and I who gave Mopar the list of users who we thought were worth having in such a section. The users on that list were chosen because of their prowess.</p>
<p>Somehow the focus changed along the way (mostly because it wasn’t just Silab and I that were effectively ‘voting’ people in like we did on that first day). I guess you could say that, eventually, the ‘role model’ mindset dominated in the polls, and people with merit programming-wise were knocked back because of attitude problems.</p>
<p>Moderators receiving the rank was more about allowing them to stand out. Global moderators on MITB largely wanted nothing to do with this website, and so it was an easy way to make the moparscape moderators stand out as well. I think this is one of the main reasons for the loss of focus that occurred.</p>

              <p>We need a new rank for members to look up to. Adding a new rank to promote people to so they can be recognized for helping the community or doing something new is a good idea.

The forums right now is basically a bunch of fish swimming around in sewer water.</p>

Like on MITB, the programming section, a person wouldn’t be suited for moderating that section if they don’t have much background in the topic. Just the same as server helpers are given the rank for, well helping out in the server help section. The same with tutorial authors.</p>

On the other hand there is a voting process for Moparscape vet, you have to be nominated and voted in with a large majority agreeing to you being a vet (ratio of 2:1).</p>
<p>The Moparscape vet rank is currently hidden (So, the yellow name and rank name doesn’t display anymore). We have other ways to award those who are always doing positive things for the community, for example the server helper award for those who consistently help people with their servers on the forums.</p>
<p>Vets are usually voted in because they’ve displayed a good understanding of something (usually a programming language, or multiple), and have utilized their understanding on the community by releasing things and helping others.</p>

              <p>No idea if this has been raised before, but there aren’t that many community members that there should be.
