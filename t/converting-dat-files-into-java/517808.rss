    <title>Converting .DAT files into .JAVA</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/converting-dat-files-into-java/517808</link>
    <description>All my character files in my source have .DAT extension to them and when I try to read or edit them it all looked to be in weird symbols and stuff that I asked about in a previous thread cause I was being dumb and assuming it was a font problem instead of looking it up.

Now I found out it looked that way (which to me is unreadable so I cannot change until I fix) because of it .DAT file like my test account im using on this is TR Test so when I try and find characters file in source it says TR Test and when I hold mouse over it the file type is DAT file and I need to figure out how to convert it to a JAVA file so I can read and edit it.

some one please help. thanks</description>
