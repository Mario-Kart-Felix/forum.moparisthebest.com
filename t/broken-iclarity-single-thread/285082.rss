    <description>This is really just a slightly updated version by me.

My Stuff:

[CODE]-Server is now Single-Threaded
-Fully stops SYI, only 3 ips per connection (can change it if you want)[/CODE]

This could actually make it a somewhat stable czar server.

Why is it broken? You cant fully login. It goes to the gameframe but then times out It still needs some fixing. Syi is stopped still however, i tested it. 

Link: [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?2jzzymxy41h]http://www.mediafire.com/?2jzzymxy41h[/url]

Dont flame, its just an idea to maybe have a server that isnt delta that people can easily use and edit.





Prima&#39;s Stuff:


[CODE]Server is packaged and very easy to edit.
All classes are easy to access and find.
All files such as data files and config files are neatly tidied into separate folders in the &#39;bin&#39; folder.
Perfect PvP and NvP combat.
Perfect following and combat following, working with range, melee, magic AND autocasting.
Fully working autocasting on players.
Perfect 1v1 areas with PvP combat.
Perfect attack and defence bonuses for melee, range and magic.
FULL PvP magic.
No NvP magic added yet.
Almost finished Barrows.
56 waves of the Tzhaar Fight cave.
Fully working headicons - loaded through the cache; not hardcoded.
Fully working Hint icon, which is used in dueling and NPC&#39;s who attack you such as the barrows brothers.
Almost finished dueling. Still some rules to finish off. Full staking, and most rules work.
Fully working wilderness levels; no shit PvP levels.
Projectiles follow you, or your projectiles follow the enemy - This works with both NPCs and Players.
Most special attacks added.
Perfect second hit mask - No timers for double hitting special attacks.
Perfect timers for magic. E.G. blitz has the delay between the GFX and the actual hit.
Some skills started on. These include cooking, thieving, fishing and herblore.[/CODE]</description>

Sorry, i need to correct you on this. The cache and items for client-sided things is all we leeched from jagex. If we leeched the server then why do we not have servers just like those? explain me that. We made the servers from scrath (well the 1st rsps people did) and we just leeched the client from runescape</p>

<p>This source is for people to maybe stop using delta, but get into a slightly older source that can be stabler.</p>

              <p>This is really just a slightly updated version by me.</p>
<p>My Stuff:</p>
<p><code>-Server is now Single-Threaded
-Fully stops SYI, only 3 ips per connection (can change it if you want)</code></p>
<p>This could actually make it a somewhat stable czar server.</p>
<p>Why is it broken? You cant fully login. It goes to the gameframe but then times out It still needs some fixing. Syi is stopped still however, i tested it.</p>

<p>Dont flame, its just an idea to maybe have a server that isnt delta that people can easily use and edit.</p>
<p>Prima’s Stuff:</p>
<p><code>Server is packaged and very easy to edit.
All classes are easy to access and find.
All files such as data files and config files are neatly tidied into separate folders in the 'bin' folder.
Perfect PvP and NvP combat.
Perfect following and combat following, working with range, melee, magic AND autocasting.
Fully working autocasting on players.
Perfect 1v1 areas with PvP combat.
Perfect attack and defence bonuses for melee, range and magic.
FULL PvP magic.
No NvP magic added yet.
Almost finished Barrows.
56 waves of the Tzhaar Fight cave.
Fully working headicons - loaded through the cache; not hardcoded.
Fully working Hint icon, which is used in dueling and NPC's who attack you such as the barrows brothers.
Almost finished dueling. Still some rules to finish off. Full staking, and most rules work.
Fully working wilderness levels; no shit PvP levels.
Projectiles follow you, or your projectiles follow the enemy - This works with both NPCs and Players.
Most special attacks added.
Perfect second hit mask - No timers for double hitting special attacks.
Perfect timers for magic. E.G. blitz has the delay between the GFX and the actual hit.
Some skills started on. These include cooking, thieving, fishing and herblore.</code></p>
