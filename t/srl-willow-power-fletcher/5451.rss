What This does: Chops willows until the inventory is full, then it uses the knife on the log and starts making them into whatever the user chose, ( long / short ). Repeats this process.

When it was made: Before villavu.com has been gone.

Is it being updated?: No updates at the moment. Post bugs / fixes if any.

Disclaimer: I am not responsible for any of my scripts doing any harm to your characters offence status. This includes rule number 7 in runescape ( of course ). If you are banned or runescape has detected the use of this macro, Please post about this.

Extra Notes: This script only supports one player at the moment.

RULES: Please do not abuse this macro, play legit every 2 hours if possible. 

WARNING!: DO NOT RUN FOR MORE THAN 4 HOURS OR YOU ARE BANNED FOR SURE.
