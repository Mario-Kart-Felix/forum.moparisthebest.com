If there&#39;s one thing I have found endlessly fascinating, it really is cosmetic surgery. Those &#39;before&#39; photos taken with disfiguring apparel and no lights or make-up. The &#39;after&#39; pictures snapped in a professional business with the benefit of all that Hollywood has to offer. Which amongst us has never looked at those photos and dreamt of some sort of where we all appear to be Meg Ryan? With this brave new world, you guys have it over people in spades. Many of us bow down to your own greater experience and they are filled with wonder and amazement at precisely what you&#39;ll come up with up coming. For now, at least, my appetite has been satiated by simply news that the ideal &#39;toe cleavage&#39; is a mere medical procedure or two away. If my footwear don&#39;t fit any longer, I won&#39;t need to difficulty myself with a time consuming shopping trip to replace these people -- I can simply have any toe shortened, a new bunion surgically removed or both my toes remodelled. Not for me the least concern of long term numbness, the inability to wander properly ever again or perhaps a life filled with constant debilitating pain. And not a single normal length toe on my typical feet curled at the idea of spending Two thousand 500 money per digit to be able to submit to the chef&#39;s knife. To be honest, I&#39;d by no means really noticed my personal toe-cleavage before now and I&#39;d always, rather naively it seems like, just bought sneakers that fitted and left the other sort on the shelves. What kind of woman does that make me personally, eh? Just a believed – and I don&#39;t want to be described as a killjoy here - yet has anyone considered asking shoe designers if they could find a means of producing their art pieces in larger styles? If they refuse we&#39;re able to contemplate an impassioned demonstrate march. Oh, I forgot -- we can&#39;t, could we – now our toes are too short along with our soles thus stuffed with collagen which standing unaided is unthinkable. Never mind, I&#39;m sure it will not be long before surgeons have the option of permanently attaching walking sticks for the palms of our hands – beautifully of course!
