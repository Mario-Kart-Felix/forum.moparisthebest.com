    <title>[PI] I want it to notify the person that they are unmuted. HELP!</title>

    <description>I want it so that when I unmute someone they get the message saying c2.sendMessage(&quot;You have been unmuted by &quot; + c.playerName);.



I added the of Client 2 and the for loop and stuff but I get some errors, any smart people out there know the correct way of doing this I&#39;d appreciate it.

This is the already made unmute command I have:
[code]			if (playerCommand.startsWith(&quot;unmute&quot;)) {
				try {	
					String playerToBan = playerCommand.substring(7);
					Connection.unMuteUser(playerToBan);
				} catch(Exception e) {
					c.sendMessage(&quot;Player Must Be Offline.&quot;);

				}			
			}[/code]



Thanks. :)</description>
