    <description>Hi guys

I used to play on some priv servers over a year ago and it was fine, but I have just tried to get on them again and it is not working out
I can connct ok, and play for 1 to a few minutes fine, but then it freezes and does nothing... this is with mopar and silab

I was using an older computer a few days ago with that problem, and we have now got a new computer and it is doing the same thing

Specs of new computer:
AMD Athlon 64 x 2 dual core 5200+
3GIG ram
NVIDIA GEFORCE 8400gs 3d
Visa home premium OS

How can this be freezing?

Any help would be much appeciated as I really would like to play or maybe create a server!

Thanks</description>
