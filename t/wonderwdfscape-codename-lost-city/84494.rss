[b]Introduction: [/b]WonderWDFscapE used to be my old (old) Private runescape sever, when i first joined here at Moparscape, Then I gave up on my sever, the reason was: Im plain ol&#39; lazy. some people might remember this awesome sever (/over-exaduration) Some of you may not.

[b]Why did you make this thread:[/b] Im proud to announce, The Re-Opening of WonderWDFscapE! Codenamed Lost City. (Because WonderWDFscapE was lost for some time :P)

[b]So...?[/b] Anyone wanna help me remake this awesome sever?

[b]Yep![/b] Okays then, Basically i want the sever not to look like everyone elses,, I Want it set in a sort of really textured city in RuneScape (For example, Tzhar, or the Lost City place :P)

So if anyone could help. Please do.

The sever is planned to be released in 3 days from now. [br][size=1]Posted on: April 25, 2007, 09:21:11 AM[/size][hr]BYW, im not active on Moparscape, But i might become. Also just so you know, Ma name is Wonderguy6.</description>
