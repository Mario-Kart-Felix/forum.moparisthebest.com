Welcome to The WowScape Development Team Thread, Firstly i will give you a background of the server, then i will supply some features and then end with the the Positions needed and the Application form.

[b]Background;[/b] I first thought of the idea when i created my first server website, i thought to myself, Why don&#39;t i combine 2 things i enjoy and make 1 thing that everyone will enjoy. Now i am confident with my HTML, CSS and PHP knowledge i am going to combine it all with Java and make a server with it all, I am in the process of making a website like [url=http://www.jagex.com]Jagex[/url] to use as they do, recruiting staff, advertising the game and other things we do.

              <p>That’s a good attempt for a pseudo-professional server.  If you would like to establish a real organization of a server, purchase a domain.  Secondly, how are your Bumper organization and Wowscape server copyrights?  You need to register for copyright trademarks.  Otherwise, I love the design of the site, and good luck with this project.</p>
