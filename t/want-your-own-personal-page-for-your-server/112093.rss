    <title>Want your own personal page for your server?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/want-your-own-personal-page-for-your-server/112093</link>
    <description>Hi.

I know people like to advertise their server so I decided to make use of my website that I [b]never[/b] use.  I&#39;m offering you a chance to have your own page for your server with as much as info as you&#39;d like.  It would be like [i]www.kitnopodcast.com/servername[/i].  I used to do a podcast that I quit now.  So now I have that domain with over 2gb of bandwidth.  I&#39;m giving back to the community by offering you this.

If you&#39;re interested please reply back with your MSN and I&#39;ll add you.  You [b]must[/b] write out the code for your page (html) in a notepad and then send it to me.  I&#39;m not writing your pages for you. Also, I can host webclients for you too.

[b]THIS IS ALL FREE[/b].
