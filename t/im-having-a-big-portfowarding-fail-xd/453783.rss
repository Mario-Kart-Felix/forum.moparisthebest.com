    <title>Im having a BIG portfowarding FAIL XD</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/im-having-a-big-portfowarding-fail-xd/453783</link>
    <description>Okay, so I use to run a decent server, generated a few donations everyday. But know that I have switched from a cisco to a 2wire 2701hg-b, I CANT HOST MY SERVER.  I have portfowarded and everything.( it says both of my ports are open) I tried to set up a ip with no-ip, and it says error connecting. I went to a status checker page, use my normal IP and it said it was online. I tried to go on my server through the client which I have made some edits in. So yes I know my ip is entered correctly and I did compile it. So when I go to sign in, it says error connecting to server. even when the status checker said online. Please Help!

IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT IM SAYING, SORRY I DID THIS REALLY FAST.</description>
