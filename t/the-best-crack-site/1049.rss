    <title>The best crack site?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-best-crack-site/1049</link>
    <description>edit* If your too lazy to read all that, I am basically asking for the best crack site around, one that I can be sure has no malicious codes in the site, the .wmf exploit keeps haunting me. 

Im fed up with hackers.

I&#39;ve re-formatted my computer twice in the last month because of some dumb f***&#39;s in brazil. Microsoft is pretty bad I thought they had as cure for the wmf exploit, but it certainly hasn&#39;t done anything.

Long time ago, I&#39;d go to crackspider, or mscracks. Both are now filled with script exploits. If you go to mscracks it downloads files onto your computer. Luckily they are eaier to remove but they are very annoying. Crackspider linked me to another site which had the wmf exploit. The ONE time I use internet explorer, my computer gets screwed over. It downloaded spyaxe and spy sherrif, I was getting a popup every second, and eventually I could only boot up in safe mode. They created hidden files that couldnt be deleted, speical guides and removal programs for CW and smitfraud(Has many variants) didn&#39;t work at all. I had to re format my computer. So now I was getting my programs back, still didn&#39;t get firefox yet I was just downloading other programs first. Such as 3ds max 7(8 doesnt work for me), so I downloaded the trial and went to another site off of google. This one also screwed up my computer a few nights ago, and I had to re format again, out of all the coolwebsearch viruses, this one was undelete-able and drove me nuts. It was sending information to the hacker markets in brazil(I ran netstat). I need a crack site that I can rely on. I never ever download cracks, I just get serial numbers, but website codes are getting very malicius these days. I have been using serials.ws however it is missing the authorization number for 3ds max 7, only has a serial. And may I suggest that if you use IE, stay away from any crack site you don&#39;t know, the .wmf exploit is not fun. So yeah, which sites do you get cracks or serial numbers from? I am fed up with &quot;hackers.&quot;

              <p>edit* If your too lazy to read all that, I am basically asking for the best crack site around, one that I can be sure has no malicious codes in the site, the .wmf exploit keeps haunting me. </p>

<p>Im fed up with hackers.</p>

<p>I've re-formatted my computer twice in the last month because of some dumb f***'s in brazil. Microsoft is pretty bad I thought they had as cure for the wmf exploit, but it certainly hasn't done anything.</p>

<p>Long time ago, I'd go to crackspider, or mscracks. Both are now filled with script exploits. If you go to mscracks it downloads files onto your computer. Luckily they are eaier to remove but they are very annoying. Crackspider linked me to another site which had the wmf exploit. The ONE time I use internet explorer, my computer gets screwed over. It downloaded spyaxe and spy sherrif, I was getting a popup every second, and eventually I could only boot up in safe mode. They created hidden files that couldnt be deleted, speical guides and removal programs for CW and smitfraud(Has many variants) didn't work at all. I had to re format my computer. So now I was getting my programs back, still didn't get firefox yet I was just downloading other programs first. Such as 3ds max 7(8 doesnt work for me), so I downloaded the trial and went to another site off of google. This one also screwed up my computer a few nights ago, and I had to re format again, out of all the coolwebsearch viruses, this one was undelete-able and drove me nuts. It was sending information to the hacker markets in brazil(I ran netstat). I need a crack site that I can rely on. I never ever download cracks, I just get serial numbers, but website codes are getting very malicius these days. I have been using serials.ws however it is missing the authorization number for 3ds max 7, only has a serial. And may I suggest that if you use IE, stay away from any crack site you don't know, the .wmf exploit is not fun. So yeah, which sites do you get cracks or serial numbers from? I am fed up with "hackers."</p>
