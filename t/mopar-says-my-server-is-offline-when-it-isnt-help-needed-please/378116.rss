    <description>Hello everyone; I just finished doing some minor coding to my server it&#39;s got a no-ip now and I was hoping to put it online so I went to the Mopar Server page and went to register my server but Moparscape says it&#39;s offline when it&#39;s not (I was online my server when I tried it) and I thought there was a problem with ip that I did with No-ip and there wasn&#39;t cause I even tried doing Run - cmd - ipconfig
but it says it&#39;s not reconized? 
I&#39;m using a D-Link Routor. Please Help!</description>
