    <description>Flobots - Handlebars


I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars
No handlebars

I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars
No handlebars

Look at me, look at me
hands in the air like it&#39;s good to be
ALIVE
and I&#39;m a famous rapper
even when the paths&#39;re all crookedy
I can show you how to do-si-do
I can show you how to scratch a record
I can take apart the remote control
And I can almost put it back together
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to &quot;De Colores&quot;
And &quot;I&#39;m Proud to be an American&quot;
Me and my friend saw a platypus
Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took
I can do anything that I want cuz, look:

I can keep rhythm with no metronome
No metronome
No metronome

I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone
On the telephone

Look at me
Look at me
Just called to say that it&#39;s good to be
ALIVE
In such a small world
All curled up with a book to read
I can make money open up a thrift store
I can make a living off a magazine
I can design an engine sixty four
Miles to a gallon of gasoline
I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions
I know how to run a business
And I can make you wanna buy a product
Movers shakers and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the systems
I can do anything with no assistance
I can lead a nation with a microphone
With a microphone
With a microphone
I can split the atoms of a molecule
Of a molecule
Of a molecule

Look at me
Look at me
Driving and I won&#39;t stop
And it feels so good to be
Alive and on top
My reach is global
My tower secure
My cause is noble
My power is pure
I can hand out a million vaccinations
Or let&#39;em all die in exasperation
Have&#39;em all healed of their lacerations
Have&#39;em all killed by assassination
I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don&#39;t like&#39;em and
I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command
I can guide a missile by satellite
By satellite
By satellite
and I can hit a target through a telescope
Through a telescope
Through a telescope
and I can end the planet in a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust
In a holocaust

I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handle bars
No handlebars

I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars
No handlebars</description>

<p>Well it’s poetry so it means love, to me, first of all. The lyrics do evoke a sense of power throughout kind of in relation to the United States in a semi-sarcastic way, painful stuff and hard to describe, I really like the video. My favorite line is about the Platypus, it makes so much fucking sense. This song makes me think about feeling good about being alive and how that feeling can turn into a love of power and that can turn into unrighteous pride which leads to crime. But mostly just about feeling good about being alive skateboarding and riding my bike with no  handlebars.</p>

<p>I like how I can take apart a remote then I can almost put it back together. Pretty sweet.</p>

The blonde hair guy lists what hes done and will do. He gains alot of power and owns the goverment and takes over the people. The people rebel and the goverment shoots his old friend. He becomes sad.</p>
<p>It shows how the world works. How the goverment wants power, how people are ordinary, how too much power is deadly. What paths and lifestyle you choose will lead you through your life and make your personality.</p>
<p>Thats what I think.</p>

              <p>A lot of people understand this song to have a different meaning, that’s what makes it so great. My personal meaning on it is that a person can do anything they want to if they just put their mind to it (which can be both a bad and a good thing according to the song). Anyway, great song &lt;3.</p>

<p>I can ride my bike with no handlebars<br>
No handlebars<br>
No handlebars</p>
<p>Look at me, look at me<br>
hands in the air like it’s good to be<br>
ALIVE<br>
and I’m a famous rapper<br>
even when the paths’re all crookedy<br>
I can show you how to do-si-do<br>
I can show you how to scratch a record<br>
I can take apart the remote control<br>
And I can almost put it back together<br>
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem<br>
I can tell you about Leif Ericson<br>
I know all the words to “De Colores”<br>
And “I’m Proud to be an American”<br>
Me and my friend saw a platypus<br>
Me and my friend made a comic book<br>
And guess how long it took<br>
I can do anything that I want cuz, look:</p>
<p>I can keep rhythm with no metronome<br>
No metronome<br>
No metronome</p>
<p>I can see your face on the telephone<br>
On the telephone<br>
On the telephone</p>
<p>Look at me<br>
Look at me<br>
Just called to say that it’s good to be<br>
ALIVE<br>
In such a small world<br>
All curled up with a book to read<br>
I can make money open up a thrift store<br>
I can make a living off a magazine<br>
I can design an engine sixty four<br>
Miles to a gallon of gasoline<br>
I can make new antibiotics<br>
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions<br>
I know how to run a business<br>
And I can make you wanna buy a product<br>
Movers shakers and producers<br>
Me and my friends understand the future<br>
I see the strings that control the systems<br>
I can do anything with no assistance<br>
I can lead a nation with a microphone<br>
With a microphone<br>
With a microphone<br>
I can split the atoms of a molecule<br>
Of a molecule<br>
Of a molecule</p>
<p>Look at me<br>
Look at me<br>
Driving and I won’t stop<br>
And it feels so good to be<br>
Alive and on top<br>
My reach is global<br>
My tower secure<br>
My cause is noble<br>
My power is pure<br>
I can hand out a million vaccinations<br>
Or let’em all die in exasperation<br>
Have’em all healed of their lacerations<br>
Have’em all killed by assassination<br>
I can make anybody go to prison<br>
Just because I don’t like’em and<br>
I can do anything with no permission<br>
I have it all under my command<br>
I can guide a missile by satellite<br>
By satellite<br>
By satellite<br>
and I can hit a target through a telescope<br>
Through a telescope<br>
Through a telescope<br>
and I can end the planet in a holocaust<br>
In a holocaust<br>
In a holocaust<br>
In a holocaust<br>
In a holocaust<br>
In a holocaust</p>
<p>I can ride my bike with no handlebars<br>
No handle bars<br>
No handlebars</p>
<p>I can ride my bike with no handlebars<br>
No handlebars<br>
No handlebars</p>
