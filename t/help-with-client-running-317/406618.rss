    <title>Help with client running 317</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-client-running-317/406618</link>
    <description>I&#39;m using a 317 server. In the character files there is a donator = 0.

If I switch it to = 1 log in, it will not show that I am a donator. Then I log out, open my character file back up and it says donator = 0. 

[b]Wtf?[/b]

If someone [b]can&#39;t help me with fixing that[/b] then I would like to make:

Character rights = 1 -Donator
Character rights = 2 -Moderator
Character rights = 3 -Admin
Character rights = 4 -Co-owner/Owner.

If I do that then I will need to change the crowns...[b]also something I have no idea how to do..[/b].

Please help.
[u]I would like to just make the donator = 1 work so I don&#39;t have to do all this extra $#!t. lol.[/u]

Help is greatly appreciated and will rep ++ ( If I could :/)

Thanks,
Jason</description>
