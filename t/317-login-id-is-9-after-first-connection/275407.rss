    <title>[317]Login ID is 9 after first connection</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-login-id-is-9-after-first-connection/275407</link>
    <description>Sup guys. On my 317 project, I&#39;m trying to add multiple connections. After connecting a second time, the login type is read as 9 instead of 14, causing the server to crash and get errors. I split the server.java class into 3 classes; server, clientHandler, and loginHandler.java. They basically all do the same thing, except on a new connection, my playerHandling.newPlayerConnected method is called (I&#39;ll post code below), which handles the event on which a new player connects. Basically all it does is creates a new client, sets a new player class, and the clientHandler creates a new loginHandler.

[code]	public static void newPlayerConnected(java.net.Socket s)
	{
		for (int i = 0; i &lt; maxPlayers; i++)
		{
			if (Players[i] == null)
			{
				newPlayerSlot = i;
				i = maxPlayers + 1;
			}
		}

		userSlot = newPlayerSlot;
		newClientHandler = new clientHandler(s, newPlayerSlot);
		(new Thread(newClientHandler)).start();
	}[/code]It&#39;s all perfect on the first connection, but like I previously stated, on the second connect, the loginType returns 9.

Any reasons why?

              <p>I really don’t think there’s enough info provided to tell why it would read as 9. Mind posting the part that actually gets the login type?</p>
<p>And, also, why would you set i to maxPlayers + 1 in the loop? Wouldn’t it be more efficient to just use a break?</p>
<p>Another little nit-picky thing: Class. and sub-class, names, conventionally, are supposed to have a capital letter in all of the words that make it up; including the first one.</p>
