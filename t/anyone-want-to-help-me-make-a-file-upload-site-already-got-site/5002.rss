    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-want-to-help-me-make-a-file-upload-site-already-got-site/5002</link>
    <description>ok so ive made an upload site, you can upload files and things but it looks very boring and has no index page (the page it automatically goes to when you type in the url), so i was wondering if anyone would like to help me make it look good.

oh yea and anyone who makes it will get ftp to my site :P</description>

              <p>It sounds like you don’t need the person to know PHP, but HTML and Css and such to make it look all nice and pretty. The index page would be easy. Just make it say “please do not direct link here” or something. The rest is just playing around with colors and tables. More of a one person thing (if you get two people working on the same table, it gets kind of hectic :P). So I’m not too sure what you need help with. Care to explain a little more?</p>

<p>All upload sites can run solely on sponsors. Depending on which sponsor you get shows what you can provide eg. upload limit. This place prolly makes a nice sum from google to pay off their server.</p>

              <p>ok so ive made an upload site, you can upload files and things but it looks very boring and has no index page (the page it automatically goes to when you type in the url), so i was wondering if anyone would like to help me make it look good.</p>
<p>oh yea and anyone who makes it will get ftp to my site <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
