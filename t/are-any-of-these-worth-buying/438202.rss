    <description>I punched in a dead hard drive&#39;s serial number that I found in my room onto the Western Digital&#39;s warranty check and while WD said that I couldn&#39;t get a replacement, they offered some upgrades [b]at &quot;discount prices&quot;[/b].

Here&#39;s the video of what they offered me: [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvE3y9q78h4]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvE3y9q78h4[/url]

Any of them worth the buy/upgrade?

Also, is the 2.5 inch SATA drive an internal laptop HDD?

[b]It is worth noting that if you have a dead hard drive sitting around your house/work, it might be eligible for a free replacement.[/b]</description>
