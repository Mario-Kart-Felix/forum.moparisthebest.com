    <title>Where Is Runescape Cheating These Days?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/where-is-runescape-cheating-these-days/386630</link>
    <description>Hey moparisthebest,

I used to be involved in runescape cheating from way back in the day. I was a part of rs-resources.com under this same name. I was really young, and definitely stupid. I used to write kiddy scripts for Aryan and SCAR. Nowadays, I am studying to become an electrical engineer in second year university. I&#39;ve taken a bunch of courses on programming and I think I&#39;m a little more adept at programming. I want to just get up some practice writing code for RS cheating because I remember that was pretty fun. I need some direction as to where I should look. Where is runescape cheating these days? Is there anything like Aryan anymore where I can code in JAVA? Is SCAR my best option? I have minimal knowledge of runescape in general and played a good 3-5 years ago now. 

Anyways, throw me a bone so I can start coding.

Thanks,

Derek</description>

Simba works great - I’ve had 10hour pure color progress reports. Color can solve 95% of randoms now too.<br>
And if that wasn’t enough, it can also use reflection to grab client data.<br>
Also, there’s a bot called cherokee being worked on[/mopar]</p>

<p>RS Cheating consits of two things now. First, 20$ Scripts and Second, Scripts that work but steal your password.</p>
<p>Also, inb4 mopar tries to sell you the deal with simba or cherokee, as they don’t seem to be going anywhere fast.</p>
