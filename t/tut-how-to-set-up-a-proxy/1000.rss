    <description>Hi,

This is the first tutorial i have submited to the community but i hope that some people out there find it usefull, Masking your IP is a usefull Ability that will stop you getting your IP banned.

Please reply with coments on this tutorial and if it was any help :)

[TUT] How to set up a proxy using IE
by Blackhat

Now were to start, ok.. lets start at the first step.

Step (one)
Find a anonymous proxy server.

There are millions of proxy&#39;s to choose from but we are looking for a anonymous proxy or High anonymous.
I belive a transparent proxy will not mask your ip.

It may take a few attempts to find a working proxy because most block Runescape and do wierd things with google, but keep trying untill you find one that works with runescape, but for now just pick one from this list and go onto step two.
(http://www.proxy4free.com/page1.html)

Step (two)

Open IE (internet explorer) and click on &quot;tools/internet options&quot; then click the &quot;connections&quot; Tab. 
If you are using dial up click on &quot;settings&quot; if you are using broadband click on &quot;LAN settings&quot;
Now check the &quot;proxy server&quot; radio button to display 2 new fields one is address and the other is port.
Enter the ip address you got from step one and the port and click o.k/apply/ok.

Step (three)

Close IE and reopen it now go to google and see what language it is in or try runescape. You will soon know it is working! (alert: Runescape will auto pick wierd worlds based on the country of the proxy computer u are using).

Hope this helps,
Now if you get banned, u will only lose one account :)

Kind Regards,
