              <p>Combat is awful? I highly disagree. Of the many server’s I’ve played, there are no distinguishable ‘OP’ items, although there are items granting benefits for donators, although it’s still easily possible to kill people with these types of items. I myself played the server for over 6 months before purchasing donator, haha.</p>
<p>OT: Bumping for everyone to come check it out! Had 125 players online the other day, it’s quite the fun! Login, spawn items, and pk to your hearts’ content!</p>

              <p>Could you please link me to them? The only one I could find said that it hasn’t been posted on in 120+ days, so I thought it’d be gravedigging if I bumped it. The topic I’ll link you to below is outdated, which may be misleading to newcomers, therefore I have posted a new one.</p>
<p>See here: <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,555250.msg4065276.html#msg4065276" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,555250.msg4065276.html#msg4065276</a><br>
This is why I’ve created a new topic:<br>
<img src="http://img818.imageshack.us/img818/5445/aa749a7c60854e37b5d4fa4.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>Also, if you search the word “Roat”, that’s the only advertisement topic that comes up. I think I know what I was doing when I posted this. Also, I did use SOME of the same pictures, because other content was removed, therefore I had to change it. I do not want new players joining with misleading information.</p>
<p>Appreciate the comments &amp; concerns though.</p>
