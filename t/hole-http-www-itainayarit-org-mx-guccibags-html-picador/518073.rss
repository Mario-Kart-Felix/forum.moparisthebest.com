Armed guards have moved up their watch at the U.S. Embassy inside Malaysia, reports CBS Media Correspondent Sharyl Attkisson . Five various other embassies have all but shut -- at least temporarily. Still more, including the embassy in Egypt, have cut back, as well as moved their surgical procedures.The heightened protection comes as the Ough.S. issued the blunt warning regarding threats to American interests in The red sea, Malaysia and Yemen, including possible &quot;attacks on buildings.&quot;&quot;Ambassadors, commanders around the globe are assessing his or her security measures in light of last Friday&#39;s attacks and taking appropriate security methods,&quot; said nationwide security spokesman G.J. Crowley. Top countrywide security advisers briefed Us president Clinton at the White Home Wednesday. They don&#39;t consider any of the arrests made so far are significant. However, 70 a lot more FBI agents tend to be headed to Eastern Africa to join your research.Officials are also re-examining the suicide bombing of the Egypt embassy in Pakistan three years in the past, saying it holds some similarities.But the unsolved truck blast attack on a US facility in Saudi Arabia is what first unveiled the frightening get to of the new, more robust terrorist bombs.&quot;When any bomb that huge faces us, it means that we have to have a drawback of 1000 foot and in many cities where we have existing embassies, it&#39;s impossible to close the main streets that we&#39;re found on,&quot; said Pat O&#39;Hanlon, formerly of the Point out Department&#39;s diplomatic security support.Despite the new stability alerts, the Ough.S. emphasizes it is not &quot;closing&quot; any installations. Rather, it will ask the legislature for emergency money to rebuild the actual destroyed embassies. The president in addition has ordered the State Department to come up with a plan by the end of the week to strengthen safety.

Weekly commentary by Chief Washington Correspondent Joe Schieffer. Not many former presidents would likely travel across the country on his or her 90th birthday only to spend some time with journalists who used to cover them, but that&#39;s what exactly Gerald Ford did yesterday, and it produced a scene at the Countrywide Press Club which was all too rare. Mister. Ford said good things about the correspondents -- not many former presidents of any age would do that -- and also the reporters said great things about him, this also was not your normal hallelujah chorus. It provided everyone from Joe Woodward, whose Watergate reporting produced down Richard Nixon, on the old Newsweek reporter Ben DeFrank, Time magazine&#39;s Hugh Sidey, the famous Helen Thomas as well as Phil Jones and that additional guy from Abc. Part of it, of course, is always that Mr. Ford can be 90. But I consider there was more with it than that. You see, editors always respected Mr. Ford because he actually listened to their inquiries and tried to respond to them. He believed he or she owed that towards the reporters because he considered the American people deserved an explanation for their actions. That frame of mind is so out of trend now, it practically seems quaint. Currently PR advisers mentor their public administrators to develop two or three speaking points and then repeat them over and over and over no matter what the question, which fits fine until the news turns bad, as the current administration will be discovering. It&#39;s turning out to be a long time ago since political leaders acted like Gerry Frd, and the new age group of public authorities could learn a great deal from him, however my guess is they is not going to.

Anyone who knows me or perhaps familiar with this column probably would guess that I follow sports scores a lot more closely as compared to I do art sales. Nonetheless, one of my favorite recent news tales involved Christie&#39;s, Sotheby&#39;s, and more than $20 million worth of art. Takashi Hashiyama, chief executive of a Japanese gadgets firm, couldn&#39;t determine which auction house to use in order to unload the company&#39;s art work collection. Did they ask them to enter a bidding war? Did he split the collection between the two auction houses? Does he ask around to find out which one had the fastest-talking auctioneer? Simply no. He decided to work with a decision-making process that kids have used for generations: rock, paper, scissors.In the event that you&#39;ve been living in the cage — or a paper or even scissors — in this online game, rock breaks scissers, scissors cuts paper, and paper smothers rock and roll. What I love concerning Hashiyama&#39;s decision to use a kids method to decide the actual fate of all this specific art and money could it be was so pure, therefore fair, and so much more fun than having several MBAs making a bunch of charts based on some fancy theories.Sotheby&#39;s decided to depart its decision for you to chance, and had absolutely no particular strategy. Christie&#39;s, alternatively, turned to some professionals: the children of their intercontinental director of the impressionist along with modern art department. The 11-year-old twin daughters immediately told their particular dad to go with scissers. Their reasoning was that, &quot;Rock is way as well obvious, and pair of scissors beats paper.&quot; So, Christie&#39;s chose scissors, Sotheby&#39;s chose paper, scissers &quot;cut&quot; paper and Christie&#39;s acquired the deal.    no previous page next    1/2  [url=http://ruizmasse.com/michaelkorshandbags.html]cheap michael kors handbags[/url] 
Many observers in Buenos aires say indictments of administration officials in the trickle of the name of the former CIA operative would be the final part of an &quot;imperfect storm&quot; for President Bush, according to previous presidential adviser David Gergen.Gergen, that advised four presidents and it is now editor-at-large of Oughout.S. News along with World Report, informs The Early Show co-anchor John Smith, &quot;If indictments are passed down, it&#39;s going to be a real blow to the administration, and it comes at a dreadful time.&quot;We&#39;ve got this kind of confluence now, people are contacting it &#39;the imperfect hurricane.&#39;&quot;You&#39;ve got potential indictments soon. You&#39;ve got pressure building up among conservatives for Harriet Miers in order to withdraw (as a nominee for that Supreme Court), and you&#39;ve got the actual death toll throughout Iraq, sadly, all set over the 2,500 mark.&quot;Those coming together, I think, put the White Residence in the darkest location it&#39;s been since this president took office and to me, it&#39;s going to be an extended climb out of the hole. If he were to lose (top politics strategist) Karl Rove, he&#39;ll lose his / her right arm, and it is hard to climb from a hole without the right arm.&quot;Rove along with Vice President Dick Cheney&#39;s primary of staff, We Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, have been mentioned as is possible targets of the exploration being conducted by simply Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald.Gergen says a report Thursday in The New York Times that Libby first heard the name of Valerie Plame, the former CIA operative, coming from Cheney himself, rather than through journalists, could mean far more trouble for Libby than Cheney.    no previous page next    1/2  http://ruizmasse.com/ralphlaurenoutlet.html
