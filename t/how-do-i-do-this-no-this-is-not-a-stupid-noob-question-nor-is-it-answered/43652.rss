    <description>I have a man (ID 1024)
I need to make it if you attack him he turns into wolfman (ID 1030)
I put code in that compiled right but it didnt work  :confused: maybe i put it at wrong place...?
it was [i]something[/i] like this 
if (NPCID == 1024 &amp;&amp; server.npcHandler.npcs[npcIndex].IsUnderAttack == true) {
NPCID = 1030;
updateRequired = true;
appearenceUpdateRequired = true;
}
that might not be my accual code, (its something like it, ya know typos happen)</description>

              <p>He isn’t trying to change NPCs. He’s trying to replace an NPC loaded from autospawn.cfg into another one when it gets attacked. Of course, the autospawn works something like a while statement I’d imagine. While the NPC is on autospawn.cfg, it appears in game… So you can’t really replace it like that.</p>
