    <description>[iurl=#no]If your not here to get help, click me.[/iurl]

Ok guys, I know you don&#39;t like reading and want to get your question answered as soon as possible, but in order for us to help you, you [b]need[/b] to do a little reading! Please, at least keep reading and follow the link about to come up and read the post with the info you need, and if your still stuck, you can post.

If you need general help, look just below this sentence, or if you need more specific help, [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/board,51.0.html]please check out the tutorial section[/url].

The &quot;Perfect&quot; Compiler, original poster = Taharok
General MoparScape FAQ, original poster =Tico135
Moparscape Web Client, original poster = moparisthebest
Silabsofts client -- FAQ&#39;s -- Questions and answers [Updated 9/28/07], original poster = Frell

All you need to do is [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,195700.0.html]click this link![/url] 

[anchor=no]You may be confused, you may not. I&#39;ll try to answer questions, and whatnot so don&#39;t hesitate to ask.[/anchor]

How to post in the new stickies,
Since there are multiple stickies in 1 thread now, communicating may be a little harder, so to make it easier, please say(or copy and paste the post name) what sticky you were reading and posting about. Also, please refrain from posting &quot;thank you&quot; posts, if you want to thank the person that made the sticky, scroll to the top of the post, see who the original poster was(in the red + bold text, not the person who posted it), and pm them your thanks or rep them in another post.

What is all this about?
This was a little plan by me to reduce the amount of stickies, and it didn&#39;t turn out half bad. Minus a few annoyances, it&#39;s up and running. You should keep reading if you fall into one of the following:
[]About to post in a sticky
[]Reading a specific sticky

So, how does this new system work? There are 2 stickies, one for rules and mod notes that need to be stickied, the other for a general FAQ and information. In the first post, you will find links, all of these links send you to posts further down, all of these posts linked in the first post were once stickies, and remain so. I, and other mods thought it would be a bit more organized and people would take time to look at stickies if there are less, however there have been a few problems.

Please don&#39;t forget, this is more of a &quot;trial and error&quot; thing, we [b]need[/b] your feedback on this one, and if it doesn&#39;t work out, it will return to the way it was. If you got something to say, post it here.

If you owned a sticky before,
You&#39;ll still find it. If you need to update it, pm The Un-Named(any other mods, edit your name in if you want to help out) asking what to change. As you may have noticed, the plan didn&#39;t turn out the way I expected it so you might not have your original post, however the original poster is stated at the top of each post.</description>
