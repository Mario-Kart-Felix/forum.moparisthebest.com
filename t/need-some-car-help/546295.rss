    <title>Need some car help!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-some-car-help/546295</link>
    <description>So this guy wants to trade me a car for my laptop. It&#39;s a gaming laptop valued at $1,200.. But I only paid $150. It has a crack in the housing for the water pump, but everything else is good. I&#39;m wondering if this is a decent deal for $150, and what it would take to fix the water pump leak. Any car experts please do put in your input!

[b]The Car[/b]
[b]Make/Model/Year:[/b] 1997 Buick Regal LS
[b]Engine:[/b] 3.8L V6
[b]Condition:[/b] Good to Very Good
[b]Miles:[/b] ~170k
[b]Interior:[/b] Good Condition
[b]Exterior:[/b] Small patch of rust, and two small dents. (Which I don&#39;t mind)

[b]Pros[/b]

[ul][li]Aftermarket Radio (decent dual one)[/li]
[li]Aftermarket front and back speakers (made by Infinity)[/li]
[li]Already wired for an amplifier (I was going to put subs in anyways[/li]
[li]Has six speakers, four are after market (has tweeters, mids, and lows)[/li]
[li]New Starter[/li]
[li]New Battery[/li]
[li]New Water Pump[/li]
[li]New electronic ignition switch.[/li]
[li]I&#39;m getting it for $150[/li]
[li]Grand Touring Suspension Package[/li]
[li]Everything else is in pretty good shape.[/li]
[li]It runs and drives, just has the chance of overheating.[/li][/ul]


[b]Cons[/b]

[ul][li]The housing in the water pump needs to be replaced.[/li]
[li]I don&#39;t have a license yet, so it would cost money to register it under my dads name.[/li]
[li]I would need to find a tow truck to get it to my house, unless my dad can fix it on spot.[/li][/ul]


[b]Pictures[/b] - [i]The guy said it&#39;s so messy because his parents store stuff in there, since he got a new car.[/i]
[i]Exterior[/i]

[i]Interior[/i]
[IMG]http://i60.tinypic.com/2ng4viw.jpg[/img]

[IMG]http://i59.tinypic.com/20uet08.jpg[/img]

[b][i]So I have two main questions..[/i][/b]
[b]1)[/b] Is this worth $150? Is that a good price for me to pay for it? Would it be a decent first car?
[b]2)[/b] What would it cost to fix the housing on the water pump?

Thanks MSC!

<p>Thanks for the response, he said that it’s a leak somewhere in the water pump (or near). However, I’m going to go check it out tomorrow and I’ll get back to you. I don’t really care much for speed/power, I’m more interested in the audio.<br>

Seems an astronomically big engine for a guy who can’t drive, but meh, it’s down to you.</p>
<p>Try your best to get the pictures of the leakage because it depends on the size of the hole whether you could just plug weld it or if you’d have to wedge it first then cap over it with weld or if it’s a plastic housing etc.[/quote]</p>
<p>I’m a good driver, and I can drive. I just haven’t gotten my license. The guy said he believes it’s a crack in the housing, but he isn’t sure. I’m going to look at it today with my dad who has been a mechanic for 22 years, so I’ll let you know how it works out.</p>
