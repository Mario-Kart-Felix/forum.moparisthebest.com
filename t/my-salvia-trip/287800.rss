    <title>My salvia trip</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-salvia-trip/287800</link>
    <description>Well... I really can&#39;t explain much of it at all, as I don&#39;t remember most, but for the most part it was truly FUCKED UP. We started taking hits from the bong (after already being high on weed) and none of the 3 people that hit it felt the desired effects, including me.. so after a few socializing hits we realized we&#39;ve been trippin&#39; out the whole time.. and that&#39;s where shit gets crazy.

My one friend (Billy) starts yelling on top of everyone talking about god knows what and complaining about how he&#39;s not tripping out, when in fact his trip out is like him NOT tripping out.. and it&#39;s really scaring him at this point.

My other buddy (Quinn) is just sitting on the couch with his gf and all of the sudden, since all the commotion with Billy yelling and everything, he closes his eyes and starts seeing tribal shit. Like torches and a bonfire and us chanting... He thought we were trying to kill him. He closes his eyes while he&#39;s laying down on the couch and literally starts running while laying down.. Eventually Billy catches onto this and tries to further Quinn&#39;s trip out by &quot;pawing&quot; at his legs. At this point he starts trying to run faster and faster, and goes into his gf&#39;s arms and starts crying as he&#39;s running, and I mean bursting into tears.

Me, on the other hand is experiencing a totally different trip, more philosophical.. but stressing because of what I was thinking about and the commotion. Throughout all of this I could see MYSELF as I would another person, yet still in the same state of mind. Watching as I and other people interact, I begin to think how retarded my trip could be made out to be by the sober people if they realize how bad I&#39;m tripping (since I&#39;m not the focal point, Quinn is).. I would slur my speech, I almost attempted leaving about 4 times because I was constantly contemplating reality and why we are all here, and why we are in the body we are in. As I would try and leave I would feel my mind (since I had an out-of-body type experience, there was another one of &#39;me&#39; that no one could see or notice, the true me) would push me back down as I attempted getting up.

It was really fucked up, and an hour after that I still felt the weird effects of Salvia, contemplating every aspect of life that was going on..

edit: sry if that didn&#39;t make much sense, pretty stoned atm trying to think back on last nights events</description>
