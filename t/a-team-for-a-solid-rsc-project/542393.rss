    <title>A team for a solid RSC project</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-team-for-a-solid-rsc-project/542393</link>
    <description>Greetings everyone,

Before anyone would come with reply&#39;s  like &quot;why would anyone well educated in coding stick with you?&quot;  :palm:
I&#39;d like to give u my + and - in server development.

I&#39;m not well known in the RS(C) server branch.
I&#39;m not well educated in C++ nor Java.
I&#39;m decent in SQL/HTML/PHP.

Although,

I&#39;m great at advertising.
I&#39;m great at server management.
I&#39;m great at server investment.
I&#39;m great at team building.
I&#39;m great at Runescape Classic.
I&#39;m great at the &quot;owner&quot; role not the &quot;developer&quot; role.

With all that said, I&#39;m looking for a willing team to develop a RSC project that would focus on being a copy of the original version. 
Also new content fitting the original RSC style should be implemented, this obviously doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re implementing items/monsters that would unbalance the current 3 hit combat system.

We&#39;d probally need to make options to make reaching goals such as &quot;40 atk - 70 str - 1 def - 31 prayer&quot; quicker. 
Because plenty of people have done this over and over and over and over and over and over again.

Ideas and suggestions are obviously welcome as the community is small and hard to reach.

With all that said.

I thank u for reading and am looking forward to reply&#39;s.

^yes grammar fails everywhere.</description>

Yea too bad he moved onto bigger and better things which is why he still knows RSC like a keyboard. He still messes with it.<br>

dont doubt it at all. he just left the whole community. can’t blame him for that either…[/quote]<br>
Well…This community isn’t really worth staying so it’s understandable, I only keep checking here in case some outsider comes here and does something really cool, like zerratar did with C# version of RSC.</p>

<p>We have a solid team already working on a complete Runescape Classic server replicating the real RSC. You said you are looking to fund a project. This is why i told you to come talk with us.</p>

<p>Once you make your opinion, if you enjoy playing on our server, you can always donate when time are harder if it ever happen. Because honestly, our main goal is to run a complete server and let it open for years for all the people who wished Jagex would reopen a server.[/quote]I think you owe it to the RSC community to open-source aspects of your game, or at least the data used to build it. Competition is not an issue if your server stays up and has solid hosting (why would anybody play anything but yours if it has the most uptime and best administration?).</p>

<p>What benefits would those doing the development for you have out of the project? Would you be paying them? RSC servers are a dime a dozen and evaporate after a few weeks with zero players online. Crooks did a great job replicating RSCRevolution and RSCEmulation still has a strong following. KaramjaRSC has unique features and a good player base. How would you differentiate your server from these heavy weights? What market niche would this fit into? What are your plans for generating revenue to make the hosting sustainable? What are your disaster mitigation and recovery plans in the event of a database leak like ProjectRSC or game server flaw that floods the economy like in RSCEmulation recently?[/quote]</p>
<p>The instant 70 wow server was a great success one of the most well known wow 70 TBC servers out there for a while.<br>
Although due too personal reasons i had it shut down.</p>
<p>I don’t say i would be different from those other RSC projects. I just know that they are having issues with stability and are not online 100% of the time.</p>
<p>My other RSC projects never worked because i was un-experienced. Its 4 years ago.</p>
<p>But enough defending myself that’s not why i came here in the first place.</p>
<p>I came here to offer a service, i didn’t come here for much of my own entertainment. I’m already busy with a huge new Wow project anyways.</p>

              <p>Greetings everyone,</p>
<p>Before anyone would come with reply’s  like “why would anyone well educated in coding stick with you?”  :palm:<br>
I’d like to give u my + and - in server development.</p>
<p>I’m not well known in the RS© server branch.<br>
I’m not well educated in C++ nor Java.<br>
I’m decent in SQL/HTML/PHP.</p>
<p>Although,</p>
<p>I’m great at advertising.<br>
I’m great at server management.<br>
I’m great at server investment.<br>
I’m great at team building.<br>
I’m great at Runescape Classic.<br>
I’m great at the “owner” role not the “developer” role.</p>
<p>With all that said, I’m looking for a willing team to develop a RSC project that would focus on being a copy of the original version.<br>
Also new content fitting the original RSC style should be implemented, this obviously doesn’t mean we’re implementing items/monsters that would unbalance the current 3 hit combat system.</p>
<p>We’d probally need to make options to make reaching goals such as “40 atk - 70 str - 1 def - 31 prayer” quicker.<br>
Because plenty of people have done this over and over and over and over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Ideas and suggestions are obviously welcome as the community is small and hard to reach.</p>
<p>With all that said.</p>
<p>I thank u for reading and am looking forward to reply’s.</p>
<p>^yes grammar fails everywhere.</p>
