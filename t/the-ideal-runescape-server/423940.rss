    <title>The ideal Runescape server</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-ideal-runescape-server/423940</link>
    <description>i want to start off by saying im talking about runescape classic, but is known to me as runescape.  i just wanted to voice out because i dont know how to program but there has been times ive wanted to learn just to make a dam game!  The best server would be with slow exp rate, no portals, nothing in the stores but what was in runescape, a rsAngel type of combat system, you get that and your on the way to a very successful server.  this is my opinion i would love for others to give theirs.  maybe if enough sense is on this post then someone would actually make a server like this and most problems would be solved. thnaks</description>

<p>The players who know better were most likely playing all 3 servers as that was when the time people were into account transfers between servers. It worked mostly due to the drop rate satisfaction was almost aced, it was just dumped.</p>

</blockquote>  latifundio thnaks for your views and directions.  i for one would like to see a replica, but with updates(not to match opposing servers).  As far as the server leader, i would agree that all opinion(s) be considered. The main thing people arent getting is that they need to keep the exp rate low to keep everything balanced of goods.  (i think of it as real life, people making minimum wage makes the world turn round the best, because if everyone had it easy with cash they life wouldn’t be Fun!

<p>Dear Lord,<br>
I thank You for this day. I thank You for my being able to see and to hear this morning. I’m blessed because You are a forgiving God and an understanding God. You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing me. Forgive me this day for I have sinned. I ask now for Your forgiveness.</p>
<p>Keep me safe from all danger and harm. Let me start this day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best of each and every day and give my best in all that is put before me.</p>
<p>Clear my mind that I can hear from You. Broaden my mind that I can accept all things that are of You. Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over.</p>
<p>Let me continue to see sin through Your eyes and acknowledge it as evil. And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my wrong doing, and receive the forgiveness of God.</p>
<p>And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus’ example to slip away and find a quiet place to pray. It’s the best response when I’m pushed beyond my limits. I know that when I can’t pray out loud, You listen to my heart.</p>
<p>Continue to use me to do Thy Will. Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to others. Keep me strong that I may help the weak and unsaved.</p>
<p>Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others. I pray for those that are lost and can’t find their way. I pray for those that are misjudged and misunderstood. I pray for those who refuse to share a word from You. I pray for those who don’t know You intimately.</p>
<p>I pray for those that will only read this and not speak this aloud in their own lives. I pray for those that will delete this without sharing it with others. I pray for those that don’t believe … But I thank you that I believe.</p>
<p>I believe that You change people, and I pray for all my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member in their households. I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes that they are out of debt and all their needs are met.</p>
<p>I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is no problem, circumstance, or situation greater than You, Lord. Every battle is in Your hands for You to fight. I pray that these words be received into the hearts of every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses them willingly.</p>
<p>This is my prayer.<br>
In Jesus’ Name,<br>
Amen.</p>
<p>Finished your pray for you, your welcome.</p>

              <p>i want to start off by saying im talking about runescape classic, but is known to me as runescape.  i just wanted to voice out because i dont know how to program but there has been times ive wanted to learn just to make a dam game!  The best server would be with slow exp rate, no portals, nothing in the stores but what was in runescape, a rsAngel type of combat system, you get that and your on the way to a very successful server.  this is my opinion i would love for others to give theirs.  maybe if enough sense is on this post then someone would actually make a server like this and most problems would be solved. thnaks</p>
