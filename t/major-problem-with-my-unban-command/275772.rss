    <title>Major problem with my unban command!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/major-problem-with-my-unban-command/275772</link>
    <description>I have had this problem from the moment I started my server. My unban command does not work. What it does is let say the user &quot;test&quot; got banned. If I did ::unban test, it would unban, or delete, everyone&#39;s name in the bannedusers.txt file. So basically, yeah it unbans him, but it unbans EVERY single person in my bannedusers file, which is bad because there are lots of people in that folder. How would I go about fixing this? Like, what wrong with my unban command? Here it is;

[code]        } else if (command.startsWith(&quot;unban&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3) {
            File file = new File(&quot;./data/bannedusers.txt&quot;);

            if (file.exists()) {
                String victim = command.substring(5);

                sendMessage(&quot;Player &quot; + victim + &quot; successfully unbanned.&quot;);

                try {
                    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
                    BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file));
                    String unban = command.substring(6);
                    String inFile;

                    while ((inFile = in.readLine()) != null) {
                        if (inFile.equalsIgnoreCase(unban)) {// Leave this blank we dont want it to write a file.
                        } else {
                            out.write(inFile);
                        }

                    }
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println(&quot;Error unbanning user&quot;);     
            }
        }[/code]

If you need my ban command, I&#39;ll be happy to supply that for you. Help is very appreciated. Thanks in advance.</description>
