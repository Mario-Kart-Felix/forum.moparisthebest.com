    <title>[639] Dementhium - Bosses help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/639-dementhium-bosses-help/537173</link>
    <description>I am currently trying to figure out how I would make it where bosses will alternate between the player&#39;s they attack. for example if there&#39;s 3 players all attacking bandos, he will only attack player 1, I want him to alternate between attacking the 3 players instead of focusing on just one.
All help is appreciated!</description>
