    <description>Alright, I&#39;m having a party this Friday, and what&#39;s a party without music? I have tons of speakers that I&#39;ve collected over time, all in good and working condition, however, I&#39;m trying to figure out how to arrange them in an acceptable manner so that I get even quality and some awesome bass. I want everything to shake! Here&#39;s what I have..

[b]The party room[/b]

[ul][li]Concrete floors.[/li]
[li]50ft x 25ft - Walls are about 9ft high.[/li][/ul]


[b]Receivers, Amplifiers, and Equalizers[/b]

[ul][li]Denon 7.1 surround receiver (~450wpc if I remember right)[/li]
[li]Yamaha 7.1 surround receiver (~350wpc)[/li]
[li]Pre-amplifier/3-band equalizer[/li]
[li]Amplifier (~200wpc)[/li]
[li]12-band Equalizer (don&#39;t remember the maker)[/li][/ul]


[b]Tower Speakers[/b]

[ul][li]2x JBL Tower Speakers (8-inch poly cone woofer, 4-inch mid-range, 1.5 inch polycell tweeter)[/li]
[li]2x Sony Tower Speakers (12-inch woofer, 3-inch mid-range, 2-inch tweeters - PER SPEAKER)[/li]
[li]2x Kenwood Tower Spekaers (12-inch woofer, 3-inch mid-range, 1-inch tweeters - PER SPEAKER)[/li][/ul]


[b]Surround Speakers[/b]

[ul][li]2x KLH (about 6in. x 6in.)[/li]
[li]4x RCA (small 4in. x 4in. surround speakers - provide excellent noise)[/li]
[li]5x Yamaha (small 4in. x 4in. surround speakers - also go very loud without distortion)[/li][/ul]


[b]Center Speakers[/b]

[ul][li]JBL Center Speaker (contains two 2-inch speakers)[/li]
[li]Yamaha Center Speakers (has five 2-inch speakers inside)[/li][/ul]


[b]Subwoofers[/b]

[ul][li]TheaterSolutions 6-inch powered subwoofer (small but supplies a nice amount of bass for the size)[/li]
[li]RCA 6-inch 125-watt subwoofer (decent sized, supplied good amount of bass)[/li]
[li]Kenwood 12-inch 250-watt subwoofer (shakes absolutely everything)[/li]
[li]Insignia 8-inch subwoofer (gives quite a bit of bass when powered well)[/li][/ul]


[b]Other[/b]

[ul][li]I had a MTX center channel that is about 20in. wide x 8in. tall x 6in. deep, the midranges in it blew out, instead of replacing it with other midranges, I put in two 4-inch high performance subwoofers in it, this &quot;center channel&quot; also has a 1-inch high output tweeter. The subwoofers in it have 150-watts going to each. Shakes stuff, a lot.[/li]
[li]Plenty of thick gauge speaker wire.[/li]
[li]Music will be played off my phone with a 12-band equalizer on my phone.[/li][/ul]


I can tune the speakers and make it sound nice, I&#39;m just not where to place the speakers to make them sound best. As far as tower speakers, the two JBLs with 8-inch subwoofers are by far the most powerful ones, next comes the Sony&#39;s with 12-inch woofers, then the Kenwoods with 12-inch woofers, the Sony&#39;s and Kenwood&#39;s are pretty equal power wise though. 

If any of you have suggestions, let me know. If you need more information, it&#39;s no problem, just ask!</description>
