    <description>Whenever you post you should have your title name describing most of what you need, for example:

Topic Title: Compiling

Text: I need help with my compiler, anyone help?

When you do this it will attract more people to your post, otherwise it is wasting others time by clicking a topic that they do not know anything about.
This will help alot and I did not find this in the rules so, thanks.
