    <title>What is truth or &#39;historical fact&#39;?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-is-truth-or-historical-fact/507503</link>
    <description>Philosophers have reached different conclusions when trying to explain the nature of knowledge and truth. Is truth objective, in the sense that it’s independent of our personal opinions, and something that we discover rather than create or invent; or is it relative to the conceptual system of an individual or an entire culture, so that what qualifies as a fact or a true statement may differ depending on one’s point of view, goals, cultural beliefs, or language? Those who believe in objective facts tend to hold the correspondence theory of the nature of truth, while relativists tend to hold a pragmatic or coherence theory. As an example, consider the controversy over celebrating one of the US national holidays: Columbus Day. In the past, school textbooks taught that Christopher Columbus was a great and admirable hero who, out of a determination to prove that the world was round, &quot;discovered America&quot; and began a process of making the benefits of civilization and Christianity available to millions of people. On the other hand, more recent historians have studied the records of the time and concluded that on the contrary, Columbus was motivated almost entirely by greed for gold, and ruthlessly enforced policies that subjected hundreds of thousands of indigenous people to slavery, torture, and mass murder. What are the &quot;true facts&quot;; and what should we be teaching students in school textbooks? 

Here is a recent news article about decisions reached by a Texas board of education to revise textbooks intended for use in American history classes:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/texas-schoolbook-massacre-rewrites-american-history-1929320.html

Notice that many of the revisions have been strenuously opposed by historians on the grounds that they are &quot;inaccurate&quot;—that is, they don’t correspond to the (objective) facts. On the other hand, comments by board members who made the revisions seem to echo Nietzsche’s claim that &quot;there are no facts, only interpretations&quot;, and perhaps William James’ view that the truth is &quot;what works&quot; best for us. An additional theory that seems very relevant here is that of Foucault, who argued that what constitutes knowledge, truth, and facts, is power: that if you want to understand the nature of knowledge in specific situations, you should study politicians rather than philosophers. In the news article, however, the chairman of the Council for History Education says that the textbook decisions aren’t a political issue but a question of &quot;good history.&quot; 
[u]
So here&#39;s the debate:[/u]

    Do you agree with the historians opposing the textbook revisions that there are objective facts of history that we can discover by studying the available evidence, and that we should try to ensure that history texts correspond with those facts as closely as possible? What is your assessment of the alternative views that no such &quot;objective&quot; truths or facts exist?

    Should &quot;historical accuracy&quot; (correspondence to the facts) be the main consideration in designing school history texts, or are other criteria more important?—for example, in the case of Columbus, should books ignore or downplay his greed and cruelty for the sake of telling a story aimed at engendering patriotism? In your answer, explain whether or not you think that as a student in school you &quot;have a right to learn the truth.&quot;</description>

<p>I’m inclined to believe that those of no natural defects are perfectly capable of learning more abstract thought, none the less the keyword here is ‘learning’, which the vast majority of individuals couldn’t care less about. Here are the rules of our capitalist society for the majority:<br>
Go to school &amp; get qualifications.<br>
Forget everything you’ve learned and thus have qualifications with no base what so ever.<br>
Get a good job.</p>

<p>If a group of 8th graders in their history class are reading a textbook that stated NOTHING but FACT, while still leading to the point, they are almost FORCED into implying their own thoughts. In return, this would create a world of more diverse kids, these kids’ minds would work differently than they currently do. Overall, I think kids would focus less on what they currently do (iphones, clothes, swag, trying to be cool), and focus more on the REAL WORLD, which NO KIDS SEEM TO KNOW OR UNDERSTAND. The idea of that might appeal to you, but it’s horrible for all society, and I personally believe will be one of the MAIN contributors to Armageddon (if not the only contributor).</p>
<p>Conclusion: I think we should put EVERYTHING in the textbooks. I’m 100% positive of the fact that it would do the world good, perhaps put us back on track, because those kids will be concluding their own thoughts, beliefs, reasons, etc., which is the way the world should be.<br>
If every single person in England in the 1600s thought the same way, England would currently not exist, or be thriving at 10x the rate it is now.<br>

          <blockquote>
              <p>What’s even more amusing is that textbook is factually incorrect: Columbus didn’t set out to prove that the world was flat he sat out to Asia and further more they knew that the earth wasn’t flat for a very long time Archimedes developed the formula for the sphere in Ancient Greece, these people weren’t stupid contrary to what people think today.</p>
<p>When we talk about truth in the context of history, we’re talking about something we believe to be true, we use evidence that has been drawn from primary and secondary sources however much of it is the result of speculation.</p>
<p>What’s considered factually correct and incorrect has been the subject of many philosophers; Rene Descartes for instance set out to find what he could and could not prove after he deemed his formal education to be a failure because he wasn’t sure which knowledge he had been taught was correct and which was not; this stemmed from the Scientific Revolution, when Galileo proved that the Sun was the centre of the Universe because of the motion of one of the moons orbiting Jupiter, this contradicted the Bible and thus for Descartes questioned his entire formal education, how can he trust what he is being taught if later on his life he is told it is a lie?</p>
<p>That’s the problem with facts, and largely the problem with scientific methodology, since facts are always open to change and aren’t really fixed quantities, i.e they are falsifiable they usually become obsolete.</p>
<p>This is personally my entire gripe with the current education system, we’re taught everything as a collection of facts, facts that no doubt will be obsolete in the near future. On the matter of history, history in the its true form is merely a story; one cannot accurately portray every event that happened from every possible narrative and thus relies heavily on evidence, but even then new evidence comes into light and even proves old evidence to be false, to give you a very good example Lorenzo Valla was an Italian humanist during the period of the Renaissance, Lorenzo Valla used his linguistic-al knowledge to deduce that an important primary source: The Donation of Constantine was actually a forgery because the language used in that context would have been much different to that originally used (i.e the Latin had a different structure).</p>
<p>The point i’m trying to make here is that the Donation of Constantine (which it is widely believed it was composed around the 8th century) had been considered a fact, a solid primary source for around 7 centuries, and no one knew anything about it they widely regarded it as a fact.</p>
<p>I think people have the right to know the truth and shouldn’t be subject to bias and propaganda, the primary aim of school history lessons should not be a focus on facts but rather on how we attain these facts.</p>
<p>oh p.s for my statement above about the world not being flat:<br>
“The idea that educated men at the time of Columbus believed that the earth was flat, and that this belief was one of the obstacles to be overcome by Columbus before he could get his project sanctioned, remains one of the hardiest errors in teaching.” - ^ Members of the Historical Association 1945, pp. 4–5 In this pamphlet the Historical Association listed “Columbus and the Flat Earth Conception” second of twenty in its first-published pamphlet on common errors in history.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>I recognise that there are objective facts, and these facts should be taught in history class regardless of anything, provided it is relevant, but these objective facts should be taught with as little padding or bias as possible for full context, ‘creative editing’ can really fuck with the way an objective fact is perceived and by claiming that there are no ‘objective facts’ you are doing a disservice to students of history</p>
<p>but of course, I also recognise subjective facts (and/or interpretations of those facts), and while I have no problem with subjective facts being taught I really feel as though they should be taught as a supplement to the objective facts and not the other way around, as is currently the case, and I certainly don’t think that subjective facts should be taught as objective facts as they sometimes are</p>
<p>but defining the two is really quite difficult and simply saying “objective facts should always be taught herpderp” is quite an easy way out of a proper argument I think, if I were to define an objective fact I’d state the obvious, if you can prove something happened with absolute certainty or you can present a piece of information with absolutely no bias then it would be classified as an objective fact, i.e., “abraham lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth” would be pretty undisputed as an objective fact, as to the motives of john wilkes booth that is up to interpretation and would obviously be subjective, as well as whether or not john wilkes booth was a member of the confederate army or was acting on their behalf is again a matter of subjective interpretation (booth was never ‘officially’ a member of the army and stated that he would not enlist, however sources say he had contacts with confederate spies and he was certainly a confederate sympathiser, to say whether or not he was a member of the army or acting on its behalf as an objective fact isn’t possible), using columbus as an example, an often misinterpreted fact is that columbus was the first person to discover america, which is blatantly false, columbus may have been the first person to discover america for the europeans of that time but he certainly wasn’t the first european to discover america, nor the first human to do so</p>
<p>another example is that it’s often stated is that without america europeans would have lost world war 2(or vise verse: europeans didn’t need america), either side cannot be defended from an objective standpoint but the objective facts(as objective as possible) should still be taught, that russia was turning the tide of war long before the d-day landings and that the battle of britiain was a huge success for defending britiain against a german invasion, the subjective facts and interpretations should be taught alongside the objective facts but merely as a supplement, i.e., “america won the war, buuuut the battle of britain and the battle of stalingrad were huge turning points in the war and happened without american assistance”, of course I am slightly biased as I am british but I recognise the role america played in world war 2 and I am not trying to state it wasn’t important, as for my perspective on things I hear all too often, as a matter of fact mind you, that without america europeans would be speaking german, and usually the same people are completely ignorant as to the MASSIVE role that russia played in the war, and of course the opposite perspective would be that american troops weren’t needed in the war and again both these ideas are completely bollocks from an objective point of view</p>
<p>p.s. I’ve proofread this but I may have butchered some of what I mean to say, I was hoping to make a short post and ended up making a longer one which would often mean rewriting it but I simply don’t have time</p>
<p>p.p.s on the topic of having an unbiased discussion: posting both points of views and letting students decide is not a valid way of doing it, presenting both points of view is often done with the implication that both points of view are equally valid when they often aren’t, which is why objective facts should be stated (in as unbiased manner as possible) to prevent ANY misunderstanding, an example would be evolution versus creationism, on one hand you have a scientifically undisputed argument that has withstood centuries of harsh scientific criticism with verified case study after study with more evidence than you can shake a walking stick at, and on the other hand you have a theory with absolutely no evidence or evidence that is highly circumstantial, from an objective point on evolution versus creationism creationism simply does not hold a candle, however the subjective viewpoints are often held in equal regard, the science is there and the science isn’t attacked, the subjective viewpoints are often attacked in substitute of attacking the actual scientific evidence</p>

              <p>When I think of the term ‘truth’, I usually categorize events into that category if they are witnessed by myself and no one else. Nothing is ‘true’ to me unless I have the ability to witness it in full perception, so that there can be no questioning about what happened in that event, even the smallest things.</p>
<p>When I think of the term ‘historical’, I usually judge this by a non-biased description of something. Think of any war that has ever occurred; I would be more likely to believe a phrase along the lines of <span class="bbcode-b">“The United States entered WWI after being heavily pressured by the Lusitania incident”</span>, rather than <span class="bbcode-b">“The United States entered WWI due to many different radical views of politicians upon the many events involving threats against the United States itself”</span>.</p>
<p>In other words, I don’t believe a historical event based on the reasoning of humans, but rather information about the plot of the event. People mix and match words very easily, and the smallest change in a statement can make the event being described turn into something completely different, which is also why I don’t believe in a broad description of something, such as dates or other numbers relating to specific occurrences in the event.</p>

              <p>Philosophers have reached different conclusions when trying to explain the nature of knowledge and truth. Is truth objective, in the sense that it’s independent of our personal opinions, and something that we discover rather than create or invent; or is it relative to the conceptual system of an individual or an entire culture, so that what qualifies as a fact or a true statement may differ depending on one’s point of view, goals, cultural beliefs, or language? Those who believe in objective facts tend to hold the correspondence theory of the nature of truth, while relativists tend to hold a pragmatic or coherence theory. As an example, consider the controversy over celebrating one of the US national holidays: Columbus Day. In the past, school textbooks taught that Christopher Columbus was a great and admirable hero who, out of a determination to prove that the world was round, “discovered America” and began a process of making the benefits of civilization and Christianity available to millions of people. On the other hand, more recent historians have studied the records of the time and concluded that on the contrary, Columbus was motivated almost entirely by greed for gold, and ruthlessly enforced policies that subjected hundreds of thousands of indigenous people to slavery, torture, and mass murder. What are the “true facts”; and what should we be teaching students in school textbooks?</p>
<p>Here is a recent news article about decisions reached by a Texas board of education to revise textbooks intended for use in American history classes:<br>

<p>Notice that many of the revisions have been strenuously opposed by historians on the grounds that they are “inaccurate”—that is, they don’t correspond to the (objective) facts. On the other hand, comments by board members who made the revisions seem to echo Nietzsche’s claim that “there are no facts, only interpretations”, and perhaps William James’ view that the truth is “what works” best for us. An additional theory that seems very relevant here is that of Foucault, who argued that what constitutes knowledge, truth, and facts, is power: that if you want to understand the nature of knowledge in specific situations, you should study politicians rather than philosophers. In the news article, however, the chairman of the Council for History Education says that the textbook decisions aren’t a political issue but a question of “good history.”<br>
<span class="bbcode-u"><br>
So here’s the debate:</span></p>
<pre><code>Do you agree with the historians opposing the textbook revisions that there are objective facts of history that we can discover by studying the available evidence, and that we should try to ensure that history texts correspond with those facts as closely as possible? What is your assessment of the alternative views that no such "objective" truths or facts exist?

Should "historical accuracy" (correspondence to the facts) be the main consideration in designing school history texts, or are other criteria more important?—for example, in the case of Columbus, should books ignore or downplay his greed and cruelty for the sake of telling a story aimed at engendering patriotism? In your answer, explain whether or not you think that as a student in school you "have a right to learn the truth."</code></pre>
