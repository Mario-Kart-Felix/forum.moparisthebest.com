    <description>[size=10pt]OMG HE DECIDED TO MAKE HIS OWN TUTORIAL! Yes I did.[/size]

[b][i]Ok well, I kept seeing questions that had really easy answers to, and that I knew. So instead of posting everywhere, I decided to make my very own and very first tutorial. It is at this point I would like to give credits to Varmisher5150. Because without his tutorial, I couldn&#39;t have gotten started. I have only been doing this for like, 18 hours, so I know very little. These are just what I know the answer to.[/i][/b]

Classes modified: Uh, none?
Description: How to get a model into Metaseq, and edit it.
Difficulty: IDK, really easy though.
Time: Depends on how long you mess around with your model.

[b][i][u][size=10pt]Getting started![/size][/u][/i][/b]

This is just basic stuff. So first, go [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,316506.0.html]here[/url] and download Metasequoia, Item Model ID List, and RSMV. Creds to Varmisher for the tut and posted links.

Now we are going to work with a whip at this moment, because thats one of my current projects. First what you want to do is open up your Item Model ID List. You push ctrl+f, and search for whip.
[IMG]http://i34.tinypic.com/i71mwx.jpg[/img]
So now that you have your ID, open up RS Datmaker, go to file&gt;open. Now go to your RSMV folder, and click models. Under models, search for your number, in this case it&#39;s 5409. Open it up and you should now see a whip.
[IMG]http://i35.tinypic.com/23muhds.jpg[/img]
So now you have your whip, how do you edit it? Well, to edit it, you need to open it up in Metasequoia. Metasequoia only reads .mqo files if I&#39;m correct, so you click file&gt;export&gt;MQO. It should look like this when you get there.
[IMG]http://i36.tinypic.com/2r2so4p.jpg[/img]

[b][i][u][size=10pt]Getting your model base into Metaseq to edit it![/size][/u][/i][/b]

So now that you have converted your model base into a .mqo file, you want to edit it right? Yeah I thought so. So open up Metasequoia, and click file&gt;open. Once again, make sure you are in the models folder. A list of all .mqo files should pop up. Meaning, anything you created and saved should be .mqo, and anything you converted through Datmaker should be there. So double click on 5409, which again is our whip.
[IMG]http://i36.tinypic.com/2duvwoi.jpg[/img]
So now that you have your model, you can do whatever you want with it! I&#39;ll show you how to do some basic editing, like adding primitives, recoloring, stuff like that. Noob stuff basically.

[b][i][u][size=10pt]OMG time to edit it![/size][/u][/i][/b]

Well first off I&#39;ll go over recolor, since that&#39;s basically the easiest thing to do.
In Metaseq, you should see a tab on the left hand side labeled &quot;command.&quot; What you want to do is go to the command tab, and look down a little ways till you see &quot;Mat.&quot; I&#39;ll give you a picture for your benefit.
[IMG]http://i34.tinypic.com/3451nk8.jpg[/img]
You should then see a panel, with different colors in them, titled something like &quot;Mat16&quot; or &quot;Mat 528.&quot;
[IMG]http://i38.tinypic.com/kduc0i.jpg[/img]
Now in the panel you should see six boxes, labeled, &quot;New&quot;, &quot;Prop&quot;, &quot;Clone&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, and &quot;Misc&quot;. One is blank I think.
If you want to add your own map(which is what I suggest you do) click new. It should be labeled &quot;mat1.&quot; It will also be white. So double click it, and it should bring up a nice big box with different color screens and different color hues and stuff.
[IMG]http://i33.tinypic.com/1z1fhgl.jpg[/img]
Simply select your colors and then click ok. You would then scroll over the section you wanted to color, and you should see it highlight to yellow. This will show you the exact area that is going to be colored the color you chose.

[b][i][u][size=10pt]OMG adding primitives, yay![/size][/u][/i][/b]

This is where the work can become a little tedious, until you get the hang of it, but most of the time it&#39;s fun anyways. So go to the box labeled &quot;command&quot; again, and this time you should see a tab that says &quot;Primitive.&quot;
[IMG]http://i33.tinypic.com/208yzyw.jpg[/img]
Now when you click on primitive you should see a box pop up, and it will contain a lot of basic shapes. Go ahead and click on &quot;Property,&quot; So I can show you how to re-size it. Basically what I did with my whip was add a few primitives, la dee da.
[IMG]http://i35.tinypic.com/2utk9c1.jpg[/img]
Then you move it around and rotate it to how you want, and attach it!

[b][i][u][size=10pt]OMG how do I rotate the primitive to my liking?[/size][/u][/i][/b]

Pretty simple answer to that. What you want to do is make sure that the primitive you want to rotate is selected. You can make sure it is selected because when it is, all the lines of it are blue, not purple. So when you have it selected, under the command tab, click &quot;rot.&quot; 
[IMG]http://i38.tinypic.com/azj42a.jpg[/img]
Then click your primitive, and move your mouse around until you find the position you like.


Well, that&#39;s basically it. I learned this all by myself, and I figured I would share with the community. Only thing I learned from a tut was how to get the actualy model into Metaseq, so credits to Varmisher for that I guess. Any CONSTRUCTIVE criticism is welcome. Post any questions you have here and I&#39;ll try to answer them. &gt;.&lt;</description>

thanking him in a topic that he’ll never look at again is gravedigging. there IS a pm button. use that in the future please?<br>

I wish I could do more than recolor. =[[/quote]<br>

<p>What you do is you click on view. It should be under the command tab as well. At the very bottom, when you see it, click it. The when a box pops up, click zoom. The simply zoom in and out using your mouse, you click and hold on the screen, then move your mouse forward or backwards. Try out the different camera movements, get the feel of things.</p>
