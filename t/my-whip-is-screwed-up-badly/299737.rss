              <p>Needs to be manually animated, there are corrupt vskin values near the lower end of the whip, and also, it needs to be moved up into your hand.</p>

              <p>It might be the whip was made with special animations to give it the correct walkin animation and stuff, and without those it looks a little different.</p>
