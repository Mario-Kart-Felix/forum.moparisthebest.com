    <title>Cleaned V4 Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cleaned-v4-help/403422</link>
    <description>Well, i was gonna start my own server, right? Anyway, heres what happened . I got the client, the source cleaned v4, everything... But, its just blank, I wanted to add some commands, but i cant because it isnt declared yet. I ripped the declare void off of delta, and continued to add commands, the only thing is, I get tons of errors because i need to declare the other voids, etc. 
I get messages like:
sM Cannot find symbol, I may have to go in there and do these one by one, Can anybody help me by like giving me like one little tut of adding the command void, and declaring it?
Thanks so much!
I get 82 errors, all of which are cannot find symbols.
