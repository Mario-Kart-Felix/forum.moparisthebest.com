        <pre><code>My dad asked me if I wanted to go fishing with him and my grandpa.  I said "Sure".  He said we'll be going next week.  I said "Okay".  A week passed and dad woke me up at 5 a.m.  I brushed my teeth, put deordorant on, got dressed, got a pillow and hhodie and went to the car.  I fell asleep on the way but woke up when we went to grandpa's cottage to get him and his boat.  Then we put everything in the boat and drove up to the lake.

We bought some minnows, put the boat in the water and we went out onto the lake.  We cast our polls and waited, and waited, and waited.  Then, suddenly, my grandpa's poll gets jerked into the water.  Then the Lockness monster-sized fish swims under the boat, dragging my 70 year old grandpa along.  

It's been 2 years since that day and I haven't seen my grandpa since.  I made a promise to myself and that promise is to kill that fish once and for all.  It's no longer about my grandpa.  It's all about that fish.

My dad invited me to go fishing again.  It's almost like he's been brain washed and forgotten about grandpa.  I go with my dad fishing and I get ready for the most intense month of my life.  We got to Lake Erie and set off.  About 3 hours into the fishing experience, I fall asleep.  Then days later, I wake up in a Russian death camp in Switzerland.  I was on death row for crimes of treason and possession of lethal wepons that was going to be used to assasinate the Australian Embassador, who has recently gone to Norway to talk over the plans of killing the Lake Erie monster.  

At this point I've forgotten everything about my life and the fishing trip that got me into this mess.  I started to plan my escape right after I found out they were going to give me a leathal injection in one month.  I started to think of a way out and what I would do once I got out. I planned to kill a guard, take his gun and find a way out through the air ducts.  I got ready to do this unspeakable act.  It's been 3 weeks since I thought of the plan and today was the day.  At feeding time, I snapped the neck of a guard, took his gun and off I went to find the air conditioning vents. After about 15 minutes, it hits me like a brick to the face, I'm in switzerland.  It's already cold here, so they don't need air conitioning!

I ran around trying to find a way out and then I stumbled upon a big fish tank with a big fish in it which was about 3/4 the size of the fish back in Lake Erie.  I noticed that there was a tunnel in the tank that led outside (I hoped) the base.  I went to the top of the tank and found an opening.  I slipped myself down into the tank quietly and swam to the bottom where the tunnel connected.  

The tunnel went straight up and the sides twisted and turned in a gruesome texture.  My lungs ran out of air and I couldn't hold my breath much longer.  I sped up trying to get out when I noticed some of the grooves on the side held pockets of oxygen.  I quickly swam to one, breathed in as much as I could.  My lungs felt better but I feared I was just stalling my death.  I swam and swam, breathing in as much air as I could along the way.

I started to get tired.  I felt as if I were going to die and I knew I couldn't make it but I gathered my energy and swam.  I could see the light maybe a football field above me but the one thing I forgot about had been stalking me the entire time.  Waiting to strike me at my weekest point in time and this was it.  It swam as fast as it could and touched its mouth to my feet with so much force, it pushed me 3/4 of the way up.  The dumb fish forgot to open it's mouth in time! 

I sped up so fast and finally made it up and out of the water and then out into a huge lake.  i could see the land, it wasn't far. every muscle in my body ached but i had to do it i had to swim to shore i just had to get out of this mess. so i swam as fast as i could to shore and finally made it. i got up on my feet and it hit me like a rabbit hitting a pelican i was freezing, the water was a little above freezing i was in switzerland it's freaking cold here! My body trembled and i passed out.

I woke up in a bed, covered in blankets and wearing oversized clothes next to the bed was an endtable with some funky looking soup and a glass of warm milk, i drank the milk and messed around with the soup with a spoon that was in it i got up and noticed my pinky on my left hand was gone. i panicked but thne i realized i must have gotten hypothermia and they had to amputate it but then i wondered who were "they"? who made the soup? who rescued me? and most important, where am i? 

I left the room, rushing through the house and came upon a room full of different objects. plates, silverware, clocks a book or two all covered in pictures of cats. a plump gray-haired woman in a long pink dress and a neon-green apron came in the room and in a soft sweet voice she asked "what are you doing wiht carol?" and i asked "who is carol?" "carol is my cat" she replied i looked around and saw a cat perched on a table in a wire bird cage "i wasn't doing anyhting with her" i replied then the lady screamed "IT'S A BOY!!!!!!" then she rushed at me with a machete screaming "ALELELELELE" like a crazy arab on drugs i ran past the lady into a kitchen type room and jumped out the window, shattering the glass, i ended up with a few scratches on my arms, face and legs, but nothing serious.

 And i walked down the dirt covered rocky road. and finally, i found a town i went to the local pub and talked with the bagel guy and asked him several questions about the location, name, and the local gossip. I had found out i was in a small town just outside of england and that a crazed american spy had just escaped a russian death camp in switzerland. I felt bad about how much trouble i've caused in europe and i envied all those who were home with there families scared about me coming into their house and killing them all. 

I figured the best way to fix everything was to exterminate the canadian prime minister and kill Clinton. so, after hearing about the prime minister making a trip to the UK i was off, i killed and mugged several people in england and got the money to buy a plane ticket to the UK and was ready to assasinate the canadian prime minister. I made it, i went there and got to the hotel he was supposed to be staying in i snuck through the sewer system and came up under the hotel i was going to kill him in the lobby because the people supposed ot be protecting him wouldn't be in great numbers. i came up i was in the boiler room i was 3 floors and several rooms away from the lobby i killed a janitor by twisting his neck and stole his uniform then i quickly snuck to the lobby and i saw him the canadian prime minister and his sickening grin. i was about to shoot him, when it hit me I NEVER BOUGHT A GUN!!!!!! i couldn't kill him. my plan was ruined then i thought about it and i wondered why i even wanted to kill the canadian prime minister. i left searching for answers to why my life was so random and why i even thought of this.

I went to Germany hoping the people there would have answers unfortunately all they had were goverment agents looking for me so while in germany i found a hollywood production company filming the movie "friction" and i killed a few people there and quickly found the costume guy and forced him to make me a disguise after that i killed him and his family, just for the adrenaline it gave me.

i figured the best way to lay low would be to go to Africa and live there for a few months. I had to slaughter a few paranormal agencies and steal their funding to make it to africa i had to do it, i just had to, for the greater good. so i bought a ticket to a big city in south africa the plane crashed over egypt there were 8 survivors, me, some fat polish guy, an ethiopian kid, a clown addicted to crystal meth, an israeli guy, a tall egyptian woman, an alien named frank and a pirate. We almost starved to death, we ended up killing and eating the polish guy, the tall egyptian woman and the israeli. so me and the rest of the survivors walked until an american plane saw us and picked us up. they captured the alien and quickly sent him to nevada and quickly took us to Cairo. In Cairo i figured i could make a bit of money, so i hired a few prostitutes and slaughtered them. i was a modern day Jack-The-Ripper. by this time i had sinned so much my soul was a wreck. in all countries posters of me were in every city saying they wanted me dead, they offered £1,000,000. 

I was insane, i had no self control what-so-ever, i killed daily, i was surprised i wasn't caught yet. then one day while slaughtering a few vietnamese children in a parking lot a disk-shaped object felw through the sky above me. i ran after it trying to get proof it eventually saw me and chased me it caught me 5 minutes afterward and levitated me onboard. they asked me everyhitng i knew and i told them about frank. frank happened to be their leader on a mission to they affiliates in Cairo about there attack on the U.S. i gave them my condolences and they knocked me out and did surgery on me several times. when i woke up i was in a tube in another government facility. at first i thought it was another russian death camp. but then i noticed the people wathcing me, studying me, they were american, but one of them was an arab. i looked to my right and i saw another tube. the alien it seemed familiar, it was frank. i figured i was in Nevada, in area 51.

After seeing and doing everyhitng i've done so far i thought escaping an american government facility would be a good challenge for my skills. so when one of the guards was patrolling the room i kicked the side of my tube and broke all of the glass, it flew everyhwere. killing the guard, and setting me free. i took his assualt rifle and quickly let frank go, he was dead. but he was wearing an alien-like suit and in the front pocket there was a pistol type thing. and in his other pocket there was a syringe with a clear liquid in it. i quickly gave myself an injection, hoping it would help me in some way. i felt energized. i felt like i could accomplish anything with no consequences. i quickly got everything and ran out of the room into a hallway. inside the hallway was a weird blue-green glow.

As i ran down the hallway i found the exit it was right next to the bathroom, i left area 51 and went to bel-air where i met a black judge who told me about his nephew will, i met Will and we went to his home town, philly we had us some burgers and went to find some hookers, after finding them and paying we started to have sex, shortly i found out mine was a man, and Will's was his cousin ashley, we went on having sex with them until we got tired, after we all got tired i felt like calling up an old friend, i met him on that fateful day the plane i was on crashed, i called up my good friend, bob the midget clown that is addicted to crystal meth, i called him up and told him to bring all the meth he had with him. 

He came to the bel-air mansion and we all had fun with him and that crystal meth, we all became friends that day, and me, will and bob were all friends until me and bob got bored one day, found out will had a dime-bag and we killed him for it. me and bob smoked that dimebag and it was the best pot we ever smoked me and bob went on an epic journey, to Africa where pot grows wild. we killed several japanese businessmen in NYC for the plane ticket/pot money and we went on that plain and we headed to Africa, we got to africa and as we headed out of the airport one of the meth-filled condoms in bob's stomach, popped, i got him out of there so fast i took my pants off to go faster (that's my story and i'm sticking with it) about a mile away form the airport i stopped and got some weed, me and bob smoked that weed and we smoked it good, because i knew this would be the last thing i'd ever smoke with bob. After he died, i cut him open and took out all of the meth i could get, then i hitched a ride back up to the city, sold the drugs and bought a ticket back.

i started hanging out with people that looked like me, talked like me, and did things like me,  they were satanists, after a few months of hanging with them and doing some freaky shit, (having sex with a demon and other stuff) i started thinking about bob, my good old meth addicted clown friend. and i looked into resurection, i wanted to bring him back, so i asked my satanic brothers and they said we could try. and we did, we tried, and we succeeded, we brought him back from the dead, but he was different he jsut wasn't the same bob, he... he.... he just.... he wasn't the way he was before! he was fucked up he ate normal foods, he didn't do drugs, and even worse he didn't eat people with me and the others, but the ritual was done, so i had to do another ritual to kill him again so you know what i did? i shot the cat! i shot the fucking cat! that was the ritual to get more people to give me ideas! now give me ideas damnit........ then i killed bob. 

Then i went to cleveland and i got a flash back, from a long while ago, back in my old life,  I tied up this girl that was 12 with a jumprope, then beat the fuck out of her. By the time I was done, her lip was split, her wrists were bleeding from the rope cuttin into them, one of her eyes was swollen shut, she was missing two teeth, her small tits will entirely black and blue, her pussy was bleeding, and I’m fairly sure that several bones in her feet were broken. When I let her down, she crumpled on the floor and went into a fetal position and just hugged her legs to her chest and sobbed quietly. 

I suddenly got very aroused seeing that, so I pulled out my dick (I has actally hit puberty 12, and was hairy, balls dropped and everything functioning) and started jerking off quietly. Eventually, I started to breathe harder, and she noticed what I was doing, and she just looked at me with this look of absolute horror on her face. It was at that moment that I climaxed and sprayed probably my biggest load of cum ever all over face and chest. Then, I picked up her torn shirt from the ground, wiped off my dick and tossed it to her. I told her to clean herself up and that if she ever told anyone, I would go to her house and kill her while she slept, and that if anyone asked who hurt her, she should say a bunch of highschool kids did it. When I think back on it, I think she was the first girl I ever loved.  After that i went back to Area-51 to finish my life.

As i ran down the hallway i looked into several rooms, each one conveying onto me gruesome creatures, sickening weaponry and even a bit of depression. as i walked down the hallway, my past flooded into me, i thought about how much terror i caused onto the world and i thought about how much pain i've caused and all of the broken homes i've created and i just fell onto my knees right there in the hallway of area 51 and started crying like a baby i had a mental breakdown and i wept like a mother would weep after finding out she accidently smothered her baby. After thinking about this i left area 51, i left my past, and i found the nearest town, went to the church told the priest of my sins he told me god had forgiven me. But that wasn't enough so i joined the church i became a priest.

it's been 10 years since that day and i still wonder about my family and that fish and i hope someday i'll find the answers but at the moment i'll have to say it's the end.

        <p>wow. that story jumps all around! i like it, yet there are some problems. mainly, in the beginning its choppy. [quote=“dragonus18, post:1, topic:146025”]My dad asked me if I wanted to go fishing with him and my grandpa.  I said “Sure”.  He said we’ll be going next week.  I said “Okay”.  A week passed and dad woke me up at 5 a.m.  I brushed my teeth, put deordorant on, got dressed, got a pillow and hhodie and went to the car.  I fell asleep on the way but woke up when we went to grandpa’s cottage to get him and his boat.  Then we put everything in the boat and drove up to the lake.</p>

<p>those few paragraphs were just short sentences. it kinda seems like a 1st graders attempt at a story(no offence).<br>
also, a lot of your sentences begin with “i” and you miss a lot of punctuation. or places where punctuation should be.<br>
but it was a good story. kinda random and it got really weird towards the end. but still not bad.<br>

        <p>im thinking about pko’s suggestion thing, and it makes sense im going to add more in a few days</p>
<p>heres the editted version it took em a few minutes not a few days, please read and C&amp;C</p>
<pre><code>My dad asked me if I wanted to go fishing with him and my grandpa.  I said "Sure".  He said we'll be going next week.  I said "Okay".  A week passed and dad woke me up at 5 a.m.  I brushed my teeth, put deordorant on, got dressed, got a pillow and hhodie and went to the car.  I fell asleep on the way but woke up when we went to grandpa's cottage to get him and his boat.  Then we put everything in the boat and drove up to the lake.

We bought some minnows, put the boat in the water and we went out onto the lake.  We cast our polls and waited, and waited, and waited.  Then, suddenly, my grandpa's poll gets jerked into the water.  Then the Lockness monster-sized fish swims under the boat, dragging my 70 year old grandpa along.  

It's been 2 years since that day and I haven't seen my grandpa since.  I made a promise to myself and that promise is to kill that fish once and for all.  It's no longer about my grandpa.  It's all about that fish.

My dad invited me to go fishing again.  It's almost like he's been brain washed and forgotten about grandpa.  I go with my dad fishing and I get ready for the most intense month of my life.  We got to Lake Erie and set off.  About 3 hours into the fishing experience, I fall asleep.  Then days later, I wake up in a Russian death camp in Switzerland.  I was on death row for crimes of treason and possession of lethal wepons that was going to be used to assasinate the Australian Embassador, who has recently gone to Norway to talk over the plans of killing the Lake Erie monster.  

At this point I've forgotten everything about my life and the fishing trip that got me into this mess.  I started to plan my escape right after I found out they were going to give me a leathal injection in one month.  I started to think of a way out and what I would do once I got out. I planned to kill a guard, take his gun and find a way out through the air ducts.  I got ready to do this unspeakable act.  It's been 3 weeks since I thought of the plan and today was the day.  At feeding time, I snapped the neck of a guard, took his gun and off I went to find the air conditioning vents. After about 15 minutes, it hits me like a brick to the face, I'm in switzerland.  It's already cold here, so they don't need air conitioning!

I ran around trying to find a way out and then I stumbled upon a big fish tank with a big fish in it which was about 3/4 the size of the fish back in Lake Erie.  I noticed that there was a tunnel in the tank that led outside (I hoped) the base.  I went to the top of the tank and found an opening.  I slipped myself down into the tank quietly and swam to the bottom where the tunnel connected.  

The tunnel went straight up and the sides twisted and turned in a gruesome texture.  My lungs ran out of air and I couldn't hold my breath much longer.  I sped up trying to get out when I noticed some of the grooves on the side held pockets of oxygen.  I quickly swam to one, breathed in as much as I could.  My lungs felt better but I feared I was just stalling my death.  I swam and swam, breathing in as much air as I could along the way.

I started to get tired.  I felt as if I were going to die and I knew I couldn't make it but I gathered my energy and swam.  I could see the light maybe a football field above me but the one thing I forgot about had been stalking me the entire time.  Waiting to strike me at my weekest point in time and this was it.  It swam as fast as it could and touched its mouth to my feet with so much force, it pushed me 3/4 of the way up.  The dumb fish forgot to open it's mouth in time! 

I sped up so fast and finally made it up and out of the water and then out into a huge lake.  i could see the land, it wasn't far. every muscle in my body ached but i had to do it i had to swim to shore i just had to get out of this mess. so i swam as fast as i could to shore and finally made it. i got up on my feet and it hit me like a rabbit hitting a pelican i was freezing, the water was a little above freezing i was in switzerland it's freaking cold here! My body trembled and i passed out.

I woke up in a bed, covered in blankets and wearing oversized clothes next to the bed was an endtable wiht some funky looking soup and a glass of warm milk, i drank the milk and messed around with the soup with a spoon that was in it i got up and noticed my pinky on my left hand was gone. i panicked but thne i realized i must have gotten hypothermia and they had to amputate it but then i wondered who were "they"? who amde th soup? who rescued me? and most important, where am i? 

I left the room, rushing through the house and came upon a room full of different objects. plates, silverware, clocks a book or two all covered in pictures of cats. a plump gray-haired woman in a long pink dress and a neon-green apron came in the room and in a soft sweet voice she asked "what are you doing wiht carol?" and i asked "who is carol?" "carol is my cat" she replied i looked around and saw a cat perched on a table in a wire bird cage "i wasn't doing anyhting with her" i replied then the lady screamed "IT'S A BOY!!!!!!" then she rushed at me with a machete screaming "ALELELELELE" like a crazy arab on drugs i ran past the lady into a kitchen type room and jumped out the window, shattering the glass, i ended up with a few scratches on my arms, face and legs, but nothing serious.

 And i walked down the dirt covered rocky road. and finally, i found a town i went to the local pub and talked with the bagel guy and asked him several questions about the location, name, and the local gossip. I had found out i was in a small town just outside of england and that a crazed american spy had just escaped a russian death camp in switzerland. I felt bad about how much trouble i've caused in europe and i envied all those who were home with there families scared about me coming into their house and killing them all. 

I figured the best way to fix everything was to exterminate the canadian prime minister and kill Clinton. so, after hearing about the prime minister making a trip to the UK i was off, i killed and mugged several people in england and got the money to buy a plane ticket to the UK and was ready to assasinate the canadian prime minister. I made it, i went there and got to the hotel he was supposed to be staying in i snuck through the sewer system and came up under the hotel i was going to kill him in the lobby because the people supposed ot be protecting him wouldn't be in great numbers. i came up i was in the boiler room i was 3 floors and several rooms away from the lobby i killed a janitor by twisting his neck and stole his uniform then i quickly snuck to the lobby and i saw him the canadian prime minister and his sickening grin. i was about to shoot him, when it hit me I NEVER BOUGHT A GUN!!!!!! i couldn't kill him. my plan was ruined then i thought about it and i wondered why i even wanted to kill the canadian prime minister. i left searching for answers to why my life was so random and why i even thought of this.

I went to Germany hoping the people there would have answers unfortunately all they had were goverment agents looking for me so while in germany i found a hollywood production company filming the movie "friction" and i killed a few people there and quickly found the costume guy and forced him to make me a disguise after that i killed him and his family, just for the adrenaline it gave me.

i figured the best way to lay low would be to go to Africa and live there for a few months. I had to slaughter a few paranormal agencies and steal their funding to make it to africa i had to do it, i just had to, for the greater good. so i bought a ticket to a big city in south africa the plane crashed over egypt there were 8 survivors, me, some fat polish guy, an ethiopian kid, a clown addicted to crystal meth, an israeli guy, a tall egyptian woman, an alien named frank and a pirate. We almost starved to death, we ended up killing and eating the polish guy, the tall egyptian woman and the israeli. so me and the rest of the survivors walked until an american plane saw us and picked us up. they captured the alien and quickly sent him to nevada and quickly took us to Cairo. In Cairo i figured i could make a bit of money, so i hired a few prostitutes and slaughtered them. i was a modern day Jack-The-Ripper. by this time i had sinned so much my soul was a wreck. in all countries posters of me were in every city saying they wanted me dead, they offered £1,000,000. 

I was insane, i had no self control what-so-ever, i killed daily, i was surprised i wasn't caught yet. then one day while slaughtering a few vietnamese children in a parking lot a disk-shaped object felw through the sky above me. i ran after it trying to get proof it eventually saw me and chased me it caught me 5 minutes afterward and levitated me onboard. they asked me everyhitng i knew and i told them about frank. frank happened to be their leader on a mission to they affiliates in Cairo about there attack on the U.S. i gave them my condolences and they knocked me out and did surgery on me several times. when i woke up i was in a tube in another government facility. at first i thought it was another russian death camp. but then i noticed the people wathcing me, studying me, they were american, but one of them was an arab. i looked to my right and i saw another tube. the alien it seemed familiar, it was frank. i figured i was in Nevada, in area 51.

After seeing and doing everyhitng i've done so far i thought escaping an american government facility would be a good challenge for my skills. so when one of the guards was patrolling the room i kicked the side of my tube and broke all of the glass, it flew everyhwere. killing the guard, and setting me free. i took his assualt rifle and quickly let frank go, he was dead. but he was wearing an alien-like suit and in the front pocket there was a pistol type thing. and in his other pocket there was a syringe with a clear liquid in it. i quickly gave myself an injection, hoping it would help me in some way. i felt energized. i felt like i could accomplish anything with no consequences. i quickly got everything and ran out of the room into a hallway. inside the hallway was a weird blue-green glow.

As i ran down the hallway i found the exit it was right next ot the bathroom, i left area 51 and went to bel-air where i met a black judge who told me about his nephew will, i met Will and we went to his home town, philly we had us some burgers and went to find some hookers, after finding them and paying we started to have sex, shortly i found out mine was a man, and Will's was his cousin ashley, we went on having sex with them until we got tired. After that i went back to Area-51 to finish my life.

As i ran down the hallway i looked into several rooms, each one conveying onto me gruesome creatures, sickening weaponry and even a bit of depression. as i walked down the hallway, my past flooded into me, i thought about how much terror i caused onto the world and i thought about how much pain i've caused and all of the broken homes i've created and i just fell onto my knees right there in the hallway of area 51 and started crying like a baby i had a mental breakdown and i wept like a mother would weep after finding out she accidently smothered her baby. After thinking about this i left area 51, i left my past, and i found the nearest town, went to the church told the priest of my sins he told me god had forgiven me. But that wasn't enough so i joined the church i became a priest.

it's been 10 years since that day and i still wonder about my family and that fish and i hope someday i'll find the answers but at the moment i'll have to say it's</code></pre>
