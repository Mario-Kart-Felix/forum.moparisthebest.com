    <description>Hey guys i have a very small problem that i need help with which is : 
i need to make an npc that takes 100 clay ores from the player in jail and tele him only if he had the 100 clay in invent with him.
i added the npc and made the text that the npc will say when the player talks to him in dialoguehandler &quot;sendNpcChat4(&quot;Hello there &quot;+c.playerName+&quot;!&quot;,&quot;Mine 100 Clay and talk to me to get out of jail!&quot;,&quot;Remember you can&#39;t tele, or talk.&quot;,&quot;Start working and learn not to break the rules next time.&quot;, c.talkingNpc, &quot;King Lathas&quot;);     c.nextChat = 210;&quot;. 
but in clicking buttons i need to add the code that makes the npc do the action of taking the 100 clay and tele him.  :confused:

Thanks In Advance :) !!</description>
