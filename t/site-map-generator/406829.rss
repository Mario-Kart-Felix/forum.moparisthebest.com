    <title>Site Map Generator</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/site-map-generator/406829</link>
    <description>first off this is shit code. if anyone can learn anything off it good for them i just hope it doesnt negatively impact their future programming. the purpose of the program is obviously to generate a sitemap for your website(yes im pretty sure there are open-source programs out there already, so why create one, well thats the next part), the second purpose was to give me something to do, while at the same time helping me learn new api, and increase my overall programming knowledge and skills(which i should have follow convention and other good practices).

why i decided to make a program to do this. well in class our teacher wanted us to use expression web 4 to do this, so we google the steps to do that, well E.W. doesnt have that feature, but u can [b]buy[/b] a plugin to do it! so me being broke, i decide to just program one myself i mean how hard could it be.

i first created the program in vb, then c#(which my teacher assigned my whole class to create one as well in c#), and yesterday and today i ported it to java. i will release the code for whom ever wants it.

constructive criticism would be nice. [s]also im having trouble in java creating a new file. ill post the code and hope someone can tell me what i am doing wrong.[/s]

[code]
// init streamwriter var
// add rootWebDir = jFileChooser1.getSelectedDirectory().toString();
            try
            {
                //new file object
                File saveFile = getNewFile(rootWebDir, &quot;sitemap&quot;, &quot;.html&quot;);
                
                System.out.print(saveFile.createNewFile());
                //Pass the filepath and filename to the StreamWriter Constructor
                BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(saveFile.getName()));// change to saveFile.toString()

                // write txtbox&#39;s content to file
                bw.write(jTextArea1.toString());// change to jTextArea1.getText();

                //Close the file
                bw.close();

                // show message box displaying path to saved file.
                //MessageBox.Show(&quot;File saved: &quot; + fileName());
                jTextArea2.removeAll();
                jTextArea2.append(&quot;File saved: &quot; + saveFile.toString());
                jDialog1.setVisible(true);
            }
            catch (Exception x)
            {
                x.printStackTrace();
                //Console.WriteLine(&quot;Exception: &quot; + x.Message);
            }
            finally
            {
                //Console.WriteLine(&quot;Executing finally block.&quot;);
            }

private File getNewFile(String path, String filename, String ext)
        {
            int fileNum = 0;
            File file = new File(path/*+File.pathSeparator*/+filename+fileNum+ext);//replace File.pathSeparator with &quot;\\&quot;
            
            while(file.exists())
            {
                file = new File(path /*+File.pathSeparator*/ + filename + fileNum++ + ext);//replace File.pathSeparator with &quot;\\&quot;
            }
            
            return file;

        }

[/code]

[s]this is what i get after i try to save the file(no error is printed, this is in my dialog box i display):[/s]
&lt;blockquote&gt;File saved: nullsitemap2.html&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[s]so i believe it is saving the files i just dont know where b/c i cant see it in the directory i would believe its in... i believe its saving it since the filename increments everytime.[/s] while typing this i thought of something to look at that may be the problem/solution.

Download (i have removed any executables, just to remove any possibility of trying to distribute malicious code or w/e; so everything in downloads should be resources and source code)
vb project: [url=http://db.tt/uu8Wnjt]http://db.tt/uu8Wnjt[/url]
c# project: [url=http://db.tt/tjFd1kH]http://db.tt/tjFd1kH[/url]
java project: [url=http://db.tt/nry9TT0]http://db.tt/nry9TT0[/url]

edit: above problem solved... the string variable i used was never assigned anything. so that was a quick fix. also i thought the File.pathSeparator was \ for windows and / for unix, i was wrong, if i was thinking what i read pathseparator i would have known &quot;;&quot; so i fixed that also. if u want the fixed java download i can do that but its an easy fix and if no one download it then its just a waste of time.

also jTextArea.toString() doesnt give u the text in that text area, it gives u a list of all the properties in string form... found out u want to use getText()</description>
