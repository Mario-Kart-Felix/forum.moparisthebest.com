1.do you have sugestions for server i can use as a base ( i wanted a [508] )

2. i know how i get a no-ip adress but is it free forever? cause mai friend said it only lasts a while, and then u need a new account to make the server still be online.

3.how do i put the server on my web? so people don&#39;t have to download my server. is it posible to make it on my forum or do i need to put it on my web.

4. how do i edit existing items? i mean to make a phat black or something. can u tell me the exact program for making custom items? is it model making something?

5.how can i make an item/potion give me 1000/99 health? and also how can i make it so just me [the onwer] have 1000 health.?
