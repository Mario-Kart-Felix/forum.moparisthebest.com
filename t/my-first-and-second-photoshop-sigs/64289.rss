I’m gonna tell you something that nobodys ever said before!<br>
lol<br>
When making a signature, make it smaller lolz,<br>
Don’t make a background and then slap a picture on it, thats nasty and should be burned<br>
Don’t you know how to feather?<br>
Its a good skill if you know how…<br>
Makes it look better,<br>
And you should definitly try making the bg and the render similar colors.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>why do you hate every sig that people make… its his first and second gve him a break and a few tips and make him feel good about what he has done and tell him what to do better… dont come in and freakin say his sig is shit that is just mean.[/quote]<br>
