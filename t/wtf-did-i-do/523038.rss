    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/wtf-did-i-do/523038</link>
    <description>I think theirs something wrong with my client...  I was just on it yesterday and didn&#39;t mess with it at all...I&#39;ve thinking the problem with my cache...

My original cache i got the heap is out of memory error so i reverted to a little older version of my cache i made and got a NullPointerException error then i reverted to the base cache and got the same error as the above, but the last two only pop up when i log in to the game

How do I fix this?  I&#39;m so confused on how this happen since i was just on it yesterday from just making the slayer tower functional..,but that&#39;s in the source not the client????

Please help</description>
