    <title>Flower downloadable PSN game</title>

    <description>  Well guys i just downloaded my demo of Flower today, and i had multiple orgasms while playing it. Here is kinda how the game play is worked out. It starts of as just a single leaf petal that gets blown off of an flower, and using the six axis you control the wind and direction of this petal in the massive and beautiful landscape.

 The Objective of the game is quite simple but very symbolic, you use your petal to interact with other flowers to take a petal from them and then eventually you heal up a part of the landscaping that has died or turned white for no given reason. I honestly think this game like this are amazing. So now to get to the question, What do you guys think about games like this?</description>
