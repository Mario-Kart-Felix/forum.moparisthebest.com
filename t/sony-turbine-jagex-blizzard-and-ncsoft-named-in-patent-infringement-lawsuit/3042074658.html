<p>what’s unbelievable is that you’re so dumb you think jagex doesn’t have integrity because they send “harassments” to people in response to violations of their terms of use. i would recommend that in future bursts of retardation you at least <span class="bbcode-i">try</span> to utilize logic, but i doubt you’ll take heed seeing as how you’re fueled by bias.</p>

        <p>They don’t have integrity; do read what I’ve said in that post.</p>
<p>If you’re a company and you are sending multiple emails/letters to someone with threats to take legal action, even when you don’t have any REAL legal standing because the target isn’t actually undermining your rights, then you are relying on FUD tactics and the fact that you are a big company with money, compared to the target who (in cases related to runescape cheating and emulation) is often an individual without comparable wealth.<br>
This is why they lack integrity.</p>
<p>One of the messages sent to this website demanded the removal of scar and srl discussion sections, among a laundry list of things. This is an example of a claim that Jagex had no right to make, yet they did because they could and because it added to the list of ‘things that we’ll sue you for’.<br>
Emails like these, which contain claims that aren’t backed by law, are frivolous. Continuing to send frivolous messages that contain threats of further legal action is a form of harassment.</p>
<p>The reality is that most big companies rely on a person’s fear of being sued, rather than actually suing the person, to achieve their desires.<br>
Doing so is a form of bullying or, as I might have stated in a previous post, ‘shitting on the little guy’.</p>
<p>I suggest that <span class="bbcode-u">you</span> utilize logic next time you attempt to call someone out.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes - I’m biased on this matter. Tough shit.</p>

        <p>are you saying that jagex lacks integrity because they don’t follow through with their claims for legal action? or do you honestly think they don’t have a valid right to sue in situations like these? normally i’d assume you’re not an idiot and go with the former, but you’ve already demonstrated that you are, so i don’t get the chance to assume anything, which screws up my entire flow. oh well, i guess we’ll start at the bottom and work our way up, taking frequent breaks for snacks and nap time.</p>
<p>maybe jagex didn’t have proper authority to specifically request that discussion of scar and srl be removed, because scar probably doesn’t explicitly only support use for runescape, but it’s quite obvious that’s the reason it was created. for other things like reverse engineering of their client in order to create and host private servers, or cheat with a modified client, that’s perfectly valid. i’m not a lawyer, but i think it’s quite obvious that if a company releases a product along with terms of use, and you use the product but violate the terms of use (esp. for destructive means), they can sue you. it will probably be a waste of their money and effort, which is why they don’t follow through with such claims, but the fact stands that they aren’t in the wrong.</p>
<p>in fact, it’s curious that you take on a “jagex is the enemy” attitude. this was my point earlier when i commented not about you having bias but about the fact that having the bias makes you sound stupid. i guess i shouldn’t be that harsh, though, seeing as how you did try to use logic this time.</p>

        <p>The only time that they would ever succeed at suing Moparisthebest (the owner, not the site) is if his server, which hosts this site, actually stored their intellectual property.<br>
With that said, Mopar has made a sedulous effort to keep his server free of such files.</p>
<p>They can’t sue him because users of his site write their own code which may just happen to allow automation of the Runescape game.</p>
<p>They can’t sue him because Scar, which may or may not have been developed with cheating in mind, can be applied to Runescape automation.</p>
<p>They can’t sue him for linking to off-server resources.</p>
<p>They can’t sue him because of the private servers on Moparscape; that ‘software’ (as low as the quality may be) may well have been written using black box auditing techniques to acquire packet information, and as such means that the client was not necessarily reverse engineered.<br>
The clients used to interact with the servers are linked to, and are not stored on this server.</p>
<p>They did try to threaten him due to incorrect use of their trademarked word, ‘Runescape’, but this was fixed up by properly displaying it with the copyright symbol and the name of their company.</p>
<p>They can’t sue websites like RSCAngel either (a large rs classic server) as the software was created using black-box techniques (not reverse engineering the client) to acquire the information necessary to build the server software. The associated client, again, is stored off of their website.<br>
Note that Jagex did try the usual stuff; legal letters with threats of proceedings, etc.</p>
<p>Oh, and the reason that I have the ‘us against them’ attitude is because I was speaking to Mopman not so long ago about how Jagex staff would, probably, not begrudge us for trying to have fun with their game in our own way. He then told me that Andrew personally really hated cheaters (which is fair enough, but that’s a game that can be played by two).</p>
<p>I don’t know what else I can say to change your point of view, because we’re dealing with a multi-national discussion here and I’m basing what I’ve got to say on laws in Australia and America.<br>
I’m not sure about the legality of linking to ‘questionable’ resources in Britain; it may well be illegal there – but that isn’t going to play if they’re trying to sue someone overseas.</p>

<p>But we are doing something unlawful. And those rs bin downloads are only the direct things we are doing. Moparisthebest’s client is hosted on this server, along with Jagex’s 317 cache. Moparisthebest’s downloads folder contains several copies of the 317 client, modified or unmodified doesn’t matter. <a href="http://moparscape.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">MoparScape.org</a> forums have many clients and related resources as attachments (which use to be against policy here, but really isn’t enforced enough).</p>
<p>Then there’s all the different code snippets from the client, documentation on the different rs protocols, all of the many bot software programs that have been uploaded to this site. The different updater logs and several classes in the most popular rsps software are all evident signs that the client has been reverse engineered. All of the aforesaid gives evidence that the client has been reversed engineered. You can’t use “block-box” techniques to know that their clients have so-and-so classes and so-and-so fields.</p>
<p>And beyond the obvious, Mopar would likely still be at fault if he didn’t have one single thing above on his servers. But I really don’t want to get into legal details about why or why not this community is at fault. The point is, Jagex has too much legal standing to even foolishly think this community has a chance. We are only still up because Jagex hasn’t spent the money on building a case against us yet. But now that they have their own inhouse expert attorney on intellectual property, money isn’t a big issue anymore. That lawyer is going to get paid whether or not he is building a case against this site.</p>

        <p>When I mentioned black box techniques, I was specifically talking about the development of server-side software (as such, it’s completely possible to document packets using something like WireShark).</p>

I still believe that they would not have the power to do anything though if those files were not on the server, simply because this is only a forum for communication.</p>

<p>Not illegal. Not in the EU, at least, I have no idea about any other country. There are laws surrounding what you can do with the result of your reversing, for example commercial use is pretty much forbidden unless its for interoperability etc.</p>
<p>The UK (no idea about other countries) will not enforce a contract disallowing reverse engineering when it would be legal - in other words, the TOS cannot randomly make up a law that says you can’t reverse it - if the reversing and what you’re doing with it is legal under UK law, you can do what you like no matter what the TOS says.</p>
<p>ps They don’t have an inhouse lawyer yet, they appear to be still lookin’ <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

<p>Not illegal. Not in the EU, at least, I have no idea about any other country. There are laws surrounding what you can do with the result of your reversing, for example commercial use is pretty much forbidden unless its for interoperability etc.</p>
<p>The UK (no idea about other countries) will not enforce a contract disallowing reverse engineering when it would be legal - in other words, the TOS cannot randomly make up a law that says you can’t reverse it - if the reversing and what you’re doing with it is legal under UK law, you can do what you like no matter what the TOS says.</p>
<p>ps They don’t have an inhouse lawyer yet, they appear to be still lookin’ ;)[/quote]</p>
<p>Hmm, I was mistaken then. But when they do get a lawyer, things are going to be different, etc.</p>

<p>Last time I checked, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/rs/bin/" data-bbcode="true">all these downloads</a> are Jagex’s intellectual property. But hey, that could have changed in the last few minutes. :rolleyes:[/quote]</p>
<p>They put them up for public download do they not?  I’m not doing anything more than a caching proxy does.  Also I don’t keep the client or cache on this server, instead it is on the server that <a href="http://cache.moparisthebest.com/">cache.moparisthebest.com</a> points to.</p>
<p>I am not doing anything illegal running these discussion forums, but if someone thought I was, I could just move the server to a third world country who wants my monthly hosting check more than they care about any laws.</p>
