    <title>Sony, Turbine, Jagex, Blizzard, and NCsoft named in patent infringement lawsuit</title>

    <description>I was expecting someone else to post this for nearly a week, but no one did. :(

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to be a World of Lawsuits (TM) recently in our industry. Bloggers are being sued for libel, NCsoft is being sued for patent infringement, Linden Labs is being sued for trademark violations, Turbine is suing Atari, and now five companies are all being sued over a patent dispute.

The Boston Globe has reported that Paltalk Holdings Inc. has filed a complaint in Texas against Sony Corp., Activision Blizzard Inc., Turbine Inc., NCsoft Corp., and Jagex Ltd. all for games that violate their patent on computers sharing data so that all users can see the same virtual environment. The games in question are EverQuest, World of Warcraft, Lord of the Rings Online, Guild Wars, and RuneScape (in order of the companies as named above.)

What makes this lawsuit different from the standard patent shakedowns that we&#39;ve been reporting on is that the patent has already been successfully used in court. Paltalk has already sued, and won against, Microsoft.

In 2006, the company sued Microsoft over the multiplayer features included in Halo series. Microsoft took the suit to court, but ended up settling with Paltalk in mid-trial by paying an undisclosed sum of money. This win gives the lawsuit more legs to stand on, hence why Paltalk is now going after all of the industry bigwigs, including Activision Blizzard.

If you&#39;re confused as to how Microsoft settling to Paltalk gives them more credibility in court, it&#39;s because Microsoft&#39;s bow lends credit to the validity of the patents. This prior case can be used in court, making the suit hard to defend against. Turbine and NCsoft, as stated before, are also already involved in suits of their own, making legal defense trickier for these two companies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I think it&#39;s ridiculous, yet amusing at the same time. Microsoft settled to them, so I&#39;d imagine the other companies will, too. I&#39;d like to see what comes of this in the upcoming months. :D</description>

<p>Last time I checked, <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/rs/bin/" data-bbcode="true">all these downloads</a> are Jagex’s intellectual property. But hey, that could have changed in the last few minutes. :rolleyes:[/quote]</p>
<p>They put them up for public download do they not?  I’m not doing anything more than a caching proxy does.  Also I don’t keep the client or cache on this server, instead it is on the server that <a href="http://cache.moparisthebest.com">cache.moparisthebest.com</a> points to.</p>
<p>I am not doing anything illegal running these discussion forums, but if someone thought I was, I could just move the server to a third world country who wants my monthly hosting check more than they care about any laws.</p>

Then there’s all the different code snippets from the client, documentation on the different rs protocols, all of the many bot software programs that have been uploaded to this site. The different updater logs and several classes in the most popular rsps software are all evident signs that the client has been reverse engineered.

<p>Hmm, I was mistaken then. But when they do get a lawyer, things are going to be different, etc.</p>

Being a multi million dollar company doesn’t mean they can get their way if we aren’t doing something unlawful.[/quote]</p>
<p>But we are doing something unlawful. And those rs bin downloads are only the direct things we are doing. Moparisthebest’s client is hosted on this server, along with Jagex’s 317 cache. Moparisthebest’s downloads folder contains several copies of the 317 client, modified or unmodified doesn’t matter. <a href="http://MoparScape.org" rel="nofollow noopener">MoparScape.org</a> forums have many clients and related resources as attachments (which use to be against policy here, but really isn’t enforced enough).</p>
<p>Then there’s all the different code snippets from the client, documentation on the different rs protocols, all of the many bot software programs that have been uploaded to this site.

All of the aforesaid gives evidence that the client has been reversed engineered. You can’t use “block-box” techniques to know that their clients have so-and-so classes and so-and-so fields.</p>
<p>And beyond the obvious, Mopar would likely still be at fault if he didn’t have one single thing above on his servers. But I really don’t want to get into legal details about why or why not this community is at fault. The point is, Jagex has too much legal standing to even foolishly think this community has a chance. We are only still up because Jagex hasn’t spent the money on building a case against us yet. But now that they have their own inhouse expert attorney on intellectual property, money isn’t a big issue anymore. That lawyer is going to get paid whether or not he is building a case against this site.</p>

With that said, Mopar has made a sedulous effort to keep his server free of such files.</p>
<p>They can’t sue him because users of his site write their own code which may just happen to allow automation of the Runescape game.</p>
<p>They can’t sue him because Scar, which may or may not have been developed with cheating in mind, can be applied to Runescape automation.</p>
<p>They can’t sue him for linking to off-server resources.</p>
<p>They can’t sue him because of the private servers on Moparscape; that ‘software’ (as low as the quality may be) may well have been written using black box auditing techniques to acquire packet information, and as such means that the client was not necessarily reverse engineered.<br>
The clients used to interact with the servers are linked to, and are not stored on this server.</p>
<p>They did try to threaten him due to incorrect use of their trademarked word, ‘Runescape’, but this was fixed up by properly displaying it with the copyright symbol and the name of their company.</p>
<p>They can’t sue websites like RSCAngel either (a large rs classic server) as the software was created using black-box techniques (not reverse engineering the client) to acquire the information necessary to build the server software. The associated client, again, is stored off of their website.<br>
Note that Jagex did try the usual stuff; legal letters with threats of proceedings, etc.</p>
<p>Oh, and the reason that I have the ‘us against them’ attitude is because I was speaking to Mopman not so long ago about how Jagex staff would, probably, not begrudge us for trying to have fun with their game in our own way. He then told me that Andrew personally really hated cheaters (which is fair enough, but that’s a game that can be played by two).</p>
<p>I don’t know what else I can say to change your point of view, because we’re dealing with a multi-national discussion here and I’m basing what I’ve got to say on laws in Australia and America.<br>
I’m not sure about the legality of linking to ‘questionable’ resources in Britain; it may well be illegal there – but that isn’t going to play if they’re trying to sue someone overseas.</p>

<p>maybe jagex didn’t have proper authority to specifically request that discussion of scar and srl be removed, because scar probably doesn’t explicitly only support use for runescape, but it’s quite obvious that’s the reason it was created. for other things like reverse engineering of their client in order to create and host private servers, or cheat with a modified client, that’s perfectly valid. i’m not a lawyer, but i think it’s quite obvious that if a company releases a product along with terms of use, and you use the product but violate the terms of use (esp. for destructive means), they can sue you. it will probably be a waste of their money and effort, which is why they don’t follow through with such claims, but the fact stands that they aren’t in the wrong.</p>

              <p>They don’t have integrity; do read what I’ve said in that post.</p>
<p>If you’re a company and you are sending multiple emails/letters to someone with threats to take legal action, even when you don’t have any REAL legal standing because the target isn’t actually undermining your rights, then you are relying on FUD tactics and the fact that you are a big company with money, compared to the target who (in cases related to runescape cheating and emulation) is often an individual without comparable wealth.<br>
This is why they lack integrity.</p>
<p>One of the messages sent to this website demanded the removal of scar and srl discussion sections, among a laundry list of things. This is an example of a claim that Jagex had no right to make, yet they did because they could and because it added to the list of ‘things that we’ll sue you for’.<br>
Emails like these, which contain claims that aren’t backed by law, are frivolous. Continuing to send frivolous messages that contain threats of further legal action is a form of harassment.</p>
<p>The reality is that most big companies rely on a person’s fear of being sued, rather than actually suing the person, to achieve their desires.<br>
Doing so is a form of bullying or, as I might have stated in a previous post, ‘shitting on the little guy’.</p>
<p>I suggest that <span class="bbcode-u">you</span> utilize logic next time you attempt to call someone out.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes - I’m biased on this matter. Tough shit.</p>

<p>what’s unbelievable is that you’re so dumb you think jagex doesn’t have integrity because they send “harassments” to people in response to violations of their terms of use. i would recommend that in future bursts of retardation you at least <span class="bbcode-i">try</span> to utilize logic, but i doubt you’ll take heed seeing as how you’re fueled by bias.</p>

              <p>While I wouldn’t shed a tear seeing all of those companies, mainly Jagex, lose in court and have to pay millions of dollars to someone else, the patent is completely ridiculous.  They seriously patented the idea of an ‘online world’?  That sounds like it could apply to this forum, as it is a sort of an online world, maybe they will sue me next.</p>
<p>I hate ridiculous software patents.</p>

I hate to say “its the principle” again (seriously wtf that seems to be all I’ve said all week) but as funny as it would be to see Blizzard and Jagex get a taste of their own medicine, software patents are so inappropriate, and ones like this so ridiculous, that this just makes me sad <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I’d say it was opening the floodgates to more dumb patents but unfortunately that precedent has already been set 1000 times over:(</p>
<p>EDIT: That said, they do have a defense, I’m fairly sure US patents are supposed to be like trademarks in that failure to enforce rights is grounds for losing them - why have paltalk waited like, a decade? <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/confused.png?v=5" title=":confused:" class="emoji" alt=":confused:"><br>
