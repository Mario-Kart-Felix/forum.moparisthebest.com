    <description>[shadow=blue,left]Right, so I&#39;ve seen this on another server and loved the idea of it. 

the mods and admins had crowns on the mini-map to show them-selves and they had normal crowns next to their name , then they typed ::modoff and they both dissapeared , so as if they was normal players, but they still had their commands?

has anyone got a command with the crowns on mini-map on/off and the crown next to name on/off :) thanks.[/shadow]</description>
