              <p>well i know uptill 614s but im guessing that you would have to make a shophandler and if it already has it then look for a pricelist.cfg or something like that and if not those two im guessing its in buttonhandler</p>

              <p>i think you add a statement where after you spawn the item you remove the coins and if theres not enough coins player get message (" you dont have enough coins") im not sure about 718s XD or remove item command and add shops ^^</p>
