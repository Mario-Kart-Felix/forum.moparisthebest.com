              <blockquote>Victoria Richardson, 42, from Hove, East Sussex, was burgled last week, losing an iPhone, a Nintendo DS games console, a handbag containing a purse, cash and debit cards and a black Toshiba laptop.
<p>When she later logged into her Facebook account she found the burglar who had rifled through her belongings had also invaded her Facebook account.</p>
<p>One message left on the site read: “on my new laptop”. The next said: “Listening to music on my new phone feels so good.”</p>
<p>The callous thief then mocked the fact they had left Victoria’s television because it was ‘rubbish’, adding: “I have the laptop , phones ok but a bit scratched itll do, tv was rubbish so I left it , ds was a bonus, now to the porn shop, thankyou toshiba is my favourite make”.</p>
<p>The final post read: “regards your night time burglar”.</p>
<p>Ms Richardson said: "I felt very spooked. I have never felt like that before. It felt like they were rubbing my nose in it.</p>
<p>"They have been in your physical space, and then they are in your online space. My friends could all see what they were writing so it was really degrading.</p>
<p>“It is bad enough being robbed in the first place but this invasion of my privacy has made it doubly painful.”</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Sussex Police said: "Being burgled is traumatic enough for any family but for the culprit to apparently use their stolen possessions to publicly gloat over the crime is a sinister twist.</p>
<p>“As with all burglaries we are taking the matter seriously and a thorough investigation is under way to bring this offender to justice.”</p>
</blockquote> for those that are to lazy… and I find this a bit funny.
