    <title>What game should I buy? (XBOX 360)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-game-should-i-buy-xbox-360/265280</link>
    <description>If I buy Assassin&#39;s Creed, because of it&#39;s price.. I can buy another game along with it, with the exception of GH3.

I&#39;m not sure what other XBOX 360 games are good, so if you can suggest any go ahead.

I currently have: Halo 3, Call Of Duty 4
I don&#39;t want: Call Of Duty 5

pleax, etc</description>

You still don’t get the whole purpose of GH and Rock band. So till you do, hush up.<br>

<p>I don’t play video games as an attempt to emulate the same activity in real life. I don’t play racing games because I want to race in real life, I don’t play assassins creed because I want to be an assassin, and I sure as hell don’t play guitar hero because I want to play guitar.</p>
<p>It’s a fun and challenging game. It’s like constant perfect timing to the rhythm of the music. And it’s especially fun when you get better and your fingers are going lightspeed and doing things they could never do before. The best part about it is playing it with friends.</p>

yes but going to war has some considerable drawbacks, like oh i don’t know death. the worst that could happen to you with a guitar is a string snaps and whips you on the finger. As for a band you can play a song in the background and play along with it. A guitar can be easily obtained at a shop whereas i dont think your local argos keeps aston martin’s in stock do you? Songs to play are littering the internet for people to find and play and if you were that concerned about it you would write your own<br>

<p>I could very easily roll a ball over some sticker dots and make some little tissue paper ghosts chase it, but I don’t think it would be as fun as Pac Man.</p>
<p>What is the point of Home? What is the point of Live or PSN? I have friends I can go and talk to them. Why play Little Big Planet if I’m living on one already? Why do anything?<br>

<p>I can say the SAME exact thing about the war games or racing games I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>It’s a challenge. I play guitar and I have for a long time and I would still rather play Guitar Hero.</p>
<p>It would be more fun to sit around with friends trading off on Guitar Hero or battling than to sit around with friends and trade off an actual guitar.</p>

<li>PS3 IS SHIT, SDFU</li>

<p>Why the fuck did you bring up the PS3 at all? He asked for a game to buy for his 360, the PS3 is totally out of the question.[/quote]<br>
Wow you’re a fucking idiot, did you even read my response to his post? quite evidently not<br>
If you just go and join the army there is no fun element in there because you are in danger and you wont get to do what you want straight away, there are rules, regulations etc tonnes of things that dont exist in a GAME. When playing guitar hero the idea is to emulate playing a guitar, so why the fuck not just play the guitar when it will be exactly the same as the game except there are more options? You just don’t think do you? god damn idiot</p>
