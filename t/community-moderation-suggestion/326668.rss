    <description>[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,408682.msg3018274.html#msg3018274]Allow users to select if they think a post breaks the rules, and if a certain number of different people feel this way, the post will be hidden by default, with an option for others to see it.[/url]

That is listed as a todo, so I would like to do it.

How is the question, so I am asking for feedback before I do it this way that people might not like.  Also, if you think this is a bad idea, say so, it&#39;s all up for discussion.

My idea is to use the existing &#39;report to moderator&#39; functionality already built into the forum, and if X (we will have to pick a good value for X) number of people report a particular post and/or topic, I can either:

a) hide it by default, marking it as potential spam, allowing individual users to click &#39;show me this post&#39; as they wish.
b) change it to an un-approved post/topic, requiring a staff member to look at it and either approve or delete it.

Either way, the report would still remain and a staff member would punish the offender appropriately.  This would simply allow users to immediately take care of blatant spam even if a staff member was not on.

I am also thinking this shouldn&#39;t be available to brand new members, maybe only &#39;Members&#39; (50 post count) and up?

So, start the discussion.</description>

              <p>Just my 2c on this whole idea of community moderation, a lot of you probably already know what I mean if you use any form of social media/news aggregation sites (ie, reddit).</p>
<p>The <span class="hashtag">#1</span> problem with community moderation is it turns everything into a popularity contest. For example,<br>
User1: runescape is shit because x/y/z<br>
User2…n: omg ur shit, - rating dikhed<br>
Net result: Thread burried, user receives bad rep purely for saying something which isn’t necessarily wrong but against the popular belief. In this example, although maybe on this topic would be unlikely to happen, you could lose a really interesting conversation and back/forwards between both sides. Then you end up getting popular users who attract more attention for no real reason other than they appear popular (read: have higher votes) and a backlash to lower voted users, which only attracts more negativity. Also you end up with down rating cliques forming who can bury things just because they hold sway over a few users.</p>
<p>It’s a community anti-magnet, where + attracts + and - attracts -</p>
<p>Also, where do you draw the line between comment and post? It’s far too open to individual interpretation, and I’m pretty sure if you looked up reply in a dictionary a few would probably list see: comment.</p>
<p>Further edit:<br>
Personally, I think a better approach to this would be to move forward from using flat, linear and, let’s face it, ancient bbs style forums and move towards proper branching/threaded forums (again, reddit). As far as guaging users and input, I don’t know, maybe some form of signal to noise ratio? A representation of post count vs rep/rating per post or overall vs length of time browing forums vs how long user has been registered for. Anyways, that’s more idle thought than anything.</p>

<p>Anyways, I love how everyone see’s it being abused and such. Honestly who cares, this isn’t a site that has 1000’s of new users everyday, it’s the same 100~ people active everyday basically.</p>

              <p>But the whole livelihood of this forum is to flame. That’s like the main thing going for it. Sure there are decent discussions from time to time. But the basic truth is, people like the attention they get when they flame the shit out of a retard. And to just have a flame war tucked away in comments it most likely won’t get the attention it would have gotten otherwise, and will more than likely decrease flaming greatly.</p>
<p>Not to mention allowing people to flame is condoning something that is against this forums’ rules. I mean sure we’ve always done it, but it wasn’t ever encouraged.</p>

<p>I think its a good idea. It allows people to have a dig at them while keeping the thread on track. In this community people are going to abuse each other hidden posts or not.<br>

<p>I see where frank_ is coming from, at first commenting on a post sounds like a stupid idea.  But I really think, in this community, it would stop thread de-railing and keep only relevant comments in the thread.</p>

<p>People can quote for commenting.</p>

</aside>
<p>I think that is the problem, when someone posts something stupid.  Now whether you have value to add to the conversation, or whether you just want to call them on being an idiot, you have to make a post, then they fight back, derailing the thread.  If this system was implemented, and someone, for example, posted an idiotic comment possibly with wrong information in it, a person simply wanting to flame them would use the rating/comment system, and a person wanting to provide actual content to the thread, such as correct info, would make a post.[/quote]</p>
<p>Actually, now that I think about it that way, it is a very good idea.<br>
Limiting actual posts to only valuable and relevant information to the thread, and keeping spam in offside comments.</p>

<p>I think being able to comment but give zero ‘rep’ to the comment is the way to go.</p>
<p>I thought that being able to comment multiple times (insult, counter-insult) would keep the crap in the comments but actual content could surface in the comments. This rule could encourage it to become an actual post. Additionally the counter-counter-whatever will just antagonize people. Maybe when the try to comment again have a message saying “Fight it out on IRC.”.</p>

<p>Yes, and a post is the correct way to do it since you are adding value and not de-railing the thread.</p>
<p>However if you only posted “this is stupid, idiot” that would not be appropriate for a post, so you would use the comment functionality instead.</p>
