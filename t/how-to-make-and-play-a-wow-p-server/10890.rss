Simply press Ctrl+F, this will open the find menu in your browser, now just find the section you&#39;re looking for. Example: You need to find a 1.8 patch quickly so you press Ctrl+F, type A008. since this is the numeric value listed for 1.8 patches and click enter. I hope you like.

--------------------------------------------------

A001. Introduction:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tutorial will attempt to show you how to set up 2 different servers. You can choose which one you like more. This guide will only show how to set a 1.8 private server later or earlier versions are not supported in this tutorial. However I may update the guide later depending upon popularity and understandibility. Let me start off by saying I recommend the Official servers over these private servers. Less gliches, less cheaters and more fun. Though if you&#39;re like me and just can&#39;t play WoW online because of a bad net connection this may be your only choice. I do not condone using private server emulator and I do not recommend it for anyone. The use of this tutorial should only be informative. I do not write this so you can host a server for others but so that you can play singleplayer mode :).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will show you how to set up the following repacks:
UWC 1.3.4 with addon
Mara&#39;s Repack v3.2

A002. A Brief overview of the repacks:
UWC:
I have decided to use this forum for my own personal use. It seems to do what I want it to do and it works well. I have found few gliches and it reminds me alot of the official blizzard servers. I recommend this for the newbies just getting off Official. It takes a little more work to set up yet it&#39;s not hard at all. It takes a little longer to load up but it&#39;s well worth it.

Blizzlike Raiting: 5 Funserver Raiting: 0

Mara&#39;s Repack: (Funserver)
Mara&#39;s Repack was the first I was able to get set up and was impressed with it. It&#39;s a very creative repack and I recommend this for those of you that didn&#39;t find the Official servers fun. There are a couple of nice suprises yet there are a few more gliches than UWC. (I&#39;m still wiating for the next version though :), I don&#39;t doubt it&#39;ll be better than UWC.
Blizzlike Rating: 0 Funserver Raiting: 5

A003. Setting up the Servers:

This section will go indepth in setting up your new server. It has been designed so that even a below average computer user may be able to understand. Over time the tutorial will slowly grow and it will in time maybe become easier to use.

--------------------------------------------------

A004. UWC 1.3.4
You will need the following files please download each.

.Net Framework
http://rapidshare.de/files/15890697/Netframe_2.0.rar.html

1.3.0 Repack
http://rapidshare.de/files/16498217/UWC1.3.0.rar.html

Client Addon v1.1
http://rapidshare.de/files/16492979/UWCAddons1.1.rar.html

v1.3.4 Patch Repack
http://rapidshare.de/files/16514753/UWC1.3.4.rar.html

Setting up the UWC Server: Noob Style

I. Installating .Net Framework:
First thing we have to do is install .Net Framework, this is a very simple installation just click install and let it go, you will not be able to have any web browsers open during the installation so just simply come back after the install.

II. Adding the AddOns and Editing realmlist:
1. Create a folder on your desktop and name it WoW Addons.(we do this for backup reasons.)
2. Go to WoW directory. This can be done one of two ways:
---1. Start-Run-C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft (OK)
---2. If the first way didn&#39;t work you&#39;ll have to locate it manually.
3. Go inside your Interface folder.
4. Select Addons folder and drag it to the folder we created earlier on your desktop.
5. Now we will unzip. Clien Addon v1.1.
6. Open that folder and take the Addon folder and place it in your Interface folder inside the WoW directory.
7. Now go back to the main WoW directory and find the realmlist file. Open it and edit it to say the following set realmlist 127.0.0.1

III. Updating UWC:
1. Unzip both UWC 1.3.4 and UWC 1.3.0.
2. You must now replace the contents of each folder in 1.3.4 with 1.3.0&#39;s: In other words:
You will open 1.3.4 and open the LACD folder, you will then go to your 1.3.0 folder and replace it&#39;s files in LACD with 1.3.4&#39;s.
If you select and drag 1.3.4&#39;s files into 1.3.0&#39;s it ask you if you want to replace the files and select yes, so you don&#39;t have to delete anything.

IV. Editing the Server IP:
1. Open UWC 1.3.0
2. Open wowemu.key
3. Find ws_host:
4. Insert the ip 128.0.0.1, so this should now say: ws_host:127.0.0.1
5. Save and exit.

V. Running the Server and adding an account:
1. Run WE_DK-Core
---It&#39;s very important that you let this program run until you see a message similar to this show up: Completion Port initialized, acceptors=1 workers=1
---This may take a while it can take from 1-2 minutes depending upon your computer. Don&#39;t worry you may think it has frozen after: Loading PP..., but just be patient.
2. Good news: You&#39;re server is now up and running, but we&#39;re not finished yet. Now we have to create your account. There are two circumstances read both of the following and decide which one you need.
---1. You are not currently connected to the internet, you will need to do the following: Start-Run-type
Quote:
cPanel
---2. You are currently connected to the internet, you will need to do the following: Start-Run- type cmd then type ipconfig. You need the first ip that is shown. After you have your ip do the following Start-Run- http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxxx:8080/
3. At the top there is a drop down menu currently selecting Homepage. Select it and select Register a free
4. Enter your desired username and password, then select create.

VI. Giving your account GM powers: (Optional)
1. Now that you have an account, I imagine you want it to be a GM account if so proceed, if not skip this section.
2. Open UWC 1.3.0
3. Open DBUtilEX
4. On the right hand side of the screen click the magnifying glass
5. Select your account
6. In the Account Detail section locate the Player Level option and set it to 6.
7. Click apply and close

VII. Playing on your Server:
1. With your server running open World of Warcraft.
2. Login and play
Note: When you create a character and the game says your character has been created or it says it&#39;s creating your character, click either ok or cancel, then click back and then you may login with your character.

Congratulations!

--------------------------------------------------

A005. Mara&#39;s Repack v3.2

You will need the following files:
Mara&#39;s Repack v3.2:
http://www.uploading.com/?get=AOY8QE4G

Mara&#39;s Addon:
http://www.yourfilelink.com/get.php?fid=92953

Setting up the Mara Repack server: Noob Style

I. Adding the Addons and editing realmlist:
1. Create a folder on your desktop and name it Addons.
2. Locate your WoW Directory.
3. Open the Interface folder inside the WoW Directory.
4. Take the Addons folder and drag it inside the Addons folder we created on your desktop.
5. Unzip AddOnsMaraR file
6. Drag the Addons folder to WoW&#39;s Interface folder.
7. Right click and rename the AddOns folder Addons, so that it&#39;s nice and tidy.
8. Now go back to the main WoW directory and find the realmlist file.
9. Open it and replace the current ip with 127.0.0.1

II. Installing Mara v3.2:
1. Unzip Mara3.2
2. Run the Installation file.
3. The installation is very simple and you&#39;ll get to see the beautiful Mara.
---If you&#39;re running an Anti-Virus you may encounter one problem: A message may pop and say it&#39;s detected Win32-Duella, but as far as I don&#39;t you shouldn&#39;t worry about this. Just click &quot;no action&quot;, &quot;proceed&quot; or &quot;ignore&quot; to continue.

III. Editing the Server IP:
1. Mara has been installed to your Program Files directory, locate it. The folder will be named Mara&#39;s Repack.
2. Inside the directory open the file &quot;wowemu.key&quot;
3. Locate &quot;ws-host=&quot; and edit it to say &quot;ws-host=127.0.0.1&quot;
---Right above this is an option to name the server, the default is Mara&#39;s Server, if you want to rename just erase the words Mara&#39;s Server and insert your server name, though the default works fine.
4. Save and exit.
5. Close the folder and get to your desktop.

IV. Starting the server and adding an account:
1. Mara has added a nice image for our emu so that it&#39;s easy to find. Simply look for the rose. (Thank you Mara.)
2. Start your server by double-clicking the rose.
3. Let the server run until you get a message similar to this one: &quot;Completion Port Initialized, accepts=20 workers=1
---If you proceed to the next step without getting that message, the next steps won&#39;t work. Just be patient. I know it takes a while, and you may think it&#39;s froze but it hasn&#39;t. It can take anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes.
4. Good news, you&#39;re server is now up, but you don&#39;t have an account. We need to create one:
READ CLOSELY:
---1. If you&#39;re connected to the internet do the following: start-run-cmd-ipconfig now that first ip is what you need, copy it somewhere so that you can have it when you need it. Then you need to do the following: start-run-http://(ip):8080
---2. If you&#39;re not connected to the internet do the following: start-run-http://127.0.0.1:8080
5. Now click the drop down menu at the top of the page and select &quot;register a free&quot;
6. Enter your desired username and password and click create.
7. Exit the page.

V. Adding GM powers:
1. With your server running, locate the Mara directory in your program files directory.
2. Find the file &quot;DBUtilEx&quot; and run it.
3. On the right hand side click the magnifying glass.
4. Select the file you want to add GM powers to.
5. On the left hand side under &quot;Account Detail&quot; change Player Level to 6.
6. Click &quot;Apply&quot; and close.


VI. Playing WoW
1. Now it&#39;s time to play, just start WoW and login.
Note: Once you create a character, you will have to click back then you may login with that character. Some reason the game doesn&#39;t change like it should, but it doesn&#39;t matter.
2. Enjoy, and once you get a chance drop by and thank Mara for her hardwork.

Congratulations!

--------------------------------------------------

A006. LAN Server Setup:

What is a LAN?
LAN stands for Local Area Network. A LAN is sort of like internet within a house. You can setup a WoW server or any kind of server and have people play it at your house. So for example, you&#39;ve finally got your WoW server working, but you&#39;re getting a little lonly, big world for just one person huh? So you call over a few friends, setup the LAN and now you can your friends can play together. This is called a LAN Party. A LAN Party is a gaming freak&#39;s weekly highlight.

In order to setup a LAN you must first have setup a server on the desired computer. So go to the top and select a server you&#39;d like to setup UWC 1.3.4 for blizzlikeness and Mara&#39;s Repack v3.2 for just a good time. Then you may proceed here.

1. Locate your servers directory.
2. Locate and open &quot;wowemu.key.&quot;
3. Locate ws-host=127.0.0.1
4. Start-Run-cmd-ipconfig
5. Copy the first ip into your wowemu.key file into &quot;ws-host=&quot;
6. Start up your server.

Note: You shouldn&#39;t have to change your &quot;realmlist.wtf&quot; but if you&#39;re unable to connect, go and change 127.0.0.1 to your IP.

--------------------------------------------------

A007. Online Private Server Setup Guide:

You will need to have previously setup a server. If you have not yet done so please refer to the upper portion of this guide. Setup UWC 1.3.4 for a Blizzlike server or Mara&#39;s Repack v3.2 for a funserver.

1. Find your server directory and open file &quot;wowemu.key&quot;
2. Start-Run-cmd-ipconfig
3. Enter the first IP displaid in cmd window into &quot;wowemu.key&#39;s&quot; &quot;ws-host= section&quot;
4. All those planning to join the server must edit their &quot;realmlist.wtf&quot; inside the WoW directory to that IP

--------------------------------------------------

A008. Downloads:

A009. 1.8 Patches:

PC:
http://www.gamedaily.com/download/info/?packageid=0078700580

Mac:
http://www.strategyinformer.com/pc/worldofwarcraft/patch/2939.html

A010. Frequent Problems:

B001. Unable to Validate Game Version:
B002. I have wrong patch, what do I do?
B003. Unable to Connect:
B003. The server is glichy!
B004. My characters disappear after restarting server!

Problem:
When I try to login it says &quot;unable to validate game version&quot;.
Solution:
It seems you have the wrong patch installed. In order to play UWC you need 1.8.0 patch.

Problem:
I have the wrong patch, what do I do?
Solution:
This depends: Is your patch above the server requirement or below?
1. If it&#39;s below, all you must do is find the patch. For instance you have 1.5.0 and you need 1.8.0, simply do a google search for WoW 1.8.0 patch, download and install.
2. If it&#39;s above, you have two choices.
---1. Reinstall WoW, this takes a very long time!
---2. Downgrade the patch, do the following: find your WoW Directory, delete the following: Folders: WDT and WTF and delete WoW.exe and Patch.mpq if you have one. Then you must run the repair.exe. If you can&#39;t find this file then go to Google and search for Blizzard WoW repair.exe, you should be able to find a link to the file from worldofwarcraft.com the official wow site. Once this is done the game will now be patch 1.0.0, so now all you have to do is google WoW 1.8 patch and download and install.

Problem:
When I try to login it says &quot;unable to connect.&quot;
Solution:
It seems that you do not have the realmlist or the wowemu.key set right. Make sure both are set to 127.0.0.1 The reason for this is that even if your computers IP isn&#39;t currently 127.0.0.1 WoW will still connect, because it&#39;s all on the same computer. 127.0.0.1 tells the computer that it&#39;s local, so WoW isn&#39;t looking for your ip, it&#39;s looking for the local server. It could also be that you didn&#39;t wait and let the server load like you should have, make sure the last message on the server was something like: Completion Port initialized, acceptors=1 workers=1 The server is not connected until you get a similar message, so if you try and connect before you get this message WoW won&#39;t be able to find the server.

Problem:
The server is glichy.
Solution:
There is no solution. All the servers are going to be a little glichy. Sometimes come to goat spirit&#39;s forums and search for the current problem you&#39;re having, there&#39;s a good chance someone else has already had the same problem. So just read their fix.

Problem:
My characters are gone after I restart the server! What happened?
Solution:
Every now and then your server will initiate a world save. What this does is saves all the current settings in the world, including your character. Now sometimes you won&#39;t be on long enough for the world save to occur, and in some emu&#39;s the world save will never occur so you must do this manually. There are one of two ways to save your settings so that they will be there for your next login.
---1. type .save (your password) This will iniate the world save and voila your character is saved.
Note: In order to use .save (password) you must be a GM in other words your Player Level must be set to 6.
---2. when you are done playing go to your server and type x . This will iniate a world save and close the server.
