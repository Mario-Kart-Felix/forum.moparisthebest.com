    <title>::vote command [delta]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vote-command-delta/366064</link>
    <description>i saw the tutorial for vote commands for pi, so i tought id try to convert them to delta but all i got was errors :o

so, i need an idea of how the commands should look like.

1. ::vote for players to enter and the votepage will pop up
2. ::voteall for owner(s) that will open up the votepage for all online players</description>
