client.java:12: error: package Clansystem does not exist
import Clansystem.Clanroomcheck;
                 ^
1 error
Press any key to continue . . .

What do I do? I try adding things... when I compile It says this and after I run the source, and run my client, and nothing gets added please need some help and here is what my compiler looks like when you right click and edit. I just started programming, I know I guess I have to import the Clansystem.Clanromcheck; like it says but im not understand where it is, or how to do it lol. Im new at programming but it seems fun trying to learn :)
Is my compiler edit right as well?

              <p>I’m using Delta but never mind I fixed the problem, and the problem was- It didn’t have the other half of the clan source thingy lol and the only way was to either get all of it then import it with game handler or delete the whole line and thats what I did because i had to hurry and fix like 5 things but thats like 5/5000 things I have to fix lol but are you good or pretty good at programming?</p>
