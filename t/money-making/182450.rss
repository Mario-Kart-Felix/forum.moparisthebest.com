    <description>If you need information on my stats, let me know.

I am looking for a way to make about 60m gold in less than a month. I have researched many different money making techiniques and tried a few out. These include the following:

barrows
metal dragon hunting
treasure trails
battlestaff making

Barrows has always been good to me. I have made an easy 5m in a week through that. However, it is not enough.

Metal dragon hunting has been alright as well, but just alright. I believe the ratio for a d leg or skirt drop is around 1/600, and for their prices that just doesn&#39;t cut it at my level (102 combat - summoning = 100 combat).

I have barely made over 1.5m on treasure trails through 3 or 4 scrolls (level 3&#39;s obviously.) One three takes about an hour and a half to get and solve, but around five to get decent money. A third age item is incredibly rare from these scrolls, so I really do not know if this is the way to go.

Battlestaff making has been ruined when Jagex updated varrock and made the &quot;buy-battlestaff&quot; option for zaff. So, this is definitely not an option.

Other money makers I thought of were runecrafting (zmi or plain nat making [52 rc]), and the woodcutting-fletching-alching field. Well, the former is very slow unless you can make double natures and the latter is barely effective in a goal of 60m. I can do 100k yews which will practically get my woodcutting to 99 (currently 75), my fletching to 99 (currently 81), and my magic to 99 (currently 75), or at least close. 100k in this would give me about 30m profit, and would take many months.

Fishing is another assumed possibility, but no one I would like to go in. As it is, like woodcutting, very slow. As is the mining possibility.


The reason I need 60m is because I am going for 90 construction and a 27 room house. My budget for this project is 58,873,879 gold or 58.9 million. Any help with making extremely fast money would be HIGHLY appreciated.

BTW, hunter is not an option. I personally dislike the skill and 30m in three to four weeks does not seem appealing to me either.=.</description>

<p>No, it isn’t. It is based on a ratio. This is a boolean:</p>
<p>0, 1</p>
<p>You have a 50% chance of getting a 0 the first time and 50% the second time. The <span class="bbcode-i">chance</span> never changes. However, if you get a 0 the first time, the ratio will shift from 1:2 to a 1:1, theoretically making it a 99% <span class="bbcode-i">chance</span> to get a 1 the second time. This is how mathematical random theorems work. They are based upon the current time (sometimes down the the millisecond and because time is never the same) and the current date which are used as parameters in an algorithm that returns a certain value. Now, from here on out I am assuming Jagex’s server returns the number of the drop item depending on what the random is. In this case, you have a high chance of getting a less rare item because it probably returns the number representing that item more times then it does for the rarer item.</p>
<p>To sum it up, you always have the same chance to get the drop. However, the ratio will be theoretically reduced as you kill more because you are calling on that algorithm over and over again. This is why luck does not exist on a machine, because random does not exist at all. It is a theory based on the only ever-changing number, time.</p>

<p>I just did several blocks to get to 74. Trust me, this is one skill I will not give up on easily. This is my way of thinking:</p>
<p>RuneScape is just a game. Construction is one of the few things that I have ever enjoyed in that game. Why I care about savoring my money is now incomprehensible… So, I decided to work for money to do construction, thus, making RuneScape actually fun for me.</p>

</aside>
<p>Not entirely trying to doubt, but your friend is defying the laws of the runescape server and, in essence, is talking utter bullshit. It is impossible to defy the mathematical rounding functions which will return the required drop number extremely rare. When someone says you need 8000 kills for a dragon chain on dust devils, you will HAVE to make that math function be called 7000-9000 times to balance out the average and get that one return number. 3 visages and 9 d drops in 100 kills is impossible. Oh, and luck does not exist on a computer. It is a boolean- true or false in all instances.</p>
<p>Sorry for contradicting everyone, but I am ruling out everything that doesn’t seem within reach. It is possible to get 60m in four weeks and I want to find out the method. I am asking for all help and am thankful for those who have already contributed.</p>

<p>For tracking reasons, I’d rather not post them. And, 100k yews is only 30-40m. I need 60m in one month because I do not want to wait forever. RuneScape sucks just because it absorbs all your time just so that you can be somewhat sufficient in the game…</p>

              <p>I don’t see how you can make that much money so fast any more. What happens in a month? Why does it have to be one month. If you do the 100k yews it will probably take you at least 50 days - if you can cut 2k per day that is.</p>

<p>How much is your budget to make 60m? in my opinion i would kill mith dragons… if you have around 10m you could kill a decent ammount of mith drags and if you get lucky there is 50m with a dragon full helm drop… So far i have killed around 150 and used around 500k. (i died 12 times going afk though)</p>

<p>My budget is around 8m. And do you have any ideas on the ratio to get a dragon full helm?</p>
<p>Also, you can get a dragon full helm through the pyres up there, but I would imagine it is extremely rare.</p>

              <p>If you need information on my stats, let me know.</p>
<p>I am looking for a way to make about 60m gold in less than a month. I have researched many different money making techiniques and tried a few out. These include the following:</p>
<p>barrows<br>
metal dragon hunting<br>
treasure trails<br>
battlestaff making</p>
<p>Barrows has always been good to me. I have made an easy 5m in a week through that. However, it is not enough.</p>
<p>Metal dragon hunting has been alright as well, but just alright. I believe the ratio for a d leg or skirt drop is around 1/600, and for their prices that just doesn’t cut it at my level (102 combat - summoning = 100 combat).</p>
<p>I have barely made over 1.5m on treasure trails through 3 or 4 scrolls (level 3’s obviously.) One three takes about an hour and a half to get and solve, but around five to get decent money. A third age item is incredibly rare from these scrolls, so I really do not know if this is the way to go.</p>
<p>Battlestaff making has been ruined when Jagex updated varrock and made the “buy-battlestaff” option for zaff. So, this is definitely not an option.</p>
<p>Other money makers I thought of were runecrafting (zmi or plain nat making [52 rc]), and the woodcutting-fletching-alching field. Well, the former is very slow unless you can make double natures and the latter is barely effective in a goal of 60m. I can do 100k yews which will practically get my woodcutting to 99 (currently 75), my fletching to 99 (currently 81), and my magic to 99 (currently 75), or at least close. 100k in this would give me about 30m profit, and would take many months.</p>
<p>Fishing is another assumed possibility, but no one I would like to go in. As it is, like woodcutting, very slow. As is the mining possibility.</p>
<p>The reason I need 60m is because I am going for 90 construction and a 27 room house. My budget for this project is 58,873,879 gold or 58.9 million. Any help with making extremely fast money would be HIGHLY appreciated.</p>
<p>BTW, hunter is not an option. I personally dislike the skill and 30m in three to four weeks does not seem appealing to me either.=.</p>
