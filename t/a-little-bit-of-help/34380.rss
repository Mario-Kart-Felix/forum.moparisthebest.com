              <p>Thumbnails… I use a simply code for using gallerys like this, help this helps you:</p>
<p><a>&lt;img src=“image source” width=“75”, height=“75”&gt;</a></p>
<p>This basically pits an image on the page which is 75x75 (width=“75”, height=“75”) and once the image is clicked a popup will come up with the image at its full size, 150x125 (width=150, height=125). Only thing I found annoying with this was the “image name” at the start must be in the same directory as the page.</p>
