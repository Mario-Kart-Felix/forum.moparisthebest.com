    <title>[562] Client Help - Rep++ For Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/562-client-help-rep-for-help/370663</link>
    <description>Hello, I&#39;m having trouble with my, and [b]several[/b] other 562 Clients. I know for sure it&#39;s not the server, it&#39;s indeed the client because I tried three different servers using each of the clients I have on each of them.

The problem is, 9 out of every 10 times I try to connect to the server using a 562 Client, it says &quot;Error_Game_JS5Connect&quot;, and the other time it connects (The 1 out of 10). So I know it&#39;s not the Cache because it still connects. How can I prevent the Client from having to load [b]So many[/b] times before it actually connecting? How can I make it connect, straight to the server without this error the [b]First[/b] time I try?

I&#39;ll Rep++ For [b]Help[/b] on fixing this error or if you have a Link to a 562 Client, because I constantly use the search button and no clients I found have this error fixed.</description>

<p>The “error_game_js5connect” error is something to do with not having the server running before executing the client. Just to clarify; 9 times out of 10 do you run the client first?</p>
