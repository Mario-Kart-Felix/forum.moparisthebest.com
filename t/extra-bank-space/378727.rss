    <title>Extra Bank Space?</title>

I do not know whether it is client side or server side, my idea on server side didn&#39;t work so my guess it is client side....

Well on my custom bank interface i noticed extra space. I thought increasing the bank space would make the space worth something but it doesn&#39;t work... completely. I add an item into the &quot;extra space&quot; and it is not visible, nor can you take it out, basically its stuck there until removing it by editing the character file.

well, think this &quot;extra space&quot; can be worth something if you could fill it in, care to help?
if necessary ill post what is needed on here.</description>
