It doesn’t really matter.  This site and every other RSPS community wants everything handed to them.  The people handing it to them do it the easiest and probably the shittiest way possible.  Yz’s base is more complicated than Pali’s.  So even though Yz’s is much more stable, there all going to go with Pali’s.<br>
[/quote]<br>
My base isn’t complicated, it has everything done for them by MINA, all I did really was attach a few codecs and add an auto-loading packet handling feature :P[/quote]<br>
They’re still not going to take the time to learn how to use it.</p>

Thats worse than the Tutorial Section! Every post there is locked! I think the Seciotn needs to be removed because people dont use Moparscapes Client anymore and theres no indication MITB will make another one.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2008/4/1/1847192/retaards.PNG" alt width="" height="">[/quote]</p>
<p>the topics in tut section are locked because most of it is common sence and c&amp;p tuts.</p>
<p>people cry about their topics being locked when all it is, is a c&amp;p tut from someone who possibly posted something like yours a few years ago when people can just look through the threads anyway.</p>
<p>people who are just starting are asking some really stupid questions at first because they havn’t even boved to look through tuts and use the search bar befor asking their questions.</p>

<p>It’s not organization that’s the problem. The problem is the motive behind working. These members will go to almost any length to get their server out there and thus become popular. To create the best forum possible, all you have to do is control the advertisement of the members as well as the code they are using. It is already too late for this community because it is filled with code and sources all derived from the winterlove crap source. There is not much we can do here other than promote a stable server and hope for the best.</p>

<p>I support this idea, just not in this community. This community is by far too immature to be given any power whatsoever, as they cannot display any self-control when it comes to post obnoxious and stupid topics. On top of that, members could lock important topics that were stickied. They could also play a lock-unlock game with a moderator, though I believe SMF has the lock feature be based upon the hierarchical standing of the user.</p>

<p>Just as I thought. But still, there are a number of things a person can do to abuse a simple right as being able to lock their own topic. This is not what we want to happen. If a user simply states in their topic that they want it locked, then a moderator will lock or remove it, no questions act. It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>As I said in the other topic, if and of you had any idea how much work Moparscape requires to manage, you would not be saying we are inactive at all. And generally, as times get tougher the activity of moderators drops. It will spike soon, as there are some suggestions being passed around with what to do with Moparscape in its current state. Just be patient while some mandatory decisions are made and then executed. Hopefully, a few things will change around here to benefit everyone.</p>

It was a little too much to take as a matter of fact. Perhaps you know what I’m talking about? Either way, as long as mscp is in it’s best state, I’m happy. It’s just aggravating to see the degrasion of moparscape. But as you’ve said before, we always get those spikes in mod activities to save us at the last minute. It would be nice though, to have that spike last longer than a few weeks to a month though. =\</p>

As I said in the other topic, if and of you had any idea how much work Moparscape requires to manage, you would not be saying we are inactive at all. And generally, as times get tougher the activity of moderators drops. It will spike soon, as there are some suggestions being passed around with what to do with Moparscape in its current state. Just be patient while some mandatory decisions are made and then executed. Hopefully, a few things will change around here to benefit everyone.<br>
[/quote]I clearly remember the comebacks actually. It was a little too much to take as a matter of fact. Perhaps you know what I’m talking about? Either way, as long as mscp is in it’s best state, I’m happy. It’s just aggravating to see the degrasion of moparscape. But as you’ve said before, we always get those spikes in mod activities to save us at the last minute. It would be nice though, to have that spike last longer than a few weeks to a month though. =[/quote]<br>
I have quite a little bit of a egotistical thing to say about myself, so I’ll say it upfront: I was always active, I moderated every day the same. Now, now that I have said that, I didn’t mean to say the moderators do a bad job, or any other thing the staff may perceive.</p>
<p>The spikes usually happen when a person is appointed moderator, i.e Hasumon/m.dog311’s activity, it was all at the start of their moderater appointment.</p>

<p>Shouldn’t members be allowed to lock their own topic after it is answered? Some people may not, but others will. This would probably save a little bit of work for the mods also.</p>

</aside>
<p>I support this idea, just not in this community. This community is by far too immature to be given any power whatsoever, as they cannot display any self-control when it comes to post obnoxious and stupid topics. On top of that, members could lock important topics that were stickied. They could also play a lock-unlock game with a moderator, though I believe SMF has the lock feature be based upon the hierarchical standing of the user.</p>

</aside>
<p>No if the thread is locked by a mod, a regular member cannot unlock it.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Just as I thought. But still, there are a number of things a person can do to abuse a simple right as being able to lock their own topic. This is not what we want to happen. If a user simply states in their topic that they want it locked, then a moderator will lock or remove it, no questions act. It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>Along with the Help section, as it would keep people from referring to MoparScape as a bad community from the amount of idiotic topics.<br>
[/quote]True, we should focus on cleaning out the community a little bit. Everyone talks about how ignorant and ‘stupid’ our members are, especially the staff, yet we can’t even keep our sections and boards cleaned. I suppose this just leads to lack of mod activity.</p>

<p>You shouldn’t be totally pessimistic about that. This forum <span class="bbcode-i">has</span> changed a hell of a lot since I joined. We both joined two days apart, so you should have seen the change as well as I have. This website was an utter shithole when I first became a moderator, and soon after Mopar made the MoparScape mod position, everything started turning around. Though, even with the drop in activity (I’m guessing a good 15-20%), the site has turned around and is pointing toward the future. With some prodding and encouragement, I’m sure we could get this entire community to start using some base that actually works and will benefit the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Hell, not a bad idea in my opinion. The only troublesome part about it is managing it. Spamming can easily be prevented and all, but you are talking about a ton of work for something so simple. I don’t doubt that it would be used <span class="bbcode-i">sometimes</span> to help people, but what will probably happen is the more learned people of the community will just sit on there on chat, while people on Mitb come on there and bring them down. The people who actually need help will rarely come on, as they have already proven that they are unable to even read stickied topics.</p>

<p>Didn’t Speljohan put one up a while back for mitb? I never really found out if that went well or not. Not many people use Vent I guess because there’s other more “user-friendly” things out there like Skype and that “Windows Live Call” service that’s now included in the wLinstaller if you download the windows live package like fags like me do.</p>
