I try to help people, and I expect them to try to learn. When a question is asked in the help section, I post an answer and the person that asked the question implements my code into his/her server. Although I am helping them, it’s not good for them, due to the fact that they do not try to learn from it. The only reason most people post is to either fix errors on their server or try to enhance their server. They do not ask questions, then actually question the information.</p>

<p>people ardly learn when they try to make threads anyway.</p>
<p>we both actually try to help others, but not food feed the answer to them.</p>
<p>if they still do not understand what i say/we say, then they should go learn abit more java befor reposting again. it is very irratating when people make a thread, then it goes off the first page, so they decide to make another thread about it when actually no one knows the answer or it is in the site somewhere.</p>

It would make it a lot easier to let mods know what they’re looking for in the post. I can only imagine how misleading some reports can be; and if they aren’t, this could only improve the convenience.</p>

<p>My dear Razor! You have claimed to know private servers and Java-related knowledge throughout this topic, yet you still let that post be shown! As you well know, RS2D is quite blank. I have personally mingled with the RS protocol and have added many content systems to an RS2D copy, just for the 317 client. I spent many, many hard hours developing all of the content systems to develop one single core, prior to any content being added at all. My point is, rebuilding RS2D to match the standards that current private servers show today is futile. No one here has the will to actually finish such a hard project, and very few even have the knowledge to. Though removing the winterlove standard from this website seems like an incredible dream, the dream has become impossible.</p>

Eh, I’d say if someone (Maybe I will when I’m done writing my forum software) got Kyle’s 317Serv to combat, banking, items, and crap people would use it. It’s just they really don’t have anything, so people are afraid to start. But, as you said not many people have the knowledge to do so. I might if I have spare time after getting my forum software to a usable point.</p>
