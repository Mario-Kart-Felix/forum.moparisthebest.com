<p>You can do that in runescape discussion providing that you’re giving it away, and not asking something for it.</p>

I will not give up until we get what we want!</p>
<p>I still think a console gaming board would be a good idea, well since rsps isn’t going anywhere for sometime we need something to keep us company. MITB’s gaming board isn’t enough, remember MPSCP and MITB are no longer one forum, so why can they have a gaming board and we cant?</p>

Well a lot of the people here either play PS3 or Xbox 360 so maybe we could have a board/section for console gaming? I’d really like that, what about everyone else?<br>

<p>A new section (With the subjects posted in it that I specified in my above post) will encourage others to “game” more; it could help people find the right game/console/computer components to optimize their gaming experience.</p>

              <p>I agree with the idea of a gaming board since I play games both on my PC and my Xbox, quite often.</p>
<p>There are both pros and cons to the idea:</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Pros:</span></span></p>
<p>[ul][li]People who use this forum generally are gamers and have pretty decent PCs.[/li]<br>
[li]Ways of obtaining games can be discussed/made into tutorials (E.g, torrenting, warez etc.).[/li]<br>
[li]Users could post links to decent games to download/buy.[/li]<br>
[li]Several sub-sections could be made, such as reviews, the technical side to gaming and others.[/li]<br>
[li]A gaming board can also introduce a small computing side to it, for the PC gamers, where computing components to help run games faster can be discussed etc (I am aware that there’s a board for this on MITB, however most Moparscapers would most likely be shit upon by the people of the MITB side).[/li][/ul]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-u"><span class="bbcode-b">Cons:</span></span></p>
<p>[ul][li]Posting torrent/warez links is illegal in most countries, therefore there may be legality issues that may crop up with the forum (I doubt anyone cares about this anyway).[/li]<br>
[li]As some of the above people have said, there aren’t many topics about gaming (However there are quite a few topics about individual games that people want opinions on etc).[/li][/ul]</p>
<p>There are probably more, those are just the ones that I can think of.</p>

Well a lot of the people here either play PS3 or Xbox 360 so maybe we could have a board/section for console gaming? I’d really like that, what about everyone else?<br>
[/quote]I disagree.</p>
<ol>
<li>We don’t have enough content of console gaming worth making a new board for it</li>
<li>This site is for RSPS and things related to it (RuneScape, Programming etc), and things like consoles could be posted on MITB</li>
<li>We have a general discussion board, which can accommodate all of the console gaming threads (of which there is a total of what, like 5?)[/quote]</li>
<li>Console gaming isn’t only PS3 and XBox 360, so you’re wrong there.</li>
<li>That is an invalid argument; an RSPS site does not <span class="bbcode-b">have</span> to be 100% related to RSPS, so you’re wrong there.</li>
<li>As I said, there are more than 2 gaming consoles, if you knew that, so there will be more than ‘5’ threads, so you’re wrong there again.</li>
</ol>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tabby">@Tabby</a>: I agree also.</p>
