<p>Adding onto that, there is a green and red system. Once you report a topic, what jme said happens. The thread is marked red by default. When the thread is fixed, deleted, locked, etc. we mark it green, meaning fulfilled. We had actually been many pages behind of red topics, but the section was cleaned and we are now completely green.</p>

Though MoparScape is doing better than before, it still has problems that the whole community needs to overcome, and work together to fix. Chassy13 has done a phenomenal job as moderator since his recent promotion, but one user cannot change the whole website alone. I believe that more moderators, referring to Taharok, M.dog, Scarecrows, and Chassy, would truly benefit this community.<br>
[/quote]<br>
I agree. Chassy13 is doing a great job, but no person can look after the entire forums constantly on their own.[/quote]I feel like a yesman just agreeing but it is true. As time passes, it’s usually only one mod online throughout the day. Now statistically we could say there are two or three mods on some of the time, but not most of the time. I over the summer the forum was surrounded by Ego-Kings and “revolutionists” constantly making these rebellious posts, posts that would stick out of context, or just completely focused on their own popularity. I looked up to all of them because of that specific reason. Now that i think about it, I realize the mods that would constantly lock, and deal with these sort of people are easily more valuable than some members looking for a little attention. As a <span class="bbcode-i">team</span> they took out nearly every single post moderately, not frantically, but moderately. That’s what I want to see again, that’s what I look up to. One is nothing without the rest.</p>

<p>to add onto that, i see that players advertising other forums/servers only get a current warning and a lock of thread.<br>
now in this case, i think its pritty pointless.</p>
<ol>
<li>people can still look on the site.</li>
<li>a warning does shit nothing because they continue.</li>
</ol>
<p>i think to rest all these advertisements, make harsher punishments. such as a ban, i think a ban would go well because they cannot post again. even if they are moderated or muted, im sure they will wait or get a mate to carry on advertising.<br>
moderators also only lock the threads. sometimes, they dont even bover to edit the topic so there is still sites in the topic. i think moderators can do alot better job if they did things differently and moparisthebest changed some rules to harsher punishments. you may think its to much, but when it actually comes to it, it isnt.</p>

<p>I agree about just locking it and not editing out the website. I make sure to do it, I thought other mods were too but I never noticed. I’m not sure but maybe regular moparscape mods can’t edit posts, it might just be senior mods+ - If this is the case, I think we need to give them that power.</p>
<p>If you see any like that feel free to notify me of them and I’ll make sure it gets edited out, and they receive proper punishment and their website is added to the filter list.</p>

<p>Though MoparScape is doing better than before, it still has problems that the whole community needs to overcome, and work together to fix. Chassy13 has done a phenomenal job as moderator since his recent promotion, but one user cannot change the whole website alone. I believe that more moderators, referring to Taharok, M.dog, Scarecrows, and Chassy, would truly benefit this community.</p>

</aside>
<p>I agree. Chassy13 is doing a great job, but no person can look after the entire forums constantly on their own.<br>
[/quote]I feel like a yesman just agreeing but it is true. As time passes, it’s usually only one mod online throughout the day. Now statistically we could say there are two or three mods on some of the time, but not most of the time. I over the summer the forum was surrounded by Ego-Kings and “revolutionists” constantly making these rebellious posts, posts that would stick out of context, or just completely focused on their own popularity. I looked up to all of them because of that specific reason. Now that i think about it, I realize the mods that would constantly lock, and deal with these sort of people are easily more valuable than some members looking for a little attention.

<p>Warnings are for the first infraction. If they continue, they are moderated or muted based on the instance. If breaking this rule continually happens, they are then banned permanently. You would not know that, though, because you wouldn’t ever see who was banned.</p>

        <p>[quote=“Chassy13, post:497, topic:248368”]Why would you move a post? I can understand threads, but almost every update comes with problems or abuse. We have suggested members locking their own topics, but it was turned down.[/quote]Seems that members seem to want to make life hard for themselves, couldn’t you work around this? For Example allow trusted members of the community to do this?<br>
In answer to “why would you want to move a post” It would give users a chance to move their post if it was to go somewere it shouldn’t, kind of like a verbal warning by moderators, before a punishment was enforced.</p>

        <p>A punishment really isn’t enforced for posting in the wrong section. We move the topic, and forget about it. It takes around 3-4 clicks and about 5 seconds to do this process.</p>
