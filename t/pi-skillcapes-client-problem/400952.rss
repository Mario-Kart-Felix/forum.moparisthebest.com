    <description>Hi.

I&#39;d like to know what&#39;s wrong with clicking on the Wise old man in project insanity. I&#39;ll tell you all what I know, hopefully someone can get me some help.
The first thing commented out is the skillcapes. This piece of code is the display in this &quot;custom shop&quot;. Showing the slot and cape. 

When I have enough coins to buy the skillcapes in my inventory, for some reason the client freezes. But when I have no coins, I am able to open the shop by clicking on the wise old man and view all the skillcapes in my client no problem.

On an account with only a few 99s, I am able to have enough coins in my inventory while opening the shop and have it not freeze, but I can not buy a skillcape anyway. 

In the code it says it opens up &quot;shop 14&quot;. I checked shops.cfg and shop 14 was not coded.

I may just be making a very easy-to-fix mistake, but here&#39;s the code found in ShopAssistant.java.

What I personally think is that having item 995 in my inventory, it adds a certain model to the shop for a cape (Which one?) (Why?) that I can&#39;t view. I have tried spawning all the capes in the code and none of them made me crash.

EDIT1: I was right! I tried having 1 99 at a time to see which cape crashed me with item 995 (coins) in my inventory. It seem as thought just having coins in my inventory was able to put a item in the shop named &quot;bagged nice tree&quot;. I am now going to find the item ID and search the code for it to see why it comes up.
