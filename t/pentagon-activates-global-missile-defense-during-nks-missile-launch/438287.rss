    <title>Pentagon activates global missile defense during NK&#39;s missile launch</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pentagon-activates-global-missile-defense-during-nks-missile-launch/438287</link>
    <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;The Pentagon recently activated its global missile shield in anticipation of North Korea’s launch of a long-range missile, according to defense officials.

The measures include stepped-up electronic monitoring, deployment of missile interceptor ships, and activation of radar networks to areas near the Korean peninsula and western Pacific.

Three interceptor ships near Japan and the Philippines, as well as U.S.-based interceptors, are ready to shoot down the North Korean missile if space-, land-, and sea-based sensors determine its flight path is targeted at the United States or U.S. allies, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Obama administration will regard any launch by North Korea as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions regardless of whether the North Koreans claim the rocket test is for space launch purposes, the officials said. The technology and rocketry used for a space launch is nearly identical to that used with ballistic missiles that carry a warhead, they said.

Also, because the payload or warhead of the test launch cannot be determined prior to launch, the Obama administration decided to activate the missile defense system.

According to U.S. officials, current intelligence assessments indicate the North Korean missile will be launched from a base called Tongchang-ri, located on a west coast peninsula north of Pyongyang between April 12 and April 15.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<p>I see North Korea as a threat but I don’t see why the United States needs to become involved with this more than they have too, the Japanese already have their own AEGIS based missile defense systems and they were already more than prepared to take action after the failed 2009 missile tests and I am sure the surrounding countries have a variety of other missile defense systems (supplies by the US). I think its fine that we supply our allies with these systems (as long as they are paying for them) and I think it would be appropriate for any of these countries to shot down a rocket fired by North Korea if it begins to get close enough that a nuclear payload would effect that country. I don’t see how North Korea would be dumb enough to try anything considering they are a pimple on the ass of the earth and the United States and its allies have more than enough weapon systems to level their country if they ever declared war or tried to attack us. The US should take action if the missile is headed on a trajectory that specifically targets us, otherwise other countries are than equipped and ready to take care of this if it targets them. It seems like every time the US gets asked to help out in something like this we end up taking the blame when all is fucked. IE Brits ask US to help them overthrow Mosaddegh and now 60 years later Europe blames us for everything happening in the middle east when they were involved in the same exact shit</p>

<p>Whilst I don’t like the idea of civilians dying of starvation if its required to start a revolution it might be the only way. I doubt very much the people were told it came from America if they did receive it, and thus their faith in their dictators is restored IF they did receive a bucket load of food (as obviously they will take credit for it). Arguably doing more harm than good by strengthening the leaders pull over the people further.</p>

<p>It’s meant to land just before Australia. The problem is, we have no idea what the payload of this is. So America has positioned itself to shoot it down. As has Japan. North Korea claims it’s just a satellite but chances are, it’s a long-ranged test. North Korea signed an agreement not to test these. American food supplies to the North Korean people have now been stopped.</p>

<p>The measures include stepped-up electronic monitoring, deployment of missile interceptor ships, and activation of radar networks to areas near the Korean peninsula and western Pacific.</p>
<p>Three interceptor ships near Japan and the Philippines, as well as U.S.-based interceptors, are ready to shoot down the North Korean missile if space-, land-, and sea-based sensors determine its flight path is targeted at the United States or U.S. allies, said officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The Obama administration will regard any launch by North Korea as a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions regardless of whether the North Koreans claim the rocket test is for space launch purposes, the officials said. The technology and rocketry used for a space launch is nearly identical to that used with ballistic missiles that carry a warhead, they said.</p>
<p>Also, because the payload or warhead of the test launch cannot be determined prior to launch, the Obama administration decided to activate the missile defense system.</p>
<p>According to U.S. officials, current intelligence assessments indicate the North Korean missile will be launched from a base called Tongchang-ri, located on a west coast peninsula north of Pyongyang between April 12 and April 15.</p>
