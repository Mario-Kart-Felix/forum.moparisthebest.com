    <title>[317] [PI] Summoning Pouch/Scroll Creation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-pi-summoning-pouch-scroll-creation/551773</link>
    <description>So I have been working on my project for awhile now and I decided to try and add summoning. I started trying with the interface but that didn&#39;t work out because the pouch icons were not showing up so I tried going around that and doing it via dialoguehandler and clicking buttons (kinda dumb I know). I have all the pouches with the options and actions set up but I don&#39;t know how to make it so when you click the option, it checks your inventory for the items and if you have the items, make the pouch.

Example -

[IMG]http://i61.tinypic.com/1073oll.png[/img]
Player clicks &quot;Lava titan pouch&quot;

If the player has &quot;1 blue charm, 1 obsidian charm, 219 shards, and 1 pouch&quot; then make the pouch and remove the items
If the player does not have those items, close all windows and output &quot;You need 1 blue charm, 1 obsidian charm, 219 shards, and 1 pouch to make this pouch&quot;

I have been over this and thought about it multiple times, but I have no idea how to check for this and then make the pouch accordingly.
Can someone put me in the right direction?</description>

              <p>I’m trying to complete summoning on my server and I’m almost done except for this one small part. I want to make scroll creation, but I need an easier way.</p>
<p>I started off storing all the information like this:</p>
<p><code>public static final String[][] summoningPouchData = {
			// Pouch id, pouch charm, item1, Shardamount, LVL, Spec scroll
			{ "Spirit wolf pouch", "Gold Charm", "Wolf bones", "7", "1",
					"Howl scroll", "5" },
			{ "Dreadfowl pouch", "Gold Charm", "Raw chicken", "8", "4",
					"Dreadfowl strike scroll", "9" },</code><br>
The list is complete, but I’m only showing two for an example. I want to make it so when you use a certain pouch on the npc, it creates the scrolls according to what pouch you use.<br>
I was thinking somewhere along the lines of storing all the pouch id’s in an enum, but then after that part, I don’t know where to go. Can someone help?</p>

<p>There are much better ways you can check items and etc, but that is just an example.</p>
<p>One way you could do this is store all the summoning data into something like an enum. Store how many pouches are needed, charms, and etc.<br>
Then, in your summoning class, create an array of integers that are used for the dialogue ids…<br>
Now, create a method that requires the dialogue id and the action button id as parameters.<br>
First, you need to check if the dialogue id is the correct. so create a for loop to check that.<br>
Second, you will need to grab the summoning data based on the action button clicked and dialogue id… This is going to be handled in a second method that returns the summoning object (or null if none).<br>
Third, you need to check if the player has all the items… It’d be similar to how I showed above, but instead of specifying specific IDs, you’d just use the values from the summoning data.<br>
Fourth, check the player level.<br>
If all that’s good, delete the items, give the player the items, and give them exp.</p>
