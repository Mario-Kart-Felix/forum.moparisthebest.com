    <title>[317]Map/Coord Validation</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-map-coord-validation/551706</link>
    <description>What&#39;s the correct way to validate maps in Runescape? I mean like, if a specific coord is valid or not.
Do I need to initialize some map file and analyze it for coords or has no private server implemented validation for movement?

I am writing my own custom source from scratch, so I just need some hint in what direction I&#39;d have to go in order to validate map coords.

I am at the point of writing the player update handler and having maps solved is essential before anything else.

If you need any type of code or information please let me know.

Also what is the specific routine of searching for a walking path and how does it exactly work?
The wiki is a bit confusing for the whole player updating process.</description>

Sounds like you’re looking for <a href="https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php?topic=527173.0" data-bbcode="true">Server Sided Clipping</a>. You can use that data (The links are dead, search the topic for my reply as I supplied new links somewhere) to verify what objects exist on coords, if any.</p>
<p>The server doesn’t actually do much coordinate validation (In terms of if the player can walk to a space or not), as the client typically is in control of that. Server sided clipping is generally an essential if you want to add clipped combat and following, though.<br>

<p>Strange cuz you should never trust the client. Thanks a lot though will take a look[/quote]</p>
<p>The first line of defense is usually on the client side. As you can tell, it’s fragile. That’s why, to ensure players don’t go out of bounds, you do it on the server too.</p>
<p>Granted, and this is a bit off-topic, there are additional ways to detect players doing this. You could implement a client-side getLocation() packet, you could do hash checking on the files on the client and if there are any different, get the latest from your server. Someone could also hook into the client and transform it at runtime using bcel or asm or something similar though. Detecting that would be a bit harder, but would still be trumped by the server side clipping.</p>
<p>This still wouldn’t prevent someone from changing the protocol and not sending player update packets all of the time, and allow the player to move on the client side. At that point though there’s not much you can do.</p>
