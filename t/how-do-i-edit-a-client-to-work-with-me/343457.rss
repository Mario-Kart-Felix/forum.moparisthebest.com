    <title>How do I edit a client to work with me?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-do-i-edit-a-client-to-work-with-me/343457</link>
    <description>I downloaded the Unholy Blitz client and server. I don&#39;t know how to edit the client to work with my server? I know you have to change files but which ones? Also, I want to edit my Server to say Ps3 Scape instead of Blitz or whatever. Can someone please help or get on Teamviewer and show?</description>

And to make it say your server name you have to go into client.java and depending on the client version there in diffrent places.  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/cool.png?v=5" title=":cool:" class="emoji" alt=":cool:"></p>
