    <description>Okay.. For all you experts, I need help in starting to make a server and finishing it. I need help on fixing all the items, hosting, and all the other important stuff. I need someone who can help me through creating the server. I need to know how much money i need to spend. Last but not least, I need to know anything else I must know to have a successful server.</description>
