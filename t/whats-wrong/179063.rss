    <title>What&#39;s wrong..?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whats-wrong/179063</link>
    <description>I can&#39;t help it :\ I started trying to make servers about a month ago and failed at it so I want to post pics and see if anyone knows what I did wrong. This will get me back on track. Someone point out what I did wrong. I can already log onto my server though. 

By the Way, the 3 digit numbers on starting ip address and the command prompt is my ip address on start&gt;run&gt;cmd&gt;ipconfig. If that isn&#39;t the right ip, tell me what I am supposed to use for the portforward starting ip address. Someone said that they reset their router and before they did that their server worked. I&#39;ve changed my router that is why my default gateway is not the default one like everyone elses
