    <title>How would i do this ON a 307 server. Making people, and me Admins+ editing stats</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/how-would-i-do-this-on-a-307-server-making-people-and-me-admins-editing-stats/291132</link>
    <description>Im wondering on a 307 server How do I make me and other people admins/mods. Also how do I edit my stats, So like I can press a button, edit them, or make a command that only admins can use to have 99 in all stats? And were would I add this command? thanks.</description>

go into your character file then go to characters, it will say rights and it will be 0, make them 3 and to make you have stats, it will say player level or something and just change the exp to like 999999999 and then make it 99, then save, then no need to compile, just make sure your logged out when you do this, or the other person.<br>
