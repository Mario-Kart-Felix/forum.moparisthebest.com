    <description>[center]Hello everyone,
Eballer48 to answer the age old question that every nub out there wants to know.
[i]HOW DO I MAKE A RUNESCAPE PRIVATE SERVER!?[/i] Well thats an easy question..
There are several tuts out there all over the internet and most of them are complicated
and out dated, my goal here is to  help those who need it and get more RSPS out there! [/center]

[b]Difficulty:[/b] 5

[b]Length:[/b] 10-60 Mins

[b]What you need:[/b] Common Sense

[b]TABLE OF CONTENTS[/b]

[b]1[/b] Downloads

[b]2[/b] Class &amp; Classpath

[b]3[/b] Downloads (2)

[b]4[/b] No-IP

[b]5[/b] Port Forwarding

[b]6[/b] Getting Your Server Online


[size=14pt][b]3 - DOWNLOADS[/b][/size] 

Alright the first step to getting your own private server all over the inter-webz is [b]JAVA.[/b]
Why? Well you see runescape, as well as the servers, are coded in a computer language called
java. You can download java [url=http://java.com/en/download/chrome.jsp?locale=en]HERE![/url] you will also need JDK which you can get [url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u26-download-400750.html]HERE![/url]
[i]ABOUT JDK[/i] - Well when you click the JDK link the first thing you may notice is a list of different download links
read through the list finding an appropriate link, the appropriate link for me would be the very last one.
&quot;Windows x64&quot; Meaning JDK for Windows 64 Bit. I will go ahead and post a few links for windows users:
[url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions]CLICK HERE[/url] TO FIND OUT IF YOUR 32 OR 64 BIT ON W7 FOR XP/VISTA [url=http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+tell+if+your+32+or+64+bit+windows+vista+and+xp]CLICK HERE![/url]
[url=http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/6u26-b03/jdk-6u26-windows-i586.exe]Windows 32 Bit[/url]
[url=http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/6u26-b03/jdk-6u26-windows-x64.exe]Windows 64 Bit[/url]
Note: Incase your wondering what JDK 6u26 or JDK 6u24 is basically is just means the update of JDK for example...
[code]JDK 6u26 means Java Developer Kit Build 6 Update 26[/code] 
Alright now the most important thing to download for a runescape private server! (RSPS) [b]THE SOURCE![/b]
Alright if you dont know what a source is then GTFO. I&#39;ve provided a link to a list of local sources here on Moparscape:
[url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,488887.0.html]HERES[/url] the thread for sources here on moparscape.
Note: To download a source you will need [b]WINRAR[/b] which you can download [url=http://www.win-rar.com/index.php?id=predownload&amp;dl=/rar/wrar401.exe]HERE![/url]

[size=14pt][b]2 - CLASS &amp; CLASSPATH[/b][/size] 

Congratulations you&#39;ve made it through chapter 1! This means your one your way to becoming an owner
to a newly found runescape private server! w00t! Okay so what is a CLASS and a CLASSPATH you might
be asking yourself, well its basically just a path for java, so dumbed down it means it tell java where to
go! Yay! You smart nao! Alright yo lets get started so there are two ways to do this! The automatic way
and the manual way. Okay so I recently saw a program, a fellow Moparscape user named [b]EVIL_[/b] created.

[b]AUTOMATIC WAY[/b]
This program automatically sets your CLASS and CLASSPATH like all other programs its not 100% guaranteed
to work and will [b]NOT[/b] work for everyone! To read up more about this program you can click [url=http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,471074.0.html]HERE[/url] to go to
the orginal thread for this program, otherwise click [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?855q6rhbp055s4n]HERE[/url] to download the program! NOTE: You need .NET 2.0
or higher to use this program which can download [url=http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=19]HERE[/url]

[b]MANUAL WAY (RECOMMENDED)[/b]
I personally recommend this way because it works 100% no matter what as long as ya do it right  ;) 
Alright so the first step is to find your java/jdk folder mine is..
[code]C:\Program Files (x86)\Java[/code]
Okay so keep this open and Navigate to your system..
You can do this by one of two ways, One click the [b]START[/b] button and then right click on [b][i]COMPUTER[/i][/b] and [b][i]PROPERTIES[/i][/b]
And the second way is to copy this..
[code]Control Panel\System and Security\System[/code]
and then go to you [b][i]DOCUMENTS[/i][/b] or [b][i]COMPUTER[/i][/b] and then paste it into the navigation bar at the top of the folder!
Keep in mind this is for Vista/7 for XP click [url=http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+get+to+environmental+variables+windows+xp]HERE[/url]
Okay so now look for something call [b][i]ADVANCED SYSTEM SETTINGS[/i][/b] and then click it! You should now be at your
advanced system settings, and if your on XP and clicked the link above you should already be here! Now find a button called
[b][i] ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES[/i][/b] and click it. Now you should see two boxes with a few buttons under each. Click new
under the top box and then a new box will appear with two text box. On the top text box type...
[code]PATJ[/code]
Caps are needed. Then on the bottom text box you need to put your link to your JDK Bin. For example mine is...
[code]C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin[/code]
Alright now thats done we need to repeat this step only for the bottom box and instead of PATH type
[code]CLASSPATH[/code]
and instead of a link to your JDK bin you need a link to your java folder inside of your jdk folder. For example mine is...
[code]C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\jre\bin[/code]
Hit okay and then your done, CLASS and CLASSPATH set ;)

[b] PATH [/b] [img]http://imwebhosting.com/img/icon_checkmark.gif[/img]
[b] CLASSPATH [/b] [img]http://imwebhosting.com/img/icon_checkmark.gif[/img]


[size=14pt][b]3 - DOWNLOADS (2)[/b][/size] 

Thought ya were done downloading did ya? Well..  [size=18pt]GOTCHA![/size] Hehe :D
Okay only two things to download now. No-Ip and uTorrent. Why uTorrent you ask? Well wait I&#39;ll explain later!
I&#39;ll just keep this short and sweet download No-Ip [url=https://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php]HERE[/url]
and you can download uTorrent [url=http://www.utorrent.com/]HERE[/url] Easy enough?

[b][i][u]Check list[/u][/i][/b]

[b] No-IP [/b] [img]http://imwebhosting.com/img/icon_checkmark.gif[/img]
[b] uTorrent [/b] [img]http://imwebhosting.com/img/icon_checkmark.gif[/img]



[size=14pt][b]4 - NO-IP[/b][/size] 

Okay so go [url=http://no-ip.com]HERE[/url] register an account and then go to [b][i]ADD A HOST[/i][/b] which should be under [b]YOUR NO-IP[/b] on the toolbar. Once there type in the desired name for your RSPS under [b][i]HOSTNAME:[/i][/b]
after that type in what kind of extension you want. EX; no-ip.biz, no-ip.org; zapto.org, hopto.me, etc. The No-ip. biz/org/info are the most popular. 
After you&#39;ve done this dont mess with any other settings and just click [b]CREATE HOST.[/b] Okay so you should Have No-Ip downloaded.
Now this programs a bit weird and doesn&#39;t install any short cuts however just navigate to the folder it installed to, mine is...
[code]C:\Program Files (x86)\No-IP[/code]
Just go there and double click [b]DUC30[/b]
That should start up No-Ip, a box will appear just enter in your email and password you registered your No-Ip account with.
After you do that a box or two will appear just look for the one that says your host on it. So mine would be REPisAWSOME.no-ip.biz
There should be a check box next to it, just make sure its checked then hit [b]SAVE[/b] Then that box will disappear and a smaller
box will be there and there should be 3 green check marks. If so then hit the X and No-Ip will minimize to your tray. If the box with
your host didn&#39;t come up then hit the [b]SELECT HOST[/b] button and it should.

[b] Add a Host [/b] [img]http://imwebhosting.com/img/icon_checkmark.gif[/img]


[size=14pt][b]5 - Port FORWARDING[/b][/size] 

Yay! w00t w00t! Almost done! :D Remember how you downloaded uTorrent? Well this is where it comes into use! :D
Yupp I give you [b]THE EASIEST WAY TO PORT FORWARDING![/b] z0mg nozz!
YES! Okay go ahead and open up uTorrent. On the toolbar click on [b]OPTIONS[/b] and then [b] PREFERENCES[/b] a box should
pop up. There should be a column on the left click the one that says [b]CONNECTION[/b] and then enter these settings...
[code]Enable UPnp port mapping
Enable NAT-PMP port mapping
Add Windows Firewall exception
Port used for incoming connections: 43594[/code]
Hit okay and then hit the X on uTorrent and just like No-Ip it should minimize to the tray!

[b] Port Forwarding [/b] [img]http://imwebhosting.com/img/icon_checkmark.gif[/img]


[size=14pt][b]6 - GETTING YOUR SERVER ONLINE[/b][/size] 

Yessir! The final step until you can brag to everyone that you&#39;ve got a FREAKING RSPS! w00t baby! Alright so you know that source
you downloaded? Well go ahead and drag/extract it to your desktop. Once thats done go into your source folder and find a run.bat
right click on the run.bat (also might be called runserver.bat) and hit [b]EDIT[/b] and it should open with Notepad. Now look at the code if its something like this...
[code]@echo off
title EscapeOfRunes
java -Xmx512m -cp bin;deps/poi.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar;deps/jython.jar;log4j-1.2.15.jar; server.Server
pause[/code]
It should rune fine, now if its something like so...
[code]@echo off
title REPisAWSOME is now Online!
&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin&quot; -Xmx512m
pause[/code]
Then all you have to do is change two things (maybe) now the first is make sure its the right program files. It might be...
[code]\Program Files (x86)\[/code] or [code]\Program Files\[/code] just make sure its the appropriate one for you.
Secondly look at the [code]\jdk1.6.0_24\[/code] makes sure it says which version of JDK you have. After that save it.
Next do the same thing to the Compile.bat and save it. Now rune the compiler and then the Run.bat
Note: Its important not to change the code in the run.bat because every source has a different one.
Now if you did everything right it should be working, if not people usually screw up at CLASS and CLASSPATH. If you did the automatic
CLASS and CLASSPATH then see back to Chapter 2 and try the manual way. Now if everything working fine try to log into your server
using moparscapes webclient or if you downloaded a client with your source! Now if you did everything right then...

              <p>[center]Hello everyone,<br>
Eballer48 to answer the age old question that every nub out there wants to know.<br>
<span class="bbcode-i">HOW DO I MAKE A RUNESCAPE PRIVATE SERVER!?</span> Well thats an easy question…<br>
There are several tuts out there all over the internet and most of them are complicated<br>
and out dated, my goal here is to  help those who need it and get more RSPS out there! [/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty:</span> 5</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Length:</span> 10-60 Mins</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">What you need:</span> Common Sense</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">TABLE OF CONTENTS</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">1</span> Downloads</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">2</span> Class &amp; Classpath</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">5</span> Port Forwarding</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">6</span> Getting Your Server Online</p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">3 - DOWNLOADS</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Alright the first step to getting your own private server all over the inter-webz is <span class="bbcode-b">JAVA.</span><br>
Why? Well you see runescape, as well as the servers, are coded in a computer language called<br>
java. You can download java <a href="http://java.com/en/download/chrome.jsp?locale=en" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE!</a> you will also need JDK which you can get <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-6u26-download-400750.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE!</a><br>
<span class="bbcode-i">ABOUT JDK</span> - Well when you click the JDK link the first thing you may notice is a list of different download links<br>
read through the list finding an appropriate link, the appropriate link for me would be the very last one.<br>
“Windows x64” Meaning JDK for Windows 64 Bit. I will go ahead and post a few links for windows users:<br>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CLICK HERE</a> TO FIND OUT IF YOUR 32 OR 64 BIT ON W7 FOR XP/VISTA <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+tell+if+your+32+or+64+bit+windows+vista+and+xp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">CLICK HERE!</a><br>
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/6u26-b03/jdk-6u26-windows-i586.exe" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows 32 Bit</a><br>
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/6u26-b03/jdk-6u26-windows-x64.exe" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows 64 Bit</a><br>
Note: Incase your wondering what JDK 6u26 or JDK 6u24 is basically is just means the update of JDK for example…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">JDK 6u26 means Java Developer Kit Build 6 Update 26</code></pre>
<p>Alright now the most important thing to download for a runescape private server! (RSPS) <span class="bbcode-b">THE SOURCE!</span><br>
Alright if you dont know what a source is then GTFO. I’ve provided a link to a list of local sources here on Moparscape:<br>
<a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,488887.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERES</a> the thread for sources here on moparscape.<br>

<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">2 - CLASS &amp; CLASSPATH</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Congratulations you’ve made it through chapter 1! This means your one your way to becoming an owner<br>
to a newly found runescape private server! w00t! Okay so what is a CLASS and a CLASSPATH you might<br>
be asking yourself, well its basically just a path for java, so dumbed down it means it tell java where to<br>
go! Yay! You smart nao! Alright yo lets get started so there are two ways to do this! The automatic way<br>
and the manual way. Okay so I recently saw a program, a fellow Moparscape user named <span class="bbcode-b">EVIL_</span> created.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">AUTOMATIC WAY</span><br>
This program automatically sets your CLASS and CLASSPATH like all other programs its not 100% guaranteed<br>
to work and will <span class="bbcode-b">NOT</span> work for everyone! To read up more about this program you can click <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,471074.0.html" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a> to go to<br>
the orginal thread for this program, otherwise click <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?855q6rhbp055s4n" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a> to download the program! NOTE: You need .NET 2.0<br>
or higher to use this program which can download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=19" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">MANUAL WAY (RECOMMENDED)</span><br>
I personally recommend this way because it works 100% no matter what as long as ya do it right  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"><br>
Alright so the first step is to find your java/jdk folder mine is…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">C:\Program Files (x86)\Java</code></pre>
<p>Okay so keep this open and Navigate to your system…<br>
You can do this by one of two ways, One click the <span class="bbcode-b">START</span> button and then right click on <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">COMPUTER</span></span> and <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">PROPERTIES</span></span><br>
And the second way is to copy this…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Control Panel\System and Security\System</code></pre>
<p>and then go to you <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">DOCUMENTS</span></span> or <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">COMPUTER</span></span> and then paste it into the navigation bar at the top of the folder!<br>
Keep in mind this is for Vista/7 for XP click <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+get+to+environmental+variables+windows+xp" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a><br>
Okay so now look for something call <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">ADVANCED SYSTEM SETTINGS</span></span> and then click it! You should now be at your<br>
advanced system settings, and if your on XP and clicked the link above you should already be here! Now find a button called<br>
<span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"> ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES</span></span> and click it. Now you should see two boxes with a few buttons under each. Click new<br>
under the top box and then a new box will appear with two text box. On the top text box type…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">PATJ</code></pre>
<p>Caps are needed. Then on the bottom text box you need to put your link to your JDK Bin. For example mine is…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin</code></pre>
<p>Alright now thats done we need to repeat this step only for the bottom box and instead of PATH type</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">CLASSPATH</code></pre>
<p>and instead of a link to your JDK bin you need a link to your java folder inside of your jdk folder. For example mine is…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\jre\bin</code></pre>
<p>Hit okay and then your done, CLASS and CLASSPATH set <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

Okay only two things to download now. No-Ip and uTorrent. Why uTorrent you ask? Well wait I’ll explain later!<br>
I’ll just keep this short and sweet download No-Ip <a href="https://www.no-ip.com/downloads.php" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a><br>
and you can download uTorrent <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a> Easy enough?</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i"><span class="bbcode-u">Check list</span></span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"> No-IP </span> <img src="http://imwebhosting.com/img/icon_checkmark.gif" alt width="" height=""><br>
<span class="bbcode-b"> uTorrent </span> <img src="http://imwebhosting.com/img/icon_checkmark.gif" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">4 - NO-IP</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Okay so go <a href="http://no-ip.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">HERE</a> register an account and then go to <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">ADD A HOST</span></span> which should be under <span class="bbcode-b">YOUR NO-IP</span> on the toolbar. Once there type in the desired name for your RSPS under <span class="bbcode-b"><span class="bbcode-i">HOSTNAME:</span></span><br>
after that type in what kind of extension you want. EX; no-ip.biz, <a href="http://no-ip.org" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.org</a>; <a href="http://zapto.org" rel="nofollow noopener">zapto.org</a>, <a href="http://hopto.me" rel="nofollow noopener">hopto.me</a>, etc. The No-ip. biz/org/info are the most popular.<br>
After you’ve done this dont mess with any other settings and just click <span class="bbcode-b">CREATE HOST.</span> Okay so you should Have No-Ip downloaded.<br>
Now this programs a bit weird and doesn’t install any short cuts however just navigate to the folder it installed to, mine is…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">C:\Program Files (x86)\No-IP</code></pre>
<p>Just go there and double click <span class="bbcode-b">DUC30</span><br>
That should start up No-Ip, a box will appear just enter in your email and password you registered your No-Ip account with.<br>
After you do that a box or two will appear just look for the one that says your host on it. So mine would be REPisAWSOME.no-ip.biz<br>
There should be a check box next to it, just make sure its checked then hit <span class="bbcode-b">SAVE</span> Then that box will disappear and a smaller<br>
box will be there and there should be 3 green check marks. If so then hit the X and No-Ip will minimize to your tray. If the box with<br>
your host didn’t come up then hit the <span class="bbcode-b">SELECT HOST</span> button and it should.</p>

<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">5 - Port FORWARDING</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Yay! w00t w00t! Almost done! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> Remember how you downloaded uTorrent? Well this is where it comes into use! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>
Yupp I give you <span class="bbcode-b">THE EASIEST WAY TO PORT FORWARDING!</span> z0mg nozz!<br>
YES! Okay go ahead and open up uTorrent. On the toolbar click on <span class="bbcode-b">OPTIONS</span> and then <span class="bbcode-b"> PREFERENCES</span> a box should<br>
pop up. There should be a column on the left click the one that says <span class="bbcode-b">CONNECTION</span> and then enter these settings…</p>
<p><code>Enable UPnp port mapping
Enable NAT-PMP port mapping
Add Windows Firewall exception
Port used for incoming connections: 43594</code><br>
Hit okay and then hit the X on uTorrent and just like No-Ip it should minimize to the tray!</p>

<p>[size=14pt]<span class="bbcode-b">6 - GETTING YOUR SERVER ONLINE</span>[/size]</p>
<p>Yessir! The final step until you can brag to everyone that you’ve got a FREAKING RSPS! w00t baby! Alright so you know that source<br>
you downloaded? Well go ahead and drag/extract it to your desktop. Once thats done go into your source folder and find a run.bat<br>
right click on the run.bat (also might be called runserver.bat) and hit <span class="bbcode-b">EDIT</span> and it should open with Notepad. Now look at the code if its something like this…</p>
<p><code>@echo off
title EscapeOfRunes
java -Xmx512m -cp bin;deps/poi.jar;deps/mysql.jar;deps/mina.jar;deps/slf4j.jar;deps/slf4j-nop.jar;deps/jython.jar;log4j-1.2.15.jar; server.Server
pause</code><br>
It should rune fine, now if its something like so…</p>
<p><code>@echo off
title REPisAWSOME is now Online!
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.6.0_24\bin" -Xmx512m
pause</code><br>
Then all you have to do is change two things (maybe) now the first is make sure its the right program files. It might be…</p>
<p><code>\Program Files (x86)\</code> or <code>\Program Files\</code> just make sure its the appropriate one for you.<br>
Secondly look at the <code>\jdk1.6.0_24\</code> makes sure it says which version of JDK you have. After that save it.<br>
Next do the same thing to the Compile.bat and save it. Now rune the compiler and then the Run.bat<br>
Note: Its important not to change the code in the run.bat because every source has a different one.<br>
Now if you did everything right it should be working, if not people usually screw up at CLASS and CLASSPATH. If you did the automatic<br>
CLASS and CLASSPATH then see back to Chapter 2 and try the manual way. Now if everything working fine try to log into your server<br>
using moparscapes webclient or if you downloaded a client with your source! Now if you did everything right then…</p>
