    <title>[PI] positioning stillgfx correctly</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-positioning-stillgfx-correctly/541341</link>
    <description>So I&#39;m rewriting prayer on my server, and I&#39;ve almost finished. However, when you use bones on the altar, you get some funky results as to where your player turns (using c.turnPlayerTo(int x, int y) ) and where the stillGfx lands ( c.getPA().stillGfx(int id, int x, int y, int z, int time) ).

I&#39;m trying to figure out how to make it so it automatically puts the stillgfx on the correct side of the altar (Since an altar is 2 squares long, depending on your X/Y it&#39;d go on one or the other) and your player turning to face the same spot.

Well, after using a nasty looking if-else statement didn&#39;t work, I decided to start debugging by subtracting my current X and Y from the Objects X and Y, so I could see the difference. I used 2 altars, each rotated a different way. The results after debugging:
[code]
[3/18/14 10:00 PM]: XDiff: 1 YDiff: 0
[3/18/14 10:00 PM]: XDiff: 1 YDiff: 1
[3/18/14 10:00 PM]: XDiff: 0 YDiff: 1
[3/18/14 10:00 PM]: XDiff: 1 YDiff: 1
[/code]
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s obvious to you, but if it isn&#39;t, here is the issue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[3/18/14 10:00 PM]: XDiff: 1 YDiff: 0
[3/18/14 10:00 PM]: XDiff: 1 YDiff: 1
[3/18/14 10:00 PM]: XDiff: 0 YDiff: 1
[3/18/14 10:00 PM]: XDiff: 1 YDiff: 1&lt;/blockquote&gt;

How could I manage to make it so the gfx will show accordingly (I honestly could care less about facing)?</description>
