    <description>This is how i will have degrading barrows.

i have my public int for 500 toragsHP
public int toragsHP = 500;

now im thinking, 
maybe like, if you hit... 50.. you would loose 25 toragHP

would this be a good way to start?
im not sure how to code it so half the hitdiff will be taken from toragsHP

could this work?
[code]
if (toragsHP &gt;= 375){
if(playerEquipment[playerWeapon] == (4958)) 
if(playerEquipment[playerChest] == (4964))
if(playerEquipment[playerLegs] == (4970))
if(playerEquipment[playerHat] == (4952)){
toragsHP - hitdiff/2;
}
} else if (toragsHP = 374){
sendMessage(&quot;Your Torags have degraded!&quot;);
}
[/code]</description>

Why would you want to make Barrows armor degrade? Don’t you like it always having full strength??<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>im making degrading barrows becuase its not a common thing in private servers, and if i were to code them, atleast i’d have that to my self and say, yeh i coded that Myself.</p>
<p>newb, yes i am using that.</p>
<p>i put it into a command, so i could test the outcome of a degrade.</p>
<p>[code]<br>
if (command.startsWith(“hattrick”)){<br>
deleteequiment(1153, playerHat);<br>
setEquipment(1149, 1, playerHat);<br>
playerEquipment[playerHat]=1149;</p>

<p>( no this isnt the final code lol. its jus in a testing phase )</p>
<p>the hitDiff * 2… should subtract the torags hp…  i think im missing something, but idk what… hmm… seems funny, people said they actualy have degrading barrows. where are they now  :eek:<br>
HELLOO!?<br>
<em>listens</em> <em>echo</em></p>

              <p>Tom, many people want servers more like Runescape, but easier to train in so they can have the power like maxed people on Runescape do. They create private servers because they’re not very good at Runescape, and realise how shitty it is. Then they want to recreate it, and they find Moparscape and then they make a server so they can have their updates wanted with some updates that Runescape has, so they can enjoy the fun.</p>
<p>Your question is like asking Jagex why they’re brittish. The answer is obvious if you don’t know what it is, it’s because their parents are brittish, they live in England, or whatever, and are Brittish. Anymore to add? I don’t think so, so please refrain from asking retarded questions anymore.
