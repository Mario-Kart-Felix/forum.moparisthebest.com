    <description>Sorry if mods dont like this, but it isnt really advertising a website.

Right people wanna have some fun?
go to www.chacha.com
type in something (preferably not rude)
then click &quot;search with guide&quot; 
you should then be connected to a person (yes these are real people beleive it or not)
and they will help you find what you are looking for.


i asked some woman to find me meat helmets... she spent like half an hour looking for one... hah :)

anyways post your funny conversations with chacha people here :)
happy chachaing 


oh and some information on how people work for chacha -

People join up to chacha from home (like home pc, but im not sure how).
Then after they have helped someone the person is supposed to tell chacha how helpfull the person has been, once you get alot of people saying you are helpful chacha send you money.]]

ok here is an example of my conversation moments ago(also may i add im quite frustrated that the guy was playing along):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Status: Looking for a guide ...
Status: Connected to guide: JasonR
JasonR: Welcome to ChaCha!
You: Hi
JasonR: hello
JasonR: Please be more specific as to what you&#39;re looking for on this topic.
You: I&#39;m looking for my leopard
JasonR: did you lose it, uh?
You: yeah oh where can he be?
You: oh he&#39;s probably somewhree looking for me.
JasonR: Probably in a tree
JasonR: looking at me?
JasonR: !
JasonR: Oh do you see
JasonR: he maybe at the golf course there on the tee
JasonR: Saying his A B C&#39;s
JasonR: maybe even D and E
You: i dont understand where is this golf course you speak of.
JasonR: it is over seas
You: where abouts?
JasonR: In Turkey
JasonR: not the bird, you see
JasonR: but the country
You: ok i&#39;d like you to book me a one way flight to turkey please.
JasonR: To Turkey?
You: yes
You: and i&#39;d like a personal assistant called johnson who i can yell at through an intercom and say &quot;JOHNSON GET IN MY OFFICE&quot;
JasonR: lol
JasonR: You shall have what you request
JasonR: can [b]Joshson[/b] be a female
You: just so long as i find my leopard.
You: um
You: its johnson
JasonR: We only have one Johnson
JasonR: Shirley is her name
You: and yes as long as they are called johnson
JasonR: Big woman
You: NO NOT SHIRLY
You: johnson
JasonR: YEs, that is her - Big ol Shirley Johnson
JasonR: She will be required to have THREE Seats on the plane to Turkey
You: well im afraid that wont do, i need someone who will answer to the name of johnson
JasonR: her name is johnson
JasonR: Shirley Johnson
JasonR: She will reply.
You: is she there right now?
JasonR: Just don&#39;t make her mad
JasonR: No, she is special ordered. She will meet you at the airport
JasonR: You can&#39;t miss her
JasonR: No one misses Shirley when she walks through a crowd
You: she needs to be holding a sign saying [b]&quot;iamaminer1&quot;[/b]
JasonR: You really don&#39;t tell Shirly what she is going to do . . . it makes her mad
JasonR: Remember she is BIG OL Shirley Johnson
You: i have a friend who deleted the internets and his name was iamaminer1 and its actually his leopard thats why i need it back quick becaues he doesnt know ive taken it
JasonR: Well I suggest you go find it. . quick
JasonR: Well I must go and do the Cha Cha with others
You: well if you would book me plane tickets (4 now because of big ol shirley johnson) straight to turkey so i can go to this golf course and find the darn leopard.
JasonR: that will get you started
You: ok that will do i think
JasonR: Please RATE ME. Thanks for using ChaCha.
