    <description>Pancakes Pk Returns
With New Twists And Turns...
can you handle it?


Pancakes Pk V.3

Im not sure if you renember pancakes pk or not, but it was fun.
with the arise of the new silab client i decieded to bring back
pancakes pk to pleasure the players of Silabsoft.

I have a clean base for a new server. its Pimpscape Non-pk.
it has many stats, and many cool features.
its also very flexible.
I need a design team to help me out and build this server with me.
i can handle building a server, ive proven it before,
but my problem is i dont have many ideas, and i cant stay motivated for long.
if you would like to help me bring back this fun server, please register to my forums at:
