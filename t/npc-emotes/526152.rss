    <title>Npc emotes</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npc-emotes/526152</link>
    <description>so ive just been fixing emotes for my npc that are glitched.
and i came across jungle demon.
but when it was spawned, it was all glitched.

to add a walk/run emote for it, would i have to add the npc to entityDef?
or is there some file i can edit the walk/run in?</description>
