    <title>[508] Surgeon General Tafani healing. [In depth] [Basic]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/508-surgeon-general-tafani-healing-in-depth-basic/344659</link>
    <description>Alright guys.
This is a pretty basic tutorial, explaining how to make Surgeon General Tafani work.

[b]Difficulty[/b] -- 1/10. Basic knowledge of Java needed to understand.
[b]Edited files[/b] -- The NPCOption2 class.

[b]Don&#39;t hate me because I went into depth on NPC dialogue. I did it because it helps people understand more, which is what I aim to help with.[/b]


---

Alright, there&#39;s 2 options for Surgeon General Tafani.
Option 1 is talk.
The second option is of course, [b]heal.[/b]
In RuneScape, she heals your hitpoints. I&#39;ll be teaching you today a simple form to make that work; as well as making it restore your run energy if wanted.

--

Okay! Let&#39;s get to it.
First open the NPCOption2 class.

Ctrl+F and search for:
[code]switch (npcType) {[/code]

Underneath this, we&#39;ll add the case for Surgeon General Tafani.

According to my NPC list, she&#39;s 961.

So let&#39;s start off with a case for her.

[code]case 961:[/code]

Next what we want to do is use the NPCDialogue method to allow her to speak to you.
If you don&#39;t have this method -- in the Player class, add this.

[code]    public void sendNpcDialogue(int id, int npcId, String npcName, String text, String text2) {
        actionSender.showChatboxInterface(this, 242);
        actionSender.animateInterfaceId(this, 9827, 242, 2);
        actionSender.setNPCId(this, npcId, 242, 2);
        actionSender.setString(this, npcName, 242, 3);
        actionSender.setString(this, text, 242, 4);
        actionSender.setString(this, text2, 242, 5);
        this.dialogueId = id;
    }
[/code]

This is pretty self explanatory, yet if you don&#39;t get it, see if you can compare the methods first line to any NPC dialogue line you have. It&#39;s pretty much just explaining what you should put where. [i]Hence the int NpcId? You must be stupid to not understand that, sorry.[/i]

So let&#39;s start building up this dialogue.

Since you now have the method, here&#39;s a plain code you&#39;ll use.

[code]
p.sendNpcDialogue();
[/code]
So let&#39;s work on making this like it&#39;s supposed to be.
In the method, the first thing it&#39;s asking for is [i]int id.[/i]
Just put 0, this isn&#39;t a tutorial explaining that. So don&#39;t worry about it, just put 0. Here&#39;s what we have so far:
[code]
p.sendNpcDialogue(0);[/code]

Next, it&#39;s asking for a new int for the NPC ID. So add a comma after the 0, and place the NPC ID, which is 961.

[code]
p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961);[/code]

Now the methods asking for a String, the NPC name. So we&#39;ll need some quotations, and the NPC&#39;s name: Surgeon General Tafani.
[code]
p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961, &quot;Surgeon General Tafani&quot;);[/code]

And now it wants the text, of course. I wasn&#39;t sure what RuneScape&#39;s text was officially, so I made my own semi-professional one.

[code]p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961, &quot;Surgeon General Tafani&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ve healed you back to 99 Hitpoints&quot;,
&quot;and restored your running energy.&quot;);[/code]

Now I know what you&#39;re thinking. &quot;Oh no, there&#39;s 2 lines of text! You only said one!!!&quot;.
Chill your panties please. It&#39;s simple to understand the first line is top and the second line is on the bottom, like so:
[img]http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/604/47784057.png[/img]

So now our [b]so far[/b] finished case is:
[code]            case 961:
			p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961, &quot;Surgeon General Tafani&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ve healed you back to 99 Hitpoints&quot;,
					&quot;and restored your running energy.&quot;);[/code]


Yay! Our text is done! Let&#39;s finish up with the Health and Running energy now.
So, we want our server to know it&#39;s Hitpoints we&#39;re trying to heal.
For this, we want the skill level. Which is 3. We also want the server to know what level our skill is.

So we&#39;re going to use 4 methods.

[b]Method 1 - skillLvl()[/b]. - [i]This method allows the server to detect what skill we&#39;re defining.[/i]
[b]Method 2- getLevelForXP()[/b] - [i]Come on. The method name gives it up. I don&#39;t want to spoonfeed it all to you..[/i]
[b]Method 3 - getActionSender()[/b] - [i]I shouldn&#39;t have to go in depth with this one. The method is 2 lines for gods sake.[/i]
[b]Method 4 - setSkillLvl()[/b] - [i]Will let us set the level back to what it is.[/i]

So! Let&#39;s begin.

We want to find get to the server that we want the players hitpoints healed.
So, we&#39;ll start with this.

[code]p.skillLvl[3][/code]
This is telling the server we&#39;re talking about HP.

Now, we&#39;ll add in this: p.getLevelForXP(3);
Why? We want the server to know what level we are.. Don&#39;t we? We want FULL health, not partial. So let&#39;s set these like this:

[code]p.skillLvl[3] = p.getLevelForXP(3);[/code]

That will go directly below your dialogue you just got finished with.

But it&#39;s not done yet. Now we want our server to set us back to the level we are. So we call upon the actionSender (frames for some of you, you may have to change this part) to do this for us.

[code]p.getActionSender()[/code]
But what does our action sender want to do? We want it to make us back to full hitpoints. So we&#39;ll set it to your level by using this:
[code]setSkillLvl(p, 3);[/code]
So our full code here is:
[code]p.getActionSender().setSkillLvl(p, 3);[/code]

So health is officially back to normal.

Now let&#39;s update energy.
Energy&#39;s a bit easier.
We&#39;re using 2 methods now.

[b]Method 1 - runEnergy()[/b] - [/i]Sets the players run energy.[/i]
[b]Method 2 - runEnergyUpdateReq()[/b] - [i]Updates it.[/i]

So it&#39;s simple, we just do this:
[code]
p.runEnergy = 100;
p.runEnergyUpdateReq = true;[/code]

Set the energy to 100 and make it update.
And that&#39;s it folks.
Here&#39;s our full case:

[code]
            case 961:
			p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961, &quot;Surgeon General Tafani&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ve healed you back to 99 Hitpoints&quot;,
					&quot;and restored your running energy.&quot;);
                	p.skillLvl[3] = p.getLevelForXP(3);
                	p.getActionSender().setSkillLvl(p, 3);
               	 	p.runEnergy = 100;
                	p.runEnergyUpdateReq = true;
		break;[/code]

Hopefully you learned something here.
I apologize if anything&#39;s wrong here, I myself am still learning Java.

Hope this was in depth enough for you, post any errors you may have.
thanks, - it0ken.</description>

              <p>Alright guys.<br>
This is a pretty basic tutorial, explaining how to make Surgeon General Tafani work.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Difficulty</span> – 1/10. Basic knowledge of Java needed to understand.<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Edited files</span> – The NPCOption2 class.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Don’t hate me because I went into depth on NPC dialogue. I did it because it helps people understand more, which is what I aim to help with.</span></p>
<hr>
<p>Alright, there’s 2 options for Surgeon General Tafani.<br>
Option 1 is talk.<br>
The second option is of course, <span class="bbcode-b">heal.</span><br>
In RuneScape, she heals your hitpoints. I’ll be teaching you today a simple form to make that work; as well as making it restore your run energy if wanted.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Okay! Let’s get to it.<br>
First open the NPCOption2 class.</p>
<p>Ctrl+F and search for:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">switch (npcType) {</code></pre>
<p>Underneath this, we’ll add the case for Surgeon General Tafani.</p>
<p>According to my NPC list, she’s 961.</p>
<p>So let’s start off with a case for her.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">case 961:</code></pre>
<p>Next what we want to do is use the NPCDialogue method to allow her to speak to you.<br>
If you don’t have this method – in the Player class, add this.</p>
<p><code>    public void sendNpcDialogue(int id, int npcId, String npcName, String text, String text2) {
        actionSender.showChatboxInterface(this, 242);
        actionSender.animateInterfaceId(this, 9827, 242, 2);
        actionSender.setNPCId(this, npcId, 242, 2);
        actionSender.setString(this, npcName, 242, 3);
        actionSender.setString(this, text, 242, 4);
        actionSender.setString(this, text2, 242, 5);
        this.dialogueId = id;
    }
</code></p>
<p>This is pretty self explanatory, yet if you don’t get it, see if you can compare the methods first line to any NPC dialogue line you have. It’s pretty much just explaining what you should put where. <span class="bbcode-i">Hence the int NpcId? You must be stupid to not understand that, sorry.</span></p>
<p>So let’s start building up this dialogue.</p>
<p>Since you now have the method, here’s a plain code you’ll use.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p.sendNpcDialogue();</code></pre>
<p>So let’s work on making this like it’s supposed to be.<br>
In the method, the first thing it’s asking for is <span class="bbcode-i">int id.</span><br>
Just put 0, this isn’t a tutorial explaining that. So don’t worry about it, just put 0. Here’s what we have so far:</p>
<p><code>
p.sendNpcDialogue(0);</code></p>
<p>Next, it’s asking for a new int for the NPC ID. So add a comma after the 0, and place the NPC ID, which is 961.</p>
<p><code>
p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961);</code></p>
<p>Now the methods asking for a String, the NPC name. So we’ll need some quotations, and the NPC’s name: Surgeon General Tafani.</p>
<p><code>
p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961, "Surgeon General Tafani");</code></p>
<p>And now it wants the text, of course. I wasn’t sure what RuneScape’s text was officially, so I made my own semi-professional one.</p>
<p><code>p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961, "Surgeon General Tafani", "I've healed you back to 99 Hitpoints",
"and restored your running energy.");</code></p>
<p>Now I know what you’re thinking. “Oh no, there’s 2 lines of text! You only said one!!!”.<br>
Chill your panties please. It’s simple to understand the first line is top and the second line is on the bottom, like so:<br>
<img src="http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/604/47784057.png" alt width="" height=""></p>
<p>So now our <span class="bbcode-b">so far</span> finished case is:</p>
<p><code>            case 961:
			p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961, "Surgeon General Tafani", "I've healed you back to 99 Hitpoints",
					"and restored your running energy.");</code></p>
<p>Yay! Our text is done! Let’s finish up with the Health and Running energy now.<br>
So, we want our server to know it’s Hitpoints we’re trying to heal.<br>
For this, we want the skill level. Which is 3. We also want the server to know what level our skill is.</p>
<p>So we’re going to use 4 methods.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Method 1 - skillLvl()</span>. - <span class="bbcode-i">This method allows the server to detect what skill we’re defining.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Method 2- getLevelForXP()</span> - <span class="bbcode-i">Come on. The method name gives it up. I don’t want to spoonfeed it all to you…</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Method 3 - getActionSender()</span> - <span class="bbcode-i">I shouldn’t have to go in depth with this one. The method is 2 lines for gods sake.</span><br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Method 4 - setSkillLvl()</span> - <span class="bbcode-i">Will let us set the level back to what it is.</span></p>
<p>So! Let’s begin.</p>
<p>We want to find get to the server that we want the players hitpoints healed.<br>
So, we’ll start with this.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p.skillLvl[3]</code></pre>
<p>This is telling the server we’re talking about HP.</p>
<p>Now, we’ll add in this: p.getLevelForXP(3);<br>
Why? We want the server to know what level we are… Don’t we? We want FULL health, not partial. So let’s set these like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p.skillLvl[3] = p.getLevelForXP(3);</code></pre>
<p>That will go directly below your dialogue you just got finished with.</p>
<p>But it’s not done yet. Now we want our server to set us back to the level we are. So we call upon the actionSender (frames for some of you, you may have to change this part) to do this for us.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p.getActionSender()</code></pre>
<p>But what does our action sender want to do? We want it to make us back to full hitpoints. So we’ll set it to your level by using this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">setSkillLvl(p, 3);</code></pre>
<p>So our full code here is:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">p.getActionSender().setSkillLvl(p, 3);</code></pre>
<p>So health is officially back to normal.</p>
<p>Now let’s update energy.<br>
Energy’s a bit easier.<br>
We’re using 2 methods now.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Method 1 - runEnergy()</span> - [/i]Sets the players run energy.[/i]<br>
<span class="bbcode-b">Method 2 - runEnergyUpdateReq()</span> - <span class="bbcode-i">Updates it.</span></p>
<p>So it’s simple, we just do this:</p>
<p><code>
p.runEnergy = 100;
p.runEnergyUpdateReq = true;</code></p>
<p>Set the energy to 100 and make it update.<br>
And that’s it folks.<br>
Here’s our full case:</p>
<p><code>
            case 961:
			p.sendNpcDialogue(0, 961, "Surgeon General Tafani", "I've healed you back to 99 Hitpoints",
					"and restored your running energy.");
                	p.skillLvl[3] = p.getLevelForXP(3);
                	p.getActionSender().setSkillLvl(p, 3);
               	 	p.runEnergy = 100;
                	p.runEnergyUpdateReq = true;
		break;</code></p>
<hr>
<p>Hopefully you learned something here.<br>
I apologize if anything’s wrong here, I myself am still learning Java.</p>
<p>Hope this was in depth enough for you, post any errors you may have.<br>
thanks, - it0ken.</p>
