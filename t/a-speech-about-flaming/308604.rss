    <title>A speech about flaming</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-speech-about-flaming/308604</link>
    <description>Just to say, This post may seem useless to some people but its true everything i will tell you is true. You may not want to believe it. So before i start i want to tell you that this is for the people who don’t flame the people who do flame will flame this post this is just a big post (discussion) about flaming so i encourage you to flame and call them examples.

Some people like new people, people Bad at scripting, and even you do something stupid in your life time, you also ask stupid questions. But think about this, when you ask a question that you want to learn more about, don’t be afraid to ask someone. Everybody has some type of question that they know is stupid and they will get insulted for, but the flamers out there. Think about this.. you where that one person at a time or another too and you asked stupid questions that people insulted you for and maybe even put your post in their signatures but hey not all of us are perfect. The main reason you guys are flaming people are because you think they are annoying, stupid, or even lazy because they are asking questions they are confused about. The most common reasons people flame are because the might recolor models, or maybe they ask stupid questions like &quot;i don’t have a client.java where do i download one?&quot;. These are stupid things to get mad about because everyone starts from somewhere you or anybody in the world were born with the knowledge of a college graduate of a programming school or maybe even have a DR. Degree in technology or programming.So why do you guys flame people they are just beginning to learn how to model, program, and maybe even draw so the next time you flame make sure they are actually bad at what they have posted. I know none of the famous people like SilentCJ(modeling), Lin(C language) or anyone that you guys know didn&#39;t just come to mopar and start modeling, or scripting like Pros, They had to of started somewhere. Everyone starts from Skill level one and advances to Skill level 2, 3, And maybe even 4. Next time you flame, Do it for a reason not because you had a bad day and wanted to take your anger out on someone. Thanks for reading this post hope you guys actually take this in and use the information.</description>

<p>on a side note:</p>

<p>Working with rs private servers does not mean you are learning either of these. Infact you learn none of the fundamentals when doing so.</p>

<li>This is the internet most people either go on here for porn or for a laugh.</li>
<li>People often get kicks out of making other people so made they dribble and turn red.</li>
<li>Some people have really weird fettishes and like to watch a mix of people getting really angry and fucking other people. Most commonly bart or lisa simpson.

<p>I understand, but yeah, I did have to start from somewhere, but the difference betweem me and a lot of the other guys is that I’m completely self taught, when I began modelling, there were no tutorials, but some people ask for help on ridiculous questions, when all they have to do is take a little time and effort to experiment with the program and see what each tool does.[/quote]Trial and error is exactly how I learned everything. Questions that I asked here were never answered, except for one about Strings. (answered by mdog a long time ago) I remember because it’s the only real thing I learned from a member of moparscape in a help section.</p>
<p>[quote=“lukenuke75, post:1, topic:308611”]ok yes i did spell check this and i did with word that program didnt spell check right i guess.[/quote]Spellchecker doesn’t check grammar either… And SilentCJ is talking about your title.</p>

Same with server work (not many people know about the side of me that does actually do some coding <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ), I think the only help I’ve ever used is from my first 10 or so posts, the rest was literally all from searching through code, and just experimenting with it, using trial and error to see what each bit does.</p>
<p>It just annoys me when people cannot be bothered, I’m nothing special, I’m just a regular guy, I knew nothing before I came here, except some very basic html knowledge, I had no programming experience whatsoever.<br>
I rarely ever flame anyone, but laziness may just get me going. :rolleyes:</p>

<p>The only people that are actually going to follow this are people that have been following it from the beginning. Someone who would normally ‘flames’ is bound to flame posts <span class="bbcode-i">exactly</span> like this. So why post it? Sorry to crash down on your thunder, but it’s the truth. A rant on flamers is only going to feed their flame.</p>

              <p>Just to say, This post may seem useless to some people but its true everything i will tell you is true. You may not want to believe it. So before i start i want to tell you that this is for the people who don’t flame the people who do flame will flame this post this is just a big post (discussion) about flaming so i encourage you to flame and call them examples.</p>
<p>Some people like new people, people Bad at scripting, and even you do something stupid in your life time, you also ask stupid questions. But think about this, when you ask a question that you want to learn more about, don’t be afraid to ask someone. Everybody has some type of question that they know is stupid and they will get insulted for, but the flamers out there. Think about this… you where that one person at a time or another too and you asked stupid questions that people insulted you for and maybe even put your post in their signatures but hey not all of us are perfect. The main reason you guys are flaming people are because you think they are annoying, stupid, or even lazy because they are asking questions they are confused about. The most common reasons people flame are because the might recolor models, or maybe they ask stupid questions like “i don’t have a client.java where do i download one?”. These are stupid things to get mad about because everyone starts from somewhere you or anybody in the world were born with the knowledge of a college graduate of a programming school or maybe even have a DR. Degree in technology or programming.So why do you guys flame people they are just beginning to learn how to model, program, and maybe even draw so the next time you flame make sure they are actually bad at what they have posted. I know none of the famous people like SilentCJ(modeling), Lin(C language) or anyone that you guys know didn’t just come to mopar and start modeling, or scripting like Pros, They had to of started somewhere. Everyone starts from Skill level one and advances to Skill level 2, 3, And maybe even 4. Next time you flame, Do it for a reason not because you had a bad day and wanted to take your anger out on someone. Thanks for reading this post hope you guys actually take this in and use the information.</p>
