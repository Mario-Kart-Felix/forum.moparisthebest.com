    <title>How to fix this? :o</title>

    <description>Hey guys!

Well, today I was working with Lin&#39;s interface editor and I set it all up and it all works (via compiler) but when I run it it works up until the last thing. Then it says something like &quot;There was an error loading RuneScape&quot; with all the suggestions. If someone knows a common error with this please help! Rep ++!</description>
