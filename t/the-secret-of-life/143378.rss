    <title>The Secret of Life</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/the-secret-of-life/143378</link>
    <description>It&#39;s really kind of ironic how I heard of this.

I had just got off the phone with my aunt, and was feeling a little philosophical(I always do when I talk to her), and was wondering about the universe. Then, out of nowhere, I decided to call a friend that I hadn&#39;t called in a while. She told me her and her boyfriend were just talking about me, and were going to call. After about 15 minutes of talking, and we ran out of things to catch up on, she asked me if I had ever heard of a documentary called the secret. I told her no, and asked her what it was about. She told me that the secret was a three step process to get anything you want in life. I really disregarded it, and we just went on talking for a little bit than we got off the phone.

Over the next day or so, the secret crossed my mind, I mean, it was kind of intriguing, get anything you want in three steps, who wouldn&#39;t want to know it. Well, I went to my friends house, and she had to take a shower before her 
boyfriend came to pick us up, so I talked to her mom, she&#39;s a really great lady. Anyways, her husband has a KICKASS computer, so we always chill in the den because she always fucks it up somehow, anyways, back on topic, I was sitting on the couch and realized there was a book on the end table, called the secret. So, I ask her about it, and she told me that it&#39;s probably one of the best things she has ever learned, and that she had applied it in life before, without knowing it.

I just watched the documentary for the first time today, and after learning more about it, realized the connection between the occurrences. Anyways, it&#39;s a really good watch, check it out...

This is the link to watch the documentary. Be aware that it&#39;s not hosted on mopar, and that I&#39;m not responsible for you getting in trouble for watching it, anyways, here.

[url=http://tv-links.co.uk/video/9/5160/7720/50383/73471]The Secret[/url]

EDIT:
Sorry everyone. The site I use for it, redirects.

Simple alternative,

goto tv-links.co.uk
goto documentaries, search for the secret, watch, then come back and discuss.</description>
