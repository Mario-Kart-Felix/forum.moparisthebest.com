    <title>Need Run.Bat Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-run-bat-help/161494</link>
    <description>Ok well i havent had my server up in about 5 months and then i come and put my server up, did no steps and stuff and it worked fine.

Now today i tryed to put my server up and my friend said on MSN that he couldnt connect.

Usually it was the Run.Bat that was messed up and nobody could connect through it.

I Also have a wireless router so Idk.

If someone could give me a good Run.Bat file thatd be cool.
