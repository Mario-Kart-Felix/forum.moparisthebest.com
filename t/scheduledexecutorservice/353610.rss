    <title>ScheduledExecutorService</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/scheduledexecutorservice/353610</link>
    <description>[center][size=99pt][b]hello,[/b][/size][/center]
[b]Introduction[/b]
Before you read on, this isn&#39;t solely a Java tutorial. It is knowing and applying the ScheduledExecutorService class for uses on a common server.

[b]ScheduledExecutorService[/b]
What is this? This class is available in the [tt]java.util.concurrent[/tt] library and is a subclass of a ExecutorService that basically can schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically. [url=http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html]Read more[/url]...

[b]Example[/b]
This is an example since JDK 1.5:
[code=Java] import static java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.*;
 class BeeperControl {
    private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler = 
       Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);

    public void beepForAnHour() {
        final Runnable beeper = new Runnable() {
                public void run() { System.out.println(&quot;beep&quot;); }
            };
        final ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; beeperHandle = 
            scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS);
        scheduler.schedule(new Runnable() {
                public void run() { beeperHandle.cancel(true); }
            }, 60 * 60, SECONDS);
    }
 }[/code]

[b]Application[/b]
Now see how applying it to be a simple timed announcement works! I&#39;m comparing it against using the normal [tt]process()[/tt] method.

[code=java]import java.util.concurrent.*;

/**
 * See how the timed announcement works using
 * the ScheduledExecutorService.
 * (This is actually based on BeeperControl)
 *
 * @author Rix
 */
public class AnnouncementSchedule {

	/* Schedule instance. */
	private static ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
		Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);

	/**
	 * The main method (duh...)
	 *
	 * @param args	The arguments.
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// something to schedule at a rate
		// it will print out &quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!&quot;
		final Runnable announcement = new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				System.out.println(&quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!&quot;);
			}
		};
		// this schedules printing out &quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!&quot;
		// at a fixed rate
		final ScheduledFuture shout =
								// delay, interval, unit
			scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(announcement, 500, 500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
	}

}[/code]

[code=java]/**
 * A timed announcement using process()
 * like how it&#39;s used in winterLove servers.
 * 
 * @author Rix
 */
public class AnnouncementProcess {

	/* A flag to specify if the pseudoserver is offline */
	public boolean offline;

	/* The constructor. */
	public AnnouncementProcess() {
		while (!offline) {
			// the NanoTimer class is used as a timer (apparently)
			for (NanoTimer n = new NanoTimer();;) { // processes every 500ms
				for (int t = n.time((long) 500 * 1000000L); --t != -1; process());
			}
		}
	}

	/**
	 * The main method (duh...)
	 *
	 * @param args	The arguments.
	 */
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		AnnouncementProcess ap = new AnnouncementProcess(); // instantiates the constructor
	}

	/* The method called every 500ms */
	public void process() {
		System.out.println(&quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!&quot;); //prints &quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!&quot;
	}
}[/code]

These programs&#39; outputs would be, every 500ms:
[tt]ANNOUNCEMENT![/tt]

More importantly, we would want to know which uses more CPU. Running AnnouncementProcess averagely uses 0.9% of the CPU (see [url=http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd319/parawr/process.png]this[/url] picture for proof) but... AnnouncementSchedule uses 0.0% of the CPU (picture [url=http://i220.photobucket.com/albums/dd319/parawr/schedule.png]here[/url]) (by the way, I was using Java VisualVM if you were wondering)!!! You may want to try this on your own. Download the folder from http://uppit.com/ykhyvmtpk013/schedule.zip and see the results.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
ScheduledExecutorService &gt; Usual processing (although you can use event handlers... but IMO this is better for simpler tasks)

Hopefully you have learnt something from this tutorial. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

[b]Adding it in your server[/b]
For Davidi2 whose brain is a size of a pea and those who are still confused, here:
Declare this.
[code]	private static ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
		Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);[/code]

and this:
[code]	public static void announcement() {
		// something to schedule at a rate
		// it will print out &quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!&quot;
		final Runnable announcement = new Runnable() {
			public void run() {
				sendMessage(&quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!&quot;);
			}
		};
		// this schedules printing out &quot;ANNOUNCEMENT!&quot;
		// at a fixed rate
		final ScheduledFuture shout =
								// delay, interval, unit
			scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(announcement, 0, 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
	}

}[/code]

Then add this method under your welcome message (e.g. &quot;Welcome to Scape!&quot;).
[code]	announcement();[/code]

When you add this, the announcement is shown upon login and on an interval of 60 seconds after your login.</description>

To the incompetent Davidi2 who apparently knows how to add this to your own server yet encourages spoonfeeding to the community, I have included an example to be used in RSPS.<br>
[/quote]If you think I would ever want to add this to my server, you are sadly mistaken. I would rather use Grahams event manager. And BTW - It’s a tutorial. Basically the definition IS spoonfeeding. If you wanted this to be acceptable, you should have posted it in ‘General Programming’.[/quote]</p>
<p>Graham’s event manager has a tendency to throw a ConcurrentModificationException due to it being inefficient at managing adding/removing the events; The ScheduledExecutorService class and Blake’s Event Executor avoids this, and manages events much more efficiently.</p>
<p>Graham’s event manager also uses a list to contain events, whereas Blake’s uses a PriorityBlockingQueue which is much better for queuing events.</p>

Then what the hell are these tutorials for? Explaining more than what Java docs do, or demonstrating how they are applied in servers. Why don’t you go around a few Java tutorials posted here and say, “Sorry, these don’t explain more than the java docs” because all they do is explain what has been explained and also demonstrate the<br>
use in private servers. Your argument is fail. qq more - I haven’t seen you post any Java related tutorials.<br>
[/quote]Because most of the tutorials here are not explaining Java, they are explaining specifically how to add things to RSPS. The Javadocs don’t explain anything about RSPS specifically. The reason I only posted something like this on your thread, is because this tutorial is not about RSPS at ALL; at least not any more than the docs are. So tell me, what is the point? How is this better than the docs?<br>
[/quote]Are you retarded or blind? There are java related tutorials which have been posted by people; but they explain what has been in java docs and also demonstration of use in servers. What do you want? Me explaining more than what java has? That’s like arguing that 1+1 is 3 even though it’s 2. BTW, you only posted 2 tutorials - none of which are java related.[/quote]Exactly! That’s my point! <span class="bbcode-b">They demonstrate their use in servers</span>. Yours does not any more than a javadoc would. I have read almost every tutorial in this section, and all of the good ones are well explained, and if there is a javadoc on the topic they explain it much more in-depth, or server-specific. Please calm down.</p>
<p>BTW - I’ve written over 5 tutorials here, and I frequently help people in PM and in the help section. And you sound as if writing Java tutorials makes them better, when it does the opposite. People want SERVER tutorials, not java tutorials.</p>

<p>EDIT - So here are the ‘Rules and Regulations’ you are breaking:</p>
<p>[quote=“Taharok, post:1, topic:265742”]<span class="bbcode-b">When Posting a New Tutorial</span><br>
When you are posting a new tutorial, be sure that it covers all of the following:</p>
<p>[ul][li]It’s a tutorial relevant directly to RuneScape 2 Private Servers and nothing else.[/li]<br>
[li]Any code snippets provided have been thoroughly explained with careful detail.[/li]<br>
[li]You may post a tutorial that has already been created <span class="bbcode-i">if and only if</span> it surpasses any existing tutorials of its type.[/li][/ul][/quote]<br>
If you were to give a real server example, and explain what everything did, you would not be breaking any of those rules, because 1. It would be related to RSPS, 2. It would be explained, and 3. It couldn’t be compared to the JavaDocs because it would not be the same type of tutorial.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that the example you made is more complicated than the one in the JavaDocs.</p>
