    <title>The solution to campus crime</title>

    <description>First and foremost, an excerpt from the university&#39;s website:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Campus security enhanced with new projects
Monday 6 September 2010

The University of Newcastle has boosted its on-campus security with two new initiatives - the distribution of 6,500 personal safety whistles and the purchase of five state-of-the-art patrol bicycles.

The whistles, which will be handed out to staff and students, are the second loudest in the world. Each whistle produces a 120 decibel sound, which is comparable to the noise level of a jet engine.

As well as working as a personal alarm, each whistle features the security emergency number.

Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Services), Dr Sue Gould, said the whistle program was still at the pilot stage but if successful, more whistles would be purchased.

&quot;Whistles are one of the safest forms of personal protection - loud blasts from a whistle will let people know that you need help,&quot; she said.

The whistles are available from Student Services and Facilities Management buildings and will also be distributed to staff and students.

As part of the ongoing delivery of campus security, the University has also purchased five new patrol bicycles that will be used by security staff on the Central Coast and Callaghan campuses.

&quot;We recently ran a two-day training course in advanced bicycling techniques for 18 of our security guards, which was very successful. The security officers were taught numerous riding techniques, including how to ride safely down stairs,&quot; Dr Gould said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Before we begin, I regret to admit that I study at this university. It is a shit hole. Built on a swamp due to Australian ingenuity (who woulda thunk it?), it has about eighteen to twenty thousand students.

Anyway, for the last couple of years there has been increased criminal activity, much of it geared at ethnic students who are studying overseas here (Indian students, amongst others -- we also have a great deal of Asian students here, many of whom seem to be from South Korea; I did an assessment task with a few last semester).
So the university chooses to use a band-aid solution to a rather large problem -- they release &#39;rape whistles&#39;, whistles capable of emitting a blast in the 120 to 130 decibel range.
This is great save for a few reasons:
1. The campus is pretty big, as you&#39;d expect of a campus that has at least 15,000 students using it. Campus security, on the other hand, is rather small by comparison. Bilbo Baggins would describe it as &#39;butter stretched over too much bread&#39;.
2. Unlike American campus security, our security guards aren&#39;t armed with pistols, tasers, or pepper spray. The only guards in Australia that receive firearms for work-purposes are money transport guards (eg, our Armaguard service).
3. What the fuck is one security guard going to do in the event that he has an encounter with a gang of youths who may or may not be armed with knives which are easily concealable in the day, and even more concealable in the dark? Hell, what the fuck is he going to do even if they don&#39;t have weapons?

I only found out about this half hour ago, and I&#39;m so pissed off. Another half arsed solution by some dozy cocksucking bureaucrats that won&#39;t do anything besides wasting money.

Anyway, discuss. I&#39;m curious how Britain and Europe manage problems like this; I&#39;m already partially aware of the situation in America (ie, students can&#39;t open or conceal-carry in college/universities, but security guards open carry?).</description>

              <p>I guess being a neighbor to USA means a lot of guns are smuggled here. We have strict gun control laws, yet it seems most people own at least 1 illegal gun. They are very easy to buy illegally and I’ve even been offered by 17 year olds lol.</p>
<p>So now we got a bunch of kids or criminals carrying them, but a true law abiding citizen is still stuck with a hunting rifle. I live in a rural community, so this may not apply to all of Canada.</p>

</aside>
<p>While I agree it is unfortunate unarmed people do get attacked here(almost always by unarmed attackers), it doesn’t justify permits for guns unless guns are already accessible by the general public anyway. The only gun crime I know of that happened in south west England was back in 2008 where a father got shot not far from where I live, which was in a somewhat lower middle class area. (Read: 2 high rise council flats)</p>
<p>I had a pretty boring story written out but it read like it was written by an idiot(which isn’t far from the truth  ;D) but it’s easier to just summarize it, I know someone eligible to own a gun, given the current events that have happened recently, if he had a gun during any of the events he could EASILY have gotten himself or some unarmed punks killed. In 3 years under your criteria I could be eligible for a gun, not that I would ever feel the need to own one or that it would ever get to that point in this country, but giving a case for the argument I would definitely not do what I am implying, however what’s to say some criminal won’t offer me money for the gun? I could easily “lose” the gun or have it stolen from me. Imposing obligations to keep guns out of criminal hands can only be ritualistically enforced on to a force of kinds that do have to have proper training, the correct mental state, funding and equipment to…enforce…such obligations… The point I’m trying to get at is I do think it’s better for the police to carry and use guns rather than any old joe who has kept out of trouble for 21 years, I know it isn’t the most ideal situation but if the situation is that the country has very little gun crime and guns are not generally accessible to the public, such as the uk, either situation is not ideal.</p>

              <p>Concealed gun licenses increases the amount of guns on the street and accessibility to guns by the idiots LOADS. I was watching a police documentary who deal with gun crime in the UK, and a <span class="bbcode-b">large</span> find by them was defined by them finding 5 guns being smuggled into the country - that gives you an indication of the scale of the problem here.</p>
<p>Currently, it is very, very rare to find a gun here, I’ve never seen one that isn’t being held by a policeman and I’d like it to stay that way. I think the sacrifice of that 0.01% of defencelessness is worth it to ensure we don’t give the idiots that are most likely to misuse them easier access to them.</p>
<p>Also, all these mass shootings that you find in the USA aren’t typically done by those with history of mental illness, they’re considered socially a bit strange, the few examples that come to my head that is, but that isn’t a crime. The gun culture in the USA gives people access to guns far too easily, so even provided they don’t have a license - there is enough time to obtain one and do some harm with it.</p>

<p>I didn’t say anything about major problems with crime, we don’t have that here either, I asked what would the danger be in letting such a person carry a gun?  The way I look at it, just because there is a 99.99% chance that you could get through life without needing a gun for self defense doesn’t mean you should be deprived that right the other 0.01% of the time.</p>

<p>Be grateful Mopar, the limit here for civilians is 10 rounds per magazine. Curious about why they chose 31 as the arbitrary limit though, as opposed to 30 or 35.</p>

<p>my uni is only for smart people so crime is pretty low. theres also campus police in every residence building and a shuttle service at night if ur a pansy also all night classes end at same time so you walk home together in bunches</p>

<p>I’ll say it again: The people that the police have suspected or charged as responsible for the attacks on students are people who ARE NOT studying at the university.<br>
With that said, the night classes that I attend personally aren’t that big (ie, they’re tutorial or lab classes). I’m not sure that any lectures finish after 5pm.<br>
We have a shuttle too, don’t know how much use it gets.</p>
