    <title>PI exploits</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-exploits/447553</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been experimenting with some PI exploits such as item spawning, leveling, object clicking from any loc and i&#39;m aware their is an exploit in which a player can spawn an object(not item). I would assume that this would be performed in the client but I am a little confused... Does anybody know this exploit and show me how to do it?</description>
