    <title>Getting Your Compiler To Work (WINDOWS 7 ONLY)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/getting-your-compiler-to-work-windows-7-only/373950</link>
    <description>Hello,

For the last 2 days I have been trying to get Java to install and work and it was much trouble,

I did everything that it told me to do but still nothing.

If you want to compiler to work on your windows 7 computer do the following things:

1. Make Sure JDK Is Installed.

2. Once you have your source, Right click on the compiler and click edit In Notepad.

Now you should get something like this open up, Or Similar:

[code]@echo off
if exist &quot;%programfiles%\Java&quot; (call :compile &quot;%programfiles%\Java\&quot;) else (goto error)
:compile
for /D %%x in (&quot;%~1jdk*&quot;) do (set p=&quot;%%~x\bin\javac.exe&quot;)
if defined p (%p% -cp . *.java)
if defined p (goto end)
:error
echo You do not have Java installed. Please download it at the site that is about to load.
&quot;%programfiles%\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe&quot; http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
:end
echo Finished!
pause
exit[/code]

Now Heres The IMPORTANT BIT.

Most or all windows 7 users have 2 PROGRAM FILES FOLDERS.
Like this
Program Files
Program Files (x86)

Now, It is most likely that java is installed in program files (x86) so that means you MUST change the directory in the compiler By adding the (x86) at the end. So now it should go from:

Before:
%programfiles%\Java&quot; (call :compile &quot;%programfiles%\Java\&quot;) else (goto error)

After
%programfiles (x86)%\Java&quot; (call :compile &quot;%programfiles (x86)%\Java\&quot;) else (goto error)

See, all ive added is (x86) after program files.

Save and then test it and it should work fine.

Please this is sooo simple and easy to fix, if you cant do this, then clearly you shouldnt bother trying to code or anything like that,

Thank you!</description>
