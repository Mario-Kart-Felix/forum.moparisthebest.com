    <title>I don&#39;t know what to do with my economy</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/i-dont-know-what-to-do-with-my-economy/256396</link>
    <description>Well, I&#39;m using an Allstar-Scape base and the economy was bad. I made an attempt to fix it, but people got rares from no where and everything. I don&#39;t want to continue running the economy boster, so should I just let my economy go? 




Thanks.</description>
