    <title>Special Attack!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/special-attack/517733</link>
    <description>Alright, i didnt know what i should put in the title.

I want to add a special attack to primal rapier / other weapons.
Like the Player is using Forcechat than and shouting like &quot;RAAARGH!&quot; And then he has Super strength and is hitting fast like the Saradomin sword.

Could be amazing when someone links me to a simple snippet</description>
