    <description>For some reason on my server special attack isn&#39;t working anymore it used to work fine but after awhile I been doing updates and such and I have no idea what update effected it... when you do the spec it takes the amount for the spec but doesn&#39;t attack or display the animation nor emote for the attack and this comes up in the server .bat file.

I looked in the files for incorrect arrays and they all seem to be correct..</description>
