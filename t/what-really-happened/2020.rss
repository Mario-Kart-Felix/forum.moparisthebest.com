</aside>
<p>While I generally agree with this – though it’s more along the lines of them being anti-!them – it’s worth remembering that by US military standards, both the trade centers and the pentagon were entirely valid targets. The WTC buildings both housed offices for the state and/or defense departments, and the pentagon is, well, the pentagon.</p>
<p>As for the “72 virgins” nonsense, this is not believed by any rational muslim, nor is it to my knowledge anywhere in the Qu’ran or the Hadith. Westerners who somehow profess this as a tenet of Islam simply don’t know what they’re talking about. (Disclaimer: it very well might appear in some tangential parts of the Hadith, but it is openly acknowledged that these are at best fraudulent, and more likely outright lies)</p>
<p>Tangent:</p>
<p>As for the “oil motive,” it is not simply a matter of obtaining cheap and plentiful resources. This is, in fact, probably the <span class="bbcode-i">least</span> significant part of the equation. The neoliberal’s problem with Hussein was that he was purposely creating fluctuations in the market, which upsets people with significant investments in it – and many of those people just so happen to be either 1) members of the current administration, or 2) funders of the current administration. Which is not to say it’d be any different were a big-d-democrat to be in office. Both parties are equally culpable. This is very much the reason people like Chavez and Morales are pissing off our government so much; they are finding ways to undermine the power of the “free market,” which means a market which has been fixed to provide the business sector of the elite powers the best situation possible. It should be remembered that one of the Ba’ath party’s primary influences was Arab socialism; Hussein made every effort to nationalize the Iraqi oil industry – I don’t know if he ever succeeded, though. But the threat of that alone is enough to make the capitalists pee their pants. Quashing foreign investment is a big no-no in a world run by a handful of nations, the leaders of which are put into office by people with very deep pockets that never seem to be full enough.</p>

<p>Killing civilians doesn’t hurt the economy, and in the long term US economy, it probably helps.</p>

<p>Terrorists are anti-capitalism, they wanted to get their message across by killing many civilians. They didnt destroy it for the buildings, if that was the case they’d have gone after a famous monument such as the statue of liberty.</p>
<p>I don’t believe there is any conspiracy. If they really needed oil that bad, they could have just invaded Canada. Alberta has about the same amount of oil as Saudi Arabia, and many people forget that.</p>

          <blockquote>
              <p>0 characteristics of conspiracy theorists<br>
A useful guide by Donna Ferentes</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Arrogance. They are always fact-seekers, questioners, people who are trying to discover the truth: sceptics are always “sheep”, patsies for Messrs Bush and Blair etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relentlessness. They will always go on and on about a conspiracy no matter how little evidence they have to go on or how much of what they have is simply discredited. (Moreover, as per 1. above, even if you listen to them ninety-eight times, the ninety-ninth time, when you say “no thanks”, you’ll be called a “sheep” again.) Additionally, they have no capacity for precis whatsoever. They go on and on at enormous length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inability to answer questions. For people who loudly advertise their determination to the principle of questioning everything, they’re pretty poor at answering direct questions from sceptics about the claims that they make.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fondness for certain stock phrases. These include Cicero’s “cui bono?” (of which it can be said that Cicero understood the importance of having evidence to back it up) and Conan Doyle’s “once we have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however unlikely, must be the truth”. What these phrases have in common is that they are attempts to absolve themselves from any responsibility to produce positive, hard evidence themselves: you simply “eliminate the impossible” (i.e. say the official account can’t stand scrutiny) which means that the wild allegation of your choice, based on “cui bono?” (which is always the government) is therefore the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inability to employ or understand Occam’s Razor. Aided by the principle in 4. above, conspiracy theorists never notice that the small inconsistencies in the accounts which they reject are dwarfed by the enormous, gaping holes in logic, likelihood and evidence in any alternative account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inability to tell good evidence from bad. Conspiracy theorists have no place for peer-review, for scientific knowledge, for the respectability of sources. The fact that a claim has been made by anybody, anywhere, is enough for them to reproduce it and demand that the questions it raises be answered, as if intellectual enquiry were a matter of responding to every rumour. While they do this, of course, they will claim to have “open minds” and abuse the sceptics for apparently lacking same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inability to withdraw. It’s a rare day indeed when a conspiracy theorist admits that a claim they have made has turned out to be without foundation, whether it be the overall claim itself or any of the evidence produced to support it. Moreover they have a liking (see 3. above) for the technique of avoiding discussion of their claims by “swamping” - piling on a whole lot more material rather than respond to the objections sceptics make to the previous lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leaping to conclusions. Conspiracy theorists are very keen indeed to declare the “official” account totally discredited without having remotely enough cause so to do. Of course this enables them to wheel on the Conan Doyle quote as in 4. above. Small inconsistencies in the account of an event, small unanswered questions, small problems in timing of differences in procedure from previous events of the same kind are all more than adequate to declare the “official” account clearly and definitively discredited. It goes without saying that it is not necessary to prove that these inconsistencies are either relevant, or that they even definitely exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using previous conspiracies as evidence to support their claims. This argument invokes scandals like the Birmingham Six, the Bologna station bombings, the Zinoviev letter and so on in order to try and demonstrate that their conspiracy theory should be accorded some weight (because it’s â€œhappened beforeâ€.) They do not pause to reflect that the conspiracies they are touting are almost always far more unlikely and complicated than the real-life conspiracies with which they make comparison, or that the fact that something might potentially happen does not, in and of itself, make it anything other than extremely unlikely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s always a conspiracy. And it is, isn’t it? No sooner has the body been discovered, the bomb gone off, than the same people are producing the same old stuff, demanding that there are questions which need to be answered, at the same unbearable length. Because the most important thing about these people is that they are people entirely lacking in discrimination. They cannot tell a good theory from a bad one, they cannot tell good evidence from bad evidence and they cannot tell a good source from a bad one. And for that reason, they always come up with the same answer when they ask the same question.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A person who always says the same thing, and says it over and over again is, of course, commonly considered to be, if not a monomaniac, then at very least, a bore.</p>

<p>Wikipedia: conspiracy theory guide</p>
<ol>
<li>Initiated on the basis of limited, partial or circumstantial evidence;<br>
Conceived in reaction to media reports and images, as opposed to, for example, thorough knowledge of the relevant forensic evidence.</li>
<li>Addresses an event or process that has broad historical or emotional impact;<br>
Seeks to interpret a phenomenon which has near-universal interest and emotional significance, a story that may thus be of some compelling interest to a wide audience.</li>
<li>Reduces morally complex social phenomena to simple, immoral actions;<br>
Impersonal, institutional processes, especially errors and oversights, interpreted as malign, consciously intended and designed by immoral individuals.</li>
<li>Personifies complex social phenomena as powerful individual conspirators;<br>
Related to (3) but distinct from it, deduces the existence of powerful individual conspirators from the ‘impossibility’ that a chain of events lacked direction by a person.</li>
<li>Allots superhuman talents or resources to conspirators;<br>
May require conspirators to possess unique discipline, unrepentant resolve, advanced or unknown technology, uncommon psychological insight, historical foresight, unlimited resources, etc.</li>
<li>Key steps in argument rely on inductive, not deductive reasoning;<br>
Inductive steps are mistaken to bear as much confidence as deductive ones.</li>
<li>Appeals to ‘common sense’;<br>
Common sense steps substitute for the more robust, academically respectable methodologies available for investigating sociological and scientific phenomena.</li>
<li>Exhibits well-established logical and methodological fallacies;<br>
Formal and informal logical fallacies are readily identifiable among the key steps of the argument.</li>
<li>Is produced and circulated by ‘outsiders’, often anonymous, and generally lacking peer review;<br>
Story originates with a person who lacks any insider contact or knowledge, and enjoys popularity among persons who lack critical (especially technical) knowledge.</li>
<li>Is upheld by persons with demonstrably false conceptions of relevant science;<br>
At least some of the story’s believers believe it on the basis of a mistaken grasp of elementary scientific facts.</li>
<li>Enjoys zero credibility in expert communities;<br>
Academics and professionals tend to ignore the story, treating it as too frivolous to invest their time and risk their personal authority in disproving.</li>
<li>Rebuttals provided by experts are ignored or accommodated through elaborate new twists in the narrative;<br>
When experts do respond to the story with critical new evidence, the conspiracy is elaborated (sometimes to a spectacular degree) to discount the new evidence, often incorporating the rebuttal as a part of the conspiracy.’</li>

<p>The United States did not attack itself.  This was not a giant conspiracy orchestrated by the White House.  There were in fact people on all of the commuter jets, and there are in fact grieving families.  al Qaeda did in fact take responsibility for the attacks, and al Qaeda operatives were in fact captured in the United States, who under interrogation confirmed what we already knew, that it was in fact al Qaeda who performed the attacks.  The flight that crashed in Pennsylvania, as well as the other flights that crashed into the WTCs and (I think) the Pentagon all had people on board who called family members, saying that they had been hijacked.  I ask you, what diabolical purpose would compell the US government to sacrifice some of its personnel in addition to thousands of its citizens, and billions of its dollars, to provoke a war with a nation so backward that it OUTLAWS TELEVISION?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is nothing.</p>
<p>We were attacked by terrorists.  It was not a missile attack.  Many of these ‘eyewitnesses’ may in fact have seen only brief glimpses of it, or not really been paying attention when they saw the plane in flight.  None of them are professional forensics investigators, so they would have no idea at all what a plane crash would do to a building.  That’s like asking your friend at school to diagnose a disease - he can guess at it, but he really has no idea what the cause of illness is. [/quote]</p>
<p>VERY well put… and thank you, now I don’t have to say all that.</p>
