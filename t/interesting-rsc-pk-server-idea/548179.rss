    <description>godfrey ho&#39;s RAGE OF A NINJA

 THE GAME:

here is my insperation!

[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou9gsMfp46k#t=73[/youtube]                      
there are 2 scenes into the film that are NSFW. i only want you guys to watch the first 2 mins of it, just the first fighting scene (up to 2:22, anything after that; consider yourself warned) to understand the shittyness of the server.


make a server that is a stork server that has these things:

- the client cannot be downloaded, but the only way to play is on a web page webclient

- make ninja masks with ridiculous head bands :P

- add guns

- everywere is the wilderness

- players can select any item&#39;s color on a color wheel gui, for capes, rares, robes, ninja masks, ect. not equipment though.

- clear the map entirely, and make a minimal space needed map, with a tiny square island with ALL equipment spawns (potions, everything you need) and the spawns mentioned below. make a pking 
   island, and wave game, and ctf islands, and clan wars island. there is a small ring of water surrounding the main islands, the rest is a HUGE flat green plane for spawning things for the over powered players.

there is an aouto inventory fill area that fills the player inventory with best food.

- everyone starts at lvl 156 combat (max)

- rares are shit cheap (they spawn in a line on the ground next to capes, robes, and other customization shit)

- only full dragon, and that dark blue legendary armor is obtainable normally.

- you can gang up on one single player. there is no limit on how many people can fight one person all at the same time, this is the sptratedgy used to defeat the super player, or with gang range

- no one losses anything, even in wilderness/skull, or anything expect of corse in staking/trading

[b] here&#39;s the catch, there is ONE special special item in the entire game, it is the manual. everyone tries to get the manual through any means possible, wether pking, staking, trading, or clan wars. this item enables the person to take almost full control of the game, and becomes a lvl 1000, either spawning items, monsters, 3d objects, npcs, or anything they want, spells and missles/killing things, anything to kill a player can be used, they can spawn stuff anywere, but they will probably want to do it in the flat planes. (they can kill players. they cannot teleport, only to the flat lands). pretty much admin powers, there is no altering stats/invisibility/invincibily. real admin has full control, but will not stop players with the super item. [/b]
              
- autoing/hacking/botting is allowed entirely, no rules whatsover, only no spamming/flooding, this will get the person muted except through private chat.

- you can make your own clans, factions, and legions in order to take control of the super item.

- there is a safe room, where no one can spawn, or take control of, this room is for duels and sitting and talking.

BTW, the super player is called the ultimate ninja. The game is a fudgeing crap-shoot for the helling fun of it, so go ahead and flame, i dont care.
yeah, ill clean up/add things later, i have to go, im in a rush, c ya. :D</description>
