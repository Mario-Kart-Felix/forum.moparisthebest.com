    <title>::swim (::hail) command help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/swim-hail-command-help/337515</link>
    <description>hey guys ok you all know the command ::hail or ::zombie and so on.. the commands that make everybody the a certain emote you know.. ok so i added my own called ::swim which makes everyone swim lol (its funny) but the problem is, the emote is to short and i was wondering if anyone knew how to make it longer, i mean i know its not possible to make emote longer from here, but to somehow make it repeat its self like 3 times you know... here is the code i tried
[code]public void swim()
   {
for (Player p : server.playerHandler.players) {//loop so it effects all players
        client person = (client)p;
if(p != null &amp;&amp; person.distanceToPoint(absX, absY) &lt;= 5) {
client castOn = (client)p;//specific player&#39;s client
castOn.plrText = &quot;Everybody follow me now! Stroke!Stroke!Stroke!&quot;;
castOn.plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
castOn.TurnPlayerTo(absX, absY);
castOn.setAnimation(1502);
castOn.setAnimation(1502);
castOn.setAnimation(1502);
castOn.updateRequired = true;
castOn.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
       }
}
}[/code]

sadly it compiled but still it only did emote once and it was still to short, does anyone have any ideas how to make that emote repeat itself?</description>
