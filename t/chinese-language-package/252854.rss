    <title>Chinese Language Package?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/chinese-language-package/252854</link>
    <description>I&#39;m trying to download the Chinese version of Counter strike that I stole from an Asian kid from school. It always gets fucked up, and it shows gibberish. Anyone have the chinese language pack so that I can get a chinese friend to tell me what it says. 
If i manage to get the Chinese language pack can someone tell me how to translate it to enligh myself?</description>
