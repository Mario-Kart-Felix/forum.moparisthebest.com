    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-problem-that-i-think-only-moparscape-himself-can-fix/18120</link>
    <description>Whenever I load click runmoparscape, I get an error message in the bot that says: 

[URL=http://img49.imageshack.us/my.php?image=errordi5.png][IMG]http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/2691/errordi5.th.png[/img][/URL]

please help.... it was working before and thats how I ran the server. I want to delete .mpr_file_store_32 and reload the cache but the file is read only.
