    <title>[PI] createFrameVarSizeWord (somewhat) not sending</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-createframevarsizeword-somewhat-not-sending/533217</link>
    <description>While I&#39;m sure this in part has a lot to do with the client, I loaded an earlier build of my current client project (on which these had been working) and still found a few of them not sending.
In short, what&#39;s going on is that my clan chat and xp bar are not sending any text. Prior to whatever I fudged up, the clan chat was not working, however, the xp bar worked fine.

Going ahead and posting the only instances of said variations I have (for the ones that don&#39;t work):

[code]	public void sendSkillXP(int skillID, int xp) {
		if(c.getOutStream() != null &amp;&amp; c != null ) {
			c.outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(124);
			c.outStream.writeWord(skillID);
			c.outStream.writeWord(xp);
			c.outStream.endFrameVarSize();
		}
	}[/code]

[code]	public void sendClan(String name, String message, String clan, int rights) {
		outStream.createFrameVarSizeWord(217);
		outStream.writeString(name);
		outStream.writeString(message);
		outStream.writeString(clan);
		outStream.writeWord(rights);
		outStream.endFrameVarSize();
	}
[/code]

In the meantime, Frame126 and so on work perfectly fine.

I did some googling and read up on this, though admittedly still have a very limited understanding at this point.  Where should I begin when looking for a fix for this?
All help is appreciated, thanks.</description>
