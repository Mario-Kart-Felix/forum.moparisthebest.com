    <title>Items showing to others</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/items-showing-to-others/430210</link>
    <description>When somebody is killed either in pvm or even in pk the items aren&#39;t shown to another person, only to the person that died. I have no idea where to start to look into this problem can anybody point me towards the .java file or the method which needs to be looked at to solve this problem, i want items to appear after 60 secs if the person dies to a monster and the items to appear to the other person in pk but the person that died not to be able to see them for 60 seconds if they were the ones that got killed, thanks</description>

              <p>Very easy fix, give me the line in your PVP death method where the item is dropped on the ground – actually give me the whole method.</p>
