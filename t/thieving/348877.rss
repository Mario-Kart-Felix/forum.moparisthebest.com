    <description>I was wondering how I could make thieving stalls give out one of about 8 items randomly. Like you put in 8 item id&#39;s for it to give you, but it doesn&#39;t give you all of them at once, it will randomly give you them. Example: I click on the thieving stall, I get an emerald, I click on it again, I get a sapphire, I click it again, a diamond, and so on and so forth. Wondering if it&#39;s possible to do that. Thanks.</description>
