    <description>I apologize if some of the grammar is fucked, been out of school for a while :P

Just curious if anyone has further developed this source privately, and if so would like to know what you&#39;ve done. Jorgen (Ephemeral), I believe used this as a development base, thats non-dependant on MySQL (similar to EasyRSC). Uses the original 202MC, and from what i&#39;ve read from the release topic handles each thread (client) independantly instead of the multi-thread usage from the LS that the RSCDaemon v25 base uses (which is a CPU hog if anyone&#39;s used it). 

Also curious what the difference with area-handling is (somewhat still new at this) vs RSCDv25&#39;s with handling multiple entities at once in a viewed sector. After looking through a RSCDv25 client, it seems that it catches a lot of exceptions from misconstructed packets/and or memory limits surpassed. Anyways, I wish to try to develop this source further and would appreciate any feedback as to what could be done to improve it.</description>

              <p>The more Objects/Items/NPC’s/Players in a single area will cause the client to crash or DC because of the many Packets being sent but RSCDv25 is more secure then Varekd so Developing from that would be a step behind</p>

<p>Perhaps we could start a PRO/CON list. I just got a hold of Varekd (I believe Stork developed this), also caught my interest. I don’t know, like I said I’m still new at this, would be nice to look at each source and compare each other to see where the strengths and weaknesses are.</p>

<p>in RSCDv25 a Sector isn’t used for much at all, except for loading up the tiles upon initialization to set each tile’s landscape data (to stop wall-hacking, ranging through walls etc) It’s all based on single tiles, and a 16x16 tile list, each player has.</p>
<p>I can tell you that running RSCDv25 i had 560 players online, using around 50% cpu on the single threaded app. So right now that’s not a problem, theres memory leaks and lots of missing content/dupes/bugs in RSCDv25 (mostly small) but there.</p>

<p>Yeah thats the client bug, not the server like we have said hundreds of times. When you were online the time it takes to move, equip and anything else was normal. For some reason the client can’t handle 40+ players in one area. However when those 560 were online everyone was spread out with maybe 5 players in their area at max and nobody was really getting dced at all, at least who i talked too. But if your reffering to the events before that where there were 400 split over falador,varrock,lumbridge and draynor then yes.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: June 09, 2009, 11:30:43 am[/size][hr]</p><blockquote>I noticed in RSCDv25 if multiple mobs are all in a single area (lets say each doing something unique, whether chatting/fighting/etc) meanwhile the server is trying to update all those clients with the viewed entities, the client will start throwing exceptions?
<p>Another thing I noticed was the need to queue a lot of un-used services when the world is running, is this really needed for every client?</p>

<p>Hmm, I don’t like the fact that the server needs to run a check to multiple clients at once, I would think that causes some sort of disconnect domino effect. I think you may of mis-understood my question regarding sectors, I noticed in RSCDv25 if multiple mobs are all in a single area (lets say each doing something unique, whether chatting/fighting/etc) meanwhile the server is trying to update all those clients with the viewed entities, the client will start throwing exceptions?</p>
