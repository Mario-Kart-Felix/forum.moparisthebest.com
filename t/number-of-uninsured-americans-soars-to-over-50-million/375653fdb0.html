        <p>I’m really not going to make even a half assed post at this hour(and I’m only posting since I’m waiting for something), buuuuuuuuuuut damn right I’m going to point out where you contradicted yourself frell</p>
<p>firstly, you have “health care is expensive” as both for and against, and all I can say is of course health care is fucking expensive there’s no return on it and you cant expect people to restrict their personal freedoms so some other cunt can maximize profits</p>
<p>expanding on personal freedoms, you contradicted yourself by saying healthy people will have to support people who live unhealthy life styles, and go on to say its wrong to increase taxes on unhealthy substances because that restricts their freedoms, the contradiction being, tax increase or insurance cost increase people are still paying for the bad choices of others, but you’re against free healthcare because it will mean they’ll have to pay for their mistake (or something like that, I’ll elaborate if you wish)</p>
<p>you’re also against healthcare because from the way I read this, free healthcare is anti-competitive etc, this really isn’t the case because if private insurance is better(and from your no list I’m sure you think free health care will be terribad which only contributes to this argument, ) people will pay for it, which is why private insurance firms like bupa can operate in countries like the UK because they can specialize and give better treatment than a free option, get paid well for it, contribute to r&amp;d and all that good stuff without going bankrupt</p>
<p>4, 8, how so</p>
<p>also 10, 12, supply and demand bitch<br>
also 15 p. sure it doesnt work like that</p>
<p>correct me if I’m wrong but the only real arguments you have are: the government might fuck up, patients wont get care that competes with private insurance(keyword: competes, competition with private insurance) and the obvious economic drawbacks, and the way I see it the only thing that matters is patient care and its a big issue I agree, but the nhs(a benchmark I suppose) really isn’t that bad, its not private insurance good(yes we have those in the uk too) and it shouldn’t be but it sure beats no free health care hands down every time</p>

Hard to take it seriously when it uses long wait times as a reason.<br>
[/quote]<br>
How is that not a valid reason?[/quote]</p>
<p>because people who are dying or seriously injured/ill take priority obviously, and everyone who has to wait <span class="bbcode-u">waits because they can wait</span>, it’s not the other way around where people who cant wait end up waiting and suffer ill effects because of it</p>
<p>for example(I know you’re probably talking about weeks to months here but a small scale example works just as well), a person who cuts their arm visits an er, they get it patched up immediately so there’s no immediate medical issue, they then wait until a proper doctor is free to look at it and send them on their way, meaning if someone comes in with a serious head injury there will be doctors on hand so the other doctors wouldn’t have had to drop everything</p>
<p>also what thug says about long waits also very much applies</p>
<p>ps this was sort of a long post anyway but oh well I was originally planning on expanding into more detail and shit</p>

<p>I dont think im understanding this. This is where my idea of a blanket layer comes in, where buying private insurance is optional but still readily available. Obama wants to cut out private insurance companies and cap doctor salaries(are they capped in the UK?), and pretty much re-do the system to cover illegal immigrants also, along with more crap that makes this far from pure “universal healthcare”</p>

<p><span class="bbcode-b">4</span> " Government-controlled health care would lead to a decrease in patient flexibility. At first glance, it would appear universal health care would increase flexibility. After all, if government paid for everything under one plan, you could in theory go to any doctor. However, some controls are going to have to be put in to keep costs from exploding. For example, would “elective” surgeries such as breast implants, wart removal, hair restoration, and lasik eye surgery be covered? Then you may say, that’s easy, make patients pay for elective surgery. Although some procedures are obviously not needed, who decides what is elective and what is required? What about a breast reduction for back problems? What about a hysterectomy for fibroid problems? What about a nose job to fix a septum problem caused in an accident? Whenever you have government control of something, you have one item added to the equation that will most definitely screw things up–politics. Suddenly, every medical procedure and situation is going to come down to a political battle. The compromises that result will put in controls that limit patient options. The universal system in Canada forces patients to wait over 6 months for a routine pap smear. Canada residents will often go to the U.S. or offer additional money to get their health care needs taken care of. "</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">8</span> “Government-mandated procedures will likely reduce doctor flexibility and lead to poor patient care. When government controls things, politics always seep into the decision-making. Steps will have to be taken to keep costs under control. Rules will be put in place as to when doctors can perform certain expensive tests or when drugs can be given. Insurance companies are already tying the hands of doctors somewhat. Government influence will only make things worse, leading to decreased doctor flexibility and poor patient care.”</p>
<p>10&amp;12, how is that supply and demand?</p>
<p>15 is more of an opinionated one, not sure what thats about.</p>

Im not sure if we’re on the same boat. Here, yes in the ER there are priorities, but the longest waiting time is porbably a few minutes depending on how much of an emergency it is. My mother was having stomach pains and got a normal doctors appointment in a day, went there and they suspected the “possibility” of having gallstones (This was about when I left for school, so about 8). I was aware she was at a doctors appointment, but then i got a text message at lunch of my dad saying she just got out of surgery. Thats fast. Sure, her gallbladder may not have exploded for a week or a few more hours, but why risk it?</p>
<p>As for normal appointments, people usually arrange them themselves depending on how serious it is. Last year I had a severe sore throat and was able to get an appointment an hour after calling, simply by asking if you have any times available today.</p>
<p>If you are having headaches for a week, and you call the doctors in the UK or Aus for an appointment, how long are you waiting? (Serious question) 3-5 or more days? Even if its less, this number will not be proportional to the US at all. Its hard to believe it, but homeless people will hurt themselves for to be admitted to hospitals for free food and rest (prisoners already do it, because they’re healthcare is paid for by the government). Not to mention with the shortage of a new generation of doctors, this will leave a smaller professor generation. So in all you get more people in the hospitals, with less people to treat them.</p>

<p>Then what is the whole deal about longer wait times regarding? The ER? Wait, IIRC it only really shows up in surgery appointments.</p>
<p>Ive heard longer wait times always being discussed everywhere, but I’ve never actually known about the actual time (other than the commercial about the canadian who was told to wait 3 months for surgery for her brain tumor, so she came here).

        <p>I don’t know. But I can only imagine it is for very specialist stuff, even in surgery - I don’t hear of these waits. And having been under for quite a few, I haven’t experienced them either.</p>
<p>You have such a warped view on this whole thing. Emergency room, go in and they’ll sort you, the exact same way as you would.</p>
<p>I am not sure on how the Canadian system works, but wait times aren’t top of the list when it comes to problems with our healthcare system. It is usually them being overcrowded (which could lead to longer wait times, but it is usually just overcrowing on wards - people waiting in over night, not surgery), which is a fair and valid point - it is hard to keep on top of it, but there is a reason why we in Britain mostly, fiercely defend the NHS against foreign criticism, because many of us have benefitted greatly from it, and for what it is, it works pretty damn well.</p>

I probably do have a warped view on the wait times, as to the whole thing, watch doctor interviews from here in America, and also see how “warped” Obamas policy is. Remember, im fighting HIS policy, not universal healthcare. His policy is probably different than European universal healthcare systems</p>

        <p>Here in my home state you can be uninsured, walk into any hospital, and still get treatment. The hospital will then retroactively sign you up for the state subsidized insurance and you will most likely be covered for any basic treatment and only have to pay a small copay. I think it’s a good thing. The more socialization of medicine the better; society only moves as fast as its slowest member. Life is destined to work with itself to improve the lot of all living things as much as competition allows.</p>
<p>In the United States many poor people can’t afford insurance or people choose to go uninsured; that’s not the biggest problem with healthcare though. I think the current “Disease=Symptom” model of the Medicinal Field and how old age and death are looked upon as unnatural is a more serious problem. Care for the elderly and disabled such as Dialysis and hospice care represent a huge portion of medical expenses for the US, as do Administrative costs (most estimate at least 80% industry spending is on Administration).</p>

<p>If you are having headaches for a week, and you call the doctors in the UK or Aus for an appointment, how long are you waiting? (Serious question) 3-5 or more days? Even if its less, this number will not be proportional to the US at all. Its hard to believe it, but homeless people will hurt themselves for to be admitted to hospitals for free food and rest (prisoners already do it, because they’re healthcare is paid for by the government). Not to mention with the shortage of a new generation of doctors, this will leave a smaller professor generation. So in all you get more people in the hospitals, with less people to treat them.</p>

</aside>
<p>ill make a proper post later but, if you call your local gp you USUALLY can be seen the same day, and everytime we’ve had to go up we called 7-8am and were able to be seen by 12-1pm</p>
<p>and <span class="mention">@er</span> heh things are definitely different here, from the few times I’ve been to the er what will usually happen is if it needs immediate attention you’ll get it, then you’ll proceed to wait several hours(we were up there 6 hours when I broke my arm, inb4 shitstorm), when my brother was last up the er he was waiting about 10 mins(for me and my mum to arrive) before he got pain meds, maybe half an hour until an xray and got surgery the next day and this was for a particularly bad cut to the face which required several stitches and a few paper stitches. Granted our particular er is always pretty busy, I doubt it will be like that across much of the uk.</p>
<p>eEEEEEEEDeit: I imagine a lot of the complaining about wait times are the of the very long 2-4 week or more kind for specialized surgery, rather than 2-3 days for a gp appointment(which happens over busy times of the year).</p>

        <p>If you are in a life threatening situation, you get aid immediately (obviously). If not, then depending on your symptoms you might have to wait a few hours, or days if it doesn’t need immediate care. You can get free pain killers if you want, though, so the problems aren’t that big.</p>
<p>Besides, many diseases need testing to confirm, so you have to wait nonetheless. If you need a test that involves depositing a bottle of urine, you can do that and know the results tomorrow. A doctor doesn’t need to receive the cup in person, and he doesn’t do the tests either. Same with blood-tests. There are a lot of things people with lower educations than a doctor can do, which is cheaper and allows the doctor to do things only he can do.</p>
<p>If we feel ill all of the sudden, we have four options. We either call the doctor, and he’ll come by when he has time or we visit him. When it’s a bit more serious, there is a doctor waiting at the hospital, and when you give him a call you’re added to a list, and you’ll be visited the same day. You usually call this guy at night too. If you have problems that need immediate attention, you go to the ER yourself. If you feel like you are about to die, or any other serious problems, you ring 112 (European 911) and an Ambulance will arrive within 6-7 minutes.</p>

We do have waiting lists in this country for things such as transplants and very specialist surgery.[/quote]</p>
<p>Our waiting lists for transplants are very high, but that’s mostly due to the law and people not signing up as a donor. In the Netherlands you have to say ‘Yes I want to be a donor’, instead of the much better ‘No, I don’t want to be a donor’. If you are automatically a donor, and have to fill in a form to get yourself off the list, you are forced to consider it.</p>
<p>But there’s also a problem with the law. Last time I checked, relatives are asked if they want to donate the organs of a (almost) deceased person. Even if the dead person enlisted as a donor. People usually say no when they have to decide over the organs of relatives.</p>
<p>If you need specialist surgery, and it’s not available in the Netherlands, you are allowed to go to a different country and be operated there. It’s even (partially) compensated by insurance companies.</p>
