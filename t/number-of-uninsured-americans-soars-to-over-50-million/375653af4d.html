Actually, you’re right about the rubbish approach to organ donations. I’ve agreed to donate my organs on death (and this is listed on my driver’s licence), but plenty of people don’t.</p>
<p>It’s a big problem, because everyone that needs a transplant expects it soon enough to avoid death, yet they’re the same people (usually older and conservative people) who wouldn’t donate organs themselves.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>Some part in me says that the following would be a good rule: If you don’t donate, you don’t get a transplant yourself either.[/quote]<br>
Could possibly interfere with some gay religion. Or the risk of reusing a reused organ… ew</p>

</aside>
<p>I find that ridiculous personally. As a Canadian who has been the the ER many times, I can say it’s not that bad.</p>
<blockquote>My health-care prejudices crumbled not in the classroom but on the way to one. On a subzero Winnipeg morning in 1997, I cut across the hospital emergency room to shave a few minutes off my frigid commute. Swinging open the door, I stepped into a nightmare: the ER overflowed with elderly people on stretchers, waiting for admission. Some, it turned out, had waited five days. The air stank with sweat and urine.</blockquote>
<p>I’ve never even heard of such things. I do not know anyone with bad experiences even close to that. This isn’t a fair representation of Canadian health care. Sweat and urine? Maybe he was standing beside a fat guy who pissed himself. But hospitals are ALWAYS very clean.</p>
<p>3 days ago, I went to the ER because I have a flu and had breathing problems later at night. They took me instantly and prescribed me antibiotics because it turns out I have a lung infection.</p>
<p>One time when I was hit in the eye by a hockey puck, I had to wait a full 20 minutes. That kind of sucked I guess. But thankfully vision returned by that time anyways.</p>
<p>If you’re going because you have a sore finger, you can expect to wait a few hours. I broke both my wrists and had x-rays almost immediately and was fixed up within a few hours.</p>
<p>A few years ago I had a stomach ache. I went to the ER and told them that i had this horrible nauseating cramp for the past day. I saw the doctor instantly and it turned out I had appendicitis, which progressed into peritonitis. It was life threatening, so I got surgery, tonnes of drugs, and walked out for free 3 days later. Interestingly, my grandma in Florida had the exact same problem near the same time. She is a Canadian citizen but lives in Florida 6 months a year. When she went to the doctor in Florida, they didn’t diagnose her properly and she lived with it for a whole week. My 1 day was hell and became life threatening, so I can’t even imagine what she went through.</p>
<p>While in the hospital we thought she was on her death bed. Well they finally decided it was appendicitis, and wanted to charge her $700,000 dollars for surgery. Instead she was flown back to Canada by helicopter, which costed $20,000 and was later paid for by OHIP. She got her surgery done, but because of the fuck up in Florida, she had to get a large portion of her bowels removed, her ovaries, and many more. She had to recover in the hospital for a few months.</p>
<p>Horror stories are bound to exist for every system. But it’s honestly not that damn bad here.</p>

<p>Specialists are long waits yes. My eyebrows are falling out (alopecia), so I’m going to see a dermatologist. I have to wait until May and I made the appointment months ago.</p>
<p>I waited like 8 months because of knee problems once.</p>
<p>But I’d rather that, then some bill I absolutely could never afford.</p>

<p>I feel their pain, I haven’t been insured since I graduated college (may 09) and my wife hasn’t been insured since we got married.  …, which works alright (heartburn about once a week, on average).  I’m sure other people have an even harder time.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>are we really living in a modern society?, i know of third world countries, where education is free from grade 1 to University, and heathcare is also free. Also their emergency wait time it very very low, if you had to wait, they would attend to you and make sure you are given comfort, ex painkiller or etc.</p>
<p>I went to the emergency department last year, my fingers got cut by a machinery and i was in great pain, i had to wait for 5 hours, before they treated me to stop the pain. then another 1 hour to get treated.</p>

<p>but not when the dermatologist is a close family friend lol, i find that very helpful, i often go to them, so i don’t have to wait that long.</p>
<p>by did you hear about the Calgary man, who died because no one attended to him in the Emergency department for few days. Not to say Canadian health care system is bad, but it could be better.</p>

        <p>I’ve skim read the past few pages, seems to be a lot of waiting time talk. As someone whose experienced first hand the NHS GPs, NHS hospitals and a private hospital. I can definitely say most are right about the GP waiting times being non-existent. You’ll pretty much always get the appointment on the day, just have to wait when you get there because they’re always running 5-10 mins late.</p>
<p>Hospitals are a totally different story, ER waiting times are prioritised, so if you don’t have a head injury you’re not going to be seen for like an hour. So the trick is, even if you only broke your leg to mention the “throbbing pain” in your head <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) In terms of specialists at hospitals, or specialist clinics - these take GP referrals to get into because there are waiting lists. For instance Orthopaedics (for my spine) required a referral then about 2-3 months waiting before I could see a surgeon. When I saw the surgeon I had to wait around 1-2 hours for Xrays (again, xrays always have long ass waiting times) so eventually we just went private, which here in the UK is holy shit fast. A surgery that would have waited 2-3 years on the NHS or maybe not even happened took 1 year at a private hospital (by 1 year, I mean it took 1 year of meeting the orthopaedic surgeon before he decided I needed the surgery, then he booked it straight away).</p>
<p>My brother has the same problem Scoliosis (less severe) so he’s only on the NHS. He goes every year for a checkup and waits around 3 hours for Xrays then sees the doctor. I used to go every 6 months privately, upon arriving had Xrays within 20-30 minutes- then saw the surgeon. Like I said I only had to go twice (1 year) before they decided surgery.</p>
<p>NHS has good GP practices, but the hospitals could definitely be a little better.</p>
