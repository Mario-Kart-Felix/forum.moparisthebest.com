I agree with Yakman. I see no problem with the rich subsidising the poor when it comes to health care. I think the issue some Americans have with it is that it’s not as capitalistic as they’d like – damned socialists! :rolleyes:<br>
[/quote]<br>
When the rich have to pay for the poor it will only last until that generation of wealth is dead. Any newcomer planing to be _______ that needs to pay bills and debt and not have a chunk of their income go to helping people that may be leeching off the system will probably turn their head. Right now we have people cheating the system and living off of unemployment, welfare, and other entitlement programs that are meant to help people in need.</p>

<p>The US is a rich country. It has more wealth per person than say the UK or Germany, yet both of them have well-run universal healthcare which its citizens love.<br>
Since I compared wealth per person, arguments like “The US has a large population!” hold no water.[/quote]<br>
We <span class="bbcode-s">have</span> <span class="bbcode-b">had</span>(we’ve substituted it with other crap) money because we don’t fall for that. Funny you mentioned two countries trying to get out of National Healthcare or looking for solutions to keep it going so they can counter the soaring debt.<br>

<p>Of course the citizens are going to love it, they arent paying for it! - oh wait, they have to pay very high amounts of taxes and wait for service (whered the canadian prime minister go for heart surgery?) I also doubt they “love” it. They would probably admit it could be better. Either way, thats no way to look at this. Everyone would love to not work, so lets have them not work!</p>

You’re right, there is. Take out the people who know nothing about the bill other than that it insures them, take out the activists that support the bill solely for their effort to help people in need - no matter what, and you’ll see theres more people against it for valid reasons. If we take out the people all together and look at the government, theres an effort to push it through, but theres efforts from the same and opposite party to stop it. Does this mean no one wants to help people? No… this means we need to find a better way of doing so.</p>

        <p>The government did pass a healthcare bill recently, too bad its completely useless (does nothing to get healthcare to those who don’t have it, like my family), and its already been declared unconstitutional by at least one district court judge.</p>
<p>I’m not an expert, and I don’t know what’s best, but I know something needs done. I’ve heard good and bad things about canada’s system, maybe something like that would work well here. I don’t see any reason the USA couldn’t pull it off if canada can.</p>

<p>Theres more problems with national healthcare other than just paying for it. We shouldn’t reform the system, just add a blanket coverage layer for everyone who doesn’t qualify or cant afford it, but we can’t do what Obama wants to do and shutout private insurance companies and cap doctor salaries. This will also effect R&amp;D and slow the whole worlds medical advancement progression. Alot of the profit from these companies go to experimenting with more medicine and inventing tools and supplies.</p>
<p>Protip: It would be cheaper to buy everyone in America coverage instead of reforming the whole system. And we get to keep our doctors and wont discourage anyone with plans.</p>
<p>People outside of America tend to forget that alot of companies here provide healthcare coverage and dental coverage to their employees. Speljohan did not know this, so there are probably a few more of you. But this isn’t true for the straight out of highschool or quick money jobs like fast food, waiter, etc. I believe its management and above or has to count as a career.</p>

<p>As Mopman pointed out there’s really no organized effort in the uk against the NHS except perhaps a bunch of (unwarranted?) complaining which leaves the INF, and the only reason they’re against the NHS is because the uk supposedly borrows money from them to pay off debt, and the NHS causes debt. INF will gain from the privatization of the NHS and lose if it remains public, a completely opposite stance from every uk citizen who uses the NHS.</p>

<p>From what I can tell all that would do is make rich insurance companies richer(from public tax money no doubt) and wouldn’t really fix the problems of refusing people because of preexisting conditions and shit like that.</p>
<p>What would be a protip is just force private insurance companies to pay x towards a public insurance company(along with public money) and have everyone without insurance be default into that, shit I know you’re going to say “but they’ll run off to another country” but half the world already has public healthcare.

<p>Actually that is not what I would say. I would say that this will just mess with the free market system. These insurance companies are taking their own gamble to try and make money.

<p>Oh this again. I hear it recited on Fox news quite a bit. No one is disputing that the US has some of the best healthcare in the world, and if you can afford it, it is great. That isn’t the problem, the problem is getting healthcare to everyone.</p>
<p>As for the whole debt thing. There is a reason, beyond that of just wanting to ensure the NHS keeps its standards, that the government have been trying their hardest to dance around the NHS in regards to budget cuts. They know the debt isn’t down to the NHS and can be solved with the NHS largely intact.</p>
<p>I know the whole Fox news thing got old a while ago, but it is now that I see the same arguments, pulled in by you, that Fox news has used in the past. It is hilarious, they have that guy from Britain come on every time healthcare comes up to shout about the NHS “THE US DOESNT NEED IT, THE UK HATES IT”.</p>
<p>Same with this thing with Margaret thatcher, which I think is funny, because the US into all this sort of stuff. Supporting the businesses that keep your country alive, she stopped all that, and the results were shown in the mass unemployment that came after her decisions.</p>

<p>Who pays for the ‘blanket coverage for those who don’t qualify or can’t afford it’?  It surely will lose quite a bit of money, so it definitely can’t be done in the private sector and would have to be paid for with tax dollars, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Also, the prohibitive cost of insurance isn’t the entire issue.  Like I said before, my wife and I CAN’T buy private insurance regardless of the amount, due to a ‘pre-existing condition’.  If I made millions of dollars a year, I still could not buy insurance because no one would sell it to me, period.  (if I made that much though, I guess I might be able to pay for my own health care, so maybe the solution is to just give all those who can’t get insurance millions of dollars a year? <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongueae52.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> (obvious sarcasm))</p>

<p>It’s updated every time we pass an amendment to it, which is extremely hard to do since it requires a popular vote from the whole nation, as it should be.  It hasn’t changed much over time though, because you don’t fix what isn’t broken. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/winkae52.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

(whered the canadian prime minister go for heart surgery?)<br>

<p>Oh this again. I hear it recited on Fox news quite a bit. No one is disputing that the US has some of the best healthcare in the world, and if you can afford it, it is great. That isn’t the problem, the problem is getting healthcare to everyone.</p>
<p>As for the whole debt thing. There is a reason, beyond that of just wanting to ensure the NHS keeps its standards, that the government have been trying their hardest to dance around the NHS in regards to budget cuts. They know the debt isn’t down to the NHS and can be solved with the NHS largely intact.</p>
<p>I know the whole Fox news thing got old a while ago, but it is now that I see the same arguments, pulled in by you, that Fox news has used in the past. It is hilarious, they have that guy from Britain come on every time healthcare comes up to shout about the NHS “THE US DOESNT NEED IT, THE UK HATES IT”.</p>
<p>Same with this thing with Margaret thatcher, which I think is funny, because the US into all this sort of stuff. Supporting the businesses that keep your country alive, she stopped all that, and the results were shown in the mass unemployment that came after her decisions.[/quote]<br>
I had actually heard that argument from someone else and then googled it, IIRC he came to America because the Canadian system was going to make him wait, forgot that there might be less heart surgeons in Canada.</p>

You missed my part about filtering out and redefining the current entitlement programs so the blanket layer would be possible.</p>
