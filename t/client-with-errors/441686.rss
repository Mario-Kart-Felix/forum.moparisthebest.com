    <title>Client, with errors</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-with-errors/441686</link>
    <description>Is it possible that a single &quot;(&quot; could cause 100 errors? The majority of the errors I am getting are Illegal start of expression, which makes me think it could be.

I&#39;ve recently extracted a client and then decompiled the client.class, when compiling it gives me 100 errors, now my first thought would be it would be a bracket? So I checked the number of brackets and they add up fine, I checked the number of parentheses and there is ONE extra &quot;(&quot; than &quot;)&quot;. 

Could this be the problem?

If not, then why am I getting 100 errors when compiling, the file hasn&#39;t been modified in any way and it&#39;s come straight from the client.</description>
