    <title>Looking for a ::help command</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-a-help-command/261534</link>
    <description>Hey, does anyone know of, or have, a ::help command that when used in-game, contacts any admins or mods online that someone has issued this command, so that they can help them, whatever their problem could be?

Thanks!</description>
