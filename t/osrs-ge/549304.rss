    <description>Did they really get 75% vote for this? I was like what the hell when a friend told me....

I mean correct me if I am wrong I don&#39;t keep up with the osrs updates much but wasn&#39;t the GE one of the MAIN reasons people wanted to go back?</description>

</aside>
<p>OSRS currently has 46k online. To say 72k people don’t play is silly, even before the game gained population when F2P came. Again, I never said people from RS3 didn’t vote, <span class="bbcode-i">because that wouldn’t mean anything</span>. If RS3 players voted because they wanted a feature in OSRS to start playing, <span class="bbcode-i">that is completely fine and legitimate</span>.</p>
<p>[quote=“the elve age, post:42, topic:549304”]This is fudgeing Runescape man, there’s no sources or websites that give you facts on any of their game data and there isn’t a definite number. Why would the people who don’t play OSRS have any reason to vote on an OSRS unless they’re benefitting on RS3?[/quote]Actually, if there was something fishy going on, it would be a scandal and you would find information. It’s just that youtubers and rs3 players voting to add a feature to the game isn’t fishy. And the reason is clear, as I already said. They voted because they wanted a feature in the game that would encourage them to play. Or because they thought it would make the game better for the people that do play (which is what youtubers would have been saying). There doesn’t always need to be a conspiracy.</p>

<p>It’s speculations on my part, and many people that I’ve played and chatted with that the Grand Exchange voting was rigged. The 3x voters is fishy, and you’re too hard headed to see that and instead you want to win another pointless argument on Moparscape (similar to how you “have to be right” on your development page).</p>

              <p>That’s not what I asked for sources for. I never doubted that three times as many people voted on that poll, like I said it is to be expected that something as big as that is going to get more votes.</p>
<p>What you didn’t provide sources for are your assumptions:<br>
A) Because 3x as many people voted,  the extra voters are people that don’t even play the game (basically this assumption is that everyone that plays always voted on the other polls)<br>
B) The 17k voters who voted no were all people that currently play the game (if so many people voted that don’t play the game, how do you know they didn’t vote no?)<br>
C) People getting paid to vote yes (not an assumption, but a claim I’d like to see a source for, at least one that would have made an impact on the vote)</p>
<p>Lastly, just because youtubers created videos to convince people to go out and vote, that isn’t vote manipulation. That’s simply like advertisements on the TV like any election. There were options on both sides, youtubers could have just as easily created videos saying to vote no, but they realized that it was a needed update. Maybe people weren’t playing BECAUSE there wasn’t a GE? Also worth noting that with this update, you pointed out in your new thread that the game has picked up in popularity. Perhaps some of those people that didn’t play before voted on the poll and now are joining because they really wanted the update?</p>

The votes are way off. Most of the people I’ve talked to in OSRS feel like the voting was rigged. Sparcmac and other known Youtubers were swaying their viewers to vote yes to the G.E. There were almost 3x as many voters than any other poll OSRS has had.<br>
[/quote]So you’re saying some popular youtubers agreed that the GE was a good idea and their viewers agreed with them as well and decided to vote as well? Obviously a hugely important update is going to get more votes than the average, especially with all the youtubers bringing attention to it.<br>
[/quote]Not really. Players were getting paid to vote the G.E. regardless if it effected them or not. SparcMac convinced RS3 players that the Grand Exchange was a “huge and important update that had to be in OSRS”. It was a small percentage of people that actually play game who voted for it; like I said, it was heavily swayed and the majority of the OSRS population who play voted against it.<br>
[/quote]I’d really like to see sources for these claims[/quote]Okay.</p>
<p>I don’t feel like taking pictures to prove it to you but I looked through the polls to check.</p>
<p>Grand exchange poll votes WITH 300 total level restriction: 72,385 votes</p>
<p>I looked through 5 different CONTENT polls during 2014 and the average votes was:<br>

<p>= 23,846.2 on average of voters</p>
<p>72,385 votes divided by 23,846.2 = 3.035</p>
<p>Three times as many voters voted for G.E. Like I said. The 23k players who actually play the game, were against it. (17k votes NO against the G.E)</p>

The votes are way off. Most of the people I’ve talked to in OSRS feel like the voting was rigged. Sparcmac and other known Youtubers were swaying their viewers to vote yes to the G.E. There were almost 3x as many voters than any other poll OSRS has had.<br>

Obviously a hugely important update is going to get more votes than the average, especially with all the youtubers bringing attention to it.[/quote]Not really. Players were getting paid to vote the G.E. regardless if it effected them or not. SparcMac convinced RS3 players that the Grand Exchange was a “huge and important update that had to be in OSRS”. It was a small percentage of people that actually play game who voted for it; like I said, it was heavily swayed and the majority of the OSRS population who play voted against it.</p>

[/quote]Yea, trading is part of the game. GE is a way to trade. If I didn’t like trading in the sense of making ironman, why would I want a GE? I just think that this logic:</p>

</aside>
<p>is retarded. Something stupidly inconvenient and poorly designed shouldn’t be considered a game “feature” and then complained about when it’s fixed. Hence why it got over a 75% vote. And it’s not like the GE makes items magically appear. Someone still needs to put in the effort to get hard to obtain items, and will charge a lot for it because of it. It’s just you don’t need to pay absurd amounts or wait hours to get the items that should be easy to get anyway.[/quote]</p>

<p>Good, that’s one of the flaws with NOT having the GE. You have characters that can log into and get materials from any world, but can only sell on one at once? Horrible design. Pick one: lock characters to one world or allow easy trading across worlds.</p>

<p>It was <span class="bbcode-i">an</span> element. Just because it was the only way to do something at one time doesn’t mean it was the best way. With that logic, we’d still be using horse drawn carriages instead of cars and abacuses instead of calculators. Some people may enjoy the novelty of those things, but the majority of people recognize the advantages of new technology.</p>
<p>[quote=“reyx7, post:22, topic:549304”]The GE makes prices in the market to “set” and allows less mobility with prices.[/quote]So? Having a market value or less fluidity for something is not strictly a pro or con, it is just a change. But I think you’ll find there are already market prices out there from sites like zybez that people use.</p>
<p>[quote=“reyx7, post:22, topic:549304”]Considering how easy the GE is to use, there atleast needs to be some sort of tax implemented, perhaps 5-10%.[/quote]I don’t really see the logic behind “its easy, better tax it”, but I agree that adding a tax to any sort of in-game auction house is a nice money sink that can help slow inflation. I don’t see it as a requirement though.</p>

If you want to sell 10k maples and do a quest, you shouldn’t be able to do those things at the exact same time without some sort of restriction in place.[/quote]Why shouldn’t I be able to sell items and do a quest at the same time? You’re using that logic under the impression that it should be a requirement to have to sell items in person. That is your opinion, one that is not held by most of the community. Most people don’t consider sitting in a bank spamming advertisements to be playing the game, so all it does is take away from your enjoyment. Just because everyone did it before (because they were required to) doesn’t mean it needs to always be a requirement.</p>
<p>tl;dr - It’s already been shown by community votes that people didn’t want to just do a remake of what RuneScape was in 2007. They wanted a do-over or rewind, where they can help shape the game from a previous point rather than have to go through the bad updates that killed the game. Basing an argument on the opinion that “its the way it was before, thats how it should stay” isn’t going to change minds, because the vote shows that people DO want it to change.</p>

              <p>It’s pulling items from all worlds though. Face to face trading is DEAD with the GE. It was an important element of this game for years. The GE makes prices in the market to “set” and allows less mobility with prices. Considering how easy the GE is to use, there atleast needs to be some sort of tax implemented, perhaps 5-10%. Time is money. If you want to sell 10k maples and do a quest, you shouldn’t be able to do those things at the exact same time without some sort of restriction in place.</p>
