<p>What you didn’t provide sources for are your assumptions:<br>
A) Because 3x as many people voted,  the extra voters are people that don’t even play the game (basically this assumption is that everyone that plays always voted on the other polls)<br>
B) The 17k voters who voted no were all people that currently play the game (if so many people voted that don’t play the game, how do you know they didn’t vote no?)<br>
C) People getting paid to vote yes (not an assumption, but a claim I’d like to see a source for, at least one that would have made an impact on the vote)</p>
<p>Lastly, just because youtubers created videos to convince people to go out and vote, that isn’t vote manipulation. That’s simply like advertisements on the TV like any election. There were options on both sides, youtubers could have just as easily created videos saying to vote no, but they realized that it was a needed update. Maybe people weren’t playing BECAUSE there wasn’t a GE? Also worth noting that with this update, you pointed out in your new thread that the game has picked up in popularity. Perhaps some of those people that didn’t play before voted on the poll and now are joining because they really wanted the update?</p>

        <p>How is it to big expected? 72k players don’t even play OSRS, so where did those votes come from? It’s obvious RS3 players came on and voted.</p>
<p>This is fucking Runescape man, there’s no sources or websites that give you facts on any of their game data and there isn’t a definite number. Why would the people who don’t play OSRS have any reason to vote on an OSRS unless they’re benefitting on RS3?</p>
<p>It’s speculations on my part, and many people that I’ve played and chatted with that the Grand Exchange voting was rigged. The 3x voters is fishy, and you’re too hard headed to see that and instead you want to win another pointless argument on Moparscape (similar to how you “have to be right” on your development page).</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>OSRS currently has 46k online. To say 72k people don’t play is silly, even before the game gained population when F2P came. Again, I never said people from RS3 didn’t vote, <span class="bbcode-i">because that wouldn’t mean anything</span>. If RS3 players voted because they wanted a feature in OSRS to start playing, <span class="bbcode-i">that is completely fine and legitimate</span>.</p>
<p>[quote=“the elve age, post:42, topic:549304”]This is fudgeing Runescape man, there’s no sources or websites that give you facts on any of their game data and there isn’t a definite number. Why would the people who don’t play OSRS have any reason to vote on an OSRS unless they’re benefitting on RS3?[/quote]Actually, if there was something fishy going on, it would be a scandal and you would find information. It’s just that youtubers and rs3 players voting to add a feature to the game isn’t fishy. And the reason is clear, as I already said. They voted because they wanted a feature in the game that would encourage them to play. Or because they thought it would make the game better for the people that do play (which is what youtubers would have been saying). There doesn’t always need to be a conspiracy.</p>

<p>You <span class="bbcode-b">asked</span> me to look at your response and respond? What did you expect? It’s not like posting the number of people that voted is proof that there’s shady business going on. Don’t take your saltiness out on me, I didn’t even vote.</p>
