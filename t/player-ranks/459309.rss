    <description>[center][size=24pt]Base: Project Insanity.[/size][/center]
Hello Moparscape users, I am trying to figure out how to make it where if a player has player rights of 0. That means they are banned from server. With doing this i&#39;d also need to understand how to make it where when a player logs in they instantly have a player rights of 1. (Witch makes then a normal player.)
Any assistance with this would be Greatly appreciated, thank you.</description>

<p>I think he plans to make another method to ban people, so now with the code he’s got provided he could do ::setrights 0 (user) or something like that to ban a user in-game; I don’t really see the point in this though.</p>

So why would you want to give them rights?</p>

Hello Moparscape users, I am trying to figure out how to make it where if a player has player rights of 0. That means they are banned from server. With doing this i’d also need to understand how to make it where when a player logs in they instantly have a player rights of 1. (Witch makes then a normal player.)<br>
Any assistance with this would be Greatly appreciated, thank you.</p>
