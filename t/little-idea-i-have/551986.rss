    <title>Little Idea I have</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/little-idea-i-have/551986</link>
    <description>I&#39;m currently working on a source. I was thinking of an idea to make a good server.
I was thinking of making it economy but with a little twist. You&#39;ll start of in a location and you&#39;ll have to start by earning cash by doing skilling things (Theiving will be hard) and once you make a certain amount of cash, you can pay staff ingame to be ranked up. Ranking up will allow you to start killing monsters and gaining more skills instead of doing skilling.

Each rank will contain different things.</description>

<li>What if no staff is online? Will I be forever stuck thieving?</li>
<li>What if the staff gets mad for no apparent reason and revokes my rank?</li>

<li>What if a staff will not rank me because they “don’t like me”?</li>

<p>Also, I don’t like this being the core concept of the overall server. While some players will find it cool and ‘enjoyable’ I can guaranty others will not.<br>
Maybe if it was part of the server, but not the core feature.<br>
Lets say you had to get 50 thieving and 1 million gp to unlock taverly…<br>
And then you had to get 500k while inside of taverly to gain access to the stores. Another 250k for access to their dungeon. Etc<br>
That would be something people would like - depending on the economy of the server, and of course, what was featured inside the areas.[/quote]<br>

              <p>It is interesting, but what happens when you unlocked everything? It sort of sounds like a quest-type sort of server. These servers are fun whilst there is unexplored content but once you’ve completed everything players quit.</p>
<p>If I were you, i’d make it sort of like a slayer-esk type of server. You talk to some guy who provides you with a task to do (skilling, killing a certain monster, pk people etc) and the player must do these tasks in order to maybe level up, receive an item, receive a perk (double xp for 1 day) etc etc. That way people will always have something to do and the server concept is more long-term.</p>
<p>It is good to see you atleast thinking of unique concepts other than the crap being “made” as we speak.</p>

              <p>I’m currently working on a source. I was thinking of an idea to make a good server.<br>
I was thinking of making it economy but with a little twist. You’ll start of in a location and you’ll have to start by earning cash by doing skilling things (Theiving will be hard) and once you make a certain amount of cash, you can pay staff ingame to be ranked up. Ranking up will allow you to start killing monsters and gaining more skills instead of doing skilling.</p>
<p>Each rank will contain different things.</p>
