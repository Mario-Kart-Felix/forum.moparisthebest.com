Inspired by Motherload, the last &#39;Console Game&#39; I&#39;ll ever make. I am currently up to Milestone 2 of the game. Would you like to hear the story? Here you go:

You are a miner, an ordinary miner. Hired by a not so well known company -- Goldentooth Co.
You live a dangerous life, having to dive down into caves hundreds of meters deep...
Your goal is to bring wealth and fame to you and your company and turn this small company into a huge enterprise.
Now, your mission is tough, however, you will achieve it... someday.

Urm, so yeah, I THINK the intro sums it up. I am sure some of you here might think &#39;MEH, TEXT GAME, BLARGH&#39; well, I&#39;m only 13 :( and please PLEASE show some support on my work.
The game is Open-Source, you may fork it on GitHub, I belong to a organization (Meh, my friends anyways) called QnDFoundations. And here is the GitHub Link: https://github.com/QnDFoundations/Mine-O-Poly

If you would like to suppert my work, follow me on github, and I&#39;ll work harder to bring you the BEST (if not the second best, or third, WHATEVER) text game out there. BTW, my github username is DeathJockey.

You can also see my development time lapses on youtube (Subscribe 4 more :D) :

Timelapse 3: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jY-Fy4lqwY
Timelapse 2 (Soz about the friggin watermark) : 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32_xxMBtpPM
Timelapse 1: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEg9Oo7ZO9E

I&#39;m very sorry that there aren&#39;t any images yet. I&#39;ll add them once I dig deeper into the game. Thanks 4 your support (If you are supporting it) and I&#39;ll check back later :D

BTW.  I am 13.... I know its hard to believe :(</description>

              <p>I’m not quite the Java programmer but I do know that you can easily use a library like slick2D for your “graphics” and combine your existing code with that to make for a better game.</p>
<p>For instance, in console, you need to choose an option, hit enter, and that calls a function.</p>
<p>In a 2D game, you would have to click on something in order to call the same function.</p>
<p>The function says the same, the way to call it is different. That’s pretty much the major difference if you’re going to port your game to a 2D environment.</p>

I am so glad with all your support, MistaBigBoss, Lin, TehRealBingleBob and all the others. I have made a major update to Mine O’Poly and it is now finished its milestone 2 phase.</p>
<p>The new contents are:</p>
<p>-Ore Related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three different tiers of ores, the normal tier has a complete generation and mining code.</li>
<li>Three tiers of ores have its own name and worth.</li>
<li>Mining takes time depending on the tier of Pickaxe you have. For example, wood pick break stone slower than stone pick</li>
<li>Some ores require a certain tier of pick to mine</li>
<li>Rare ores and Easter eggs awaits you!</li>
<li>The deeper you are in a mine, the more ore you can detect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mine Related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each tier of Pickaxe have durability</li>
<li>Deeper you are in a cave, the risk of explosions, dangerous gases increases, these ‘hazards’ slow you down and sometimes poison you causing you cannot mine for an amount of time</li>
<li>higher tiers of Pick breaks ores faster</li>
</ul>
<p>Miner related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inventory has 50 slots ( 0 to 49)</li>
<li>Fame sometimes give you special events such as someone donating money to your company</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s all for the newest updates, a lot isn’t it? Well this game is about 6.7 hours of work and im still working on it. Thank you’d for all your support and I’ll bring some more updates soon! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"><br>

Well uh, anyways we are sort of getting off topic. I am currently working on the mining feature. I’m sure some of you guys saw someone on YouTube called TehRealBingleBob and he is making a game called the punished (You can see it in the arcade board), this game is very similar to his, except you have a goal, and it’s going to be much better.</p>
<p>The mining feature will be quite complicated as there are Randomly Generated Caverns and some actions you take can risk your life…</p>
<p>Mining requires detectors, they assist you to find more ores. Higher tier can find special ores, right now there are 3 types of ore family:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal</li>
<li>Enchanted</li>
<li>Oblivion</li>
</ul>
<p>You mine the ores at different levels in the cave. Some ores require a certain tier of pick to break, and often lower tiers pick take longer to break a certain ore…<br>
Well that’s enough of my blargh blah, what do you guys think? Any suggestions? I think I should be able to do mostly anything you guys ask.<br>
[/quote]</p>
<p>NICE! I’m glad someone watched my videos… haha This sounds like it will be pretty awesome, I wish you good luck on your project!  :D[/quote]I watched like all your video’s…</p>

<p>Thanks, I’ve been working on it for a good 5 days now and it is almost ready for Alpha. Just need to add a couple of functions and uh… fix some (By some I mean just a little bit <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) bugs.

<p>Mining requires detectors, they assist you to find more ores. Higher tier can find special ores, right now there are 3 types of ore family:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal</li>
<li>Enchanted</li>

</ul>
<p>You mine the ores at different levels in the cave. Some ores require a certain tier of pick to break, and often lower tiers pick take longer to break a certain ore…<br>
Well that’s enough of my blargh blah, what do you guys think? Any suggestions? I think I should be able to do mostly anything you guys ask.[/quote]</p>
<p>NICE! I’m glad someone watched my videos… haha This sounds like it will be pretty awesome, I wish you good luck on your project!  <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>

You must be some sort of genius. Only 13?</p>

<p>C++, Year 11 maths, 3D MAX and stuff like that. I’m often excluded in RL because they all call me a nerd :([/quote]I was the same way. When I was 11 I had started C++ and was in the top of all my classes. Except I wasn’t called a nerd or made fun of it. I’m sorry about that.</p>
