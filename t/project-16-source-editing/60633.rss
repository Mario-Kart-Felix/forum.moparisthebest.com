    <description>any help on this soucre would be greatly appreciated.. i know im asking alot, but i cant do much on java


ok, i want to remove all these commands:
::barrows (gives you barrows to wear or sell)
::cw (Takes you to castle wars lobby
::gopk (Takes you to wildy pking area)
::tele -X cords- -Y cords- (Teleports to cords)
::range, ::mage, ::melee (range/mage/melee items)
::fly (PEmote Fly/Hover)
::cannon (heheheh, cannon lol)
::leet (Gives you ultimate pking stuff)

i want to know how to make it so attacking dummies gives 50 attack/strength/defence exp for each and
so people can only attack them up to 50 combat lvl

i want peopel to start off wearing
bronze chainbody    bronze spear    wooden shield    bronze med helm     bronze platelegs

i want to know how to make new shops anywhere that sell what i want them to

i want to delete npcs that are there already

i want the magic casting speed lower (right now you cast a teleport every time you click it)

i want it so you need to have so many mage lvls to use a magic, and runes are required to cast

i want the saradomin/guthix/zamorak staff to give infinite of all runes

i want peopel without admin rights to not be able to ::noclip

how do i get the sound effects for attacking and stuff in</description>

              <p>Instead of removing all commands rename to ridiculous number portions. (which I did), by looking at your requests you’re server is aspiring to the same goal as mine. Project 16 usually has much more reasonable coding, instead of most server like Sillyscape or something where npcs are running around everywhere and stuff. I want a server much like that of real runescape. :D, where the rules all apply, but ya know… yeah anyway here’s the stuff I think I could help you with, and suggestions for stuff I can’t.</p>
<pre><code>[size=8pt]&lt;blockquote&gt;}
                   if (command.startsWith("234223432432")) {

			addItem(2581,1);
			addItem(2491,1);
			addItem(2497,1);
			addItem(2503,1);
			addItem(4212,1);
			addItem(2577,1);
				}
			 if (command.startsWith("2422342332")) {

			addItem(3755,1);

			addItem(4714,1);
			addItem(4675,1);
			addItem(1727,1);
			addItem(3840,1);
				}&lt;/blockquote&gt;[/size] For Example
</code></pre>
<p>Next the dummy</p>
<blockquote>case 823:		
if (actionTimer == 0) {
sendMessage("You attack the dummy.");
setAnimation(0x326);
addSkillXP((50[0]), 0);
addSkillXP((50[3]), 3);
addSkillXP((50[18]), 18);
actionTimer = 12;
}
break;</blockquote>
<p>There’s a tutorial for the starting off items. don’t be lazy. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Also theres a tutorial for shops, but the short part would be /cfg/shops.cfg = edit a current one.</p>
<p>go to /cfg/autospawn.cfg and delete the one from the list you don’t want. for instance i want to get rid of the armour salesman. so I would erase the highlighted line below and save the .cfg</p>
<blockquote>//------NpcID---CoordX--CoordY--Height--RangeX1-RangeY1-RangeX2-RangeY2-WalkType-Descrption
spawn = 2619	2447	5178	0	2450	5181	2444	5175	2	TzHaar-Ket-Zuh
spawn = 2619	2412	5108	0	0	0	0	0	1	TzHaar-Ket-Zuh
spawn = 368	3263	3407	0	0	0	0	0	1	Varrock Gate Guard at Magic Shop
spawn = 1834	3170	3176	0	0	0	0	0	1	Lumbridge Swamp Candle Seller
[glow=red,2,300]spawn = 682	2667	3436	0	2667	3437	2665	3435	1	Armour Salesman[/glow]</blockquote>
<p>That goes a little to indepth for me, i don’t work on magic or items much. I’m more of a world object person. I like editting the map itself. try the tutorials or moparscape help section.</p>
<p>Again same with the casting speed thing… No idea about magic.</p>
<p>Not sure, but I think it’d be something like… Asterisks are just general Item IDs, i.e. the staff and runes.</p>
<blockquote>}
if (playerHasItemAmount(****, 1)==true) // God Staff Saradom
{
addItem(***, 1000000);
addItem(***, 1000000);
addItem(***, 1000000);
addItem(***, 1000000);
addItem(***, 1000000);
addItem(***, 1000000);
}</blockquote>
<blockquote>}
else if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("noclip") &amp;&amp; playerRights &lt;= 2) {
{
sendMessage("Cheater n00b"); 
}</blockquote>
<p>I don’t really think there is way, at least with current clients/servers to limit noclip, except to say that you can set an option to appendtobanned, or disconnected = true, when typed, however it will apply to you also.</p>
<p>Make a custom client that has all the sounds from runescape, then program your server to trigger those sounds at appropriate times or measures.</p>
<p>I hope this has helped you even slightly. I’m trying to get back into the habit of helping others learn while I learn also. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> enjoy.</p>
