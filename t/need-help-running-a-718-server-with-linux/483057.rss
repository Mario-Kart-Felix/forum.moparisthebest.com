    <title>Need help running a 718 server with Linux</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/need-help-running-a-718-server-with-linux/483057</link>
    <description>Windows works fine and runs just great

however I want to convert over to Linux (Ubuntu)


I tried getting the run server to run but... No luck...


I only had somewhat luck running it in wine but it wouldn&#39;t load anything that had to do with java...



So... my question is how can i get this working with Linux?



Here are my run.sh files


[code]
@echo off
title Server
echo Launching Server...
#!/bin/bash
cd /host/Users/Dillon/Downloads/Bens Project/Ben&#39;s Project/Ben&#39;s Project/
&quot;/home/dillon/jdk1.7.0_13/bin/java&quot; -Xmx1024m -cp bin;lib/*; com.rs.Launcher true true true
