Actually no. My server is set so when someone logs in for the first time they receive their pack then it labels it in their character file “starter = 1” or something like that and the server will then check their account when they log in again and it’ll see that they already have received their pack.[/quote]<br>
Most servers handle it like that, I was saying he should fix the ip problem instead of using it like that.<br>
It’s like cleaning your room and dumping everything under your bed, it will work, but the problem is still there</p>

              <p>I’ve actually gotten this error on my server before. It was annoying as hell but thankfully went away after a while. It happens because of problems with your router. If this problem persists, try getting a new one.</p>
