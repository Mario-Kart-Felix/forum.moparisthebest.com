              <p>I suspect that successful botting (i.e., getting away with it) would do well to avoid invasive approaches such as BCEL/ASM bytecode injection.<br>
What you’re really after, besides a reasonable level of programming prowess, is an understanding of computer vision. However computer vision is still in its infancy academically, which I guess is where the challenge lies when it comes to producing any kind of system that could be considered robust.</p>
<p>Previous attempts at vision based bots have typically existed within the context of colour-coded environments. Specifically, a programmer (or the end user of the script) provides the colour palette to the software, and the vision capabilities of said software are only as stable as the colours used within the game.<br>
Any kind of noise, or colour changes that fall outside of an acceptable threshold, usually results in failure of the bot. In short, the solution isn’t robust.</p>
<p>Operating within the context of a colour coded environment isn’t a bad thing. In fact, many of the university Robocup teams (if not all of them) still program their robots, in terms of vision/image processing, to operate within a colour coded environment. A friend of mine wrote a paper about ball detection in a colour coded environment: <a href="http://www.davidbudden.com/research/ball-detection/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.davidbudden.com/research/ball-detection/</a><br>
The difference is that Robocup competitors don’t have to deal with defensive changes to the colour palette that they deal with during a game. The team provides the bot with the ball colour, field colour, line colour, and goal post colours (goal post colours will be ditched in a few years, so the robots will be required to self-orient in some other manner), and tolerances (for things like minute lighting changes) – and these don’t change.</p>
<p>The ideal approach, at least according to some people I’ve spoken to, would be shape recognition. This is a lot more complicated, but it makes a lot of sense when you think about it.<br>
For example, people recognise cars as cars not because they’re maroon/green/blue/white/black but because of their shape.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Not to be discouraging, but if you use invasive approaches to botting then you’re going to have a bad time.</p>
