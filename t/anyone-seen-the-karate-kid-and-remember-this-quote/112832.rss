    <description>a character in that film says something like this
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Miyagi: &quot;listen Daniel-san, you have learned defensive blocks while painting my fence&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
thats just after the main character gets fed up of doing all the gardening, painting the fence and sweeping the floor, then that other character tells him that

does anyone remember the [b]exact[/b] words of that?
i need it to make an analogy about how what i teach is useful even if people dont see why right now</description>
