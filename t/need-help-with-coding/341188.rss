    <description>well my server is up and running online, but its plain! and there you cant get slayer up.

the source is very old it is funscap3.

and it is very plain. and i wanted to add some cool things to it to make it better. because right now its boring because noone is coming to it, because its plain.

ive seen some where its just all pking with easy commands and training. and ive even seen some with admin rooms and mod rooms.
can someone help me code some stuff onto my server? thanks.</description>

              <p>you should make seperate topics for every subject your working with.<br>
Infact, you should try coding yourself and when you run into an error or trouble, etc, ask for help in this section.</p>
<p>training easily can be done by adjusting experience.</p>
<p>mod rooms and admin rooms take coding. Making walls, objects, items, only for staff. this can be worked with the:</p>
<p><code>
&amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 1) {</code><br>
this works if the playerRights of a character is bigger than or equal to 1.  0=normal 1=mod 2=admin 3=owner</p>
