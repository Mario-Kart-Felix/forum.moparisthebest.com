    <title>Hyperion Password Help</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/hyperion-password-help/425578</link>
    <description>Okay, so I&#39;ve come across an unusual situation.

[URL=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/41/94469436.png/][IMG]http://img41.imageshack.us/img41/8462/94469436.png[/img][/URL]

Now I don&#39;t want to start inviting players to come play the server and have this happen because at the moment I can only resolve it by deleting the character file.

The file is in .dat format so if I edit the file (open it with notepad it&#39;s no longer compatible with the server). I&#39;ve been trying pieces of code to change the password for me upon log in but nothing has worked (kind of like the same way I would set player rights upon log in).

I also have no idea what is flagging this, and obviously I can&#39;t log in to ::change pass, and there&#39;s no website connected to the server.

Any ideas/thoughts appreciated. I&#39;ll be using trial and error until I come up with something.</description>

              <p>I fixed it, here’s a quote I posted on someone elses help topic:</p>
<p>[QUOTE=The Outsider;3024184]Hello, I had this same problem but found the source of the problem. Not sure if you still need this information but I think it’s worth the post as I was Googling the issue and come across your thread:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">package org.hyperion.rs2.GenericWorldLoader;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">if(f.exists()) {
			try {
				InputStream is = new GZIPInputStream(new FileInputStream(f));
				String name = Streams.readRS2String(is);
				String pass = Streams.readRS2String(is);
				if(!name.equals(NameUtils.formatName(pd.getName()))) {
					code = 3;
				}
				if(!pass.equals(pd.getPassword())) {
					code = 3;
				}
			} catch(IOException ex) {
				code = 11;
			}
		}</code></pre>
<p>This is where it’s all happening, and:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">} catch(IOException ex) {
				code = 11;
			}</code></pre>
<p>is the code that returns the “we suspect someone knows your password” flag. Now I’m not sure what is actually causing the server to flag accounts as hijacked, but it pretty much renders the server un-playable because players will be constantly getting reset.</p>
<p>Commenting out //code= 11; let’s me log in, but resets the account. I’m now looking into a cheap fix where I return “code = 2” instead, so it loads the characters file up in case of an exception, but this may cause unforseen security issues.</p>
<p>My theory though, is that if it returns as an exception, and therefore before it was code = 11; then all we want to do is login so players who have the wrong password, are banned etc. will still return their necessary codes to prevent unauthorized logins.</p>
<p>I’ll test it out for a while and let you know if there are any problems, that is if you’re still about and reading this.</p>
