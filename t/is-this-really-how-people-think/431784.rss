<p>I understand this point, but I’ve given up on trying to change the monopoly that is called the “run for president”. Simply my opinion. I don’t want facts shoved down my throat. Maybe I’ll care a bit more after college and it starts effecting me drastically.</p>

Like almost all of them didn’t even know how many stars were on our flag, or how many states we have… When I was in Elementary School I knew this stuff. I had been watching all the political stuff since 2000 when George Bush was going to run. I caught an interest there, and this just amazes me… These are High School students and they don’t know the basic history of our Country. They couldn’t even tell how many countries boarders ours. The one kid said “There’s too many.” You can’t count to 2?<br>

<p>You know, it’s probably the same people saying “Obama for president! 2012!” But they don’t even know who our Vice President is.</p>

<p>Like are people really that stupid? Or was this video set up?</p>
<p>Looks pretty real, and I find it funny that like 75% of the people do not even know who our Vice President is.</p>
