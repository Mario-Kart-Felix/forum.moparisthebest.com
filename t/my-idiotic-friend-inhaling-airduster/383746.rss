    <title>My idiotic friend (inhaling airduster)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-idiotic-friend-inhaling-airduster/383746</link>
    <description>Well my friend and I were driving tonight at around midnight and he was already a bit drunk because he is an idiot but he got some canned air from where he worked and decided it would be a good idea to inhale it. This guy already had major drug problems before and had been through rehab but it didn&#39;t seem to help him. Anyways I had never really heard about what it could do and I assumed that he was just inhaling some compressed air and it didn&#39;t seem to affect him at first so I was just like whatever (I had never been around anybody that has been high before). So I get onto the interstate and he breaths in a huge amount of this shit and he holds it in and is fine for about 2 seconds he manages to say something but then looks like he was going into fucking cardiac arrest then he just laid sideways not breathing at all and looked fucking dead. I was slightly yelling his name asking him if he was alright but no response. I was scared shitless because I had no idea what was going on. Then I just fucking hit him on the chest as hard as I can seeing if I can get some fresh oxygen in him and he finally comes around saying all this weird shit about the music and other shit. Then he justs spits a huge wad on my passenger window (at which point I was pissed off). Anyways I took him back to his car and pretty much let him stumble to whatever his fate was and took off. I got home and started researching this shit and it seems it is fucking horrible (can kill you brain cells, can stop your heart, can stop your body from functioning) ... can kill you.

TLTR: How fucking stupid is inhaling an airduster and have you done it?</description>

<p>He wasn’t intoxicated to the point where he couldn’t drink or drive anymore seeing that he drank before he went to work and this was midnight, the high off of air duster lasts only 2-3 minutes if you survive it, and his house was up the road and there were no cars out at this time of night. I wasn’t going to fuck around with explaining to his parents why he was drinking and getting high off air duster and wasn’t going to argue with him on the way there. Me dropping him him off at home wouldn’t have stopped him from walking to his car up the road and driving anyway.</p>

<p>Difluoroethane<br>
The practice of huffing canned air can be extremely dangerous or fatal. The intentional inhalation of 1,1-difluoroethane caused a fatal cardiac arrhythmia in a 42 year-old man. Several reports of fatal car crashes have been linked to drivers huffing 1,1-difluoroethane</p>
<p>Tetrafluoroethane<br>
[…]However, its gaseous form is denser than air, and will displace air in the lungs. This can result in asphyxiation if excessively inhaled. This is what contributes to most deaths by inhalant abuse.</p>
