              <p>It’s when you use the internet trough a “portal”, for example, you and your friend have a computer, your friends IP is buddy and your IP is guy, when you visit a site, the owner of that site will see a computer connected to his server/site with an IP called guy wich he can use to track you.</p>
<p>Now imagine if your friend set up a proxy server, and you can connect to that proxy and visit the internet from there, basicly a protocol of letting you visit the internet through his internet. So when you visit a website, it will say a computer with the IP guy is connected while your IP is buddy but since you’re using the internet of your friend to connect to the website by using his proxy server, the server sees your friends computer and not yours.</p>
<p>That’s as simple as I can explain it.</p>

<blockquote>In computer networks, a proxy server is a server (a computer system or an application) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource, available from a different server. The proxy server evaluates the request according to its filtering rules. For example, it may filter traffic by IP address or protocol. If the request is validated by the filter, the proxy provides the resource by connecting to the relevant server and requesting the service on behalf of the client. A proxy server may optionally alter the client's request or the server's response, and sometimes it may serve the request without contacting the specified server. In this case, it 'caches' responses from the remote server, and returns subsequent requests for the same content directly.
The proxy concept was invented in the early days of distributed systems[1] as a way to simplify and control their complexity. Today, most proxies are a web proxy, allowing access to content on the World Wide Web.
A proxy server has a large variety of potential purposes, including:
To keep machines behind it anonymous (mainly for security).[2]
To speed up access to resources (using caching). Web proxies are commonly used to cache web pages from a web server.[3]
To apply access policy to network services or content, e.g. to block undesired sites.
To log / audit usage, i.e. to provide company employee Internet usage reporting.
To bypass security / parental controls.
To scan transmitted content for malware before delivery.
To scan outbound content, e.g., for data leak protection.
To circumvent regional restrictions.
To allow a web site to make web requests to externally hosted resources (e.g. images, music files, etc.) when cross-domain restrictions prohibit the web site from linking directly to the outside domains.
A proxy server that passes requests and responses unmodified is usually called a gateway or sometimes tunneling proxy.
A proxy server can be placed in the user's local computer or at various points between the user and the destination servers on the Internet.
A reverse proxy is (usually) an Internet-facing proxy used as a front-end to control and protect access to a server on a private network, commonly also performing tasks such as load-balancing, authentication, decryption or caching.</blockquote>
