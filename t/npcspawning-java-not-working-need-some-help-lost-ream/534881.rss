    <title>NPCSpawning.java not working, need some help! Lost-Ream</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/npcspawning-java-not-working-need-some-help-lost-ream/534881</link>
    <description>Hi all, I&#39;m working on the lost-realm 718 source and whenever I try and spawn an object or npc it doesnt spawn:/

World.spawnObject(new WorldObject(47120, 10, 0, 1827, 5097, 0), true);

That should spawn Altar of Zaros at Dream land (Creating a new donator zone) but after compiling it doesn&#39;t spawn, could anybody help? This also doesn&#39;t spawn NPC&#39;s too.. 

All feedback will be taken on board! Thanks</description>
