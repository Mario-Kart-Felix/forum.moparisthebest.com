    <title>[PI] Need a Fishing Tut Please!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-need-a-fishing-tut-please/438799</link>
    <description>Ok so my fishing on my source wasn&#39;t working at all. when i would click the ripples to start fishing, nothing would happen. i decided to delete fishing from my server completely so i could find a tutorial to give my server better fishing. once i deleted it, i look online for a tutorial for about 2 hours.. i tried maybe 3 of them and none worked. if someone can make my fishing work then i will pay you $5 via paypal! i want it to work at catherby fishing area ! thanks!
also, i have temaviewer if u want to add the fishing yourself. (for an easy $5)
