However, booty, it seems, is in the vision of the beholder.Dropping pants may not escape the laws regarding gravity, but do they defy the law with the land?“If they reveal parts of the human structure that should not be exposed in a public setting, then they’re in violation of the law,” claims Ronnie Trahan of the Opelousas Louisiana Law enforcement officials Department, where people who fashion the dropping look can be fined $50 under indecent exposure legal guidelines.  In New Iberia, to the south, the city council may take things one step further by enacting a law to specifically address just what it considers to be a point out of undress. “I’ve been mooned,” says city councilman Louis Brownish, who may have seen too much from his front porch. “You can easily wear your sagging pants, just use the baggy trousers the way they are supposed to always be worn, north of the border. If you put them on south of the border them you’re not considering correctly or operating correctly.” Mooning can be eclipsed under the recommended law which prohibits underwear showing everywhere - a plan the ACLU says goes much. “We don’t need the government selecting for us what’s questionable and what’s not necessarily,” says Joe Cook of the Louisiana ACLU.
