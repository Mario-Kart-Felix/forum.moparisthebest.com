    <title>Trying to set so client/server work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trying-to-set-so-client-server-work/223680</link>
    <description>ok well heres the deal

i downloaded a client off of silab and i got testscape for a server. if i run my client in its folder and i run the runserver, i get the ip, then when i put in my IP adress(im not playing worldwide like quite yet, i want to set things up) my client goes towards loading all of testscape stuff...i dont want testscape&#39;s crap, i want to use my client information...

another thing ive tried was to put the runserver in to my client folder, but when i do that it get CLASS script errors, about 7 and them and my server wont run. 

so in short what can i do to make my client run insted of testscapes own crap (which in alot of way has to much)</description>

              <p>i said i downloaded a client…its not mine, well i guess since i  edited its mine. But thats not the topic point</p>
<p>i said, i downloaded testscape as a server, my client that i edited has a couple of erros, and heres a picture if you want some more help on what im talking about</p>

<p>by the way, im useing that big compile thing thats the perfect compiler will all these commands, now when i press run it comes up with errors and i cant run the client. but when i click the run button, i can run the client untill it askes to log in, then i get an error saying it cant connect…</p>
<p>thats any clearer?</p>
