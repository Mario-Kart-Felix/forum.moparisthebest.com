This is for those who currently run RSCD_v25 and desire to convert their player database over to the &quot;LEFTYS RSCD NO FORUMS&quot; source.
&quot;Leftys RSCD No Forums&quot; source is technically RSCD_v25 except that it&#39;s database resembles what the DEMONIK source used. Sick of the insecure, outdated, and overall crappy PunBB forum that your forced to use in order to have RSCD_v25? Convert to RSCD NO FORUMS!

&lt;&gt;With the RSCD NO FORUMS source, lots of bugs found in RSCD_v25 have been fixed, especially all the broken ladders.
&lt;&gt;Players are no longer linked by an owner, thus do not share bank accounts with each other.
&lt;&gt;Forum software like Invision Power Board allows external &quot;on fail&quot; authentication for log ins. This is how DARScape is able to register players and then allow users to login to the forum with the same username and password.
&lt;&gt;Friends/Ignores/Logins table conversion files not included as friends/ignores converters are buggy and the Logins table converter is too server intensive and not very important.
&lt;&gt;The convertBanks.php converter did not cause any problems when I ran it, but I cannot remember if it replicates a copy of the bank for each player that was previously under the same owner or if it only gives it to one of them. I believe the only giving bank to one of the players under the forum owner was what happened though.
&lt;&gt;Credits to my friend Nightwing767/Smicks/Steven who doesn&#39;t have anything to do with private servers or Runescape anymore.

Directions:

1. Extract/upload the PHP files to your website.

2. Edit the top of each file:

[code]// Log in
mysql_connect(&quot;localhost&quot;, &quot;username&quot;, &quot;password&quot;) or die(mysql_error());
mysql_select_db(&quot;database&quot;) or die(mysql_error());
[/code]

3. *You may have to tweak your php.ini file to allow for longer timeouts or the scripts will not finish and timeout midway. You will know it is done with the queries when the page finishes loading. Make a backup of your database before attempting a conversion in case there is a problem.

4. Run each file one at a time.

I will not support this release. Do not ask for help.</description>

              <p>It’s not Lefty’s… Most of that frontend site was in the RSCDv4 release by Reines on reinet. That was the “April’s Fools” site for when he said he replicated his own RSC server. Eventually when he got a working server up (set stats, spawn items, etc) he had the download link to the client on that page.</p>
