Where do you get a cheat client? Are they safe?<br>
[/quote]<br>
Thats the thing, you can’t really get one. All you can do is have it send packets to the server, and make it seem like you have stuff you don’t. For example, my client has one cheat in it to crack a fake Christmas Cracker on someone, but the servers never check if you really have a cracker so I can go around making Party Hats.<br>
But as far as I know there’s not many easy to get “cheat” clients.[/quote]<br>
I made my own.<br>
The only packets I could really do shit with is the items on players packet (as you said, useful),<br>
the magic on npcs and players packet (the one for npcs is very useful because you can sometimes hit the npcs when they are dead, and if there isn’t a timer you can repeatedly hit them by autoing ::mnpc index spellID), the attack npcs and players packet (hit people from far away with a bow, same with the magic packet!), and the item on object packet (They usually don’t require you to be anywhere near the object, you just use it from anywhere).<br>
Oh, and if servers use glory amulets the alternative item option packet.</p>
<p>I forgot an important one; the magic on items packet for alching.<br>
This eliminates the purpose of using the item on player packet if they check your items or using a cracker on a player does nothing, but the item on player packet is uber 1337ness if it’s the other way around.</p>

Your playerRights are set server-side, so cheat clients won’t do anything. Like xx qwertyuiop xx said, it has nothing to do with the freakin server!</p>
<p>Anyway…<br>
It probably isn’t really a hacker. There are loads of commands in server’s that the owner won’t know about. For example there was a command in many sources that made the player an admin, and IP-banning on todays servers almost never works.</p>
