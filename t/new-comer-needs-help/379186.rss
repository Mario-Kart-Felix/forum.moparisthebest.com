    <description>Hey guys/girls, 

Well today i wanted to make a rsps 525 server. So i downloaded a client and a source. But i found out it was a hmachi server. So i found it a bit difficult to code and see what files a which.
So i need help coding shops, Npc&#39;s monsters and all that stuff.

Here are the issuses the server has :

1. It has no NPC&#39;s.- That means no shops, no nothing.
2. You can&#39;t trade in it, or follow - There&#39;s 2 walk here selections, instead of follow / walk here.
3. It has thye wildy ditch, But when i go into it i can&#39;t get out without teleing or ::nocliping/dieing.
4. Some item&#39;s are glitching and i can&#39;t spawn.
5.No monsters and when i spawn a NPC eg. Corpi can&#39;t attack him. I can&#39;t attack any monster or trade and shop keepers.

So that&#39;s basically it at the momentihave found out.So if someone could post how to code shops in monsters in, items in and stuff that would be great. BTW i have the ZODIACREGIN LATEST PACK but i don&#39;t know what to do with it. - ME :S -

So if someone could send me link to a tut on making a hamachi server that would be great.

Thanks</description>

              <p>Trust me he is right you should definitly start out on a 317 server, all the files are rite there for you and easy to use. Its pretty basic but still a good start.</p>

              <p>NEVER EVER start on anything but a 317, oh god please, first, you wont be able to do anything and ask simple questions, and we are NOT a spoonfeeding community, and hamachi is horrible, portforwarding is better, trust me, no one will join your server if its hamachi, and if you do not have a router, just use utorrent…<br>
Start on delta imo, its the easiest, then go to PI, and move upwards…</p>
<p>That is all the help you need.</p>
