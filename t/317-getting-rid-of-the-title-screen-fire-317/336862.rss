    <title>[317] Getting Rid of the Title Screen Fire [317]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/317-getting-rid-of-the-title-screen-fire-317/336862</link>
    <description>This question in general makes me feel like a total idiot...
Can someone tell me how to get rid of that annoying fire on the title screen?
It&#39;s annoying when I change the title background and that fire doesn&#39;t go with it at all.
Thanks for the help. :)
I believe its a non-renamed client, if that makes a difference.
But just in case, can someone let me know how you can check? :P</description>

After looking through the Sprites, I couldn’t find anything that resembled fire.<br>
And then, after looking through half of my client.java, I decided to just search ‘Flame’</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean flameson = true;</code></pre>
<p>To…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">public boolean flameson = false;</code></pre>

              <p>Its really tricky, everyone has had a problem with it once. It should be in your sprites somewhere.</p>
<p>If not, you got to hunt it down in your client.java.</p>
