    <title>Whose Job Is It?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/whose-job-is-it/452621</link>
    <description>I am sure there is a joke thread but I am not sure where it is/if it is locked or what.

I posted this on another site I&#39;m sure you have seen it on there but here we go.


This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody. There was an important job to be done and Everybody was asked to do it. Everybody was sure Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that, because it was Everybody&#39;s job. Everybody thought Anybody would do it but Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn&#39;t do i. It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done.

Stupid I know...something random I saw in a magazine I get off and on.</description>
