<p>I don’t intend to be in any “group” on this site. As far as i’m concerned you’re all little 16 year olds who think you’re funny when in reality you all just sound like the biggest freaks. I’m here because I like to view the unique content that certain people have created. When idiots, such as yourself, post stupid things on threads related to topics like this, I have to respond because you don’t have a clue what the hell you’re talking about.</p>
<p>I can program, am I as good as whoever “jason” is, probably not. But you know what, I am 100% more creative that you fools will ever be, sorry.</p>
<p>As important as each are Creativity &gt; Performance every day of the week, baby. Therefore don’t say controversial stupid shit on threads like this because this is my area of expertise, not yours. You don’t see me saying controversial shit on the programming threads, so keep your ass over to that section.<br>

<p>What you are seeing right there was a semi-successful server pulling 20+ that was ended due to me having university. You are a stupid fool. The server is undoubtedly more unique than any shit you, or anybody else has made who is trying to debate with me ever made. You mind showing me the shit you may have created so I can slaughter the advertisement thread? Ofcourse not, because me and you both know your 718+ leeched generic junk never pulled 2 players.</p>
<p>I know you’re just saying it’s not creative because you’re probably bumbuddies with everyone, but everyone knows the server was unique and creative, hence why it pulled the playerbase it did. So how about you take that L and learn how to run a successful server k?</p>
