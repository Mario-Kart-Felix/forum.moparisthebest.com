    <title>Is anyone still using Delta sources these days?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/is-anyone-still-using-delta-sources-these-days/554133</link>
    <description>Hey guys,

I&#39;ve been out of this PS game for a long time now. My username on here back then was &quot;De Dust89&quot; but I can&#39;t figure out the password or email lol.. =/.

Just wondering, I used to LOVE the delta 317 source. I couldn&#39;t count how many servers I made based off of clean delta sources. They were so easy to make and literally EVERYONE used to use them. Back then it was less about programming experience and more about creativity in the actual game you were making because there was always a million people there to help on the programming side of things - practically everyone used the same server source, so, it was easy to help.

I&#39;m just wondering now, does anyone still run that delta 317 source? I was just browsing around the forum taking in all the nostalgia and I noticed a lot of PI server sources but no delta? It did have a lot of flaws, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if everyone found a new path. One major flaw was its efficiency. There was always a bunch of unneeded code that would make the games lag terribly.

Anyways let me know if anyone is still playing with that source! I&#39;d love to hear about it.</description>

<p>I don’t intend to be in any “group” on this site. As far as i’m concerned you’re all little 16 year olds who think you’re funny when in reality you all just sound like the biggest freaks. I’m here because I like to view the unique content that certain people have created. When idiots, such as yourself, post stupid things on threads related to topics like this, I have to respond because you don’t have a clue what the hell you’re talking about.</p>
<p>I can program, am I as good as whoever “jason” is, probably not. But you know what, I am 100% more creative that you fools will ever be, sorry.</p>
<p>As important as each are Creativity &gt; Performance every day of the week, baby. Therefore don’t say controversial stupid shit on threads like this because this is my area of expertise, not yours. You don’t see me saying controversial shit on the programming threads, so keep your ass over to that section.</p>

<p>What you are seeing right there was a semi-successful server pulling 20+ that was ended due to me having university. You are a stupid fool. The server is undoubtedly more unique than any shit you, or anybody else has made who is trying to debate with me ever made. You mind showing me the shit you may have created so I can slaughter the advertisement thread? Ofcourse not, because me and you both know your 718+ leeched generic junk never pulled 2 players.</p>
<p>I know you’re just saying it’s not creative because you’re probably bumbuddies with everyone, but everyone knows the server was unique and creative, hence why it pulled the playerbase it did. So how about you take that L and learn how to run a successful server k?</p>

My server literally takes a dump on that trash sorry buddy.[/quote]<br>
are you seriously suggesting your turd base 437 is more creative than MGTScape, an internationally renowned 718 server competing even with jagex themselves? you need to take a good look at yourself before u criticise others, i played your “20+” server and what can i say it was complete wank, dragons outside every door in varrock and shit ladders that don’t even work.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people played the shit I ran and I can confirm that Jason is probably ten times the programmer you’ll ever be with that attitude.

People like you will never stay quiet and that’s why people like you will never be liked or desired in a group.</p>
