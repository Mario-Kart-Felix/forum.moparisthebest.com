Hello everyone. Here is my latest project I&#39;ve been working on. You are welcome to come and take a look weather it be for a developers perspective, trying to dupe or bug abuse, or simply just to play the server.

[B]Intro[/B]
This server is basically trying to be the closest thing to a 459 server. Besides godswords and godwars, I don&#39;t believe there is anything outside the 459 revision in this game. It is not a remake. But designed to be fun with two paths for every player to choose, if you want to PK and enjoy yourself then type ::pure
You will be given some basic starter stats (not 99&#39;s) and some equipment to use. You will then be given a boosted EXP rate but will not appear on the highscores.

The other option is to work you way up slowly. You will gain a spot on the highscores to show your hard work. All skills work and the game has constant improvements.

Shops for supplies, only basic supplies and some quest items are included.
High level items come from bosses

Godwars, although not in the 459 revision it was highly requested.

Unique training areas like bandits. We don&#39;t train at rock crabs here.

Want a challange? go kill mithril dragons for some rewarding loot.

Remember killing the kalphite queen? ours is 100% like the old runescape kalphite queen, with
fully animated attacks and 3 attack styles.

Pest control. fully working.

Obviously this is just a small show of all the features the server has to offer. The only real way you can see them all is by playing
