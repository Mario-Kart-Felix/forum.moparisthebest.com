              <p>[center]<span class="bbcode-u">Port Forwarding Step by Step</span>[/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 1:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Goto your internet browser and type in your Default Gateway.</span></p>
<p><code>To get your Default Gateway. Follow these steps: 
Step 1: Goto Start &gt; Run 
Step 2: Type in: cmd 
Step 3: Type in: ipconfig
Step 4: Write your Default Gateway down</code></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">You should get a screen asking for you Username and Password. These should be what you used in creating your routers network. <span class="bbcode-b">NOTE: Default is Username: Admin Password: admin</span></span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Assuming you are now logged into your routers account. Look at the picture below</span></p>
<p><img src="http://i11.tinypic.com/54a0cas.jpg" alt width="140" height="120"><br>
Note: The picture is if you have a Linksys Router but don’t worry if you don’t.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Well you see where it says applications and games? Well your going to want to click there.<br>
What’s this? You don’t have a Applications and game place? Well search for something like ports or forwardin, Something along those lines. If you still can’t find it… just ask me in pm or something. I will see what I can do!</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Now your going to see a screen like this:</span></p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="http://i14.tinypic.com/5zeg8at.jpg" title="5zeg8at.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="http://i14.tinypic.com/5zeg8at.jpg" alt width="690" height="431"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">5zeg8at.jpg</span><span class="informations">1280×800</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-i">Ok now, here is the easy part! The place where it says Application (Something close if your using a different router) You can leave that blank. But the rest you need to fill in. So you want to run a server on port 43594? Fill it in like the picture above. (Opening Port: 43594 Ending Port: 43594 Protocol: Both) Then fill in the blank box with your ip address if it isn’t already there. (You can get this information in Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; ipconfig) Then click Enable or Use or something along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Scroll down and click save settings. Now if there is not an error and it says saved successful! Then you are Done with the hard part of Port Forwarding. Read the next part to get the ip to work!</span><br>
NOTE: If you need more help with any of this, just pm me or get in touch with me some way!</p>
<p>[center]<span class="bbcode-u">How to get a No-Ip!</span>[/center]</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 1:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Goto <a href="http://www.no-ip.com" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Here (No-Ip.com)</a> and make a free account. </span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 2:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">After you made your account, and your logged in. You need to make a no-ip, Ip… For this alls you need to do is Goto HOSTS AND REDIRECTS (Left hand side of the webpage) Click Add Host.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 3:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Fill in all the info as needed and click Create Host</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 4:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">Now, if you have no errors. Goto the downloads sections of <a href="http://No-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">No-ip.com</a> and download the DUC for the system your running. (I.E. Windows, Mac, Linux)</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Step 5:</span> <span class="bbcode-i">After you download it, Run it and sign in with the account and password you used on <a href="http://no-ip.com" rel="nofollow noopener">no-ip.com</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b"></span> <span class="bbcode-i">Click The check mark next to your host, and the icon (smiley) should change to a different one. Read the box below and see if has any errors. If it doesn’t, then you should be all set and have people try your no-ip. </span></p>
