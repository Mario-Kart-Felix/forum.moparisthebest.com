    <description>[center][size=14pt][u][b]DiversityX 2007 Not A Remake[/b][/u][/size][/center]


[center][size=14pt][u][b]About DiversityX 2007:[/b][/u][/size][/center]

[center][u][b][size=12pt]Well ever since I became familiar with Runescape Private Servers I wanted to start a 2007.  I actually never really intended for it to happen either.  Did a lot of researching countless nights with no sleep and noticed there was WAY to many pk servers out.  That was after the fact that I released a PK server.  I then shut it down for many reasons that do not relate to this thread.  I am just trying to make a nice old school server that will keep you entertained every time you login.  I want to provide content most servers cannot implement.  Yes It will take time but it is definitely worth it.  DiversityX started as a Lost Legacy remake, I then decided I wanted to change it up and make a nice pking server without thinking it was a fail due to the fact.  I was competing with the PK servers that are out today.  Then I started to think about 2007 again and it HIT me hard.  That&#39;s when I dropped everything and began this 2007! I hope this will keep you satisfied I hope to give you the best content around but time will actually tell.  Enjoy! [/size][/b][/u][/center]

FortaCloud VPS

Update Log 

Note I try to get on to work on the server atleast 1st a day there is gonna be times where I sit here for 8 hours+ and have a fit on it :p
I just wish better developers would offer help instead of payments.  Or teach us more then what we know.  Really the only part I have problems is with skills, minigames, and if I was to rewrite the engine.  That&#39;s where stuff gets tricky for me and I don&#39;t know why but in reality I quit RSPS about 2 years and 10 months ago.  I came back in March ran my server till April or May then I wanted to start something different I then released Lost Legacy it was supposed to be a project but then I didn&#39;t want to continue it then I released Ventus I was told you will have fun with pk servers.  Well I thought about it a good 3-4 hours a day or more and I noticed THERE was many pk servers out.  So I got thinking and I was like no no no no 2007 with my kind of content and content I can buy from developers would be a fantastic idea.  That&#39;s when I started this and ever since it&#39;s been nothing but happiness instead of stress :D

<p>The system is much better then most regular systems.  I have a good programmer that added it awhile ago.  There is no bugs with it.  There is over 25-30 tasks you can get.  The slayer interface actually makes it much better to use you can buy experience for slayer points ect.  Very simple yet very useful.</p>

<p>Um… don’t take this the wrong way but that sounds like you just took Jason’s slayer system and added tasks to it…</p>
<p>Did you at least add the ability to make slayer helmet etc? Did you make it so you need a rock hammer to kill a gargoyle? etc…</p>

<p>Note I try to get on to work on the server atleast 1st a day there is gonna be times where I sit here for 8 hours+ and have a fit on it <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=5" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"><br>
I just wish better developers would offer help instead of payments.  Or teach us more then what we know.  Really the only part I have problems is with skills, minigames, and if I was to rewrite the engine.  That’s where stuff gets tricky for me and I don’t know why but in reality I quit RSPS about 2 years and 10 months ago.  I came back in March ran my server till April or May then I wanted to start something different I then released Lost Legacy it was supposed to be a project but then I didn’t want to continue it then I released Ventus I was told you will have fun with pk servers.  Well I thought about it a good 3-4 hours a day or more and I noticed THERE was many pk servers out.  So I got thinking and I was like no no no no 2007 with my kind of content and content I can buy from developers would be a fantastic idea.  That’s when I started this and ever since it’s been nothing but happiness instead of stress <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=5" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
