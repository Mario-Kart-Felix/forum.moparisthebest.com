    <title>[pi] magic very inaccurate?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/pi-magic-very-inaccurate/444141</link>
    <description>I have no idea what is causing this, also spells seem to hit very low on players and much higher on npc&#39;s.

using insidaX base, just incase that helps.

thanks</description>
