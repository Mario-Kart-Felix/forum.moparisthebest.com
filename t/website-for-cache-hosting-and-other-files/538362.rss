    <title>Website For Cache Hosting(And other files)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/website-for-cache-hosting-and-other-files/538362</link>
    <description>I know that a user of the forums done this back in 2010-I know this account is new-, but I haven&#39;t heard much about it since. Is it still around? Also, if not, would the community be interested in a new one? I got way too much spare time and have seriously considered developing this type of website. It&#39;d be a full blown file sharing website, but I&#39;d love to specific for the RSPS community to host their cache files or other files.</description>

              <p>When you start hosting the cache and client files, you need to watch out about Jagex coming at you with copyright problems.</p>
<p>I was actually working on a website that’d host everyone’s server sources.  You’d supply links to the cache/client from a different website.  I stopped this because I started learning Rails and have another website that I must complete.</p>
