    <title>It&#39;s War</title>

This was my first time using pen tool (around the arm) so let me know how I can work on that. 
I wanted to change my style a bit this time, before I had just been basically putting things in random places, which makes terrible tags. This time, I actually thought of where I wanted to put things.

I haven&#39;t made a tag in several months so this was getting me back into graphics.

              <p>I advise depth in this, as you can see it may look like it’s shooting to the left, but it’s shooting a bit forward. Add sharpening to the front sides, but not too much, or you can use dodge/burn tool, or other ways.</p>

              <p>text isn’t really noticeable, and yeah, the gun needs more emphasis i think. possibly clean up the area around his head too</p>
