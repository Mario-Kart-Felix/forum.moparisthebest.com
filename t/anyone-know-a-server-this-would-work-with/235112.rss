    <title>Anyone know a server this would work with?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/anyone-know-a-server-this-would-work-with/235112</link>
    <description>Ok I found this TUT on making a server panel but the thing is is I need a server that it will work on, it all works up until it says look for &quot;public void RuneCrafting&quot; I can&#39;t find that anywhere in any of my server sources so if anyone could help please do here is TUT



Please note the background isn&#39;t really that color, it&#39;s just where I was standing when I took the picture, it is semi-transparent. The color&#39;s of the text can be changed, do not worry, that is just the default.

First off, open client.java and scroll down until you see a huge lot of ints and booleans. Find a spot where you can add this, to declare that the serverpanel is there: (it really shouldn&#39;t matter where).
[code]public boolean serverpanel = true;
[/code]

Now, you can either scroll down, or search for &quot;check&quot; because the next one you should get is just slightly below where you just were.
If you have specials in your server, that should be one of the first things you will see. Find a &quot;public void check&quot; code, and paste this after the very last bracket.
[code]public void checkserverpanel()
{
   if(serverpanel)
   {
      serverpanel = false;
      sendMessage(&quot;You have turned the server panel off. Type ::serverpanel to get it back.&quot;);
   }
   else if(!serverpanel)
   {
      serverpanel = true;
      sendMessage(&quot;You have turned the server panel back on. Type ::serverpanel if you wish to turn it off.&quot;);
   }
}[/code]

This is checking if the server panel is off or on, and sends a message to the player saying that it is turned on/off.

Now search for this:
[code]public boolean process() {[/code]

Add this below it:
[code]writePlayers();[/code]

This allows the panel to actually be there, without it, the panel would not show up.

Next search for this:
[code]public void RuneCrafting
[/code]
Above it, add this:
Code:

[code]public void WritePlayers()
   {


      if(serverpanel)
      {
         setInterfaceWalkable(15892);
      }
      else if(!serverpanel)
      {
         setInterfaceWalkable(-1);
      }


      int players = PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount();

      if(nonWild())
      {
         sendQuest(&quot;Safe&quot;, 15900);
      }
      else if(!nonWild())
      {
         sendQuest(&quot;Un-safe&quot;, 15900);
      }

      sendQuest(&quot;ServerPanel:&quot;, 15894); //Title

      //Left hand side
      sendQuest(&quot;Owner: Your name here&quot;, 15895);
      sendQuest(&quot;Co-Owner: Your name here&quot;, 15897);
      sendQuest(&quot;Players Online: @gre@&quot;+players, 15898);
      sendQuest(&quot;Made by: Tico135&quot;, 15899);
      //sendQuest(&quot;Wild status:&quot;, 15900); // Used for Safe zones!
      sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15901);

      //Right hand side
      sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15896);
      sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15902);
      sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15903);
      sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15904);
      sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15905);
      sendQuest(&quot;&quot;, 15906);
   }[/code]

This code is what adds the text to the server panel. &quot;int players = PlayerHandler.getPlayerCount();&quot; is getting the player count so it can display it on the server panel if requested. As you notice, if you don&#39;t request it using (sendQuest(&quot;Players Online: @gre@&quot;+players, 15898)Wink then I suggest you remove it. The &quot;if(nonWild())&quot; is checking whether you are in the wildy or not, and the messages below are stating what the message will say if you are, or are not in the wildy. &quot;sendQuest(&quot;Server Panel:&quot;, 15894); //Title&quot; is pretty self explanatory Wink. The codes with the &quot;sendQuest(&quot;txthere&quot;, line#);&quot; are displaying the text on the line stated, in this case the line is on the server panel. The &quot;//Right/Left hand side means that you can add things on both the right and left side of the line, you can choose to add things there if you want, but I haven&#39;t. You can add things like hitpoints remaining, combat level, easy things like that, it&#39;s entirely up to you.

Now since you declared that the server panel can be turned on and off, you need to make the command so that actually works. Place this command after any other.
[code]else if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;serverpanel&quot;))
{
   checkserverpanel();
}
[/code]
Turns the server panel on or off.</description>
