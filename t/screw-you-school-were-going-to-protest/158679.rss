    <title>Screw you school, we&#39;re going to protest</title>

    <description>http://rs2gods.net/haha.html

Yes, we have too many hours on school, usually 9-10 sometimes 11.
So every school in my city, Groningen decided to protest, but it went a little bit far and became riots with the police.
But still, the police can&#39;t handle us anymore.
We make a small fire, cops and shit come and screw our fire :( Then we make another, etc.
By the way, that big house at some of the vids is the City hall.


Edit: Also the teachers on our school are going to protest because they also think there are too many hours, they want more money or they leave.</description>

I used to attend a public school which had 6 hours a day. The day seemed too long and I had 1 hour lessons and 1 20 minutes break, and 1 40 minute break.<br>
I now go to a private school which is 8 hours and 20 minutes.<br>
We have 9 lessons in one day, each 40 minutes long and 3 40 minute breaks.<br>
I don’t understand but the 8 hour school seems so much less then the 6 hours a day.</p>
<p>my 2 cents.</p>

With the “we’re” I’m talking about upto 500-700 people probably, don’t know exactly, but I’m sure it’s around that.<br>
The school who started it already had like 300 people, my school with it also alot, and around 4/5 other schools.<br>
Don’t know if they get other schools also, but those schools suck more then mine.<br>
Edit: Nope, I’m not just sitting there and watching it kekek, trying to put a vid on which I made with my mobile, however strange file format googling atm.</p>
