    <description>Networks

Lately, I have been building my home network. It now features:
-3 Servers (1x Print, 2x Data)
-A few hard disks
-Fibre line (Only like 28MB to the internet)

I am thinking of reselling internet to people in my area.
What would be the best way of doing this? Yes, I have checked with my ISP, I am allowed to resell.

Would it be easy to run a fibre line to a road (under ground) then have a switch port which feeds a Gigabit Ethernet cable into the customers houses? Or would it just be easier to set up a really powerful WiFi router on one of my servers which has a different access password per customer?</description>

              <p>Good idea.</p>
<p>You could likely sell both.  With wireless you could set up a router for a cheaper price, as it won’t be as strong of a signal.  You could also sell wired by separating the ground all the way to that person’s house (about a centimeter or two wide) and use a stronger cable that prevents water damage to the cable (same thing as regular ISP’s would use) as there is simply no way an Ethernet cable would last too long, however I could be wrong.  You could sell this service for more, as from the Ethernet cable they could set up their own router, etc.</p>

<p>btw runescapedude how are you going to limit their internet speeds then, afaik the speed you have gets shared between all the computers that are using it. if you had 5 customers, they’d be getting 5,6/mb speed and with 5 more customers the speed would cut down by half. ???</p>
