    <description>How do you guys deal with DDOS attacks, Website hackers, Game glitches, and legal troubles with jagex? I&#39;m totally new to java and interested in doing works with Minecraft and RsPs, so if you were to go through any of the three problems listed, how do you go about countering them?</description>

I’d say it takes about four. That can be accelerated given if you have knowledge of other similar languages.<br>

You’ve had both me and t4 tell you that the language is the same throughout the different games and you even proved my point by using an analogy showing that in a language two games can be written completely differently. It’s YOU who doesn’t seem to understand that learning a programming language takes more than two weeks and to master a language such as Java it takes years upon years.</p>

They will harass you with DMCA notices and if that fails to get your attention they’ll threaten to take you to court, usually first offering a gag order (meaning you’d have to remove all rs hacking related content from your machine, shutdown your hosting, and never visit sites like theses again/release anything). If you violate said gag, you’re liable to get sued.</p>
<p>EDIT: might I also mention they have the time/money to find you if they think you’re a problem. one easy way of finding you is tracking down previous membership/account information.</p>

<p>It would appear that Docent is an absolute retard and doesn’t understand that Java is Java.</p>
<p>If you learn the Java language you can write code for any application that uses it. Simple as that. Dealing with legal issues is a whole different ball game, you need to host in countries where certain laws don’t apply, add disclaimers, different legality policies and a whole load more. Dealing with hackers is simple: secure your code and log everything so you can fix it. Denial of Service is just simply to work with a host that provides protection from it.</p>

<p>If you learn the Java language you can write code for any application that uses it. Simple as that.
