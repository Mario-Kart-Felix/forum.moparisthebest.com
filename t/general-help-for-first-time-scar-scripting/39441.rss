    <title>General Help for First Time SCAR Scripting</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/general-help-for-first-time-scar-scripting/39441</link>
    <description>I had just recently realized the potential of the SCAR program. Many of you are rather incredible scripters and I would like to know how to do a few things.

1) How do I press &#39;enter&#39; in a script? In the game I am currently trying to build a script for, I have to hit the enter key first in order to chat. 

2) How do I press the &#39;shift&#39; key in a script while also holding the up arrow. So it would be a &#39;shift-up arrow&#39; combo.

If any of you could help me out, that would be great. 

Thank You.</description>
