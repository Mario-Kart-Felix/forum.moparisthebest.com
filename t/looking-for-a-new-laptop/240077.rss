This one looks pretty good, i&#39;m considering it.

Details
A &#39;portable&#39; computer shouldn&#39;t make you lean to the side as you carry it. But you shouldn&#39;t have to sacrifice computing power for portability, either. The solution? IBM&#39;s ThinkPad 600 series, which offers fast processing, large color displays and top-notch multimedia features in a notebook weighing only five pounds. This ThinkPad 600 contains a [b]screaming fast mobile Pentium II processor[/b]. There&#39;s not a notebook application, business or multimedia, that this CPU can&#39;t handle with fluid ease. You might end up with a notebook that outperforms your office desktop system! Large amount of integrated L2 cache will keep the Pentium II running at peak performance. Your notebook&#39;s life expectancy might be lowered if it doesn&#39;t have sufficient room for memory expansion. The notebook&#39;s hard drive is large enough that you won&#39;t run short of storage space for a long time to come. Its active matrix color display that graces this ThinkPad is suitable not only for doing your own work, but for making multimedia presentations to others as well. Get more power with less bulk. Find out the meaning of &#39;mobile computing&#39; with the IBM ThinkPad 600.

I have 2 laptops and 3 desktops, needs moar jiggawatts so I can calculate pi faster.

Okay I was joking about that I only have one desktop and one server.</description>
