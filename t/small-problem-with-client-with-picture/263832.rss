    <title>Small Problem with Client - With Picture</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/small-problem-with-client-with-picture/263832</link>
    <description>I downloaded a source, and a client but when i start the client it always has the source name at the top.

How do i change it so it says the name of my server and not the client..?

<p>Thats what i have for mine</p>
<p>Change ic3barrag3scape to your server’s name see if it works.[br][br][size=1]Posted on: February 22, 2009, 12:43:47 pm[/size][hr]I know you didnt surf, it would have renamed the title of the window you were talking about</p>
<p>Thats what it does for me…</p>
<p>It would have done the job, because the title is what is going to be the title of the window it opens, not the run.bat</p>

<p>F1rey, you misunderstand my problem, i don’t want to rename run.bat.</p>
<p><span class="bbcode-b">Problem Solved</span></p>
<p>Thanks, Dark. I manually looked through GUI and found what i was looking for.</p>

              <p>Right click on your run.bat and hit edit</p>
<p>There should be a line that starts with</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">TITLE My Client</code></pre>
<p>My client is an example there will be the name of the client right now instead of that</p>
<p>So just change that to what you want it to say.</p>
<p>Hope it helps</p>

              <p>try your client class and maybe the EGUI class.  Search for the current title and replace it</p>
