    <title>TrisidiaX&#39;s 508 - Help Needed!</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/trisidiaxs-508-help-needed/472198</link>
    <description>Alright guys, so Im having these problems in the pictures as they will be posted below, here are the things ive done:

Okay so I started off by changing the no-ip to the one I created and the 127.0.0.1 to my hamachi ip (Ik Hamachi is horrible but oh well)

Then I went off to changing the Gui.java ip &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; to my hamachi as well.

I changed the compile and EconomyReset.java in the source to my jdk 1.6.0_17.

Then went off to the client folder where I did the same thing from the 2. Compile/ 2. Run/ x86 (My computer is a 32bit)

I looked for the classloader.java file along with the rest in that first black screen and couldnt find anything.

Im guessing the source compiler/run are working perfect. (The 2 boxes on the bottom with cyan colored letters)

and the 2 top client compile/run are giving me those errors. any clue what ive missed in between or what I should do ?

Here is the picture:

Are you trying to connect to your own ip? O_O make sure you use 127.0.0.1 for yourself and the hamachi/no-ip for players</p>

In the client. Have you changed it in the client.<br>
NOT client.java for the server.<br>
In the god damn client.[/quote]</p>
<p>nope, only thing I changed was no-ip in client.java and directed the .java files to my jdk, thats just about it, nothing else</p>

<p>Whats wrong with PvPscapez ? Then what do you suggest me using that has the same items as Trisidia and looks as well developed as Trisidia, and I know that I have but I still cant get it online neither can I log in … I have Verizon Fios Gateway, so what do you suggest ?</p>

Only if you don’t know how to jar a server correctly. I can jar any server on any version of java (assuming that the signlink isn’t a higher version then the java itself…) and it works…</p>

That’s an error because you’re cache isn’t being unpacked correctly.</p>

<p>ErasedPkz is one of the worst servers, structurally based. It has content, and works. But the innards are nasty.<br>
Plus, I wouldn’t give him the advice to get a new server if one doesn’t work. Really… How does that teach him something?<br>
“My wife’s a bitch, I’ma toss her in the recycle bin and get a new one” is what you just said.</p>

<p>Any java V7 or above should be fine. I like using at least 1/2 versions below the standard, so everyone can connect regardless.</p>

<p>Honestly, I had to restart my computer 3 times because of ErasedPkz, cmd was going crazy! So I got PvPscapez to work, and I’m at the log in screen and when I try to log in it says “Error connecting to server”, Any suggestions ?</p>
