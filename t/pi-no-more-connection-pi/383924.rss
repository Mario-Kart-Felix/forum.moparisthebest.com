    <description>This is very weird. I am currently hosting my server on my computer. I come home from work and discover that no one is online. I call one of my friends and he says it cannot connect. I reset my computer, modem, router, no-ip, and numerous things many times but it did not work. It was working fine days before. I have never dealed with anything like this before. Help??????</description>
