    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/client-cache-messed-up/240731</link>
    <description>Okay so I decided to try adding the God Wars objects from the site but I took them out and the ints but when i compiled and everything some of the God Wars objects were like still stuck in the game.  Oh and also as you can see most of the fences show up as penace fighter hats and some like red balls.  Wtf happened?  How can i fix this?  oh and I&#39;m using delta client.
