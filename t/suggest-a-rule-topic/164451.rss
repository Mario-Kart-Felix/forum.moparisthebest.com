I’m still not getting how you can let this happen, “Why is moparscape so much of a failure?” “Take a look at the mods.”<br>
Use your common sense to sort out those server developments that have nothing to do with the development of a server.<br>
Honestly in these topics there is NO information about the server, just the forums/site.</p>

<span class="mention">@Taharok</span>, less strict than the already inactive moparscape moderating team?</p>

<p>In all honesty, you are completely right in saying that we are parents of the forums, but we should not have to baby every single person on this forum. No, people should have their own choice for their topics. Why should we have strict rules which just cause people to break more rules? If we were less strict then there would be less rule breakers and more development.</p>

<p>Well whether the fact they have lasted just a month and a half is irrelevant to whether to try to pull people to their forums. I have seen a few that did not base their topic around their forums when we told people they were allowed to have development teams, but now that is basically all that they are doing. These people realize that they can take our rules literally and, instead of posting the link for their forums, they just give every last detail about it to have the same effect. But, in my opinion and in all honesty, who the hell cares about what they have in their topic. We are moderators, not parents.</p>
