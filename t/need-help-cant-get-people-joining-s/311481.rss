    <description>Hi there, as i really want this private server to work for me, im going to get thru detailed what i have done and maybe you could see what the problem is.

First of, ive downloaded Java 6 update 16, i made path&#39;s and classpath&#39;s.
[URL=http://img62.imageshack.us/i/systemclass.png/][IMG]http://img62.imageshack.us/img62/2540/systemclass.th.png[/img][/URL]
Then i went to www.no-ip.com and made my account, i added a ip i wanted and downloaded the DUC
[URL=http://img255.imageshack.us/i/noip.png/][IMG]http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/6271/noip.th.png[/img][/URL]
I downloaded an BASE (Source) named &#39;&#39;BlankScape&#39;&#39; from this forum (It sounds easy so i took that one)

i extracted it and then took up the source file, i edited the compiler til&#39; jdk16 and it worked fine.

i pressed on the run.bat and it said the server is online.


Then i went to the client folder and typed in gui.java and edited the ip to exiledscape.no-ip.biz and ran it.
[URL=http://img264.imageshack.us/i/guie.png/][IMG]http://img264.imageshack.us/img264/1606/guie.th.png[/img][/URL]

I made coming into the server but when my friends are trying they cant come in. I dont know what the problem is.

oh and by the way. i&#39;ve already opened my ports in portforwarding so that shouldnt be a problem.

Please tell me if im missing something, like changing the ip in the folders and so on. i really want to do this:) tyvm!&lt;3</description>

              <p>Well i didnt find the thing shamu said, but i tried to search for 127.0.0.1 in the client.java folder and i found it, i replaced it with my ip (exiledscape.no-ip.biz) and he tried 2 join… still didnt work<br>
could it be because of the source?<br>
