    <title>Looking For Good Coders</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/looking-for-good-coders/76458</link>
    <description>I have finally been able to get a server up etc. I am planning some MAJOR changes to it and I will need your help. I use Perfectscape as a base, which is also Phonescape I believe. I cant code for my life, just begining, I know how to add TUT&#39;s and such, as I&#39;ve added a few.

Back to the point, here is where I will need all the help I can get...

I Need To Know How To:

-Delete Shops
-Make it a normal server
-No lvls in Wildy, all wildy is PvP
-Fight Pits
-Full Fight Cave
-Move NPC&#39;s and make some drops rare
-How to delete some commands.

(Note) There is possibly more, but I am forgetting it now that I&#39;ve decided to post, I will keep adding everything I forget. Maybe if you guys could give me some tips on how to do such things, it would be a great help, in the meantime I will be looking through the TUT&#39;s again, looking for these things!

Any codes of the ones above will be rewarded with RS Gp and Adminship on my server when I release it!</description>
