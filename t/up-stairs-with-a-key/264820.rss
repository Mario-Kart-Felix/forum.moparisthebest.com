    <title>Up stairs with a key</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/up-stairs-with-a-key/264820</link>
    <description>Hello Moparscapers, ok I have encountered a small problem while trying to add stairs you can climb only if you have a blue key. Ive done it before with a yellow key but it wasn&#39;t with a staircase, it was just with an object I could cross but stay on the same floor. Please help ASAP.
Thank You In Advance.
