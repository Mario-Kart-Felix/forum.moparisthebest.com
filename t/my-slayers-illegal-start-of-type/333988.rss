    <title>My Slayer&#39;s &quot;illegal start of type&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/my-slayers-illegal-start-of-type/333988</link>
    <description>Well, I have been programming in java for a good year now, and right now, I am replacing all of Deltascape&#39;s Slayer. Right now, there are over 30 different NPCs that can become tasks, plus you can attack over 80 NPCs (thats because of the Combat Level Changes) using strings. All of the required levels are correct, plus experience rate is RS Experience Rate * 10. That isn&#39;t the problem. The problem is when you end up killing all of the monsters for a task, you should recieve Slayer Experience equal to the task monsters ID times 20. These are the errors I am getting:

[code]/tmp/jc_23451/client.java:149: illegal start of type
		if(taskID &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; taskAmount == 0){
		^
/tmp/jc_23451/client.java:149:  expected
		if(taskID &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; taskAmount == 0){
		         ^
/tmp/jc_23451/client.java:149: &#39;;&#39; expected
		if(taskID &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; taskAmount == 0){
		           ^
/tmp/jc_23451/client.java:149: illegal start of type
		if(taskID &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; taskAmount == 0){
		              ^
/tmp/jc_23451/client.java:149: &#39;;&#39; expected
		if(taskID &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; taskAmount == 0){
		                           ^
5 errors
[/code]

This is the simple snipit I made:

[code]	/* If player has a task, but killed all of the NPCs, the player gains exp. */
		if(taskID &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; taskAmount == 0){
			addSkillXP(taskID * 20, 18);
			taskID = -1;
			taskAmount = -1;
			sM(&quot;You completed your assignment, so you recieve Slayer Experience.&quot;);
			sM(&quot;You can talk with a Slayer Master or use an Enchanted Gem to gain another Task.&quot;);
		}
[/code]

That is posted right after the integers and booleans in client.java. When I try to make this into a boolean or void, I end up with over 100 errors (I use conventions and everything). Any help?</description>
