<p>What do you get when you cross aftermath with pastmath?<br>
Present math, or world domination. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Think about what that mean in a deep sense.<br>
This is not ment to be a joke but a deep thought, think.<br>
[/quote] That sounds confusing, weird, and hard to follow, but yet I understand it completely. There both from the past, and when you add them together, and both are half of  our prest day, you get the present, or if ones higher than the other (the other being half of our present time) it would make the future. So if it goes the first way, it would be the present, and if it goes the second way, it would be the future, which could lead to world domination, if you take 1 of the maths away, or subtract something from one of the maths. Like he said, think deeply.<br>
It actually gets to the point where its very interesting if you think hard about it, instead of joking about it.</p>
