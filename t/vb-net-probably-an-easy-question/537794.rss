    <title>VB.NET Probably an easy question</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/vb-net-probably-an-easy-question/537794</link>
    <description>I don&#39;t really know how I could name what I&#39;m looking for so I obviously can&#39;t look it up this way either.

This is a very basic first design for a game I&#39;m working on.

My problem lays in where you see the screen/colorblind preferences.

They get toggled by clicking the preferences icon in the right down corner.
But I also want to make other things, like e.g. friend list appear at the same position.

How would I go about doing this in a correct way? making the controls invisible and back visible is my only thought at the moment, 
but I doubt it is a good way.

Thanks in advance.



[b]Update:[/b]
I used a panel and add labels(controls) to it now at runtime.
I believe this is a a much better way than making my controls visible/invisible.
If somebody has a better way, still let me know!
