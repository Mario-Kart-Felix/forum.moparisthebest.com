    <title>Real PvP Looking For Coder</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/real-pvp-looking-for-coder/369555</link>
    <description>Type of Server [[Intro]] - Hey I&#39;m currently looking for a Coder who specializes in 317&#39;s+, and you must have experience if not do not bother posting. I&#39;m looking for a partner to Code &amp; Maintain this server with me it will be hosted on VPS and will be based on Pking.

Type - It will be created on a heavily modified Delta and I have already found the client and source and it does not need MUCH work needed but a day or so if we tried.

Why - I want to create this server because I seen a server back than who used this source and client it did not even change the name it was called SilentxPvP it had 100+ People but that server was hosted terribly and yet it was a sweet and sour success. 

I will not go into much Depth as I am currently going to check another forum for coders, but if your interested post below with experience, servers you&#39;ve worked for, and anything else that would catch my attention as to choosing you.</description>
