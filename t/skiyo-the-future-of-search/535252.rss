              <p>Well since I am still working on the development post (got a lot to add),  I will tell you the actual thing that makes us specials.</p>
<p>Our special search engine is an engine that will work as follows.</p>
<p>you search:  play umbrella   Result:  will play the song umbrella<br>
you search:  image husky    Result:  You will receive only photos of Husky without any BS or nonrelated stuff.<br>
you search:  remind me tomorrow at 5 pm to buy milk  Result:  tomorrow at 5PM you will be reminded at some sort of way (Message, App Alert, Email) that you need to buy milk</p>
<p>now this is the simple stuff,  later on I will get into the more complicated stuff.</p>
<p>Basically the search engine is going to be built by hand, without crawlers.  Now you probably are asking me and a crew of  4 people can write billions of terms and insert results for it…</p>
<p>The solution for this will be all the 2-4 Billion people that are using the internet, it will basically become a big group activity.</p>
<p>If you will search something and you will not be satisfied you will be able to make your own result or tell us that the result is not what you looked for.  Now while this happens we will get a lot of traffic of people saying they did not get results… we have a developed a special bot that figures that out and tries to pull a smarter and more common result,  this will happen in a loop until the percentage of happy searchers will be above a certain number.</p>
<p>You get the picture?</p>

              <p>Alot of this stuff has already been done by the search engines you claim are nothing like yours. For example, Google already has: general search, calendar, <a href="http://www.google.com/finance" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">stocks</a>, (g)mail, <a href="https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">jobs</a>, news, ebooks, (google) translator, even <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/events/realestatetools/" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">real estate</a>. The other things you mention really don’t pertain to a search engine so I don’t know why those would be features. As for the smart AI bot, I don’t have an opinion on that one since I don’t know much about it.</p>
<p>The point is: this stuff has already been done by Google, and this is just one company I’m using as an example. Got anything else?</p>
