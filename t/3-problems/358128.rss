    <title>3 Problems</title>

    <description>I will Rep+ if you help me with these, I may even pay if you help with [COLOR=&quot;Magenta&quot;]ALL 3[/COLOR], and do them correctly, and they aren&#39;t messed up.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERLOAD&#39;S
----------------------------------------------------
You drink the pot, receive the message, &quot;You are to weak to drink this again&quot;.
You log, and you are then allowed to drink the potion again.
How can I make the pot reset when you log, or make it to where the stats can&#39;t be edited
while they are over 115, then they would simply raise back to 120.

So, Drink the pot 120/99, log off, log back on, drink pot, 140/99, repeat process!
----------------------------------------------------

Summoning
----------------------------------------------------
Ok, you spawn an npc, and if you have one already spawned, it simply drops it instead.
But if you log, the familiar doesn&#39;t disappear, he comes back again, and you simply
can summon another one.
----------------------------------------------------

Npc
----------------------------------------------------
Npc 959, A&#39;abla or whatever, currently heals only hitpoints, and I was wanting
Her to do prayer &amp; special aswell.
I had special before, but you could keep stacking it up, so how would I make her only give 100, and if you have more then it doesn&#39;t work.
Like say, your 0 special, and she gives you 100 special (Full bar), and if you have full special, then it says &quot;you already have full special.&quot;
