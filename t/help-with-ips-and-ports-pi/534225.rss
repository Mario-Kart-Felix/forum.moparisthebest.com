    <description>EDIT: Wrong section, should be in client help.

 Hey guys. I have a source and client, and I&#39;m a little confused as I have never used a source+client like this. It has two worlds, I think they both run on the same port but I&#39;m not 100% sure.  What I&#39;m trying to do is have both worlds running on a different port or ip, whichever would be best for having 1 Eco server and 1 PVP(spawn) server with separate character files, commands, teleports, items, object spawns, npc spawns, shops etc... How would I go about this given the following bits of code?

As you can see both the  Ip&#39;s are currently set to localhost, and the port is set to 43594. This is code from client.java
[code]
        public static String defaultServerIP = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;        
        public static String defaultServerIPw2 = &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;;
        public static String serverip = &quot;&quot;+defaultServerIP+&quot;&quot;;
	public static int port = 43594;
[/code]

Further down I see the following code, this is where it confuses me, are both worlds using 43594, 43595 or are they both using different ports?

[code]public void WhatWorldIsWhatIp () {
		if(world == 1){
		serverip = &quot;&quot;+defaultServerIP+&quot;&quot;;
		port = 43595;
		} else {
                if(world == 2){
		serverip = &quot;&quot;+defaultServerIPw2+&quot;&quot;;
		port = 43595;
[/code]

If it helps it is deathlypvpz v4.1... [url=https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,633225.0.html]https://www.moparisthebest.com/smf/index.php/topic,633225.0.html[/url]

To avoid being flamed, I am not taking any credits, for the making of this server, except for what I have added, which is like 1% anyway, I have even added messages in the server which give credits to hack3r.</description>
