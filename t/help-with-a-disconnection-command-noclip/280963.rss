    <title>Help with a disconnection command [Noclip]</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-a-disconnection-command-noclip/280963</link>
    <description>I am working on a command, it is going to disconnect them and do a whole lot of stuff to them aswell as disconnect, but I am having trouble, it won&#39;t disconnect them but it teleports them and sends the message, demotes, all that other stuff.


[code]public void illegalcommand() {
	if(playerRights == 0) {
		C2X = 0;
		C2Y = 0;
		heightLevel = 1;
		blocked = true;
		disableppk = true;
		
	} else {
	if(playerRights &gt; 0) {
		demot3 = true;
		disconnected = true;
		PlayerHandler.msgAll = &quot;playerName+&quot; just lost their staff position!&quot;;
	}
}[/code]

Here is the command that I am trying to use

[code]if (cmd.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;noclip&quot;) {
illegalcommand();
}[/code]</description>
