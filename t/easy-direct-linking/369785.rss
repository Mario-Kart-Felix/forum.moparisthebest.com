    <title>Easy direct linking</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/easy-direct-linking/369785</link>
    <description>Im sure people know about this and im sure its been posted before. this is not a rep attemt either just putting it out there cause i thought it was alot easier thet uploading a cache to a direct link filehost or whatever.

the thing is called dropbox, all you have to do is drag your ziped cache into a folder, and copy a link, and you have a direct link.
go here to download dropbox

http://www.dropbox.com/

k so all you do is download it and make a desktop icon for easy accses(this also makes a system tray icon when downloaded). 
open dropbox click public and drag your cache into the public folder..
now to figure out your direct link just right click the cache you put in the public folder and hover over or click dropbox then click copy public link. 
that will copy the direct link to your cache. now just put the link in whatever file and done:)

note again this is not a rep attempt
do not flame because i will not feed your hunger for attention. 
i just put this up becaause i see alot of replys on web client tuts with people saying &quot;were can or how do i get a direct link&quot;</description>
