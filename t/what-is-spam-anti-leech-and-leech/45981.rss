              <p>Spam is “Stupid pointless annoying messages”, flaming is like spam, but insulting and/or more enraged. Anti leeching is … lemme find a good quote of it.[br][size=1]Posted on: January 09, 2007, 02:18:28 PM[/size][hr][quote=“Javacisnotrecognized, post:2, topic:41539”]First off it’s spelled ‘leeching’. And it is when someone new to the forums (Like yourself) doesn’t bother to learn how to do anything, so they just go to the tutorial section and add tutorials to their “server”. It wouldn’t be so bad, except that when they do it incorrectly they bother everyone with thier moronically simple errors. Making something anti-leech is intentionally adding a small imperfection (Such as a missing comma or semicolon) that anyone with half a brain could easily fix while they install the code, but that some leech can’t figure out for the life of them what the compiler is saying when “line 45239: ‘;’ expected       public void antileech(){ return }”. When someone explicitly puts the words anti-leech at the top of the tutorial, it is basically saying “If you don’t understand how to fix this small intentionally added error, then you are a retard who should fuck off and learn Java already.”[/quote]</p>
