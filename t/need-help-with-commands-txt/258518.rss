    <description>Is there a tut anywhere for how to add/remove and what ranking you have to be and such for this stuff? The client I have allows players to ::pickup, even if you are just a player. Is there a way to admin+ this and how?</description>

if (command.equalsIgnoreCase("command name") &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 3){</code><br>
change the 3 in the above code to the needed player rights for using the command.<br>
and if the client lets you have ::pickup, then go into client.java (in your client folder) and hit<br>
Ctrl + F and enter in “Pickup” keep going untill you see pickup with other commands like noclip. Delete the bottom bracket of the pickup command to the line under the next bracket, save, and compile.</p>
