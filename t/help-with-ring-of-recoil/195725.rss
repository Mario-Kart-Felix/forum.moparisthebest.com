    <title>Help with ring of recoil =(</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/help-with-ring-of-recoil/195725</link>
    <description>ok i recently added ring of recoil to my server. it works except for one thing. when the people attack the wearer it doesnt hit the wearer. it jsut recoils back at the person doing no damage to the wearer. the wearer can still attack though. so its a one sided fight. heres my code:

[code]if (AttackingOn2.playerEquipment[playerRing] == 2550) {
client p = (client) server.playerHandler.players[playerId];
p.hitDiff = hitDiff / 10;
p.pop += hitDiff;
                        p.hitUpdateRequired = true;
                        p.updateRequired = true;
                        p.appearanceUpdateRequired = true;
}[/code]

(pop is the int that makes the ring of recoil break. i couldnt make it break or it wouldnt recognize it as an int just a break XD)

heres another part of the code:
[code]public int pop = 0;[/code]

and the last part:
[code]if(pop == 50) 
{
sendMessage(&quot;Your Ring Of Recoil crumbles to dust&quot;);
deleteequiment(playerEquipment[playerRing], playerRing);
}[/code]

i have no idea whats wrong. i have tried almost EVERYTHING![br][br][size=1]Posted on: April 03, 2008, 05:03:49 PM[/size][hr]does ANYONE know wats wrong?</description>
