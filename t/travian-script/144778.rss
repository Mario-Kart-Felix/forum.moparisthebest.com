    <description>hello, 

since travian is an other game i can&#39;t put it in script request

now letst start
I&#39;ve tryed to make a scar script for travian or at least a script 
ive been working for this about 2 weeks but i cant get it fixed:S

I i got a script of a frend of mine but thats for linux and the problem is that i dont have that so i was wondering is some1 could make one for me so i can get it work

this is the game www.travian.nl / www.travian.com

if its possible it should do this the script

- make building resource fields when there are enof suply&#39;s and when the building is finished make a new one
- send attacks / raids to towns u can enter the coords of and keep attacking it till the resourcers are gone from that town also u need to enter previously how many troops u wanna send to each town
- it needs to have a option to set wich tribe u are
- rebuild troops when they die in an attack
- and it must be able to change towns and do all of this in the other town

if u want to make do this for me i would be greatfull 
i will suply the info about the game to u</description>
