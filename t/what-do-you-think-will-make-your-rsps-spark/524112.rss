    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/what-do-you-think-will-make-your-rsps-spark/524112</link>
    <description>What do you think will make your RSPS &#39;spark&#39;? If have a project or don&#39;t have a project (and have a great idea), post it here! How do you think that the server you are working on/the idea you have made will bring interested players in? What is that idea? Basically, I am here to start a unique discussion. Discuss your ideas.

tl;dr How will your RSPS attract players? Why? How will your idea attract players? Why?</description>

              <p>In my opinion three things can make a RSPS ‘sparkle’:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dev(s)/owner(s) having a rigid mindset.</li>
<li>The dev(s)/owner(s) having an abstract mindset.</li>
<li>A mix although generally speaking that means a larger team which tend not to work out within RSPS unless it’s clear who is in charge of what.</li>
</ol>
<p>Abstract mindset tends to be more innovative, rigid tends to be more logical and safe.</p>
<p>I’m not stating whether these ideas I’m going to use are good/bad, I’m just going to state what type they are just to help emphasise my point:</p>

<p>Rigid - Safe, logical idea - not particularly bad nor good</p>
<p>[quote=“Cres, post:5, topic:524112”]Had the idea a while ago, and I think asshole_rule had a similar idea since he sent it to me once (or was it someone else… not sure).<br>
Basically, the whole world is PK area. There’s a Saradomin team and a Zamorak team and there’s ‘nodes’ which you can conquer.<br>
These ‘nodes’ can be anything such as a city, mines, forests, boss areas, etc…<br>
The essence of these nodes is that you can only enter it if your religion has conquered it.<br>
The only way to obtain a node is to buy it, and the only way to do that is to outbid the war chest the current holder of that node has.<br>
For example; Saradominists have conquered the Barrows node and have a total of 5.000.000 gp war chest for that area.<br>
Zamorakians may outbid or buy that node for a value over 5.000.000<br>
Another thing is that you can never know exactly how much is in a war chest, so you never know how much you have to pay.<br>
If you pay less than the war chest, the money goes straight to the owner of the node.<br>
If you pay more, you gain the node but the excessive currency is not refunded.</p>
<p>Kind of a political system that would involve major clans and a major overhaul of the system… oh well :p[/quote]<br>
Abstract - Cba reading it fully (hence why I’m not making a comment on the idea itself) but I know it is</p>
<p>You don’t need any form of skill to make a RSPS ‘sparkle’ you just need some wisdom (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom</a> @ some of the people who think wisdom is a bad choice of wording)…</p>

<p>I think I did pm you something like that, my idea was a lot more combat based though. I’d love to make a server like that, but it’d take so long to make and would be really hard to get players for, because it takes a good amount of players for something like that.</p>

              <p>What do you think will make your RSPS ‘spark’? If have a project or don’t have a project (and have a great idea), post it here! How do you think that the server you are working on/the idea you have made will bring interested players in? What is that idea? Basically, I am here to start a unique discussion. Discuss your ideas.</p>
<p>tl;dr How will your RSPS attract players? Why? How will your idea attract players? Why?</p>
