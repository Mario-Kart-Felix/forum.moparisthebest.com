    <title>Cant get Eclipse working?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/cant-get-eclipse-working/544456</link>
    <description>Hello, i just started using eclipse to code, and i put my server files and client files into it.

My Client launches perfectly fine. But when i try to run my server, it gives me this error:
[code]Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: 
	IoAcceptor cannot be resolved to a type
	SocketAcceptor cannot be resolved to a type
	SocketAcceptorConfig cannot be resolved to a type
	SocketAcceptorConfig cannot be resolved to a type
	IoAcceptor cannot be resolved to a type
	PlayerHandler cannot be resolved to a type
	Player cannot be resolved to a type
	PlayerHandler cannot be resolved to a variable
	PlayerSave cannot be resolved

	Player cannot be resolved to a type

	PlayerSave cannot be resolved
	Client cannot be resolved to a type
	IoAcceptor cannot be resolved to a type

	at server.Server.main(Server.java:129)
[/code]

But it runs fine outside of eclipse? Any help?</description>
