    <title>After setting my paths, no compiles/runs will work</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/after-setting-my-paths-no-compiles-runs-will-work/529169</link>
    <description>I have tried every tutorial for setting paths, after the method I used to use on my old pc failed. And every single thing I tried, still comes up with the same result. &quot;Javac is not recognized program.&quot; or Java. Neither my &#39;run&#39; or my compiler will work. I have added my variables, I have updated java/removed old versions, nothing is working. I need help please. I am going to be starting school for programming next year, and I wanted to fiddle with a pserver as I self-teach to help myself get ahead. And I can&#39;t even get this source running. :(</description>
