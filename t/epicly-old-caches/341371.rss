    <description>guys if i played runescape in 2004, and still have the downloaded cache from then saved on an old hard drive, it could be made into a client right? because i have an epicly old hard drive in my mega old pc, which i no longer use, and i played runescape alot in 2004 on it then got my new comp, so would that cache be sort of rare? if so should i whip it off the comp and upload?</description>
