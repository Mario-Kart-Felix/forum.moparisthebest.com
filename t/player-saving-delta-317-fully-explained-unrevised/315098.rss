Well, i decided to add a prestige system to my server, like cod, but i needed to know the integer needed for &quot;prestige&quot; and the tut that WAS here, wasn&#39;t. So i experimented and figured out the numbers ( I hope ). 

So today, your going to learn how to add Player Saving ( things such as pkpoints ), and i&#39;ll give a c&amp;p Prestige command.

[b]Step 1:[/b]

To start off, you have to declare what your going to make.
In this case for Prestige, i&#39;m going to declare this in the Player.java file, because i&#39;m saving traits for the PLAYER.

So open up your Player.java, and anywhere below  &quot; public abstract class Player implements Constants { &quot; which is at the top, declare your int.

[code]public int pPrestige;[/code]

i&#39;ll explain the above;
public int, is how your declaring your method, you want it to be a number, and you want it to affect, the player. pPrestige, is what i&#39;m calling the method,  this is CAP SENSITIVE,so make sure you have a lower case p followed by a capital P.
pPrestige, in basic terms means p = Player and Prestige = the name of the method. p+Prestige= pPrestige.

You have declared your method in the Player.java, you may now save your server.
[b]
Step 2:[/b]

Now that you have that done, you need to tell the server to write what it&#39;s going to load, and load to the players file.

To do this, open up your client.java.

Now search (ctrl+f)  [code]} else if (token.equals(&quot; [/code]

You should see a whole bunch of else if&#39;s, scroll to the bottom,  and after where you see something like.
[code]					} else if (token.equals(&quot;character-w.ethisshouldbecalled&quot;)) {
						w.ethisiscalled = Integer.parseInt(token2);
					}[/code]

after the last &quot;}&quot; press your enter key, and paste this.
[code]					} else if (token.equals(&quot;character-pPrestige&quot;)) {
						pPrestige = Integer.parseInt(token2);
					}[/code]

This above code means in basic sense, that it will load to the character files &quot;character-pPrestige&quot;, and that pPrestige will be a number that will change(i.e, you gain points).

You now have the l doneoading.
[b]
Step 3:[/b]

Now you need to have it save the file.

search [code]			characterfile.newLine();[/code]

You should see something like: [code]			characterfile.write(&quot;[ACCOUNT]&quot;, 0, 9);
			characterfile.newLine();
			characterfile.write(&quot;character-username = &quot;, 0, 21);
[/code]


above that you should see
[code]		BufferedWriter characterfile = null;
		try {
			characterfile = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;./characters/&quot;
					+ playerName + &quot;.txt&quot;));[/code]

or something similar.

After the + playerName +&quot;.txt&quot;));
after the &quot;;&quot;, push your enter key to create a new line, then paste this
[code]			characterfile.newLine();
      			characterfile.write(&quot;character-pPrestige = &quot;, 0, 22);
      			characterfile.write(Integer.toString(pPrestige), 0, Integer.toString(pPrestige).length());
[/code]

What this very simplistically means is, it&#39;s going to write a new line in the character files called &quot;character-pPrestige&quot; and that it will save the settings you made from Step 2.

Save and close your client.java.


[b]Step 4:[/b]

Compile and run your server, make any random account, then log out. If you log out successfully, then it saves correctly.

Now i will explain Step 3 for if your making your own saving.

[code]      			characterfile.write(&quot;character-pPrestige = &quot;, 0, 22);[/code]
that line right there, is the source for all your problems if you get any errors making your own saving.
where you see &quot;22&quot; at the end of the line means how many characters your declared method is, although if you count it, you&#39;ll notice that theres not 22 letters in pPrestige so i wrote list for the letters, i think is correct:


Letter-Number

1 - 14
2 - 15
3 - 16
4 - 17
5 - 18
6 - 19
7 - 20
8 - 21
9 - 22
10 - 23
and so on.

So if you were making say, roundhouseK0Count for example(random i know),you would count the letter amount and add it to 13.
so 17 + 13 = 30.

You would change :[code]       			characterfile.write(&quot;character-pPrestige = &quot;, 0, 22);[/code]
To:[code]       			characterfile.write(&quot;character-roundhouseK0Count = &quot;, 0, 30);[/code]





[code]Tutorial outline, creating your own save:[/code]

Creating your own save is VERY simple, if you followed the tutorial, and you understand the integer part, you will get past this with ez.

Simply, repeat all the steps, just change the &quot;pPrestige&quot; to what ever yours is called.

[b]
The :: prestige Command![/b]

This is a very simplistic command, and the only reason i&#39;m adding this onto this tut, is because i believe things like these makes servers much more popular and addicting, this also had a resetprestige, if you faill below 0 prestige. I will ASSUME, everyone knows how to add commands.

[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt;= 999 &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 0) {
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Private, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt;= 1999 &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 1000){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Sergeant, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You need 2000 Prestige for your next Upgrade!&quot;);
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt;= 4999 &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 2000){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Lieutenant, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You need 5000 Prestige for your next Upgrade!&quot;);
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt;= 9999 &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 5000){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Captain, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You need 10,000 Prestige for your next Upgrade!&quot;);
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt;= 19999 &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 10000){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Major, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You need 20,000 Prestige for your next Upgrade!&quot;);
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt;= 49999 &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 20000){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Colonel, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You need 50,000 Prestige for your next Upgrade!&quot;);
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt;= 99999 &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 50000){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is General, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You need 100,000 Prestige for your next Upgrade!&quot;);
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt;= 999999 &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 100000){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Marshal, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You need 1,000,000 Prestige for your LAST Upgrade&quot;);
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &gt;= 1000000){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Honorary Marshal, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You have reached the max Prestige rank, Congratulations!&quot;);
}else 
if(command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;prestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; pPrestige &lt; 0){
plrText = &quot;My Prestige Rank is Idietoomuch, &quot;+ pPrestige +&quot; points.&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You seem to die too much. Try ::resetmyprestige. You&#39;ll need to pay 100m.&quot;);
}
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;resetmyprestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerHasItem(995, 100000000)) {
	pPrestige = 0;
	deleteItem(995, 100000000);
sM(&quot;You have reset your Prestige, good luck.&quot;);
}
if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;resetmyprestige&quot;) &amp;&amp; !playerHasItem(995, 100000000)) {
sM(&quot;You need to pay a fee of 100m to do this.&quot;);
}[/code]


[b]
Bonus:[/b]

This is a ::kdr command, basic concept from a 508, if you think you can create your own player saving properly, try and make this command work by using the same methods.

[code]if (command.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;kdr&quot;) &amp;&amp; playerRights &gt;= 0) {
plrText = &quot;MY Kill/Death/Rating is: &quot;+pkKills +&quot;--&quot;+ pkDeaths +&quot;--&quot;+ pkRating +&quot;&quot;;
plrTextUpdateRequired = true;
updateRequired = true;
sM(&quot;You have &quot;+ pkPoints +&quot; Pk Points&quot;);
	}[/code]





Bonus 2!:[100% DELTA ONLY]

To add it so when you kill a player you gain points, and so you lose points when you die...

Open up your client.java,
search this:
[code]
		if (deathStage == 2 &amp;&amp; System.currentTimeMillis() - deathTimer &gt;= 2500 &amp;&amp; [/code]
above that you should see a &quot;}&quot;

make a new line ABOVE THAT }.

Now add this

[code]
		killerz.pkRating += misc.random(54);
		killerz.pkKills += 1;
                pkDeaths += 1;
		killerz.pPrestige += 25 + misc.random(75);
		pPrestige -= 50 + misc.random(25);
[/code]

This means, the killer will recieve pkRating, pkDeaths, pkKills, and Prestige with set increase numbers, with the exception of prestige and rating, they give a random number. The pkDeaths, means it does not apply to the killer, because as you can see, there is no &quot;killerz.&quot; infront of it, as well as the prestige that doesn&#39;t have &quot;killerz&quot; infront.


If you have any problems, feel free to post and ask for help.
