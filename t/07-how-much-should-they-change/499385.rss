    <title>[07] How much should they change?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/07-how-much-should-they-change/499385</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been working on my character for a good bit now, mostly grinding quests and essence.  I was wondering how much do you think they should change?  I see consistent debates on the 07 section of the RS forums where some people post some decent suggestions (Graphic options, fixes etc).  While a lot agree, a lot of people don&#39;t want them to touch the game at all.  Should they change anything or should they not even touch it?</description>

<p>This = me.<br>
I’d rather that than RS-07 although their are some nice things i.e. old dance emote &lt;3.<br>
Their were many amazing updates since 07 that people are forgetting about and it’s annoying that people seem to have forgotten about them…</p>

<p>As for general/core game content, I really hope they don’t change too much; however, it would be nice to have a g<span class="bbcode-b">rand exchange</span>. Although this was when item prices started crashing a lot, I find it very inconvenient when trying to get most items, usually for quests. Maybe its just the fact that I can’t teleport.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>No, this is one thing that shouldn’t even be negotiable.  The reason it hurt the game is because it allowed merchanters to buy and sell mass amounts of items and clans to completely manipulate prices so they and only they can profit off it.  This wouldn’t be bad if the players didn’t rely on items being traded.  It’s almost like the stock market but with the food you need to eat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I started playing like 2 months before the Grand Exchange, and I only killed cows and other stuff around Lumbridge for that month. I honestly don’t believe in spending over 30 minutes trying to get one small ingredient for a quest, but if it is a requirement for me in the future, I will have to persevere and learn to overcome that unwanted thing.<br>

<p>You don’t know the pains of runescape classic. There was no run or Grand Exchange. And we had to take up inventory slots just for what we were wearing and a loveing sleeping bag as an anti-botting counter-measure.</p>
<p>I’m sure you can adjust. :)[/quote]<br>
I believe I can too, but I just don’t like spending a lot of time on any individual thing.</p>

Unfortunately, I started playing like 2 months before the Grand Exchange, and I only killed cows and other stuff around Lumbridge for that month.

Get all of the ingrediants yourself. The difference between 07scape and EOCScape - you can buy everything on EOCscape that you have to work for on 07scape.</p>

<p>You don’t know the pains of runescape classic. There was no run or Grand Exchange. And we had to take up inventory slots just for what we were wearing and a fucking sleeping bag as an anti-botting counter-measure.</p>
<p>I’m sure you can adjust. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>As for general/core game content, I really hope they don’t change too much; however, it would be nice to have a grand exchange. Although this was when item prices started crashing a lot, I find it very inconvenient when trying to get most items, usually for quests. Maybe its just the fact that I can’t teleport.</p>

              <p>I’ve been working on my character for a good bit now, mostly grinding quests and essence.  I was wondering how much do you think they should change?  I see consistent debates on the 07 section of the RS forums where some people post some decent suggestions (Graphic options, fixes etc).  While a lot agree, a lot of people don’t want them to touch the game at all.  Should they change anything or should they not even touch it?</p>
