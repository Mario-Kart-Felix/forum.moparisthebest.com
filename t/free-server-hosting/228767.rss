P.S
&lt;blockquote&gt;1) Follow the sticky on &#39;how to ask a question&#39; before you even bother posting in this section, any stupid undetailed questions will be locked without warning.
2) We will not help with computer problems, ie: portforwarding, how to set up java and such. Use google.
3) No development teams, however, showing off your recent development in runescape servers is accepted. We can make exceptions to the no development teams rule, pm a member of staff first.
4) No advertisement in any topics of this section.
5) Off-topic posts - It seems this section is basically used for a general discussion for you lot, i know this site is lacking boards but we are fighting to try get some changes.
6) Topic titles, use a brief descriptive title, a title such as &quot;NEEEEED HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP FAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; is just annoying and won&#39;t really help you get the help you need any faster.
7) Asking for a hoster is strictly forbidden.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
