    <title>RCS download CORRUPT?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/rcs-download-corrupt/518178</link>
    <description>when i download the runescape community script for the old website (ruby linked me the download) it downloads really differently. It says &quot;unkown time remains&quot;, but yet it still downloads. Now when i uncompress it, it says there is no data or so in this file (because unzipping doesn&#39;t work automatically when double clicking.) Then it says it is corrupted most likely. Would this be true? How can i fix it i want a old runescape website to download. :)</description>
