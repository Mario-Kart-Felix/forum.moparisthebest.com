Anyone ever have those?

After smoking some maryj for a while, I had one of these as a first cig and I have to say that was crazy. I didn&#39;t think cigs would make you feel that way. Extreme buzz. I&#39;ve only had three but I get the same feeling each time. What do they put in those fuckers man, it&#39;s almost like a high.</description>

I know there are people around here who wont even smoke with people that are smoking a cigarette at the same time, they seem to think it ruins the bud or something lol.</p>

<p>First off, nobody dislikes you for not doing drugs. The chastise your ignorant attitude towards those who do.<br>
Second of all, you will not get addicted to anything by just trying it once. That is physically impossible.<br>
Thirdly, “most people are ignorant about drugs”. This is true, but you fail to realise you fall into this category.<br>
Lastly, I have never said “it will never happen to me”. My words would be more along the lines of “it is unlikely to happen to me, because I am careful.”</p>

<p>ROFL!!! Thats the biggest load of shit I have heard in a while… I started smoking in year 3 (friends parents smokes) and kept going until grade 8…I haven’t since then and don’t anymore…wait should I be addicted and still smoking them? No… I haven’t had a craving or anything and I don’t need them I had like 4 at a party a few months ago and after that I stopped, I stopped after 4…didn’t need another one…or another one or another one. So what you said is crap, you have no life experiences of your own so stop trying to convert everyone.</p>

              <p>Since we’re on the topic of drugs, I smoked last night, because I was just feeling like one. I wasn’t craving it, I just felt like a smoke again. I don’t smoke cigs to much, but when I do, I smoke Camel Filters or w/e, because my dad buys them. I also hate smoking, because I turn into an extremely violent person. I get pretty violent when I’m normal, but when I get high, I’m out of control. I passed out soon after smoking, and had 3 holes punched in my wall, and one hell of a sore fist. But back to topic, I’ve always thought cigs had the same effect, I guess not. I’ll have to look into MarlBoro Menthol Smooths.</p>

Call me stupid, call me whatever, I don’t care what you call me because I’m not stupid enough to even start smoking. Once you smoke one, you’ll want another, then another. I really find it funny I’m disliked because I don’t do drugs. There is a select few who are able to do drugs, and still be sucessfull. Majority of people are ignorant about drugs, so they abuse them or do them. Those storys I told you about my aunt and uncle, happen to alot.

<p>And no you will not be addicted after one. Cigarettes actually TAKE getting used to, most likely your first one will not be a good one. After one you’re not like OMG THEY’RE SO GOOD.</p>
