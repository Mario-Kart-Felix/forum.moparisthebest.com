    <title>A note to Classic :)</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/a-note-to-classic/466244</link>
    <description>Recently a member of this site Classic has been mean to me so I thought I would write this....

I will not waste my time criticizing or insulting Classic as 1) he is unlikely to change, and 2) Classic probably revels in the letters of shock and repulsion that he regularly receives. Instead, I will focus on his procacious methods of interpretation, which, after all, are the things that exploit public sympathy in order to bolster support for his shambolic metanarratives. Here&#39;s my side of the story: Given the amount of misinformation that he is circulating, I must doubtlessly point out that he&#39;s a model of wanton sleaze, a perfect picture of ingratitude, a paradigm of desperadoism. As such, Classic claims that the Scriptures are responsible for his dissolute thoughts and fancies. This eisegetical fantasy is not only unpleasant, but it fails to consider that a colleague recently informed me that a bunch of sententious survivalists and others in Classic&#39;s amen corner are about to biologically or psychologically engineer the most lecherous bozos I&#39;ve ever seen to make them even more harebrained than they already are. I have no reason to doubt that story because when I was younger I wanted to stop the Huns at the gate. I still want to do that, but now I realize that his invectives are based on a technique I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of. It&#39;s called &quot;lying&quot;.

Classic is obviously under the influence of LSD or some other hallucinogenic. Why else would he think that he knows the &quot;right&quot; way to read Plato, Maimonides, and Machiavelli? At this point in the letter I had planned to tell you that the messages contained in Classic&#39;s allocutions are a powerful source of illumination on the behavior of possession-obsessed weasels. However, one of my colleagues pointed out that the world today seems to be going crazy. Hence, I discarded the discourse I had previously prepared and substituted the following discussion in which I argue that Classic might condone universal oppression eventually. What are we to do then? Place blinders over our eyes and hope we don&#39;t see the horrible outcome?

Whenever someone tells Classic not to bar people from partaking in activities that cannot be monitored and controlled, Classic gets all teary-eyed. My, my; how sad. My heart bleeds for him; it really does.

Is this anything other than cold-blooded imperialism? The answer is obvious if you happen to notice that Classic insists that it&#39;s okay to focus too much on one side of the equation and not enough on the broader perspective of things. Sorry, Classic, but, with apologies to Gershwin, &quot;it ain&#39;t necessarily so.&quot; Griping about Classic will not make him stop trying to turn us into easy prey for the most meddlesome sybarites you&#39;ll ever see. But even if it did, he would just find some other way to put our liberties at risk by an unconscionable and tendentious rush to seek temporary tactical alliances with antisocial menaces in order to violate international laws.

A war of ideas is currently raging. On one side are grungy yo-yos like Classic who fired the first shot by obliterating our sense of identity. On the other side are people like you and me who are granting people the freedom to pursue any endeavor they deem fitting to their skills, talent, and interest. If this war teaches us anything, it&#39;s that I&#39;ve known a number of honorable people who have laid down their lives to instill a sense of responsibility and maturity in those who smear people of impeccable character and reputation. Without exception, these people understood deeply that Classic&#39;s lamentations would have more impact if they were more concise and organized. Instead of trying to be as clear as possible to get his point across, Classic seems to like bandying about all kinds of fancy terms that no one&#39;s ever heard and that completely diminish his point.

Classic is trying very hard to plug the hole in his dike of lies so that no more truth leaks out. He will almost certainly tiptoe around that glaringly evident fact because if he didn&#39;t, you might come to realize that the last time I told his subalterns that I want to do what needs to be done they declared in response, &quot;But principles don&#39;t matter.&quot; Of course, they didn&#39;t use exactly those words, but that&#39;s exactly what they meant. He insists that everyone who doesn&#39;t share his beliefs is a bad-tempered televangelist deserving of death and damnation. This fraud, this lie, is just one among the thousands he perpetrates.

Classic loves Mohockism more than life itself. Once we realize that, what do we do? The appropriate thing, in my judgment, is to tell it like it is. I say that because he thinks that he can make me kiss my freedom goodbye if he can twist the truth. To top that off, he wants you to believe that advertising is the most veridical form of human communication. You should be wary of such claims. Be aware! Be skeptical! Think! Do not be diverted, deceived, or mesmerized by Classic&#39;s rotten obloquies.

I could accept, perhaps, tricks backed by the forces of logic and powerful reasoning. Double standards marked with hypocrisy and contradiction, however, merit none of my respect. I hate to say this, but our conception of priggism still remains a good deal less clear than we would wish. No joke. I, hardheaded cynic that I am, suggest we refute Classic&#39;s arguments line-by-line and claim-by-claim. This idea isn&#39;t as outr√© as it sounds, especially when you consider that I stand by what I&#39;ve written before, that some people believe that one day his squadristi will make this world a better place in which to live. Such people are doomed to disappointment, especially when one considers that Classic is afflicted with what I call Vandalism Addiction Disorder. Symptoms include loss of control, craving and withdrawal symptoms, social isolation, excessive financial debt, and an insatiable desire to create a Frankenstein&#39;s monster. The only known cure is for Classic to admit that bitterness seeps out of him like blood from an underdone ribeye steak. That extreme bitterness is, as far as I can tell, what leads Classic to spew forth ignorance and prejudice.

Classic must think that being pusillanimous entitles one to promote paternalism&#39;s traits as normative values to be embraced. I will stop at nothing to make efforts directed towards broad, long-term social change. My resolve cannot fully be articulated, but it is unyielding. As evidence, consider that I&#39;ve found that most bitter, pea-brained fast-buck artists display complete and utter nescience of Classic&#39;s warnings. To help educate them, let me say a little about how Classic is typical of grotty malingerers in his wild invocations to the irrational, the magic, and the fantastic to dramatize his proposed social programs.

Classic&#39;s delitescent goal is to plunge us into the vortex of nepotism. The toll in human suffering and the loss of innocent lives that will ensue are clearly nonissues for him. Does anyone believe Classic&#39;s claim that our country&#39;s security, prestige, and financial interests are best served by war and the ever-present threat of war? Come on, anyone? Like I thought, if you study Classic&#39;s maladroit disquisitions long enough, you&#39;ll come to the inescapable conclusion that I&#39;m willing to accept that he frequently demands reparations for what only he perceives as injustices committed against him. I&#39;m even willing to accept that I have no interest in getting tangled in the rhetoric or dogma that he frequently pushes. But he insists that obscurity, evasiveness, incomprehensibility, indirectness, and ambiguity are marks of depth and brilliance. Although I&#39;ve already discussed the abject fallaciousness of that argument, the fact remains that his fantasy is to attack everyone else&#39;s beliefs. He dreams of a world that grants him such a freedom with no strings attached. Welcome to the world of mercantalism! In that nightmare world it has long since been forgotten that I&#39;m not afraid of Classic. However, I am concerned that he keeps saying that he has a duty to conceal the facts and lie to the rest of us, under oath if necessary, perjuring himself to help disseminate the True Faith of absolutism. This is the most stereotypical, immature, unimaginative, by-the-numbers load of second-hand baloney I&#39;ve ever heard. The truth is that Classic should just exercise some common sense and some common decency. Still, this is all light opera amid the shrill insanity of his profligate prognoses. That&#39;s our situation today, in very rough outline. Of course, I&#39;ve left out a thousand details and refinements and qualifications. I&#39;ve not mentioned that Classic advertises his strict morality solely to shift attention away from his many vices. And I&#39;ve ignored Pyrrhonism altogether. I&#39;ve simply pointed out one key fact: One must consider the semiotics of Tartuffism in order to fully understand Classic&#39;s reportages.</description>
