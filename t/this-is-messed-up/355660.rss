    <description>hi, if you read my LAST post of how to put in custom npcs, then, w/e this is related to that

when i put the npc in, i see it as a violin! but my players see it as its supposed to be, its ironic, kind of...
because i made it, i cant see it, they have no updated client to see it, but yet they somehow do see it
anyways, how can i make it so i do see it?</description>
