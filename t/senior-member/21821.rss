    <description>hey guys,

not long ago I came to these forums as a little noob, knowing things but not knowing what to do with them. These forums have helped me grow in many ways. From the extensive time that I spent in the tutorials section, and everything that I&#39;ve ever helped anyone with, or got help from. About 3 weeks ago I became a regular member. I was so proud that I could no longer be seen as just another noob or leech on the site. I am now a Senior Member. I don&#39;t think you guys understand how much this happy this makes me. Without this site I would have never became as great as graphics as I have, I wouldn&#39;t have half the things on my pc, I just really want to thank everybody for helping me, or letting me help them. I&#39;ve written over 5 tutorials that people have given me great feedback on, and helped many people wherever I could. I just want to let everyone know that I have tons more to come, because I have no plans in leaving. I plan to become way better in web development, because this past week I created my very first web template that everyone thought was great, I want to get better in software coding, and cracking software itself. I also have many more tutorials to spew out.

Thanks for everything guys,

Buzzy</description>

<p>Same, if I do get 50 rep I am going to wait till at least 55 or 60 before PM’ing an Admin. Some of my rep points were totally pointless, but I guess it makes up for some people who don’t give you rep when you do help… :rolleyes:</p>
<p>Anyway, all this talk about rep is against the rules you guys, eh?</p>

<p>My last 3 rep points were titled “happy x-mas(early)” from 3 different people. It’s weird how they all had the same description. So yeah, I know what you mean <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I remember on kaitnieks, Zup repped me and i got like 20 points from it. All I did was impersonate Dr. Phil, lol. I’m kinda glad we don’t have the same rep system here(every 15 rep you have you can hand out 1 rep point).</p>

Yeah I always hand out rep when people help me(or sometimes others). It doesn’t mean a whole lot, but I know that in the end the person always appreciates it. Your about half way there, and you definitely deserve it so I bet it won’t be much longer anyways. On kaitnieks forums, you handed out a rep point for every 15 rep you had. because of that it was much easier to get CM, and it was just as easy to get over 100 rep. Just so you know your not missing out on anything(The CM section really doesn’t have a whole lot other then discussions that go way over my head), but of course the title does look good under the name.</p>

<p>S1ms - It really wasn’t hard for me to get 50 rep. People gave me rep for helping other people. Just be a friendly, helpful person, which I’m 100% sure you are.</p>

<p>I am actually helping, alot. <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I’m not complaining or whatever, i’m just saying people don’t know anymore what ‘being nice’ means. For example, j4m3s asked me for a tutorial how to burn movies- I made one for him. What did i get? a few posts saying thanks (now that was pretty nice) but j4m3s? “I can’t get it working…” and no thanks at all. This is just a dumb example, but you see, people forget to thanks sometimes.</p>
<p>And coatbridge, you’re such a sweet person! <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=6" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"> (She knows what i mean <img src="https://forum.moparisthebest.com/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=6" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"> )</p>
