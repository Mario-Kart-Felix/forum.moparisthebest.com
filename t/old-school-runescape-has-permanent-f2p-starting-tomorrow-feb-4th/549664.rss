<p>How is it tainted… people buy gold regardless?</p>
<p>Instead of people RWTing it and potentially getting scammed, banned or whatever else there is now an alternative. Nothing wrong with it, imo.</p>
<p>And on top of the “iffy” benefits of using bonds to purchase gold it allows people that can’t afford or cannot pay for membership with real money, they can buy it with their in-game gold.</p>
