    <title>Project: Open RSCD_v25</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/project-open-rscd-v25/256866</link>
    <description>Hello everyone!

Since the overall public development of the RSCD_v25 server is just about dead, I have come up with an idea that could benefit everyone here. For those familiar with the MANGOS world of warcraft private server - that is an opensource server that has been worked on and improved for the greater public good to the point where it is nearly perfect at emulating a WoW realm. Let us work together and improve the RSCD_v25 daemon and associated website so that everyone may benefit from the development.

It is not the &quot;proprietary code&quot; that keeps players playing your private servers over others. The reason your player base comes is the server avaliblity and overall quality of the service the administrators and moderators provide. Instead of complaining about leechers, leech proofing source code, and fighting, lets put our heads together and continue improving this code. Jagex has screwed us out of Runescape Classic and it is our job to provide this for ourselves and our friends.

I have created a sourceforge project for the Open RSCD_v25 development. I am interested in having everyone that would like to contribute, do so. The goal is to have it remain as close to the original version of Runescape as possible.

--------------------------------------------------------

http://sourceforge.net/projects/rscdv25/

SVN access has been set up and once more people are interested, I will start creating developer accounts for SVN access.

Right now I am stripping all identifiable code from the DARScape Classic source which contains all the security improvements, bug fixes, and code additions along with the updated and secured punBB forum. I will also be uploading an emptied database too. Once that is done, the source will be uploaded to sourceforge.

I ask anyone who has added code improvements to either the punBB forum, the RSCD punBB mod, or the RSCD_v25 server to request to join this project so that we may merge the code and continue to develop this awesome server.

--------------------------------------------------------

While using an unmodified source would be okay, the time saved by using an already updated and fixed source which has been proven to withstand 2+ weeks of uptime without crashing seems like a better idea. Another thing is that the security fixes to the punBB forum in which I have made are already implemented in the code I am running. Another issue is that there has been fixes and updates done by Uberpker and Nick (forgot his alias) that I do not remember how to add back in. Nick is MIA right now but Uberpker is still around.

Here are the change logs so far:

Nov-11-2008:
You can no longer use :: stuck when you are inside the Wilderness.
An :: online command has been added, this displays current users online.
A Mod/Admin shout command has been added, with this we will be able to show you important messages that shows all over the world wherever you are.

Nov-11-2008:
Added 3 Black Dragons and 1 King Black Dragon to the taverley dungeon!
These Dragons can drop Dragon Square Shield, Dragon Medium Helmet &amp; Dragon Axes if lucky!

Nov-11-2008:
2 worlds launched - One for global pking &amp; one Normal.
Client downloads available for each one.

Nov-11-2008:
Added Thieving!

Nov-11-2008:
Added God Spells!

Nov-11-2008:
Added working Fatigue and Sleeping.

Nov-11-2008:
Fixed the last remaining Dupe-bug.

Nov-11-2008:
Added listening server password to prevent world servers from hijacking.

Nov-11-2008:
Melee Exp Rate has been set to 2x.

Nov-11-2008:
Added Askimet Spam protection plugin to PunBB Forum to combat the spam bots.

Nov-13-2008:
Completed new world selection client. The new client download has added functionality of the choice when first opening between selecting the DARScape Classic world or the DARScape PK world. Delete the old client(s) that you may have already downloaded. The new unified client allows players in the PK world to attack anyone anywhere regardless of their combat level. There are no safe areas! Play at your own risk.

Nov-13-2008:
Set xp rate to near-RSC levels for mele combat. Other skills still have higher xp rates but due to their difficulty, it should be a bit more interesting to keep them at the higher rate.

Nov-13-2008:
Fixed exp rate to exact RSC/RS2 levels. Need to further test on high level NPCs to verify correct formula.

Jan-10-2009:
Fixed Askimet page slowdown with updated version. After posts were made, it was taking a long time to reload the topics.

Jan-11-2009:
Added a character stat editor in the Administration area.

Jan-11-2009:
Added ability for administrators to edit character profiles (Rscdaemon link) and ban/promote to pmod/force logout/change xy coordinates. (Change xy coords such as to jail location)

Jan-11-2009:
Added a human test in the registration page to help reduce the spam bots. Askimet has caught every single one and banned it, but I am getting tired of having to manually delete every banned bot registration. This should stop that entirely.



As you can see, there have been a lot of positive changes that everyone can benefit from by using this modified code.

--------------------------------------------------------

I am in the process of cleaning the directories and updating the files. A very useful README.txt file will be included. Keep checking back here for updates.

Included utilities: RSCD Sprite Editor, RSC_Customizer (xml editor), RSC Map Editor, Compression Tool</description>

              <p>Correct. I have stopped developing this. I have actually returned back to the files used to create this release and have continued developing. I honestly don’t know ravfe’s development potential but if you would like to try to fix a few bugs, I would publish the next edition. I’m not sure if the 1.3 version included the upgraded forum or not. (I upgraded from PunBB to FluxBB, a fork created by the original developers. It is still compatible with all skins and mods for 1.2.x but includes several bug fixes)</p>
<p>My live version: <a href="http://mendax.kicks-ass.org/forum/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://mendax.kicks-ass.org/forum/</a></p>
<p>Somethings are still broken - subscriber stuff, Ventrillo crontab, backup crontab, char stat editor that tx made, pmod promote/demote page in admincp, and a couple other things. While my live version is a bit more up to date and fixed, it does not differ a whole lot from what I released in Open RSCD_v25 v1.3.</p>
<p>I would <em>love</em> to see the kills/deaths feature working with the game server and database, same with bot trapping, player reports, and integration with IRC and the in-game chat.</p>
<p>Anyone up to the task of fixing some of these things and publishing them for the greater good?</p>

<p>if you release something that is under the GPL, you have to give out the source as well. in this case, i guess you are fine because you aren’t releasing it… but then, you might be legally, who knows? i’m not to sure where the bridge is when it comes to determining when you need to give the source code out or not. the lesser GPL does say you can use it for commercial purposes explicitly, though.</p>

<p>One last issue: Jagex Intellectual Property. I have made the decision not to include the source files nor the compiled files that include Jagex’s client. Sourceforge cannot ban this project because it is 100% black box reverse engineered code for a server emulation daemon which is legal in the UK and the EU. I believe this is also the case in the US. RSCA had a topic about a Jagex agent trying to send a takedown request and being informed that he could not do anything which resulted in never hearing from him again. From what I learned through a friend who was into the RSCD server Reines ran back with <a href="http://Warthog.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Warthog.net</a>? when he was charging $5/month to play, was that the only reason Jagex was able to take them down was because of the charging for membership to play and the use of their client. Was that the case?</p>

<p>All the actual material from RSC (images, names/text of crap, etc) are still protected by copyright. It is Jag(e)x property and they have the right to stop you from using it at any time. The reason Reines’ server got shut down was mainly because of the $5 subscription method that paid for his dedi (and some). All intellectual property of Jag(e)x can be used for personal, non-commercial use:</p>

<p>PS - Reines ran the server alone, although I believe Kossu was the other admin. <a href="http://Warthog.net" rel="nofollow noopener">Warthog.net</a> (<a href="http://Wartnet.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Wartnet.org</a>), was formerly <a href="http://Reinet.co.uk" rel="nofollow noopener">Reinet.co.uk</a>, until Reines decided to leave RSC for awhile and created his own forums (SYI.cc). RSCD came out as an April Fool’s joke at first, then just like a DM server, and basically what you see now.</p>

<p>I’ve always seen both forums as being flooded by very young and immature members making poor posts. That is the problem when the player base for a game is mostly 13-15 year old children. The way I deal with it is to either provide some sort of help if possible or simply ignore them.</p>
