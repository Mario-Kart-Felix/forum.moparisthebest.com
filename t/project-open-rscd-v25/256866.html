        <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Since the overall public development of the RSCD_v25 server is just about dead, I have come up with an idea that could benefit everyone here. For those familiar with the MANGOS world of warcraft private server - that is an opensource server that has been worked on and improved for the greater public good to the point where it is nearly perfect at emulating a WoW realm. Let us work together and improve the RSCD_v25 daemon and associated website so that everyone may benefit from the development.</p>
<p>It is not the “proprietary code” that keeps players playing your private servers over others. The reason your player base comes is the server avaliblity and overall quality of the service the administrators and moderators provide. Instead of complaining about leechers, leech proofing source code, and fighting, lets put our heads together and continue improving this code. Jagex has screwed us out of Runescape Classic and it is our job to provide this for ourselves and our friends.</p>
<p>I have created a sourceforge project for the Open RSCD_v25 development. I am interested in having everyone that would like to contribute, do so. The goal is to have it remain as close to the original version of Runescape as possible.</p>

<p>SVN access has been set up and once more people are interested, I will start creating developer accounts for SVN access.</p>
<p>Right now I am stripping all identifiable code from the DARScape Classic source which contains all the security improvements, bug fixes, and code additions along with the updated and secured punBB forum. I will also be uploading an emptied database too. Once that is done, the source will be uploaded to sourceforge.</p>
<p>I ask anyone who has added code improvements to either the punBB forum, the RSCD punBB mod, or the RSCD_v25 server to request to join this project so that we may merge the code and continue to develop this awesome server.</p>
<hr>
<p>While using an unmodified source would be okay, the time saved by using an already updated and fixed source which has been proven to withstand 2+ weeks of uptime without crashing seems like a better idea. Another thing is that the security fixes to the punBB forum in which I have made are already implemented in the code I am running. Another issue is that there has been fixes and updates done by Uberpker and Nick (forgot his alias) that I do not remember how to add back in. Nick is MIA right now but Uberpker is still around.</p>
<p>Here are the change logs so far:</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
You can no longer use :: stuck when you are inside the Wilderness.<br>
An :: online command has been added, this displays current users online.<br>
A Mod/Admin shout command has been added, with this we will be able to show you important messages that shows all over the world wherever you are.</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
Added 3 Black Dragons and 1 King Black Dragon to the taverley dungeon!<br>
These Dragons can drop Dragon Square Shield, Dragon Medium Helmet &amp; Dragon Axes if lucky!</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
2 worlds launched - One for global pking &amp; one Normal.<br>
Client downloads available for each one.</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
Added Thieving!</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
Added God Spells!</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
Added working Fatigue and Sleeping.</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
Fixed the last remaining Dupe-bug.</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
Added listening server password to prevent world servers from hijacking.</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
Melee Exp Rate has been set to 2x.</p>
<p>Nov-11-2008:<br>
Added Askimet Spam protection plugin to PunBB Forum to combat the spam bots.</p>
<p>Nov-13-2008:<br>
Completed new world selection client. The new client download has added functionality of the choice when first opening between selecting the DARScape Classic world or the DARScape PK world. Delete the old client(s) that you may have already downloaded. The new unified client allows players in the PK world to attack anyone anywhere regardless of their combat level. There are no safe areas! Play at your own risk.</p>
<p>Nov-13-2008:<br>
Set xp rate to near-RSC levels for mele combat. Other skills still have higher xp rates but due to their difficulty, it should be a bit more interesting to keep them at the higher rate.</p>
<p>Nov-13-2008:<br>
Fixed exp rate to exact RSC/RS2 levels. Need to further test on high level NPCs to verify correct formula.</p>
<p>Jan-10-2009:<br>
Fixed Askimet page slowdown with updated version. After posts were made, it was taking a long time to reload the topics.</p>
<p>Jan-11-2009:<br>
Added a character stat editor in the Administration area.</p>
<p>Jan-11-2009:<br>
Added ability for administrators to edit character profiles (Rscdaemon link) and ban/promote to pmod/force logout/change xy coordinates. (Change xy coords such as to jail location)</p>
<p>Jan-11-2009:<br>
Added a human test in the registration page to help reduce the spam bots. Askimet has caught every single one and banned it, but I am getting tired of having to manually delete every banned bot registration. This should stop that entirely.</p>
<p>As you can see, there have been a lot of positive changes that everyone can benefit from by using this modified code.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am in the process of cleaning the directories and updating the files. A very useful README.txt file will be included. Keep checking back here for updates.</p>
<p>Included utilities: RSCD Sprite Editor, RSC_Customizer (xml editor), RSC Map Editor, Compression Tool</p>

        <p>There’s a difference between why WoW server emulators actually get developed from being open source, compared to this tiny little forum. WoW is the biggest online game in the world, which also requires money to play therefore leaving many who can’t pay for it, to develop it privately. Runescape Classic is a game that does not exist anymore, and was a free 4mb game.</p>
<p>I doubt your going to get many (if any) people helping you with this, due to the fact that most people who could help you, are doing their own thing.</p>
<p>Also last time i played a MANGoS server, it was horrible, i played a few Antrix/Ascent/ArcEmu and they were okay, but almost every wow pserver i’ve played was not that stable, and had a ton of bugs/missing features, its not really valid to say its perfect at emulating a WoW realm.</p>
<p>GL with this.</p>

        <p>If you’re looking for an actual RSC emulation project with clear goals defined before the project begins, then I may be interested. Judging by your changelog, I don’t see anyone there that has a strong Java background. If there are more people interested in development, then this may be a beneficial project.</p>
<p>If not, then this is just going to turn into another<br>
Community member: “hey I want this to be added”<br>
Coder: “ok there you go!”<br>
project, which never ends well.</p>
<p>Basically all I’m saying is that if this project is going to get its feet off the ground, then you’re going to need a clearly defined game plan.</p>

        <p>I think the feedback here will be pessimistic at the least. Mopar is a terrible place to organise something of this caliber but I can only hope some people have an open mind and are able to shake of the disappointing attitude that Mopar shares.</p>
<p>Would love to see this in action and it is something that should of happened a very long time ago. Let’s hope that some people can put up their hand and commit to a potential revolution in RS classic dev.</p>

        <p>I fully agree. I began discussing this project also on the Rune Server forum too.</p>
<p>Right now there are not any very java proficient developers working on this. I am currently the only active developer too. The single goal of this is to do everything possible to make the server run just like the Jagex one did, including the quests, skills, everything possible. That is the goal that I have stuck with while working on this in the past.</p>
<p>If those who do know java are interested in further working with this, I would gladly relinquish the head administrator role of this project if it meant better organization. All I am doing is trying to get the ball rolling. I know there are plenty of RSCD servers with improvements that the original source lacks. If we could have some of the code improvements added in then that would be great.</p>
<p>As far as dealing with which code to allow and which to not allow, we would need to make use of the project forum built in with Sourceforge or create our own with polls and have an oversight committee. If anyone here has had experience in doing opensource projects of this nature, such as a linux distro which uses a SVN, I could really use their input with this.</p>

        <p>I like the idea, allthough it wouldn’t make the current state of RSC much better. People want to make their own server, which means there will allways be 20 servers up, and the players are spread amongst the different servers. It would be alot more cooler if there was one server up and gather all the players to this server.</p>
<p>Good idea though, sounds like you really want to make RSC as it was before.</p>

        <p>Thanks Meatstick. Yes, the player base is very divided but when you step back and look at it, the popular servers will always be the ones who are online the most often (reliable) and offer the best feedback to their players. (support)</p>
<p>RSCA for example, has been going for several straight months and their admins seem to be doing a good job when it comes to taking care of player issues. That is why they seem to be one of the most popular servers. By replicating the same service and support, any server can become just as popular. While there may be 20 distributions of the same source, only the ones that are online for more than a few weeks and can maturely mediate problems with players will gather all the majority of the player base.</p>
<p>One last issue: Jagex Intellectual Property. I have made the decision not to include the source files nor the compiled files that include Jagex’s client. Sourceforge cannot ban this project because it is 100% black box reverse engineered code for a server emulation daemon which is legal in the UK and the EU. I believe this is also the case in the US. RSCA had a topic about a Jagex agent trying to send a takedown request and being informed that he could not do anything which resulted in never hearing from him again. From what I learned through a friend who was into the RSCD server Reines ran back with <a href="http://warthog.net/" rel="nofollow noopener">Warthog.net</a>? when he was charging $5/month to play, was that the only reason Jagex was able to take them down was because of the charging for membership to play and the use of their client. Was that the case?</p>
<p>When servers get big enough, Jagex takes notice. Do we need to take any other precautions other than not offering client downloads?</p>

But yea as xEnt said some people may and some people may not help people who needs help because of all the flame at people Some people may not ask for help due to the flame they will get off other people on these forums…</p>

        <p>Thanks xEnt.</p>
<p>I’ve always seen both forums as being flooded by very young and immature members making poor posts. That is the problem when the player base for a game is mostly 13-15 year old children. The way I deal with it is to either provide some sort of help if possible or simply ignore them.</p>

<p>People do not want to help writing code, they just want to take it and make hundreds off of donations. They won’t respect the GPL license, so i wouldn’t even bother with it.</p>

<p>GPL states that you may use the source code for whatever purpose you see fit (including commercial gain)</p>
<p>As for the project, might I suggest that the first and most important thing you tackle is sever stability. Irradicate all known bugs and improve code before you start adding missing features.</p>
<p>RSCDv25’s biggest downfall is its inability to handle large amounts of players (pretty much anything +300)</p>
