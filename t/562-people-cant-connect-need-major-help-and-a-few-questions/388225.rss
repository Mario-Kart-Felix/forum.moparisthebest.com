in teh client.java, i changed the ip to my ip, using cmd (windows command) in cmd, typed ipconfig and got my ip.
Now, i tried, and I connected to my server. So i uploaded teh client, and when my friend downloaded it, it didnt work.
Now Is theer anythign i need to change in teh client, besides client .java? And now for teh source: i cant find if you have to change the ip, beacause i cant find and ip spot.

 lists                                      random
src      ~~end of folders, now files.
