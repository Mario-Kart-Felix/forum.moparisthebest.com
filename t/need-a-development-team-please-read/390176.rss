[center]What I Can Code/How I Can Help[/center]
I can code a list of things. texts all the way to shops/npcs. I can make a training area, shops(only if there is shops on there unless it would take me a long time), KBD, dragons, anything u name it but they might not have the right stats as Runescape but thats why its not called RUNESCAPE!!! Ppl need to learn that -.-...

[center]How Long I&#39;ve Been Coding[/center]
I&#39;ve started out on runescape playing that for a year.. but out of no where i got bored, and i found this from one of my friends in 6th grade (I&#39;m in 8th now). So we joined servers everyone did and we never knew how they made them. So like 5 months later (I&#39;m smarter than my friends but still smoke weed with them and shiz) i go on hamachi and go on a server. I ask the owner to teach me how to code, he tought me the basic how to change the name. So i kept downloading and downloading files till my computer got a virus.. i&#39;m sure some of u out there have done that lol(:, now i&#39;ve started back up nowing how to code(: well thats the end(:

These are just pictures to show you that i can code, this is not even close to what i can make.
