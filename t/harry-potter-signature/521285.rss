    <title>Harry potter signature</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/harry-potter-signature/521285</link>
    <description>I have been using

this avatar:

[img]http://xelios.co.uk/Forum/image.php?u=52&amp;dateline=1370879724[/img]

and this signature:

[img]http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/5028/luvandpowersig.png[/img]

for a very very long time.

I am requesting a new set of avatar/signature please with a similar theme. I want ti to be &quot;magical themed for harry potter similar to what is already shown&quot; I am not picky about renders so use whatever you believe would go best. Be creative. I am not picky about colors either. 

I just ask that it is a .png, around a similar size for each ( I think the avvy is like 85x85 and the signature should be less than 500x500 to meet most forum requirements. )</description>
