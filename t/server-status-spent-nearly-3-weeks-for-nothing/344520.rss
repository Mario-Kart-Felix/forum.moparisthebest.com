    <title>[Server Status] Spent nearly 3 weeks for nothing?</title>
    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/server-status-spent-nearly-3-weeks-for-nothing/344520</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve spent nearly 3 weeks programming my server.
I just got finished registering, when I realized that my server doesn&#39;t allow capital letters in the password.
When verification password has capitals in it..
So now I&#39;m guessing my server won&#39;t get populated and the server status won&#39;t post it. Just thought I&#39;d ask if there&#39;s a way for this to not come in the way of my ad being published?</description>
