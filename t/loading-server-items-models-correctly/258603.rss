    <title>Loading Server items/models correctly</title>

    <description>I&#39;ve done all the stuff i&#39;m supposed to (as far as i know) to add a model, but two of the models and items i have added still aren&#39;t working for me. 

First off, --FIXED--

Secondly, I&#39;ve added Double Energy Swords (they look sweet in the model viewer) and everything checks out fine except for one thing (and i have tried and tried to somehow adjust it). For some reason it always dissapears behind things it shouldn&#39;t, for example it will dissapear behind my plate legs even though its in front of them? Pretty sure this is a model thing, and how do i fix it? Here are the ints:
[CODE]        if(i == 8012)
        {
            class8.aStringArray189 = new String[5];
            class8.aStringArray189[1] = &quot;Wield&quot;;
            class8.anInt174 = 13764;
            class8.anInt181 = 2000;
            class8.anInt190 = 572;
            class8.anInt198 = 0;
            class8.anInt169 = 0;
            class8.anInt194 = 1;
            class8.anInt175 = -1;
            class8.anInt197 = -1;
            class8.anInt199 = -1;
            class8.anInt165 = 13943;
            class8.anInt200 = 13943;
            class8.aBoolean176 = false;
            class8.aString170 = &quot;Dual blood blades&quot;;
            class8.aByteArray178 = &quot;SEXY OMFGWTFBBQ!&quot;.getBytes();
        }[/CODE]

Again, all of the models load, but not quite how i want them to.

Edit: Also when i attack with the dual swords its a punch animation, i&#39;ve already coded my server to use the torag hammers emote when using this weapon, so something is wrong. Help?</description>
