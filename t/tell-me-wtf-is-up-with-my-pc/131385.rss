    <link>https://forum.moparisthebest.com/t/tell-me-wtf-is-up-with-my-pc/131385</link>
    <description>Everytime i try to run a .exe program to setup something it opens but only to see a few seconds after it opens it just closes by itself. Oh yeah, there was also a problem that kept happening with u tube where i tried watching videos and they start over by themselves. And this OTHER HUGE problem:

Guys, my computer is going crazy, because when i start it up, it plays random music that i DO NOT HAVE on my computer, one moment it played some country music, the next its playing the thong song by sisco!! i cannot belive what is going on. no this is not some sick joke this is totally true and i need help deciding wtf is going on.

maybe it had sex with my dell pc and caught a dtd. HELP ME!!!!
